The study involves 30 patients and nine doctors in New York , San Francisco , Los Angeles and Miami . They meet after hours in makeshift treatment rooms and private clinics where doctors administer the drug GLQ223 , which was smuggled from Shanghai. // The drug , which people in the study call compound Q , has shown a striking ability in laboratory experiments to kill cells infected with the AIDS virus and to leave other cells alone , said Dr. Michael McGrath of San Francisco General Hospital , who did the initial laboratory studies on the durg in this country . Also , he said , the drug seems to kill macrophages , scavenger cells of the immune system that are believed to be the reservoir of the AIDS virus in humans. // The Food and Drug Administration said it was beginning an investigation of whether the study is illegal . <> <> Possible Risk Is Seen // Some advocates for AIDS patients praised the secret study , which began in April , as a turning point and an example of how drug testing might be speeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented a risk to the participants and might take advantage of patients clinging to any thread of hope. // A spokesman for the F.D.A. , Jeff Nesbit , said the legal question hinged on whether the drug was imported for personal use or for use in a clinical trial . Personal use is permitted , but importation for a clinical trial is not. // One patient who received the drug last week in the study fell into a coma . He came out of it but died five days later from aspirating vomit . A second patient , severely ill from Kaposi ' s sarcoma of the lung , committed suicide. // Despite the deaths , the coordinators of the clandestine study say they plan to go ahead . Martin Delaney of Project Inform , who conceived of the study and directs it , said the patient who had slipped into the coma " did not die of direct effects of the drug . " <> <> Used in China on Tumors // The study began in April with limited quantities of the smuggled drug but grew to include more patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug was brought into the United States . The patients have received what the study directors think is a therapeutic dose , based what Chinese doctors use in treating other ailments. // Compound Q has long been used in China to induce abortions and to treat certain tumors made of cells that resemble macrophages . As soon as Dr. McGrath announced his findings , the AIDS underground began trying to get the drug out of China. // The patients in the clandestine study receive three doses of the drug at one-week intervals . Their blood is analyzed at a central laboratory in the San Francisco area for signs that the AIDS virus is being thwarted . The data are too preliminary to say yet whether the drug works . Mr. Delaney said the study was expected to expand to 60 patients and may increase the size of the dose , Mr. Delaney said . <> <> Safety Data Passed Along // The official study , which began about a month ago , is being conducted by Dr. Paul Volberding of the University of California at San Francisco for Genelabs Inc. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a dose 20 times smaller than that of the secret study . The dosage has been increased to half that of the clandestine study and will eventually reach and exceed that dose if no negative effects are seen. // Mr. Delaney and others said officials from the Food and Drug Administration were privately kept apprised of the underground study . They said the F.D.A. officials had fed the study ' s data on the drug ' s safety at higher doses to Dr. Volberding. // But , Mr. Nesbit said , " the fact that Mr. Delaney spoke to someone at the F.D.A. does not make this an F.D.A.-sanctioned or F.D.A.-approved study . " <> <> ' We Made a Statement ' // Mr. Delaney said he and the others conceived of and took part in the underground study in part because they felt that compound Q was their last best hope and because they had to know whether it worked before its uncontrolled use became widespread. // Another reason for the study , Mr. Delaney said , was to force the Federal Government to rethink its attitudes on drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Delaney said . He said the drug testing system was designed to protect research subjects by subjecting them to the lowest possible risks. // But he said society should examine whether it was appropriate to take greater risks in AIDS research . " Patients have been saying for years that they wanted to do that and that they will do that if in return we ' d get a quicker answer , " on whether drugs worked , he said. // Mr. Delaney ' s challenge to conventional research has aroused strong emotions . <> <> ' A Real Disservice ' // " I think Marty Delaney is one of the greatest heroes in the country right now , " said Larry Kramer , an advocate for people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome . " This is really historic. " // Dr. Volberding disagreed . " What they ' ve done is a real disservice to volunteers in the study and to a drug that might be interesting , " he said . " It doesn ' t take a genius to hand out drugs to people without controls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions in a rigorous way. " // Michael Callen , a founder of the Community Research Initiative , a group of private doctors who conduct clinical trials to test promising drugs against AIDS , said he was deeply disturbed by the clandestine study. // " I have AIDS and so I am painfully aware of the need to move swiftly , " Mr. Callen said . " But it seems to me that people have charged ahead irresponsibly . Some people are paying the price for that : They have gone into comas and died . " <> <> Help From ' Dextran Man ' // The effort to obtain compound Q in the AIDS underground community followed a familliar pattern , Mr. Delaney said . As soon as a drug looked promising , advocates for AIDS patients found ways of getting it into the country . " With all the previous promising drugs - ribavirin , AL-721 , dextran sulfate - it was the same routine . The community found out how to get the drug , and meanwhile it took three years for the official tests to find out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up . With compound Q , we wanted to find out immediately if it was safe and worth taking. " // To get the drug , Mr. Delaney called James Corti , a registered nurse , bicycle racer and artist in Los Angeles , who said he and his partner , John Upchurch , began smuggling experimental AIDS drugs in 1984 , when they went to Mexico for ribavirin. // About two years ago , Mr. Corti said , he set up an elaborate smuggling network in the Orient that allowed him to mail back hundreds of boxes of dextran sulfate worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to the United States , earning the nickname Dextran Man among AIDS patients . <> <> Tracking Drug ' s Source // In order to get compound Q , Mr. Corti said , he found a Chinese acquaintance in Florida who had gotten the drug from China . Mr. Corti persuaded this man to give him the label from the box . Mr. Corti said his Chinese contacts figured out that the drug came from a factory in Shanghai . The factory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , is the only source of compound Q in China , Mr. Corti said. // In mid-May , Mr. Corti said , he and a Chinese friend flew to China and paid " tens of thousands of dollars " in bribes and spent $1 , 600 in telephone calls to Mr. Delaney in San Francisco , who urged him to spend whatever was necessary to get the drug. // In the end , Mr. Corti got 200 doses of the compound and was escorted with it by Chinese officials out of the country . He said he used the smuggling network he had already set up for dextran sulfate to get the drug into the United States . <> <> First Come , First Served // The directors of the secret study had the smuggled drug analyzed and report that it was even purer than the drug synthesized for the official study. // The study coordinators said they tried to be scrupulously fair to both the doctors and the patients and to select patients for the study in an unbiased manner . But in order to keep the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study they would be kicked out of it. // In New York , said Tom Hannon , an advocate for AIDS patients , the study was kept very quiet . A New York doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said she directed patients who asked her about the compound to Mr. Hannon . Mr. Hannon told the callers about the secret study , and if they wanted to participate , he accepted them in the order that they called. // Then the patient would take the drug to the New York doctor , who would administer it . The patient would be videotaped saying that he was asking the doctor to give him the drug. // The doctor said she hesitated to participate in the study for fear of losing her license . But , she said , " I am doing this because I am desperate . " She said that she believed in working in the system but that she was impatient for a drug that works . " Maybe I want too much , " she said. //          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
