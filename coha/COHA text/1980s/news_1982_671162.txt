The rapid Japanese advance has raised the possibility that the United States could become dependent on a foreign supplier for socalled supercomputers , which are used in weapons development as well as many nonmilitary research applications . The situation is likely to spark renewed debate within the United States about the proper American response to Japanese industrial efforts. // A panel of American computer scientists , in a report that will soon be made public , is urging that the Government undertake a national program to spur development of such supercomputers , which are the fastest calculating machines on earth . Such a program , if adopted , would be one of the first in which the Government , industry and universities collaborate to counter Japanese moves , which are seen as having been so successful in part because of close cooperation between business and Government there. // // Parallel to Semiconductors // " The argument is that in absence of a coordinated Government effort , the Japanese will repeat in computer systems what they did in semiconductors , " said Kent K. Curtis , head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divison of mathematical sciences and computer sciences , in one of a dozen interviews in which officials discussed Japanese advances in making and marketing supercomputers. // Mr. Curtis was referring to the success Japanese electronics companies have had in selling an important computer memory chip , the 64K random access memory . The Japanese have won more than half of that market , which is expected to grow to $1 billion in annual sales in a few years. // Supercomputers are extremely expensive , selling for $5 million to $15 million each , and are designed for large scientific problems involving numerous calculations . They can perform , in some cases , more than 100 million arithmetic operations a second , making them 3 to 100 times faster than the largest general-purpose business computers made by companies such as the International Business Machines Corporation. // There were 50 such supercomputers in use as of last June , largely in national laboratories and other Government facilities . They are used for nuclear weapons design , fusion energy research , weather forecasting and , it is believed , for intelligence and code-breaking by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in industry for tasks such as designing aircraft wings and simulating oil reservoirs . Many of the problems are so complex , involving billions of calculations , that they keep even a supercomputer busy for hours . <> <> Japanese Entry Into Market // Virtually all supercomputers have been made by two American companies , Cray Research Inc. and the Control Data Corporation , both of Minneapolis . Recently , however , two Japanese companies , Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd. , have introduced supercomputers that are roughly comparable in performance to the American models. // Moreover , the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry this year began a project to develop by the end of the decade a machine capable of performing 10 billion operations a second , 100 times faster than the Cray machine , according to American scientists who have visited Japan. // The program , in which Japan ' s six largest computer companies are cooperating , involves financing of $100 million to $200 million a year for eight years , the scientists say . The Japanese also have a separate project to develop a so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be capable of tasks such as understanding speech , making the machines extremely easy to use. // The still unpublished report on the supercomputer situation has been prepared for the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense by a group of 15 scientists and engineeers from universities and national laboratories headed by Peter D. Lax , a professor of mathematics at New York University ' s Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. // The panel was established in part to explore how university researchers could get access to supercomputers , which are becoming vital for basic research . The panel , which includes Kenneth G. Wilson of Cornell University , who last week won the Nobel Prize in Physics , recommends that a program to provide such access be established . <> <> Keeping Pace With Japan // But the panel also became concerned about development of future faster computers and questioned whether American manufacturers could keep pace with the Japanese. // The report does not make specific recommendations other than calling for a national program involving Government agencies , the national laboratories , industry and universities , according to several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that five separate projects be set up to work on advanced computers , that each project involve a consortium of universities and computer companies and that each receive financing of $5 million a year for five years , Professor Lax said. // Concern over Japanese inroads in supercomputers was spurred last spring when teams of scientists from Los Alamos , N.M. , and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories visited Japanese computer centers . The reports of the scientists suggested the Japanese could surpass the American companies and the labs , which design nuclear weapons , would have to buy from the Japanese. // " That jolted a lot of people , " said Jacob T. Schwartz , a professor at the Courant Institute and member of the Lax committee . " Historically Los Alamos has always gone for the biggest and fastest computers available , " said Bill L. Buzbee , assistant director of the Los Alamos computer division . " We would prefer to buy American , but if the biggest and fastest computers were foreign , we would certainly have to consider them . " <> <> Worries About Competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign companies assume leadership in supercomputers , they might not sell the newest computers to American customers for several years , for political or competitive reasons or because they had to satisfy their home market first. // There is at least one precedent : In the late 1960 ' s , the United States Government barred I.B.M. and Control Data from selling France large computers for nuclear weapons development. // The call for a Government-sponsored effort rests on the assumption that industry will not be able to or will not care to take the risks involved to develop radical new approaches that some scientists say would be needed to achieve thousand-fold increases in computer speed. // That recommendation is not likely to find favor in the Reagan Administration , which is emphasizing private enterprise and is trying to cut the Federal budget. // " I have not seen any basis for justifying a massive Federal effort , " said N. Douglas Pewitt , assistant director for general science in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , who said he is familiar with the Lax committee work but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Makers // " The reaction that we have to counter the Japanese plan by becoming Japanese ourselves is not going to wash . That ' s not going to find much support in this Administration , " Dr. Pewitt said. // The supercomputer manufacturers , which have reviewed the Lax committee work , have mixed feelings , applauding the interest shown by the Government but questioning the specific approach. // " It ' s about the first time the Government is beginning to focus on the supercomputer area , " said Lloyd M. Thorndyke , senior vice president for technology at Control Data . " Before that it ' s been almost benign neglect . " He said the company thinks a Government effort is " in the national good . Just how is the question. " // Mr. Thorndyke and Peter A. Gregory , vice president of planning and corporate development for Cray , said the Government should establish a market for supercomputers , either by promising to buy computers of certain specifications or by helping universities purchase supercomputers , and let the companies satisfy the market need. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate on sponsoring development of high speed micro-electronic circuits that would be the building blocks of future high-speed computers , while leaving the computer companies to design and build the computers. // " I ' m less anxious to have 10 universities working on design of computers . I don ' t think that will be that valuable , " Mr. Gregory said . The computer makers also take issue with the technological approach to faster computing advocated by the Lax panel. // The recommendations come at a time when American electronics companies themselves are banding together to share basic research and better compete with the Japanese . In the past year , two organizations have been formed by the companies to share research expenses , in part by funneling research money to the universities . But while cooperating among themselves , the companies have so far spurned direct Government involvement in their activities. //
