A lending scheme that apparently took place on a branch manager 's home computer in Georgia has grown into Italy 's biggest banking scandal in years . Last week the disgrace claimed the two top officers of Italy 's largest bank , the state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro . Chairman Nerio Nesi , 64 , and Director General Giacomo Pedde , 62 , resigned after the bank 's board heard the results of an initial probe into a scam in which the bank 's Atlanta branch gave $2.6 billion worth of unauthorized export credits to Iraq to buy machinery and agricultural goods . <P> The branch manager , Christopher Drogoul , apparently issued the credits and kept the records at home . Drogoul , whose possible motives are still being investigated , has been dismissed . The Italian bank contends that it will suffer no losses from the scheme because the credits were guaranteed by U.S. and Iraqi agencies , but banking experts believe debt-laden Iraq may be hard pressed to make good if the deals go sour .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
