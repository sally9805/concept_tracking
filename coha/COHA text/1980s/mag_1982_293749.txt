A week of fighting proves how deadly is the game <P> Alfred Hitchcock mastered this effect : a fool acts huffy in a dangerous situation ( a battle , an ambush ) . He protests the noise and inconvenience while the bullets pop around him , and the audience chuckles at his posturing . Then suddenly this character is shot ; in The Lady Vanishes ( 1938 ) he examines the blood from his own wound . All at once the audience is not laughing any more . It realizes that what seemed hilarious a moment ago was never really funny in the first place because the context was not funny , because nothing can ever be funny when death is possible . To bring the matter to the Falklands : there is no such thing as a comic war . <P> Why so obvious a fact was not seen before last week 's events-before the destruction of two ships , at least nine aircraft and more than 300 people-was partly a matter of pacing . The three weeks it took for Britain 's fleet to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so it would have proved , had diplomacy worked . But that prolonged stretch of time also allowed a grand illusion to grow in the public mind-the idea that this war was going to be a cultural event , with the participating nations displaying the ceremonies of battle the way some birds display tail feathers , as rituals of violence minus the blood . For the spectators there was more than enough to be amused by , including the Falklands themselves , unknown to the world before April 2 and afterward an anthology of jokes about penguins , sheep and kelp . Those not giggling were celebrating . Argentine children waved flags ; British children waved flags . Except for mothers , who know better , and politicians , who ought to , almost everyone was certain that this was going to be oh such a lovely war , so different from the common run , with all those awkward screams and telegrams . <P> Now dead boys float in the South Atlantic , and there is no doubt on earth what those dark festivals were leading to . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , British armchair admirals were smugly analytical about the deficiencies of the Argentine forces . One day later Mrs. Thatcher listened ashen-faced in the House of Commons as her Defense Secretary announced the death toll from the destroyer Sheffield . Sobered , the world sat upright . It was precisely because the war had seemed so playful initially that it seemed so dreadful now . If anything , it appeared worse than it was , so shocked was everyone by the execution of the inevitable . <P> Of course , a change of mood was not the only reason for the stunned reaction . There is something about this conflict being a war at sea-the first major naval engagement in nearly 40 years-that gives it a terrible stateliness . Ships go down slowly . The people on them die twice : once when hit , once when drowning . They give you time to consider their faces , time to imagine what it was like on that cruiser or destroyer , after the sides of the vessel were punctured and there was a scrambling for rafts and then a silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , black water . Memory mingles with imagination . Easy to visualize , the war seems larger than it is.
