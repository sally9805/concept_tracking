Top business executives are decidedly optimistic that the economy will improve this year . More than in any of the past three years , the executives think conditions will get better . They predict inflation will stay down , the prime rate will remain steady and the stock market will rise moderately . " Business should be better than in 1983 , " says the chief executive officer of a manufacturing company . " No. 1 , it ' s an election year . No. 2 , it ' s the end of the recession and the beginning of control on inflation . " Says the chairman of an industrial-equipment company : " We can look forward to a continued recovery . Not a massive recovery  --  it will proceed as it has , maybe more restrained . " Says the chairman of a company that makes recreational products : " It ' s going to be an up year . " These are among the findings of a Wall Street Journal/Gallup survey of 822 executives . Results are based on telephone interviews with 317 chief executives selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief executives from medium-sized companies and the heads of 202 small companies . The interviews were conducted during a three-week period in early December . Most of the executives don ' t have anything negative to say about the economic outlook for this year . Only about one in 10 executives at the large companies and two in 10 at smaller concerns volunteer anything negative when asked how 1984 will be different from 1983 for business . A year ago , nearly twice as many executives in each category had something negative to say . Many executives mentioned the importance of increased spending on plants and industrial equipment . " We ' re building longrange investments , which have been sparse , " says the chief executive of a steel company . " Capital expenditures in smokestack industries will increase , which , in turn , will increase employment and further capital activity . " The chief executive of a steel processor says " 1984 will be a better year . Plants will be operating at useable capacity . Unemployment will be down and employment up . " Many executives also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year  --  although they don ' t all agree on what the effect will be . " The pumps will be primed and efforts will be made to reduce unemployment , " says the chairman of an engineering and construction company . Says the chairman of a manufacturing company : " There will be less political maneuvering ; taxes and other budgetary problems will be in limbo . There ' s an uncertainty in the business community , but I think 1984 will be a solid year for business . " The chairman of an industrial-equipment company reflects the election-year optimism : " Ron and Nancy like the life style in the White House and want to stay there , so they will push increased confidence in the economy . " But the president of a retailing company says optimism about the economy is " an artificial difference created by an election year . There will be nothing different stimulating businessmen in 1984 . People hypnotize themselves when business looks good . Business will drop drastically in ' 84 in the first quarter when people realize that their paychecks aren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few executives share that wariness about the economic outlook . " Some industries will do better in ' 84 , but there will be no great change in the domestic marketplace , " says the chief executive of a heavy-equipment manufacturer . " Capital goods will improve slowly . Overall , we ' ll see a gradual improvement in U.S. business in 1984 , provided that interest rates encourage consumer spending and we can balance the budget . " Here are some of the executives ' specific forecasts for this year and beyond : THE RECOVERY : Executives are confident about the recovery . Six in 10 large-company chiefs say the recovery is strong or very strong ; a third say it is moderate . Only 2% of the executives at the large companies characterize the recovery as weak . Most of the executives expect the recovery to continue through the year ; only about one in 10 expects a downturn this year . At the large companies , for example , executives most often predict that the economy will turn down in 1985 . At the small and medium-sized companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executives at small companies and one-fourth at medium-sized companies say they don ' t know when the economy will turn down again . INTEREST RATES : The majority of executives at large and medium-sized concerns expect the prime interest rate to be 10% or 11% at year-end , about what it is now . That ' s an unusual consensus ; in past surveys , executives disagreed much more on what the prime rate would be . ( Even this year , small-company executives are divided . About a third expect the prime rate to be 10% to 11% , but another third expect it to be 12% to 13% . ) At all sizes of companies , though , executives are less likely than a year ago to say the prime rate will drop below 10% . Last year , for example , more than a third of the large-company executives expected the prime rate to fall below 10% . This year , only about one in 10 does . Nonetheless , executives seem happy that rates have fallen as far as they have . " If we still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the dumps , " says the chief executive of a manufacturing company . Says the chief executive of a steel company : " There ' s no way the economy can keep up if rates don ' t stay down . " INFLATION : Executives expect the inflation rate at the end of this year to be 5% to 6% , slightly more than the late 1983 rate of 4. 9% . Executives at small companies again seem far less certain than executives at the larger companies . Although their average prediction is also 5% to 6% , about onefourth of the small-company executives say they don ' t know what the rate will be , and predictions from the other three-fourths vary widely . At all sizes of companies , executives seem less certain about long-term inflation rates . On average , heads of large and medium-sized companies predict that the rate will be 7% to 8% three years from now , but the range of predictions is wide . At small concerns , only about half the executives offered a long-term estimate , but among those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any event , the executives are more optimistic now than they were three years ago . In 1980 , more than half the large-company executives predicted that the inflation rate at the end of 1983 would be 8% or higher . Instead , it was running at about 5%-an improvement that the executives say has been important . " The lower inflation rate was the key to the recovery , " says the chairman of a manufacturing company . Adds the chairman of an airline : " The inflation rate has the capability of great damage to the U.S. if not kept under control . " STOCK MARKET : More than two-thirds of the executives at large companies and about half those at medium-sized and small concerns expect the stock market to rise moderately this year . Executives at small companies are the most pessimistic ; onefourth of them expect no significant movement . Compared with the past three years , the stock-market predictions have changed little . Executives at the large companies are a bit more pessimistic  --  fewer expect a sharp rise in the market . And executives at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were last year  --  the number expecting an upswing has grown by about eight percentage points while the number expecting a downturn has dropped by a similar amount .
