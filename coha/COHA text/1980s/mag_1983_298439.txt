<P> The political front heats up <P> <P> As weary U.S. diplomats know all too well , the protracted civil war in El Salvador is as much a psychological struggle as a military one . In military terms , the war remains at a stalemate . On other fronts , however , the struggle is definitely heating up .

Enders , chief architect of the State Department 's policy toward El Salvador , had recommended to the National Security Council that negotiations with the guerrillas get under way .

" Despite that denial , signs pointed to another round of political infighting over El Salvador .
