Eichmann 's plea for a reprieve f 4 " he Gods I worshiped demanded the I dance of death . I had no choice , and whoever claims otherwise is a liar . " So wrote Adolf Eichmann , after his four-month 1961 trial in Israel , as he attempted to justify his role in the wartime deaths of millions of Jews . The onetime SS officer who was chiefly responsible for carrying out the Final Solution of the Third Reich 's " Jewish problem " even insisted that he was not antiSemitic . Eichmann had made that claim somewhat obliquely in court and more directly in a lengthy " confession " to a German journalist that was published by LIFE in 1960 . He repeated that disavowal in a little-known , long suppressed personal memoir that is now coming to light . Declared Eichmann : " The Holocaust was the greatest crime in history . I was never taken in by the mysticism of Nazi ideology . My views never matched the official line . I could never identify with the objectives of national socialism . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazism are contained in a rambling account of his life that Eichmann wrote in prison while awaiting the results of an appeal of his conviction . ( The appeal was rejected by Israel 's Supreme Court , and on May 31 , 1962 , he was executed by hanging . ) The apparent purpose of his memoir was to bolster his chances of a reprieve and to arouse public sympathy . Eichmann asked his defense attorney , Robert Servatius , to seek permission for its publication . The trial prosecutor , Gideon Hausner , refused ; then Premier David Ben-Gurion ordered that the manuscript be suppressed for 15 years and placed in the state archives . Its existence was known to only a few people . <P> Portions of the memoir will be contained in an updated Hebrew edition of Hausner 's 1966 book on the trial , Justice in Jerusalem , which will be published in Israel this March . Hausner , who is now chairman of the Yad Vashem memorial to Holocaust victims in Jerusalem , feels the entire manuscript should not be published on the grounds that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the typical Nazi " jargon of violence . " Besides , adds Israel 's former Attorney General , " I felt that Eichmann had ample opportunity to make his defense during the trial , and did not feel that we owed him any other platform . " <P> <P> Nonetheless , the excerpts that Hausner does include contain some interesting tidbits . Although Eichmann , prior to his arrest , had proudly professed his allegiance to Hitler , he warns in his memoir " against following idols , like the parched bones drying up in the desert . " The warning was directed to both the next generation- " The youth of the world should unite . The adults failed " - and to women - " Maybe women should be entrusted with the responsibility for the world because they are led by emotion and not by intellect . Maybe they would do better than we did . " Eichmann also discloses that he had been ordered to check out the racial origins of the " Diet Chief , " the code name for Hitler 's mistress , Eva Braun .
