The entire Northeast corridor , from Boston to Richmond , has what the officials and experts believe is the nation ' s heaviest concentration of toxic chemicals and chemical wastes in the environment. // Dr. Irving J. Selikoff , the director of the department of environmental medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , calls the corridor " cancer alley " because he is convinced that the cancer rates in the area , which he said are among the highest in the country , are attributable in part to the concentration of the chemical industry there . <> <> Industry Disputes Cancer Cause // Other experts cite other potential explanations for a high cancer rate - for example , a rising proportion of the elderly in the population . And the chemical industry itself disputes the contention that it is responsible for the high rates . Gordon D. Strickland , the deputy technical director of the Chemical Manufacturers Association , agreed that the region " historically has been a high cancer area . " But he added : " No one has ever found the cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry. " // Mr. Strickland also argued that the number of cancer deaths had been dropping despite the growth of the chemical industry . But he acknowledged that the Northeast probably had a higher concentration of toxic substances than any other part of the United States. // Within the region , particularly in a narrow strip that extends from New York to Washington , are thousands of generators of toxic waste . They include chemical plants , oil refineries , high-technology manufacturers that use exotic chemicals and thousands of hazardous-waste disposal sites , many of them abandoned and thus not controlled . <> <> Turnpike ' s Sights and Smells // Nowhere are the sights and smells of that concentration more unmistakable than along the New Jersey Turnpike . In the Linden-Rahway area , for example , the road traverses a vast warren of pipes , tanks , retorts and gas towers that form petroleum , chemical and pharmaceutical plants bearing such names as Exxon , Union Carbide , Du Pont , American Cyanamid and Merck. // At the other end , near Wilmington , the Delaware River is flanked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side and a sprawling municipal solid waste dump on the other. // But what can be seen and smelled from the New Jersey Turnpike is only a fraction of the toxic material produced , transported and disposed of in the region. // William N. Hedeman Jr. , the director of the Environmental Protection Agency ' s toxic waste cleanup program , said the Northeast is an " alphabet soup " of toxic hazards . <> <> Aggressive Response to Threat // " Thousands upon thousands of releases of toxic substances into the environment " occur each year , Mr. Hedeman said . Such releases , he and other Federal officials said in recent interviews , pose a threat to the quality of air , surface water and , increasingly and perhaps most dangerously , the underground drinking water supplies. // The biggest cleanup action yet undertaken by the environmental agency is at Bridgeport , N.J. , south of Camden , where it is building a special incinerator to dispose of 50 million gallons of PCB ' s , toluene , benzene and other substances on a 27-acre site that abuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The agency estimates it will cost about $55 million to clean up the site , which contains a 12-acre lagoon filled with contaminated oil and other liquid waste. // Federal officials agree that the Northeast has probably responded more aggressively to the toxic threat than any other region. // Mr. Hedeman said New York and New Jersey " are clearly many years ahead of the rest of the country in dealing with uncontrolled hazardous waste sites . " He noted that New Jersey had built up a " massive fund " for dealing with waste problems and that New York had instituted a tax on chemical wastes . Both states have been " aggressive in identifying and assessing sites , " he said , and both have gathered highly trained scientists and technicians to deal with uncontrolled wastes. // Michael B. Cook , the deputy director of the environmental agency ' s office of solid waste , which helps regulate waste handlers and disposers , said the New England states were " way out front " in developing rules for controlling leaking underground tanks. // Such tanks , particularly those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived in recent years as a serious threat to underground water supplies . <> <> ' Very Enlightened ' Delegation // " There is a well-entrenched environmental community that helps us focus on programs , " said Michael R. Deland , the Environmental Protection Agency ' s regional administrator for New England . " We also have a very enlightened and conscientious Congressional delegation. " // The Northeast Hazardous Waste Coordination Committee , set up by state attorneys general to coordinate enforcement of state and Federal toxic waste laws and to provide training and information , is the only such group in the country. // But the states in the Northeast have been more remiss than other regions in taking responsibility for disposal of wastes , Federal officials say. // In the environmental agency ' s three regions covering the Northeast , there is only one toxic-waste incinerator , near Camden , and there are two landfills at Niagara Falls , N.Y. Most of the waste generated in the area is shipped out for disposal elsewhere . The three regions cover the New England states ; New York and New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Virginia and the District of Columbia. // The dimensions of the problem can be expressed in a few numbers . Of the 812 dumps on or proposed for the E.P.A. ' s " national priority list " of high-risk sites eligible for cleanup funds , 301 , about 37 percent , are in the agency ' s three Northeastern regions , and 97 of them , almost 12 percent , are in New Jersey. // On a national map that designates each site with a black dot , " you can ' t even see New Jersey , " Representative Florio said . " It has disappeared. " // The agency ' s list of toxic waste sites that may eventually need attention now stands at around 20 , 000 , and about 5 , 000 of them , 25 percent , are in the three Northeastern regions . <> <> ' Getting a Grip ' on Problems // " Clearly we are at the top or near the top in terms of the numbers of problems we face , " said Christopher J. Daggett , the administrator of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think we are getting a grip on the problems , " he added , particularly with the Federal program for cleaning up uncontrolled waste sites. // Mr. Deland , of the agency ' s New England region , agrees that the Northeast and the country as a whole have made progress in dealing with toxic waste . But he adds : // " Citizens have to recognize that as an industrialized nation we can no longer generate 280 million tons of toxic waste every year along with a ton of conventional wastes for every person in the country. // " It means we are going to have to change our life styles , and that industry is going to have to change its methods , to detoxify or recycle waste or not produce it . The time has come for society to look at this problem and realize that we must make massive changes. " //
