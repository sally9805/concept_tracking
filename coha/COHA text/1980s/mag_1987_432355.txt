 | A small boy arrives home from school one day and tells his parents that he has just been attacked by a monster . It was a close call , the boy explains nervously , and he was lucky to escape alive , but the beast did manage to grab his report card and rip up the part containing his grades . Such a tall tale would no doubt be standard fare on the " Cosby Show " or " Leave It to Beaver . " But the story , in fact , was told to a campaign audience this month by the intensely private front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination . The anecdote , about the candidate 's son , John , when he was a youngster , drew appreciative chuckles from the small audience in Texas . And in its own way , it speaks volumes about one of the most remarkable but littlenoted phenomena in the unfolding 1988 race : The greening of Gary Hart . Where 's the soul ? Through 12 years in the Senate and a marathon White House campaign in 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People are not electing their best friend , " says Hart . " They 're electing someone who can lead the country . " Among Hart 's key issues : Opposition to trade protectionism , commitment to a leaner but stronger defense and some form of tax increase for the wealthy to reduce the budget deficit . In his rush to embrace ideas , however , Hart has raised questions about whether he is a too cerebral and soulless technocrat . Now , as the 1988 campaign moves into high gear with his declaration of candidacy this week , Gary Hart is beginning to lift the veil of secrecy in an effort to win the deeper support that has to this point eluded him despite his impressive front-runner poll figures . " He knows people wo n't listen to his ideas , " says a Democratic strategist and Hart friend , " if the personal questions persist . " Earlier this month , the former Colorado senator took reporters to his hometown of Ottawa , Kans. , where he was known as Gary Hartpence , to trace his roots . Hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luck about his upbringing and values . And he seems more willing than ever to take advice , admit past mistakes and simply relax , joking easily with strangers and inserting self-deprecatory remarks into his speeches . " The questions are not going to be answered with one speech or a single written document , " says his chief campaign spokesman , Kevin Sweeney . " It will take time , but people are going to recognize a lot of things in Hart that they did n't see before . " Critics insist that what people will recognize is a pattern of opportunism and insecurity . Already , Democratic rivals are resurrecting the " character isLooking to back up the big poll numbers As the supply-side signal caller whose tax-cutting ideas were adopted by Ronald Reagan , Kemp is too big a name to rate as a dark horse . But just 10 months before the first caucus in Iowa and the first primary in New Hampshire , he is struggling to stay in the No. 3 GOP slot behind Vice President George Bush and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient for a touchdown ? or even a first down . Kemp , however , seems unlikely to score in either Iowa or New Hampshire . " In Iowa , " says state GOP Chairman Mike Mahaffey , " Jack Kemp has yet to catch on . " sue " of the ' 84 campaign and portraying Hart as a man uncomfortable with himself , a loner constantly reinventing his personality . Aides to some rivals , for example , dismiss the Ottawa trip as a publicity stunt contrived to alter perceptions that Hart is at war with his past .  | The old stories about how Hart changed his name , altered his signature and allowed errors about his age to go uncorrected have already been trotted out by some rivals on the campaign trail . But campaign manager William Dixon dismisses this as a " conspiracy of character assassination from Republicans and Democrats who do n't want Gary Hart to be President . " Money elusive despite polls Only last week , however , Hart 's unpredictable side was on view once again as he canceled media interviews in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address . " I 'm sure his staff will tell you it 's a new , improved Gary Hart model , one with bigger fins and more horsepower , " says a top aide to a prominent Democrat . " But beyond the cosmetics , I 'm not sure much is different . " There are sound political reasons for Hart to drop his penchant for privacy . Despite a 30-point lead in the polls ? largely because of his high name recognition ? there has been no rush by party leaders and veteran moneymen to endorse the front-runner , who is still struggling to pay off his $1.3 million campaign debt remaining from 1984 . Some Democrats in Congress wonder if Hart is too stubborn and too much the outsider to work with them . Others say he is a buttoned-down Jimmy Carter , an intellectual with a firm grasp of issues but little ability to get things done . " There always was and remains a mystique about what he is all about , what he wants to accomplish , " says a prominent Republican who dealt with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was aloof , a back wailer . " Hart and his new band of strategists headquartered in Denver , including campaign manager Dixon and political director Paul Tully , argue that Americans want a non-Establishment leader who understands the issues , does n't get bogged down in details and resists the special-interest pressures of Washington while seeking new solutions to the country 's problems . They argue that any self-doubts are gone and that today Hart is a mellower , more confident leader ready to govern . Whether it is a new sense of selfassurance or a sharp-eyed calculation of Hart 's political debits and credits , nearly everyone agrees that , if he succeeds in projecting a more human image and can somehow give America a better idea of his values and background , his high poll numbers will soon acquire the heft of popular support that is now lacking . And if that happens , Gary Hart will be a very tough opponent indeed . " If the public grows comfortable with him personally , he 'll win the nomination , " White House political director Frank Donatelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else . It 's his to lose .
