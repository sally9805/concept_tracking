Patricia and Francis O'Malley bought their summer home in Long Island 's fashionable Westhampton Beach four years ago . " There used to be a dune in front and a beach in front of that , " Patricia recalls . " The very first winter we had a horrible storm , and we lost the dune . " Two years later gale- force winds blew the house 's roof and top floor off . " We rebuilt a whole new house . Since then , we 've lost 8 ft. of sand . " Now , she complains , " there 's water under the house . The steps are gone . The houses on both sides of ours are gone . " She adds bitterly , " And they say you ca n't lose in real estate . " The O'Malleys figure their home will wash away completely by next year . The potential loss : hundreds of thousands of dollars . <P> Jan and Bill Alford 's troubles began during the devastating winter storms of 1982 . That January a 15-ft. chunk of earth slid away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calif. , about 30 miles north of San Francisco , and crashed to the beach below . A year later another 15 ft. vanished , leaving the house just a few feet from the edge of a 160-ft. cliff . So , in the summer of 1984 , the Alfords moved their 1,300-sq. - ft. house 32 ft. back from the edge . Then came Valentine 's Day 1985 . Following unusually high tides , 30 ft. of land dropped into the sea . The foundation of the house remained just a foot from the precipice , with nothing but air between the guest-room deck and the surf below . <P> " We loved the lot , " says Jan . " On a clear day , you could see all the way to San Francisco . We tried everything to save it , but the erosion just did n't stop . " Last autumn the Alfords moved their home again , this time hauling it a third of a mile to a new site more than 300 ft. from the cliffside . The cost of the two moves : $80,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . The scourge of coastal erosion is felt worldwide , especially in such countries as Britain , West Germany and the Netherlands , where oceanfront property has been heavily developed . In the U.S. , entire coastal areas are disappearing into the sea . Virtually every mile of shoreline is affected in every state that borders an ocean , as well as those on the five Great Lakes , where large chunks of waterfront property have been lost or damaged due to record-high water levels in recent years . Some 86% of California 's 1,100 miles of exposed Pacific shoreline is receding at an average rate of between 6 in. and 2 ft. a year ( the cover photo shows the coast northwest of Santa Barbara ) . Monterey Bay , south of San Francisco , loses as much as 5 ft. to 15 ft. annually . Cape Shoalwater , Wash. , about 70 miles west of Olympia , has been eroding at the rate of more than 100 ft. a year since the turn of the century ; its sparsely settled sand dunes have retreated an astounding 12,000 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
