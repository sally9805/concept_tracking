space . Even a benign tumor is a dreaded development . Too much pressure can cause the base of the brain to be pushed into the spinal column in the neck and cause sudden death . Brianna was admitted immediately to Riley Hospital for Children at the Indiana University Medical Center . The pediatric neurologist and the ear , nose , and throat doctors pondered her condition , conferring about whether or not to give her a spinal tap . Ruling out the spinal tap , they decided to give her a CT scan . It showed nothing abnormal . They scheduled an MRI for that evening at the earliest moment the equipment would become available . It was being serviced but would be available at 11 p.m. that night . So , fortunately , little Brianna underwent MRI where Dr. Klatte is chairman of the department and had helped to save Bob Silvers ' life . The surprise the MRI revealed was that Brianna 's problem was not a brain tumor at all . Then when a tube was put into her left ear to drain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be draining from her left ear . The ear infection had perforated the coverings of the brain , allowing the fluid to leak into the ear . The residents of Indiana University Medical School had never seen such an ear infection , and the older faculty members had n't seen one in recent years . For Beth 's little Brianna , MRI had been a godsend , saving her from having to endure further time-wasting , invasive tests to rule out a suspected brain tumor when fast treatment of the infection was of the essence . Just in time , the proper antibiotics brought her around . Her speech has come back , and her eyes are no longer crossed . although her left eye still points inward when she gets tired . For the most part , however , she is on the road to complete recovery . But I still get goose flesh just thinking about what could have happened had it not been for MR1 right across the creek from our offices . To better appreciate this miracle , let 's turn back the pages of medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of a medical problem was n't readily apparent , " exploratory surgery " often became the next step . Unfortunately , despite these surgeries , or perhaps because of them , the patient did n't always improve . Then the question arose , how to look inside the body without first cutting it open . This led to the area of medical science called radiology , beginning with X-ray images . In recent years , medicine has ridden the wave of high technology . Researchers have developed dramatic new ways to look inside our bodies . Thus , in addition to ordinary X-rays , we have X-rays using materials for contrast , such as barium ; X-rays assisted by computers ( CT scans ) ; radioactive elements that can be sent to various places in the body and then counted ; and sound waves ( ultrasound ) . And now Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI . The incredibly complicated technology behind MRI can be explained by a few examples . Our bodies are made up of chemicals , and chemicals are composed of atoms . Each atom has at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a ball with a stick driven through it , we can pretend it is a spinning top . All of us have seen how , when a top spins , the stick wobbles or swings in a circle . The stick is called the spin axis , and the path the stick follows as it wobbles is called the precessional path . Normally the spin axis of an atom could point anywhere , and its neighbors ' could point anywhere else . But if we put this group of atoms in a strong magnetic field , the sticks tend to move around until they all point in generally the same direction . Remove the magnetic field , and the sticks will move independently until they are again arranged randomly . The speed with which an axis lines up and with which it falls away is affected by two conditions : the kind of atom and the kind of " world " it is in . MRI takes advantage of these properties . A person , composed of lots of different atoms in different worlds , is placed inside a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly , creating pulses of magnetism . The atoms line up and fall away with each pulse , each type of atom behaving a little differently from the others . The energy of all this change is picked up , and that information is fed into a computer . Then the computer can make a picture . For example , the wall of the intestine is different from what is inside it ; fat is different from the intestine ; the stomach is different from fat or the intestine ; and water or blood is different from the rest . Using these facts , the computer can create a picture looking exactly like the way we are arranged inside . With the aid of these magnets and computers , the equipment can see through hone to the soft tissue underneath . Thus it is especially valuable in diagnosing brain and nervous-system disorders such as multiple sclerosis , brain tumors , and strokes . It can see into the heart and into aneurisms . It can spot cancers and infections , even in the bone . MRI is especially useful in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of seeing into the lower , back part of the skull . It can be used to analyze the flow of blood in arteries . It has a future in the examination of arms and legs and their ligaments . In some cases , more invasive studies done today may be replaced by MRI . Consider another of the wonderful THE SATEIRDRY EVENING POST diagnostic results that occurred in Phoenix , Arizona . At age two , Nathan Tower developed severe aches in his left ear and frequently vomited . In June 1985 , when he was nearly five , those earaches were joined by terrible headaches , for which painkillers brought no relief . Trying to trace the cause of this constant pain eventually took the frantic mother to 11 different doctors , some of whom 57 viewed her as neurotic or worse . In the meantime Nathan 's health was deteriorating rapidly . He lost the use of his left hand and arm and began losing the use of his left leg . In July , his distraught parents took him to Reno , Nevada , for tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain stem . The doctors agreed that it was inoperable . However , through a roundabout channel of communication , the desperate mother finally contacted a doctor who urged the Towers to take Nathan to Phoenix 's Barrow Neurological Institute at St. Joseph 's Hospital and Medical Center , where MR1 equipment had been installed only two months before . As he was being eased into the six-foot-long " torpedo tube " for the MR1 scan , little Nathan looked up at his mother and asked , " Mommy , is this a space-ship ? " No , not a spaceship , but as far as the Towers were concerned , the results were certainly as far-reaching . The remarkably clear image showed a tumor lying at the base of Nathan 's brain . It was safely removed in an eight-hour operation . The surgeon said of the procedure : " With the MRI we are able to see brain structures we could never see before . Ten years ago this child would have died . " Because MRI can depict soft tissues in high contrast , it has proved an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bob Silvers ' case . Before MRI , doctors who wanted to look at the spinal cord had to inject an X-ray contrast agent into the fluid which surrounds it , a procedure that could be risky and painful . Now , thanks to MRI , patients like seven-month-old Ashleigh Slaughter are spared this risk and pain . The clear image of her malignant tumor between the kidney and spinal column was shown to be entering the spinal canal and compressing the cord . Fearing the trauma of spinal surgery on a patient so young , doctors at UCLA used chemotherapy toshrink the tumor before trying to remove it . Ashleigh responded so well to the medicine , however , that no surgery was necessary . MRI showed that the tumor had vanished from her body . Lucky ? Yes , you might call sufferers such as Bob Silvers , Brianna Knight , Nathan Tower , and Ashleigh Slaughter lucky . Lucky that someone knew of MR1 and that it was available . However , 400 MR1 centers in the United States are pitifully few for giving promise of help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this equipment could expose . These lifesavers are thus being installed on large mobile vans so that several hospitals can share the equipment by using it one day a week . What this means is , should you ever feel that you have n't had an accurate diagnosis , ask your doctor if MRI might help reveal the problem . If so , ask him where the nearest MRI can be found . It is painless. . . it is not known to have any harmful effects . . . there is no irradiation. . . and there are no scars . For all of MRI 's many advantages , there are some restrictions to this method . It ca n't be done with people on pacemakers . Those who have had metal clips used inside them during an operation should not have this exam . The same goes for armed services veterans carrying bullets or shrapnel in their bodies , as the magnet pulling them out would be like being shot or injured a second time . If a joint has been replaced with a metal prosthesis , the radiologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intensive care can not be examined because the life-support equipment ca n't be in the same room with MRI . While there is no evidence that it is harmful to pregnant women , it 's best not to take chances . MRI is of particular value to children . Parents may be in the exam room with the child to comfort and hold his hand at no risk to the parents .
