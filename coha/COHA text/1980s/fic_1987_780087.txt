 | toward the jungle clearing . Seamus O'Neill , not a paragon of religious devotion by a long shot , but not exactly an agnostic either , breathed a short prayer . " If it 's all the same to Yourself , 1 'd like it to be a safe landing ; well , one I can walk away from anyway . " And while I have your attention , I 'd certainly not be rejecting any help and protection you be after willing to provide for this little jaunt of mine , begging your pardon for seeming forward . " Seamus assumed that Himself ( or Herself , as you pleased ) was fully aware of the situation . Still , it did n't hurt to bring matters up occasionally  --  with proper respect , of course . The old shuttlecraft settled onto the firm red soil of the clearing with as much dignity as its weary hull could manage . There was little dust , just as Podraig the foulmouthed computer had predicted . " Touchdown , " Seamus informed the stars , in case they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , this one intended for Himself , the stars , the Lady Deirdre , and anyone else in the cosmos who might be listening  --  the immemorial protest of the Celt against his unfair destiny . It was a historic moment about which no one cared , the landing on a new planet . Even a thousand years after the Second Great Exploration , landing on a new planet should be a major event , should n't it ? he asked the Deity . The latter Worthy did not deign to answer . Well , admittedly , the dominant species here is supposed to have come about the same time the Proto-Celts came to Tara . We became pilgrims because we wanted to keep alive our culture ; they because they wanted to build a perfect society . So my belated arrival here is something of an anticlimax . But still ... But still , what ? Repressing an urge for yet a fourth  --  and even louder ? sigh and removing his crash helmet , Seamus gazed out the shamrock-shaped observation window above the Dev 's console . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | well as the final chance for the end of the lona 's pilgrimage . Still , Zylong was indeed the most beautiful planet he had ever seen  --  perhaps , as Commodore Fitzgerald had said , one of the most beautiful in the galaxy . During the decades of the lona 's erratic and dubious pilgrimage in search of a world that wanted its scholarship and service , O'Neill had set foot on many life-supporting planets . Sometimes he had landed in peace , sometimes armed to the teeth in the company of his fellow soldiers of fortune , the Wild Geese  --  mind you , only in self-defense , for the Tarans were basically a peaceloving and noncombative people . Why fight with others when you can fight much more constructively and with no bloodshed among yourselves ? Anyway , the Rule of the Holy Order was strict : their mission was to keep alive the Spirit of Exploration during the long interludes between the Great Explorations and to land and establish a permanent monastery on only the planets that needed and wanted them . God knows , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Ah , but do they want us ? That 's the issue , my boy , is n't it ? The Holy Order no more made converts than did St. Columcile in Switzerland or St. Donatus in Italy or St. Killian in Bavaria long ago during the First Exploration . Peregrinationes pro Christo . If the natives were so impressed by the scholarship and service of the monks that they became interested in the Faith , that was another matter . Would they be interested here in this great , terrible heathen place ? Seamus doubted it . Moreover , he doubted that they would want anything to do with the Iona or anything it stood for . Of course , there were ways of interpreting the regulations . Heathen place it was , but luxuriant too . A wonderful place to bed a " proper woman , " always supposing that you could find one such to begin with . None of the planets he had visited compared with the pictures of the Iona 's home planet , Tara , to say nothing of  | that misty island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Zylong in its lushness approximated the beauties of those homes more closely than anything he had seen . The painter who had created the scene in his window had laid on all the colors with a wild and heavy hand . It looked like a slick picture taken from one of the tattered old books in the monastery library , too rich , too lush to be real . The greens were too thick , the blues too deep , the reds and purples too rich . And best of all , it was not rushing through hyperspace at a rate several times the speed of light . " Ah , " Seamus O'Neill murmured to himself , " ' t is the perfect planet for us to settle , save that the locals might not exactly want us , worse luck for them . Give us the slightest hint that we 're welcome , and sure we 'll be here , bag and baggage , to stay . We 'll not interfere with them at all , but give us a few years and they 'll be after sighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had come on the Napper Tandy with his lead platoon of Wild Geese , he would not have to wait for the initiative of the other side . He did not think of himself mainly as a soldier ; it was something he did because on a pilgrimage you had to have soldiers . Mind you , he was not altogether incompetent as an officer . Were n't there those on the Iona who , bad luck to them , argued vigorously that he was better at being an officer than he was at his other profession of bard . Spying , however , was not his line of work . Not at all , at all . He was prepared for death , if needs be . If it were all the same to Himself , he 'd postpone death for a few years . A few decades , even . There were a number of tasks he 'd just as soon finish before the account books were closed . Like persuading a proper woman to share his proper bed for the rest of his life . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of harmless if very distracting fantasies about amusements one might enjoy with such a proper woman . First of  | you loss her very , tgentl y and then ... Well , if it 's all right with , he interrupted whatever the Deity was about with anher request , I 'd like a few years of someone like that next to me night . However , mortality rates on pilgrimages were high among both monks and Wild Geese . If his life were to be as short as his parents ' lives had been , well , there was no good purpose served by complaining about it . Spying was different ; whatever fancy names the Commodore gave to his mism , he was still a spy . He came along on the tiny Dev , armed not with a laser pistol but with a small harp , dressed not in the proud uniform of a commandant but in the dull gray of ? wandering minstrel . There would be no electronic communication with the Iona ; the Zylongi were not to be aware of her existence until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telepathic powers would be in use  --  weak and skittleh as they were . I 'm to charm them with my wit and song  --  and Himself knows rm a great bard no matter what those blatherskites on the Iona say ut me . But while I 'm awing them with my songs and stories , m supposed to be finding out what makes this heathen place tick . A hazy sun , turned rose by the thick upper atmosphere , was beginning to decline from its zenith . Its light softened the edges of the surrounding thick green foliage and deep crimson flowers , and the golden stream flowing nearby . A nice place , O'Neill thought . I would n't mind raising wee ones here at all , at all . It was in the nature of things that the proper woman in your proper bed , properly disrobed and loved , was a requisite for having wee ones to raise . So far , Seamus had not done all that well , despite his brilliant fantasies , in dealing with that requisite . I 'll probably end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to become crusty . Then , having enjoyed his self-pity almost as much as he enjoyed his imagining about the proper woman , he got reluctantly from the pilot 's couch . It was time for work . He had been briefed to expect a hot humid atmosphere ,  | but the wall of moisture he met leaving the I ) ev startled him . The fragrance of the flowers was as strong as their color , an overwhelming sweet scent , like the monastery greenhouse at Easter . Or a wake . O'Neill 's poet 's gown began to stick to his body . He unzipped the front of it , thinking again about the proper woman and about the possibilities of zipping and unzipping her garments . Steady , now , Seamus O'Neill , Commandant in the Wild Geese , you have better things to think about than undressing a woman . Have I now ? Like what , for instance ? Well , like the fact that the Lady Deirdre is monitoring all your thoughts . Ah , sure she 's a woman of taste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fantasies , would she ? You 'd better not be taking a chance . Ah , ' t is yourself , Seamus O'Neill , who has a good point there . Virtuously , he raised the zipper on his poet 's gown . " Peace to this planet . " He repeated the usual Taran greeting and knelt on one knee , making a perfunctory sign of the cross . " ' T is neither ours nor theirs , " he added a prayer of his own , " but Yours . Protect it and us and them from all evil . Grant that I may bring to the good that is here something that is better , and to the bad , healing to make it good . " He paused to consider the elegance of his prayer , simple , heartfelt , appropriate . Not all that bad for a spur-of-the-moment effort . Pleased with his creativity as a man of prayer  --  and resolving that he would jot it down as part of the record for future historians just in case the Lady Deirdre missed it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . The jungle looked impenetrable . Even so , the briefing officer chose it over the desert , which was supposedly dominated by aborigines ; as interesting as those original Zylongi might be , they were not the primary object of his mission . Podraig , Iona 's foul-tongued computer , had refused to advise about the landing . To set down on the plain outside  | what seemed to be their capital might be seen as a warlike invasion ; the Dev might be blasted out of the air before it touched ground , and Seamus with it , worse luck for him . " Do they have the weapons to blast anything out of the air ? " Seamus had asked the computer . " No frigging data , " snarled Podraig . On the other hand , if he landed in the desert or the jungle at some distance from the capital , they might not even notice him . Or if they did , they might not think it worth the effort to rescue him . Maybe they were a race of mystics , like some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect us all . So with the computer refusing to make estimates , the decision was to drop him in the jungle . Better to be marooned in the jungle with plenty of water and food  --  all of which might be poison  --  than to be blasted out of the air or die of thirst on the desert . " Why not put me down on one of the mountains ? " Seamus had demanded ironically . " They say freezing to death is a pleasant way to die once you get used to it . " No one had bothered to laugh . Anyway , here he was in the jungle . Did the locals know he was here ? Did they care ? Did they have any intention of rescuing him from this fragrant , hellishly hot landing site ? He had nothing but a harp to ward off any animals that might lurk there . In the briefing the monk Kiernan  --  Kiernan Pat , the one with the Ph.D . in biology , as distinct from Kiernan Tim , the subnavigator  --  had said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are herds of cattle , which the dominant race  --  vegetarians , you see  --  keep for their milk and fur .... " " Fur . . . cattle with fur ? " Seamus protested . " Heathenish , is n't it ? The subordinate race are omnivorous and consume small animals , so there 's probably a predatory food chain . There is no reason , of course , to assume that there is an absence of large predators . I 'd be in- terested , " he smiled faintly , " to learn that any of them were hominivorous . " " You mean man-eating ? " " That 's right . " " I 'll try to let you know , Kiernan , me boy . " " You do that , Seamus . " Seamus sat down in the shadow of the Dev and peeled back the top of his poet 's gown . Strumming his harp , he crooned an ancient and mournful Celtic melody , adapted to fit his situation . It went on  --  interminably , he himself was willing to admit  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone off to a strange world to spy on the enemy . If the Zylongi had sound-scanners focused on him , they knew he was a minstrel  --  that is , if their culture had any sense of such a person . And if they had the good taste to enjoy his music . Do they even have music here ? All rational life forms have music , the teacher had insisted in the monastery school 's class in xenology . How do we know ? Seamus had demanded . Well , he had not been designed to be a scholar anyway . " You 're not stupid at all , at all , Seamus Finnbar O'Neill , " the Lady Deirdre had said with some sympathy . " It 's just that your talents are not in the scholarly direction . " " Not anywhere near it , " he admitted ruefully . " I find it hard to concentrate in a classroom ... . " " Especially when there are young women present . " " Well , " he admitted with a winning smile , " they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd be thinking about them even if they were n't there . " " It might even be worse , " he agreed . " You 'll be the death of me yet , " she had sighed . " You 're a terrible cross for an old woman to bear . " Seamus had refrained from denying that she was old .  | His instincts said that her displeasure over his grades was not to be turned away by compliments  --  even accurate ones . Seamus had no objection to accurate flattery , but he never considered his creativity to be limited by accuracy  --  espedaily when women were the issue . The Captain Abbess 's comment on his intelligence was motivated by a mistake he had made in one of the planning sessions for this mission . She had been giving the standard lecture about the origins of space exploration . In the middle of the twenty-first century , it was said , the abundance of cheap energy , combined with a long period of tranquillity on Earth , had produced the Second Great Exploration , during which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ideology or in search of a better world . Seamus had been daydreaming about the glorious swelling ; breasts of his " proper " woman . He felt he ought to say something to indicate that he was listening . " Columbus and Leif and Brendan and them fellas , and them all being Irish too .. . " Herself was quite upset . " No , that was the First Exploration , a thousand years and more before the settlement of Tara . " Our Holy Order exists , " she said icily , " to keep alive the Spirit of Exploration that brought our forebears to Tara no long ago . " " ' T is true , " Seamus had said , as though giving the woman good grades on her historical knowledge . The Tarans wanted to keep alive the era of adventure , and the Zylongi , apparently , wanted to forget all about it . While he sang of the lamentations of his unfortunately imaginary lover , O'Neill considered his chances . Carmody , a Brigadier serving as the Iona 's Operations Officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this reconnaissance . The Zylongi were far below normal on the aggression scale ; they would probe , find him harmless , and release him . " Will they now ? " O'Neill strummed a chord on his harp  | that was supposed to indicate irony . " Would you care to offer an estimate of the probability of such a happy outcome ? " Carmody , shrugging his massive shoulders , a frown crossing his craggy face , muttered , " Between sixty and seventy-five percent . " O'Neill laughed out loud . Fitzgerald , Carmody , even the sainted Podraig were guessing . A lavender twilight was descending , and with it a powerfully sweet , enticing smell , one which brought back all of his virtuously dismissed fantasies . It would be a good place to bring the proper woman on a proper honeymoon . Sure would n't the smell turn her on too ? His daydreams returned to the issue of her breasts , a subject on which Seamus had a tolerant and open mind , so many different arrangements were there that might prove satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back to Tara , where you 've never been yourself , and maybe on the Green Hills impregnate her there , and then you go on to Earth and your child is born in the Old Ground or on the shore of the Great Lake . ' T would be a fine honeymoon and religious pilgrimage all combined into one . He made the sign of the cross reverently . Sure there 'd be nothing wrong after you 're married with mixing lovemaking and praying . With the Transit stations developed half a millennium ago , Tara was only two weeks from Earth . If ever the components of such a station , long stored in the hold of the Iona , were assembled here on Zylong , it would be only a little more than two months from Zylong to Earth , and the Transit circuits were not crowded in this era between Explorations ? save of course for Tarans , who were incorrigible travelers and pilgrims . The Holy Rule said that no pilgrim could return to Tara or to Earth , unless his monastery had found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your home , but you could visit previous homes for reasonable times , " so long as the purpose is educational and religious . " Sure that was all I had in mind . Education and religion .  | The pilgrim ships were wisely forbidden contact with the planet they had left behind , save for purposes of canonical obligations ( like the Captain Abbess 's participation in Roman elections ) . Zylong was , of course , even more isolated because , except for an occasional wandering space tramp , it had no contact with the world its founders had left behind for a millennium , by their choice at that . They wanted no part , the Abbess said with a twist of distaste in her aristocratic mouth , of the " corruption " of earth . She was not exactly naive about human nature , but as she added , " Seamus , corruption comes with the genes and not with the place . Is n't that true ? " He had agreed , of course , though he did not know either Earth or Tara . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pictures . To visit the Old Worlds with your proper woman would be almost as much fun as making love with the proper woman . He was so pleasantly occupied with his daydreams that he almost missed the Zylongi patrol . They crept stealthily through the jungle , like the pack of heathen savages they probably were . O'Neill read their presence before he heard them . His rather dull psychic sense  --  dull compared to the real experts like herself , anyway  --  felt five " persons , " anxious but not hostile . That foulmouthed computer , Podraig , insisted that they would be humanoid . " Somewhat different from us in their biology after a thousand years and more , " Commodore Fitzgerald said at his briefing , " probably not so different as to exclude crossbreeding , " adding , with a faint touch of irony , " not that you need feel obliged to make any experiments in that direction . " " Persons " probably meant humanoid . And as for breeding , all thought of anything related to that praiseworthy and perennial process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . I 'm not an anthropologist , I 'm not an explorer . I 'm a soldier and a second-rate bard . What the hell am I doing here ?  | And you 're just as dead if you 're ' killed by " anxious " folk instead of " hostile " folk . Then the Zylongi slipped out of the jungle . Seamus lost some of his fear . They did n't look all that scary . In fact , they looked almost as frightened of him as he was of them . " Sure is n't that always the way , " he spoke his profound wisdom aloud . " Everyone is scared of everyone else . " The Zylongi stopped in their tracks at the sound of his voice , as though his words had frozen them in place . There were three men and two women . Shorter than Tarans , with darker skin , brown hair , European faces , the Zylongi showed their Earth origins . Four of them carried spears ; one of the men had a rather ancient carbine-type weapon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lovely  --  short and full-figured like vestpocket Venuses . Their dark arms and shoulders invited a caress despite the wicked spears they carried . One was a little older than the other , a dusting of gray in her curly brown hair . Well , they do n't know what to make of my voice . What will they think of my music ? He reached for the harp . The man with his weapon raised it warningly . Seamus struck a chord . The fellow lowered the weapon  --  a little . Mostly to offend the Lady Deirdre , whom he was sure was listening , he devoted his long song to highly clinical praise of the women and their attributes , which would have made them proper bed partners indeed . The Zylongi listened , their faces still blank and wary , but their bodies relaxing as the melody went on . Sure they know it 's sensual music and they ca n't help but like it . Good thing for me they do n't know exactly what I 'm suggesting might be done with those wee lasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be in charge spoke , softly but as though giving an order . The younger woman walked gingerly toward him , touched his harp , and when she realized that he would not resist ,  | gently took it out of his hand . She strummed its strings with a nervous smile . O'Neill patted her approvingly on her head . Well , they know about music , O'Neill thought . There was nothing about the men 's slender , smooth bodies to suggest they would be particularly competent in a brawl . They were handsome in a diminutive sort of way ? much like Taran boys in their early teens . I could lick a dozen of them without working up a sweat . I could disarm this crowd in a couple of seconds . Knock out the men and carry off the girls . They 'd probably come willingly enough . They seem fascinated by my six feet four and red beard . Seamus O'Neill , you 're an idjit for even thinking such things . Well , it 's all right to think about them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rules say you do n't exploit the locals sexually or any other way . And God knows , Seamus O'Neill , you 've always been one to keep the Rules . All of his captors were clad in wraparound , turquoisecolored kilts with markings that suggested they were uniforms . The men 's garments were fastened at the waist ; the women 's under their arms . Despite the heat and humidity , the light fabric showed , no sign of wilt or wrinkle . There ought to be no trouble removing such garments , if it ever came to that . Hey , Seamus O'Neill , what about the Rules ? I 'm only thinking those things because I have no idea how to be a spy . A man is entitled to calm his nerves , is n't he ? The local with the gun approached the captive and began speaking in a soft musical language . O'Neill was reluctant to reach for his universal translator with a spear point just an inch from his bare chest . He kept his hands high and smiled in what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched his red beard . Do n't they have such things here ? In a sharp tone the armed man spoke directly to her . She blushed , pulled her hand back quickly , lowered her eyes , and murmured what sounded like an apology to Seamus.  | " ' T is no problem at all , at all , " Seamus said soothingly . " Sure , even Taran women like red-bearded men . " The girl blushed more deeply . Is n't it remarkable now , how much you can convey by a tone of voice . Seamus began to relax . The police patrol probably had orders to bring him in alive if he did n't seem hostile . ( Carmody 's prediction had suggested this . ) They hesitated . The man with the gun gave an order and the older woman set down her spear . There were a lot of fancy gold stripes at the top of her uniform , which did n't hurt the view of her full breasts at all , at all . Probably the insignia of some kind of senior medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was used to giving orders and being obeyed . She took from a pocket in her wrap something that looked suspiciously like a syringe . The police doctor , thought O'Neill slowly and carefully , for the benefit of the readers on Iona , must have been ordered to put me under . The woman approached O'Neill slowly , apprehensively , a gauzelike pad in one hand , the needle in the other . The others moved a step closer , their spears poised , ready to strike . Her head came barely to his chest , her deep brown eyes looked up into his blue ones . She seemed to plead with him not to hurt her . O'Neill felt a wrench of desire . His heart went out gently toward her fear . For a moment their eyes locked . She looked away quickly . Then resolutely she looked up at him again . Her brown eyes , deep , dark , and inviting , were even more frightened . O'Neill had always been a sucker for terrified women . She 's probably old enough to be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wrinkles on her pretty face , touches of fleshpads on her neck and chin . She was , however , very nicely built and poignantly attractive . " Do n't be afraid of me . " O'Neill touched her cheek . " I 'm not going to hurt you , and unless our biologies are more unlike than they seem , whatever you have in that great terrible needle is n't going to hurt me much either . "  | She lowered the needle and waited , as though submitting , not at all unwillingly , to a heathen greeting ritual . " I 'm not the heathen . " Seamus laughed . " You are . " She laughed lightly too , probably assuming that was part of the ritual . It was a pleasant face to touch , warm and smooth . Almost without realizing what he was doing , Seamus caressed it lightly , first with his fingers and then with his whole hand . The woman seemed to sag , as though she were yielding to him completely . Seamus glanced around . The others did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent fascination . So , because it could n't possibly do any harm , he kissed her forehead . The woman tensed in surprise but did not try to fend him off . Her friends gasped . More in astonishment than in outrage , he thought . " Keep your hands off the women , Seamus , " the Captain Abbess had said , " and yourself with more than enough of the chemicals of the young in you . " Well , she did n't forbid a little ritual kiss at the beginning , did she ? Besides , what kind of a Taran bard would it be that did n't brush his lips against hers ? His kiss was quick , and her startled lips were firm and warm . Her eyes widened , her jaw dropped , and her head tilted down . Seamus noted with interest that firm nipples were pressing against the fabric of her uniform . Ah , now , it was n't that much of a kiss . But then , you 've never been kissed by a red-bearded giant before . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy than anything else . See , Your Ladyship , I am skilled at this spy business after all . The kissing is n't really to calm my fears . Sure I 'm not afraid at all , at all . Well , not as afraid as this poor thing is . Hesitantly , the woman lifted the syringe and nodded at it , as if asking his permission . " No problem at all , at all . " Seamus took her hand and guided it toward his arm . She was trembling ; he felt her  | pulse racing through her arm and imagined her heart beating rapidly . " Nothing to be afraid of . " He rolled the gown off his shoulder and pointed at his upper arm muscle . " Is it here you 're wanting to stick me ? " She nodded dubiously , still not sure that he would n't break her back . He thought about kissing her again but , instead , drew her hand to its target . He hardly felt the needle when it plunged into his arm . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . As his limbs began to weaken , he wondered vaguely whether the programming the geniuses on the Iona had built into him would resist probes for lust . It wo n't do to have the Zylongi know how you reacted to one of their mature police medical types . They might not approve at all of such exchanges . Still , they did n't object too strongly . Maybe they do n't object to a few minor exchanges of affection now and then with weird outworld giants . Even if he 's the first weird outworld giant they 've ever seen . O'Neill felt very peaceful and very sleepy . He began to slide toward the ground . The medical woman threw her arms around him and shouted . The others raced to help her . Very gently they lowered him to the turf that he had so recently claimed , albeit tentatively and subject to approval by the locals , for the pilgrimage of the Iona . Everything 's gone according to plan so far . Is n't that nice . His second-to-last thought was not of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Holy Captain Abbess Deirdre Cardinal Fitzgerald . His last thought was that it had suddenly turned very dark . Ritual kiss or not , the woman doctor tried to kill me.  | " Commandant O'Neill , reporting for final instructions , Your Ladyship , ma'am , " he said , saluting sloppily , his tone containing just enough servile respect to stop a half-step short of insolence . This time the black-haired witch was going to have to tell him the whole truth , not the half-truths that she liked as a matter of political principle even when expediency did not demand that she be evasive . The Cardinal took her hand off the quartz rock that transmitted psychic impulses to the huge viewing screen on the oak-paneled wall of her throne room . Zylong faded away ; thick red curtains fell back to cover the screen . The matching observation port remained open , revealing the cold stars staring implacably from the darkness of eternal night . O'Neill , who did not like darkness , shivered slightly and turned away from the port . " Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in . " There was always a faint twinkle in her eyes when he entered . Seamus knew that he was half a son to her , a replacement for her own slaughtered children . It made for an awkward relationship , especially since neither of them would ever dare mention it . On the other hand , it never hurt to know that the Cardinal Abbess had a soft place in her heart for you . " Having a look at our friends down there ? " he asked with elaborate casualness . Sorting through papers , she began to read a summary : " This report , Seamus , has been compiled basically from four sources : ( a ) reports from the occasional traveler who landed on Zylong , usually by mistake , and lived to tell about it ; ( b ) 17  | estimations from what we know of communitarian utopian societies of similar perfectionist bent ; ( c ) our own physical scanning  --  which they do not seem to have intercepted , by the way ; and finally ( d ) our psychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than completely satisfactory at this distance . Clear ? " " ' T is , " he said curtly . " I will , " she shuffled through the papers , " have some comments of my own after I summarize the data . All right ? " " Sure you do n't often sound like a social scientist . " " I use the jargon whenever it seems appropriate , " she colored slightly , indicating that in the endless sparring that was essential to Taran culture , he had scored a point . but had hardly won the battle , much less the war . " It is , in all likelihood , an old utopian culture entering its last phases before disintegration . The communitarian zeal that once animated it is long since spent . The pretense of unanimous shared decision-making will have long since turned into an empty ritual . It will be very civilized , very sophisticated , very gentle and polite as long as no one challenges the basic assumptions or the real power structure ? and make no mistake about it , Seamus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if unacknowledged power structure from the very beginning . " " ' Course we do n't know what happens to one after a thousand years , now do we ? " " An intelligent observation ? " she raised a thin eyebrow " ? as welcome as it is rare . In any case , they will be very supportive of one another , but that very support will be a form of social control . There will be little personal freedom as we know it and very little creative vitality . " " Not exactly like us , " Seamus said with a grin . The Abbess did not find it amusing . " There could hardly be greater differences between them and the band of halfmad , individualistic anarchists over which I seem to be destined to be responsible . " Her slender fingers drummed  | thoughtfully on the desk . " We are contentious , troublesome , independent , given to decisions by a handful of votes .... " " Except for reelecting yourself every year . " " ... That does not alter the point , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pace , " that we are neither polite , nor cultivated , nor civilized and that we not only permit individual creativity to the point of eccentricity ? as you yourself exemplify ? " she smiled , rather like an amused parent with an indulged child , " ? we actively encourage it . We are , in fact , rather proud of our oddities and our eccentricities . " " Ah , sure we 're at least alive . " " We are that , Seamus Finnbar O'Neill . Our manners and our morals may not have improved much since the days of the Proto-Celts on Tara . We drink too much , we argue too much , we talk too much , we fight too much .... " " On occasion , begging Your Ladyship 's pardon , we wench too much . " The Cardinal frowned . " That is neither here nor there . Our men are often rather timid in these matters ; they talk a much better game than they actually play , or do I cut too close to the bone , Seamus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to that . So the Cardinal , pleased that she had scored a point , continued . " Our relations between the sexes are usually marked by interminable verbal sparring . " " ' T is not true at all , at all . " Seamus grinned genially at her . " Pure calumny . " " We daydream too much and justify it in the name of mysticism . We pray a lot but mostly because we think God is a Gael like we are . We take interminable showers and baths  --  in the water all the time  --  and make a fetish out of personal hygiene and at the same time are incorrigibly sloppy in our domestic hygiene . Have you ever seen anything in all the galaxy as sloppy as this vessel ? And despite my endless efforts to keep it neat and clean ? "  | " It works . " Seamus raised his hands in excuse . " Well , perhaps not much longer . Now where was 1 ? Oh yes , we are very good at hating and not very good at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we 're happy . We laugh and drink and make love at wakes and cry and drink and often do n't make love at weddings .... " " A terrible lot altogether .... " " Well ? " she straightened her alloy-stiff back a little more " ? until you consider the alternatives . In any case the culture contact between deteriorating utopian communalism ... " She shuffled through her papers . " I believe that is what our scholars call it , yes . Impressive words , are n't they , Seamus Finnbar O'Neill ? ... between , as I say , deteriorating communalism , and incorrigible  --  let me see , yes  --  anarchic individualism can be fraught with problems . " " Anarchic individualists ? Is that what we are ? Well , it seems reasonable enough . Sure I like us better . " " Precisely . But our friends down there might be forgiven for reacting as our ancestors did to the arrival of the Vikings . In almost any scenario , there could be serious trouble . " " We 're not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foam chair . " Sure wo n't we leave them alone ? " " Not going to do them any harm ? " She fingered her ivory pectoral cross nervously . " That 's what the early missionaries on Tara said when unwittingly they brought contagious diseases that killed most of the locals off . We can cope with the medical problems well enough now . But our approach to life could be as deadly to them . Could you imagine , to cite a minor point , a Zylongi woman trying to deal with the endless stream of blarney that pours from the mouth of a Taran male ? " " Or a Zylongi male trying to sort out which of the thousand ways a Taran female says ' no ' actually mean ' yes ' ? " " That is neither here nor there . " Her tough jaw set in  | its usual hard line , an indication that someone had scored a point against her . Turnabout was never fair play with Cardinal Fitzgerald . Sauce for the goose , never sauce for the gander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject the truth of Seamus 's observation . " To take a much more serious matter , what might happen in a culture in which political democracy  --  as we know it , anyway ? has not existed for centuries when it faces a culture in which politics is the favorite form of daytime entertain-ment ? ? " " And often nighttime too . " She ignored him completely . " ? A culture in which discontent is almost never expressed when it encounters one in which it is celebrated almost daily , as routinely as we monks chant the divine office ? " " I begin to see the problem . " Seamus leaned forward on his chair . " And the difficulty from their point of view is that , if our estimates are right , their culture has lost its drive . And ours , as far as we can tell anyway , has as much drive as it ever had . " " There are disadvantages in anarchy , as I of all people on this untidy , disorderly , contentious ship have reason to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their culture seems to be in acute trouble . Either it will be running down like a clock that can not be rewound or it will have built up enormous energies of frustration that are ready to explode . Podraig thinks there is a fifty  --  fifty chance of violent disintegration within the year . Arguably both processes will be occurring . " " Will any of them know it ? " " Most will deny it ? " she glanced at the blank screen " ? but some of the more intelligent or the more lunatic will know it , of course . That will make the situation there very volatile , however serene and untroubled the veneer may appear . " " So with that kind of error margin , you need a human spy to second-guess that cheap thief of a computer ? " he  | asked , sitting himself across from her without waiting to be asked . The Lady Deirdre Fitzgerald sighed . " You know well , Seamus O'Neill , that you are under no obligation to go on this mission . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had caused , by a mental wish , to appear on the small viewing screen . " Seamus , that may be the end of our pilgrimage . God knows , it is time to end it . You and I know more than most the costs that have been paid for it . We can not afford another disaster . " There was silence in the heavily draped room . The Captain Abbess rearranged her plain brown robe , not the elaborate Celtic dress blue used on solemn high occasions , with its thin red fringe and the blue Brigid 's cross . She was thinking of her husband and children , O'Neill knew . And he thought of his parents , slain ten years ago in the disastrous landing on Rigoon . None of the other pilgrimages , not even the fateful trip of the Clonmacnoise , had been so long or so tragic . He did n't want to talk about it . " Moreover , as you are well aware , there is a faction within the monastery which thinks that it is time to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his chair , ready to battle with anyone who challenged Her Ladyship 's wisdom and leadership . " You 're the idjit too . " She pointed at the chair . " Restrain your temper and sit down . This matter is too serious for a display of your masculine pride . " She readjusted her ivory cross and tucked a few strands of errant hair back under her veil . " Their dissatisfaction is understandable . We are , after all , in serious trouble . Yet if we become colonists instead of missionaries , convert makers instead of respectful visitors who come peacefully in response to invitation , then there will be violence and death . We may win at first , but in the long run we will lose just as surely and far more dreadfully than we will if we let this monastery become a lifeless space derelict . "  | " And you 'll have no part of leading an invasion . " " I will not . " She rested her hand gently on the desk in front of her , as determined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . If it comes to that , they 'll invade by themselves . " " Shush , Seamus . " She sighed wearily . " It has not come to that yet . Mostly now it is talk . Yet I can not be wholly displeased with mothers and fathers who do not want to see their children die slowly and painfully as we run out of food and air and water . The talk of mutiny is not dangerous , not yet . " " So I am to pop in and find out if the Zylongi would allow a monastery of the Order of Saints Brendan and Brigid to land on an island in their great big river . " He hoped his light tone would dispel the unhappy memories that haunted both of them . The Captain Abbess played with the ruby on her finger . " As you know , Seamus , ours is not a missionary order . The Peregrinatio is an act of devotion and service in itself , needing no other justification . We convert no one to our Holy Faith by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iona , our monasteries have been devoted to scholarship and prayer . If the example of our lives of joy , learning , and service attract people to the Holy Faith , then well and good . We are not out to make converts . " It was the official party line . Deirdre repeated it as though reciting a lesson . Seamus knew she believed it ; he believed it himself , more or less , and certainly his parents before him had believed it . Why else would a young couple have embarked on this crazy pilgrimage ? " But , " Seamus added , with a faint touch of sarcasm , fleshing out the official version , " since there is a little bit of the gombeen man in all of us , we have the custom of ending our pilgrimages only when we find a planet where there is a good chance the natives will be attracted by something more than the quality of our poteen . If Podraig is right , the Zylongi are going to need someone to pick up  | the pieces for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her into a corner where she would have to trot out the whole truth . Deirdre ignored his sarcasm . Fingering the sheaf of papers on her desk , she spoke : " You will remember that my sainted predecessor thought we would be received with open arms on Rigoon . It was only Carmody and the last company of Wild Geese that saved us all from extinction . " O'Neill remembered all right . A fourteen-year-old boy with a bloody pike in his hand , looking down at the mutilated bodies of his family , would not ever forget Rigoon or the sainted fool who led them into the trap . " So I am to observe how far along the line toward collapse the Zylongi are ? " " Something like that , Seamus O'Neill . " She sighed again and found on one of her summary papers something to hold her eyes . She wo n't look at me , damn her . It was time for Seamus to raise his real objection . " Why not just leave them alone ? If the Zylongi have a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do they care that they 're not free ? " Rising from her throne , the Captain walked over to the viewer . " You 've only known freedom , Seamus O'Neill . You can not imagine life without it . " She was n't letting him look at her melancholy eyes . " We will not harm the Zylongi . You know me well enough to know that I will not take away anyone 's happiness or contentment . I trust you on this mission ; you must trust whatever decisions I have to make . " Whatever was on Deirdre 's mind , it was making her sad and weary . Still , O'Neill knew it would come to that . The whole crew of the Iona worshiped the woman . Each year when she came up for reelection the vote was overwhelming . Even those who were muttering about a vote to change the Rules assumed  --  irrationally , it seemed to Seamus  --  that she would accept such a change . If the ill-starred pilgrimage of  | the Iona was ever to end happily , the Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the fact that she read the whole monastery , perceiving problems even before they arose , did n't hurt . He had seen Deirdre turn aside a large meteor when the safety shields were not functioning . " There is , " Liam Carmody said once , " just a little bit of the witch about 1 Ier Ladyship . " It was not unusual for a woman to captain a spacecraft . I Ioly Brigid herself had presided over a monastery of monks and virgins long ago . Of course , the Captain Abbess was not a virgin ; she had been married with three children before the disaster at Rigoon . If rumors were to be believed , she was not exactly pious in her youthful days on Tara before the pilgrimage . After Rigoon and the loss of her family , she chose to leave the Wild Geese and to join the monastic community in order to erase the great wound in her heart . She grew in wisdom and political skill , as well as piety , without losing the strength of her youth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Abbot 's throne on the bridge of Iona . She was neither young nor old but timeless beneath her veil , her long black hair covered now ; the delicate face looking out clear-eyed and farseeing over a world she was already beyond . Trust Deirdre ? The monks and the Wild Geese might complain mightily  --  that was part of being a Taran  --  but the pale , melancholy Abbess had absolute command of their fidelity . One did not , of course , imagine the Abbess without her monastic robes . But she did swim in the Iona 's pool like everyone else  --  in a brown swimsuit with a crimson fringe ? and one could hardly help notice that her figure was still , to put it mildly , presentable . That , however , was never discussed and certainly was far from anyone 's mind when they were in her throne room . Well , reasonably far . Her sigh captured O'Neill 's straying attention . He stood  | up and drew himself to his full height . " Woman , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There is , of course , the matter of the aborigines , " she said , gazing thoughtfully at the map , " creatures who were there before the Zylongi migrated to the planet . There are hints in the few reports we have from travelers that there is something unusual either about the aborigines themselves or with the Zylongi 's relations with them . " " So that 's another one of my jobs . I 'm to keep an eye out for the aborigines . But rumors from space tramps are not enough to make you frown that way , Lady Deirdre . " Get to it , woman , stop beating around the bush . You 'll drive me daft . " How perceptive of you to notice . " She sighed wearily , rose gracefully from her throne , and wandered over to the observation port . " Some of the early travelers made crude drawings of the aborigines . There 's one on the desk , as Podraig has reproduced it from his memory banks . Take a look at it , Seamus O'Neill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found a drawing of a creature that looked almost human . " Sure , ' t is like one of them cute little creatures in the biology textbooks . " He hesitated as he searched his memory for the right word . " Prehominid ? What are they doing here ? " " Precisely , Seamus Finnbar O'Neill . I do n't know the answer and I may never know it . Removed from Earth aeons ago by a Great Exploration from elsewhere of which we know nothing ? Perhaps . Evolving at a slower rate here because of a different set of environmental challenges ? Maybe . " " Brigid , Patrick , and Columcile ! " " Precisely . " She touched a button on the wall , and the thick damask curtains soundlessly closed over the observation port , much to Seamus 's relief . " And all the other holy saints . Therefore , there is a reasonable possibility that the  | so-called dominant race has interfered with the evolutionary process of this species , which is in all likelihood conspecific with us and them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my gut instinct , Seamus . " She placed a hand briefly on an admirably flat belly . " Where you find domination of conspecifics , you encounter sexual exploitation . A shortage of women , powerful men displaying their might with harems , organized prostitution . The races mix . Then the superior race , horrified at what it has done , denies the past , which means they deny the conspecific nature of the subordinate race . The result is even more cruel violation , exploitation , degradation  --  if necessary , of millions of creatures . Do you understand ? " " As yourself has said , even the Tarans are bigots . " " Even . " She smiled wryly . " At least we know it . " She walked back to her throne and sat down in it , as elegantly as she had risen . " You even say that the bigot distorts himself more than he does the target of his bigotry . " She smiled indulgently . " You do have a brain , do n't you , Seamus Finnbar O'Neill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed her report away impatiently " ? I would bet , if it were permitted an Abbess to gamble the few jewels left on this ship , that the dominant race has done terrible things to itself and to the other race in the name of its supposed superiority . " " Whose side are we on ? The poor little creatures , I hope . " " Everyone 's ! " she snapped impatiently . " We try to make peace , not choose sides in conflict . You know that . " " Ay , " he agreed solemnly . " It just takes me a little time to remember the right Rule . " The Captain leaned back on her throne and said very softly , " We ca n't be precise , Seamus . We ca n't lock onto it . There is something bizarre about Zylong that does n't fit our expectations . The culture is so different we ca n't process  | it . That 's why we need a transceiver .... " t ler voice trailed off . " You mean a psychic bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded . " What makes you so sure ? " Now the deep blue eyes locked in on him . Somewhere in Podraig 's memory banks was a notation doubtless dating back to childhood . Seamus O'Neill was low in psychic perception powers but had abilities to transmit psychic energy to others . He was being dispatched to Zylong to soak up vibrations and send them back to others to interpret . Damn the woman ! Still , there was more coming , those eyes were not ready to let him go . With resignation he slipped back into his chair . " You 'd better tell me all the bad news . " " Zylong may be the final planet . " She put her hand on his shoulder . " Those who speak about changing the Rules do not really understand how bad our situation is . If they knew , their talk would be more insistent . We might well have a mutiny on our hands . " " The final planet ? What do you mean , woman ? The cosmos is filled with planets . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Seamus , I mean the final planet for us . The Iona is tired and old . It does n't work as well as it used to . Ours has been the longest Taran pilgrimage ; we do n't know how long these ships can last . My own guess is that we 'll be lucky to last another year or two without incapacitating trouble . " O'Neill was grimly silent for a moment . " Well , morale is still pretty good , " he argued lamely . " Despite the complaints . " " Is it , Seamus ? We Celts are a blend of fatalism and hope  --  that 's why we go on pilgrimages . When the hope wanes , " she sighed , " you have only paralyzing melancholy left . There are a few incorrigible hopers like yourself ? " she smiled at him gently " ? but melancholy is increasing on this ship . There 's nothing we can do about it . How many mar- riages have there been among the young Wild Geese ? I realize it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kavanaugh 's choice . " " You mean it 's like after the Great Famine on Earth ? People just do n't have enough hope to begin new fami-lies ? " Another sigh . " Too many failures , too many frustrations , too many defeats , Seamus , even for a crew of Tarans . " She spoke slowly , heavily , as though she bore the weight of all the sorrows of the pilgrimage . " If we do n't land ? . . . " O'Neill asked . Damn it , of course I 'll go . Why does she have to be so indirect about telling me the truth ? Cardinal Deirdre smiled . " Then it was not to be , and it has been an interesting if overlong pilgrimage . " She dismissed him with a wave . " Now , Seamus O'Neill , off with you . While I am not normally greatly pleased at anything , I would be pleased if you are able to send back good news . " It was arranged . Connor McNulty , the monk psychologist , prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zylongi as a harmless and hungry space minstrel . It was a role close enough to what he actually was so that , as McNulty observed , there was an eighty percent probability that the Zylongi probes would not break through the cover . The cover also portrayed O'Neill as having studied anthropology at the university in Tara before being expelled for drinking too much . ( " Which of us does n't ? " said O'Neill . ) The Prior sang the farewell Mass . It was a nice touch . Had they never expected to see him again , the Abbess herself would have participated in his " last rites . " If they thought he had a good chance , the Subprior would have celebrated ; as it was , the Prior 's Mass signaled that Seamus O'Neill 's chances were neither bad nor good . " Well , I suppose I had better get your blessing before I go , " he said gruffly to the Captain Abbess after Mass and  | just before debarkation . " Sure it ca n't hurt . " I k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her abbatial ring . She took his head in her hands . " Go with God , Seamus O'Neill . Come back to us just as you are now . " It was her most solemn benedictory tone . The peace that was reputed to be in the hands of an Abbot flowed through his person . Then Seamus Finnbar O'Neill 's whole being was filled with joy and light and the warmth of overpowering love . Sure it did n't seem right that a holy Abbess herself should feel such love for him . Still , what was wrong with it ? She was human and she was a woman and he was kind of a son to her anyway . Besides , he loved her too . Like a son . Mostly . He was jarred to notice that as she made the sign of the cross over him , she was weeping . The Captain Abbess was not known for sentimentality . His confidence went down considerably at the thought of the Abbess already keening for him . Tears rose in his own eyes . Hennessey , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in front of the pressure chamber that led to the tiny spacecraft . Ah , well , your best friend marries your girl on you and they both come to see you off . He shook Fergus 's hand and hugged Tessie , saying , " Sure , woman , you made the right choice . Never a doubt about that . " As he walked down the long ramp of the pressure chamber to his ship , O'Neill thought that Tessie probably had indeed made the right choice . No one would send the sentimental Hennessey off on such a wild mission . He strode by the great troop carriers Kevin Barry , Thomas Patrick Doherty , and Daniel P. Moynihan , past his beloved training ship Napper Tandy , the abbot 's shuttle Michael Collins , the gunships Bernardette Devlin , Eamon Casey , and John F. Kennedy to the very end of the ramp , where his battered Eamon De Valera was docked . It was allegedly a craft with interstellar capabilities ; in fact , it was a cranky , unpredictable tub as expendable as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monastery  | bells chiming vespers as he clanked the door of the Dev shut . Just before he pressed the signal to launch , Podraig , in the mindless singsong of a computer , intoned , " God go with you , Seamus O'Neill . " He replied by raising a number of pointed and profane questions about Podraig 's ancestry , slamming off the communications input before the blatherskite had a chance to reply .  | From a great depth O'Neill clawed his way back to consciousness . The Zylongi were bumping and jolting him down a jungle path . They had misjudged the dosage necessary to put him out . He almost wished he were unconscious ; he was hot , sweaty , thirsty . The rough ride gave him a headache . Resolutely he kept his eyes closed and began to " read " the environment for the damn crowd up there in herself 's throne room  --  bad luck to the lot of them . With considerable effort and many brisk commands and gentle tugs from the medical woman , they got him into a small hovercraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide body of water  --  a lake or a great river , he could n't tell which . Apparently his head was resting in her lap , a position that was intellectually consoling but in his present condition not much else . The jungle was teeming with animal life : Kiernan 's food chain . There were a lot of little critters , quite unrecognizable to Seamus . But among them were massive bears , some suspicious-looking medium-sized dinosaurs , a flock of mastodons , and some wandering cats that seemed to be exactly like the pictures Seamus had seen of saber-toothed tigers . Just like someone has scooped up creatures from Earth long ago , deposited them here , and then forgot about them . Seamus had the impression that there were degrees of jungle and that the wilder critters were way off in the distance . He also noted that his captors were scared stiff of the place and in a hurry to get out of it . Then they cut across an intensely cultivated plain , in parts of which , sure enough , there were vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a culture whose sagas dealt with cattle raids , Seamus was affronted by the furry cattle , but he was too sick and too uncomfortable to take much pleasure in being affronted . There were only two or three kinds of crops , presided over by robots and human technicians , with other humans ? well , kind of humans  --  running errands for the technicians . An old and highly sophisticated system of agriculture it seemed . Then closer to the City he " saw " wagon trains , long processions of large carts being drawn by animals that looked like squat ungainly horses . These trains streamed back and forth across the plain , bringing in supplies of raw materials , stuff that looked like metal ore and lumber , and tracking back empty for more supplies . As they drew closer to the City , they met mechanical movers , heavy , slow , and clumsy , and an occasional rapid scooter like the hovercraft they were in . The City itself loomed up in the distance , a giant manufacturing and commercial center , the throbbing core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses , a curiously lifeless place , seemingly with less human energy than the comparatively tiny Iona . The planet was laid out pretty much the way the chart on the Lady Deirdre 's desk said it should be : a single world island in the Northern Hemisphere  --  tundra on the very top , trailing off into steppes , and then the plains of which the City was the center . Beneath the City  --  as you looked down the island  --  was a massive snow-covered mountain spine with a rain forest on the left , on the fringe of which was Seamus 's landing site , and deserts on the right . The precipitation obviously came from the east . The City itself was on the bank of a meandering , sluggish river that originated in the mountains , flowed through the jungle , tumbled over a broad waterfall , and then flowed by the City into a vast delta land and then into the sea . Sure I 've spent my life on a titanium cylinder . I should be  | enjoying all these wondrous sights , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headache . Finally they landed on a platform at the edge of the City  --  a place so dazzling physically that , despite its lack of human vitality , it was beyond Seamus 's drowsy comprehension . I 'll come back for it later , he promised weakly . An armed guard helped to transfer O'Neill to a monorail car that moved him first across a grassy meadow , then along the riverbank  --  above the wide and slow-moving blue sheet ? and then into a deep dark tunnel , where O'Neill would have been perfectly willing to have left his consciousness if that had been possible . The medical woman was fussing over him anxiously , now , to tell the truth , bothering him with her chatter and solicitude . Ca n't you leave me in peace , woman ? Do n't you realize that I 'm a sick man ? Put my poor head on a pillow , would you please , and let me have a little bit of peace . Then the car arose from the tunnel and into the vast and splendid City , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue and green and lemon , looming on all sides . Despite his frigging headache , he read the City to be composed almost entirely of giant towers , forty and fifty stories high , made of a substance that was either rock or very hard metal , each one designed with a distinctive shape or rather in a series of distinctive patterns in which the shape of the building seemed to match the color in which it was painted . No , the colors were n't painted , they were somehow imprinted on the rock or metal . They were windowless and even though it was now well into the Zylongian night , they gleamed in an artificial light radiating up from the ground at their base . There was no sign of vegetation in the City . Between the buildings were huge plazas , boulevards , and wide esplanades of an elegant , formal checkerboard pattern  --  all swarming with handsome people clad in a dazzling variety of garments in the style of  | those the police wore , some reaching to the ankles and others , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seamus was too sick to notice whether the thighs of the young women were attractive . Dear God , he prayed , put me out completely . When I am no longer interested in female anatomy , I am too sick altogether , not long for this world , at all , at all . Well , almost too sick . It was his impression that the thighs and butts that were displayed were a bit too thick for his tastes , not that he was in any position at the moment to be choosy . In addition to the monorail on which he was now riding , O'Neill read tiny individual vehicles scurrying to and fro on the streets like multicolored bugs . There was also an extensive tunnel system into which the monorail plunged , though not , as far as he could see , the bugs . For someone like Seamus , born and bred on a spaceship , the City was dazzling , a glorious vista of civilized living , despite his monumental headache . A decayed culture it might be , but , since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the decay  --  a little . Just so long as it does n't change me much . And of course that could n't happen . The drug was beginning to wear off , and he reconsidered his wish that the medical woman leave him alone . If she insists on holding my hand and resting my head against her breasts , I 'll just have to accept that as part of the mission . So the culture 's degenerate . A little bit of degeneracy never hurt anyone . As he snuggled closer , still trying to act like a man in a trance , his monorail car plunged once more into a tunnel , deeper , it seemed , than before . Seamus thought he could sense running water , deep streams feeding into the vast river and perhaps providing the City with water . No engineering slouches , these folks . The woman was very comfortable indeed . There were undoubtedly others in the car with him . He sensed their presence . But it was dark . Ah , now , Seamus me boy , take things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unconscious . Then the car ascended to the surface and docked in front of a huge complex of towers , pale lime in color and , his psychic sense told him , bustling with human activity . His body must have somehow signaled his alertness . The woman 's firm breasts were , after all , a distraction and a torment . It was hard not to move just a little bit . They were , he realized , about to carry him into this complex . Then there was no chance to reflect further . He felt an instant of pain and then nothing at all . The Lord God had heard his prayers for oblivion . " Good morning , Poet O'Neill . You seem to be feeling better today . " The voice sounded as fragile as a tiny glass bell . He was lying on a contour couch in a windowless room illuminated by diffused light . It was much like the dentist 's quarters on the Iona and the woman looked much like a dental assistant in her soft white wrap with light blue jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who is this cool person looking down at me with such curiosity ? Am I dead ? Sure I ca n't be in hell because it does n't hurt . Maybe it 's heaven , but I do n't hear any harp music and this woman does n't look like an angel , though she 'll do till one comes along . " I 've felt worse , " he said , temporizing till he got the lay of the land . " A little weak to tell you the truth . " " That will pass quickly . " She smiled . " You are a very interesting patient . It took six of our orderlies to hold you down at one point . We 're ... " She hesitated . " I mean no offense , but we 're not used to someone of your size , Poet O'Neill . " My size , now what the hell does that mean ? " I hope I did n't hurt anyone . " " Only a few bruises . We must apologize for seeming to be rough . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a spaceship lands in our jungle . The First Ones  | taught us always to be courteous to guests . If we have been discourteous to you , we sincerely apologize . " Jungle ? What the hell ? Then he remembered . Zylong . They must have played their mind-probe games . Well , he was still alive so they had n't figured too much out . " I see you have me programmed to speak your language , " he said , feeling stupid as he spoke . Not very smooth for a master spy . " That was no great difficulty , Poet . Our tongues have common ancestors . Yours . . . let me see . . . " she consulted a clipboard " ... is related to Proto-English and Old Gaelic mixed with some unusual Teutonic features , while ours is of the Romance variety . We could have communicated without programming you if you had used the translator you carried on your belt . " O'Neill looked down . He was clad in a Zylongian kilt that matched the gray color of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  probably being analyzed by some electronics technician . Then he remembered the woman . The medical person . There were gold stripes on her white uniform , considerably more elaborate than her jungle dress , but still leaving little doubt about her attractions . The stripes spanned ample but neatly shaped breasts and then ran down her flanks , emphasizing , more than any Taran daytime fashion would have dared , the curves of her body . There was more gray in her hair than Seamus had realized , and more delicate lines at her throat . Still , she was more than adequate . Indeed , maybe even proper . I 've never been in love with an older woman before . It might be an interesting experience . Seamus O'Neill , get your mind off such things . You 're here to be a spy , not to be involved in ridiculous love affairs . Go ' long with you . Having love affairs is part of being a spy , is n't it ? Certainly your spies have a good time in all the books you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say no.  | She did n't say yes , either . And you know what the Rules say . Only if invited . But what if she invites - ne ? " I am sorry , " the woman went on , uneasily fingering her clipboard , " that we may have seemed to be unconscionably , ah , brutal with you . It was necessary or ... " she hesitated uneasily " . . . it was thought to be necessary . I trust you will accept my apologies , both official and personal . " " Well .. . Doctor ? " She nodded as though her title was unimportant . " My mother taught me never to make a false move with a spear pointed at my heart . " He tried his most roguish smile , but his lips barely parted . She laughed , revealing teeth that were slightly but prettily pointed . Carnivorous ancestors , indeed . Score one for the Lady Deirdre . " Poet O'Neill , we have very few visitors to Zylong . Three days ago there were mysterious energy forces at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who or what to expect . Some of our more superstitious people remembered an ancient legend about a red-bearded giant god who would come to destroy Zylong . Even we scientists were disconcerted by the image we received of you when you landed . Yes , I am a doctor . My name is Samaritha and I am Director of Biological Research at the Body Institute . " So , they had sent the big brass out for me , gorgeous brass at that . " I 'm happy to meet you officially , " he tried to respond in kind , " and to know that I have been in the care of a distinguished scientist . " She colored deeply , still abashed by him . Well , that ca n't hurt now , can it ? " I hope , " she said , frowning , " that you do accept my apologies . I greatly regret what was done to you . It was most inhospitable . " She was serious . The apology was not just a formality . Had there been disagreement about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in partial dis- sent from whoever controlled this place ? Or was this merely deeply ingrained courtesy ? So far two mistakes for Podraig and the Captain Abbess . The Zylongi had picked up traces of the Iona , and somewhere in their mythology lurked a red-haired giant . Nice going fellas , he thought . If you 've made any more , you can forget about O'Neill . Aloud , he said , " I accept your apologies , Doctor Samaritha . If one is to be examined as I have been , it is at least consoling to know that it has been done by a competent and gracious woman . " She now was so embarrassed that she seemed ready to run from the room . " You do have a poet 's skill with words , Poet O'Neill . " They 're great ones for titles around here , are n't they ? " If you 're a biologist , then you 've at least discovered that I 'm not a god  --  despite the red hair . " " You are interesting biologically . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different in some ways . My colleagues find your data fascinating . " She had him at a disadvantage ? after all , she had taken off his clothes and not the opposite ( except , of course , in his imagination and that did n't count ) . But she still would n't look at him . Women had been avoiding his eyes lately . " In addition to being biologically interesting , what else did you learn about me ? " O'Neill inquired . " I have the feeling you did n't miss much . " The beautiful doctor flushed again . " I am sorry , Poet O'Neill , that the probe had to be so thorough . To violate someone 's modesty without permission is a terrible offense . I must ask again that you forgive me . " " As many times as you ask ? " he turned on all his Taran charm " ? I 'll forgive you , Doctor  --  and a few times extra for good measure . " She laughed , reassured , and actually sat down on the hard chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sometimes  | the probe has uncomfortable aftereffects . Here , let me check your pulse . " She checked it by touching his throat rather than his wrist . Wow , O'Neill thought as she leaned over him , if someone has to take off my clothes and inspect my biology , she 'll do nicely . Still no hint of whether they had broken through with the probe . " So you found that I was ungodlike . I hope you found that I was not about to destroy your world . " She glanced at a disk on her jacket . " A bit slow by our standards . " Her fingers seemed to linger a tiny bit longer than necessary on his throat . " But apparently quite acceptable for your biology .... We find you to be utterly and completely harmless . " She consulted her record board again . " Poet Seamus O'Neill , an exile from Tara  --  for certain infractions that need not concern us  --  space minstrel , wanderer from world to world , entertaining as he goes . Low on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We welcome you to Zylong . We are sorry that our first meeting with you was inhospitable . We will try to make your sojourn here pleasing . " She finally glanced at him and smiled . O'Neill felt his heart do some odd things . She looked back at her record board and blushed . " I wonder if I may ask you a question that is perhaps inappropriately personal . It . . . it is not strictly within the limits of my professional discipline . But I fear that our students of behavior would never dare ask you . " " Ah , there 's no harm in that . " " We noticed , we could hardly help notice that you kissed me in the jungle before I , ah , sedated you . " " Did I now ? " Seamus O'Neill , you 're a damn fool . Violating one of their taboos the first thing you do on this heathen world . " Is that acceptable behavior in your culture ? " She had turned a dusky purple . Sure she 's terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think there 's anything wrong with a little kiss . If it 's not done here , I 'm apologetic altogether . "  | " Of course we kiss , but in the privacy of the chamber , and only with our mate or our promised . " " We do that too , " Seamus decided to temporize . " But we had not been formally introduced . We are not mated or promised . Was it therefore appropriate by your cultural norms ? " " Well now . . . " You might as well tell the truth . " You seemed afraid of me and I wanted to let you know that I would n't hurt you . " " I see . That was very kind of you . I was frightened and you did , ah , reassure me ? " She looked like Eve might have after she ate the apple : her averted face and her body , leaning inward in self-protection , hinted at a mixture of fascination , fear , and guilt . " ? as well as astonish me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " Forbidden fruit ? " he asked , thinking of Eve . " I have been asked by many ? " she was studying her clipboard intently " ? what the experience was like . " " And ... ? " " I laugh , " she laughed , and was radiantly beautiful , " and say that it was like being kissed in public by any red-bearded god . " What did Murtaugh MacMurtaugh say in their ethics class ? Nothing is more pleasant than violating mores in the search for truth . " I 'm sorry if I caused you any embarrassment , " he said , meaning about half of what he said . " In your culture , then , such signs of affection are permitted between doctor and patient ? " She was making notes on her clipboard . Now Seamus 's big Irish tongue got him into trouble , big trouble . Most of the problems that would later arise resulted from the tiny , wee fib he told . " Nothing would be thought wrong with it at all , at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healing process , if you take my meaning . "  | A harmless exaggeration . Ile did n't expect to be taken seriously . " Really ? " she looked up from her notes . " I could see that it might .... " " No more than two or three times a day , however . " After all , it was a very chaste kiss . " Really ! " She made another note . " How very interesting . " " Some of the scholar folk have done research which indicates that it helps the recovery process , speeds it up something terrible .... " Well , if they have n't done it , they ought to have . " How extremely interesting ! " Another note , now with eyes anywhere but on him . " How many days have I been here in your hospital ? " " We call it a Body Center . " She finally looked at him . " Two days . This is the morning of the third . " " That means ? " he was only joking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe five kisses . I 'll have to be catching up . " " How astonishing . " She made more notes , scribbling rapidly . " That 's fascinating . I must share this with my anthropological colleagues as soon as possible . " The devil made Seamus Finnbar O'Neill do what he did next . He reached out from his couch , grabbed the woman 's arm , drew her toward him , put his other arm around her waist , and brushed his lips against hers  --  briefly , but twice . " Now you only owe me two . " She wore some sort of thin but firm corset garment underneath her wrap . He permitted half of his hand to slip down toward her rear end ; and delightfully solid it was too . She did not resist or pull away . " That is not our custom , " she said blandly , her lips trembling , and delightfully solid lips they were too . " It is not ,  | however , unpleasant . " She drew several strong lines under some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " ' That depends on whether you liked it . " " Of course I liked it , Poet O'Neill . I am not immune to human reactions , even if I am a Research Director . " " Well , I 'm glad of that anyway . " Careful , Seamus me boy . Your big mouth might be getting you Into trouble . This woman loves sinning something terrible . Time would prove that an understatement . She scribbled frantically . " And what would you folks be planning to do with me next , lock me up in a cage , where the common folks of Zylong can come and stare at the red-bearded nongod ? " " Of course not . " Her dark eyes flashed dangerously . " We are not savages . You will be our guest until your machine can be repaired . We have no such machines here , so it may require some time . " She tucked her note pad under her arm and edged toward the door . " Where you will be housed has yet to be determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through our Health Center . Is that accept-able ? " " Anything you say , ma'am . " He sighed loudly and patiently . She paused at the door . " We will ask many questions , you should not think this hostile . " " I guess I am a questionable phenomenon . " He smiled his most charming smile . " Quite . " Swiftly and gracefully she glided back to the couch , bent over him , and touched his lips with hers , permitting Seamus an extensive , if very brief , view of her breasts . Twice . " I believe we 're even now , Poet O'Neill . " " For the last two days , " he stammered . " We shall see about the future . " She vanished through the doorway . I think I 'm in deep trouble . I 'm nothing more than a horny  | adolescent male . God wo n't hold it against her . But no good can come of violating your most powerful mores . Murtaugh again . Still , she wanted to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I 'll have to kiss every lovely woman on the planet as part vi my spying mission . Sure she practically forced me into it . Ile pondered with satisfaction the possibility of Zylong being a vast harem for himself and decided that it was a fantasy he ought not to encourage . The Lady Abbess would not be amused . No , decidedly not . Technician Londrau was an enthusiastic young man with a voice as flat as the Iona 's computer , if not a comparably foul mouth . However , the exhausting tour that he conducted of the Health Center took Seamus 's mind off his lovely boss ? more or less . It was an enormous complex of buildings , housing various hospitals and research facilities with massive banks of equipment and a huge staff of workers , much larger , it seemed to Seamus , than the work required . For the first time , he began to feel not only like a foreigner , but an uncultivated one at that . There were at least twice as many workers in the medical complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geese , and pilgrims on the Iona . While , as far as Seamus could see , the Zylongi had no greater medical capabilities than did the tiny medical staff of the monastery , they put a lot more of their resources into health care . Of course , he told himself , they have more money and more people . The trouble with you , Seamus O'Neill , is that you 're a peasant who has spent all his life with eccentrics , characters , oddballs , and other related peculiar types . Sure they 've shown you the films and the pictures and made you read the books , but your world has been alloy hull and half a thousand people for the quarter century you 've been around . Now you 're in a great city of a mature and sophisticated civilization . You 'll gawk every time you turn around if you 're  | not careful . ( ) nce they become accustomed to your height and your great , terrible red beard , they 'll see you for the bumpkin you really are . Especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure they were n't really that powerful kisses . Just little pecks , if you take my meaning . " These are the hordi on which Director Samaritha is doing her most important research , " Londrau droned on . " See how clean their quarters are and how well they are treated . The Director is teaching them to read and communicate . They are not the domestic strain who act as our servants , but the wild species from the desert and the jungle . Yet note how quiet and happy they are . " The hordi were diminutive creatures , a little more than four feet tall and indeed looked much like the protohominids in the textbooks in Seamus 's biology courses . About a dozen were eating and sleeping and playing with and nursing their young , huddling together in a large area that had been arranged to look like a jungle habitat . Indeed , they seemed placid and gentle , unperturbed by the four white-clad technicians who were monitoring them . " We do not even need cages , " Londrau boasted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That shows good taste on their part , " O'Neill agreed . " Obviously they are an earlier stage of the evolutionary process . Prehominids . " Probably the natives of the planet . They had managed to survive along with the colonists from Earth , the ancestors of the Zylongi . Of course , on Earth , the various pre- and protohominids had survived for aeons , side by side , if in different ecological niches . Till Cro-Magnon man occupied all the niches . " Certainly not . " The Technician fought to control his temper . " They are obviously unrelated to us . " " I see , " said Seamus , who did not in fact see at all . There were enough traits of these docile , attractive little creatures in the Zylongi to leave little doubt that there had been cohabitation sometime in the past . Samaritha 's faintly pointed  | teeth , for example . Nothing wrong with that , but why deny it ? The more fascinating question was why the prehominids on Zylong were so similar to those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or had some prehistoric visitors brought species from Tara to this world , where they had survived long after their species had become extinct on Earth ? If the Zylongi had such hangups about their prehominid neighbors that they denied the mixing of the two species , they could hardly be expected to know the answer to that question  --  not that it was particularly important for Seamus 's purposes to learn the answer . " You perhaps have noticed that they are not naked ? " Londrau 's singsong voice interrupted O'Neill 's reflections . " Ah , are n't they now . Sure ' t is a good thing you called my attention to it . I would n't have noticed it at all . " This guy is beyond belief . " It is very interesting . Once they have learned to communicate with us , they wish to clothe themselves . We permit it , of course . They seem to learn shame with the power of communication . " " Or maybe just imitation . " That stopped Technician Londrau cold . " What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pad . " Fascinating . " Seamus considered whether he would want to engage in sex with the slender little female hordi , nervous darting creatures with pert breasts and slim hips . They were appealing enough , he supposed , if you did n't have your own women around or if you found excitement in brutalizing the frightened and the powerless . Since Seamus did n't enjoy the latter much , even in fantasies , he decided that the little critters were not much threat to his virtue . Well , did n't you enjoy the doctor 's fright ? Yeah , but she 's not powerless . I am . More or less .  | As the tour continued , Seamus noted several more interesting phenomena . First of all , only a few members of the staff seemed to be working very hard . The energetic types like Samaritha and Londrau were far outnumbered by those Who did n't seem to be doing much at all , save for filling out forms and sitting at desks watching what seemed to be video monitors . They moved slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were , however , quite interested in him . An ever-changing band of gawkers followed him through the spotlessly clean , indirectly lighted pink and beige corridors and rooms of the medical complex , chattering away about him , just quietly enough so he could not hear them . " Begone , you curious rabble , " he had shouted at them once , more or less for the hell of it , waving his arms in a mighty theatrical gesture . That band of gawkers fled in terror , to be replaced a few moments later by another crowd . " That was very amusing , " Londrau commented in a tone of voice appropriate for an obituary , making an inevitable note . " You frightened them . " " Just gave them something to talk about , " Seamus sighed . " Of course , " said his guide , scrawling away . " Fascinating . " Secondly , there were only a few elderly people in the Body Center . Either they were treated elsewhere , or Zylong had another way of dealing with the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but decided not to ask about it , not yet . Finally , while the Body Center was clean , neat , airy , and well illuminated , it did n't seem to work very well . Many of the lifts were not functioning . Banks of terminals were not lighted , the workers staring idly at the empty screens . Several large machines  --  for the making of blood and nourishment he was told obscurely  --  were also inactive . Each time it was explained to Seamus that these mechanisms were " temporarily waiting repair . "  | Now on the Iona , most everything was messy , as the Lady Abbess constantly complained . The Trans did n't mind mess at all  --  not so long as they could take their three showers a day . In fact , the more mess the better : it was a sign work was being done . Sometimes when you were a little lazy , you 'd make a mess just so your fellow pilgrims would think you were working , a technique at which Seamus O'Neill was , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery functioned , even if it was n't needed . A Taran took any nonworking machine  --  even if it was a tertiary backup mechanism that had never been used in the whole pilgrimage  --  as a personal insult , a challenge to his or her integrity and honor . Overstaffed and with broken-down equipment , he summarized for himself and anyone who might be listening on Iona . Of course , they may have the resources to be able to afford both . " You benefited from the tour ? " Samaritha demanded when she found him later , reclining , half-asleep , on his couch . " Fascinating , " he replied . " Incidentally , one question . What is the meaning of the metal  --  I 'd call it silver  --  band many of you wear around your neck ? " " This ? " She touched her band shyly . " It is our mating band . On the day my man  --  the Music Director  --  and I were formally mated , he put this link around my neck . And I a similar one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a chain of love which is to bind us together for life . Do you not have a similar custom ? " " We use rings , same symbolism , however . " " Interesting ... you do not wear such a ring , Poet O'Neill ? " " When one is a space tramp like myself , how would one find a woman ? And what kind of a woman would mate with me anyway ? " His self-pity was so convincing that he almost believed the story was true .  | " Interesting . " Yet another note . " And lamentable , of course . " " Terrible altogether . " " Now as to your residence during your sojourn with us . " She became very official . " You may rest for several more hours . At sunset you may come to the living space of Music Director Ornigon and make your home with us . The Committee has decided that he and I will be your hosts . We will take refreshment there . Technical Student Horor , our son , may join us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us briefly . Some companions of our quarter will take nourishment with us . Afterward there will be a contest . Does this meet with your pleasure ? " She sounded like Podraig reading out a program . " And if it does n't ? " he said dryly and not too politely . Her eyes locked with his again in the same vulnerable plea that he had seen at the landing site . There was a fleeting moment of shared desire . She looked away  --  more slowly this time . So , I trouble you just as you trouble me ? O'Neill thought . She was the kind of woman you wanted to take in your arms . He imagined the frightened , eager beating of her heart as his hands tightened around her . Slow down , Seamus . This is a flirtation , nothing more . Remember that , you dummy . " I am afraid , Poet O'Neill , that I do not understand , " she said slowly , as though quite mystified . " Perhaps we should postpone the scheduled events ? " O'Neill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just fine with him . She left the room  --  or was it a cell ? ? still puzzled by the Taran 's response . The lovely doctor spoke formally . Was that the way the Zylongi always talked ? She accepted that he was a downand-out space tramp  --  at least she said she did . A " Director of Research " and a " Music Director " ( her husband ? ? she had spoken of their son ) were obviously important people . Why would they host a space bum ? The " Secretary " and the " Guide " must be very important , too , otherwise why  | would a brief visit be described with such awe ? Why would such personages waste their time with someone who was no threat ? The first stirring of suspicion began to poke at the back of his brain . The good doctor knew more than she was telling . He wondered if the refreshment had a bit of " the creature " in it . Sure a wee touch of it would n't hurt a bit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not the way he loved his hostess , Sammy  --  a mild and , he hoped , harmless , if exciting , flirtation . Not the way he loved any of the objects of his crushes on Iona , not even the way he loved Tessie . No , this is , Seamus mentally insisted , the real thing . Marjetta was his fate , his destiny , the one great love of his life . It had taken him a long time to make that decision  --  slightly in excess of a half minute . This conclusion might notably affect his mission to Zylong , if only by distracting him something terrible . It would certainly involve the eventual landing of Iona on the island in the river that Podraig had tentatively chosen . Marjetta would have to forsake her heathen ways . All these were minor details . This was the proper woman Seamus had been searching for all his long and hectic life . Well , for the last six months anyway . To begin with , she treated Seamus with total contempt . He was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a worthless derelict , a loudmouthed braggart , a bit of a biological freak , a poseur who might deceive the older folks on Zylong but was transparent to the superior wisdom of her nineteen years ( Taran time ) . No one appealed to Seamus O'Neill more than a woman who saw right through him . Moreover , she was devastatingly lovely , tall for a Zylongi , tall even for a Taran , lithe and willowy , short brown hair , a gently curved face , strong , expressive mouth , flashing eyes , absolutely irresistible legs , the confident shoulders of a competent military officer  --  Ah , my dear Margie , you 're the 51  | most proper of proper women . ' Twill be hard to win you , but that 's part of the fun . She was not part of Sammy and Ernie 's crowd , but rather a friend of their son , Horor , and his " promised , " a cold , rather hard-eyed young woman named Carina , both of whom seemed to be students somewhere and neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaving , in other words , the way he had toward his elders only a few years ago . If the older generation on Zylong found him fascinating and interesting , the younger generation clearly found him boring if not disgusting . Red-bearded giant space tramp ? What could be more deadly dull ? At first Seamus was annoyed . After all , did n't his program claim he was a bit of a rebel ? And should n't young people identify with a rebel ? Besides , did n't he have a quick smile and a quicker tongue ? Did n't women invariably find him charming ? Why , then , did Carina and especially Marjetta turn away in disgust when he would pay a certainly not undeserved compliment to one of the older women guests as they ate the candied fruits that apparently played the same preprandial role on Zylong as the poteen , straight up , did among Tarans ? ( The " candy " in the fruit , or maybe even the fruit itself , contained a chemical at least as powerful as the poteenloosening O'Neill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't like him , which was a challenge to O'Neill . He almost forgot that the space-lout mask he wore concealed the real O'Neill , whom , of course , Marjetta would find irresistible . Did n't everyone ? Why should he feel defensive about a persona which was n't his anyway ? " And so what do soldiers do on this planet ? " he had inquired , harmlessly enough . " Protect it from invaders , " he was told tersely , with a slight shrug of absolutely glorious shoulders . " How many of those have you had lately , not counting myself of course ? " " None . "  | " Ah then , there ca n't be much work to do . " " We manage to occupy ourselves . " " Sure I suppose there are scores of you assigned to watch me and you 'll be my constant escort  --  to keep an eye on me , of course . " " It would appear that no one believes you are much of a threat . " " But you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand red-bearded space tramps . " A contemptuous twist of her lovely lips . " Nor redbearded gods of hordi legend who are supposed to return to redeem them . " " Kind of confident of your military capability , are n't you ? " Another pretty shrug . " It is adequate for our needs . " " Where did the hordi get this legend ? " " Ask them . Perhaps it is a memory of the species which brought them here before we came . " " Ah , is that what happened ? " " What do you think ? " " I think it is an interesting question of whether there is hordi blood in a lot of you folk . " He waited for an explosion . " Are you trying to shock me by challenging the official wisdom ? Come now , Space Tramp O'Neill , surely you have noted the slightly pointed teeth ? " " Not on you . . . . And why did a lovely woman like you become a member of the officer caste ? " " My family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my role . " " When you were a wee lass . " " When I was born . Were you assigned to be a wandering minstrel ? " In a tone of voice that could n't have cared less . " Ah , no . I chose it of my own free will . " " How degenerate . " " Would you want to be something else , I mean not a soldier at all ? " " That is an absurd question . "  | Ah , thought Seamus proudly , I 'm making great progress well , maybe I am at that . There is contempt in some of them for the party line . And anger , lots of anger .... The relationship between Horor , the son of the house , and his " promised " mate was strange . They snapped unpleasantly at one another and argued almost every time they opened their mouths . He treated her like an empty-headed flake , and she reacted to him like he was a stuffy dullard . Yet , later on they left the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy whispered a hasty explanation in his ear . On Zylong young people were assigned their spouses and their careers shortly after birth , based on a careful study of their antecedents , so that the best possible genetic combinations would result . Sometimes they resisted this sorting process and refused to mate with their " promised . " This was possible . Marjetta , a truly remarkable young woman , Sammy declared nervously , had insisted in delaying indefinitely her mating with the soldier to whom she had been promised . This could mean a life in which one did not marry , though sometimes the Committee would make exceptions , particularly if the petitioner was more humble than Marjetta was ever likely to be . Other young people would accept their fate but never become emotionally attached to their mate . Yet others would find love after they had been mated for some time . Carina and Horor , the Most High be praised , were falling in love now , though they had to pretend to hate each other because that was the way with young people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with certainty , " Sammy concluded breathlessly . " This is the way you and himself got together , " O'Neill nodded in the direction of his handsome , cultivated , gentle host . " But of course . And you see how well we are matched . The Committee is very wise , is it not ? " O'Neill did n't think that this intense , almost manic woman was at all well matched with her reflective , melan- choly mate . Whether they loved each other or not was less clear . Sammy was , however , a Zylongi I'anglossa , the kind of enthusiast who had to persuade others and herself that everything was for the best . " Marjetta is a lovely girl , " he commented carefully . " So you are of the same humanity as we , " she grinned , almost wickedly . " All men think that . Perhaps someday she will find a man for herself . She may have to pay a heavy price , however . " O'Neill did not want to know what that heavy price might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " Sammy said , with a sad shake of her curls  --  and there was even more gray in them than O'Neill had noticed before , " both killed in battle . " " I thought there were no invaders here . Who is there to fight ? " Sammy looked around nervously , fearful that other guests might hear them . " It is not wise to discuss that . " Aha . It 's matters like that you 're supposed to be investigating , Seamus O'Neill , not taking off Lieutenant Marjetta 's clothes in your imagination . Well , you can do both , ca n't you ? After all , you 're young and the juices are flowing like they 're supposed to . So the party went on , and Seamus Finnbar O'Neill found himself even more puzzled by his strange hosts . On the one hand , they purported to kiss only their mates and them only in the " private chamber " ; on the other hand , they seemed to be preparing to turn the party in his honor into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and at the moment Seamus was prepared to be tolerant on that point  --  why could n't they be consistently decadent ? Then the event for which everyone had anxiously waited  --  the arrival of the Guide and the Fourth Secretary . The former was a doddering old man who smiled politely , nodded in answer to his own routine questions , and fluttered around shaking hands with everyone . He apologized to Poet O'Neill for any discourtesy . The First Ones and especially  | the Founder had strictly forbidden discourtesy . Before Seamus could praise the courtesy , the old man went on in as singsong voice , " You are welcome . Strangers are always welcome . We are honored . Enjoy your stay . Tell good things about us . Thank you thank you . " " If it 's all the same to you , " Seamus whispered to the Deity , " I 'll keep the Lady Deirdre if you do n't mind . " The Fourth Secretary was something else , a gombeen man if Seamus ever met one  --  short , fat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else on Zylong did ) , patronizing the men with false geniality , reveling in the power he obviously had over their lives . He especially offended O'Neill by his frankly lascivious fascination with Marjetta  --  who in her turn treated the Fourth Secretary with the same contempt she had turned on Seamus . I 'm not that type at all , at all , he protested in his head . " Well , I see the red-bearded god has come at last , " the Fourth Secretary smiled at Seamus . " You are , of course , most welcome . " " Only if impoverished space travelers without fuel or money can be considered gods , " Seamus replied evenly . " You are too modest . Our probes reveal that you are a man of many talents . " " All which pale before the talents of the population of this astonishing civilization . " " You speak well . " The Fourth Secretary did not seem happy about that fact . " Poets do . " " So do you like our planet ? What about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe ? " " There is much beauty in the universe . Zylong is especially rich in it . " Sure did Margie actually smile a little at that ? " You will stay with us long ? " " Only till my vehicle is repaired or till you grow tired of me. "  | " Oh , we never grow tired of giant red-bearded gods . " " Do n't you now ? " If you 're listening up there , Your Ladyship , this one is the Enemy . With a crude guffaw , the Fourth Secretary took his leave . Everyone seemed to unwind ; the worst was over . The three young people wanted to leave a few minutes after the politician , but Sammy demanded that they stay while Seamus sang for them . " Space bards are noted singers , " she said primly . The three kids made faces of resigned disgust . Seamus chose to ignore them and to concentrate on the lovely Lieutenant while he sang . It is well for small birds that can rise up on high and warble away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my millionfold love that so far from each other must rise every day . She 's more white than the lily and lovely past Beauty , more sweet than the violin , more bright than the sun , with a mind and refinement surpassing all these ... 0 God in Your Heaven give ease to my pain ! " Good-bye , Honored Guest , " Marjetta said with what in someone else would be described as a sneer . " I 'm sure we 'll not meet again . " Not a word about my song , even though I did it just for you ? " That would be a tragedy for me . Do n't I get a little credit because himself does n't like me . " " A very little , " she said , blessing him with a grudging smile . " Not enough to say you 'd like to meet me again ? " " Certainly not . " Women , they 're the devil . A half hour later he was telling himself  --  in mental tones of vigorous warning , not unmixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him brushed her hair against his shoulder once more , he would go to pieces altogether . He took another wee sip of " refreshment " to calm his nerves and contemplate the torso of Energy Supervisor Niora , which was hardly an inch away from his face . It looked like he had gotten himself into a Zylongi orgy all right , a cultivated , civilized orgy indeed , but then those might be the worst kind . From wondering which of the women he might be supposed to sleep with , he had turned to fearing that he might have to sleep with them all . A fantasy which , for all his self image as a horny young male , scared the living daylights out of Seamus Finnbar O ' - Neill . And for all his talk and fantasy about love , when it came to action  --  Seamus O'Neill was prepared to admit to himself at the moment  --  he was not particularly experienced or confident . Not when faced with these mature and certainly practiced beauties who lolled around the table , blatantly flirting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement . Brigid , Patrick , and Columcile , save and protect me , he pleaded with considerable fervor . Soft light glowed from the lemon-colored walls of the " living space . " Matching music and odors filled the air . The bodies of the guests were languid . Hairless male chests and soft female shoulders crowded around the table . Hemming him on either side , the relaxed forms of Energy Supervisor Niora and State Painter Reena were almost enough to keep his mind off the legs of his hostess as she padded around the table serving food with the aid of a chimpanzeelike hordi . Research Director Samaritha , he mused , you have as satisfactory a pair of legs as I 've ever seen , save for Marjetta 's , of course , but that was another matter . No , your legs and thighs are not too stocky at all . And the rear end is practically perfect . All you can think about , O'Neill , is women . Well , under the circumstances , how can I think of anything else ?  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that we do not try to improve on Mozart ? " O'Neill tried to focus his attention . He had matched the other guests drink for drink . They apparently were able to drink a good Taran under the table . Not that la-ir , a pink ice cream concoction , was all that weak a drink ; it reminded Seamus of a twenty-third  --  century beverage he once consumed called a stinger . " To tell you the truth , lovely lady , I 'm not sure what to think just at the moment . " His eyes followed the curve of her throat and the slope of her shoulders to the top of the thin blue wraparound that was evening dress for Zylongi women . He fantasized about the corsetlike affair that was presumably under it . The garment , he had learned , was called a lentat , the same name as for his undergarment , but presumably of rather different structure and purpose , given the strapless gowns and flowing but disciplined charms of the Zylongi women . How would one go about removing it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to . Who cares about Mozart ? " Your Guardians permit complete license in music , Honored Guest O'Neill ? " Niora asked , seductively caressing her goblet . " They do n't see any harm in it . We let men like Music Director Ornigon compose their own music and interpret other composers any way they want . " " But that is very strange , Honored Poet . Does it not make for great competition ? " Her lovely brow furrowed . Are all the Zylongi women so sumptuously beautiful ? And are there others around like Marjetta ? That would be something terrible altogether . He paused before answering . Why had there been only a few polite queries about his trip , his background ? Maybe they were n't interested , or maybe courtesy or orders forbade them to ask . Finally he replied cautiously , " We believe that competition makes for excellence . " Niora began to say something but then sipped her drink instead . He tried to concentrate on the creamy food , of which he  | was eating too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disconcerting sensual atmosphere . Niora interrupted his thoughts . " Was not the I ionored Music Director 's recording of Mozart that we heard before the nourishment excellent ? There are many paths to excellence within the official interpretation . " Seamus shifted his weight to put a little more distance between his lips and her shoulders . He thought it had been a clever but stilted and wooden Hafner symphony , but one that fit the atmosphere perfectly . He dug into the cream thing again . You 're making a pig out of yourself , O'Neill . Niora moved her body closer than ever . " Do you not find me attractive , Poet O'Neill ? " He choked on the cream . " Sure , I 'd have to be a hunk of stone not to think you 're one of the most lovely women in the cosmos . " " Now you exaggerate , Honored Poet , " she scolded him . " But you often do not look at me . During formal nourishment we are to enjoy one another 's bodies . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find your body very attractive . " Brigid , Patrick , and Columcile , what have I gotten into ? Here she is sitting next to her husband , Secondary Principal Gemmoff ! " I 've been wandering through space alone for such a long time , I guess I 'm numb , " he said weakly . " But please enjoy me while we eat . It is good to be admired by an Honored Guest . " She lowered her eyes , smiled shyly , and began eating again . " Is admiration a prelude to violence in your world ? " " Uh ... no , of course not . I guess we .. . well , we are a little more restrained in the way we do it . " " And less restrained in your violence . " " We do n't believe in violence to women , " he said firmly , noting to himself that practice did n't always follow theory . " How unusual . Does admiration mean that you will enter a woman 's body ? "  | " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . " He took another strong drink of their poteen and decided that he would n't do anything until someone else did . What if they were all waiting for him ? He slopped up some more of the thick black cream . " I see you like our dark cream , Poet O'Neill , " said the Music Director , a thin man with iron-gray hair and a warm , lovely smile . " ' T is wonderful altogether . I suppose it comes from your heathenish furry cattle . " " Heathenish ? " " Ah , just a manner of speaking . " O'Neill turned his attention away from the languid form of State Painter Reena . " All our food comes from the same common crops and from the milk of our cattle . Our scientists , like my Honored Mate , have developed many ways of synthesizing these simple staples into a variety of foods . " He talked briskly , like a gombeen man trying to make a sale . O'Neill did n't think his heart was in it , though . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wee compliment for the cook never hurts . His host smiled proudly . " Ah , my mate has many gifts . " It was n't what one would expect from a man contem. plating swapping wives for an evening . O'Neill turned back to his own dinner companion , lying quietly next to him , delicately chewing on a small piece of pastry . " Am I supposed to pay compliments or would that be rude ? You 're so pretty that my voice gets caught in my throat when I try to talk with you . " A pleased rose glow spread over her dark skin . Her smile accepted him . " That in itself is a very nice compliment . To look is all that is required  --  really all that is proper . " " I would n't want to be improper . But I wo n't take back the compliment , " he insisted . " Certain exceptions are made for visitors , especially if they are poets . " She lowered her eyes modestly , now very  | satisfied indeed with her dinner companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgy . Well , it might have been fun . No telling what I could have learned . Looking was all that was expected . The guests reclined in intimate and proximate positions , but none of them touched . You had to be very observing of your partner 's moves to maintain the few inches of space that separated you . When her gorgeous little ass shifted too close to your thigh , you simply moved a fraction of an inch . Skillful , but what a waste of energy . He managed once to " accidentally " brush his shoulder against Samaritha 's thigh as she leaned over to serve him what seemed to be the tenth or eleventh course . She jumped back , a look of anger and horror on her face . Seamus mumbled an apology about Tarans being a clumsy people . It was graciously , if formally , accepted . To distract himself from Niora , he asked about the hordi . The subject was one on which everyone had an opinion ? all of it spoken much the way children recite memory work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were obviously not hominid ; probably they were not even related to hominid ancestors . Their evolutionary progress was very slow , if it had not ceased altogether . They were quite savage in their native habitat but could be domesticated if captured early enough or born in captivity . They made pleasant pets and useful if dull servants . Some of Samaritha 's most important work was the selective breeding of the hordi to upgrade the strain of the domesticated type . It was a difficult and frustrating task , as there was so little in the hordi gene pool with which one could work . Now all of this was patent nonsense . The tiny female hordi  --  four feet high  --  who waited on them clearly had a hominid body under her plain brown wrap . She was not anything like an ape . Her speech was rudimentary , clicks and grunts , but her hands were almost human . She was made for upright rather than quadruped movement ; fur- thermore , one look at their pointed teeth showed where the %vlongi had acquired their " interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossbreed with humanoids ; at one Ilene in the history of the Zylong planet , they had done so . Presumably such breeding was stopped , and now there was a cultural need to deny its possibility . O'Neill wondered how a scientist like Samaritha could talk such nonsense . He also found that the little creature could smile back at him , with a kind of knowing complacency : We both know they 're pious frauds , the servant girl seemed to be hinting . And we both survive by exploiting their fraud . Was the domestic hordi attractive when she smiled , a young body , tiny but neat breasts , quick appealing motions ? Sure she is attractive . O'Neill revised his opinion of the aborigines upward . Men without women could easily be tempted to make love to such creatures . Had it been that way with parallel species on Earth ? Once we evolved beyond the monthly " heat " phase , why the hell not ? So that 's what our ancestors were up to . The dirty things . The last course finally came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . The sensuality of the dinner ended . Niora 's gloriously relaxed charm became formal again  --  to both the relief and sorrow of O'Neill . Even the room temperature , which had risen to almost jungle heat during the meal , seemed to fall abruptly . Party 's over , kids , O'Neill thought . Off to the " contest " ? whatever that is . The arena was in the same quarter of the City as the apartment building in which his hosts lived . They descended in an elevator and walked across a brilliantly lighted and crowded plaza . Once more O'Neill felt like a bumpkin come to the big city  --  which of course was precisely what he was . I wonder how long you can sustain this cosmopolitan place , Seamus me boy . Soon they 'll smell the aroma of cattle on you and know what you really are . The descendant of a people whose great epics are about stealing bulls from one another . Outside , the night air was balmy and pleasant . Thou- sands of people crowded toward a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that angled off the plaza . ' I'hev entered the building , took an elevator down , and emerged at the edge of a vast arena that appeared to be part gym nasium and part swimming pool . The audience sat on tiers made up of deeply cushioned contour chairs . You watch your sports in comfort on this planet , O'Neill observed to himself . The contest was between the Northeast Quarter  --  where Samaritha and Ornigon lived  --  and the South Central Quarter . His hosts had pinned small red and white ribbons to their coats ; the other side wore yellow and blue . There was no attempt to segregate the supporters of the two teams . The contest began with a formal ritual that made him think of the Japanese No plays he had seen on the Iona 's video screens . Then the contest began in earnest : a combination of volleyball , water polo , and field hockey , played by superbly conditioned young men and women with grace and skill  --  almost like an elaborate ballet  --  their strong young bodies covered only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexes . ( I still do n't see how you get them off a woman without tugging , he thought . ) It was a vicious and violent ballet . O'Neill never cringed from working mayhem with a hurling stick on the Iona 's playing field , but he knew he could never slash at a woman with the stick . The young Zylongi males had no such compunctions , and the young women were not reluctant to fight back . Even worse , it seemed to O'Neill , was the contrast between the destructiveness of the contest and the demeanor of the audience . Calm and controlled to the point of blandness , they applauded skillful play and showed no reaction at all at the sight of a broken limb or lacerated face . The whole wild enterprise seemed only faintly amusing to them . It was hard to tell if they even cared about whether their team won or not . He tried his best to remember his anthropological manners , but when a tiny girl was carried off the floor with a  | broken arm hanging limply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped in disgust . Leaning in his direction , Samaritha quietly reassured him . " Do not worry about her , l lonored Poet Guest . The contest surgeons are very skillful . In a day or two there will be no trace of injury . She will play in the next contest . " " But how does she feel now ? " " Perhaps pleased that she has played well . Much worse happened to me when I was in the contest . I was proud to have played well . " She drew back into her couch . The bloodshed ended with a victory for the home team . Secondary Principal Gemmoff was congratulated  --  it was his school 's team . The glory of the Northeast Quarter was preserved . The other two couples , who lived in another tower , went home . O'Neill and his hosts returned to the family living space for yet more refreshment and more music . " Do you have anything like the contest on Tara , Poet Guest ? " the Music Director asked formally , as though it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O'Neill tried to describe hurley and Gaelic football . He was not at all sure , though , that the interest his hosts indicated meant either comprehension or appreciation . Both wild games were apparently too tame for their tastes . Samaritha was offended that young women were not permitted in the same contests as men . She seemed not to understand Seamus 's explanation of fear of injury . He changed the subject . He asked whether the Music Director had played in the contest when he was in secondary school . " Alas , it is not permitted to us who are programmed for the arts to participate in the contest . The Research Director brought glory to both of us . In the quarter there was much pride in her skill . " There was a curious melancholy in his voice . " Well , when she gets mad at you , you must be careful to avoid letting her get hold of a stick . " The joke , which he would not have tried had it not been for the poteen , fell flat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . We are mates , " said Ornigon , obviously astonished and perhaps a little pained . Samaritha 's blush was fiery red . " One does not hit another with the stick , save in the contest ! " she exploded . " ' li ) use the stick outside the contest would be savage . I do not understand what you are saying . " So there it was . Stylized but rigidly controlled violence and stylized but rigidly controlled sensuality were both enjoyed by the Zylongi in the lower depths of their personalities but kept under rigid social controls in their conscious lives . It 's a way to live , thought Seamus O'Neill as he drifted off into a sleep crowded with voluptuous brown bodies and bloody sticks .  | The back of his neck twitched again . Seamus O'Neill whirled around . There was nothing behind him , the bridge was empty , the winding street behind it dark and deserted . There was no sign of life in the buildings on the other side of the bridge . Yet someone had been watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . . . spying on the spy . Well , that 's fair enough . It was , he had concluded earlier in the day , a planet that had been dominated by terror for centuries  --  the terror imposed by those determined to do good and to constrain others to do the same . Fanatics . No one worse than a good person , herself had often said , than a good person who knows he 's good . " Or she , " he had added . " Ay , " the Cardinal touched her ruby ring of office , " we women are superior even in fanaticism . " And now the terror of the fanatic was right behind him . He rubbed his neck and turned back to the stream . There was a network of such streams running through the City toward the great river . They were part of the City 's sanitation and water supply system , with bottoms and banks made of the same rocklike substance out of which the buildings were constructed . Once more he felt like an ignorant bumpkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recycling on the Iona was sophisticated . It was a primary-grade student 's childish drawing compared to the immense and sophisticated Zylongian scheme for recycling waste so that it could be used again and again and generate energy in the 67  | process . Moreover , the abundance of natural resources on the planet seemed to make this recycling system unnecessary . The natural process of the swift-flowing river would have cleaned the City 's waste in an hour or two . And the river itself could easily have been channeled to provide hydroelectric power . The Zylongi knew about such things because they had power plants up in the foothills of the mountains ; you respected the forces of nature and did not violate them , as the First Ones and the Founder had taught , but you made up the rules as you went along about what constituted such respect . In the mountains the River was not sacred . Near the City it was . If you began with such definitions , it was all easy . He began to spell " River " in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time it reached the City . You did not pollute the River either with waste or dams and generators . Why not ? Because the First Ones had taught that you must respect the great powers of nature . They contained the Most High . Fair enough , except they were not a religious people , as far as he could tell . And recycling waste was interfering with the processes of nature too . But his task was to observe , not to argue . Nor to look for consistency . A visitor would doubtless find Tarans inconsistent too  --  though , he hoped , more honest with themselves and others about their inconsistency . When caught in a seeming contradiction , the locals here would either argue passionately , like the good Sammy , or sneer like the good Margie . Tarans would simply laugh and say , " Ah well , we never did claim to be logical , now did we ? " He had spent most of the last two days in the " Resource Center " of Zylong , leafing through their various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff ( which had been instructed to bring him everything he wanted , no questions asked ) but almost no clients . For all  | the piety in references to the Founder and the First Ones , there was little interest in their lives or the time of their " Arrival . " Earlier that day , his library search mostly complete , Seamus had slumped over his terminal in the Resource ( ' enter , head in hands . He had seen evil during the years of his pilgrimage on the Iona , but he could not have imagined the barbarism of Zylong 's millennium of history . And he probably did n't know the half of it . No great psychic , Seamus Finnbar Diarmuid Brendan O'Neill , he still felt the terror of Zylong in every nerve ending of his body . He had to get out of here and bring his woman with him as quickly as possible . Still , he told himself , if this place can produce someone like Margie it 's not all bad . He uncrumpled his notes on Sayings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell you folks up there are keeping track of this cow dung , " he whispered to the readers on the monastery . His translator was revealing the sayings in Spacegael , but even in translation it was obvious that they represented different times , different situations , different authors . Some were flat and harsh : Have no congress with beasts . Eliminate those who do . Every woman is a walking womb . Slay them who turn away . Others were more paradoxical : The woman is for the man . Man is for the woman . Food for everyone . Women for everyone . Let them who eat too much , starve . Let them that bear too many be made barren . Destroy those who would make peace . Make peace with those who would destroy .  | Still others made no sense at all : Beware the time of the wind . Beware the word of the prophet . Beware the body of the tempter . Let not sex interfere with your manliness . Let those who disturb go to Zylong to learn peace . Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occasionally moving : In our world we must have only those rules which free the natural human propensity to goodness . Sex is joy for all who will enjoy it . All are equal , men and women , old and young ; let there be no distinctions . Treat all life with respect . No power should endure , lest it corrupt . Reverence all who share this world with us . We must be equal to be free and free to be equal . No freedom which threatens equality . No equality which threatens freedom . There were finally a larger number of sayings that described women , of which the mildest was : " He who kills a male child does a great evil . He who kills a female child prevents a great evil . " It was possible , Seamus thought , that if anyone had the stomach for it , he could find the times in the history of the Zylongi settlement  --  now 1119 Earth-years old  --  for most of these sayings . The reasonable ones went back to the fervent idealism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commonality of property , respect for nature , and complete sexual freedom . Reading between the bland and pious lines of official history , Seamus was able to piece together much of the story in rough outline . It soon turned out the sexual freedom was for men and not for women and it meant that men had the fun and women did the work . " Sexual freedom = sexual slavery for women  | after two generations at the most , " Seamus had scrawled on the paper . There had been a revolt of women that was mercilessly put down . The Great Lords then took hordi females as wives and built great cities all over the plains . In violent and bitter wars , they destroyed one another , tearing down great settlements and destroying much of the machinery they had brought with them . Then came the time of the " First Reorganization " ; sobriety and frugality were imposed by the " Reorganizers , " who pitilessly destroyed all who seemed to have hordi genes in them and began to rebuild the central city where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town from the world and forbade all but the outcasts and " degenerates " to live in the country . Sexual freedom returned . An attempt was made to exterminate all hordi as " evil ones . " There was no explanation of why it had failed . There then followed a time called the " Terrible License " I n which morals degenerated and , according to the sources from that era  --  maybe four centuries ago  --  every vice was practiced , despite the warnings of occasional wise men about the evils of " yielding to the body . " Then came the Second Reorganization about two and a half centuries ago in which a " Guide " and a " Committee of Secretaries " and " Order of Guardians " had been established to maintain " order , discipline , probity . " " A very wise plan , the Second Reorganization , " one of the sages had remarked . Well , Seamus thought , it seems to have kept them from slaughtering one another for two hundred and fifty years , so it ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As much as he was shocked by the stories of torture , massacre , and near genocide , Seamus was impressed by the durability of the original vision and the sincere commitment of the Zylongi , however twisted their methods , to that vision : an orderly world of equality , commonality , and publicly ap- proved virtue . If women and hordi were often attacked , the reason that was given was that they were a threat to virtue . If sex was often denounced , the reason was that it was seen as an obstacle to a sober and rational life of civic responsibility . If personal freedom was constrained , it was in the cause of justice for all . So a thousand years of destruction , tyranny , and death . What had been accomplished ? Well , for the last quarter of a millennium they had created a successful illusion , which maybe was an impressive accomplishment . Now the illusion was fading , still powerful for Sammy 's generation but not for her son 's or for Margie 's . And the illusion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the crisp , quiet library , was palpable . ( Here Seamus was certain , though he could not explain yet why or how . ) Ought that not be enough for the geniuses up on the Iona ? Probably not . They 'd want details of the terror today . Get with it , Seamus . So here he was risking the terror by breaking the local rules and walking along the side of the sanitation system after the " advisory " curfew hour and in a section of town which he had been warned by Sammy was not " suitable " for walking . So what ? Seamus was never one to take such rules very seriously . Besides , the disturbing presence of his host and hostess had begun to overwhelm him . Their relationship was baffling ? especially since they slept in separate rooms , as it would seem did all Zylongi couples . He needed a few peaceful moments in the clear night air to try to make some sense out of this weird world into which he had been set , much against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his better judgment too . He had been walking through the Old City of Zylong , whose narrow streets followed the paths of the first settlers and whose low buildings commemorated the era before skyscraper apartments . At the end of the street leading to the  | bridge , he saw the glow of the great Central Plaza . Drinking in the colors and sounds , he had ambled across the plaza , filled with elegant , brightly dressed bodies , walking , talking , lotting at tables , listening to strolling musicians . Their voices were soft , their manners discreet , their greetings to him elaborately civilized . His host and hostess saw no problem with his " taking a bit of air , " though they only dimly knew what he meant . Zylong City at ten-thirty at night was a pulsating , shining , glowing place . Seamus drank in its charms  --  which included most notably the greatest collection of shapely female forms he had ever seen . It was a great place , it was .. . with the most lovely women in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as lovely as the fair Marjetta , whom he had alas not set eyes on since the fruit-nibbling preprandials . If only they were n't spying on me ... Then the lights flickered , warning the folks to go home . Without reluctance or protest the crowds slipped away and left the center of the City deserted in less than a quarter hour . Then the lights went out , leaving Seamus alone , or so it seemed , in the total darkness , broken only by the frail light of one of several tiny and unimpressive moons . Alone except for the spies . He frowned at the black waters of the stream . It looked pretty deep . Of course they were n't telling him the truth . Or rather they were telling him so much which was true that he was not really getting the truth , not even the truth of why they were so eager to give him a crash course on Zylongian life . Somewhere something was very wrong . Again , the twitch in his neck . Damn it , still no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said in Spacegael . There was no one willing to respond . Back again to the flowing waters . Deep and rapid , doubtless some kind of sewer . I 'd sure hate to get pushed in . In the morning everything had been straightforward . Technical Institute , Computer Institute , Body Institute  --  he  | got the full official tour of each one . t le saw the great Central Plaza with the sprawling complex of Central Building , computer center and military headquarters . He walked some of the curving little streets of the Old City behind the plaza . His questions about politics were answered in great detail : they were governed by an elaborate structure of Committees that made all the decisions at every level in the society ? unanimously , he was assured . He had to ask very few questions . Most of his queries were anticipated . Someone had sent the word to tell him everything  --  so much of everything that he would be drowned by detail . If you keep pointing out the technical name of each tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest . He had heard everything and learned virtually nothing . At the sternly antiseptic Body Institute with its pastel green walls , O'Neill was surprised at the relationship between Samaritha and her staff . He expected the Director of Research to be stiff with her juniors , but she actually unbent and relaxed . Her gang seemed to like her ; their banter was mild compared to what went on aboard the Iona , but in this uptight place it was almost disrespectful . She actually smiled once or twice , even managing something which by Zylongian standards must be considered a laugh . When she laughed , the urge to hug and kiss her was strong again . He had to watch himself . The Zylongi , he learned from the doctor and her staff , lived in close harmony with their environment . At the time of the Reorganization , it had been determined that population expansion was to cease and that the rest of the continent would be left to its natural inhabitants . Jarndt , their main crop , was the source of their food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City provided them with materials for their buildings . Research was required merely to develop new and drought-resistant forms of jarndt and new techniques for exploiting its bounty and , in Samaritha 's case ,  | ion the better understanding of the inhabitants with whom Ihvy shared the planet . All reasonable enough , he supposed , until they got to the frenetic engineering part of the story . Young people were mated in infancy after a computer examination of their genetu potential . Random mating , he was told , was undlyciplined and socially dangerous . The Body Institute staff were astonished that O'Neill was pledged to no one and that it he wished to marry , he could choose anyone he wished . After the Body Institute , Samaritha walked with him to the Music Center , where he was to listen to her husband conduct a rehearsal . He sensed disapproval and anxiety in her tense , voluptuous little body . " You truly have no pledge to a woman , Poet O'Neill ? " she asked dubiously , a frown on her face . " Does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually manage to keep my animal instincts under control , though it 's hard when I 'm walking with beautit ul women .... " Her frown deepened . " You must try to understand our culture and not to dislike it , " she said primly , ignoring the compliment . She said a formal good-bye to him at the entrance to the Music Center and turned to walk back down the street . Seamus enjoyed the sight of her swaying buttocks as she melted in with the crowd . Lord save you , man , she 's twenty years older than you . He still watched until she was lost from sight . He thought of her swaying body again as he watched the sewer water glide swiftly by him . The Central Plaza was as dark , according to the Taran saying , as a Cardinal 's heart . 1 le should hurry back to the living space . They might worry . Sammy and Ernie were merely doing their duty of hospitality . They had been told by the Committee to provide him with answers to all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were either afraid to know or too wise to ask . Did they know about the shadows that had been on him all day ? Probably not . For Sammy it was essential that he  | not only know the answers to questions he really had not got around to asking but also that 1w accept the wisdom of Zylong 's cultural decisions . Did that mean she had her own doubts ? This time he was sure he heard sounds in the street . Still no one there . Sammy was a true believer , though ; her husband apparently less so . " My mate is a virtuous woman , " Music Director Ornigon had said that day . " She is not able merely to explain and accept , she must also defend . For an Honored Guest , that can be tiresome . " Again there was a deep tinge of melancholy in this gifted man 's voice . O'Neill observed that such a splendid woman could never become tiresome . Ornigon continued . " The Honored Research Director has been very popular since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a scientist , I think . As an artist , I may be excused , perhaps , for being more cynical . " He shrugged his shoulders ruefully . It was after the rehearsal , a mechanical Haydn played with instruments that looked like caricatures of the symphony instruments he knew . The horns , violins , even the wind instruments were almost half again as long as they were in the prototypical Taran orchestra . There were also a couple of super bassoon-type things that made a deep and haunting sound . O'Neill and his host stood on Reorganization Bridge watching the fading sun color the big stream scarlet as it rushed through the City toward its confluence with the great River in the midst of the vast sandy banks beyond the walls . They sipped companionably from a container of la-ir that Ornigon had managed to find in a back room of the concert arena . " Is it true that mates are chosen here by a computer ? " O'Neill asked , leaning casually against the bridge . " Oh yes , it is true . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species , save perhaps in some physical  | ways . I do know that it produces certain divisions in our pociety . Mates are chosen according to principles which lead people to mate within their own groups . Thus the Honored Doctor and I are both from families of important people in 11w country . Our son 's mate , the Military Student , is the daughter of important officials . The goal of a society without classes seems to be in conflict with the goals of a genetically Improved society . " He spoke gently , but the empty paper container crumpled in his hand . " But how does someone like Dr. Samaritha explain that conflict ? " O'Neill drained his paper cup and filled it again . " She says that our society exists in its essence during the planting and harvesting of the crops  --  which reflect our origins , after all . The Festivals that come after are times when we return to primitive equality . Whether that satisfies those who think we have rigid social division and that they are the victims of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Committees have thought so ; one hears very little complaint . Of course , those of us at the top would not complain , would we ? " He shook his head negatively to Seamus 's offer of more drink , noticing with surprise what he had done to his cup . " Social divisions ? " O'Neill asked , not bothering to hide his curiosity . " A small matter . " His host regretted his quiet outburst almost at once . " It is rarely discussed . " O'Neill emptied the container into his own cup and glanced at the glorious skyline . Heaven save us , it is beautiful . Not worth the price that 's paid for it , but still beautiful . A pastel symphony against the serene blue sky , much softer and more flexible than the concert piece he had heard . Who was in charge here ? What shadowy forces if any made the real decisions ? On the Iona , you knew what the factions and the parties were and who dominated the Captain Abbess 's council this year and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Subprior and whom to see when you wanted something done . But here it was impersonal ,  | mysterious , secret . " Committees , " " Guides , " " computers " ? Nonsense . Someone had to be in power . Did n't they ? Or could a cultivated civilization become so rigid and so old that no one was in charge ? At least a third of the recycling units did not seem to work and two of the streams were bone-dry , their artificial stone beds harshly stained in the sunlight . They would be repaired " shortly , " he was told . But the word sounded more like an approved cliche than a confident assertion that the repairmen were on the way . One of the two lifts in the Ernie/Sammy skyscraper would also be fixed " shortly " ; but when he demanded how long it had not worked Seamus learned that ( a ) he should not ask such questions and ( b ) for several months . " The Repair Committee is very busy . There is much to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand must wait patiently . It serves no purpose to complain . " Which O'Neill interpreted as meaning that the efficient Samaritha wanted to complain and repressed her urges , even to herself . In a society with the wealth and resources this one possessed , there was no reason for anything breaking down for a long period of time . Save for bureaucratic incompetencies , about which Seamus had read , but which , heaven knows , he had never experienced in the small contentious world of the monastery . If the repair crews did n't show up in fifteen minutes , you sought out the responsible person and posed numerous questions about his ancestry , his sexual preferences , and the advisability of propelling him instantly through the space lock into permanent individual orbit . He responded in kind but then came with his surly crew and did the job ; after which , a bit of the drink was always happily taken . No waiting for months . " Does the computer decide when you can have children too ? " " Pregnancies are authorized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after careful tests do  | they approve it . The most any family is permitted is three pregnancies ; the normal is two ; many have only one . Sometimes none are authorized . In addition there is a test the infant must pass to qualify for life . Should he fail , he is disposed of . It is very difficult to get permission for a replacement pregnancy . " Ornigon paused . " We had a second child . . . a daughter . . . she had a slight defect . . . . " Brusquely he added , " It was a pity , but there is a social cost in such defects that a society like ours simply can not afford . The child would not have been happy in any case . " " Is this same thing done to old people ? " O'Neill inquired , beginning to suspect why he had seen so few . " All careers are ' terminated ' at the age of ninety  --  about seventy-two of your years , I understand . It is possible to apply for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , termination orders are issued before the officially designated date . You wonder how we ' terminate ' careers , but you are reluctant to ask ? " O'Neill nodded , draining the last drop of la-ir and hoping his own horror did not show . " Well , at Harvest Festival , " Ornigon explained , " they ' go to the god . ' They become one with Zylong . " " Human sacrifice ? " O'Neill gasped , his own paper cup now crumpled into a tight little ball . " It may have been once , Honored Guest . Now , of course , we are too civilized to do such a thing . It is all quite painless , not frightening at all  --  an easy way to end one 's career . At least it is said to be easy . We have no testimony from those who have been terminated . " Noticing that O'Neill was gripping the bridge railing tightly , Ornigon smiled wanly . " You are shocked at our customs . They are perhaps different from yours ? Our motives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of society . It is always said they would not be happy alive .... " His voice trailed off . The two of them silently watched the sun disappear from the sky . Later that night , leaning on a smaller bridge over the swiftly moving sewer , O'Neill thought that there was much  | repressed cruelty in this graceful and cultivated civilization . But it all seemed to work . There was no reason why everyone in the cosmos had to be Celtic anarchists like the Tarans. t le turned away from the bridge to begin his walk back to the living space , hesitating as he tried to figure out which direction he should go . Yes , there was . The Tarans were crazy , but they loved kids , even handicapped ones , especially handicapped ones . And they treasured the old for their wisdom and their storytelling and their goodness . It 's not just a difference of opinion , he told himself firmly . These folks are civilized and we 're barbarians , but we 're right and they 're wrong , damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too late . A foul smell filled his nostrils as a dirty rag was pressed against his face ; hands were grabbing at his shoulders and ankles . Violently he thrust the hands away , but they persisted , slowly dragging him to the ground . He felt nauseous ; his strength was failing him . His head spinning , consciousness slipping away , he tried to continue his struggle , but his muscles grew lazy and sluggish . He was roughly hoisted to the rail of the bridge and pushed . He floated in space and then abruptly hit the water . It was cold and dirty . A sewer indeed , he thought absently as he went under . He made a vague effort to swim , but his lazy body dragged him under again . He surfaced once more , one hand grasping for something to hold . It hit a projection on the stone riverbank . He clung to it . The current ripped at his arm , tore him away from his grip on life and bore him under in the darkness . His head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted to pray . A hand grabbed his arm , a firm strong hand . He yielded to its strength . In total darkness he was pulled to shore , hauled laboriously up on the bank , forced to stand on unwilling feet , and then , smelling of sewer , dragged into a building , up a short flight of stairs , into a room . He collapsed on a hard bed .  | After a time he opened his eyes . The room was a yellow blur . The sickness was passing . The effects of the drug wore oil quickly . That way they do n't find any traces in your body . " Our la-ir is too potent for you , Taran Visitor , " said a woman 's voice reprovingly . Ah , it could n't be herself now , could I it ? Was she the guardian angel the good guys had sent to protect him ? " La-ir , hell , woman , " he replied weakly . " I was poitoned . " He tried to focus his eyes . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptically , " how interesting . " ' T was indeed herself . Seamus Finnbar O'Neill 's heart began to beat rapidly . He opened his eyes . The room was small , barrackslike in its simplicity : a bed , on which he was sprawled , a chair , a table , a video screen , a small bathing pool , lemon-colored walls , diffused light . Somehow it was an intensely feminine room , in part because of the intensely feminine presence in it . " I should at least know the name of the lovely lady to whom I owe my life , " he said , rubbing his aching head . Strong brown eyes regarded him critically . " You know very well who I am , Visitor ; you made a fool of yourself ogling me at the Research Director 's living space . I am Lieutenant Marjetta of the Zylong army , Visitor . I 'm not sure your life is worth saving . " " Well , " said Seamus weakly , " ' t is yourself that 's worth ogling . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that it makes any difference to me . " She had already tossed aside her robe . Now she slipped a practically invisible zipper and discarded the top of her lentat . Ah , that 's how they work , in two parts , is it ? He also settled the critical issue of his daydream world about the most desirable variety of breasts ; in this area too , the exquisitely flowering Marjetta was perfection . Quickly , but not rushing , she slipped into the pool . " I do n't care whether you wish to continue to smell like a waste- disposal unit . If you do n't , you may use the pool . You will not disturb me . " " If it were the la-ir , " Seamus defended himself , " if I 'm drunk , how come I 've come out of it so soon ? " " Come here , " she ordered briskly . He obeyed , as he would a command from the Lady Deirdre , with whom she could fairly be compared , Seamus realized with a touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet and stumbled toward the pool . She had sunk low enough into its opaque waters to serve the basic requirements of modesty but still suggest enough womanly attractiveness to threaten his selfpossession . She peered intently at his eyes . He tried to look innocent , though his heart was beating rapidly . Dissatisfied , she pulled his head toward her face . " Let me look at you . I 'm not going to rape you . Hmmm . So it would appear that you were assisted in your evening swim . That is no concern of mine . " She released his head and sank lower in the water . Despite her words , she was puzzled and perturbed . Maybe she was only a chance , not an official guardian angel . " So , as I suspected , the Fourth Secretary did not find your god legend amusing . " " It was him , was it ? " She shrugged her strong shoulders indifferently . " Who else has power in this chaos ? There are others who might have done it , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If you stay in our city long enough , you will learn of them . " " Maybe it would have been safer for you just to have let me go under , " he said , probing for her reaction . Her brown eyes turned hard with anger . " Do n't be absurd . I am commissioned to protect life .... " She hesitated , wondering perhaps who had other designs . " Poet O'Neill , for so I am told you are called , you smell of the foul stream . Would you please remove your garments and step into this  | pool . I will look the other way while you undress , lest I offend your strange outworld prudery . After I have bathed , you will remain here , looking at the wall , while I dress . Then I will leave the room while you do the same . Then I will escort you to the living space of Samaritha and Ornigon . " " Sure , in my condition , even your great beauty would not stir me up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slipped into the pool , careful to stay as far away from her as he could . Still , his eyes sought out her breasts , just beneath the level of the water and not altogether invisible . She gripped his shoulders and turned his face firmly to the wall . " You will do as you have been told . " No sense of humor at all . He was still dazed . He tried to think it out . His body ached . " Ah now , ' t was a very fortunate thing for me , was n't it , Lieutenant Marjetta , that you just happened to be coming down the street when I was going under , " he remarked amiably to the wall . The discreet splashing of water at her end of the bathing pool stopped . " You 're quite right , Poet O'Neill . I might also have been the one who pushed you in . You will just have to take the chance that I am not , wo n't you ? " The voice was firm but not hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still dizzy . He clenched his fists , grimly determined not to look away from the wall . " You 're a terrible woman altogether , " he complained , causing another laugh . She 's enjoying this . She 's got me in an awkward and embarrassing situation and loves every second of it . " Well , just for the record , I want to say thanks for saving my life . It may not be all that much a life ? " a plea for pity " ? but it 's the only one I have . " " It is indeed not much of a life , to judge by the reports about you , which I do not altogether believe , " she said in a terse , hard voice , " and all I did was my duty . I would do it for anyone . " Then the voice softened , becoming almost maternal . " Still , I accept your gratitude and am happy I could  | save your life . You are not ? " she gave a small , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sewer . " There was a splashing noise indicating that she was climbing out of the pool . Seamus did not dare look . " This cloak will probably cover you adequately until we return to the living space of the Research Director . " She threw a huge brown sacklike garment on the couch . " It is a mountain robe . It may be a little warm , " she actually giggled . " But you do not come in any of our regular sizes . Now I will leave the room , so as not to offend your male prudery . " Silently and unsmilingly she left . After O'Neill , thoroughly humiliated , had dressed , they left her room and walked down the steps . A cruddy old place for someone like her , he thought . Then without reflection he muttered the age-old Gaelic benediction . " Jesus and Mary and Brigid be with this house . " " Who are they ? " Marjetta demanded . " Ah , holy people . " " What does that mean ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but in the darkness she sounded like she did not . " Your god has special friends ? " " Well , kind of . We pray to Him through them . We sort of hope they 'll use their influence with Him . " " How consoling . A kindly god then ? " " Sometimes too kindly by half . Wo n't leave us alone . Head over heels with us . If you take my meaning . " " Extraordinary . And yet somehow not unreasonable . I should like someday to know more about him . It is him , is n't it ? " " Sometimes , " O'Neill answered . " Well , the Old Fella has the characteristics of both . " " You do not deceive me ? " " Why would I do that ? " She conducted him back to the quarter of his hosts . They said not a word to each other till they came to the small parklike plaza in front of the Sammy/Ernie skyscraper.  | " Thanks again . " l le reached in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What nonsense is that ? " she demanded imperiously . " You 've saved my life , so I am , uh , well , not in debt to you ? " he searched for an explanation " ? but , well , at your service if you ever need me . " " That is very beautiful , " she said , her voice choking up . " I may well need you . And I will call upon you gladly . " Now that was a change of tune , O'Neill thought uneasily . " How can I help ? " he asked spontaneously . " No one can help . " She sounded close to tears . Then they were , unaccountably , in each other 's arms , locked in as furious an embrace of love as O'Neill had ever known , her breasts pressed against his chest , his hands digging into her rump , their lips glued together , their bodies twisting in the preliminary motions of passion . His cloak fell off him , her robe slipped away with a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in resistance . " Please ... , " she begged . O'Neill was an expert on no 's . This was a real no , reluctant , sad , but definitive . She did n't expect him to honor it , which was , his instincts told him , all the more reason to do so . It would be much better eventually when she said yes . Besides , the pavement was awfully hard . Then in an instant Seamus Finnbar O'Neill discovered what love was . Her fragility became more important than his passion , her fears more important than his need . His lips and hands became instruments not of conquest but of reassurance , his embrace not an imperious demand but a tender offer of protection , his kiss a delicate and sensitive tribute to her goodness . She melted in his arms . He released her . She leaned against him for a few seconds and then pulled back . He reclaimed his coat and her robe in the darkness and arranged the robe around her trembling shoulders . " You stopped , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " " Most men would n't . It was my fault . My emotions are more undisciplined than I thought . Now I owe you a favor . " " Do n't mention it . " " You may be a space parasite , Poet O'Neill , but you 're still a good man . " She paused . " And a fine lover . " " I 'm flattered . " He tried to laugh . " At least I think I am . " " You kiss Dr. Samaritha that way ? " she asked curiously . " I 've never kissed anyone that way in my life . " " Why not ? " " I 've never quite loved anyone like I love you . " When we finally know what love is , the Cardinal had often said , we know what God is like . " Now I am flattered . But enough . I must take you home . Here is my hand , " she laughed , " for guidance purposes . Follow me . " His heart sang within him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to be saved from this terrible place and he was the man to save her . " Poet O'Neill found our City so fascinating that he became lost , " she sternly told the four people who were anxiously waiting , Horor , the slender , intense son , and Carina , the diminutive hard-faced future daughter-in-law , having joined his host and hostess . The kids were impassive ; Ernie and Sammy were obviously relieved . " You folks certainly provide charming guides . " He smiled expansively , going along with Marjetta 's lie . " A happy event which brings the good Lieutenant to our living space , " said Sammy warmly , taking the girl 's hand . Everyone in the room seemed delighted by the trim soldier 's presence , the young people especially . For a kid not yet twenty , she was very well known . Ah , woman , I 've got to get to know you better . Still he was more than a little afraid of her . She was almost as tough as the Lady Deirdre . Come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to kill me and why ?  | When she left the apartment , she said , with a glance at O'Neill , " Jesus and Mary and Brigid be with this house . " They stared at her in astonishment . " It is one of the Poet 's blessings . " She permitted herself a small smile . " Friends of his god . I find it consoling . " Glory be to God ! Later O'Neill was luxuriating in the fragrant waters of his bath . The jungle smell that filled the room had chased the last memories of the drug and the sewer . The Zylongi were bathing freaks , worse than the Tarans , if that were possible . Even the Technical Student  --  in whose quarters he was staying  --  had a vast bathtub , set into the floor , in which many-colored pulsating waters created a feeling of deep tran , juillity . Then he thought about the simple almost harsh quarters of the Lieutenant . Not everyone was equal in this world , not by a long shot . He splashed some water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasizing about the long trim legs of Lieutenant Marjetta . His door panel slid open and Dr. Samaritha entered . " I am concerned about your health , Honored Guest . " She leaned against the door , slightly and becomingly out of breath . Oh Lord , now two women on my mind . " Not a thing wrong with me , " he boasted . " Just a long hard day in the most pleasant possible company . " Dr. Samaritha smiled . Then she asked , " Honored Poet Guest , may I ask you a question ? " O'Neill nodded . She blurted out , " Do I displease you completely ? " " Of course not . What would make you think that ? Sure , I doubt any space tramp has ever had a more gracious and considerate hostess . " He again splashed his face with water , trying to hide his unease . " Poet O'Neill , you are a strange man . Sometimes you joke , sometimes you say improper things , sometimes you are kind and considerate , sometimes you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most disconcerting . " Where was a muscle in her throat that twitched bewitchingly . She was at her best when she was vulnerable . tie pressed his hands against the bottom of the tub to restrain his impulse to jump out and embrace her . " Well , lovely women always throw me off balance , I guess . Besides , sometimes I get the impression there are many things I do n't understand . " " Must you understand everything ? " she pleaded , extending her lovely arms . " It is not too good to be too curious . The Music Director and I intend you no harm . You should allow us to please you . But . .. I have said too much . " She turned and fled , as though some emotion were too powerful to contain . LIh , oh , O'Neill , you may just he in really serious trouble . You 've been here a couple of days and already you have two beautiful , vulnerable , fragile women on your hands . This was n't supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | The next day O'Neill was to hear , much to his disgust , substantial clinical details about the fragile and vulnerable Doctor Samaritha  --  Sammy  --  in bed . Only she was described more like a beast in heat than a woman who needed to be treated with the utmost tenderness . He and Ernie were " engaging in exercise " in a local " exercise " center . He did very badly in a kind of team handball  --  a melee in which every man was for himself . Though he was a halftoot taller than the Zylongi males and thirty pounds heavier , they were in much better condition and more agile than he . Every muscle ached  --  too much dark cream and la-ir , he judged . The locker-room conversation afterward was a shock . All five of his fellow exercisers had made love to one another 's wives and all felt free to discuss it . Their collaborative description of Sammy in advanced stages of passion revolted 1 him . They made her sound like a sow , a grunting , howling , disgusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , heaven knows . And Seamus was not above engaging in it , all the time wondering what the conversation was like in the women 's locker room  --  and never of course having the nerve to ask . It became pretty clinical and explicit at times , but while it treated women like things ( something a Taran male would do in the real world only at peril to his limb and life ) , it was not deliberately cruel and it would certainly never be done in the presence of a woman 's husband . The Tarans , in their own bumbling , incompetent , shy , 89  | and often prudish way , liked women , enjoyed them , feared them , worshiped them , and more or less respected them . The Zylongi men seemed to hate them with a pent-up rage and frustration which suggested that sex was messed up more on this planet than even among the Tarans , where it was , Seamus thought , notably messed up . One of the Zylongi , with an uncharacteristic bluntness , asked for details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed about sex on Tara than on Zylong . " I can make love only a hundred forty times in twentyfour hours , so you can see my romantic life is quite undistinguished . " He saw a flicker of amusement on Ernie 's melancholy face . You do n't like this custom either , but it 's too strong for you to fight . Later he and his host were sitting at a sidewalk cafe eating the wafers that were supposed to be lunch . Ornigon began somewhat hesitantly . " I am very sad , Honored Guest , that our conversation this morning upset you . If I had known , I would never have permitted it . Surely you understand that in every society there are traditional ways of expression that hide as much as they reveal . It would be a mistake to take those ways of expression as literal truth . " " Ah , it 's a powerful passion , sex is , " Seamus agreed tentatively . " It 's lots of fun , but it can get out of hand , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ornigon replied evenly , " sex is limited to the Planting and Harvest Festivals . If it happened at other times , it would destroy us completely . It is difficult even then . We have special energies during the Festival ; even so , the business is greatly wearing . " Seamus held on to the table . His head was spinning . Glory be to God , he could n't have said what I just think he said , could he ? " You limit sex to two months a year  --  at the most ? " he asked , his voice tight with the effort to keep it under control . Ah , that would be worse than being a monk . Altogether .  | " It is our way . Obviously , it has its limitations and ... uh ... frustrations . " The man gestured nervously with his thin expressive hands . " The Guardians thought it was the proper method for maintaining the ideals of our society . Our fertility should come only to celebrate the planting and after the harvest is reaped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one of your acuteness has doubtless noticed . " When the ancestors of the Zylongi came here from Earth , they were utopian communitarians , firmly opposed to marriage , pledged to " complete sexual accessibility . " However , in the pioneer years of clearing the jungle , fighting the hordi , planting the crop , building the earliest city , permanent pairing began to reemerge . It was convenient on the scattered pioneer farms and outposts . There was evidence that such tendencies began to develop on the space flight that brought them here . " Logistically and emotionally it seems to create less strain , " Ornigon said , his voice tinged with its frequent melancholy . " Women are reputed to favor it more than the men at first ; later , men came to find it more convenient to be concerned with only one woman . " To maintain the illusion that the ideology was still being honored  --  and ideology has always been important to us ? " Ornigon emphasized , " there was a period at planting time and another one at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sexuality . Onemonth periods for the release of tension  --  something like the Carnival or the Oktoberfest on ancient Earth . Also it likely served a superstitious function of blessing the fertility of the fields . However , with the passage of years , the Festivals became quite tame until the time of Reorganization . " The Guardians were faced with a dilemma . The primitive practice of universal sexual accessibility had to be honored , yet the disruptive social impact of random coupling was intolerable . Since they were also committed to genetic engineering , they could n't allow unplanned pregnancies . They limited the expression of sexuality to the two months  | of Festival  --  just after planting and just after harvest each year . For the first fifteen days of each period , coupling is indiscriminate ; the second fifteen days are limited to couplings of mates . Pregnancies , to be ' valid , ' must occur during the second period . For the rest of the year , the irrationality of sexuality is not permitted to interfere with the running of an orderly society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Festival , and then only until after the mating ceremony . Some cheating is possible , but offenders are punished severely . " " Those Festivals must be something else . " O'Neill shook his head in wonderment . " They are , Honored Poet , very unusual times . Some look forward to them with great longing . " His face now a tragic mask , he shook his head sadly . " It is a period when many energies that are pent up are released . In that release there is satisfaction and pleasure ; often it is violent and irrational . We exhaust ourselves physically and morally . Few are sorry to see the Festival end . The Festivals vary from year to year  --  sometimes they are especially terrifying . In recent years they have gotten worse ; it is as though we are demons . I think something else besides sexual hunger takes possession of us . There are those who understand such things who contend it has something to do with the physical effects of harvest . A biological reaction to which we have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And no one cheats ? " He considered O'Neill very carefully . " What do you think ? " O'Neill thought of the two overwrought women the night before . Of course people cheat . " Well , you said that you are severely punished if you 're caught . " " To my knowledge no one has been caught in my lifetime . " " Ah . Then I 'd say there are ways around the rules . " " Dedicated citizens like my wife would tell you ?  | officially , I assure you  --  that no one breaks the rules . The cultural controls are strong enough that no one talks about It . The pretense is maintained . Perhaps it always was merely pretense . Yet it is a powerful conviction in our society . So it is necessary , even if there is cheating , that we maintain the facade of obedience . As to how much occurs , I can not say . An elaborate nonanswer worthy of a Taran , worthy indeed of an Abbot . He had said that he and Sammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that either . How could you live with a woman like that and not .. . Still , the norms of a society , he had learned in the monastery school , can impose almost any kind of behavior . " I suppose that in recent years there has been more cheating ? " O'Neill asked cautiously , thinking of those who were listening up on Iona , now probably with open mouths and incredulous faces . The Tarans might be messed up on sex and they might not know quite how best to do it , but they certainly did it a lot . " Everyone says that our society is deteriorating . I suspect that it is said always . I am not skilled enough to understand these matters . I direct music , as you no doubt have perceived , somewhat woodenly . I do know that when the Research Director and I were promised but not publicly mated , it would have been unthinkable for any of our group to think of sex with our promised . Today , I understand , such practices are widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they were strong in our time too . I am convinced that Horor and Carina have performed the act together . For my wife it is impossible even to consider such a possibility . " You got all that down up there ? You should have sent a monk here instead of a twenty-five-year-old bachelor with a wild imagination and a horny body . Your Ladyship can take me out now . He did n't expect a reaction and sure enough there was n't one .  | That evening the three of them were sitting quietly , listening to a new Bach recording made by Ernie 's orchestra . O'Neill was deep in thought . Enough of the pieces were fitting together . Repression , license , then repression again . Strong social bonds , weak personal freedom . Yet the individual personalities were sharply etched . Ernie , Sammy , the handsome and enigmatic Marjetta were not merely cogs in a vast social wheel , nor docile ants in an ant hill . Your Blessed and Holy Eminence , I have n't found out anything yet that you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be something else that I 've missed . Still , how do you like the part-time celibacy ? Would n't work at all among us , now , would it ? Besides , they 're still shadowing me , if I 'm to believe the twitching in my neck . " Were you pleased with Officer Marjetta ? " Samaritha interrupted O'Neill 's thoughts . " Yes , indeed . She seems to be a very competent and intelligent soldier , " O'Neill said noncommittally . Speaking of celibacy , was I ? And herself brings that one up . " She is very independent , " added Ornigon . " Too independent for many . Her delay of the mating ceremony with Captain Pojoon has upset many people . Captain Pojoon could seek destruction of the agreement , and that would be very bad for Lieutenant Marjetta . Ways can always be found for the aggrieved party to find another mate , but the offending party will not be allowed to mate . Such people often leave the society altogether rather than suffer such disgrace . They are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and Ornigon had no intention of telling him any more . " Does n't she . . . is not the Captain pleasing to her ? " he asked , trying to sound innocent but his heartbeat picking up . " She says he is very pleasing , " Samaritha answered disapprovingly , " but that she is not yet ready to mate . He can not be expected to wait until his career is terminated . " Her frown suggested some deep unease . They listened in  | Silence to what Seamus thought was a very dull Second Branndenburg . As the last strains of the music died away , Samaritha stirred restlessly on her couch . " Is it now permissible to ask him the question , Honored Mate ? " " If you wish , " said Ornigon , somewhat nervously , turning off the switch on their sound system . " If it gives offense , Honored Visitor , we will talk of other things . My Honored Mate and I have noticed that sometimes you call us by strange names . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me ' Sammy . ' Ornigon says you have called him ' Ernie . ' You even addressed the excellent Marjetta as  --  I believe the term was ' Marj ' ? " " Margie . " " We are curious as to why you do this . " " Ah , well , but they 're nothing but little nicknames . Why was that so difficult a question to ask ? It 's a short name we Tarans use with our friends  --  a sign of friendship and affection . Sure it means no harm at all . " Strange to see , Samaritha was weeping . " Poet O'Neill , how is it possible for you to consider us friends ? You hardly know us . " She sat up on her couch , leaning forward so that the tops of her breasts were distinctly visible . She was intensely interested in his words . " Maybe we mean different things by ' friendship . ' I mean ... well , someone you can trust when the lights go out is a friend . " He was stumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had blundered into . The barroom reference was no help . Both husband and wife seemed baffled . Seamus tried again . " A friend is someone you can be yourself with , someone from whom you do n't have to hide and who wo n't let you hide when you try . Sure , it 's nothing more than a cliche I learned in school . " Extraordinary , " murmured Ornigon . " It means much the same to us , I think , although we would not put it so well . My mate and I are overwhelmed that you think of us  | this way . We were mates for many years before we became friends .. . it was not an easy struggle ... . " " How can you see all the anger , ambition , and selfish ness which makes me such a vile person and still want me for a friend ? " Sammy demanded , tears streaming down her face . The situation was getting out of hand . Dear God in heaven , and I wondered whether these two loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Running on pure instinct , O'Neill rose from his couch , his fists shoved together to keep his own emotions under control . " Damn it , Sammy , where I come from , " he said gruffly , " if a beautiful woman speaks that kind of nonsense , you take her in your arms and hug and kiss her until she laughs it all away . " She lifted her head slightly and looked at him with liquid brown eyes . " If I may , " said Ornigon , deeply moved himself , " we have an approved , though perhaps not so satisfactory a sign as the ' nickname ' or ' hugging ' or ' kissing . ' One extends one 's fingers like this . " Ornigon reached out toward Samaritha , who extended her hand toward his . " The friends touch like this . " Ornigon and Samaritha gently touched fingertips , then intertwined them slowly . It was a painfully beautiful moment . They then extended their free hands toward him , forming a circle of friendship . Later , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten himself into . His neck twitched . There was no one at the door . Damn , I hope you folks up there are protecting me . Hey , are you responsible for that girl being on the bank when I drifted by ? That was a nice thought . But what am I going to do about these two ? Sammy and Ernie 's literal-mindedness led them to treat his casual use of the word " friend " as something of immense  | Importance . There was so little friendship here on Zylong that it was a desperately serious thing . They were now deeply Involved with him . He was systematically deceiving them about who and what he was . On both Zylong and Tara , you were not supposed to deceive your friends .  | Slowly , with dignified and solemn rhythm , like a Corpus Christi procession , the crowd moved down the narrow old street . Hundreds of portable lanterns in the hands of devout worshipers cast an eerie light in the predawn darkness . A hell of a way to go to church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not like a procession in the monastery , however . There was no center to it , no Blessed Sacrament to be carried , no Abbot or Prior walking at the end , no acolytes or thurifer in front . The crowd simply formed and processed on its own , as though it were animated by a single soul . They loved processions and Holy Days on the Iona . Festivals broke the often monotonous routine of the space pilgrimage . But Tarans were quite incapable of spontaneously forming themselves into a procession or a festival celebration . Someone , normally the Ceremonialist , had to make plans and give orders . Even then , and even with the cool eye of the Captain Abbess watching every move , the processions were likely to be ragged , chaotic affairs . When Tarans were having fun , they were quite incapable of self-disciplined ritual dignity . So Seamus thought that the early morning ceremonies in the great City were just a little bit creepy . No , more than that , they were creepy altogether . It was Zylongday  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were three weeks , he had learned , to the month , ten months to a year , so you multiplied by 0.8 to get an Earth estimate of Zylong age . Sammy had said it would be thought " strange " if they failed to honor another day of worship .  | here was , she said , no obligation , but people were expected to go to religious service at least several times a year . Since she and her mate had major responsibilities in the society , it was their custom to go to the " Worship Plaza " just behind the Central Plaza rather more often . O'Neill understood . It was expedient not to break long-standing patterns . The Committee tended to " notice " such things . Whoever the Committee were . Approaching the main Worship Plaza ( other smaller ones were scattered throughout the City ) , O'Neill saw that the square was elevated five or six steps off the ground . In the center of it was a large translucent globe that emitted a soft glowing light . In front of the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a few wisps of smoke could be seen . It was into that pit that people " went to the god " at Festival times . Probably some kind of natural underground thermal activity beneath parts of the City caused the smoke . Perhaps the pit contained quicksand . Sacrificial victims sufficiently tranquilized would go into the mud without protest . Since the god was equated with the planet  --  as well as the society  --  sinking into the earth could quite literally be thought of as " going to the god . " Those who died of natural causes before their careers were terminated were thrown into the hole at a private funeral . As the Worship Plaza filled with people , the light from the lanterns shone against the plain white worship togas worn by the assembled congregants . Each person held a little cup of something that looked like wine . A deep chime rang out once just as the first light appeared in the sky . Complete silence fell on the crowd . Lights began to flicker and swirl within the globe ; a line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe from one side of the plaza . They moved slowly , murmuring a chant that increased in volume as the worshipers began to respond . This antiphony of " priests " and " congregation " grew louder and louder , gaining in intensity of rhythm and emotion .  | No , I do n't like this at all , at all , Seamus told himself . I h'r Ladyship would be profoundly offended at what they 've dome with the memories of our liturgy . After each verse they sipped at the little cups of liquid . Seamus managed to spill most of his . In the darkness , no one noticed . The light in the globe changed colors rapidly . The singing , the lights , the swaying motion of priests and crowd were hypnotic . O'Neill struggled to maintain his equilibrium . The strange liquid , even in small amounts seemed to be more of a liquor than a wine  --  sweet and soft . It had a powerful and immediate effect . Ugly images raced across his mind ; he was hard put to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iona blowing up , the Wild Geese being slaughtered , the Captain Abbess being destroyed by a satanic serpent , rape at High Mass in the chapel , inundated him . Then , replacing all the others , an image of God  --  nothing . For a few desperate moments that seemed like the whole of eternity and more , these terrifying pictures became the only reality in his existence . They were true and nothing else was . He fought to break from them , but they would not let him go . They absorbed his mind , permeated his imagination , filled his soul . It was the end of all he believed in , all he wanted , all he was willing to die for . For several terrible seconds he was captured by a compulsion to dash up on the worship platform and throw himself into the pit of fire , to obliterate himself as all his hopes and loves had been destroyed . Then the full rays of the sun flooded the plaza . It was all over . There was a loud exclamation of joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of Mass . They began to file out of the Worship Plaza , just as calm and normal as when they came in , chatting pleasantly with their companions . If anyone knew they were in a druginduced ecstasy , they did n't show it . Whatever it was , O'Neill realized , its effects subsided quickly . Sweating and trembling still , O'Neill puzzled it out : if you 're not sensitized to the stuff , it 's an ecstasy of terror . Maybe  | It 's like that for the others , too , and they 're so used to it that they do n't notice . Maybe it 's like hitting your head against the alloy wall of the monastery . It feels so good when you stop you do n't remember what the pain was like . " Is it not a beautiful and refreshing ceremony , Honored Friend ? " asked Sammy briskly , as they threaded through the crowded streets toward their tower . " It is so peaceful . You an . at one with Zylong , with your family , your friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what everything means and how tiny you are in that meaning . " She seemed in fine fettle . ( Just like Deirdre on Sunday morning . ) " What does everything mean ? " he asked innocently . " It is inexpressible , Honored Friend , " responded Ernie . " Perhaps you have to be a Zylongi to understand . " There was an unexpected benefit of Zylongday . Ernie referred to it as a " mild diversion " for a Zylongday afternoon . To O'Neill it was a picnic . After the worship service the City atmosphere was relaxed  --  a holiday spirit pervaded the air . Small wandering bands and orchestras played in the plazas and the squares . The sidewalk cafes were crowded . Streets were filled with people in brightly colored clothes , strolling together and chatting . Whatever was in the " communion " drug seemed to relax the formality and tensions of Zylong life . His hosts were more cheerful than usual . Sammy hummed a tune as she bounced around the living area preparing for their " diversion . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wall , she changed to another tune and compelled O'Neill and Ernie to hum with her . The woman 's idea of " short " was not the same as Seamus 's . After the first half hour he began , Taran-like , to complain . " You are young enough to be my son and strong enough to be a god . " She poked a finger at him . " Stop your complaining . " " I 'll complain as much as I want , woman . " Seamus put his hands around her waist , lifted her into the air as if she was a child , and spun her around , shouting and sputtering ,  | and then , when he thought she 'd had enough of her carnival ride , deposited her unceremoniously on the ground . Frnie and the other folks walking toward the wall seemed to think this was hilariously funny . Taran savage doing his Zylongday thing . Sammy was red-faced , dizzy , flustered , and exorbitantly pleased , truly the little girl-child he had for the moment made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strange things . " " You keep a proper tongue in your head , woman , " he laughed at her , " or I 'll do even stranger . " Everyone thought that was uproarious too . " Well , you need complain no longer . " She was breathing deeply still , wonderful breasts moving up and down rapidly . " We are almost at the wall . " " ' T is the walk home that worries me , " he protested . " We will ride home , Honored Guest . " Ernie did n't quite understand.it was mostly a game . " Almost " meant fifteen more minutes on his now aching feet . He complained . Sammy made little faces at him but did not take the risk of another ride . Too bad , he 'd enjoyed it . Ah , sure nothing but a harmless little game , he told the Lady Abbess , just in case she was listening . The wall of the City was what Ernie called a " symbol , " a waist-high slab of gleaming pink alloy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mills of the spanking-clean factory center which O'Neill had visited earlier in the week ) . Panels swung open when you touched them . In time of conflict an electrical energy was released to make them effective barriers ; now one could easily leap over them  --  which he did , to the mingled dismay and amusement of his hosts . " When do you shoot the current through it ? " Seamus tried to sound innocent . " In times of conflict , " Ernie said calmly . " And when do you have conflict in this well-ordered and peaceful place ? " His hosts were silent .  | " We do n't , of course . " Sammy began to walk along the wall , not looking at him . Her husband followed as he usually did when she led . " It is merely a precaution , " her husband added lamely . " Ah , indeed . " Seamus lifted his picnic basket , the heaviest because , as Sammy had explained , " you are by far the biggest , " and followed along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening in the wall , at which two sleepy cops with rusty pikes stood guard , they entered a blockhouse and descended by elevator to one of the huge underground chambers that lay beneath the City . It was the the end of a monorail line . Next to the terminal there was a garage filled with the small electric cars that scurried through the City . Ernie 's status entitled him to the use of a car . He handed a token to the bored attendant . After trying two cars that refused to work , they found one that , with considerable effort , was persuaded to sputter into action . The bowels of the City , Seamus noted before he was distracted , were also the seamy side of the City . The obsessive cleanliness that was required aboveground did not seem necessary underground . The monorail station and the car park were littered with torn scraps of paper and unidentifiable rubble and permeated with a strong smell hinting broadly at human sewage . The monorail that arrived just as they were leaving seemed to limp wearily into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Seamus took to be the late arrival of the train . Underground you do n't even have to be patient and polite : even mine host and hostess are churlish with this dummy that ca n't find a car that works . Then came the distraction . Seamus saw the Lady Deirdre herself get off the monorail train . At least It looked like her , a tall , slim woman with black hair tinged with gray and a thin ascetic face , gentle yet determined . Like Marjetta might appear in , well , fifty years .  | Before Seamus could be certain , the woman slipped away in the crowd . It could n't be her , he told himself uneasily . Just my guilty conscience . Yes , it could . You know very well that like some of the other " sensitives " up there , she can project an image of herself that is almost as good as the real thing , almost anywhere she wants . Is n't she after doing it for laughs on the great festival days ? And is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing down here ? Spying on her spy , you idjit , what else ? And why does the Lady Cardinal remind me of Margie ? Because they look a little like each other , you idjit , even if you never noticed that before . " Is there something wrong , Honored Poet ? " Sammy asked anxiously . " Ah , I thought I saw someone I knew , but sure it could n't be ? " " The Honored Lieutenant Marjetta ? " " Not exactly . Someone maybe sixty years older . But sure it was n't her at all , at all . " She does n't have lithe swelling breasts like my Margie . Well , not that I 've let myself notice anyway . And herself a Cardinal . The car started then , and they chugged up the ramp , out an opening beyond the City walls . " The day is so pleasant , " Ernie said , a broad smile on his face , " that I thought it would be diverting to leave the City . " The air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun a deep , rich rose . The scent of flowers was everywhere . Since there were n't any in sight , the odor must come from the low grasslike plant that grew on the narrow plain which ran between the City and the great River , beneath the sweeping sandbanks that were upriver from the City . It is not paradise , but it will do . Sure , it could n't have been herself . You have a guilty conscience , that 's what you have .  | I have n't done anything to be guilty about . Not yet , but you 're fixing to . Their car actually was a small hovercraft , bumping along On d cushion of air . Its motor needed a good tune-up . Doubtless the Repair Committee had assigned it a priority . Well , if b breaks down , I hope they do n't expect me to fix it . I 'm a poet , Not a mechanic . Of course , the woman could have something else going on down here besides me . Maybe I 'm a pawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've known that you were a pawn from the beginning , why let it upset you now and ruin your day ? The woman was up to no good , you can bet on that . They sped over the plain to a small gravel beach on the riverbank . The Island ( it had no other name ) lay in the River , roughly parallel to the City , perhaps two miles from it . So that 's where she wants to land , is it now ? Well , it 's not a terrible bad place , I suppose . It sure beats the blackness of hyperspace . Despite the beauty of the afternoon , there were only occasional small groups of Zylongi wandering around on the plain or sitting at the edge of the River . They seemed to keep close to the City walls when they ventured out for their Sunday , oops , Zylongday , picnics . Their hovercraft left the bank and sped across to a small cove on the Island . It was unusual in the topography of Zylong  --  a low mountain rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some five miles long , it had hills , valleys , some flat meadows , tiny forests , creek beds , and wide orange sand beaches on every side . No , it 's not bad for a monastery at all , at all . Why do n't we just take it over ? We can tell these folks that the red-bearded god took a fancy to it . " May Jesus and Mary and Brigid be with this island , " Sammy said devoutly as they climbed out of the rickety hovercraft . " What did you say ? " Seamus could hardly believe his own hearing .  | " It is your blessing we learned from the f ionored Marjetta , " Ernie remarked apologetically . " You are distressed that we use it ? It is sacrilegious ? " " Ah , no , " Seamus sighed loudly . Sure I should have thought about blessing the future site of the Iona . " The question is whether they would object , and they 're a lot more tolerant than we are . " It is beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah , lots of them , too many altogether . " They swam in the warm , buoyant River , drank la-ir in copious amounts , ate the nameless delicacies that Sammy had prepared , and lay on the soft sand . O'Neill had a hard time keeping his eyes off Sammy since she handed him her toga almost the moment their skiff pulled up on the beach . The scanty lentat merely emphasized her seductive charms . Sammy was richer and fuller than Marjetta , though not so perfectly sculpted . Marjetta 's athletic grace challenged you , Sammy 's flowing figure invited you to the warmth of earth . Sure there 's room for both , is n't there ? Near nakedness for her culture meant only friendship ? before the Festival anyway ; she seemed to feel no shame lying on the hot sand , her heels digging little holes in the beach , between her husband and her friend , both of whom were as unclad as she . Ernie went for another swim . " Do you find my body pleasing , Honored Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been staring too intently . " I find you pleasing , Sammy , " he replied truthfully enough . He wondered what Marjetta would look like in a brief loincloth and banished the image . It came right back . " As always , you speak the beautiful and the mysterious . " The grip of her fingers tightened . " You are far behind in your kisses . " " What do you mean by that ? " He wondered about pulling his fingers away .  | " You said that patients and doctors exchange kisses twice a stay . " " 1 never did . " " At the Body Center , you most certainly did . " " Ah , but that 's our custom , not yours . " " It is a good custom . " " I like this one better . " He repeated his spin-the-dollyIn the-air routine . Kissing , he decided as he whirled the delighted Sammy above his head , might be safer than this . Sure she might just as Well have nothing on at all . So he laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kissed her lightly , twice for good measure . O'Neill decided he needed a swim too . When he returned , his friends asked if he would permit them a brief stroll down the beach . " I think I might take a wee nap . " He yawned and stretched . " The woman wakes me up while it 's still dark and now makes me hike halfway across this planet . The least she can do is let me catch forty winks . " That should convince them that I have no idea they 're going off f somewhere and breaking the rules , the dirty things ! " Forty winks ? " Despite the softness of anticipation in her eyes , Sammy had to ask the question . " An idiom for a brief rest . " Sure I 'd never have thought herself would break the rules . I bet they have n't been doing it for long , either . Do you have to come over here or do you risk it late at night in your tower ? He was willing to wager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights went out , just like everything else . The Guardians probably did spot checks of bedrooms to keep everyone honest . You took your chances of ending up in the fire on Zylongday when you made love , so you did it rarely . But you still did it . There were probably a lot of things the Committee did not want to know , because it could n't do anything about them anyway . Sammy and Ernie , however unsuited for each other they  | may have been when they " officially mated , " were now , it seemed obvious , deeply in love with one another . How could anyone expect them not to play with each other 's bodies ? He had learned in the monastery school about the Shakers , mostly because they composed such wonderful songs . Despite their music , they did themselves out of existence because they believed in celibacy not only for monks  --  which Seamus supposed was all right as long as it was your vocation , God knows it was n't his  --  but for married people too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakers and no more songs . They probably did shake because of the way they lived . It 'd be enough to make anyone shake . The songs were joyous enough , though , were n't they ? He hummed " Simple Gifts . " And then sang it for his hosts . They loved it . He taught them the words in their own language and they sang it with him . " It is indeed a gift to be free , " Ernie sighed wistfully . " A great gift . Almost as great ? " he took her hand " ? as a good wife . " Sammy blushed happily and clung to his hand . " We must take our walk now , Honored Poet . " " Have a nice walk . " Seamus could have kicked himself for that smart-aleck crack . They both blushed and turned away . So you can live like a Shaker if you have to and want to and your society and culture make you . Yeah , but most people ca n't . But they 've been doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . All right , so it is possible . But it 's silly . Since Seamus was an orphan , Carmody had provided him with his sex instruction  --  God knows the monks would n't mention a thing like that . The Brigadier was a good teacher . It was said of his wife , Maeve , that she became more beautiful each year and , with a knowing wink , " You know what that means ! " The power of sexual attraction , Carmody had explained ,  | Is that it keeps man and woman together , even though " they have no business trying to live in the same house and sleep in the same bed . Can you imagine a more difficult thing for two human beings and themselves as different as can be ? " Seamus admitted that he could not . " And sure , " the huge , grizzled Brigadier went on in his rich mischievous baritone , " just when you 're ready to murder the woman and long after she 's made up her mind to poison your coffee , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in all God 's world . " That seemed reasonable enough . " ' T is just like God feels about us , " Carmody observed , echoing the theories of Cardinal Deirdre , after he had laid out some of the more graphic details for a fascinated Seamus . " Ah , He 's not that way at all , at all , " Seamus protested . " God is a spirit . " " Are you letting those gombeen men in the school teach you that nonsense ? Whoever said spirits do n't have passions ? God is daft over us . That 's what herself means when she preaches that marriage is a sacrament  --  it gives us a hint about what God is like . Sure , He 's even more crazy in love with us than we are with one another when we 're turned on . " " Go ' long with you , " Seamus said , dubious but delighted . " If God were like that , well ... " " Would I be misleading you now ? " Carmody had demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God ? ' T is a nice idea . I 'll have to tell Marjetta the next time I see her . She seems kind of interested in our god . And when will I see her again ? It 's all right for the two of them to go sneaking off into the woods so they can lollygag with each other . Here I am , an enforced celibate , and myself not even a monk . The Tarans did not try to regulate the sex lives of their members . " We did try long ago , " the Abbess said crisply , " and it did n't work . "  | Premarital experimentation was frowned upon officially , but when it happened , there were sighs and comments like " Ah , the boys wo n't leave the girls alone . " Or vice versa . " The blood is hot at that age , " the Abbess would say . " And ' t is herself that would know about it , " some of her contemporaries would mutter behind her back . Extramarital sex was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close quarters of a spaceship monastery on a pilgrimage that could last for decades . Men and women knew this and generally avoided complicating their own lives and other people 's . Not that nothing ever happened by way of adultery , but the participants were careful not to get caught . And when they were caught ? " Sure they would n't have been caught unless they wanted to be , " the Abbess would complain  --  the emphasis was not on punishment or retribution but on " working things out . " Not that the Tarans had figured out how to make sex work . " The species has never done that at all , at all , " Carmody complained . " But at least we do n't have too many hang-ups and some of us ? " he smiled complacently " ? even manage to be good enough at it to enjoy the game now and again . " " Do you now ? " Seamus decided that he would be one of those . If only he could find the proper woman . Which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expected . Until the shapely shoulders of Marjetta had thrust themselves into his life . Shapely and strong , he thought , remembering ; after all , she pulled me out of the sewer . Sammy and Ernie came back , arm in arm , glowing with satisfaction and complacency . So they , too , were good enough to enjoy the game . Good for them . Seamus pretended to be asleep so as not to embarrass them . Or himself . Finally , he made a great show of waking up and , without looking at them , announced that since he 'd been promised  | that he would not have to walk back to the tower , he would exhaust himself altogether with one last swim . The sun sank slowly into the horizon beyond the towers of the City , bathing it in gold and purple . The long haze of twilight settled peacefully on the River and the Island . After what must have been the fifth swim and their tenth round of la-ir , O'Neill and his hosts were collapsed in satisfied exhaustion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good Friend O'Neill , we must ask you another personal question . " " All right . . . I guess , " he agreed reluctantly . " You ask it , Gentle Mate . I have already said too many impulsive things . " She dug her tiny heels more deeply into the sand . " We like the ' nicknames ' you have chosen for us . What do your good friends on Tara call you ? " the Music Director asked hesitantly . Images of Tessie and Fergus Hennessey flashed across his memory . " Ah , well , I suppose you must know that my very best friends , the people I grew up with , call me ' Jimmy . " Sammy clapped her hands . " Geemie  --  what a marvelously funny name . Oh , it is perfect for you . " Maybe by the end of these holidays all Zylongi get a little slaphappy . The day was over . Reluctantly " Geemie " and his hosts gathered their clothes and their picnic equipment together and lumbered their way back toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robe . She smiled a bit wickedly , for her , as she slipped it around her body . " Yes , I must wear it , but modesty is tiresome with one 's friends , is it not ? " Glory be to God , can you imagine what would happen if I said that up there ? He muttered a prayer to his patron St. James ( the Greater , of course ) that it really was n't herself lurking over at the monorail station . Not that there was any way of hiding from her when she wanted to keep her eyes on you . They were late returning to the City . Sammy and Ernie ,  | perhaps reluctant to face the rigid , formal style of their City life , delayed on the riverbank , treating each other with exaggerated gentleness . O'Neill supposed he should have been embarrassed . That Sammy and Ernie could turn the words of ordinary conversation into caresses did n't seem to fit the Zylongi personality . By the time they got to the garage , the attendant was gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seamus was so sleepy from the exertions and emotions of the day that he paid no heed to his hosts ' nervousness as they waited for the monorail to respond to their signal . An ugly , hoarse cry ; then O'Neill felt his arms pinned behind him and saw a knife slicing toward his throat .  | Seamus was out of condition , weary from the day 's exmime , and long unpracticed in the skills of hand-to-hand combat . On the other hand , in addition to being a perhaps second-rate poet , he was one of the Wild Geese , the most respected warriors in the galaxy . " We Only Fight When We t lave To " was one of their many mottoes . And another was " Do n't Make Us Mad . " Well , he had to fight now . And he was very mad indeed . These shitheads had been sneaking around behind him long enough . He quickly shifted his shoulders , ducked the knife , twisted it out of the hand of his assailant and threw him into the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , Seamus heard a sickening thud . Ah , that 's the end of him , poor fellow . The second one rushed at Seamus with a big vicious pike , aiming straight at his chest . Seamus ducked . The man turned , backed him into a corner , and charged again . Seamus had no choice but to plunge the knife into his heart and twist it out again savagely . That was that . In less than half a minute , two black-hooded figures were dead on the station platform . O'Neill , panting for breath , stood over them , a knife dripping with blood held tightly in his hand . These idjits with the hoods made the mistake of taking on someone trained to kill if he had to . Sammy was screaming . Another hooded figure had her pinned to the wall , and a fourth had torn off her robe . Ernie 113  | lay unconscious , his head bleeding badly . O'Neill kicked an oncoming Hooded One in the stomach and sent him sprawl ing against the monorail car , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grabbed the two who were assaulting Sammy and cracked their skulls together . A quick knife thrust at the reviving attacker and there were five dead bodies on the platform . Ernie was still unconscious ; Sammy 's back was pressed against the wall , her body shaking with shock . O'Neill grabbed her by the shoulders and yelled , " You look at Ernie , I 'll find the police ! " Sammy willed herself calmer . " No , not the police . It will be the end of us all . You must do exactly as I say , Geemie . I will explain later . " She bent over Ernie , touched his head , lifted his eyelids . She steadied herself against O'Neill 's arm . " It is bad , Geemie . If I do n't get life serum he will not survive  --  my beloved . Quick , or he will die ! " They pried open the door of the monorail car and lugged Ernie inside . They propped him up in the seat behind the control panel . " They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think I can make it start . Get rid of those monsters . No , bring them on the car . And clean up the floor . " " Yes , ma'am . " Seamus hopped to it , as he always did when a woman gave an order . He dragged the five Hooded Ones into the car , used the remnants of Sammy and Ernie 's clothes and a spray container from the station wall to clean up most of the blood , and buried the blood-soaked garments in the bottom of an overstuffed trash container . Inside , Sammy was desperately pushing at buttons . O'Neill watched helplessly . Ernie was hardly breathing . A goner , Seamus thought to himself . Then the lights went out , the vehicle leaped forward . " I think I 've turned the override key for emergencies , " she shouted over the roar of the lumbering train . " It will take  | the car directly to the Body Institute ; no other station can stop or divert it . " " Is n't that nice now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dimly lit stations , until it swerved to the left off the main line and entered the Body Institute 's underground complex . Using manual controls , Sammy guided the car through a number of sliding doors that opened automatically when it approached . When they stopped , Sammy jumped out into the darkness and pressed a button on the wall . A panel slid aside to reveal a large , low-ceilinged chamber illuminated by a pale green light . Save for a walkway around its perimeter and what appeared to be a loading platform in front of the door , the entire room was a vat of thick , slowly bubbling liquid . It had the hideous smell of death . Sammy did n't hesitate . " Quick , Geemie , our lives are lost if anyone sees us ! " She began to pull one of the Hooded Ones toward the seething rolling substance . Seamus tried to remove the hood ; she stopped him . " We do not want to know who they are . That would be too much . " As the first body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured the disintegration of skin over muscle , muscle over bone , and the skeleton itself in the caustic action of the acid . As each body followed the last , the vapor rose higher . When Seamus dumped the last body into the vat , the surface was frosted by a thick layer of sickly greenish cloud . Sammy rushed around the edge of the vat to a panel halfway across the room , exclaiming , " I 'm going to get serum for my mate ! " O'Neill spent interminable minutes in the dank underground chamber directing prayers to Yahweh , Brigid , Patrick , Columcile , Finnbar , James , Brendan , Kevin , and any other Celtic saints who might have been listening , sparing just a few moments to point out to Yahweh 's local representative , Deirdre Cardinal Fitzgerald ( a title to be used only when one  | wanted special psychic assistance ) that help in this particular instance would be most appropriate . No answer from any of them . Ernie 's eyes flickered dangerously ; his slight breathing became more labored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sammy returned breathless with a large syringe in her hand . She plunged it into her mate 's chest . O'Neill watched anxiously as the fluid level went down . Sammy listened to his heart , her ear pressed to his chest . Seamus could see the movements in Ernie 's thin brown chest slowly become more regular ; the blood which was still reddening his iron-gray hair stopped flowing . Sammy stood up . " He lives , Geemie , " she said wearily , and collapsed sobbing into O'Neill 's arms . Slowly and gently he caressed her to peacefulness . After a moment 's relaxation , she dashed back into the chamber and pulled out fresh robes from a closet . Sammy quickly and skillfully guided the monorail car back into the main tunnel . So the Honored Poet and his hosts returned to the livingspace complex after a pleasant if slightly prolonged Zylongday outing on the Island . " A small accident with the car , " Sammy explained to a station attendant as they helped the now conscious but groggy Ernie out of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is well that the trains run this late on Zylongday , " he replied with mild reproof . As they left the elevator , Sammy muttered , " He will report us , of course , but no one will know what happened . " Lots of spies around this place , are n't there ? Later , in the privacy of their living space , while his mate began her ministrations to his skull , Ernie painfully filled O'Neill in on their attackers . " The Hooded Ones , " he said , " are not the same as ' those who are no longer with us . ' They are anarchists , not dissidents . They rarely appear in the daytime , although they have been seen more often at that time recently , it is reported . They attack after dark , then usually  | only isolated individuals or small groups like us . Recently the attacks have been both more vicious and more frequent . Their attacks are usually on the fringes of the City . Tonight 's attack , so near the main gate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after midnight because they fear attack . We ere late coming back ; still , it was before midnight . " Those who are no longer with us , mused Seamus . There 's ore damned categories of baddies around here than a poor space rd can keep straight . " Why did n't we go to the police ? Why were we so afraid ) f being seen ? Why did we cover up traces of the attack ? s if we were guilty ? " O'Neill was baffled . " The Hooded Ones , " said Sammy , carefully stitching her ate 's wound , " do not exist officially . Some of them may ive as ordinary citizens during the day , but many more live n the caves beneath the underground system  --  which also ? o not exist officially . It is not wise to talk about what does of exist in public . If one reports an attack from something that does not exist , one is causing trouble for the City . If the police are forced to encounter something that does not exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will ikely end up in a vat like the one you saw . Geemie , we came very close to being there ourselves tonight . I was running down a corridor in the Body Institute with the life serum when something seemed to tell me to turn into another corridor . It was lucky I did . There was a police patrol in the first one . Now , beloved , the stitching is over . " She touched his face with gentle affection . Seamus took a blind-leap guess . " Are the Hooded Ones the same as the Guardians ? " Sammy paused with a medicine bottle in her hand . Ernie spoke : " We do not think so , although it is said that the Hooded Ones think of themselves as ' Guardians of the Next Day . ' Of the ' New Reconstruction . " " Do they now ? "  | " Still , " added Sammy , " they might occasionally cooperate  --  especially if there were a plan to eliminate an intruder who was no longer welcome . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernie very slowly . " Not at all , at all . "  | Seamus O'Neill , carbine at the ready , prowled the low hill just above Captain Pojoon 's encampment . There was no moonlight yet , only shadows against the stars . It was like blundering through the storerooms in the deep hold of the Iona , except that the only folks who lurked there were ghosts , so there was nothing to be afraid of if you did n't believe in ghosts . The " carbine , " as he called it , was a light weapon which fired electrical charges that were strong enough to kill you if they hit you in a vital spot , not nearly as deadly as the automatic weapons or laser rifles the Wild Geese carried , but deadly enough . Seamus , of course , did believe in ghosts , but not in the same way that he believed in enemies lurking in the hills behind them . Ghosts could scare . The folks up in the hills might kill you . The Zylongi were too inept to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a proper system of guards . What a rotten bunch of soldiers . Herself was right : this society is falling apart . Sure they need help bad . And if it 's all the same to you , now would be the time to come and help them . And meself in the process . No word back . Not that he expected any . They 'd forgotten about Seamus Finnbar O'Neill . The woman had other irons in the fire . So they 'd sent him on a suicide mission ? Well , Seamus always was a good one at taking care of himself . He would have to assure his own safety . The camp was a few feet below him ; he could barely see the outline of the small tents that housed the troops . He 121  | yearned for the silver light from the tiny Zylong moons , billiard balls that bounced fretfully across the sky . The horses were invisible beyond the camp , but he could hear the nervous stamping of their hooves . Everyone but two guards was sound asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . An exposed camp with no pickets and no preparations for defense . " There are no dangers here at the foot of the mountains , " Pojoon said casually . " It is better that we get some sleep for tomorrow 's march . " Marjetta had no word of disagreement . Her attempts to turn the ragtag band of adolescent recruits into a marching column were cautious and discreet ; she did not want to embarrass her future mate by suggesting in front of the Honored Guest that he was not much of an officer . Pride , woman . That 's what it is . The terrible sin of pride . The sin of Eve . No , he got it wrong . Who was it that was guilty of the sin of pride ? He could n't quite remember . Well , it does n't matter . Pojoon is a bum . No match for Seamus O'Neill at all , at all , even if she pretends I do n't exist  --  and bad luck to her for doing that . He considered carefully and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck to the poor girl . Sure , she 's had more than enough bad luck for one life . O'Neill had tried to sleep in the stuffy little tent , but his psychic sense and trained military brain told him that tonight danger was very near . He did n't have much psychic ability , but at least he could sniff danger . " A very useful trait in a Commandant , " the Lady Abbess had said dryly when she gave him his gold oak leaf badge of office  --  to be worn next officially safe or not . If an attack came , he would be ready for it , no matter what they did . Save Margie if no one else . Every noise among the rocks , every shift in the slight breeze increased his nervousness . He fingered the illumination grenade he had stolen from a store 's tent ; he hoped it worked . The carbine that Marjetta gave him when  | they were switching from hovercraft to horseback at the edge of the desert was old but well maintained . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined it ; it would work well . She wo n't look me in the eyes . Is she after blaming me for what happened that night ? Sure she was into it as much as I was . Seamus cautiously reopened the weapon to make sure it was not jammed . The woman told the truth . Sure she 'd be a good housewife , too , much better than those slatterns up on the Iona , worse luck to them for leaving me down here to be murdered in this terrible desert . Well , when whatever was going to happen did , he was n't going to have a jammed carbine on his hands . The Zylongi troops were young , most of them new recruits . Many had never been on a horse ( not that he had ever ridden one either  --  St. Patrick , how he ached ! ) . They could n't maintain a line of march for more than a half hour ; they had a hard time setting up their tents ; they went to bed even though they were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save their lives  --  which they might have to do . Washouts , Seamus suspected , that the high command wants to eliminate . Along with Honored Poet Seamus Finnbar O'Neill , God be good to him . They had left the Military Center , just down the street from the main square of the City , while it was still dark , arriving at the departure station at dawn of the second day . Though all the baggage had been prepacked , it still was well into midmorning before Pojoon , Marjetta , and Retha , a frightened little-girl Cadet who looked like she was about eleven years old , managed to get the horses loaded . They proceeded out the Gate of Departure in something less than a trim line , with a small chorus of lame farewells from the garrison sounding behind them . They would not make the trip to Fort Hyperion by hovercraft , first because there were only a few such vehicles and  | secondly because none of them had the range required for the trip to the other end of the World Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He suspected that those who ruled Zylong wanted to keep control of all the long-range transportation on the planet . The ride across the desert was hot but uneventful . By sunset of the second day , the weary and dispirited troopers arrived at the foothills of the vast mountain spine of Zylong . They saw the snow-capped peaks at the lower end of the chain far off in the distance . Although sunset behind the mountains was glorious , O'Neill paid little attention since he was preoccupied with the hapless efforts of the three officers to get their expedition settled for the night . They were not much of a command staff  --  a stupid Captain , a Lieutenant preoccupied with problems of her own , and a terrified girlchild Cadet . Seamus wondered who she had offended . If the Committee were sending out an expendable expedition , they did n't have to make it so obvious . Of course , they did n't know they had a Commandant of the Wild Geese on their hands . Or did they ? The heat lessened as dusk settled . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wraparound robe on desert marches . While it protected one from sun and sand , it gave little freedom of movement in a fight . These folks know nothing about fighting . Then why have an army ? O'Neill left his cloak in the tent and went out to prowl in his lentat , a knife stuck in its belt . The moons began to edge over the horizon . Marjetta was so unlike Samaritha . The latter was tense and businesslike on the surface but warm , sensuous , and yielding underneath . Margie was apparently pure rock all the way through , though delectable rock . There must be some kind of military tradition in Zylong . She was every inch a sophisticated , tough , and resourceful soldier  --  high-quality officer material even by Wild Geese standards . He wondered what she thought of her own army .  | The first news of this trip to the desert came two evenings after the fight at the monorail station . Seamus was trying to talk with the young serving hordi . She could understand him , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , however , she found him hugely amusing . " You admire the good Dr. Samaritha ? " he began the conversation . The little creature clicked and grunted enthusiastically . " All these people ? " She shook her head in a vigorous negative . " Uh-huh . They kind of push around your people , do n't they ? " The small one looked anxiously to either side , bowed her head and clicked once . " The day of the hordi will come , wo n't it ? " The servant chattered with terror , pointed at him , and ran from the room . The legend again . Why is she afraid ? Of course , when the wild hordi come in from the desert , it may be rough on the collaborators . This scene gets worse and worse . The normally dormant video screen in his room crackled and came alive . There was Marjetta on the screen , looking coldly at him . " Poet O'Neill , " she intoned , " the Committee thinks it proper to offer you the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior officer , Captain Pojoon , will lead a convoy there in three days . It should give you an opportunity to observe the countryside of our planet before the time comes for you to leave . Will it please you to accept the invitation ? " It did n't please Poet O'Neill very much at all . The Committee was serving notice on him that his days on Zylong were numbered . Also , it was sending him out on a dubious expedition only two days after someone had tried to kill him . The Committee was issuing an order , not an invitation . If Marjetta noticed his suspicion about the journey to Fort Hyperion  --  Odd name . Greek , was n't it ? ? she did n't com- ment on it . " You will come to the Military Center tomorrow at the third hour after the zenith and ask the guard to conduct you to my office for a preliminary briefing . Try to be punctual . " " Bitch , " sighed O'Neill , as she signed off . " But so lovely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the invitation . He found her reading on a couch in her own room , the water steaming in the bath next to her . O'Neill was still not able to get used to seeing the good doctor naked to her flat luscious belly . Every time he saw her he felt he wanted to run  --  though he was n't quite sure whether to run toward her or away from her . Her body invited him into the depths of her selfhood , an invitation that attracted and frightened him . She luxuriated in his admiration . " Ought not one to enjoy friends ? " she had asked him once with a mixture of naivete and coquettishness . " Is there something wrong with me , Geemie ? " she asked , putting aside the book . " Uh . . . no , nothing at all . " If only his eyes would n't widen embarrassingly every time he saw her . " Come , Geemie , " she said invitingly , extending the tiny fingers of her right hand , " join me in a serenity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're afraid of me . You must know me well enough to realize I would do nothing improper . My mate himself suggested that you might need the relaxation . " She peeled off his robe and led him unresisting into the warm waters of the pool . " Is it really true that on Tara you hug friends instead of holding their fingers ? It would surely be proper for you to hug me , would it not ? " She laughed merrily and put his arms around her . She fit nicely ; there was surrender in her body . Glory be to God , Deirdre , the woman 's trying to seduce me ! Though there was no reply from Deirdre , Sammy was n't trying to seduce him . The serenity bath had the same effect as la-ir . It produced intimacy from which all passion was drained . The temperature of the bath varied subtly , shifting  | patterns of coolness and warmth over his body  --  passion fulfilled rather than passion aroused . One more of the Zylongian techniques for sexual control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were filled with tears . " Musha , now , " he said . " There 's nothing to cry about . " " Why do n't you take Marjetta with you and leave this planet ? Go back to Tara . Have a life of joy and peace with your own people . " She buried her head against his chest . " Well now , to tell the truth , that 's not a bad idea , but I do n't think the young lady would be all that eager to step into my battered spacecraft . Sure , the old Dev is not the sort of thing to attract a woman with a career ahead of her like Marjetta . " He did n't want to get mixed up with that one . Besides , had she dragged him into the intimacy of her bath to sell Marjetta ? " No , you are wrong , Geemie . She will go with you . I know she will . You two would be very happy . You would find love much younger than I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go soon . " She dug her fingers into his arms , desperately pleading with him to leave . While she spoke to him urgently , she was holding his head on her breast , gently stroking his hair . The rest of the universe slipped away ; there was only himself and this beautiful woman who had admitted him into the sanctuary of her love . He touched her face ; the jaw muscles were still stiff , but under the gentleness of his fingers they became soft . He was falling , falling back into childhood . He was a little boy and she was a tender and loving mother . On the low hill in the desert , O'Neill realized he was perspiring despite the cool night air . There had been no aroused passion while he was in her soothing embrace but the memory of it made his body twist in pain . I am going to pieces . Wild Geese do not fantasize about women when they 're on battle alert . There was a sound down the hill from him . Instantly he  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone sliding into the plain . The plan for the journey to the desert was straightforward . A transport column of forty rather stodgy horses ( their ancestors , probably not thoroughbreds to begin with , must have come here with the original settlers ) and twenty soldiers with supplies would be conveyed to the edge of the jungle beyond the cultivated region by large transport ( bigger versions of the hovercraft on which he had been brought out of the jungle ) . They would move out across the desert to the mountain foothills , following them around to the fort on the southern tip of the continent . There they would unload the supplies , rest for a few days , collect the concentrated minerals used in alloy construction , and retrace their route home . The whole journey would take no more than two weeks  --  three at the most , should there be storms on the desert . Which was the first O'Neill had heard of any storms . Podraig , you goofed again . The trip could be completed several weeks before the harvest . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but capriciously limited its technology . On the one hand it used computers that were as good as any on the Iona , and provided electricity for the City from an old-fashioned nuclear reactor in the Energy Center ; it could produce an elaborate monorail system inside the City and alloy metals , rock-hard , for buildings and walls . But it brought in raw materials and supplies on horse-drawn carts . The only large hovercraft , capable of any distance , belonged , he had been told , to " the Committee " and was used only for " official purposes . " Ernie explained that it would " violate " the harmony of the land to use big machines outside the City . The explanation was delivered in what Seamus had come to recognize as the " civic " tone of his host 's voice  --  a tone reserved for the " party line , " which the good Musical Director did not necessarily believe . Seamus guessed that banning technology from the coun- try kept its resources under control of the Committee and protected ordinary Zylongi ( For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) from contact with the wild hordi or the other " monsters " ( Carina 's word , spoken in the only sentence that Sammy 's sullen little future daughter-in-law had spoken to ( ' Neill ) who lived in the wilderness . " And Narth ! " the angry little child had added . " Who 's he ? " She shook her pretty head disdainfully and walked to her impatiently waiting young man . The day after the " invitation " he went to the Body Institute for inoculation against diseases on the trip . The Zylongi had brought disease under control in the area around their City and in the cultivated region ; in the desert it was another matter . Sammy was very businesslike . She had no idea what the diseases were ; the Inoculation Department was not connected with hers . Their research was not published . Still , everyone knew the serums were very effective . There was no need to worry about infection on the journey . " Do people like you and Ernie really like the Festival ? " he asked abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence mission . " Do n't you hate sharing your mate with others ? " Sammy turned her back and put one of the bottles of vaccine into the refrigerated wall safe from which she had taken it . She stood ramrod-straight . " Of course we hate it . Do you think I like to feel the crude hands of the workers paw me ? Do you think I enjoy those foolish young women ... who take my mate ? It is unbearable . It happens . There is nothing to do . The Festival is part of our culture . It is in our bodies ; we are prisoners to it . We must endure it . " She whirled around , her eyes blazed with fury . " Are you satisfied now , Seamus O'Neill ? " she screamed at him . " Do you know everything about us that you wanted to know ? " Relentlessly he probed on . " Then the time you have with one another during the second half of the Festival must be  | very unsatisfying . People like you and Ernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I bet you break the rules no matter how virtuous you claim to be . I bet you broke them the night I saved your lives down in the underground . " She threw the empty syringe at him and ran sobbing from the room . Seamus sighed . Well , it does indeed look like they are coming apart at the seams . I hope you folks up there with Her Ladyship are happy about finding that out . I hate myself for doing it . Sammy and Ernie were mournful when it came time to say farewell . " They can not do it , " she wailed . " We had an agreement .... " " They can do what they want , my dear , " Ernie replied grimly , wiping his hands nervously against his robe . " You know that . " " Ah , do n't be after worrying about me . " Seamus waved his hand airily . " Sure this space tramp can take care of himself . Why did I ever tell you about what happened in the bar on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went off on another one of the stories , utterly fictional , like the one with which he had calmed his friends after the rumble in the monorail station . " You certainly displayed your ability to defend yourself the other night . " Ernie raised his la-ir glass respectfully . " I was not , ah , in a condition to observe , but from what my Honored Mate tells me , you are not without warrior skills . " " He is a fearsome fighter . " Sammy eyed him keenly . " Are poets also warriors in Taran culture , Geemie ? " " Not at all , at all , " Seamus lied flatly . " I 'm not much of a fighter . You should see our real warriors . They 're called Wild Geese . There was a time when one of them and I were in a tight spot on Kerry and ... " So it went . He had been quickly forgiven for the scene in the Body Institute . Sammy embraced him fiercely and kissed him passionately when she dropped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gone three weeks , ( , ' eemie , I will owe you sixty kisses when you return . " " At least . In our culture , the rate goes up when the patient is away from the doctor . " She does n't believe , she never did . She merely likes to kiss me . Well , is n't that interesting . His reflections were abruptly ended when he realized that a grimly frowning Marjetta had watched the farewell embrace . Well , it 's your own fault , woman , for not staying in your office , like you said you would . He covered up his embarrassment by striding over to the younger woman and demanding the " truth " about the dangers in their trip . " There are no dangers . " She would not look at him . " It 's a routine mission . " " Wild hordi ? " " Some . They are not a threat . " " How many ? " " Officially there are only a couple of thousand of them in the whole world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He grabbed her arm roughly . " I want the truth . " " Most of them are unarmed and afraid of us . " She wrenched away from him . " I suppose that there may be tens , even hundreds of thousands of them , but they are not dangerous , save to cowards who are afraid of the child 's tale that they eat humans . " " And monsters ? " " Who has been talking to you ? " she glared at him contemptuously . " A few harmless mutants . " " Armed ? " " A couple of old-fashioned weapons . " " Zylongi ? " " You have no right to question me , Poet O'Neill . I will protect you . Let go of my arm . I thought I made it clear that I found physical contact with you distasteful . "  | " That 's a new song . " " Very well , there are some exiles out there and some descendants of earlier civilizations . I do not discuss such matters . Now if you 'll excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " " He does not exist . " She turned on her heels and strode away . All of it , Seamus told himself that night in the desert , while he tried to guard the camp , was lies . She had lied to me and did not even bother to hide the fact that she was lying . Lulled by the images of two beautiful women , O'Neill dropped off to sleep in a small ravine on the hillside . Something like an alarm bell sounded in his head . He woke with . a start and threw the illumination grenade . The scene that was revealed in the split second before he began to fire the carbine was like a stop-action film . The hordi band and their Zylongi allies were caught just after the moment of attack . The startled aborigines , clicking and grunting in terrifying rhythms , raced toward the camp , waving long , deadly spears as they charged . Behind them rumbled huge hairy creatures , bent , misshapen , terrible , with big flat broadswords . The monsters moved slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out three or four Zylongi kids . Behind them came the cavalry , smartly uniformed soldiers on excellent horses carrying long , heavy lances , right out of one of the very old films about the West from the Earth film museum . What the hell are these troopers doing out here ? The woman did n't tell me a bit of truth . Exploding light and O'Neill 's rifle fire surprised the attackers . The lancers turned tail immediately  --  under orders , no doubt , to avoid organized conflict . The hordi raced into the fringes of the camp , where they were met by a devastating volley of carbine fire . I woke them up , O'Neill thought grimly . In the nick of time . He tossed another illumination grenade and continued to fire into the ranks of the attacking warriors . He was sym- pathetic to their cause , but such attacks would not bring peace to Zylong . Besides , somehow , the troops in the camp were his , almost as much as was his squadron of Wild Geese . Disoriented into panic by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled , leaving their taller and more frightening allies to withdraw in slightly better order , cartying off armloads of equipment from the camp . The carbines of the camp were silent . " Carbines ! " exclaimed O'Neill in despair . " The fools are letting them get away with the guns ! " He ran down the slope toward the camp . By now the light from the grenade was gone . The camp was in a shambles . Soldiers were milling about in panic . Retha , her cloak ripped to shreds , was crumpled up on the desert floor by the tent she shared with Marjetta , sobbing hysterically . Sergeant Markos was holding onto his bloody arm , swearing with greater skill than O'Neill would have expected from a Zylongi , even a Zylongi noncom . He shook the man . " Where 's Pojoon ? " " Dead , " grimaced the Sergeant , obviously in great pain . " Marjetta ? " " They 've got her . " " You must have shot the one who had me , " sobbed the hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant . " Destroyed . They got every gun but mine . " " What will they do to Marjetta ? " O'Neill hardly dared to ask it . " They 'll cook her . What else do you think hordi do with captives ? They 're cannibals . " Sergeant Markos was desperate with pain and anger . Retha 's wails reached a nightmare pitch . It had been a stupid mission from the beginning . Now O'Neill had to deal with a wounded Sergeant and a hysterical junior officer . He picked Retha off the ground and clobbered her . " Look , you little coward , you had better forget that you 're not qualified to command , or none of us will ever get back to the City alive . You 're the commanding officer of this unit  | now . If you do n't have the kind of defense perimeter you read about in the textbook when I come back , I 'll personally boil you slowly in oil ! " He then dumped her on the ground . Much to his surprise he heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started up the hill . Poor kid . How do you arrange a defense perimeter when all you have to fight with are carbines and some discarded spears ? O'Neill did not use his light as he stumbled up the steep barren hills . He trusted to his dubious psychic instinct to discover where in the vast night Marjetta was being held . Just when he needed it , of course , this sensitivity stopped functioning . After hours of desperate searching and uncounted curses aimed at the Lady Cardinal , he collapsed , cold , tired , and discouraged . He had climbed well into the foothills now and found no trace of hordi or their companions , those big ugly hairy monsters he had glimpsed in the glare of the illumination grenade . Marjetta is gone . I 'd better give up and go back . Why did she , a competent officer destined for responsibility , come on this expedition ? O'Neill shook his head . Did she know that her chances to survive this trip were nil ? Did she seek such an end ? Probably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening in the room , almost as though she did n't care whether I raped her or not . Perhaps the woman did n't want to live . He sighed . And she was still the proper woman . People die on pilgrimage . You mourn them . You remember them . And you go on . Someday you 'll meet them again and have a drink and laugh over it all  --  Seamus was not one of those who thought that the drink or laughter would be excluded from the kingdom of heaven . He said a prayer for her and asked her to forgive him for giving up . He was a soldier and he had his duty  --  Even if those idjits on Iona have forgotten about me . As he started down the depression reaching back toward the ridge that pointed to camp , O'Neill stopped for a moment  | and looked along the slight valley . For a fleeting moment he thought he saw a light flicker . A camp fire ? He eased himself back up on the ridge . Careful not to dislodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of it , where it linked to the next ridge , the valley below deepened into a steep ravine . At the bottom was the mouth of a cave obscured by a rock at one side . Gingerly O'Neill slipped down into the ravine . Edging around the rock and peering into the eerily lit cave , O'Neill saw two naked hordi women tending a fire . A male was using a crude stone knife to prepare a spit . Outlined against the wall were a number of childish heads . At first , no sign of Marjetta . I could wipe out the whole bunch of them , but that would n't bring her back . Besides , I do n't know if they 're the ones who attacked us . Then he saw her . At the back end of the cave , stripped , bound and gagged , and suspended from a rock outcropping , like a slaughtered steer . Is she still alive ? They have n't skinned her , have they ? Well , there 's only one way to find out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting , no doubt , a very succulent meal . He could smell the hot coals on their campfire . If he fired into the cave he could easily kill Marjetta with a ricocheting bullet . He reached for the knife that was a souvenir from the monorail incident and reversed the carbine to make it a club . I kind of outweigh them all , if I do n't exactly outnumber them . Taking a deep breath and mumbling a short prayer , he plunged into the cave , screaming like an angry and injured banshee . The hordi were terrified at the sight of a red-bearded giant . Two quick shoves with the rifle butt and the females were cowering against the wall , their bodies protecting the children . The male hordi was braver ; he turned toward O'Neill with the stone knife in his hand . O'Neill felt a moment of sympathy with the little creature ; he stood his ground in defense of his home , family , and provisions . One fast  | swing of the rifle knocked the stone from the hordi 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's captor was out of action for a couple of hours . He slashed the coarse rope that attached her to the rock , tossed her over his shoulder , grabbed a carbine and a heavy sack that lay on the floor , and left the cave . Marjetta was conscious . Her struggling body impeded his progress as he ran through the ravine and up to the ridge , stumbling and staggering as he went . Her muffled shrieks suggested that she might want to say something ; so , at a safe distance from the cave , O'Neill paused long enough to pull the gag from her mouth . " Put me down you fool . Untie me ! " she ordered . " Where have you been ? Why did it take so long for you to find me ? " " Well , that 's gratitude for you . " In exasperation he dumped her rudely to the ground . " We do n't have time to stop . They 'll follow us or raise the alarm and get the whole tribe down on us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the she-demons were screaming . They think you are some great red god . It will be days before they dare leave the cave . We can go much more quickly if you are not carrying me . " Then softly she added , " You need not feel obliged to tell me about the Captain . I saw him as they were dragging me out of the camp . " Should I offer sympathy or congratulations ? O'Neill wondered . She stumbled on , her voice wavering , " He was a good man , O'Neill . He . . . he deserved better than me . " Not knowing what to say , O'Neill coldly suggested they climb the next ridge . From higher ground they could get a view of the desert in the now gray night just before dawn . Silently Marjetta stumbled up the slope behind him on legs stiff from the lack of circulation . At the top they could see the lower hills leading to the desert . O'Neill pointed silently toward where he thought the camp was . Marjetta nodded .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? " Ile turned and saw a glow rising from the other side of the ridge , perhaps two hundred yards away . They picked their way cautiously through the boulders around a great rock to peer into the next valley . Marjetta clutched his arm . The valley before them was a wide circular hollow more than a mile in diameter , reaching deep into the earth . Almost every inch of the hollow was occupied by a tent city , illuminated by many glittering camp fires . Though most of the occupants were apparently asleep , O'Neill and Marjetta could see occasional armed bands of hordi and Zylongi patrolling the perimeters . This was a serious military position , commanded by tough-minded professionals . In the center was a compound of larger tents . Here a large armed guard was posted , their spears angled away from their bodies ready for action . O'Neill estimated that there must be at least seven thousand warriors , maybe ten thousand . Later , preoccupied about other problems , he would forget the existence of this army , not that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . Marjetta leaned against a large rock . " Narth 's camp , " she murmured , " not more than a day 's march from the cultivated regions . Only three days from the City itself . " Although it was hardly the place for a lesson in Zylongian history , nevertheless O'Neill announced bluntly that he would not take one more step until he knew exactly what was going on .  | " I am unclad , " Marjetta protested . " That is unfortunate , but it 's dark , and just now I 'm not interested in your body , as admirable as it may be and as delightful as arguably it could be under other circumstances . " That should put her down . " Right now all I want is the truth . And if I do n't get the truth , all the easier to put you over my knee and give you the spanking you 've been asking for since ... " " Since I saw you kissing the Research Director . " The woman actually had the audacity to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what I know . I warn you , however , there is much that I do n't know . Even the highest officers can not be aware that Narth is so near . " " Talk , " Seamus ordered . So she talked , concisely , lucidly , like the good soldier she was . Seamus was almost prepared to forgive her for her ingratitude . The Zylongi , it seemed , had various ways of dealing with those who threatened to disrupt their civilization . Some " went to the god " at the Festival  --  those who were defective , mentally ill , or too old . Others  --  those considered socially disruptive  --  disappeared into the acid vats . Some were too important or too well known to suffer either fate . They were publicly thrust out of the City in a solemn ceremony . They were what Sammy and Ernie had called " no longer with us . " Those who did n't die in the desert or the jungle survived in small communities that struggled to exist off tiny patches of cultivable ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neill saw during the attack on their camp were mutants , the result of mistakes in the computer-programmed genetic manipulations . They were exposed to die outside in the cultivated areas . The hordi , however , considered these deformed creatures to be sacred rind saved as many as they could , producing another race of humanoid type on the planet . They were smarter and stronger than the hordi but intensely loyal to their foster parents . The wild hordi , once considered numerically depleted to the point of extinction , seemed to be regenerating . They hated the City folk and killed them whenever possible , then ate their flesh in the hope of absorbing their strength . " A fate from which you bravely saved me . " " Uhm . Keep talking . " The hordi preferred the wetter , hotter , and lush regions on the other side of the mountains and existed in uneasy truce with the exiled Zylongi , who lived on the side of the mountain facing the desert . Both groups sometimes combined to make forays into the desert to raid ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . Five years ago , Marjetta told him , a brilliant Zylongi General was sent into exile for plotting revolution . " He was one of my teachers , a demented man , but one with a vision that many of us found attractive . He wanted to clean away the Committees and make himself Emperor . Then he would restore all the old freedoms . " " You want an Emperor ? " There was silence in the darkness opposite him . Then a tentative answer . " I do n't expect to live long enough for it to matter , but no , an emperor , especially one like Narth , would merely exchange one form of tyranny for another . I want freedom . " Do you now ? So after all these years , people down here know what it is . I hope you 're listening up there , Lady Deirdre , and admiring my taste in women at that . Aloud he said , " Keep talking . " Narth was not docile at his exile ceremony , but threat     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
