Dad and daughter at Playboy <P> Marrying the boss 's daughter has been one route to the top in American business . Last week Christie Hefner , 29 , got to the top by being the boss 's daughter . Hugh Hefner , 56 , founder and chairman of the board of Playboy Enterprises , Inc. , announced that he was promoting his daughter to president . Said the proud papa : " Christie 's promotion is a natural transition . She has certainly been well prepared for this move . " <P> Christie , who is single , has already become familiar to Playboy readers through promotional pictures in the magazine . She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brandeis University in 1974 ( major : English literature ) . After joining her father 's company a year later , she helped develop a new series of quarterly magazines on such subjects as fashion and electronics . She also became the company 's spokeswoman , and earned a reputation for candor and business savvy . <P> With two Hefners running Playboy , there was no more room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daniels , a former vice president of Knight-Ridder Newspapers , was brought into the company in 1976 to straighten out its ragged management structure , a job at which most critics say he succeeded . He leaves with severance pay of $470,000 . <P> Christie 's first task will be to complete a radical transformation of Playboy Enterprises . The firm was forced to sell its highly profitable British gambling casinos , and also had to drop out of an Atlantic City hotel-casino when New Jersey authorities denied it a gambling license . Moreover , money-losing ventures , including Oui magazine and two resort-hotels , have been sold , and the firm is negotiating the sale of its book operations . <P> The new president says she plans to focus the company 's attention once again on its 16 remaining clubs and Playboy magazine . For the future , her biggest hopes are on Playboy 's entry into cable and pay TV . Says she : " I think we can begin to make a significant mark with the Playboy Channel .
