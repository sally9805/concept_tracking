For the past several years , Iran has been busy making itself the world 's odd man out : ignoring United Nations efforts to end its war with Iraq , boycotting the U.N . Security Council because of its alleged anti-Tehran bias , attacking neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf . Last week it paid the price for its self-imposed isolation . Twice it sought an international condemnation of the U.S. on an issue on which Washington would otherwise have been vulnerable , the July 3 shootdown of Iran Air Flight 655 over the gulf . But twice it came away with nothing . <P> Iran 's first plea was to the International Civil Aviation Organization , meeting in Montreal . But of the 33 nations that sit on the I.C.A.O. 's governing body , only four ( the Soviet Union , China , Czechoslovakia and Cuba ) were in favor of condemnation . Iran eventually had to settle for a statement that merely " deplored " the incident and promised an investigation . <P> Simultaneously , Ali Akbar Velayati , Iran 's Foreign Minister , was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He read a transcript of conversations between the pilot of the doomed Airbus and Iranian flight controllers that seemed to indicate that Flight 655 had been proceeding at a normal altitude , speed and flight path . However , on one crucial point  --  whether the U.S.S. Vincennes had tried to warn the Airbus  --  the transcript was inconclusive . Flight 655 received no warnings , but the pilot may have been too busy chattering to his ground controllers to listen to an emergency channel over which the messages presumably would have been sent . <P> Velayati was in effect beaten before he began . Iran had delayed its presentation for two days while trying to round up the nine votes ( out of 15 ) needed for condemnation of the U.S. , but gave up and decided not to present a draft resolution . The Security Council session instead served largely to advance the presidential campaign of George Bush , who happily volunteered to present the American case . <P> Bush conceded that many details of the shootdown " remain unclear . " But he hammered away on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of responsibility " because it " allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with passengers to proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle " ( the Vincennes was fighting with Iranian speedboats ) ; 2 ) the underlying cause of the tragedy was Iran 's insistence on continuing the gulf war against Iraq . Again and again Bush pointed out that Iran has defied U.N . Resolution 598 , which calls for a negotiated end to the war , although Iraq has accepted . <P> The White House had given Bush some ammunition early in the week by announcing that the U.S. would pay " compensation "  --  everybody avoided the word reparations  --  to the families of the 290 people killed aboard Flight 655 . The U.S. was doing so voluntarily , said Ronald Reagan , because " we are a compassionate people . " The President brushed aside reporters ' comments about a poll showing 61% of the American public opposed to compensation . That , said Reagan , was because of the unpopularity of the Khomeini government , and the compensation would not be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Red Crescent , the arm of the Red Cross in Muslim countries .
