If s mansion has become a shrine , a mecca for legions of ardent fans . In 1982 , some 300,000 people filed through Graceland , the Mem  --  phis estate of Elvis Presley . By 1984 , about 520,000 devotees laid down $6.50 a pop for the tour , including a few moments at the King of Rock-'n% Roll 's grave . This year , as many as 575,000 may pay their respects . Although he died in 1977 , Presley is probably as popular now as when his career took off and soared in the 1950s and early ' 60s , and certainly more so than during the latter years of his life . " In fact , " says Irene Maleti , a 66-year-old great-grandmother and the member  --  ship chairman of a San Jose , California , Presley fan club , " nearly all the people who love Elvis refuse to speak of him in the past tense . " Despite the stories about Pres  --  ley 's eccentricities , his fans either overlook or flatly reject the allegations . Any Presley failings plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To millions of people around the world , Elvis Presley is , simply , a legend . Current times do not produce many legendary heroes . Al  --  though we have an abundance of " celebrities , " few seem to pos  --  sess the eminence that leads to en  --  during fame . Vying for space in People and US magazines by pos  --  ing for photos in bathtubs and telling all too much about their personal lives on numerous talk shows , our celebrities , however talented , have devalued the cur  --  rency of stardom . As Emerson suggested , " Every hero becomes a bore at last , " and the process today is swift . Curiously enough , we have n't really cherished heroes for a good 20 years . Though the assassination of President Kennedy , the Vietnam War and the Watergate affair are conven  --  ient and overused targets of blame for all sorts of national ailments and trends , these events did indeed reduce our want or need for heroes or , per  --  haps , the country 's ability to embrace them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly among youth and adults under 30 . In a recent survey taken by the Roper Organization for a national news magazine , respond  --  ents clearly accepted the concept ofheroes and noted a liking for the movie stars Clint Eastwood , Eddie Murphy , Jane Fonda and Sally Field ; the movie director Stephen Spielberg ; the Pope ; and President Reagan . In  --  terprets the George Washington Uni  --  versity sociologist Amitai Etzioni : " We 're back to yearning for leader  --  ship ! ' Yet a great difference lies between a widely admired personage and a legend . Within the last half-century or so America has had its share of heroes , including Charles Lindbergh , the generals Patton and MacArthur , and President Franklin D. Roose  --  velt . But precious few still capti  --  vate our collective imaginations . Among those that do , Elvis Pres  --  ley , James Dean , Babe Ruth , Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne stand out . What makes these five dispa  --  rate personalities legends ? What compels people to pay $6,500 for an 18-inch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses to Presley memora  --  bilia ? None of the five had any impact on politics , economics or the physical betterment of the na  --  tion . Ruth played baseball , and the others were entertainers . Why revere them , and not great physi  --  cians and scientists ? Well , the nature of myth  --  ology  --  along with those rare characters who embody legen  --  dary qualities  --  has n't really changed over thousands of years . Oral traditions created our early legendary figures , and the spoken tales were then put into writing , which served the same purpose in bringing legends to public atten  --  tion . Homer , for example , spread the legend of Odysseus . Now mo  --  tion pictures are the primary myth-making form . Homer , the blind Greek poet , is himself a legend ; in movies , strong acting personalities often become bet  --  ter known than the legendary charac  --  ters they play and eventually sym  --  bolize the values inherent in the por  --  trayal . In hard analysis , these associations are unfounded , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although fans are aware that Clint " Make My Day " Eastwood does n't really bend laws and bypass the bureaucracy to justly punish brutal criminals , it 's what he represents on the screen that counts . Thus , the fantasy projections ulti  --  mately develop a kind of substance in the minds of viewers . Values , then , are the key . Each of these five legends came to stand for something  --  common but unarticu  --  lated feelings or values  --  far greater than career success . Ruth embodied the rugged , individualistic , winning image America had of itself ; Presley and Dean provided a voice for the disaffected and restless youth of the postwar generation ; Monroe repre  --  sented the vanguard of the sexual revolution ; and " Duke " Wayne can  --  not be psychically separated from his conservative and patriotic political stance . Other elements of their lives cer  --  tainly contributed . An untimely death surely catalyzed the Dean legend ; the relatively early passings of Presley and Monroe lent them a tragic aura . All but Wayne grew up poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ents and started out against great odds . Each , despite glamour , also had a common touch . Yet all five projected an element of danger , a volatility that nonetheless was attrac  --  tive . As the historian Marshall Fishwick explains in his book , American Heroes : Myth and Reality : " Our legends . . believe . . . they can do any damn thing once they set their minds to it . " Our idols , he believes , " do n't like fences . " Presley , Dean , Ruth , Monroe and Wayne were strong , willful , fence-busting personalities . Moreover , at a time when celebri  --  ty is precarious , when notable figures wear thin , these five transcend celebrity . It may be a long while before anyone else can speak for and capture the hearts of so many , like the following legends that wo n't die .

Elvis Presley was a pio  --  neer rocker , and to many , The King remains unchallenged . Indeed , says Ken Brixey , the direc  --  tor of marketing for Graceland En  --  terprises , which manages Presley 's mansion , Elvis ' recordings have sold more than one billion copies , " more than the next four groups of people combined . We figured that for Mi July/August 198 chael Jackson to pass Elvis , " adds Brixey , " he 'd have to maintain the same kind of success he had in 1984 for the next 24 years . " After he served in the army , Pres  --  ley gave 1,140 concerts  --  all sellouts . He never again sang to an empty seat . Elvis made 33 movies , none notable in cinematic history , but many never  --  theless entertaining .

And while Elvis was a passable actor , I think that with bet  --  ter advice and career direction , he could have been a real good one . " When Presley died in 1977 at age 42 , his career had clearly gone into a mid-life slump . Though his album sales were chugging along , he had n't cut a real hit record since 1972 . He 'd gained weight and ap  --  peared puffy and bloated ; he had become an object of satire and ridicule among the self-styled sophisticated and hip . Macabre as it may sound , his death revived his career . The rush by fans to get a piece of Elvis was on . Speculators hoarded editions of Memphis newspapers contain  --  ing accounts of his demise , and fans paid as much as $100 a copy . More than 200 Elvis imitators took to the road , some undergo // lastic surgery to achieve closer resemblance .

" About 220 active Elvis Presley fan clubs circulate let  --  ters filled with Elvis " news , " trade or sell memorabilia and meet to talk him , " she says . " Well , it does look like a museum , but it 's not a shrine . I do n't go in there to worship , and I 'm not obsessed . I go in there to listen to records , look at scrapbooks and just relax and enjoy myself . " Maleti seems to treat her Elvis hobby much as others would golf , woodworking or any other time-consuming pursuit . " I even listen to other singers , " she explains . " Of course , some of my friends in the club get after me if I 'm listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of Elvis fans came out of the closet when he died . " Graceland , on the other hand , is in  --  deed a shrine . Along with the $6.50 tour , which lasts an hour and a half , one can also visit a gift shop , buy food or pay an extra $3.50 for a tour of Presley 's jet , the Lisa Marie , named after his only child . Mail ad  --  dressed to him still pours into the mansion . " I 'm often asked why the Elvis legend is so strong , " says Brixey , " and often struggle with the ques  --  tion . I guess the best answer is that he was a blue-collar worker who in spirit never tried to rise above his roots . He 's the epitome of a man who start  --  ed out with nothing , became some  --  thing and never lost his attraction to the masses . He 's a true folk hero . " The Rebel James Dean was anything but common . As the actor Martin Sheen  --  a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " James Dean was the strongest influence of any actor that ever stepped before a camera . Ever ! And the strength has never really diminished . Young people who were n't even alive at the time are still influenced by his work . " It was Elvis who changed the music , suggests Sheen , " and James Dean who changed our lives . " Strong stuff for a guy who starred in only three movies , East of Eden , Rebel without a Cause and Giant . But the characters Dean portrayed in the first two films did touch nerves , particu  --  larly among youth . In Rebel , his Jim Stark was the frustrated son of deluded parents who kept moving in futile attempts to solve the family 's problems . He told a generation of kids who felt isolated by difficulties with parents and peers that there were many others like them . In fact , many teens dragged their parents to see Rebel without a Cause because Dean conveyed their feelings far better than they ever could themselves . He was a nonconformist  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - roller . ( In fact , Elvis took Dean as his acting model and could recite virtually every line from Rebel . ) James Dean projected to teens the sense that life is full of insoluble problems and that therefore aliena  --  tion and rebellion are natural re  --  sponses . In real life , Dean was a headstrong and mercurial character , totally ded  --  icated to the Method , a free-form act  --  ing process in which a performer delves deeply into the nuances of a character . Though his coworkers re  --  spected and were awed by Dean 's formidable talent , and felt affection when he turned on his charm , they also found him frustrating to work with . His energy sapped theirs , and he was the consummate scene stealer . Born in a small Indiana town , Dean was taken by his parents to Southern California when he was a toddler . His mother died when he was nine , and his father sent James back to Fairmount , Indiana , where he was raised by relatives .

Although he appeared in a couple of Broadway plays and on live television in the early 1950s , James Dean is remembered for his three films , the last two released after he died . Dean 's performance in East of Eden had made him the hottest property in Hollywood ; the public was beginning to fix its attention on him . Insiders Visitors pay $6.50 each for a 1v-hour tour of Graceland . For another $3.50 they can also tour Presley 's luxurious private jet . who 'd seen Rebel and Giant thought his future was unlimited . His death in 1955 at age 24 secured his legend .

One of two sur viving children of eight born to a Baltimore saloon keeper , Ruth was in and out of trouble . At age eight , this incorrigible youth was placed in a home for disadvantaged boys . And though the brothers who ran the home could n't turn him from a taste for corporeal delights , they did instill in the boy a love for base ball . As he grew into a hulking teen , Ruth clearly demonstrated a talent for the game . By age 20 he was a star pitcher for the Boston Red Sox , a brash ballplayer who nonetheless backed up his boasts with winning perfor  --  mances . Ruth would probably have been a Hall of Famer on his pitching performances alone ; he could also hit , so in 1918 the Sox shifted him to the outfield . The next year he smacked a record 29 home runs and proceeded to change the very nature of the game . Before Ruth , professional baseball had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that scratched for a few runs . Sold to the Yankees , Ruth by his prodigious hitting enabled his new team to sit back and wait for the big in  --  ning . The big stick made base  --  ball a game of power and grandeur . Ruth , the private person , had well-publicized indul  --  gences . He earned big money and often spent it at the race  --  tracks . He had gargantuan ap  --  petites for everything . The un  --  disciplined Ruth defied managers , owners and baseball leaders . And the public loved him . His style of play had something to do with his popularity  --  but the 1920s were also a time when values began to change , when thrift and prudence meant less than they once had . And if Ruth was unrefined , he was equally full of charm . He was the only person in the country who could get away with greet ing Warren G. Harding by say ing , " Hot as hell , ai n't it , Pres ? " He was as insouciant as all Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children in particular gravi tated toward " The Babe , " and he returned their affec  --  tions . Active in youth charities and benefits , Ruth paid many a hospital bedside visit to young fans as well . A lovable " bear " of a man , Ruth was adored as a hero by kids everywhere . The times , the so-called Golden Age of Sports , en  --  hanced the Ruth legend . He Aaron 's 755 , is the number remembered by most . His 60 home runs in 1927 is esteemed more than the 61 hit by Roger Maris in 1961 ? Maris needed a few more games to do it . Ruth had a lifetime batting average of .342 . Images , of course , enhance the legend more than statistics . Ruth 's reputed gesture toward the center-field bleachers in the 1932 World Series  --  and the home run that followed  --  created a greater stir than many better-documented he  --  roics .

MM  --  Goddess If Marilyn Monroe were to try to make it in Hollywood today , she probably would n't get past the studio gates or draw more than a cursory look from an agent . Her appear  --  ance is not that of the Woman of the ' 80s , for by current standards she is a bit too plump and rounded . Moreover , in these times " The Blonde Bombshell " has be  --  come the stuff of caricature . Marilyn Monroe did arrive at the right time for her look ; now , 23 years after her death from a drug overdose , she is as much as ever the essence of sensuality . Norman Mailer has called her " the sweet angel of sex , " but Monroe also carried with her an air of vulnerability . Furthermore , her acting contained a fine comic touch that created a devastating package , a star quality that no living actress , however slim and talented , can match . As Ernie Garcia , head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says , " She was like a combination of Daisy Mae and Cinderella . " The Monroe image still carries world-wide appeal . French girls born after she died dress and fix their hair in Monroe styles . Bou  --  tiques and stores do a steady business selling such mementos as life-size cardboard stand-ups of Monroe and Marilyn posters , calendars , salt shakers , lamps , ceramic masks and figurines . The traffic in Monroebilia is tremendous as fans seek physical ties to her life . One man paid $1,040 for a beaded evening bag that once belonged to her , and a strapless evening gown she wore in the movie Bus Stop sold for nearly $2,000 several years ago . Fans still pay homage at her crypt in Westwood , tionships with the Kennedys abound . Her morals were her own .

That squint , the rolling , half-sideways walk and the ca  --  dences of his speech are unforget  --  table . Say to yourself these lines from his Oscar-winning role in True Grit : " I mean to kill you or see you hanged .

It may still be one of the best West  --  erns ever made . Wayne is associated with West  --  ern roles , although nearly half his films had little or nothing to do with horses and six-shooters . ( Between 1948 and 1959 , only 7 of the 27 Wayne films released were of this genre . ) Though film critics have a tendency to look down on Westerns , those roles brought legendary status to Duke Wayne , He admitted that Westerns were simple , but he considered good ones art . " They deal in life and sudden death and primitive struggle , " he once explained , " and with basic emotions  --  love , hate , anger . In other words , they 're made of the same raw ma  --  terials Homer used . Westerns are folklore , just the same as the Il  --  iad is . " If critics did n't under  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne as Odys  --  seus on horseback . Wayne 's films showed a clear-cut world where good whipped evil . Though Duke was an in  --  dividualist in most of the films , he was n't necessarily a " loner " : Often you 'd catch the nuance that he was a private person suf  --  fering some personal loss or wound . But most of the time he appeared as a rancher , a lawman or a soldier who acted in har  --  mony with others to bring order where lawlessness had prevailed . Admired as well for his recov ery from cancer in 1964 , Wayne began to lose some of his popularity because of his political beliefs . He supported the Vietnam war at a time most Ameri  --  cans had turned against the country 's involvement .

Wayne died in 1979 , just a few years before his brand of con  --  servatism came into vogue . Be  --  cause of this latter development , the time may be right for a John Wayne revival . The film critic An  --  drew Sarris , writing in the New Republic shortly after Wayne 's passing , expressed an admiration for Duke 's talent , a viewpoint Sarris conceded would irritate his liberal colleagues . His point was that Wayne was a fine actor . He lacked the range of classic British actors and the depth of the Method performers , explained the critic , but he had subtle vir  --  tues . Sir Ralph Richardson re  --  marked that Wayne " projectedlooks for a fight but does n't back down once one starts . Like Ruth , he represented something America per  --  ceived in itself .

The character portrayed by James Stewart had just revealed to a young reporter that he was n't really the one who shot Valance , although that tale had brought him great fame over the years . Stewart asked the reporter if he planned to use the startling disclosure . The reporter said no , explaining , " When the legend be  --  comes a fact , print the legend . " So it is with all American leg  --  ends , who had failings just like any other human 's . Once our perceptions are established , facts that could diminish the legend do n't get in the way . The images , once forged , refuse to fade . Twenty-three years have passed since she died , but our affair with Marilyn Monroe is still sizzling . Marilyn dolls , clothing and perfume all confirm a continuing devotion to her legend .                   @ @
