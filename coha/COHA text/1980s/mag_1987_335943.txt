Ronald Reagan positively beamed before the audience of 1,400 scientists and businessmen at the Washington Hilton Hotel last week . Declaring that the " sky is the limit , " the President pledged unprecedented federal support for private U.S. efforts to develop a suddenly glamorous new breed of materials : superconducting ceramics . The substances can convey electric currents with no loss of energy at temperatures much higher than conventional superconductors . They open the way for such marvels as levitating high-speed trains and tiny but immensely powerful computers . " The breakthroughs in superconductivity bring us to the threshold of a new age , " Reagan said . " It 's our task to herald in that new age with a rush . " <P> The two-day session was an all-American jamboree that pointedly excluded foreign participants . Explained William Graham , the President 's science adviser : " It is not so much a fear as a certain realization . The Japanese will move very aggressively in this area . " Reagan outlined an eleven-point plan that ranged from the promise of $150 million in Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antitrust laws so that firms may collaborate on projects . Recalling remarks by Frank Press , president of the National Academy of Sciences , Energy Secretary John Herrington declared , " Superconductivity has become the test case of whether the U.S. has a technological future . " <P> American scientists have eagerly pursued that future since last winter , when a burst of research activity rescued superconductors from relative obscurity . The excitement followed a discovery in the spring of 1986 by IBM scientists in Zurich . Their find : a metallic ceramic compound that became a superconductor at a temperature well above the previously achieved record of 23.2 Kelvin , or - 418 degrees F. By year 's end researchers were developing materials that became superconductors at higher and higher temperatures . At the University of Houston , a team led by Paul C.W. Chu set the currently recognized standard last February , when it produced superconductivity at a balmy 98 K ( - 283 degrees F ) . <P> All at once a dazzling array of superconductor uses seemed tantalizingly possible . Researchers now estimate that high-speed computers using superconductors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 300-m.p.h. trains that float on magnetic cushions , which now exist as prototypes but may take at least a decade to perfect . Power lines that can meet a city 's electric needs with superconductor cables may be even farther in the future. , <P> But getting superconductors from the laboratory to the marketplace will be no easy task . " What worries me is that people may come to think that they 're going to buy superconducting circular saws at Sears next year , " says Don Capone , a physicist at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago . Concurs Nobel Laureate Robert Schrieffer , who shared the 1972 prize for developing a theory of how superconductors work : " It 's time for everyone to catch their breath and try to understand what Mother Nature has presented us.
