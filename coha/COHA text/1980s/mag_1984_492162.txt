The argument has gone art for years : Did Christopher Columbus discover America in 1492 , or was it Leif Eriksson some 400 years earlier ? The translation of petroglyphs ( carvings or line-drawings on a rock ) found in West Virginia indicates that Columbus and Eriksson may have both been Johnny-come-latelies . According to these astounding revelations , the first Europeans to visit America came Could these carvings be a hoax ? Although possible , it seems unlikely . The prankster would not only have had to possess a knowledge of ogham , but who would have undertaken the extremely difficult task of carving the stones just for a joke ? If the carvings are not a hoax , we are left to speculate about who made the markings  --  and why . An extensive knowledge of the legends of pre-Columbian discoveries of America is not needed to come up with some plausible answers  --  beginning with the narrative of an Irish abbot named St. Brendan . Late in the sixth century A.D. , Irish monks having trouble finding the isolation required for their lifestyles began looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the men reputed to have traveled the Atlantic looking for such a protective spot was St. Brendan . The story of his exploits has no doubt been enhanced over the years . Still , it 's a story grounded in fact . St. Brendan was not a fictitious character , he was an abbot and he did go on sailing expeditions . It is also quite possible he journeyed as far from Ireland as the coast of North America . In any case , other monks , following his lead , sailed to the Faeroe and Shetland islands and on to Iceland . Then , in A.D. 870 , the Norsemen who landed in Iceland brought with them  --  women ! Too much temptation  --  the weaker-willed monks moved on . But where ? Some may have gone back to Ireland or the other islands . Others may have headed west , as did St. Brendan , in search of the Promised Land of the saints .

He rested often , but in less than three-quarters of an hour he had climbed it . He stood on the edge of a cliff that dropped sheer to a dry creek bed 150 feet below . Jerry turned away . He did not think about the Indian girl who was supposed to have jumped down there . He did n't believe any part of the story . He had known many Indians and he just could n't imagine it . He lay with his hands behind his head for an hour after he returned to Maria 's , staring at the ceiling . She was all around him , in the things she owned and wore . There was a small crucifix on the wall and there were two highly colored lithographs of the Holy Family and of the Virgin of Guadalupe . There was a pink garment not long enough to reach her knees . It was lying across the bed that she did not have time to make before she left , so he knew that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the something in which she slept . Her powder was spilled on the dresser top , and it had a strong scent . There was a green ribbon on the floor . Jerry knew all of those things , and where they were , without looking at them . There was something else ; a fountain-pen gift box on the dresser top near the spilled powder . He rose suddenly and picked it up . The pen inside was cheap , like the box , a ball-point that , obviously , had never been used . He went on a quiet search for paper . Everything that she owned was in the two rooms . She did not own much . There was no paper . The calendar on the kitchen wall advertised a filling station . None of the months had been torn off . He tore off the month of January and wrote slowly , laboriously , on the back of it . " Dear Maria , " he wrote , " thanks . I wo n't forget . Someday I 'll do something for you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There were two crumpled dollar bills that he had not owned in the right-hand pocket of his trousers . He did not discover them until he reached the highway . He stood for a moment , weighing pride against his necessity ; then he walked back and placed one of the bills on the table under his note . He kept the other one because he was unsure of himself now in strange territory without the guitar . A truck that was hauling pipe picked him up and he did n't ask where it was going . It was going somewhere , Jerry Lawlor lived . He washed dishes and he swept floors and he did odd jobs where he found the jobs , sleeping wherever he was permitted to sleep , eating whatever was given him to eat . When the winter closed down on the western slope , he was working for a man named Lindstrom in a town of 600 people . Carl Lindstrom operated a hotel of 15 rooms , which was never filled to capacity even in September ' 84 the summertime . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a handyman his necessities for whatever the man could do . At first , there was not much that Jerry could offer him . As the weeks went by , however , Jerry 's body came slowly back to life . He shoveled snow then , and he cut kindling , and he did odd jobs of carpentry . When he had developed new muscles , Jerry fought grimly with a big man named Pedro down snow-covered walks , and lashed into him with the ax that split the piled lengths of wood . At night sometimes he thought of Maria , but not often ; when night came , he was too tired for thought . The big man was a job that he had to do , a score that he had to even , a fight that he had to fight . He could think of him through the day , and the thinking gave his muscles a goal , a reason for being , an objective needing strength . He ate well and he slept well ; he worked hard and he grew . The winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a highway crew that repaired the ravages of winter . He was the lowly member who kept track of tools and hauled water , ran errands and did innocuous things such as restoring fallen highway markers to their proper places . By June he was driving a truck for a highway contractor , and in July he went into the woods , with all other available manpower , to fight a forest fire . The fire lasted for ten days and he stood up to the work , the smoke , the loss of sleep , the irregular meals , the fatigue of forced marches , the danger . He knew , when the fire was out , that he was whole again . In early August , after the fire , he went to Denver with one of the trucks . He had money in his pockets and sound working clothes . He went down on Larimer Street where the pawnshops are and he priced guitars . He found one with a deep , mellow tone , a black one that felt right under his continued on following page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had when he went to Patata . He held it , savoring the moment , proud in the knowledge that he could afford it . Then he saw the wrist watch . It gleamed brightly from a box lined in velvet , small , bright , feminine . He thought of Maria , saw her , saw the watch on her slender arm . She did not have a watch . There was n't a clock in her two rooms . She never knew what time it was , save by a certain instinct that told her to go to work , to eat , to go to sleep . Jerry pointed to the case . " How much is that ? " he said . It cost more than the guitar . Jerry looked at it . He could buy it . He laid the guitar on the counter , turning his back on it . He lifted the tiny box containing the watch . There was hardly any weight to it . " Wrap it up , " he said . He went back to the highways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin and the labor swelled his muscles . He had a sure feeling about Pedro now , and he did not have to think about him . He could take him when the time came , and he would . He thought more often of Maria . He had a present for her and he was patient . It was the fall once more when Jerry Lawlor came back to Patata . The aspens were gold in the passes and the chili peppers were scarlet strings on the small houses and the huts . His job had come to an end with September , and he rode the back trail as he had ridden out , hitching a ride with a trucker . He stood on the main drag and he looked at Garcia 's sign in the distance . It was late afternoon , too early for her to be going on the night trick yet . It was n't reasonable that the wife of the boss would still be sick . Maria would not be working in the afternoon . He strode out swiftly , slowed with the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeded up again , impatient to know . The house and the yard were as he remembered them . No one had moved the crate on which he used to sit . Everything , like the Spanish joke she told him , was tomorrow ; nothing ever got done today . He knocked on the door . She was no longer young . The year had taken some of the rose tint from the ivory of her skin . Her eyes were not so bright and her mouth not so full . She was thinner and no electricity flowed from her . She opened the door and stood there , her clothes hanging limply on her . She did not know him . " Do n't you remember me , Maria ? " he said . " No . " She stared at him impassively ; then she leaned suddenly forward , her eyes widening in recogniGeromo , " she said . He entered the room behind her , the room that he remembered so well . She turned on the small lamp on the dresser . The crucifix and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . So was her narrow iron bedstead . The room had a double bed now . The precious Certificado de Matrimonio , in a dime-store frame , hung below the lithograph of the Holy Family . Maria was tearing the wrapping from the box . The wrist watch was gleaming glory against the dark velvet , a thing of flashing reflection , of daintiness , of femininity . Maria looked at it , hypnotized . Her eyes lifted slowly to Jerry 's . " I have never seen one so beautiful , " she said . She thrust her left arm out . " Show me how it works , Geromo . " He wound the watch , and his fingers trembled when he fastened the strap clasp on her wrist . She held the watch away from her , looking at it , turning it one way and then another . She held it against her ear and listened to it tick . The clasp fascinated her and she played with it , opening it and snapping it shut . " Geromo , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . The thought came back to him that he had known a year ago  --  that to enjoy the enjoyment of Maria was better than anything that he could have for himself . She took the watch off and put it on again , frowning slightly as she struggled with the clasp , smiling when she mastered it . She sighed at length , removed the watch from her wrist and replaced it carefully in the box . She held it , looking at it , then extended the box to Jerry . " Geromo , " she said , " you have made me very happy . All my life I will remember . " He stared at her , not comprehending . When he did not take the box , she tried to force it into his hand . " Someday , " she said , " you will have voice . A fact was a fact and it could not be altered . When she looked at him there was mystery in her eyes , and the excitement was gone . She was no longer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a woman and that he was still just a boy . Jerry accepted the box reluctantly , respecting something that he could not understand . He put it in his pocket , hestitated for a moment , and then looked up . " Is there anything that I can do for you ? " he said . She smiled at him . " But no , Geromo . You have already done much more for me than you know . I will always love you a little . " She kissed him , holding his face between her warm palms for a moment ; then she walked with him to the door . He stood on the highway , waiting for a truck , and the lights were on in the town . He thought briefly of Pedro , no longer hating him , no longer caring . Yesterday was over and everything was tomorrow . This Pedro , whatever he was , had found the love of a woman . It was something that Jerry had yet to know something he might know one day . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria and understood for the first time the gentle sadness of " Adios , Mariquita Linda " that he had learned from vaqueros . His hand closed around the small package in his pocket . The yellow lights of a truck gleamed on the highway then , and he raised his hand to them . A ' western as a stage actor , Charlton Heston began headlining theater marquees with Antony and Cleopatra in 1947 . " In those days actors disdained movies as nonserious , " he said . " That was before film had been recognized not only as the art form of the 20th century but the American art form , and no student of acting talked about going into the movies . " After Heston 's starring roles in Leaf and Bough and Design for a Stained Glass Window , the camera 's critical eye began to focus on this shy loner from the backwoods of St. Helen . For television , classic followed classic : MacBeth , The Taming of the Shrew , Of Human Bondage , Jane Eyre , Wuthering Heights . For the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Cid , The Greatest Story Ever Told , The Agony and the Ecstasy , Julius Caesar , The Three Musketeers , Airport 1975 , Earthquake , Midway . He became the biggest box-office attraction in the history of motion pictures . So Charlton Heston has an impressive background going for him ; today he is the social lion of Hollywood , right ? Wrong . Rather , he is said to have few personal friends in the movie community . He has been quoted as saying , " I have maybe five men to whom I feel close enough that could go to their houses at 3 o'clock in the morning and say , ' I just killed someone  --  quick , give me the keys to your car ! ' " He is seldom seen along the party circuit and spends little time drinking in nightclubs . Why ? Because he has to keep in shape . An agent put it another way : " If you had a party going , with lots of loose broads , plenty of booze , people with other people 's wives  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room and saw Moses leaning on the mantel staring at you ? " The Moses character aside , Heston 's personal lifestyle misses the movie magazines ' mold of a Hollywood celebrity by a wide margin . He married an art student , Lydia Marie Clark , in 1944 , while they were both at Northwestern . They are still married in 1984 . After having been shot at by gangsters and pursued by man-eating ants , having braved Comanche arrows , escaped incineration on the largest circus tanbark ever built and floundered in raging seas , Heston 's idea of a stimulating evening is to sit in his wood-lined study reading Arnold Toynbee . Even the two Heston offspring fall short of the bizarre standards established by celebrity children . Heston 's pride showed as he took care to spell their names while he told us that F-R-A-S-E-R is a screen writer and producer and H-O-L-L-Y is still in school , studying art history and hopcontinued on . following page                   @ @
