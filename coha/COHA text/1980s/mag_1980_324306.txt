Everyone will now be mobilized , and all boys old enough to carry a spear will be sent to Addis Ababa . Married men will take their wives to carry food and cook . Those without wives will take any woman without a husband . Anyone found at home after the receipt of this order will be hanged . <P> - Emperor Haile Selassie , as Italians invaded Ethiopia , 1935 <P> Life was simpler for the Lion of Judah . He did not have to sit in a little storefront near the Greyhound station and tempt young men and women into the military with fantasies of exotic travel and careers in computer maintenance . The Emperor had at least one advantage over the modern American recruiter , of course : a foreign invasion wonderfully concentrates the national mind . Absolute power over Columbia people also gave Selassie a certain edge . <P> The threat of hanging or the spectacle of Soviet parachutes blossoming over Chicago might make a similar difference to Americans .

There seems something dishonorable and even vaguely decadent in privileged Americans hiring others to do their duty for them . " As for " living , " the French symbolist Villiers de l'Isle-Adam once said with languid wit , " our servants will do that for us .
