 | Q. What 's black and white and " rude " all over ? A. The most exciting new band to cross the Atlantic this year . They call themselves the Specials ? five gangly white and two tough-looking black musicians from Coventry , England ? and they play an exhilarating , hybrid black-and-white music called " ska , " a crude form of reggae that flourished in Britain during the 1960s . Fueled by the New Wave fad for short and snappy dance tunes , the Specials have fused ska 's twitchy calypso rhythms , Mardi Gras brass bleat and roller-rink organ with their own homegrown anger . Onstage and on their debut album , " The Specials " ( Chrysalis ) , their cheerful bedlam sound explodes with the impact of a grenade in a tin drum . Dressed in porkpie hats and ill-fitting suits modeled on Jamaica 's ruffian " rude boy " gangs of the 1960s , the Specials last month burst onto the stage of New York 's Hotel Diplomat with a punk power that turned the staid ballroom into the scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparked by the slashing guitar licks of Roddy Radiation ( ne Byers ) and the throbbing bass lines of Horace ( Sir Horace Gentleman ) Panter , both of whom joyously pogoed up and down as they played . Gaptoothed bandleader Jerry ( General Dankey ) Dammers provided stabbing organ notes , and the two vocalists , Terry Hall and Neville Staples , twitched like rabbits as they thundered through their incredibly varied ska repertoire at breakneck speed . " Do n't bother to analyze it just dance , " exhorted Hall . And the crowd did ? bobbing and weaving when the Specials shifted to a flawless reggae rhythm , or wriggling madly to a fiery rock gutbuster . For all its energy , the Specials ' pulsing sound obscures a surprisingly sober message . " A Message to You Rudy , " with its Salvation Army horns , is really a call to Britain 's warring teen gangs to " Stop your messin ' around. /Better think of your future , /Time you straighten right out . " " Does n't Make It Alright " is a diatribe against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the band stages a harrowing re-enactment of gang warfare . " We 're saying it 's a waste of time to fight each other , " explains Dammers , the son of an Anglican minister . " It 's better to fight the system . " " We 've taken a lot of the questioning ideas from punk , " says Panter , a former art student . " But we 've added some optimism to it . " Alliance : Perhaps the Specials ' most important message is harmony between the races : they are one of the few bands that feature both black and white performers and attract mixed black-and-white crowds . The band hopes that its appeal to workingclass kids of both races , who have adopted rude-boy fashions in clothes , marks the " ( Dawning of a ) New Era , " the title of a Dammers song . But it may be an unstable alliance . Britain 's neo-Fascist National Front regularly recruits white " skinheads " from ska audiences , members of the racist British Movement interrupt concerts to yell " Sieg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Specials ? Plus Two ( the two West Indian members ) . But to many , the mere sight of the biracial band symbolizes the growth of a rock against racism . Says Panter : " I think our presence onstage is its own message . " @#
