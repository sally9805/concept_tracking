John Corigliano ' s wonderful " Promenade Overture " starts before you think it has . A few percussionists alone on stage suddenly drum out a rhythmic motive , and the conductor walks on and bows , which is part of the piece , which has already begun . Offstage the brasses sound a flourish , and the piccolo , tying a bow on top , walks to his chair . Then , one by one , the sections of the orchestra parade in , each playing its own little motto - the tootling flutes , the bassoons and oboes winning a hand with their irresistible little tune , the cellos swinging their instruments side to side , the violins , the violas , the horns , the swaggering trombones . Each motive dances on top of the others in a wonderful exhilaration of sound until everyone is on stage and the motives coalesce into an alluring waltz that is the center of the overture . This in turn is replaced by those genetic fanfares that whirl the waltz into a triumphal march . Only one thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dancing elephant writhing his lithe proboscis just in time for the end . Corigliano has composed this work in a more popular idiom than some of his other music , but with the same craftsmanship and without condescension . The idea was to share his own surprise and delight at his first hearing of Haydn ' s " Farewell Symphony , " and it reverses the procedure of that piece ; it even begins with a specific reversal of Haydn ' s music , for the initial trumpet fanfare is the last five measures of the Haydn symphony played backwards . The music is full of contemporary techniques the Pops audience would never ordinarily listen to ( except maybe in a movie about an invasion of giant gypsy moth caterpillars ) , but the techniques have been used resourcefully to contribute to the fun - just the way Rossini , say , used the techniques of his own day , and his own more serious works , in his bubblng overtures . The " Promenade " was composed in response to one of the Boston Symphony Orchestra ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pops last night . The performance by the Pops Esplanade Orchestra under the capable direction of John Williams had a lot of spirit ( you could tell that some of the musicians know all about the strutting bands of the Midwest ) , although the actual playing had been less rough and more accurate in rehearsal . What the piece needs now is more performances and a more secure sense of fun . Instead , it has not been scheduled for the rest of the season . This is part and parcel of the whole back-of-the-bus attitude toward contemporary music at the BSO . None of Corigliano ' s more extended works has been played here , although they have been around to the other major orchestras of the land , and , shockingly , none of the BSO ' s senior management figures deigned to come back from Tanglewood for this important premiere . The audience had a good time anyway , and that ' s why Corigliano wrote the piece . Afterwards , a poetic and promising 16-year-old pianist named Gustavo Romero made a dashing , if not everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
