For Anna Price of Washington , catastrophic health care means looking after her husband James , 78 , a retired federal worker who has suffered for ten years from Alzheimer 's disease . He can neither bathe nor dress himself . She frets about him constantly , and about how she will pay the doctor and the sitter who comes twice a week so she can go out to buy groceries . Even the $25 a month she pays for diaper-like underpants for her incontinent husband is a drain on ( their dwindling life savings , now less than $10,000 . <P> Last week the Senate took a sizable step to ease the burden on the Prices and millions of other Americans by passing the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act , the most dramatic expansion of federal health insurance since its enactment in 1965 . That same day the House derailed a bill that would have provided home health care for the chronically ill . It was a reminder that the Federal Government , too , has difficulty paying rising medical costs . <P> The Medicare extension breezed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the House ( 328 to 72 ) the week before , largely because of its self- financing mechanism . The program is to be paid for by Medicare 's 32 million beneficiaries , who will be charged an additional $4 monthly premium plus an income-based surtax . Among the provisions to be phased in during the next three years is the cost of respite care for up to 80 hours a year , which will allow many like Anna Price to hire occasional help . But the bill has little effect on the big-ticket item for 1.5 million elderly Americans : nursing-home costs , which average $22,000 a year . <P> Nor does it cover long-term home care  --  a gap that Claude Pepper , the 87- year-old champion of the elderly , tried to fill with his complementary bill . At $4.5 billion by 1990 , the Pepper proposal appealed more to the heart than to reason . " This is a day for which I 've waited and worked and I might say prayed for 50 years , " Pepper declared in an impassioned plea to his colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human values . " <P> Congress was more inclined to think about the cost , which Pepper proposed to cover by lifting the $45,000 cap on income subject to the 1.45% Medicare payroll tax . Projections showed that this tax hike would cost $9 billion by 1993 , a prospect that brought out thousands of small businesses and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in opposition . They were joined by the health-insurance industry , looking to protect its lucrative stake in private medigap insurance . <P> The day before the vote , 2,000 delegates at the National Council of Senior Citizens convention in Las Vegas took turns manning phones to remind Congressmen that the council 's 4.5 million members were watching . The 28 million-member American Association of Retired Persons also supported the bill . Far more effective , however , was a letter-writing campaign by one of the House 's mightiest chairmen , burly Dan Rostenkowski of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee . He and Chairman John Dingell of the Energy and Commerce Committee were incensed that Pepper had struck a deal to bypass their committees and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrage of " Dear Colleague " letters attacking the measure , and it was killed on a procedural vote , 243 to 169.
