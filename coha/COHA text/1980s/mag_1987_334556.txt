Denver Housewife Jeannie Lancaster suspected that something was wrong with her son a few months after his birth . " He was always fussy and would never cuddle , " she remembers . " When I would go to pick him up , he would arch away . " By the time he was one , he had acquired the alarming habit of banging his head against the wall , and when he began to talk , he repeated the same sound or word over and over again . Says Lancaster , " I kept asking myself , ' What am I doing wrong ? ' " Professional counselors offered conflicting views . A pediatrician thought the boy might be autistic . School officials said he was emotionally disturbed . Further testing indicated he was mildly retarded . <P> It was only after Lancaster had given birth to a second son who showed some of the same mysterious symptoms that a family doctor began to suspect the cause . He had just returned from a medical seminar on a newly recognized disorder called Fragile X syndrome , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex chromosome ( one of the 46 chromosomes  --  complex molecules containing long segments of DNA  --  in the nucleus of the human cell ) . The behavior of the Lancaster children seemed to fit the patterns described at the meeting , and tests at Denver 's Children 's Hospital soon confirmed that they both had the defective chromosome . <P> Virtually unknown to doctors five years ago , Fragile X has come to be recognized as a leading cause of mental retardation among newborns in the U.S. , second only to Down 's syndrome . It produces disabilities ranging from learning difficulties , especially in math , to mental retardation , often accompanied by such benign physical abnormalities as oversize ears , an elongated forehead , enlarged testes and double-jointedness . Recent research also suggests that Fragile X may be responsible for one out of ten cases of autism , a mysterious condition characterized by extreme withdrawal and refusal to communicate . At one time , autism was often blamed on cold , unfeeling parents . <P> Doctors diagnose Fragile X by using a microscope to examine X chromosomes isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly visible at the end of one of the chromosome 's arms . Last year a more accurate diagnostic test was devised by Geneticist W. Ted Brown , of the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities ( IBR ) on Staten Island . Brown 's team uses a technique in which snippets of DNA taken from the X chromosomes of people suspected of having the condition are compared with snippets from their normal relatives . <P> Because the defective site is on the X chromosome , females ( who are born with two Xs , one inherited from each parent ) are less often affected by the syndrome ; their normal X chromosome can mask the effects of the faulty one . But males , who have one X and one Y sex chromosome , have no such backup and are therefore more susceptible . Still , for reasons that baffle scientists , not all females are protected , and some males are spared . " About 20% of males who inherit the gene are unaffected carriers , and about a third of all females who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Children 's Hospital . " It 's a crazy inheritance pattern .
