For computer buffs visiting Pakistan 's historic city of Lahore , it seemed too good a bargain to pass up . A shop called Brain Computer Services was selling brand-name computer programs , such as Lotus 1-2-3 and WordStar , which can cost several hundred dollars in the U.S. , for as little as $1.50 each . During a period of nearly two years , from early 1986 to late 1987 , scores of Americans  --  most of them students and backpackers  --  paraded through the small carpeted store , snapping up cut-rate disks for use on their computers back home . <P> They took away a lot more than a piece of low-cost software . Hidden in nearly every disk was an extra program not supplied by any manufacturer : a snippet of computer code many consider to be the world 's most sophisticated computer virus . Every time an unsuspecting user lent his new disk to a friend or colleague , and every time the disk was run on a machine shared by other users , the code spread from one computer to another . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found its way onto at least 100,000 floppy disks , sometimes with data-destroying impact . In each case the illicit program left behind a calling card for those savvy enough to find it : a message that began with the words WELCOME TO THE DUNGEON , and was signed by two men named Amjad and Basit . <P> Amjad Farooq Alvi , 26 , and Basit Farooq Alvi , 19 , a pair of self-taught computer experts , are brothers who were raised in a middle-class suburb of Lahore . Amjad is the proprietor of the Brain computer shop . By all accounts he is the stronger programmer . After graduating from Punjab University with a degree in physics , he began devouring electronics texts and teaching himself the rudiments of computer repair and programming . For several years , he earned a living by fixing personal computers . By 1985 he had switched to programming , producing customized software that was , to his dismay , copied and used without permission around Lahore . <P> That is when Amjad came up with the idea of creating a virus , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user 's computer , disrupt his operations and force him to contact Amjad for repairs . Says brother Basit : " He wanted a way to detect piracy , to catch someone who copies . " Meanwhile , however , the Alvi brothers had started doing some copying of their own , making bootleg duplicates of American programs and selling them at steep discounts . Eventually , they started injecting the same virus into some of those program disks as well . <P> Some , but not all . When Pakistanis came in for , say , Lotus 1-2-3 , they were sold clean , uncontaminated copies . But foreigners , particularly Americans , were given virus-ridden versions . Why the special treatment for outsiders ? The brothers ' somewhat confused rationalization hinges on a loophole in Pakistani law . According to Basit , copyright protection in Pakistan does not extend to computer software . Therefore , he says , it is not illegal for local citizens to trade in bootleg disks ; technically , they are not engaged in software piracy . Then why infect American buyers ? " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be punished . "
