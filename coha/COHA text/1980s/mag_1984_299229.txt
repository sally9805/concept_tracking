In a distressing horse melodrama mysterious enough for Dick Francis , Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes Winner Swale collapsed suddenly last week . Just eight days after his emphatic four-length victory at Belmont-the 1-mile test of three-year-old champions-Swale returned from an ordinary gallop , reared up , tumbled over and died . <P> The pathologists ' instant guess was that Swale 's heart had failed , but in the autopsy no ruptures or lesions could be found . " We 're really at a bit of a loss now , " said Veterinarian Helen Acland . The brain tissue will not be fully examined for ten days ; complete toxicity tests might take a month . The dark carcass of the son of Seattle Slew was sent to Claiborne Farm in Paris , Ky. , for more than the traditional burying of the head , heart and hoofs . As Claiborne 's only Derby winner , he rated burial in an oaken casket with a silver lid lined in the farm 's yellow racing color . <P> It has been a mean year at Claiborne . The master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main syndicator of Devil 's Bag , thought to be a superhorse last year when a $36 million breeding future was arranged . Following lame three-year-old performances , he was actually declared slightly lame and retired to stud at Claiborne . In Trainer Woody Stephens ' barn and heart , Swale started the year a second-stringer . What Swale 's worth as a stallion might have been and how much insurance covered him are included in the mystery . But $50 million and $15 million are the common estimates . There has been no suggestion of foul play . Said Dr. Robert Fritz , the attending veterinarian : " Sometimes horses die on you , and you never know why . "
