Carter defends his record , attacks Ronnie and looks to the future <P> THE SPEECH . How the triumphant candidate accepts the nomination of his party is always billed by his strategists as not only the kickoff of the campaign but the most important speech of the entire presidential race . Well , sometimes it is all that - and sometimes it is n't . <P> <P> As the campaign film celebrating Jimmy Carter ended and the lights went up , the convention podium remained empty while the band played Hail to the Chief . That void was only partially filled when the chief finally emerged , grinning and waving his arms . Somehow he failed to measure up to expectations . His acceptance speech was not electrifying ; its voltage , in fact , was low . Said Laurence Radway , a professor of government at Dartmouth College and former chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party : " In the past , Carter has been partly an engineer and partly an evangelical - an evangelical engineer . In his acceptance speech , the engineer was there , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , Carter attempted to be combative without totally bringing it off . He managed to defend his record , set up Reagan as a target and project a slightly beclouded vision of the future . But he was unable to generate fervid excitement even among his ardent supporters . As frequently happens to the President , his delivery lessened the impact of his speech ; it read better than he read it . Unfortunately , the line that may be longest remembered was a slip of the tongue . Citing some of his party 's illustrious members of the past , he named " Hubert Horatio Hornblower ... er ... Humphrey . " Carter also went on too long . Toward the end of his 51-min. speech , some delegates were yawning and checking their watches . <P> But the President , whose campaign instincts are often underrated , was aiming not so much at the audience in Madison Square Garden as the one before the TV sets across America . He was not trying to stun or startle them with innovative programs but rather to reassure them with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main objective was to launch an effective attack on his opponent . " This election , " Carter declared , " is a stark choice between two men , two parties , two sharply different pictures of what America is . " Though his portrait of the Democrats was rather fuzzy , he painted a bleak Republican future of despair : " the surrender of our energy future to the merchants of oil , the surrender of our economic future to a bizarre program of massive tax cuts for the rich , service cuts for the poor and massive inflation for everyone . " <P> The Democrats usually pride themselves on being the party of vision while denouncing the Republicans for their lack of imagination . In a curious reversal , Carter compared the Democrats ' earthy realism to the Republicans ' Utopian dreams of a world of " good guys and bad guys , where some politicians shoot first and ask questions later . " This was a forecast , no doubt , of the kind of attack that will be launched against Reagan during the campaign .

He is not sure if he wants to feed them or play with them or fight with them . "
