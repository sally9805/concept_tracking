You do n't have to love opera to like Aria . In fact , knowledge of music drama may prove a liability in appreciating this anthology of ten short films by ten prominent directors , each one spitballing on themes from the opera repertory . If , however , you are a connoisseur of rock videos , with their images like Day- Glo wallpaper after a food fight , you will feel right at home . Watching three of the segments ( based on hit songs from Un Ballo in Maschera , La Forza del Destino and Rigoletto ) , purists could sneer at Aria as MTV  --  Movies Trash Verdi . But Producer Don Boyd and his crew want to revive the old music 's passion and fun , not to mock its petrified conventions . And as often as not , the film succeeds . This is high culture dolled up as pop culture , aesthetics for the anesthetized , opera for the inoperative . <P> Half of Aria 's episodes can be considered briefly and passed over , like the bacon bits at a sumptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes way too long to let John Hurt dress up as Pagliaccio . Charles Sturridge 's essay for La Forza del Destino  --  an urban mural of children 's faces  --  is all dour style , a Bugsy Malone in Nighttown . The Bruce Beresford segment , from Erich Korngold 's Die tote Stadt , is content to watch two young people disrobe in an English mansion . Robert Altman had the inspiration to show a restless 17th century audience at Rameau 's Les Boreades , then neglected to develop his night-at-the-opera sketch with any coherence . Derek Jarman 's episode , to Charpentier 's Louise , imagines an old diva taking a final curtain call , her mind garlanded with fading memories . Sweet but frail . <P> Now for the good stuff . Nicolas Roeg casts his wife , the exemplary Theresa Russell , as King Zog of Albania foiling a terrorist plot to the strains of Un Ballo in Maschera . Jean-Luc Godard sets Lully 's Armide in a Paris gym . Body builders pump iron ; two gorgeous sorceresses dust them off . Murder is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the way a woman 's hair falls across her face . Julien Temple 's witty episode  --  quick gags and endless tracking shots  --  plops Rigoletto into California 's baroque Madonna Inn . A movie producer philanders in a room decorated in Late Neanderthal , while his wife dallies in Heidi 's Hideaway , and an Elvis impersonator lip-syncs La donna e mobile . In another Western hotel , Tristan and Isolde execute a quickie marriage and a slow double suicide . Director Franc Roddam knows that Las Vegas and Liebestod were made for each other . <P> And Ken Russell was made for Aria . The music is Nessun dorma from Puccini 's Turandot ; the images are the last frenetic dreams of a dying woman . Ancient astral priests dress her for a mysterious ritual : paint on her body , diamonds on the soles of her feet , finally a branding iron pressed to her lips . A rude flash , and we see the scene of a car accident . The jewels are mortal wounds , the priests surgeons , the vision one of hope and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russell 's sequence is pitched at see above high- see . Emotionally , it takes preposterous risks and pulls them off .
