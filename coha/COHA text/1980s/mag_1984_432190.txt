 | It 's hard to imagine human history without the dog . More loyal than a Boy Scout , the faithful creature is immortalized in cave drawings and carved onto Egyptian tombs . Even in old-master scenes of Christ 's Crucifixion , as W. H. Auden noted , " dogs go on with their doggy life . " Though the rich and famous long ago made dogs their pampered pets , the commonplace presence of a wellfed pooch as a member of the middle-class family happened to coincide with the beginnings of photography in the 19th century , according to Ruth Silverman , editor of a volume called " The Dog Observed " ( 1 65 pages . Knopf. $25 ) . In her book and an accompanying exhibition that is now at the Dog Museum of America in New York and will travel to nine other cities , Silverman has assembled more than 100 photographs from 1844 to 1983 of dogs and their doggy life . The result is a collection even a cat person could love . What makes " The Dog Observed " so lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captured on film is a range of breeds from a snarling husky to a trio of borzois to an elegant , long-necked whippet ? as well as a vast array of mutts and mongrels so straggly that fleas practically jump off the pictures . Some of them are caught in fuzzy daguerreotype ( most dogs could n't sit still for the long exposure time ) or on old albumen prints , posed like humans on stiff velvet chairs . A sleek greyhound named Maggie was Eadweard Muybridge 's subject for an academic photographic motion study in 1887 ; nearly 100 years later , Leela the Labrador retriever inspired Antonio Mendoza 's intimate , witty series of pictures taken from dog's-eye level . Most major photographers are represented here , but there are some surprising exceptions : Edward Steichen , for example , never photographed his dogs although he owned several , including a three-legged hound named Tripod . The most captivating photographs show dogs with people ; chamele ? onlike , the canines seem to adapt to ? and intensify ? the emotional coloration of the picture . Somehow the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Capa 's touching 1954 war photo deepens the sadness and the fragile sense of a moment 's peace . In the Saturday Evening Post shot of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall at home in 1952 , the three sleeping boxers ? Harvey , George and Baby ? give a Christmascard sense of prosperous well-being . Dogs , of course . reflect their owners : it 's obvious in the comical portrait by Berenice Abbott , taken in 1926 , of a Mme. Guerin. who presses her bulldog to her , literally cheek by jowl . Three-Piece Suit : Many people think dogs are hu man , and some dogs apparently think so , too . " The Concierge 's Dog , " by Andre Kertesz , is leaning on a Paris balcony railing . checking out the street . just as it must have seen its master do a thousand times . But the ultimate attempt at anthropomorphizing dogs is to dress them . The helpless little circus dog in Paul Nadar 's 1890s photo looks pathetic on its hind legs , dressed as a Turk in billowing pants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Hutto 's 1981/82 series , " Dogs Dressed as Men . " Whether wearing a Hawaiian shirt or a three-piece suit , Hutto 's scary , funny hounds seem to have dressed themselves to make us uncomfortable , not the other way around . " The Dog Observed " at its best is hilarious . Man Ray , the Weimaraner immortalized by photographer William Wegman , is an obvious contender for top dog in the humor category . Whether contemplating a bust of himself or posing as onehalf of a set of bookends with a large ceramic cat , Man Ray never loses his air of somber nobility . But maybe the book 's funniest picture is of an underdog ? Elliott Erwitt 's classic 1974 worm's-eye view of a poor Chihuahua standing next to the looming legs of a gigantic dog and its mistress . This hapless creature , dressed in sweater and beret to stay warm , surely must know what humans mean when they say it 's a dog 's life .                @ @ @ @ @
