THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFRIEND writes : About a year ago , with my wife and four children , I moved into an eight-room apartment overlooking the East River . The building was put up by Vincent Astor around 1930 , and until a couple of weeks ago something about the place made me uneasy , but I did n't know what it was . Through the months of painting , planning , decorating , furnishing , and so on , I could n't pinpoint the source of my dissatisfaction . Then I had it : all our brass doorknobs , latches , and other door hardware were tarnished or had been painted over  --  apparently , dozens of times . They simply did n't look right . They nagged at me , and just did n't let me feel right . When this revelation came to me , it was after midnight in the middle of the week , and I was in my pajamas . But I felt driven to immediate action . I announced to my wife , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our door hardware . She said I was crazy , and went to sleep . Feeling possessed by a kind of energy I had n't experienced in years , I got out our toolbox and began with the doorknobs . Once I had got the paint off the various screwheads , I was able to remove every doorknob in the house  --  there were twenty-two knobs . ( Removal of the front doorknobs presented no security problem . We 're privileged to have the only apartment on our floor , and we can lock our elevator . ) To my surprise , the removal took me just under two hours , and it gave me the headiest kind of feeling . For the first time , after four houses and two other apartments in my adult life , I felt that I finally understood the meaning of being the master of any house . I was perspiring , and my pajama shirt was covered with black grease , but I was experiencing an un familiar kind of euphoria . I now went after the latch mechanisms . The first one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with paint , and it refused to come loose even after I removed the screws holding it to the door . I got out my hammer and chisel . It was almost 3 A.M. , and I was perfectly aware of the middle-of-the-night stillness , not only in our apartment but throughout the building and on the streets outside . But I gambled . Ten well-placed whacks , and I was able to wrest the mechanism from the door . My wife did n't even stir ; none of the kids woke up ; no neighbors complained . Doors Two , Three , and Four were tougher than the first , but I could n't stop . I took off eleven of the mechanisms  --  all black metal cases with layers of grime covering them , the word " YALE " barely visible on a couple of them . Grease was thick on my hands , and my pajamas were soaked . I needed to get my pajama top off , and I did n't want to touch it , so I woke my wife and asked her to help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piles of paint chips and dirt on the floor near the doors I had operated on  - -  but we 've both got a lot of confidence in the solidity of our marriage . She helped me get into dry pajamas , and then she went back to sleep . I still did n't stop , however . I went after every piece of door hardware in the apartment . I even removed the doorbell . At dawn , I had a large pile of hardware in the middle of the kitchen floor . I was n't sleepy , but I was hungry . I made a stack of pancakes and kept eating them as the rest of the family straggled in and joined me . By now , ? ? ? ? 1111. my wife had caught some of my exhilaration . After breakfast , she went through the yellow pages and telephoned an outfit uptown that specializes in polishing hardware for motorcycles and vintage cars . We sent all our hardware up there . What those people did n't do to it ! They removed the old paint by dipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece . They removed the scratches with a wheel polisher . They degreased the hardware . They huffed it . Then they waxed it , wrapped it , and returned it to us . You can imagine how wonderful it felt replacing that hardware on our doors . It took me only half a night to put it all back , and I spent the other half just sitting there and looking at it . I 'm at peace with the house at last . Opening THE situation is this : When New York City found itself temporarily short of cash in the mid-nineteen-seventies , all municipal departments had to do some cutting back . The New York Public Library needed to cut a day out of the week ; its officials decided that Saturday could n't he spared , and axed Thursday . But last fall , thanks to the Chase Manhattan Bank , the historian Barbara Tuchman , and two anonymous donors , the Public Library was able to announce that , beginning this month , its general-research collections would once more be accessible on Thursdays . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 10 A.m. , and we were on hand . In the back of our mind was the picture of the first day of the hunting season  --  the thought that precisely at 10 A.11,1. burly men smelling of whiskey and wearing red hats with library cards pinned to the brim would pull up to the curb in station wagons , dash into the library , return shortly with large volumes , tie them to the roof racks of the station wagons , and drive off down Fifth Avenue , whooping and firing their guns in the air . Nothing like that happened . Arriving at the library ' about five minutes early , we found a crowd of sorts milling about at the top of the steps . The first woman we talked to , though , said it was not the innovation that had drawn her to the library that day . " It 's been closed on Thursdays ? " the woman , who was bent on a genealogical errand , asked . " You 're kidding ! I had no idea . That really surprises me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were similarly pleased . Marshall , a student from the University of Arkansas , had travelled all the way to New York to research his Ph.D . dissertation on the impact of foreign trade on the development of market assistance in Nigeria , and he said that except for this stroke of luck it would have been a busted day . An older man named Henry said , " I just come to do research on the markets . Sometimes I would forget and come here on Thursdays , and that always used to really aggravate me . " The most interesting man on the steps told us that his name was John Doe ( but we 'd heard that one before ) , and said that he planned to " find out the rainfall for February and March in Bali , " explaining , " I might plan a trip there , but I want to know how soggy it 'll be . " When the doors opened , the bookish throng surged inside , most of it heading for the public-catalogue room , which adjoins the main reading rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Thursday from the public-catalogue room of the New York Public Library since 1975 was , appropriately , " The Business of Book Publishing , " by a man named Clive Bingley . Soon thereafter came requests for a biography of Hannibal and for a volume entitled " Ample Food for Stupid Thought . " The fourth patron to step to the desk asked for a phone directory for Tampico , Mexico , where his son lives . By ten-thirty , the research room was nearly full . ( Indeed , a total of 5,913 people used the library that Thursday , 4,761 entering through the lion-guarded main door and 1,152 slipping in from Forty-second Street . ) We canvassed some of those in attendance to find out exactly what was JANUARY 24 , 1983 being learned that would n't have been learned if the aforementioned benefactors had not thrown some funds in the direction of the library . The first man we talked to was looking into triclavianism . " That was a school of thought that held that Jesus was crucified by three nails only , and its members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five nails involved , " he explained . A fellow nearby was leafing through lists of bookstores that might want to carry his recently published work , " Critique and Society . " " What 's your book about ? " we asked . " I think the title about explains it ? Critique and Society , ' " he said . We also came across a man who was delving into the history of the clocks on Manhattan 's lower West Side as they relate to the Westway road project ( " I 'm neutral on it . I 'm from Jersey , " the man said ) , a City University teacher working on a book about Jewish Communism in the nineteen-thirties , a Rutgers student looking up books by " a dead psychiatrist named Frantz Fanon , " and a . Peoria professor researching " the several endings of the George Bernard Shaw play ' Arms and the Man . ' " Across the room , a young woman was compiling a list of " films that have already been made on horses . " She added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . There seem to be quite a lot . " A well-dressed man not far away was having similar luck with his quest . " I was just interested to see what the New York Public Library has on calendars , " he told us . " I 'm quite interested in the calendar . " Referring to a large index book open on his lap , he added , " They have hooks from page 413 to page 490 on calendars , This is a great place to find the answer to anything . " Identical sentiments were voiced by another man al the table , who also said he was in pursuit of information about Bernarr Macfadden : " He was a health nut . That is to say , he believed in physical culture . And he published True Story magazine . " Other topics that morning , topics that would have gone THE NEW YORKER unresearched on Thursdays of yore : the history of the Jewish Khazars ; " the collectivist movement of the Knights of Labor and the syndicalism of the I.W.W. as challenges to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irrigation problems in developing countries ; Virginia Woolf 's translation of the " Agamemnon ; " the life of a business associate of John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , named Henry Flagler ; and the effect of sports on the American family ( " maybe if sports reduces crime  --  that type of thing " ) . As we walked back down the wide marble stairs , we met a man in a cowboy hat coming up . What , we inquired , was he using the library for today ? He smiled , and said , " People come to the library for a lot of things . Many come for reading and writing , and all that . Myself , I come here to sit down . " Automobile Show NEARLY concurrent with the departure for Tokyo of some United Auto Workers officials -- eager , we supposed , to study the latest in robotics  --  Lee Iacocca , the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation , threw a cocktail party at the Sheraton Centre Ballroom : seventeen-piece Duke Ellington ensemble with Mercer E. conducting , roast-beef-sandwich bar , steak-tartare bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , they had it . There were a dozen or so highly polished new cars emplaced around the big room , perhaps the most eye-catching of which was a Plymouth Reliant Space Van , red , black , and white , with two video-game consoles in the rear . " If my son saw this , he 'd go crazy , " a strolling woman said . Nearby was a Limousine Version of a Caravan Street Van , long and black , with tinted-glass windows  --  a hearse with seats . Our own favorite , naturally , was the Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue Edition sedan , which , like all the other cars on display except one  --  a Dodge 400 convertible , " Base Retail Manufacturer 's Price Approx. $9,995.00 " ? bore no price tag . Another Dodge convertible , bright red with red-and-green plaid upholstery , had a rumble seat . It also had arrayed in its various compartments six teen-age girls in cheerleaders ' costumes , who , we learned from a hovering Chrysler vice-president , had been imported from Harrison High School in Farmington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the girls was saying ruefully to a bystander , " All we 've had time to do so far on our very first trip to New York was to walk a few blocks down Broadway , and go to Bloomingdale 's . And they 're shipping us back home first thing in the morning . " The crowd appeared to be about half freeloaders and half Chrysler people , the latter all wearing name tags except Mr. Iacocca , who has done so many television commercials he is well beyond the " Do you know me ? " stage . He was wearing a dark-blue pin-striped suit , a blue shirt with a white collar , and a striped tie . His pants needed pressing , but it had been raining outside and this has been a hard time for Chrysler anyway . When we bumped into him , he was engaged in banter with another readily identifiable television personality , George Steinbrenner . A prowling TV crew pounced on Mr. Steinbrenner and asked the Yankee slugger for a few pro-Chrysler words . " I 'm doing this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mood Indigo . " " Generally , I get paid something for it ! " Mr. Iacocca smiled , and we seized the opportunity to solicit an exclusive prediction on 1983 car sales . " I foresee an eight-and-a-half-million market  --  maybe ten million , but I want to be conservative , " he said . " Our share has been ten per cent , and this year we 're going to go for eleven . How 's that ? " ? He turned away to be introduced to a handsome elderly woman in blackand-white fur tails . It was Gloria Swanson . She was clutching a single red carnation . " Mr. Iacocca , " said a man who was steering the actress through the mob , " she 's in this picture and she 's supposed to be driving a Volkswagen , but after seeing your cars she could be ... " Iacocca patted her on the shoulder and left , noncommittally . Miss Swanson , looking remarkably fit for eighty-three , wandered over toward the cheerleaders ' convertible . " I want it ! " she exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rumble seat , but after assaying her chances of doing so in a ladylike fashion she declined . Instead , she delivered a monologue to the young women , of which , through the enveloping din , we could catch only snatches : " No one should ever grow up .... Remember , you 're unique . There 's not another person in the universe like any of you .... You people have been given an unfortunate world to grow up in , because people of my generation , and later generations , have made a mess of this beautiful planet .... I hope you have fantastic lives . " Miss Swanson swept off . " Who was that ? " one of the girls asked a Chrysler man . " Gloria Swanson , " he said . " Who is she ? " " A famous movie star . " Two of the cheerleaders almost r broke their necks vaulting out of the car to run after her for her autograph . Honorable Guess WE have just talked with David Hare , the thirty-five-year-old British author and director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country briefly to supervise the play 's move from the Public Theatre , downtown , to the Plymouth Theatre , uptown , where it has since opened to considerable critical acclaim . " Plenty " is the story of Susan Traherne , an idealistic young British woman who acted as a courier in Occupied France during the Second World War and who finds postwar life in England so gray and oppressive , so disillusioning and materialistic , that she plunges into self-destructive madness ; no subsequent event in her life matches , or even approaches , the emotional impact of her wartime experiences . In order to reach Hare and the Plymouth , we had to walk through one of the most desolate spots in Manhattan today  --  the rubble-strewn wasteland that once marked the site of the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theatres , which have been torn down as monuments to a twisted view of civic progress . An unholy sight , it presents the perfect picture of a bombed-out area in a city that has mercifully been spared terror from the sky . We went through the stage door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we were warmly greeted by George Domingos , the stage doorman . " Mr. flare will be here in a minute . Make yourself comfortable , " he said . " I have worked with Colleen Dewhurst , by the way , in three plays  --  one of them closed here not long ago . She is a grand person . I think you would he more comfortable sitting in the theatre itself . " 1Ve cautiously made our way past some flats and props , down a short flight of stairs , and into the elegant Plymouth , with its red plush seats and huff-colored boxes and almost sensuous air of make-helieve . The curtain was up ; a few technical people were scattered about the house , fiddling with wires . A moment later , a tall , slim man with clean-cut features and wearing black pants and a black sweater walked over and introduced himself as David Hare . lie was soft-spoken but businesslike . " Give me a minute , " he said , and he went up onto the stage , where he greeted an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion , around the stage in circles , first in one direction , then in the other , pointing at various lights and props . One could see at once that this was a no-nonsense man of the theatre . Then he came down from the stage and over to us again . " I am frightfully sorry , " he said . " Now let 's get some coffee . " Leaving the theatre , we stepped , with Hare , into the reality of Forty-fifth Street and then into a coffee shop . " The sight of those missing theatres gives me the frights , " he said . " I hate to see the destruction of any theatre , and especially of a proscenium theatre . When they take down the arch , they are no longer pretending that they are pretending . In Sydney , Australia , they have torn down more than ten proscenium theatres in the past eight years . Deplorable . " We said that walking through the theatre district reminded us of funerals  --  and , incidentally , of a funeral we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate for critics , " said Hare . " At a funeral , a speaker will get up and single out one thing in the life of the deceased , and emphasize it . Someone will say , ' This man saved the whale , ' for instance , and neglect everything else the man ever did . Like critics , funerals expropriate the dead , and turn the dead into whatever they wish to make of him or her . " Hare said that he gets restless the moment a play opens , and instantly wants to be anywhere except where it is playing . " I get out of town as soon as possible . I simply can not bear being around while the play is being performed . In London , I live in a flat in a raffish part of town , near Notting Hill Gate . Right now , I am anxious to get hack to London and direct the production of my new play , ' A Map of the World , ' which will open shortly at the National . It 's about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinate me . The decline of England after the war fascinates me . Ask me where I was born , and I will say at St. Leonards , near Hastings , in Sussex.Then ask me when I was horn , and I will say June 5 , 1947 , the day the Marshall Plan was announced at Harvard . That 's the way my mind works . English audiences hated the character of Susan Traherne . She made them uncomfortable right from the start , when the play opened in London , in 1978 . Kate Nelligan played the part . there , as she does here . She has to build up the character with great care . The seeds of her eventual destruction are much more apparent in England than they are here . Kate is so fine in the part  --  I dedicated the play to her  --  that she often says she fears she will be playing it for the rest of her life . I am not certain what the reaction of American audiences to Traherne will be . I want audiences to make up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an intense feeling against the character in England . You see , I feel that the British walk in a certain way . They hold their heads down in a certain way . They seem to be saying , ' There is no use in doing anything , no point in trying . ' This is something that my character also seems to he saying . Mrs. Thatcher has caught that mood in her people . Basically , she says you ca n't do anything . Her politics have failed , and I am astonished that your President is following the same practices . When Nixon and Ford went out of office , I thought , Now perhaps the United States has a chance . But Carter , who was an intelligent , sensitive man , seemed paralyzed in a funny sort of way . Nothing really worked out for the man . " Americans seem to feel that no laws of nature apply to them . They imply that there will he endless plenty , that nothing will run out , that the rugs will never become tattered or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that has taken a long time to sink in . If ' Plenty ' had been produced here four or five years ago , it would not have had the reception it is getting today . But self-doubt has crept in as a result of Vietnam , and this may be the beginning of wisdom . There is a scene in the play where Susan 's husband turns on her with cold fury . He is a foreign-service officer , and represents to her everything she finds decadent in England . She has been mercilessly tearing him down . Finally , he turns . He says she has ruined his life and hers through her dreadful selfishness . In England , this scene always produced a tremendous emotional response in favor of the man . Audiences were almost unanimously behind him . There was a palpable sense of relief in the audience , a sense that he was at last expressing " Shorebirds of the Bahamas , scram ! " ? ? what they had believed all along . From that moment on , they felt less threatened by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had spoken out . Her threat is dealt with cruelly , almost savagely . American audiences will have to reach their own conclusions . There are many things to be said on both sides of the question . American audiences , incidentally , are not very keen on irony . Americans seem to go more for sincerity , in all its ludicrous forms . Nixon , for instance , was always sincere as well as painfully dishonest . I doubt if the Checkers speech would have gone over in England . " I have been writing plays since I was twenty-two . At first , the words just flowed out . I wrote practically on my knees  --  it seemed that easy . Now the writing itself has become more difficult , but once it is over I find the total experience fantastic , and I can not imagine any other life , a life without it . I guess this gets back to my love of proscenium arches . I am the only writer in my family , but I went to school in Sussex with Tim Rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Lancing College and then to Cambridge . And what did I learn at Cambridge ? Not much . I stayed three years at Cambridge , but the whole climate got me down . Nothing but asthma : all those fens and marshes . " I am dreadfully restless . After Cambridge , I started a touring company . Then I came over here in 1978 and took a beautiful glass house overlooking the sea at Wellfleet , on Cape Cod . Then I moved around again  --  to Daytona Beach and to Washington , struggling with an aborted film . One thing about England  --  nobody bothers you . The day that I sat down to write Plenty , ' I had no idea how the play would end . I had been reading an extraordinary book by M. R. D. Foot . The British Government asked Foot to write the book , and it was published by Her Majesty 's Stationery Office . It is called ' SOF in France , ' SOE standing for Special Operations Executive , a clandestine arm that operated behind enemy lines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce rate among women who had been agents for the SOE was seventy-five per cent ! This is an extraordinary figure , ' I said to myself , and I took off from there . From there , it was a great deal of instinct and not a great deal of research . When I write a play , I feel that if I have a starter , a certain honorable guess , and then move forward in an honest fashion , the play will take care of itself . "
