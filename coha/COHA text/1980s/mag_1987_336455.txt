The initial jolt lasted only ten seconds , but that was enough time for the scary question to race through the minds of millions of Californians last week : Is this the big one , the monster quake along the San Andreas Fault that geologists consider inevitable ? As it turned out , the earthquake was centered between Whittier and Pasadena , 30 miles from the San Andreas Fault , and it destroyed more nerves than it did buildings . Nonetheless , the shock reminded area residents just how quickly the big quake could come . Warned a California disaster-planning official : " This was a little wake-up call . " <P> The quake measured 6.1 on the Richter scale , a small shock compared with the 8.1 horror that hit Mexico City in 1985 and the 1906 San Francisco catastrophe that carried a Richter punch later estimated at 8.3 . Still , last week 's temblor was the most potent in Southern California since 1971 , when the San Fernando Valley rumbled under a 6.6 assault and 64 people died . Last week 's quake left more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairman buried in an underground tunnel , a college student struck by falling concrete in a campus garage , and three people who died of heart attacks brought on by the shock . <P> The quake struck at 7:42 a.m. , shattering windows , snapping power lines , breaking gas mains and igniting fires . Worst hit was Whittier ( pop . 72,000 ) , twelve miles from downtown Los Angeles and the community closest to the epicenter . Eight blocks in Whittier 's business district were closed after bricks cascaded on cars , and at least eight buildings were too damaged to be saved . <P> Modest though it was , the quake strained civil-defense systems and showed that Southern California is far from ready to cope with the dreaded big one . ! However , the jolt seemed likely to create a new eagerness to prepare . " You can have drills and drills , but it 's not reality to people , " observed one emergency official . Last week the quake realities became frighteningly clear to millions in the Los Angeles basin .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
