WHETHER you borrow , buy , or build them , bookcases and their variously cantilevered kin eventually will share living space with you . That 's not much of an assumption , Even video and computer freaks need a way to store the printed-and-bound word , if only for some reassurance that their intelligence is n't entirely artificial .

For the most part , and in keeping with the recessionary times , the suggestions will suit a modest budget ? such as mine lo these many years . THE truly impoverished and those who like to appear so have a couple of minimal- . ist options for storing and displaying books .

This book-slum will house about 100 assorted volumes shelved vertically , plus a few jammed in horizontally , assuming all your books are n't eighteen inches high .

What is n't absolute trash moves out quickly , bookcases included . So the kind of piece you 're likely to see ( and here , settle for nothing less than real wood ) is something that was bought or built to display Junior 's science projects , ended up housing auto supplies in the garage , and along the way collected three coats of paint , the last being navy-surplus battleship-gray for storm-tossed decks .

It 's likely that the other bookcases , including " Genuine Walnut , " are sold " KD only . " KD stands for " knockdown , " which means that these units leave the store unassembled in more easily portable flat boxes .

Pole uprights and shelves lock together quickly with nuts and bolts , requiring only a screwdriver and wrench .

Nota Bene : when shopping for bookcases , do n't buy the ad ; go to the store , with your tape measure , having already measured the space to be filled . Feel the material , check the construction . If the shelves ca n't be adjusted to various heights , forget it or regret it . if the unit 's principal fasteners seem to he big staples , think twice ? that 's fast but cheap . If it 's KD , get a look at the assembly instructions before you put your money down . HARPER'S/ APRIL 1983 B UILDING your own book storage involves spending money , and quite a lot if you buy quality materials or make mistakes . The payoff , naturally , is the abiding satisfaction that keeps the hyphens in do-it-yourself . A popular and inexpensive arrangement is standards , brackets , and boards , because the simple hardware and construction , part of which requires some real tools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected , if not built , something . I know ; I felt that way myself the first few times . Standards are metal runners or uprights that can he mounted on almost any wall . They have vertical slots into which the brackets ' hooks fit , often with a nominal locking mechanism . Put two standards on the wall about I8 " to 24 " apart , insert two brackets , lay a 36 " shelf across the brackets , and you 've got room for thirty to forty books . On the wall near my desk are two five-foot standards fitted with ten 8 " brackets and five 8 " x 36 " shelves . The whole setup would cost $40 to $45 today . And it would easily hold 200 books if I were n't constantly messing about in it . The two minor drawbacks to standards and brackets arc that they often require an electric drill and a confrontation with how walls are made . The standards could be mounted by screwing them into studs , which are vertical boards spaced sixteen inches apart inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found and used studs only once . Another kind of standard , which requires no tools , uses a spring-loaded tension device that works on the same principle as a toilet-roll holder . Hung with conventional brackets and shelves , this arrangement has a freestanding appearance , and it lets you position the standards away from the wall , rather than on it , so that the brackets and shelves extend toward the wall , rather than jutting from it , into the room . That 's an attractive , hardware-hiding arrangement . I know it sounds rickety , and it looks it , too ; but I 've seen such setups carrying the weight of nearly a thousand books , with no sign of impending collapse . A friend who teaches literature and film studies has a standard-andbracket system that looks as if it 's built into the room . The trick , he explains , is to paint the hardware and shelves the same color as the wall . He arranges his books by size , sacrificing some convenience of retrieval ( not all T. S. Eliot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance and maximum use of space . HERE 'S nothing as good for books as real wood . With all the jury-rigged and modular and spongeable options available , most people , given the choice , would opt for yards of solid walnut . But the only way to get it is to build your own bookcases , or get someone to build them for you . Resolute do-it-yourselfers should consult a few how-to books before getting started . Many households already own a home-improvement library ( such as those published by Time-Life or Reader 's Digest ) , acquired at a moment of weakness or ambition while the foundation was still settling . Most public libraries have a good-sized section on woodworking . Buying such books should be a last resort ; they 're often expensive and can be quickly exhausted . A good how-to book should have a generous treatment of fundamentals ? tools , wood , hardware , joints , finishing and photographs as well as line drawings . The suggested projects should range from simple to reasonably difficult . Look first at the plans as you leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea without reading the prose . The plans in some books are limited to an exploded illustration of the piece just prior to completion ; beginners need a more detailed , step-by-step breakdown than that . Look also for helpful hints along the way , end use them . A photograph of the finished piece is more inspiring than a drawing ; a photograph of the piece in a furnished setting is even more so . 71 The following very brief list is culled from my browsing through a library and some bookstores and feeling vaguely ambitious about building something : ? Cabinets , Bookcases , and Closets , by Torn Philbin . Creative Homeowner Press ( Passaic , N.J. ) , 1980. 160 pages . Color , b &w; photos , line illustrations . $17.95 . This is especially good for all the space it devotes to fundamentals , and its numerous photos and illustrations . Suggested projects are rather ambitious , but a few wo n't daunt . ?

More for those who do n't need step-by-step guidance . ? How to Construct Bui and Sectional Bookcases , by Donald R. Brann . Directions Simplified , Inc . ( Briarcliff Manor , N.Y. ) , 1967. 98 pages . Line drawings . $2.50 . This is almost all projects and not much instructional basics . Plans are fairly easy to follow and often include excellent details . Lots of big pieces , but a few intriguing small ones . ? The Sunset series of home-improvement books ( Lane Publishing , Menlo Park , Calif. ) has two hooks worth leafing through . Ideas for Storage is just that , namely , numerous photos and drawings but few plans ; and How to Make Bookcases and Cabinets , which is equally well illustrated but has more plans . Another good " idea hook " is Living with Books , by Rita Reif ( The New York Times Co. , 1968 ; 1I9 pages , b &w; photos ) , which features mostly famous or well-heeled book collectors in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're going to build , keep in mind that even low-grade lumber is costly , as arc mistakes in measuring , cutting . drilling , nailing , screwing , or finishing . Study books and ponder plans and budget . I do n't mean to discourage , but there are a lot of ways to go wrong , and store-bought often ends up cheaper . If you 're intent on building your own , a good start might he a plan in Sunset 's How to Make Bookcases that results in a 24 " W x 8 " D x 72 " H simple bookcase with a small work area near the base , all ingeniously cut from a single sheet of 4 ' x 8 ' plywood . The piece looks easy to assemble , if the cuts arc made accurately , and joining the parts requires only nuts , washers , and bolts , maybe a few nails .

The workmanship and materials will be far superior to store-bought , the fit will be precisely to order instead of standardized , and I 'm told the piece will last far longer . A cabinetmaker who works out of northern New Jersey estimates that something comparable to the walnut veneer unit listed above for $150 would cost $600 if he made it to order . He also proffers step-by-step advice on finding and closing a deal with a good craftsman . 1 ) Get a little background yourself , as a client , on lumber prices and availability . Do n't expect to pay the same price you saw in the store . Custom work is labor-intensive. 2 ) Get at least three estimates for the same plan and materials . Prices vary greatly , even within a small area . 3 ) Talk at length with the carpenter or cabinetmaker . There should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't unusual or offensive , 4 ) Get a written contract , formal or informal , but still fairly specific if the latter . 5 ) If the project 's extensive , do n't be surprised by cost overruns . 6 ) Do n't be in a hurry . Custom work takes time . If you did n't have the piece yesterday , you do n't need it tomorrow .
