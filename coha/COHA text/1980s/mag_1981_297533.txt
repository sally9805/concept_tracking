While the Reagan Administration attempts to mend America 's nuclear-power industry , such extensive repairs are not as yet necessary in other countries . From South Korea ( one reactor ) to the Soviet Union ( 23 reactors ) , the world is still looking more or less confidently to the atom for its electric power . Outside the U.S. , 21 countries now have a total of 182 atomic-powered generating plants in operation , and another 138 plants are under construction . <P> The most advanced nuclear-energy program is in France , where 22 reactors now produce more than 30% of the country 's electric power , the highest percentage in the world . During last spring 's presidential campaign , Socialist Candidate Franois Mitterrand dismissed nuclear power as " costly and uncertain " and promised to delay nine proposed plants . But as President , Mitterrand has curbed his antinuclear rhetoric and now plans to halt only three of the plants . Reason : his government is counting on the energy provided by nuclear reactors to help fuel an ambitious program of economic revival . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country now has 14 operating atomic-power stations , supplying about 10% of its electricity . During a series of recent local elections the new , environmentalist Green Party made impressive gains based largely on its opposition to the nuclear industry . Though the West German government strongly supports atomic power , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt admits he is prevented from moving as quickly as he would like . Says Schmidt : " One can not simply force nuclear energy down people 's throats . " <P> <P> In Japan , where 22 facilities now generate 12% of the country 's electricity , another 15 plants are set for completion by 1985 . Yet a major mishap last March at a reactor in Tsuruga , where a ton of radioactive water leaked into nearby coastal waters , captured national headlines and fueled opposition to atomic power across the country . Japanese officials last year proposed dumping low-level wastes into the Pacific , but an international wave of protest quickly forced them to table the plan . <P> In Great Britain nuclear power is developing at a slow but steady pace . Eleven stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five plants are scheduled to be finished by the late ' 80s . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is ardently pronuclear , though concern for safety is growing . Says a British Energy Department official : " The Three Mile Island mishap caused us to sit back and take stock . " <P> The Soviet Union 's 23 nuclear stations generate 5.6% of the country 's electricity . By 1990 the Soviets hope to meet a full one-third of energy needs in the country 's European region through nuclear power . Yet an occasional dissenting voice can be heard . In October 1979 , Atomic Engineer Nikolai Dollezhal and Economist Yuri Koryakin published an article in the theoretical journal Kommunist that warned against building more reactors in the heavily populated European region . The article 's obvious warning about the safety of Soviet atomic-power plants did not please the Kremlin . A group of top-level Soviet scientists was assembled at an unusual news conference to denounce the article .
