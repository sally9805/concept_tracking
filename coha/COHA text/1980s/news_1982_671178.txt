Then , in the mid-1800 ' s , aspirin compounds that rapidly reduced fevers became commercially available and the medical view of fever changed abruptly . For the next hundred years , physicians and patients focused on bringing down fevers , sometimes with such drastic measures as cold baths and alcohol rubs. // Now , the view of fever is undergoing yet another about-face , thanks to recent research that has in essence documented the benefits suspected by the Greeks . Fever , the studies indicate , evolved at least 300 million years ago in cold-blooded vertebrates as a means of helping the body fight off invading organisms. // The new findings raise serious questions about the wisdom for most people of taking aspirin or acetaminophen for fevers below 104 degrees . Indeed , a number of physicians , including pediatricians , are now suggesting that moderate fevers be allowed to run their course , for they may shorten the illness , potentiate the action of antibiotics and reduce the chances of spreading the infection to others. // These doctors say that fever-reducing drugs should be used with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induced fevers to treat selected illnesses . A form of fever therapy is being used experimentally as part of the treatment for some cancers. // Fever , the new studies show , mobilizes the body ' s immunological defenses against infectious organisms and , in some cases , directly inhibits their growth . Experiments with infected animals , such as fish , lizards , rabbits and dogs , show that those that are allowed to raise their body temperatures are more likely to survive. // In one of the latest studies , people who exercised vigorously were shown to experience some of fever ' s effects , which may account for claims of physical fitness buffs that they are less susceptible to ordinary viral and bacterial infections. // " Fever has a high energy cost to the individual , " said Dr. Matthew J. Kluger , a physiologist at the University of Michigan Medical School and one of the leading researchers in the revisionist view of fever . " For each 1-degree rise in Centigrade temperature , the body ' s metabolic rate increases about 10 percent - heart rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // He added that for this costly response to infection to have been retained throughout the evolution of vertebrates , " it must have a net survival value . " In other words , infected animals that developed fever would , on average , have a better chance of living and passing their genes on to the next generation. // The new understanding of fever grows out of basic studies , sponsored primarily by the National Institutes of Health , that have revealed how fevers develop and what changes they induce in the body . Various substances can prompt the development of a fever , among them viruses , bacteria , fungi , toxins , allergens and certain drugs . When the immune system detects such a foreign invader , a type of white blood cell , called a monocyte , is activated and engulfs the intruder. // The activated monocyte , now called a macrophage , releases a hormone , endogenous pyrogen , or EP , which travels through the bloodstream to the brain . There , EP acts on a region of the hypothalamus that regulates body temperature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " set point . " The body , which now is not as warm as the brain says it should be , feels chilled and , in effect , turns on its furnace to raise body temperature to the new setting. // Nerve messages originating in the hypothalamus trigger rapid muscle contractions , or shivering , which produce heat . Other nerves constrict outlying blood vessels to reduce heat loss to the environment . Body tissues , such as stored fat , are broken down to produce heat . And the sensation of coldness stimulates behavior , such as putting on warm clothes , piling on covers or drinking hot liquids , that also help to raise body temperature. // In addition to its action on the brain , endogenous pyrogen reduces blood levels of iron and zinc . Studies by Dr. Kluger and others showed that fever increases the amount of iron that bacteria require , and the combination of raised fever and lowered iron inhibits their growth . He cited a study among Somali nomads who were iron-deficient . When they were given iron supplements to reach a blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within a month they experienced a significant increase in malaria , brucellosis and other infections , compared with nomads given placebo capsules. // Dr. Kluger noted that the iron effect may explain the persistence and occasional effectiveness of bloodletting as a treatment , since the loss of blood would reduce iron levels in the body. // Joseph Cannon , a doctoral candidate in Dr. Kluger ' s laboratory , showed that an hour of pedaling on a stationary bicycle released a pyrogen-like substance into the blood . The blood then caused fever and reduced iron and zinc levels when injected into rats . The exerciser ' s body temperature also increased and stayed elevated for several hours after the exercise session . <> <> Role in Containing Infection // Studies at Yale University School of Medicine have shown that fever , through the action of endogenous pyrogen , helps to contain an infection , preventing its spread throughout the body . The late Dr. Phyllis Bodel found that infectious bacteria injected into lizards will proliferate if the animals are unable to raise their body temperature ( by basking under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sepsis , an overwhelming infection carried through the bloodstream . However , if the infected lizards are allowed to warm themselves to fever temperature , defensive white blood cells rush to infection and keep it localized , and the animals then recover. // Her studies helped to explain the results of an earlier experiment by Dr. Kluger . Groups of infected lizards were placed in five chambers , each with a different temperature . Since lizards are coldblooded , the chamber temperature determined how hot their bodies could get . Differences in survival rates were striking : Only 10 percent among those kept at a low normal temperature ; 34 percent among those at average normal temperature , and 96 percent of those at fever temperature. // Dr. Bodel , Dr. Harry A. Bernheim , Dr. Elisha Atkins and their colleagues at Yale showed that the net effect of fever is to promote and accelerate the inflammatory response , the body ' s first-line defense against infection . Immunologically active cells called Tcells are stimulated by fever , and they in turn prompt a direct attack on invaders and provoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Dallas indicated that antibiotics destroy bacteria more effectively at fever temperatures . At Wayne State University Medical School in Detroit , researchers showed that reducing fever while giving antibiotics to children with infections prevented doctors from recognizing treatment errors , sometimes with serious detriment to the child . The lowered fever masked the fact that the original antibiotic was not working. // Fever also combats viral infections by triggering production of the virus-fighting substance interferon by infected cells . A study of volunteers infected with cold viruses showed that those given aspirin , which reduces fever , release significantly more viruses from their noses and throats than those given a placebo . This viral shedding increases the chances that they will infect other people and also indicates that their own infection is not being controlled . Lysosomes , which are cellular " suicide bodies , " are also stimulated by fever and may help to fight viral infections as well as destroy tumor cells , which are more sensitive to heat than normal cells are . <> <> Built-in Limit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 102 degrees Fahrenheit , and there seems to be a built-in limit to how high fevers will go . Rarely does a human fever exceed 106 degrees , a level beyond which serious tissue destruction can occur. // Microorganisms , too , seem to have a built-in propensity to induce or not induce fever , depending on their tolerance of raised temperatures . As Dr. Atkins pointed out , " Organisms that are heatsensitive , like the syphilis treponema , don ' t induce temperature that would destroy themselves , but the malaria parasite can survive a fever of 105 or 106 . " Future studies may reveal in which diseases it would be beneficial to induce a fever or raise a mild fever to a higher level. // Fever is not safe for all patients , the experts are quick to point out . The elderly , people with heart disease , newborn infants and others may suffer undue stress from fevers , especially if they are prolonged . Furthermore , very high fevers are likely to cause more harm than benefit , Dr. Kluger said . High fevers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting and undesirable personality effects. // " Clearly , there is some optimum range , with fevers above and below it leading to increased mortality , " added Dr. Kluger , who wrote a book on the subject , " Fever : Its Biology , Evolution , and Function , " published by Princeton University Press . Though further research is needed to define these limits , he said , science is on the verge of verifying the belief of Thomas Sydenham , the 17th-century English physician , who said , " Fever is Nature ' s engine which she brings into the field to remove her enemy.
