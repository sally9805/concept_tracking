Oh , to be 46 and look like Claudia Cardinale . ( Or spend time with someone who does . ) Italy 's President Sandro Pertini recently told a group of journalists that she is the living actress " I admire most in the movies . " But despite their leader 's enthusiasm , Italian audiences and critics have had a more mixed reaction to the star 's latest film , Claretta , directed by Cardinale 's constant companion , Pasquale Squitieri . The comely Cardinale plays Mussolini 's mistress , and some think the movie is too soft on II Duce . " The film is not about Mussolini , " counters Producer Giacomo Pezzali . " It is about Claretta Petacci and her family . We 've concentrated on the love story between Claretta and Mussolini . All we wanted to do was a film about this woman who was so very much like a character in a Greek tragedy .

" My father sees his job as writing . Whether anybody reads his stories , his job is writing them . I see my job as acting .

It will be his Broadway debut , following some off-Broadway and out-of-town stage work as well as a few bit parts in TV soaps . In End Zone , he landed one of the lead roles , playing James Bernard , a talented college quarterback who struggles to reconcile his personal conscience with the win-at-any-cost pressures of his coach . Salinger 's father and mother ( who divorced in 1966 ) have both supported his acting ambitions and promise to show up for one of the early performances .
