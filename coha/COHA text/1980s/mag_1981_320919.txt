STEVIE Directed by Robert Enders Screenplay by Hugh Whitemore <P> <P> Stevie Smith was an English poet who dwelt almost all her 69 spinster years ( 1902-71 ) in a grubby suburb of London . <P> She spoke fondly of death as " a servant " who comes when called , but she flubbed a suicide attempt . Her one beloved companion , an aunt , thought her writings were bosh . In her best-known poem she wrote : <P> " I was further out than you thought/ And not waving but drowning . " A movie about Stevie Smith seems unlikely , but this one is strangely appealing . <P> Stevie awkwardly mingles cinematic language ( flashbacks in sepia ) and theatrical style ( asides spoken into the camera ) . The core of the film - the domestic life of Stevie and her " lion aunt " - is insistently naturalistic , yet Stevie is as cluttered with brickbat metaphors as the cottage parlor is with bric-a-brac . But if the camera eye too often blinks , the film 's mind and heart are humanly acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the detachment of the artist , the terrifying uncontrollability of life . And at the film 's center is the simple trust binding a girl and her aunt . <P> As the aunt , Mona Washbourne has only to loosen her hair and widen her eyes to be transformed from a bustling peas ant into a feeble dotard , nodding off after lunch . Glenda Jackson has specialized in self-absorbed eccentrics , but , as Stevie , she makes the familiar lilts and snappings sound new . Through the subtlest shadings of this fiercely independent soul , Jackson gradually recedes from the viewer 's awareness , and the gentle Stevie takes over . The film 's movement toward American release has been even more gradual ; it was made in 1978 . Now Stevie is here , not drowning but sailing with two splendid characters and performers . <P> - W.A.H .
