Fiction once provided a stomping ground for the crazed or eccentric . When the ideal of civilized behavior combined decorum and good manners , books could offer an escape into the manias of Heathcliff , Ahab and Raskolnikov , or into the stubborn individualism of Gatsby and Huckleberry Finn .

Hannah 's speakers , Southerners almost to the man , habitually treat language as action , words as deeds . Roger Laird , the hero of Getting Ready , worries over his many and expensive failures to catch " a significant fish . " Finally , some 30 miles south of Panama City , he manages to haul in a sand shark from the surf . Though it lacks the grandeur he had imagined , this experience proves exhilarating enough to lead him to his life 's next great task . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stilts and wades around a local lake , screaming obscenities at the rich people in boats motoring by . The narrator of Ride , Fly , Penetrate , Loiter also finds himself in Texas , which offends him : " Dallas , city of the fur helicopters .
