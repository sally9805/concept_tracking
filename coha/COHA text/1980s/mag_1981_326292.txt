" Same goes for Manhattan 's Central Park : " In Madison , it would be condemned . " Nor is the winner of five gold medals fond of being a celebrity : " If I wanted to become famous , I would have stuck to hockey .

Aghast at being tucked between the same covers as those unclad Jezebels , Falwell tried to block distribution of the magazine last week with a court injunction . When that failed , he filed a $10 million lawsuit . Penthouse Publisher Bob Guccione was unfazed . As Falwell desperately tried to soothe his flock , his sometime nemesis Guccione was gleefully predicting that the March issue would sell 500,000 extra copies .
