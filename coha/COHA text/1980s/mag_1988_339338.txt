Jim Hayes ' grandmother Helen , 84 , worked most of her life . Her husband died when she was only 44 , leaving her alone to raise a family of four children . Now it is their turn to take care of her . Growing increasingly frail , Helen moved in with Jim 's parents six months ago in Naperville , Ill. , 28 miles from Chicago . <P> Jim , a 26-year-old manager at the Arthur Andersen accounting and consulting firm , turned to his company 's family-care referral experts for help . They suggested three different senior centers where Helen could spend time with people her own age . Now Helen goes to Ecumenical Adult Care of Naperville two days a week . The socializing has helped his grandmother , Jim says , and gives his mother a rest from caring for her . The referral service , begun by Arthur Andersen in July , researches and outlines elder-care options at no charge . The Hayes family pays for the care , which costs $20 a day .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
