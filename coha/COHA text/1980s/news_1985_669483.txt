Lewis , an accomplished musician who often spends the time between races polishing his own compositions on the piano , has been invited several times in the last few years to play the cello with the Vermont Symphony . But each time the 21-year-old resident of Salisbury , Vt. , has had to turn the offers down . For now , at least , the orchestra will have to be content to play second fiddle to Lewis ' s ski racing career . Bill Johnson will understand. // Johnson was Lewis ' s roommate and everybody ' s first fiddle in Sarajevo , Yugoslavia , in Februry 1984 , after he won the Olympic gold medal in the men ' s downhill . Johnson , the 25-year-old streetwise kid from southern California who brashly predicted his victory , and Lewis , the young , quiet Vermonter , were the only Americans entered in the glamorous event . Lewis finished 24th. // // ' ' Only a few people can room with Johnson , ' ' says Lewis . ' ' I ' m one of them . Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with as long as they get to bed early and don ' t snore. ' ' // The two no longer room together , but that ' s not the only change in their status on the United States men ' s downhill ski team . While Johnson has gone into a bit of a tailspin following Olympic achievement , Lewis has quietly emerged as the new American force in downhill ski racing. // Doug became the first American male skier to win a world championship medal when he captured the bronze at Bormio , Italy , last February , and he also recorded four other top-15 finishes during the season . Meanwhile Johnson , whose brashness and feuds with coaches and other racers on the circuit seemed to earn him more headlines than his racing , was 14th in the worlds and had only three top-15 finishes overall . Thus in the international rankings that determine the all-important start order , Lewis now ranks ahead of Johnson. // This year , for the first time , the World Cup downhill season opened in August with two races in Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t done quite that well in the early European races , finishing 19th at Val-d ' Isfs1ere a week ago and 18th at Val Gardena , Italy , this past weekend . Those were still the best US finishes each time , however , and his 21 points to date ( compared with zero for Johnson and 14 for Lewis himself all last season ) rank him 9th on the overall list at the moment . ; Lewis ' s performance in Argentina ' ' was definitely no fluke , ' ' according to US Ski Team spokesman John Dakin . ' ' It was not a course that particularly suited his style of skiing - there was a lot of gliding in it , ' ' Dakin explained . ' ' It was not a course he should have done well on , but he did. ' ' // Aside from the differences in their personalities , interests , and ages , and their flip-flop in the results column , the skiing styles of Johnson and Lewis are also as different as night and day. // Johnson is a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technician . ' ' No one in the world can ride a flat ski any better or faster than Johnson . Lewis is rapidly proving that few in the world are better than he in the turns of a steep downhill course. // On the steep , icy course at Bormio , Lewis trailed the leaders by more than a second at the halfway mark , but he made up the time in the icy turns at the bottom , to come within 14 hundredths of a second of a gold medal. // Actually , Lewis is something of a Johnny-come-lately to the downhill , regarded as the glamour event of alpine ski racing . Doug , the third of three children , was introduced to skiing in the junior program at the Middlebury College Snow Bowl in Ripton , Vt. , and at 15 was ranked second in the nation in giant slalom in his age group . But later that year , after enrolling in the Green Mountain Valley School ( GMVS ) , a ski academy in Waitsfield , Vt. , he got his first serious taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrating on downhill was a conscious decision on Doug ' s part , ' ' says Bill Moore , one of Lewis ' s teacher-coaches at GMVS . ' ' I think he probably had as much promise in the technical events. // ' ' But success breeds success , ' ' Moore continues . ' ' At that time , anyone who showed good promise in downhill was pushed faster than the technical skiers . They were fast-tracking downhillers then . Anyone who did well in the event was sort of skimmed off. ' ' // Lewis was skimmed off and fast-tracked more quickly than most , although his career was nearly sidelined before it began when he sustained a back injury in a 1981 fall in Aspen , Colo . He recovered , kept moving up , and made the US World Cup team in 1983. // Until Johnson ' s dramatic breakthrough in 1984 , followed by Lewis ' s success last winter and fast start this season , American men had never done well in the highly specialized event that has been dominated by the Swiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis is young for a top downhiller - most of the others are in their late 20s - but he also brings an enthusiasm to the circuit missing among his older rivals . He thinks music will be part of his future , but he isn ' t sure exactly what that future is beyond ski racing . After the world championships , he was featured on Austrian television playing an original composition on the piano which was superimposed over his medal-winning run. // A 1982 graduate of GMVS , he was accepted at Dartmouth College but has deferred admission to concentrate on skiing . He usually spends the off-season , however , in a classroom . Three summers ago he took a total-immersion course in German at Middlebury College so he could converse with other members of the World Cup tour in their native language . Two summers ago he studied creative writing at the University of Vermont . Last summer also marked a new weight training emphasis for him. // ' ' This is one of the first summers I ' ve really worked on weights , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights every other day . I never thought weights made that much difference , but now when I get in trouble I can push it a little bit more because I have that extra strength . It ' s a confidence thing. ' ' // The weight program has added about 10 pounds to his 5-ft. 9-in. , 160-lb. frame . The extra weight has also given him a bit more stability on his skis while hurtling down a mountainside at speeds upward of 60 m. p. h. . // Lewis says he is taking ski racing one year at a time , but he seems to have his sights set squarely on 1988 and the Winter Olympics in Calgary , Alberta . Who will come out on top in those Games that are still more than two years away is anybody ' s guess . Just look what has happened in the two years since Sarajevo. // But for now , the situation that exists between America ' s top two downhill ski racers is one that Lewis is enjoying . Although he seems to be in the driver ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up that claim , Lewis knows that Johnson ' s fame continues to place the pressure squarely on the Olympic champ , leaving Lewis free to play spoiler . So far , he is enjoying the role. // ' ' If I don ' t concentrate on beating people or worry about political stuff , but just concentrate on skiing well , I think I ' ll do well , ' ' he says with what could only be called a boyish grin. // //
