He is , by Washington standards , a little strange . First , there is the uniform draped with gold braid he insists on wearing . Before he became famous , it prompted people at airports to pile him with baggage and ask what time the flight was leaving . Then there is the big , clunky hearing aid that he takes out and fusses with right in the middle of a conversation , as if it were a pipe , and the canvas tote he uses as a briefcase , and his habit of loudly cracking his knuckles . On top of that there are the Old Testament beard and the preacher 's voice that make him seem like Moses come down again from Mount Sinai to deliver commandments 11 through 20 . Smoking ? It 's an addiction that will kill you . Sex ? Only in marriage . AIDS ? The best preventive device is a monogamous relationship ; the second best , a condom . Deformed newborns ? Save them . Sex education ? In the earliest grade possible . <P> You name it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he will give you with great certainty at high speed . There has never been a Surgeon General like him , not even Luther Terry , who slapped warnings on cigarette packs 24 years ago . It 's a fair guess that Terry was never air-kissed by Elizabeth Taylor , the butt of jokes in Johnny Carson 's monologue , was never a visitor to the set of Golden Girls , and never lectured Hollywood producers about showing safe sex in their programs . Antismoking is a small part of Koop 's crusade ; AIDS , child abuse , domestic violence , pornography , old people , drunk driving and Baby Doe regulations made Koop one of the most visible officials in Washington . Now at airports people offer to carry his bags . <P> The 13th Surgeon General , whose second term runs through the end of the year , almost never got a chance to don a uniform . When Koop , a retired pediatric surgeon , and his wife Betty moved to Georgetown in early 1981 to await his confirmation , they became proof of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a dog . The process , expected to take a few days , turned into nine nightmarish months of name-calling and personal attacks , as liberals stalled his confirmation . He was called a right-wing crank , a prolife nut , a religious zealot , inexperienced , Dr. Unqualified ( the New York Times ) , scary ( California Congressman Henry Waxman ) and Dr. Kook . The intensity of the attacks was fueled by prochoice advocates who feared his opposition to abortion . In addition to being the author of several books , Koop was known for an antiabortion film he produced in which a thousand black and white dolls were scattered over the salt wastes of the Dead Sea to represent millions of aborted fetuses . Koop , who became an evangelical Presbyterian in his 30s , explains his views against abortion and against withholding food and medical care from congenitally deformed newborns simply : " If you had led my life , you would understand . " As a pediatric surgeon for 33 years , Koop saved many babies no bigger than his hand . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult cases become happy and productive children . One of these was Paul Sweeney , born in 1965 with twisted intestines , facial deformities and a cleft palate . Koop operated on him 37 times . For the final operation by another surgeon in 1983 , Koop returned to Philadelphia in full dress uniform to wheel his former patient into the operating room . Sweeney recently graduated from West Chester University in Pennsylvania .
