The students are watching the programs on television , through a satellite and cable hookup originated at Columbia University . Twelve colleges have already installed the system and officials at Columbia say 150 other schools have expressed interest in it. // " Study of the Soviet Union in the United States has always relied heavily on printed matter , " said Marshall Goldman , Associate Director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard , which began offering the programs last month . " I think scholars generally feel more comfortable with a newspaper . But more exciting things are going on in the Soviet Union than make their way to Pravda and Izvestia. " // Professor Goldman said that aside from illustrating nuances of spoken Russian , the programs also illustrate the interests and concerns of average Russian citizens , who are interviewed frequently on the nightly Russian news show , " Vremya " or " time. " // Although scholars stress that the news on Soviet television is highly filtered , they note that Russian television often does not censor statements that would be deleted from newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called for self-criticism of the Communist regime because " we do not have any opposition parties . " Pravda , the daily paper , altered the statement to exclude references to the single-party system . The press also deleted a subsequent televised remark by Mr. Gorbachev that referred to a factory operating at only 40 percent capacity. // At Creighton University in Omaha , Neb. , where Slavic studies were terminated in the late 1960s , only one person could be found who spoke Russian when Lee Lubbers , the school ' s Director of Telecommunications , started bringing down the television signal as an experiment in 1982 . When the school ' s 5 , 900 students , 90 percent of whom have televisions , started watching the transmissions in their rooms , the demand for courses in Russian language , culture and politics became so high that the school brought Slavic studies back. // " The students all know how to count to four in Russian because of the morning exercise program . Some now can read the Cyrillic alphabet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all follow Russian hockey and basketball teams. " // Creighton has become one of the two major distributors of the special equipment necessary to track and receive transmissions from the orbiting Soviet television satellite " Molnyia " ( " Lightning " ) which is used to send programs originating in Moscow to the people of the Soviet Union ' s 11 time zones , especially those in Siberia. // Harvard ' s system was installed just in time to watch reports of the Reykyavik summit and has already proven popular with students and faculty , according to Allison Yenkin , a research assistant at the Russian Research Center. // " In one movie , the equivalent of an American Western , they had the cowboys and the Indians speaking Russian . They looked like real Indians , but they were saying ' da ' and ' nyet , ' Miss Yenkin said . She added that students have been impressed by the difficulty of the questions on the lone Russian quiz show , and by the tedium of many of the documentary shows . Daily program schedules often include airings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which announcers rattle off dry economic statistics or boast of the unique productivity levels of the Russian people. // But Soviet television has grown more interesting and sophisticated within the last year , according to Jonathan Sanders of Columbia , assistant director of the W. Averell Harriman Institute for the Advanced Study of the Soviet Union , who has observed the development of the medium for the last three years and who has accumulated a library of tapes. // The influence of Western television also plays a part in the broadening of Soviet television , scholars say . Professor Sanders said the Russians have gradually introduced Western-style color graphics , camera angles and production techniques . Vremya broadcasts , which used to feature a man and a woman reading written texts without emotion , now include details like charts and graphs . Also , the morning exercise show that begins each 15-hour program day now features rock music and computer-generated grapics. // However , this innovative spirit has not penetrated Soviet broadcasts of sporting events . The sound of a game and its audience is interrupted only by the narration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible to bring Soviet television to American households through cable channels , but that copyright laws prohibit the use of the signals for anything but scholarly work . However , a company called Orbita , which has installed the monitoring system at three schools and for private customers , is seeking a contract from Gosteleradio , the State Televison Ministry of the Soviet Union , to bring Soviet television to cable users in New York and other cities for a one-week as an experiment . Orbita already has a limited licence with Gosteleradio to use and distribute the signal to schools. // According to Ken Schaffer , the founder of Orbita , his company now receives both the Soviet channels , Program One and Program Two , by tracking not only the Molnyia satellite but also the geostationary satellite Ghorizont 4 ( " Horizon " ) , which can only be tracked in the eastern half of the United States . Orbita officials say programming on Program One resembles an that of American commercial network in its programming , while the Molnyia satellite ' s channel could be compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia will soon be the only school to track both channels simultaneously. // Orbita charges $35 , 000 , about $15 , 000 more than Creighton Universtiy , to provide the equipment to track Molnyia . The basic equipment includes a 16-foot satellite dish and antenna to receive the signal , and a computer to track the signal , a special monitor capable of reading the Soviet signal format. // Mr. Shaffer said that Orbita can receives television from five South American countries as well as the Soviet Union and France . He said , " We want students in their dorm rooms to have Dan Rather on one channel , Russia on a second channel , and Paris on a third. " //
