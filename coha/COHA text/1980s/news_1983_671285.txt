Such efforts help explain why Mr. Green is no favorite among White House officials . But they also help explain why he has won re-election three times in a district that is predominantly Democratic in registration. // Mr. Green is low-key to the point that he sometimes seems diffident , but appearances can be misleading . He prefers substantive , technical work on specific issues over the type of grandiloquence many Congressmen favor . A graduate of Harvard College and the Harvard Law School , he faithfully reads the Federal Register , the official Government publication listing the minutiae of rules and regulations , and it is not unusual for his staff members to get handwritten notes asking them to investigate items published there. // Mr. Reagan has taken pains to rebut reports that he sees Mr. Green as an enemy . In a letter to the Congressman , Mr. Reagan said such reports were erroneous , and added , " I have deeply appreciated your support when , in your judgment , you could give it . " The President said he had " far too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , to ever mistake disagreement for hostility . " <> <> Advocate of a Nuclear Freeze // On many issues , Mr. Green strongly disagrees with the President and the Republican leadership of the House . He boasts that he was one of just four Republicans who voted for the Democratic-sponsored budget resolution that passed the House last spring . He denounces the Administration ' s military proposals for emphasizing " indiscriminate procurement , " and he says such massive outlays threaten the economy . He opposes the MX missile , the B-1 bomber and new chemical weapons , and he was a co-sponsor of resolutions calling for a freeze on nuclear weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union. // Mr. Green ' s turf was once known as the Silk Stocking District and has been represented by Mayor Koch and John V. Lindsay , a former Mayor , among others . But with the impact of reapportionment as the state ' s population decreased , the individual districts grew in size . Mr. Green ' s territory now includes Chinatown , Little Italy and several large public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the highest per capita income of any in the country ( $15 , 687 ) , but about 15 percent of its residents are poor . The needs of these " statistically small numbers of people may at times be greater than those of the majority , and thus affect a legislator ' s behavior , " Mr. Green said , explaining his support for social welfare programs. // His own family lives on 73d Street off Park Avenue . Typically , he returns there Monday , Thursday and Friday nights , spending only Tuesday and Wednesday evenings here . <> <> ' A Studious Lawmaker ' // Representative Claudine Schneider , a Rhode Island Republican who agrees with Mr. Green on many issues , described him as " a studious lawmaker , one of the leaders of moderate Republicans in the House . " She added : " I look to him for insights on legislative strategy . I might be more aggressive to fight for a point and wish he would be right there beside me . He often has some hesitancy. " // Mr. Green said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city in getting dough , " and he cited his success in winning $500 million worth of Federal tax benefits for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1981 . " Some members like making big speeches on the floor , but that ' s not how you get things done around here , " Mr. Green said. // Brad C. Johnson , director of the New York State office in Washington , said Mr. Green , a former regional administrator of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , had been extremely helpful in getting money for mass transit and housing programs. // But Mark Green , Ralph Nader ' s onetime assistant who ran unsuccessfully against Bill Green in 1980 , had a harsher assessment . " Bill is a hard- working Congressman who has an underwhelming presence in Washington , " said the Democratic Mr. Green , who is no relation to the Congressman . " He just is not a leader in terms of ideas , organizational ability or floor debate . " Representative Green has led efforts to increase Federal spending on research into acquired immune deficiency syndrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> Conservative Fiscal Philosophy // He has opposed many of the Administration ' s environmental policies , most recently criticizing its approach to control of acid rain as too little and too late . But he is more conservative on economic questions than on civil rights , environmental or social issues , and it is mainly his fiscal philosophy that keeps him in the Republican Party . Mr. Green initially supported the budget resolution that Mr. Reagan pushed through Congress in 1981 . But a few months later he began to express reservations about specific budget cuts . Mr. Green also supported the President ' s tax cuts in 1981 and supports the law that indexes tax brackets to offset the effects of inflation. // He has voted for public works and job training legislation designed to combat unemployment . But last month he voted against a major Democratic job bill that would provide $3. 5 billion to create 500 , 000 jobs for people who have been unemployed at least 15 weeks. // Mr. Green has not always been so careful with his own money . The New York State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in response to a lawsuit filed by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company . Mr. Green had guaranteed repayment of loans made by the bank to three limited partnerships in which he had the main economic interest , according to court papers . The partnerships defaulted on the loans , which were used to finance the purchase of aircraft . The Congressman is already raising money for the re-election bid he expects to make in 1984 . Possible Democratic challengers include Andrew J. Stein , the Manhattan Borough President , and Betty G. Lall , who won 45 percent of the vote in an unsuccessful bid to unseat Mr. Green last year . As a liberal Republican , Mr. Green must also worry about a possible Conservative Party challenger. //
