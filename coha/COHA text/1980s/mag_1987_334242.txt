To eager developers , Big Bend conjured up visions of condos and tennis courts : 64,000 acres of wetlands stretching along 60 miles of the Gulf Coast of Florida . Hardwood hammocks , saw grass , palms , brackish scrub . Teeming with many exotic  --  as well as threatened and endangered  --  species such as alligators , manatees , green turtles and bald eagles . Probably the largest plot of undeveloped private property left in the East . <P> Big Bend 's owner , Buckeye Cellulose , a subsidiary of Procter &; Gamble , was asking a steep price . But the coveted land did not end up in the hands of a wealthy developer . It was bought instead by an environmental group , the Nature Conservancy , which in December paid $20 million for the property . <P> Operating quietly and unknown to most Americans , the conservancy has in the ! past three decades bought hundreds of similarly fragile environments . From its headquarters in Arlington , Va. , it now oversees a 2.61 million-acre empire that includes more than 1,000 species of threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-kept secret in conservation , " says William Blair , TNC 's president emeritus . " We are the largest private owner of land sanctuaries in the world , and we are either No. 1 or No. 2 in the amount of money we spend on conservation each year . " Says U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Frank Dunkle : " The conservancy is all action and no talk . While others have been out preaching conservation , they have been practicing it . " <P> Staffers attribute TNC 's success to its philosophy of nonconfrontation . While the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society , for example , employ litigation , lobbying and publicity as weapons , TNC prefers to use gentle persuasion  --  and cash . " We have very little to do with the activist environmental groups , " says David Morine , TNC 's head of land acquisitions . " We stay away from all that and get along with everybody . " The organization has even extended an olive branch to developers , a group that most environmentalists consider the enemy . " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new president Frank Boren , himself a former real estate executive . " We have worked with them and even lent them money . " <P> That cooperation was recently demonstrated near Palm Springs , Calif . Real estate projects with a potential value of $19 billion were being blocked by environmentalists trying to protect the Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard , an endangered species that inhabits the area . After a series of studies concluded that the reptile could survive if a 13,000-acre preserve were established nearby , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asked TNC to help raise the $25 million needed to purchase the tract . Within four years , the organization had rounded up the entire amount . The environmentalists were satisfied , and the developers proceeded with their plans .
