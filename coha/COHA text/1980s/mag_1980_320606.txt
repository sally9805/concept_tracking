The Saudis try to lure Egypt 's Sadat back into the Arab fold <P> " What has moderation achieved ? Is this the West 's concept of a just peace ? , Where is the comprehensive peace framework envisaged at Camp David and promised us ? All the masks have fallen , and the talk about peace with Israel has become a kind of illusion . " <P> So said Saudi Arabia 's Crown Prince Fahd last week in the most ominous Arab response so far to the July resolution by the Israeli Knesset that declared undivided Jerusalem to be the country 's eternal capital . The Saudi prince went on to call on all Arab countries to unite in a jihad ( holy war ) to liberate Israeli-occupied Arab territory and establish a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza , with East Jerusalem as its capital . <P> Mere rhetoric ? Possibly . The Arabs , after all , are in no position to take on Israel militarily . But Carter Administration officials cautioned against dismissing Fahd 's words too readily . The Saudis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some action , perhaps a cut in oil production. * The Saudis saw the Israeli action both as a calculated insult to the Arab world and as final proof that under present conditions the Israelis simply are not prepared to negotiate a Palestinian settlement in any serious way . The Saudi royal family , moreover , looks upon itself as the guardian of Islam 's holy places , which include Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem 's predominantly Arab Old City . <P> The Saudi statement was also designed to step up pressure on Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to abandon the Camp David peace process and break relations with Israel . Shortly after the Knesset 's action on Jerusalem , Sadat shot off an 18-page letter to Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin , explaining that he had no choice but to suspend the Egyptian-Israeli talks on Palestinian autonomy ( see box ) . Sadat 's decision won him plaudits among his estranged Arab neighbors . Morocco 's King Hassan II and Jordan 's King Hussein have joined the Saudis in trying to lure Sadat back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might gain some badly needed oil money to shore up Egypt 's economy . Explained Chedli Klibi , the Tunisian secretary-general of the Arab League , in an interview with TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott : " In Islam we have a saying that if you try and fail-if you recognize your mistake-you will still find your reward . Sadat should recognize the truth and say , ' I 've tried and failed . ' By doing that he would show the world that he gave Israel a full chance to do justice but Israel refused .
