 | THROUGH PARTING CURTAINS OF DRIZZLE the lights of Africa dissolved into the widening gray dawn . Climbing back on deck with course corrections and hot coffee , I watched the last ghosts of lightning dance off the flanks of Morocco 's Jabal Musa just astern . To the east a fine day was building ; already the first breezes stiffened our sails and , gently heeling , our small chartered sloop Nejmah ? Arabic for " star " ? started to gallop . " Perfect weather for a morning 's sail ? or an intercontinental passage , " said my Spanish shipmate , Rafa , beaming from behind the wheel . Here the narrow Gibraltar Strait is one of the few places a sailor can combine the two . The radio forecast confirmed our optimism , and as Rafa eased our bow to 0150 magnetic to allow for the tide , I switched the dial back to Spain 's Radio Flamenco . We scanned the rising mists ahead for our landfall , snapping fingers to a Gypsy guitar . Suddenly our destination raised its sheer silhouette above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonita ! " Rafa exclaimed . " Wow , what a beaut ! " A beacon for mariners since the dawn of seafaring , the famous Rock was one of the Pillars of Hercules ( Jabal Musa , twice as high behind us , formed the other ) . For the ancients they marked the boundary of the known world . To the occupying British , strategic " Gib " with its history of heroic sieges remains a monument to empire . Spain vociferously claims the tiny peninsula , a natural extension of its own soil . Rafa ? Rafael de Tramontana y Gayangos , the Marquis of Guadacorte ? measured the scene with his own thoughts . Before Spain lost Gibraltar to England in 1713 , the Guadacortes ruled hereabouts . A grandson of Dr. Pascual Gayangos , Spain 's first modern Arabist , Rafa now presides over the Fundacion Gayangos , a Madrid-based institute to promote cultural exchange between Spain and its Muslim neighbors . For me the stronghold marked the first stop on a journey into a neglected corner of Europe 's history , a distant time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . The creed of Islam had been revealed to the seventh-century prophet-statesman Muhammad in distant Arabia . It spread swiftly , embracing the entire desert peninsula by the time of his death in 632 . Six years later Syria and Palestine fell to the zealots . From their new capital in Damascus , Muslim armies fanned eastward through Mesopotamia to India and Central Asia , westward to the Nile and across North Africa . A century after the birth of Islam , its call to prayer rang from minarets all the way from the Atlantic to the outskirts of China , an empire larger than Rome 's at its zenith . History named these Muslim conquerors of Spain " Moors , " probably because they arrived by way of Morocco . The Moors themselves never used the term . They were Arabs , from Damascus and Medina , leading armies of North African Berber converts . Most married into Spanish and Visigoth families or took fair-skinned Galician slaves to wife ; soldiers all , they brought no women with them . From this heady mix of race and culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 900 years , one that would change the face ? and the soul ? of Spain forever . Rafa and I were bobbing in the wake of Tariq ibn Ziyad , a Muslim general . With soldiers and horses in four borrowed boats , he crossed from Ceuta on the African side ? as did we ? and set up his beachhead on the narrow ledge below the Rock where the town of Gibraltar  | huddles today , then dispatched the tiny fleet back to ferry the rest of his army . In the spring of 711 , Tariq marched northward from Gibraltar with 12,000 Muslims . At the Rio Barbate , south of Cadiz , the invaders met the hastily gathered forces of Spain 's Visigoth king , Roderic . " Before us is the enemy ; behind us , the sea , " shouted Tariq , drawing his scimitar . " We have only one choice : to win ! " For an already faltering Visigoth rule , the battle of Barbate proved the mortal wound . King Roderic was slain ; his body was never recovered . Whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic conquest of Spain was thus set in motion . " Only recently have the Spanish begun to approach their Islamic past , " Rafa said . " We take pride in our sangre pura , pure blood . No Catholic wants to face the thought of Moors on the family tree . " But we are finding that much of what we think of as pure Spanish , ' our architecture , our temperament , our poetry and music ? even our language ? is a blend from a long Arabic heritage . " In the weeks ahead I would find even more marks of the Moors on the face and heart of Spain . ONLY TWO HOURS from the African coast we sailed Nejinah past Europa Point Light and into the lee of the Rock to tie up at Marina Bay , just below the lofty Moorish castle built by Tariq 's successors . Shops , warehouses , traffic-clogged streets , quays , and dockyards now cover any traces of the first Arab conquerors , all except one : The name Gibraltar descends from jabal Tariq , Arabic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab fortress with a knowledgeable Gibraltar friend , Richard Garcia , a former schoolteacher with a passion for the history that crowds his town . Along the way Richard showed me Moorish walls , traces of an Arab gate , the domed baths now housing Gibraltar 's small museum . Narrow lanes and steep stone steps led us up a block of modern high rises that today fills the large castle yard to the 80-foot-high tower that dominates the town and its harbor . " Abu al-Hasan , a Moroccan king , refurbished the tower in 1333 , and he built it to last , " Richard said , pointing out small starburst patterns that pocked the ramparts . " Cannonballs barely scratched the ten-foot-thick walls . " The tower suffered 14 major sieges , " he said . " Several times its defenders were starved out , but no army ever took it by force . " I was surprised to find the fortress still inhabited . The high-walled keep , just below the tower , serves as Gibraltar 's lockup . Douglas Gaetto , an officer at the jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be the world 's smallest soccer field , squeezed into the prison yard . In cellars below we prowled rows of dungeons used for solitary confinement until the turn of the century . They faced on to a gallows courtyard and a lime pit once used to reduce corpses of the condemned . " We have only eight guests ' at the moment , small-time smugglers mostly . All short-termers , " Officer Gaetto said . " We are looking forward to newer , larger quarters . Money will surely be appropriated . The problem is ? as always on this tight little island ? where to build it ? " Gibraltar 's claustrophobia was aggravated during Spain 's 16-yearlong closure of its narrow land border , a ban lifted only in 1985 . At his National Geographic , July 19b  | office I talked about the isolation with Jon Searle , then editor of the Gibraltar Chronicle . " We are 29,000 people perched together on two and a half square miles of cliffs and beaches , " Searle said . " The blockage deepened our siege mentality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And of Spain 's oft voiced claims to the Rock ? " The British Empire is history now . In the age of the missile , Gibraltar 's strategic value has dropped , " Searle said . " Britain just might be happy to let Spain have it . But how can it , really ? We Gibraltarians are bilingual , our culture tied to both Spain and England . But we prefer to remain under the Union Jack . In a recent referendum only 44 voters cast their lot with Spain . " STILL MARVELING at the vagaries of history , I followed the conquering footsteps of Tariq ibn Ziyad northward . After the victory at the Rio Barbate he had moved swiftly . One by one the Spanish cities fell to him , often betrayed by their own citizens long chafing under the Visigoths . Early in 712 , after a perfunctory siege , his Muslims galloped through the gates of the Visigoth capital , Toledo . The Christian armies , those left , were pinned in the northernmost mountains of Spain . Hemmed by walls , moated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly 400 years a stronghold of the Moors , who spun its tangled web of steep streets and narrow plazas . Its role as a border fortress is today recalled by the huge military school that sits atop an adjoining bluff . In 1085 Alfonso VI of Castile and Leon wrested the city from the Moors ; the Reconquista , or Reconquest of Spain by the Christians , had begun in earnest . But for several centuries after Toledo 's recapture , the city remained bilingual , tolerant . Alfonso X patronized an important 13th-century translation school where Christian , Muslim , and Jewish scholars collaborated to render Arabic manuscripts into Latin ? masterpieces like the commentaries on Aristotle by Ibn Rushd ( Averroes ) ; works on algebra and mathematics by al-Khwarizmi ( from whose name comes our term " logarithm " ) ; and the Canon of Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) , which remained Europe 's standard medical textbook for 500 years . Christians raised a cathedral befitting a capital of Castile and dozens of churches and convents . Toledo remains the country 's religious capital ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synagogues and mosques have been restored and splendid palaces opened to the public ? museums to display Toledo 's abundant heritage . The whole city has been officially declared a national monument . Artists and artisans , plying old Moorish crafts , still prosper . On Calle Santo Tome a shopwindow sparkling with gold drew me inside to the friendly workbench of master craftsman Modesto AguadoMartin . With a jeweler 's hammer and steel point he deftly laid 24-carat thread into delicate patterns scored on a black iron platter . " We turn out Madonnas , Bible scenes , and Star of David motifs , all popular with tourists who day-trip down from Madrid , " Senor Aguado said , tapping away . " But , as you see , we specialize in arabesque designs . " The art of damascene , as its name implies , came here from Damascus , " he continued , the tiny hammer never missing a beat . " This  | is an authentic Toledo design ; it could have come from the dome of a tenth-century mosque . Pure Arabic . " A local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum he helped restore , the Taller del Moro , literally , the " Moor 's workshop , " although it never served as such . It was built during the 14th century as a palace in Mude jar style , a lavish blend of Arab and Gothic architecture that graces many Spanish monuments . Its high salons , arches , and alcoves were worked in yeso , an art the Arabs mastered , carving plaster walls with breathtaking patterns of flowers , geometrics , and calligraphy . " Yeso is a demanding medium , requiring patience to master and speed to execute ; the carving is intricate and must be finished before the plaster hardens . " I studied the technique here at Toledo 's School of Applied Arts , " Revenga said . " Now I 'm teaching it here . We must preserve this art ; Toledo has dozens more Arab-style buildings ? throughout Spain there must be hundreds ? that need loving care . " The darker side of Toledo 's past chilled my last afternoon in the city ? an exhibit of old torture implements at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rack , branding irons , skull squashers , thumbscrews , an iron maiden . The grisly display was assembled , according to the city 's Council of Culture , to remind us that even today " human beings are victims of physical and psychological torture in many parts of the world .... " I retreated back into Toledo 's quiet gray streets dogged by ghosts . It was here , long after Alfonso VI , that the first victims of a growing Christian bigotry perished at the stake . In 1469 Prince Ferdinand of Aragon wed Princess Isabella of Castile ; the marriage would unite Christian Spain under their rule . While waging war against Moorish potentates to the south , they would view as a threat Muslims and Jews in their own lands . In 1480 they established the Spanish Inquisition . Before it was over , three centuries later , thousands of Muslims and Jews had died ; an estimated three million people were driven into exile . Shorn of its leading businessmen , artists , agriculturists , and scientists , Spain would soon find itself victim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andalusia brightened my mood . Here , across the warm , undulating landscape that nurtures rows of grape vines and olive and citrus trees , Islamic culture sank its deepest roots . Small wonder . Mediterranean Spain is a mirror of Morocco , a close cousin of the Levant . Here the Arabs felt at home . Indeed to a desert Arab , Andalusia ? from the Arab al-Andalus ? competed with descriptions of heaven in the Holy Koran : " gardens dark green . . . springs pouring forth ... fruits and dates and pomegranates . . . . " In 756 Prince Abd-alRahman , who had escaped massacre when his dynasty was overthrown in Syria , planted his capital at Cordoba on the fertile banks of the Guadalquivir ( from the Arabic al-wadi al-kabir , great river ) in Andalusia 's heartland . Under Abd-al-Rahman III and his successors , 150 years later , C6rdoba blossomed into a metropolis of half a million with , according to contemporary chroniclers , 21 suburbs , 500 mosques , 300 public baths , 70 libraries , and miles of paved , lamp-lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood with Baghdad and Constantinople as one of the great cultural centers of the world . National Geographic , July 1988  | Cordoba 's pride today is its venerable Mezquita , or mosque , which in 1986 celebrated its 1 , 200th anniversary . Begun by the first Abd-alRahman , it was enlarged and embellished to become what is considered today the epitome of Moorish architecture . From its quiet Patio of the Orange Trees , past fountains where the faithful once performed their ablutions , I entered the 600-by-450-foot shrine , rivaling in size Islam 's holiest in Mecca . As my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness , I wandered through the forest of jasper , marble , and porphyry columns , some 850 , that support the tracery of double-tiered Moorish arches . Nineteen doorways , before they were walled up , let in light and air and extended the theme of the columns to the rows of orange trees in the courtyard . My footsteps led me to the mosque 's domed mihrab , or prayer niche . From behind its scalloped marble arches , amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once led Friday prayers . Flowing Arabic calligraphy adorning the walls exalted Cordoba : " . . . praise to Allah who led us to this place .... " In the dim vastness I hardly noticed the cathedral . After the Christian Reconquest , Catholics reconsecrated the Mezquita as a church and for 300 years held services there . Then the clergy persuaded Emperor Charles V to raise a cathedral in its midst , despite strong protests from city leaders . Later , inspecting the baroque incursion , Charles confessed disappointment : " By installing something that is commonplace , you have destroyed what was once unique . " From smaller parish churches issue the spirit and spectacle of Cordoba 's Semana Santa , or Holy Week . Thousands of C6rdobans line narrow streets and wrought-iron balconies to watch the processions . Their religious intensity reflects the passion that drove medieval Christians to oust their Moorish occupiers . Twenty churches participate , circulating about 50 pasos , or platforms , set with ornate statuary . " Different scenes each day recall the Madonna , the Last Supper , the Crucifixion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prieto Rico . We finished our fried squid and garlic shrimp at El Triunfo , a small restaurant near the Mezquita , then wedged into the throng at the Plaza de las Tendillas to witness one of the processions . To the beat of distant drums , the solemn escort arrived : files of 200 or more penitentes , ghostlike in long robes cinched with ropes and tall pointed hoods . Most carried long flickering tapers or swung smoking silver censers ; others bent under heavy oaken crosses . Behind marched women of the parish veiled in black lace mantillas . The drums grew louder as the paso appeared from around the corner , in a blaze of light , swaying with the measured footsteps of some 30 bearers straining beneath it . The life-size Virgin sat draped in lace and rich brocades above banks of fresh white roses that perfumed the air . A hundred enormous candles set her silver halo aglitter and caught the sparkle of tears on her radiant face . The drums stopped , the paso paused , and suddenly a woman in the crowd broke into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Andalusia is famous . The words were Spanish , but the mournful melody echoed Arab and Gypsy origins : Like the precious stones of a jeweler , The tears that flood your lovely eyes . . . . The stunning solo had its effect ; throughout the applauding crowd  | around me I saw many eyes moisten as drums took up the beat and the paso moved on into the night . THE QUIET COOL OF MORNING is the time to stroll Cordoba . After a strong , black cafe solo at the Bar Mezquita , I followed one of the twisting cobblestone lanes that fan outward from the mosque through the medieval Muslim quarter , some so narrow that a stretched handkerchief spans their walls . They lead to small plazas , some holding statues of Cordoba 's famous sons : the Roman Seneca ; Arab philosophers Ibn Hazm and Ibn Rushd ; Maimonides , major Jewish scholar of the Middle Ages ; the 15th-century general , Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba , " El Gran Capitan " ; Manolete , greatest of bullfighters . Potted geraniums and carnations splash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On many of the massive wooden doors , as on those in Fez or Damascus , hang heavy iron knockers in National Geographic , July 1988 When the Moors Rail the form of a hand ? the hand of the Prophet 's daughter , Fatima , according to one legend ; another says the fingers recall the Five Pillars of Islam : the creed , prayers , alms , fasting , and the pilgrimage to Mecca . As in Muslim cities , a Cordoba house acknowledges the outside world only begrudgingly through small windows , iron-grilled and shuttered , turning its attention inward to the center of family life , the patio . At Number 8 , Pozo de Cueto , near the river , I got out my key and let myself in . " I can not imagine a house without a patio , " said my landlady , Senora Antonia Ortiz de Mahn , bringing coffee and small glasses of amontillado , the local dry sherry . Now that the children were grown , she and her husband , a retired policeman , rent rooms during crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small space , could we have had a private garden in the city ? " she said . " A safe place for the children to play ? " Our patio was typical . Entered through a Moorish arch , it was @#  | paved with arabesque tile work and softened by flowers , an herb garden , and orange trees set in pots around a fountain . I recalled that one of the Arabic words for home was muskin , from the same root as sakun , peace . Even in the heart of the city , my room looked down on a tranquil world of its own , under a private square of blue sky . Of the extensive royal architecture that once crowded Muslim Cordoba , little survives . By far the grandest palace , a Versailles of its time , was built by Abd-al-Rahman III five miles northwest of the city at the foot of the Sierra Morena . For 25 years , until its completion in 961 , he lavished on it a third of the royal budget , naming it Madinat alZahra , the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son and successor , al-Hakam II , it grew into a small city ; double walls , each as thick as 15 feet , enclosed half a square mile . According to one account Hakam 's family , his generals and viziers , scribes and translators , workmen and shopkeepers gave it a population of 20,000 . The royal bodyguard added 12,000 ; the harem , 6,000 more . " There was nothing visible when archaeologists arrived in 1910 , " said Antonio Vallejo , director of excavations , when we walked together down the terraced palace grounds . There were cypress and olive trees , a litter of fallen columns and capitals . " Foundations outline the caliph 's mansion , the mosque , 400 houses , the ancient market , aqueducts , formal gardens , pools ? even a zoo , " Vallejo said . " We have restored one of the buildings , the magnificent audience hall . " Amid its tattered splendors , where Hakam once received embassies from Europe and the East , I conjured up scenes from the Arabian Nights of turbaned notables and veiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision coming through an archway , a tall Moor in white robes and pointed black beard . " Salaam Alaykum ! " he bowed , " I am Hakam II ? of course , just for today . " Francisco Bernal Garcia , an actor from a local troupe , smiled . We were soon joined by a dozen of his colleagues , taking their places on thick cushions set on sumptuous carpets in the center of the marble floor . While a television crew arranged its lighting , several hundred ten-year-olds filed noisily into the chamber , girls costumed in makeshift veils and slippers , the boys sporting burnt-cork goatees and cardboard scimitars . " We are reenacting Caliph Hakam 's reception for emissaries of king Ordono IV of Leon in 961 , " Francisco explained . " It is part of a program to bring history to life for Cordoba 's schoolchildren . " But Madinat Al-Sahra underscores another of history 's lessons : Even great powers are mortal . Barely 50 years after its completion , the great palace lay sacked and leveled , as the caliphate dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed , many Muslim rulers became clients of northern Christian princes , and religious boundaries often became obscured . The famous Christian knight El Cid ( his nickname derives from the Arabic al-sayyid , lord ) changed allegiance with the gusty political winds , now to fight for the emir of Zaragoza , now to help a Christian king , now to rule over Muslim Valencia . The fall of Toledo drove Spanish Muslims to desperation . They sent for armies of the Berber fundamentalists , the Almoravids , who ured in from Morocco to stem the Christian advance . But they soon  | seized power for themselves to unite Muslim Spain with North Africa , which they ruled from their capital in Marrakech . Gradually these desert warriors succumbed to Moorish luxury , and half a century later another wave of North African puritans , the Almohads , crossed the strait to supplant them . In 1170 the Almohad ruler , Yaqub Yusuf , moved the Spanish capital to Seville . Sweeping views of Seville can still be enjoyed from Sultan Yaqub 's minaret , one of three sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marrakech . From 20 stories up the eye pans from the red-tiled roofs of Seville 's medieval hub to the distant rim of modern apartment blocks and factories and beyond to the glowing countryside that nurtures Andalusia 's largest city . When Christians destroyed Yaqub ' s mosque , they spared his minaret and topped it with a belfry and the giant bronze weathervane , or giralda , that gives it its popular name . Today La Giralda serves as the steeple for the largest Gothic cathedral in Europe . Seville , in one word , defines Spain . That is the reason why Bizet chose it as the setting for his opera Carmen . And why romantics like myself are drawn back ? to the spectacle of the bullfight at the Plaza de la Maestranza , where glittering matadors perfect their cruel ballet of bravery and death . Or to clap our hands to the rhythms of guitars and staccato heels during a Gypsy lament : A woman is like your shadow . Pursued , it runs away , Ignored , it follows you ... . Or even join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirl through a sevillanas , the folk dance popular now all over Spain . Or just relax by the whispering fountains under the peach trees in the gardens of the Alcazar . Within its high walls the Christian king Pedro the Cruel erected in the 1350s his own palace . He imported Muslim architects from Granada , whose designs reflect the cultural overlap of the times . Escutcheons on the walls of the royal bedchamber feature the lion rampant of Leon and the towered castle of Castile emblazoned with Arabic script : Glory to our sultan Don Pedro . Allah aid and protect him . " Seville 's Alcazar is the finest example of Mudejar architecture in Spain , " curator Dr. Rafael Manzano said . " But it is more than just a museum . It is the royal residence whenever the King visits Seville . " Dr. Manzano recounted the legend of the Alcazar 's peach trees . " A romantic 11th-century ruler , al-Mutamid , also famed as a poet , married a northern beauty . Although happy as queen , she pined for the snows of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered the gardens of the Alcazar planted with wild peach trees . Each spring , 's eternal snows , the drama of the Moors was to play itself out . When Cordoba fell to the Christian Reconquista in 1236 and Seville 12 years later , Muslim lands shrank to a 200-mile-long bastion in Spain 's rugged southeast , curving from Gibraltar to past Almeria . Here sultans of the Nasrid dynasty ruled from their stronghold at Granada . From 1248 to 1354 they raised their masterpiece , a palace-fortress , the Alhambra . Today from its high hill , Sabika , the clay-red Alhambra ( from National Geographic , July 1988  | the Arabic al-hams , the red one ) looks down on two Granadas . One is the sloping Albaicin quarter ? austere , labyrinthine , Moorish . The second is the newer city ? noisy , businesslike , baroque ? that sweeps along broad boulevards out onto the Vega plain . From the rooftop of restored Moorish house in the heart of the Albaicin , Professor iguel Jose Hagerty and I enjoyed a sweeping view of the Alhambra. rn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agerty graduated from Notre Dame , where he majored in Islamic Studies . He now teaches Arabic and lectures on Arabic poetry at the University of Granada . " Arab Spain nurtured scores of poets . Many of its rulers ? alMutamid and Abd-al-Rahman I , for instance ? were poets in their own right , " Professor Hagerty said . " Strict Islamic tradition discourages the making of graven images , ' so painting and sculpture never flourished among the Moors . Instead they channeled creative energy into language . With its wealth of vocabulary , its sonorous sounds , its flowing calligraphy , Arabic is well suited to the task . " Little has been translated , " he said , but he recalled lines that survived the journey into Spanish and English . From Ibn al-Sabuni : I present you a precious mirror , Behold there the beauty that consumes me O furtive love , your reflection is more yielding And better keeps its promises ... . Then he countered those lines with a stanza by another Sevillian romantic , Ibn Ammar : Slaves in the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I climbed to the Alhambra . The lofty  | mansions of the Nasrid sultans make up the most visited site in Spain . It is a miracle that they survived the centuries . They were defiled by squatters , eroded by neglect , brutalized by Charles V 's massive Renaissance addition ? a brick among lace pillows ? and confounded by misbegotten restorations . Nevertheless the Alhambra endures , a sublime Oriental meld of artifact and nature . Here the walls themselves speak ? if you know Arabic . We traced out poems in the supple calligraphy of the friezes , archways , and fountains . In the upper gardens we found a couplet by Ibn al-Yayyab that praised Allah for providing the sparkling palace with ... its light of virtue And the peace of its shadows ... A marble fountain bragged , No greater mansions I see than mine No equal in East or West . I had to agree . Even in the oil-rich Arab countries of today architects with unlimited budgets have yet to match the Alhambra . ARABIC POETRY was crafted , above all , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muwashshah , some say , inspired the first ballads of the European troubadors . The soul-stirring adagios of cante jondo , the deep song of Gypsy flamenco , still trace moods and rhythms to this lost age . Jaime Heredia , a local flamenco singer , told me : " A Moroccan orchestra recently came to Granada to join us in concert . It wasfantdstico . We were up half the night playing encores . " I had missed that concert , but in Fez and Tetuan I had heard that music , the same melodies that once entertained courtiers in the Alhambra , played and sung by the descendants of Spanish Muslims expelled during the Inquisition centuries ago . They still convene regularly to keep alive their musiqa al-andalusiyyah . " We had language problems , of course , " Jaime said . " But we agreed on one thing : Musically we were brothers . " Throughout Spain today the art of flamenco is being threatened  | by its commercialization in floor shows called tablaos ; these count on dramatic lighting , amplifiers , and curvaceous dancers to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallmark , its duende : soul . But a night owl can still sample flamenco puro when Gypsies gather at Jaime Heredia 's bar , La Fuente , in Granada 's Albaicin for a misa de doce , literally a " midnight mass , " slang for a flamenco bash . Well after midnight young Bautista arrived with his guitar , the sign for Jaime to close up shop and aficionados to gather . A small , broadshouldered man in sweater and jeans , Heredia did n't look " flamenco . " Where was the flat hat , the bolero jacket , the high-heeled boots ? No matter . The guitar starts to ripple . Snapping fingers pick up the beat of afandanguillo , and Jaime 's voice lights up the darkness : A chorus of children 's laughter Flows past an unseen river Bittersweet strains recall a former love . The guitar fires another fusillade of minor chords , stopping everyone in mid-drink . Jaime presses his hands together . Sweat gathers on his brow , veins on his neck bulge , and the powerful voice again stabs the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words , stylized , blurred , are lost to my untrained ear , but closing my eyes , I hear an Egyptian chanting from his minaret . What about the lyrics ? I pressed Jaime when the session finally broke up . It was daylight now , and regular breakfast customers were already demanding their coffee and brandy . " Not easy , senor , " Jaime apologized . " The song is about love and death and God ? A , but no one could understand who was not suckled at a Gypsy mother 's breast . "  | THE REMOTE VILLAGES of the Alpujarras , halfway up the southern flank of Mulhacen , Spain 's highest peak , were the last domains of the Moors in Spain . Many towns like Beninar , Almocita , Bubien , and MecinaAlfahar still wear their Arabic names , as does Mount Mulhacen ? and the Alpujarras itself . The marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella sealed the fate of the faltering Granada sultans . Catholic Spain , finally united , continued to force the Muslims toward the sea , town by town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus on his historic voyage , Their Catholic Majesties rode into Granada to preside over the abdication of the last Moorish ruler , Muhammad Abu-Abdullah ? Boabdil , as the Spanish call him . On the way to the Alpujarras , I paused above Granada at the pass called Suspiro del Moro , the Sigh of the Moor . It was here Boabdil stopped to look back and shed a tear over his lost kingdom . According to legend his domineering mother , Aisha , berated him : " Fitting you cry like a woman over what you could not defend like a man . " For a century more , Muslims held the Alpujarras 's rocky folds and raided into the Christian lowlands , often igniting rebellions , until the last of the Moors were driven into exile in 1609 . The autumn day breaks late over the valley 's brim at mile-high Bubion , waking the village slowly . I rubbed my hands together against the chill as I left my small pension . The first wisps of smoke drifted from conical chimneys atop slab roofs that staircase down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I set off on horseback with a farmer , Antonio Jimenez Estevez . We rode upward over narrow terraces through the last warm colors of autumn ? orchards of red-leafed cherry trees and golden chestnut , bordered by yellow poplars and evergreen . For a while we followed the gravel way , Europe 's highest motor road , that leads to 11,000-foot Pico de Veleta ; then we turned off along a medieval acequia , or irrigation canal . It brought us , after a mile or so , to a stone reservoir called , in Spanish , an alberca . The old watering system ? and its Arabic-derived nomenclature ? was still in use . " This is one of three canals on this side of the Poqueira Valley built by the Moors , " Antonio said . " Twenty years ago , when I was a boy , we still ran water mills on this one . " Now there was also a modern dam , a small hydroelectric plant , a larger canal . @#  | We crossed a stream and walked our horses to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the stone hut that serves as summer camp for the Jimenez family 's upper fields . We sat under a walnut tree on the edge of the threshing circle while Antonio 's young nephew , Jose Luis , hitched a team of mules to a wooden plow . Fall plowing would be the last chore before closing camp for the winter . A cousin waved a loud " jHola ! " as he set off walking , in a cloud of dust and tinkling of bells , toward Mulhacen with the family 's 400 sheep . Antonio 's uncle Juan brought us local white wine , slices of the air-dried ham for which the Alpujarras is renowned , and a bowl of pears . " Our terraces are small , the soil grudging , the season short , " Antonio said . " Most of the men leave the Alpujarras to make their fortunes . I spent seven years in the orange groves of Valencia . " But I am back now to stay . Life is too hectic , too crowded on the plains . This is home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on another world , lying only a dozen crow-flight miles away . An hour of hairpin turns dropped me from an eagle 's nest ? alpine , traditional , and poor ? to the Mediterranean ? tropical , cosmopolitan , and booming . If the Alpujarras speaks of the past , the Costa del Sol plays the Spain of tomorrow . At his office at the Costa del Sol Tourist Board , promotion manager Diego Franco said , " Historically , our two greatest enemies were the sun and the sea .
