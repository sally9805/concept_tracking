A REPORTER AT LARGE HOMECOMING II  --  A POSTING 10 TIENTSIN MY father grew up on a small farm in Red Creek , New York , not far from the east  --  ern end of Lake On  --  tario . He and his brothers worked hard on the farm from an early age , most years going to the little lo  --  cal district school only in the winter . They had a Methodist up  --  bringing . By prodigies of application , and in spite of a prolonged setback from osteomy  --  elitis in his left arm , my father managed somehow to get up the Latin and Greek needed to enter Syracuse Uni  --  versity . There , after having to drop out for two years to earn enough mon  --  ey to continue , he became a success : he played baseball , was pledged to Psi Upsilon , and rose to the presidency of what was then one of the most presti  --  gious organizations on campus , the Y.M.C.A. He fell in love with the brown-eyed beauty who was president of the Y.V.C.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mis  --  sionary fervor of the first years of the century . My father actually did become one . He was recruited by the International Committee of the Y.M.C.A. , and in 1905 , fresh out of college , he was posted  --  for the rest of his life , he believed  --  to a city called Tientsin , in North China . A year later , the brown-eyed beauty packed a wedding dress in a trunk and travelled to the opposite side of the earth to join him . Among other events in the lives of the young couple were the births in home bed  --  rooms , two , four , and eight years later , of three sons . I was the third . Never very " muscular , " as model male evangelists in the China field were often said to he , my father was a gentle , kindly , bookish , unpressing person , still and always a hard worker . My mother , besides being good-look  --  ing , was quietly strong and serene . She and my father teamed well together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively , harmonious home ; I never heard a single angry word spoken be  --  tween them . Knowing next to nothing about China and the Chinese when they set out , they came to love the country and the people . They probably did not clearly real  --  ize themselves that they were part of a second wave of the Protestant mission  --  ary movement to reach China . The first wave , which had gone out in the nineteenth century , had consisted al  --  most entirely of pure evangelists , bent on saving souls . They had preached in the streets ; they had given away poorly translated Bibles , the pages of which often wound up padding the soles of Chinese cloth shoes . Many of those pioneers were powerful personalities , great eccentrics  --  frequently learned , sometimes fanatic , a few of them mad . All were certainly brave  --  as , indeed , were those in the second wave , which began arriving as the twentieth cen ? tury opened . Those in the second wave even  --  tually called them  --  selves Social-Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of life of the people they served as they were in converting them . They brought medi  --  cine , education , sci  --  ence , agronomy , con  --  servation , and ideas for social planning . My father devoted twenty years to the Chinese people , and in the end gave his health and his life to China . After a trip on a mule cart into famine country , he came down with encephalitis , which was to have a sequel of Parkinson 's disease , and he had to retire to the United States in 1925 , taking his wife and children with him . Years passed , and I became an un  --  believer . I returned to Tientsin as a journalist twice , in 1939 and 1946 ; the second visit was three years before the Communists took power . Recently , I went back again to Tientsin . Since my last trip there , history had churned things up fairly thoroughly , and mis  --  sionaries had been given a rather bad name in its books . For a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and many Americans regarded them as , at best , " cultural imperialists . " One of the things I was most interested in during this visit , naturally , was whether my parents ' lives had been worth living . I was fortunate that in my effort to find derivatives of their lives I had the help of a Chinese friend named Ye Dezhuang , whom I had met in Peking during my 1946 visit . Lao Ye  --  Old Ye , as I had come to call him  --  had become a distinguished research pro  --  fessor at the Chinese Academy of Ag  --  ricultural Sciences in Peking , and he had spent much of his life translating the complete works of Charles Darwin into Chinese . He was a native of Tientsin , a member of a once promi  --  nent family there , and in inviting him to join me during my visit I hoped he might be able to trace some old friends of my parents ' . He did get permission from the authorities to join me , and when I saw him after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see descendants of two of my father 's best friends , Zhang Boling and Wang Zhiping . Zhang had been a great educator , founder of what was now one of China 's foremost universi  --  ties , Nankai . Wang had been a close colleague of my father 's in Y.M.C.A. work and had later become Methodist Bishop of Tientsin . I had been in Tientsin a few days before Ye was able to get there . Fi  --  nally , I went to meet him at the Tien  --  tsin railroad station . He had brought with him a niece of his , named Li Lai  --  lai , who was on the staff of an En  --  glish-language magazine published in Peking , Cltnet Reconstructs . As soon as we met , Lao Ye said , " We 've been lucky . I think we 've learned about some old friends of your family . " I took them to where they were going to stay . Ye said he wanted the rest of the day and the evening to scout around for me . THE next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hotel . Ye gave me news that astonished me  --  that the Y.M.C.A. was back in business in Tientsin . We were to go right then to its temporary office and meet the Tientsin General Sec  --  retary . We took a cab to 12 Guangxi Road , deep in the former Extra-Mural Ex  --  tension of the British Con  --  cession , which had not been built up in my boyhood but now looked as congested and run-down as some of the oldest parts of the city . We got out in front of a tiny white building with a tiny church spire . A sturdy gentleman dressed in a blue Mao jacket greeted us . " Welcome , " he said , in well-pronounced English . " I 'm Harry P. Yang . " He led us into a small office off a brightly painted ground-floor corridor . The Y , Mr. Yang said , had been reopened six months before . It shared this building with the Y.W.C.A. and another Christian organization , which called itself the Three-Self Patriotic Move  --  ment . The last had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native Christian group , altogether indepen  --  dent of the Western missionary en  --  terprise ; because it was purely Chinese , it was recognized by the Communist government . Its three " selfs " could be roughly translated as self-adminis  --  tration , self-support , and self-propaga  --  tion of the Gospel  --  each " self " really meaning without foreign help . As for the Y.M.C.A. , one of the good things my father and other secre  --  taries had very early done , as many other missionary organizations had not , was to turn over control of the organization to Chinese ; and since it had therefore become an essentially Chinese enterprise , the government had allowed it to continue its work after the revolution . The Y had been shut down , like every other religious organization , during the ten years of the Cultural Revolution . Mr. Yang said he had two men working with him now as Association Secretaries . " We are old men , " he said . He was over seventy , and the others were over sixty . Mr. Yang was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had graduated from Yenching , the famous church-sup ? ported university in Peking , in 1933 , and the next year he had become boys ' secretary of the Tientsin Y.M.C.A. , in its main building on East Horse Road , which I had often visited as a child . Nine years later , he had taken over as General Secretary . The build  --  ing we were now in had been a Chi  --  nese chapel , founded before the revo  --  lution by a Tientsin businessman , Frank Yung Tao ; Mr. Yang had taken it over as a Y branch in the forties . Mr. Yang said that after the Second World War the World Youth Fund of the International Y.M.C.A. had sent him to the United States , and he had studied social work at Colum  --  bia . After Liberation  --  this Christian used the term as naturally as everyone else did  --  he had carried on in the East Horse Road building for a decade . The program dwindled , and he " went into another line . " The building on East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the Cultural Revolution , Mr. Yang had been made to work as a packer in an electrical-apparatus factory . The three children of this bureaucrat of Christianity had turned out to he just as privileged as the offspring of most upper-level Communist cadres , for they were members of China 's edu  --  cated elite : a daughter , a graduate of Peking University ( formerly Yen  --  ching , Mr. Yang 's alma mater ) , was the director of a kindergarten ; a son , a graduate of Peking 's other big univer  --  sity , Qinghua , was a radio engineer ; and a second son , another Peking University graduate , was a specialist in satellite communication . I asked Mr. Yang how the reopened Y.114.C.A. supported itself . " By donations from individuals and by rents . " Rents ? Certainly . The government , Mr. Yang said , had honored the Y 's title to the big building on East Horse Road , and there were other properties . " We had to sell the house you lived in , on Recreation Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " They were origi  --  nally owned by the International Committee . It sold them to us . Later , we had to let them go ; one of them belongs to a kindergarten now . " Noticing that Mr. Yang 's desk had no papers on it , I asked what the Association 's activities were . So far , he said , the work had been largely prepa  --  ratory . They were getting ready to re  --  sume educational work  --  classes , to be  --  gin with , in accounting , bookkeeping , electrical repairs . The main problem was that they had no classrooms ; they were negotiating with nearby primary schools to borrow rooms after hours . They had started " boys ' work " with about twenty youngsters , some of whom had joined the Wesley Church choir . A church was open ? " Oh , yes ! The Wesley Church , in the former French Concession . We have five to six hundred in our con  --  gregation every Sunday . You should come . Any denomination : Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . A great number of young people are joining . We 've had two mass baptisms  --  over one hundred and twenty new members last year , and at least a third of them young people . " I asked if no one was surprised that a Marxist government allowed the Christian religion ? " opium of the people " ? such license . " Not at all surprising , " Mr. Yang said . " Except during the Cultural Revolution , the People 's Republic has always had a free policy toward reli  --  religion . The Constitution says that the people are free to believe or not believe in religion , and especially . ' since the fall of the Gang of Four the government has honored that provision . " And , besides , my friends pointed out after we left , had n't I noticed what the activities were going to be ? Classes in accounting , bookkeeping , electrical repairs . A pragmatic Communist gov  --  ernment could well afford not mere  --  ly to tolerate but even to encourage religious organizations if they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the total wipeout it had suffered during the ten years of the Cultural Revolu  --  tion . THE next day , Ye and his niece came for me after lunch . There were to be new surprises . We took a taxi to a small house in a back alley . A stocky ' man was waiting for us , with close-cropped white hair and with eyes narrowed between puffy places both above and below them , so that he looked oddly shrewd and a bit mischie  --  vous . He wore a well-cut dark-blue Mao jacket . His name was Li You  --  zhen . He was eighty years old . We sat in a dim room containing a simple low table , some straight chairs , md , against the far wall , a bed  --  a reminder of the crowdedness in China , where no room in a home can serve a single purpose . A young man brought a teapot and some covered cups from another room . " I got permission from your father to work at the Y.M.C.A. , " Mr. Li said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , training youn  --  ger boys to play soccer , basketball , and tennis . I was directly under Dr. Siler , but your father was the General Secre  --  tary , and he hired me . He told me , You be a good boy and work hard , and help you . I 'll give you a chance to study physical education at one of the Christian universities . ' That made me happy , because I wanted to study sports . When I had been there five years , I said to your father , ' I 've been here five years . I think I 've been a good boy . When are you going to give me the chance you spoke of ? ' He said , Work hard and be pa  --  tient . ' I said , ' But when will I go ? ' He said , ' They have good courses in physical education at Suzhou University . You wait and work hard , and you 'll get to go . " Mr. Li laughed and looked at me teasingly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat under the good humor . " I heard of a job teaching sports at a school in Shandong , where they would pay fifty Chinese dollars a month , instead of the thirty dollars your father was paying me , so I quit and went there , " he continued . " Four months later , your father 's best friend at the Y , Wang Zhiping , asked me to return to Tientsin , and I did . Your father had left for the United States , and he never came back . I worked with Lockley , with Kingman , with A. G. Robinson . When I was twenty-seven , Lockley gave me my chance to go to Suzhou for two years . And in 1936 I went with the Chinese delegation to the Olym  --  pics in Berlin . I saw Hitler . And then I went to the United States and stud  --  ied in Springfield , Massachusetts , for two years on a scholarship , and fi  --  nally I became a Bachelor of Physical Education . I truly had got my chance , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too young to understand what your father meant . I was young , and I was angry . Later , I went to Lockley , and I said , ' I did n't live up to what Hersey asked me to do . I was not patient . It was really my fault . I was too young to he patient . ' When  --  ever I think about it , I tell myself I was too hasty . Today , I am talking with you . You have come to see me . I am happy I have this chance to con  --  fess . Really , your father helped me a lot . I say that from the bottom of my heart . " Nevertheless , it seemed to me there was still a lot of rancor under the courteous apology . So , sensing a need for an act of barter , I made a for  --  mal apology to him for my father 's fail  --  ure to help him as soon as he would have liked . After that , we were quits , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked mostly about one gift that my father 's Y.M.C.A. had indu  --  bitably given to China . With the help of men like Mr. Li , it had introduced - Western sports , a number of which have by now become sources of intense nationalistic pride in Chinese life ; one of them , Ping-Pong , helped restore relations between the United States and China . Quite a few of the Y.M.C.A. secretaries who went out in that second wave of missionaries had been great athletes in college  --  men like six-foot-six , two-hundred-pound Robert R. ( Center Rush ) Gailey , of the Princeton football team , and C. H. Robertson , who had been captain of football , track , and baseball at Purdue . Beginning in about 1905 , Robertson over and over again put three ques  --  tions to the Chinese : When will China send its first athlete to the Olympic Games ? When will China send its first team to the Olympic Games ? When will China first be host to the Olympic Games ? In those days , his questions seemed awfully quirky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kite flying , and ritual swordplay . In time , of course , the questions made sense . My father 's sport , baseball , never caught on in China as it did in Japan . ( Many Japanese have seemed to want to he as much like Americans as possible ; the Chinese have shunned that kind of mimicry . ) But the New China has certainly gone mad over the " big-hall " sports that the Y originally brought to the country  --  volleyball , basketball , and soccer . MIRACULOUSLY , Lao Ye had found for me more than a trace of Father 's close friend Bishop Wang . Our next call was on one of his sons  --  Wang Benyuan , a man in his early seventies . Wang fils , who had at  --  tended Syracuse , spoke idiomatic American English . He and I remembered each other , both from the twen  --  ties and because I had looked him up during my later visits . Benyuan lived with a daughter and son-in-law in three rooms  --  one-half of the house that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lailai , and me on three sides of a square table on which cakes and cook  --  ies for a Western-style tea party had been laid out ; he saved for himself an old round-hacked armchair of split cane . He paid my parents extravagant compliments , and he reminded me that during my 1946 visit we had gone together to the funeral of a member of his family , and he had lent me a black Western necktie for the occasion . What gradually emerged as we talked was a picture of a decent , kind  --  hearted man who had become a casu  --  alty of the ignominies and harsh phys  --  ical punishments of the Cultural Rev  --  olution . " That great catastrophe , " he called it , and he repeated , with bitter emphasis , " Catastrophe ! " He had been put to feeding pigs . Ile had developed emphysema and , later , heart trouble . His wife had recently died . " I ca n't go out of the house , " he said . " I sit here in her chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . " After the 1976 earthquake , a squatter had occupied the other half of his house , and much of his life now was taken up with wearisome efforts to dislodge the in  --  terloper . Both Ye , who had undergone far greater hardships than he but had somehow come through sound , and . especially Lailai , whose father had died of heart trouble after his ordeals in the Cultural Revolution , tried to reassure him . The government would see to it that he got hack all of his own house . It had been honoring equities such as his , they said . I mentioned what Harry Yang had told us about young people going to church in such numbers , and I asked Benyuan if he could account for it . He said he thought that three kinds of young people were taking up Chris  --  tianity . First , there were the children of Christians . Second , there were some who were just curious . But much the largest number , he thought , were from among older young people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were now seeking some kind of spiritual fulfill  --  ment . We talked for some time about our fathers . Benyuan recalled that the logo of the Y.M.C.A. was a red triangle , the three corners of which stood for Mind , Body- , Spirit . The work the two men had done together had been an attempt to encompass all three in vari  --  ous educational and civic projects . Al  --  though there was undeniably a certain amount of religious cant in their ex  --  pressions of the work , much of what they did had practical aims remarkably like those of some of the morale-build  --  ing undertakings of the Deng Xiao  --  ping leadership . In 1919 , my father wrote a pamphlet , " Social Service , " which , if some brief inspirational passages were cut out , might serve as a manual for any of Tientsin 's Neigh  --  borhood Committees in their dealings with the day-to-day life of the young in the city . Many of the social-work devices my father and other Y.M.C.A. secretaries invented ( such as street pa  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many of their cam  --  paigns ( such as " Kill flies ! They cause cholera ! " ) were much later taken up on a large scale by the Communists . Benyuan had obviously been moved by Ye 's and Lailai 's sympathy about the squatter in his house , and he seemed undone by the memories my visit stirred up . He began talking about giving us all a banquet in a good Tientsin restaurant . Since he was not supposed to leave the house at all , this was obviously out of the question , and I promised instead to come and see him again before I left Tientsin . De  --  spite the prohibition against his going outdoors , he followed the Chinese cus  --  tom of walking " to the courtyard gate " with his departing guest  --  in this case , to the taxi waiting in the main street at the end of an alleyway . I was touched by this risky gesture by an old friend . His talk of a banquet made me think of sumptuous meals when I was a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered the delicious meat of the smoked litchi nuts Ben ? yuan 's father used to press on me , the smallest boy at the crowded table . AFTER dinner that evening , I was treated , thanks to Lao Ye , to a connection with my father 's other closest friend , Zhang Boling . My fa  --  ther 's first job when he arrived at Tientsin in 1905 , fresh out of Syra  --  cuse University and unable to speak a word of Chinese , included teaching English at a middle school that had recently been founded by Zhang ; my mother later taught at the same school . Father was eventually to he one of a group of Y.M.C.A. secretaries who persuaded Zhang to become a Chris  --  tian . Zhang later became chairman of the Tientsin Y.M.C.A. board of di  --  rectors . In 1919 , he expanded his mid  --  dle school into Nankai University , which has since become one of the four or five most important centers of learning in China . In my childhood , Dr. Zhang had been held up to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re  --  membered his tall , massive figure , his dark bandit mustaches , his piercing eyes . Senior to my father , he had died in 1951 , but now Ye had found  --  and that evening Lailai led me to  --  a daughter-in-law of his , named Zhu Angui , and a handsome grandson , Zhang Yuanlong , and Yuanlong 's wife and three-year-old child , the pa  --  triarch 's great-grandson . The family lived in two rooms on the fourth floor of a row house at the end of a long , dark alley . We sat talking in a bed  --  room-living room-dining room . For the dead , as for the living , they told me , the Cultural Revolution had been a period of trial . Dr. Zhang had been criticized posthumously as a product of " feudalism " and a tool of imperialism . But after 1976 his name was not only cleared but honored . When the cemetery in which he had been buried was taken over as a factory site , his body was dug up and cre  --  mated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Cemetery . His portrait , Yuanlong said , now hung in the Tientsin His  --  torical Museum . We talked about how Zhang Boling had guided my father and others in the Y.114.C.A in their devising of educa  --  tional projects . Here the Y 's record was undeniably useful to China , for its emphasis was on practical and voca  --  tional education . It also gave early support to a remarkable mass literacy program , devised by a young Christian named James Y. C. Yen . Yen and my father had been roommates in France during the First World War , when both were Y.M.C.A. workers trying to ease the terrible life of two hundred thousand Chinese coolies who had been shipped to France to dig trenches and unload ships . There have been reports that the young Mao Zedong was one of the teachers in a literacy campaign of Yen 's in Mao 's Hunan Province ; the Communists took up Yen 's methods in a big way later on . When I was about to leave , Yuan-long called his small son in from the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the child that my father had been a friend of his great-grandfather . I suppose some  --  thing vaguely having to do with an  --  cestors may have stirred in the child 's mind , for he at once came boldly for  --  ward , took my hand , and kissed it . YE and Lailai came a few days later to take me out to East Horse Road , to see the old Y.M.C.A. build  --  ing , now called the Tientsin Chil  --  dren 's Palace . My father had helped get this substantial edifice built , in the early teens of the century , and 1 was eager to see it again , for I had many associations with the building . We went most of the way by bus . The buses were fiercely crowded , and they had been designed for passengers somewhat shorter than I. 1 found that if I could force my way to the center of the bus I could put my head up into a trapdoor ventilator there and stand up straight . While I was propped up there , Ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not be carried away by the sentimentality of seeing old friends of my parents . As a friend of mine , he was glad to arrange these meetings , but I must remember that many missionaries had been most harmful to China . Some had supported Chiang Kai-shek to the very end . Some , to his knowledge , had actually been venal and corrupt . Some had spied for Chiang and had caused many deaths . A few minutes later , the bus knocked over a cyclist . I knew that it took months , and sometimes years , to save enough to buy a bicycle , and 1 asked what would happen after this accident . Ye said there would be an investigation , and if it was found that it was the driver 's fault the bicycle would be repaired or replaced . We had to walk some distance from the bus stop nearest the building . I saw it ahead : four stories , red brick , white stone quoins around the windows . Once a month , my brothers and I used to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our par ? ents would hire a car  --  riage for us from Tat  --  tersall 's stables , on Racecourse Road . At the Y , we would first have a haircut in the barbershop in the base  --  ment , then we would each be allowed to buy a pack of chewing gum , then we would go upstairs to the audi  --  torium to watch a movie : Charlie Chap  --  lin , " The Perils of Pauline , " and once , I recall , a version of " Little Lord Faunt  --  leroy " in which Mary Pickford played both the little boy and his mother , and in one scene kissed herself on the cheek . One after  --  noon , in the auditori  --  um , at an entertain  --  ment for Chinese Christians , I joined my friend and neighbor Bobby Long  --  who be  --  came , many years later , the president of Lyndon State College , in Vermont  --  in a vocal duet , accompanied by piano . V4re were six or seven years old . Half  --  way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . The audience roared with laughter , and we had no choice but to decide that we were charming . Now , on the sidewalk in front of the main entrance , some students were selling tickets to a movie they said was being shown upstairs . The barbershop was still going strong . We stepped down to it through its street door . When the head barber learned that I had had my hair cut in this shop half a century ago , he at once offered to cut my hair free . But I was eager to go upstairs . There everything was vividly familiar . My father 's office , there , in the corner . The reading room , there , still a reading room . Then up to the gym : a dancing class for little girls was going on , and up on the wooden track that formed an oval balcony on the high walls a squad of them was going round and round in a formal slow-motion pace , arms slowly rising and falling in motions of flying . The film being shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese movie idol named Li Moran . This auditorium was the heart of the building . It had not been just a place for entertainment . Here the Y.B.I.C.A. had made some of its most significant contributions : vivid demon  --  strations of physical laws of the universe , of radiotelegraphy , of the principles of heavier-than-air flight ; lectures on typhus , cholera , tuberculo  --  sis , and plague ; explanations of the consequences of deforestation ; introduc  --  tions to the latest theories on manures and on seed strains ; speeches on meth  --  ods of river conservation and flood control ; outlining of plans for rational famine relief ; and many other offer  --  ings of ideas , new then , for China 's advancement . The Chinese themselves have begun to revise somewhat the scattershot charge against all mission  --  aries that they were cultural impe  --  rialists . The practical-minded Deng Xiaoping government has been trying desperately to catch up on many of the very things about which the Y.M.C.A. and other missionary educational insti  --  tutions first spread the word . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other old structures in Tientsin , was in rotten condition . ANOTHER day , we went to the Tientsin Historical Museum . I was curious to see how the missionary movement would be treated there . The museum 's huge halls were crowded  --  mostly with schoolchildren . Photo  --  graphic displays and explanatory texts were mounted on the walls . As we went the rounds , we saw that " feudal  --  ism " and imperialism took their prop  --  er lumps , of course . But here , sure enough , was a heroic photograph of my father 's Christian friend Zhang Boling , the founder of Nankai Uni  --  versity . And here was a huge photo  --  graph of the Y.M.C.A. building . Lai  --  lai translated for me the text alongside it , which stated that the Y.M.C.A. had invited Li Dazhao , one of the founders of the Communist Party , to speak in this building . Li had later had to take refuge in the Soviet Embassy , but the warlord Zhang Zuolin had sent goons into the Embassy and killed him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years of work my father and mother , and many men and women like them , had done for a China they loved very much ; but at least something was there . On the other side of the room , there was a quite different display  --  not in photographs but in exultantly cruel drawings . They depicted what came to be called , by the foreigners in the city , the Tientsin Massacre of 1870 . This was an event that must always have hovered , ever afterward , like a vague memory of a nightmare which might recur in the minds of all Tientsin missionaries  --  including , no doubt , my peaceable parents . Looking at these hideously proud reminders of it , and recalling all the stabbings , tortures , beatings , and Peking-opera sword-fights I had been exposed to on Chi  --  nese television , and remembering the accounts I had heard in recent days of what Red Guards had done to the innocent and good-hearted old men . I had been talking with , I was obliged to think about a ferocity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightheartedness , and deli  --  cate sensitivity to the feelings of others shown by the Chinese people . One could easily parse out , as this museum certainly did , a Marxist interpretation of that ferocity , and if there was a Christian God he must surely have known what kind of rage the Chinese common people had built up over the centuries against foreigners and land  --  lords and compradors and mission aries . But I was left , before that dis  --  play , with puzzling and still queasy thoughts of an afternoon in my child  --  hood when I heard from a friend about huge crowds that had gathered at the execution ground to watch three Chinese men have their heads cut off . The three were called " criminals ; " they were quite likely young leftists . All afternoon of the day I heard about those crowds , I stayed in my room , in our house , alone . A early as the eighteenth century , the Chinese hatred of mission  --  aries ( up to that time Catholic ) had begun to express itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much money , wrote that when a Chinese convert was about to die a Catholic priest covered the convert 's head with a piece of cloth and , pre  --  tending to pronounce absolution , stole the dying man 's eyes ; he then mixed these with lead and mercury in an alchemical process and produced sil  --  ver . After the " unequal treaties " of 1858 and 1860 , diatribes against the missionaries grew more and more vir  --  ulent . One document , " Death Blow to Corrupt Doctrines , " charged that at a Christian service the pastor takes a seat at the front of the congregation and praises the virtues of Jesus , and then " the whole group mumbles through the liturgies , after which they copulate together in order to consum  --  mate their joy . " A bride must spend the night before her wedding with the pastor . The reason barbarians stink is that they believe God 's most precious gift to mankind is the female menstru  --  al flow , so when a woman 's period comes they vie with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Tientsin , after 1860 , the French in particular offended Chinese feel  --  ings . They seized an imperial palace near the river and made it their con  --  sulate , and they tore down a temple next to it and built a Catholic cathe  --  dral on the site . To compound these insults , the Lazarist Sisters of St. Vin  --  cent de Paul established an orphanage , and in their eagerness to win souls for Christ they offered a cash premium for each child brought in to them ; and , what was worse , they were said to have paid to have sick and dying chil  --  dren carried to them , so they could baptize them in articulo mortis . In 1870 , rumors were circulated that af  --  ter conducting their mystic rites the nuns extracted the babies ' eyes and hearts for purposes of witchery . Four men were arrested , charged with hav  --  ing kidnapped children and sold them to the orphanage ; the men 's heads were cut off . On June 18th , another man was arrested , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  rangement with the Chinese verger of the cathedral for the latter to buy the children he stole . The city went wild . Violence was touched off by the intem  --  perate and overbearing behavior of the French consul , who in a rage smashed teacups and other things in the office of the imperial commissioner and then fired a pistol into a crowd outside . He was immediately killed by the mob and torn to pieces . Within three hours , the crowd had plundered and destroyed the orphanage , had set the cathedral on fire , and had burned down the French consulate . The mob brutally killed , besides the consul , an aide of his ; an attache of the French legation in Peking and his bride , both of whom had just arrived from France ; two priests ; ten nuns ; and thirty-odd Chi  --  nese associated with the Catholics . They also killed a Russian merchant ? a Mr. Protopopoff  --  and his wife , also recently married , who just hap  --  pened to be riding horseback through the area where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked , one by one , and in full sight of the surviving nuns ripped their bodies open , cut their breasts off , gouged their eyes out , and , finally , impaled them on long spears , hoisted them in the air , and threw them into the burn  --  ing chapel of the orphanage . No other foreigners were killed , but four En  --  glish and American churches were plundered and damaged . ON the next Sunday morning , I attended part of a church service . This was the first time in decades I had gone to church . I went out of curiosity ; Ye and Lailai went out of courtesy to me . We arrived three-quarters of an hour late , on the as  --  sumption that the sermon would by then be over , or nearly so . I especially wanted to hear a Chinese congrega  --  tion sing a hymn . The Wesley Church , in Tientsin 's old French Concession , could not be recognized from the street as a place of worship . There was no spire , no cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered a stunningly beautiful oc  --  tagonal hall , flooded with sunlight through large windows , the walls wainscotted and trimmed with dark-stained wood  --  the only jarring note a neon cross above the altar . The build  --  ing had been perfectly maintained . A congregation of more than five hun  --  dred was ranged in the pews . Lailai , who was especially interested in the phenomenon of young people 's taking up religion , did a little counting and estimated that at least forty per cent of the worshippers were under thirty . Some vigorous preaching was being hurled at the audience by Sun Jing  --  shin , the president of the Chinese In  --  stitute of Theology . He was a short man with a shaved head , and wore a blue Mao jacket . We three had seri  --  ously underestimated the lung power of Chinese divines . A parishioner near us whispered that the Reverend Mr. Sun had been at it for about half an hour and gave us the hopeful estimate that he would be done in about twenty minutes more . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was preaching on a text that to me seemed odd for a discourse to a Chi  --  nese Christian flock : the entirety of Chapter 16 of Deuteronomy , which contains detailed instructions for the celebration of the Passover . Ye later said indignantly , " He was barking at us ! " Pastor Sun 's style was anecdotal , and most of his message was a rather simple appeal for decent everyday deal  --  ings between people . He told , for ex  --  ample , of a woman who lived next door to her daughter-in-law . The lat  --  ter 's hens regularly produced eight eggs in the former 's yard . Usually , the mother-in-law delivered all the eggs to the daughter-in-law , but one day she was too sorely tempted and ate one . Then she dared not return the re  --  maining seven . She went to the minis  --  ter and said she had committed a crime . What crime ? It was too big to tell . God forgives , the minister said  --  tell it . She did . The minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven eggs , confess to her daughter-in-law , and pray . She obeyed , and the Holy Ghost filled her body . The next morning , all her neighbors noticed that she was indeed filled with the Holy Ghost . We sat in the back , near an alms box , into which a poorly dressed late  --  comer stuffed a ten-yuan note  --  hard  --  won savings of a month or two . ( Lai  --  lai was shocked , she told me later . ) I saw clear signs that I was not the only restless person in the church . More and more worshippers found they had to go to the bathroom , which was situated off to our right in the rear . Finally , the sermon was over . At the end of a prayer , the choir , who were dressed in black robes with white shoulder capes and occupied a stall to the right of the altar , sang a superb baroque amen . And at long last we were treated to a hymn . The singing was loud and enthusiastic , a Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whiter than snow , yes , whiter than snow ; Now wash me , and I shall be whiter than snow . YE took me out Racecourse Road to call on an eighty-four-year-old man named Zhang Shucheng . He was living in a spacious but sparsely fur  --  nished pair of rooms while his own apartment , nearby , was being reno  --  vated . As soon as Mr. Zhang saw me , he said , in Chinese , " You are taller than your father was . Your face is thinner . He had a mustache . " Mr. Zhang had dined in our house , he said , and he remembered me as the baby of the family . " You had two older broth  --  ers ; there were no daughters . " Mr. Zhang was a short man with a still powerful frame . He had close-cropped white hair and wore tortoise ? shell spectacles . He looked at least twenty years younger than he was , and his mind was zesty and swift . He asked my age . He said he had started going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never became a Chris  --  tian . At the Y , he studied Chinese boxing , did gymnastics , and played basketball . " Because I learned there how to take care of myself , I have been healthy all my life . I learned to keep exercising . I used to do figure skating on the rink in the Recreation Ground and on the big lake in the Russian Park . They taught me at the Y.M.C.A. to take cold baths every day in winter . " I recalled to Mr. Zhang that Ber  --  trand Russell , after a series of lectures in China in 1920 , had been very scornful of the Y.M.C.A. for its belief in the " mystic efficacy ' of cold baths and dumb-bells . " " Nonsense ! Look at me ! I 've never caught a cold in my life . " Then he told me his remarkable story . He went to work for the Zhong Xing Coal Mining Company in Shandong Province and eventually be  --  came its director . In 1937 , when the Japanese invaded North China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following an ancient Chinese tradition that when a man could not honorably continue in a position of power he should retire to his study , Mr. Zhang quit , took up the art of calligraphy , and began collecting ancient paintings and jade . He became a close friend of the son of the northern warlord Zhang Zuolin , Zhang Xueliang , who kid  --  napped Chiang Kai-shek in 1936 in order to persuade him to deal with the Communists . Chiang did for a while , but not for long . After the Commu  --  nists defeated Chiang , Mr. Zhang continued to live in retirement , study  --  ing calligraphy and painting . He be  --  gan writing a novel about a collector of ancient artifacts . Because he was " a clean man , " having resisted the Japa  --  nese , the government paid interest on the properties it had taken from him , and the mine , which had been nation  --  alized , also paid him a pension , and even , he said , allowed him " horse  --  and-carriage money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ; under socialism , he remained , relatively speaking , a rich man . One of the slogans of the Cultural Revolution was : " Drive Out the ' Four Olds ' " : old habits , old ideas , old cus  --  toms , and the old culture . Red Guards singled out Mr. Zhang as one who stood for all four . They put him in a cellar , beat him , and made him work as a bricklayer . He said he trained himself to lift first one brick , then two , then three , then four . He kept himself sane by reciting Tang Dynasty poems to himself : Beside my bed the bright moon  --  beams play Almost as if there were frost on the ground , Raising my head , l gaze at the mountain moon ; Lying back , 1 think of my old home town . A scholarly correspondence about ancient paintings with his brother-in-law , the manuscript of his novel , and the paintings he himself had done  --  as well as some photographs he had of the Y.M.C.A. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olds ' turned into Drive Out the Gang of Four , ' " Mr. Zhang cheerfully said He was rehabilitated . He gave his surviving art treasures to the state , and Zhou Enlai praised him as " a patriotic capi  --  talist . " One criticism of the Y.M.C.A. in my father 's day was that it catered to the rich and the powerful , to the literati and businessmen from whom it raised money ; but here was a turn  --  around  --  the Communists praising my father 's rich friend as a patriot . He now made me a present of a small scroll on which was printed a reproduction of the most famous paint  --  ing he had given his country  --  a Song-dynasty landscape , five centuries older than Leonardo 's " Last Supper . " It was called " Snow Scene , Winter Forest , " and was attributed to the fa  --  mous eleventh-century artist Fan Kuan . ( I later saw the original , in a show of Mr. Zhang 's gifts to the state which was held in the Forbidden City in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five wide , of a looming for  --  ested mountain , in sepia and black and white . ) Mr. Zhang told me that only two of Fan Kuan 's paintings still ex  --  isted ; the other was on Taiwan . An  --  other treasure in his collection was " In the Peach Fairyland , " by the sixteenth-century painter Qiu Ying , one of the four great masters of the Ming dynasty . He had also donated , among other things , a praying mantis carved from yellow jade in the Shang dynasty ( about the nineteenth to elev  --  enth century B.C. ) , and a cicada in white jade from the Western Zhou dy  --  nasty ( eleventh to eighth century B.C. ) . IF took me far out into the eastern suburbs of the city to see another elderly man who had known my fa  --  ther . We drove in a taxi for more than half an hour  --  I could imagine how long it would take to commute by bicycle , or by crowded bus , from these far reaches -- and came to an area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes of living space . ? Ve climbed to the fourth floor of one of these interchangeable boxes , to an apartment of two rather bare rooms , with concrete walls and floors . Here lived Li Qingan , once a member of a famous Y.M.C.A. bas  --  ketball team , now a member of the faculty of the Tientsin Athletic Insti  --  tute . He greeted me with warm remi  --  niscences of my father . Mr. Li was born in the countryside nearly eighty years before , one of ten children of a poor man . An American Board missionary named Chandler had baptized him as a boy , and he had thus become what some missionaries called " a rice Christian " ? one , that is , whose family , if not he himself , had seen in conversion to the faith some distinct material advantages , not the least of which was a free education in mission elementary and middle schools and a mission college . He joined the Tientsin Y.M.C.A. and , in 1923 , started playing as center on the all-Chinese Y basketball team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because in the symbolic warfare on the gym boards China could win avenging battles against the great powers ; for example , the team often trounced the five from the United States 15th In  --  fantry . During his many years on the team , Mr. Li supported himself as a clerk in the United States consulate . Much later , during the Cultural Revolution , that job proved to have been a taint , and Mr. Li had a painful time , and now he had heart disease . After his " clarification , " he worked with the Tientsin Athletic Commission , and later with the Institute . He had got this apparently desirable apartment , for which the rent was the equivalent of only three and a half American dollars a month , by what the Chinese call hou men  --  a " back-door " ar rangement which he had been able to make because he was a member of the Tientsin People 's Political Con  --  sultative Conference . But now he wanted to move hack into the city , and would have to resort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill ; the four-story climb was had for his heart ; and the long bus ride to work was dangerous for him . In the room with us while we talked was a son of Mr. Li 's , a champion swimmer , who was a coach in Shang  --  hai . Under a compassionate govern  --  ment policy , he had been excused From work , with pay , to be at home for an in  --  definite time on account of his moth  --  er 's illness . N.Ve got talking about young people going to Christian churches . The swimmer corroborated the three reasons Wang Benyuan had given for this phenomenon and added a fourth : the fashion of things Western among young Chinese . He said a great many young Chinese were eager these days to go to the United States . Some thought they wanted to stay , but he thought they would all come back as the years passed , because they would see that close family ties and respect for old age make life for the elderly much better in China than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li , deprecating his heart trouble and ignoring protests by both Ye and me , insisted on seeing the son of an old friend to the gate  --  going all the way down four flights of stairs , which he would then have to climb hack up . I was touched once more by this sacrificial courtesy , and was struck by the power of the Four Olds , which the decade of the Cultural Revolution had obviously failed to wipe out . Even the younger genera  --  tion 's Westernizing fad that young Mr. Li had talked about seemed col  --  ored by them , for shortly after we got back to the center of the city I saw a Chinese teen-ager walking along with a stereo tape deck held on his shoulder , music blasting at full volume into his ear . He was playing classical Peking opera . ON my last full day in Tientsin , Li Lailai took me to see another elderly man . This was Huang Yu  --  sheng , who had for many years been dean of Nankai University and was now chief librarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was husky , robust , and clearheaded . The library was housed in grand premises built long ago for the admin  --  istrative offices of the French Conces  --  sion , and Mr. Huang 's office was a spacious room with a high ceiling . He talked in beautiful English for a min  --  ute about the library . It had first used the Dewey decimal system of classifi  --  cation , then had tried the system of the American Library of Congress awhile , but was now using a numerical system of its own . At this point , he turned to me with a smile and said , " Do n't you think your mother taught me well ? " Yes , she had taught him English at Zhang Boling 's Nankai Middle School . He demonstrated how , when he was writ  --  ing an exercise , she would sit in the next seat and correct his mistakes . " For some reason , she was obliged to teach us British pronunciations . Dahnce , ' not dance . " Shedule , ' not schedule . ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate thoughts come to me , even now , in English , because Chinese words are wanting for certain feelings I have . But when it comes to numbers only Chinese will do . " Mr. Zhang then came down a hit from his praise of my mother 's teach  --  ing . " When I got to Beida University after the Middle School , I could read eight pages of Robertson 's ' History of the World ' in an hour . I was cha  --  grined to find that my classmates could read eleven pages in an hour . But "  - -  Mr . Zhang seemed eager to hurry away from an implied slur ? " I have something else to tell you . Your fa  --  ther , you know , taught at the Middle School , too . He played the cornet , and he composed the music for our school song . It was quite suitable . The ca  --  dence was stately , not too quick , And one other thing , too , you may be inter  --  ested to hear . Zhou Enlai was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'm fairly sure your mother taught him also . " What a thought ! I had met Zhou Enlai in 1939 , in a clandestine inter  --  view in Chungking , where he was trying to negotiate a joint Kuomin  --  tang-Communist campaign against the Japanese . I then believed  --  and on this trip I was finding that a great many Chinese now think  --  that he was the most humane and honorable of the tog-ranking Chinese Communists . When we met , he spoke a little En  --  glish but said he could think more clearly in Chinese . Could that En  --  glish , however imperfect , have been taught him by my mother ? I told Mr. Huang how much the idea excited me . " Well , then , " he said , " you must let me lend you the library 's car to go out to the Zhou Enlai Museum . You see , it 's right in the old Nankai Mid  --  dle School building . In fact , they have preserved a classroom exactly as it was when your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go and see it at once . " But no , first he must show me the library , he said , changing his mind . He was immensely proud of the crowds of young people , studying to improve themselves , " filling the tables in the reference room and the reading rooms , at desks in the hall  --  ways , sitting on heatless radiators , and even on the stairs . After our tour , he made the arrangements for the car , and Lailai and I drove out to the museum . WE were greeted by a woman who was the museum 's curator . When she learned what my errand was , she seemed to become almost as excited as I felt . She asked my parents ' Chinese names . I told her my father 's name had been Han Muru ; my mother , so far as I knew , had always been just Han Tai-tai , Mrs. Han . In the front hall , the woman showed us a full-length mirror , in which the stu  --  dents had to examine themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved in wood , were these admonitions : " Face must be clean , hair be brushed , dress be neat , buttons be on . Keep your head up , balance your shoulders , throw out your chest , straighten your back . Do n't be arro  --  gant , do n't be bad-tempered , do n't be remiss in manners . Be friendly , calm , and dignified . " I pictured Zhou Enlai , at sixteen or seventeen , before the mir  --  ror . The curator sent us upstairs with an assistant . Soon I was in the class  --  room , with desks for twenty-eight and a teacher 's desk in front . While I was taking it in , the curator hurried into the room , very pleased at having found my father 's teaching lauded in a his  --  tory of the school ; she had n't found . a Mrs. Han , perhaps because records were n't kept that way anymore . I stood at the front of the room and pictured my mother looking over Zhou 's shoulder , helping him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having any way in the world of knowing that she was teach  --  ing a boy who would one day be a great man . Maybe , by example , she was giving at least a little bit of her remarkable serenity to him . Mr. Huang had fixed 1914 as the year when this scene would have taken place . She was pregnant with me that year . I wanted to believe something of me had been in the classroom , too . ? JOHN HERSEY
