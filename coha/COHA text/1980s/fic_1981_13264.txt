I talked it , I told you . I tried to sell it . Dressed up downtown with the lawyers and the bankers . HAYES And you look good dressed up ? POTTER Good enough . HAYES Sure , why not ?

Do you know what that means ? To him ? To Garretson ? It 's easy . Be practical , that 's all . Look at the budget , look at the balance sheet , look at the box office . Grow up .

And he firmly believes he can ride to the rescue . He still thinks that 's possible . He 's like the miner in my strike film . The Mounties stop the demonstration on Dominion Day . And they have guns , the strikers have sticks . The hero steps out of the crowd . There 's a fire engine out there , in case they need the hoses . He climbs up on it . He tears open his shirt . He yells " Shoot me ! Shoot me if you dare . " HAYES So they shot him . p. 59 POTTER HAYES That 's a stupid gesture . POTTER That 's how Matt lives . Do you know what Matt did for you ? HAYES Please . Do n't ask . POTTER You know what Matt 's like . You know how he gets what he wants .

He loves her but that does n't seem to make any difference . . . HAYES Of course it does n't make a difference . POTTER He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , losing his wife . He 's on the telephone . . . the only time they talk is on the telephone . And he does n't know what to say , he ca n't talk to her . . . He says , " Hey , it 's okay , okay . . . " " I 'll be home , okay . . . " It 's like a record he keeps playing over and over . He has to keep playing it , over and over . He ca n't leave it alone . He is losing his wife . . . HAYES It is n't true . POTTER I beg your pardon ? p. 62 HAYES What he told you . About me and him . About me . POTTER met you he asked you to dance . ( he puts a record on the stereo ) HAYES That 's very cheap . POTTER That 's true . But it 's true . HAYES Will you turn that thing off ? POTTER You know your problem ? HAYES I hate that record . POTTER You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not . POTTER Matt 's inarticulate . HAYES You got it . POTTER I know he 's inarticulate , but he knows , does n't he ? That when I say he talks about you , then the first thing you think is you have to deny it . The first thing you think is I know all your guilty secrets . HAYES I do n't have any guilty secrets . POTTER That 's right . Because we know it all . How you leave the bathroom in the morning . What you looked like when you went to high school . Where you keep the hand gun . With the socks . ( PANCHO has been carrying the gun since he took it from LAUREL . He puts it in the drawer on the set ) p. 63 HAYES Now listen , cowboy . . . POTTER Who cares , Laurel ? Want to trade ?

POTTER Why ? Because you know it all already ? HAYES That 's right . POTTER And that 's the way you 'd do it . By the book . So you 'd know what you were feeling since you knew what it was called . HAYES What 's wrong with that ? POTTER No wonder you married Matt . HAYES What do you mean ? p. 64 POTTER There 's more to it , that 's all . HAYES More than what ? POTTER Than what it 's called . Than you get from a how-to manual . ( PANCHO is leafing through The Joy of Sex . LAUREL does n't want to look ) There 's more than A fits into B. . . HAYES You want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? POTTER And five years later , he 's building monuments to you . . . HAYES On a soundstage in Kleinberg . POTTER Five years later , he can still see it , every frame of it . Like a film in his head playing over and over . With the music . . . HAYES I hate the music . POTTER With the water out there . HAYES There is no water out there . POTTER Matt can see it . And the sunset . Five years later . He can see you on the balcony . . . ( PANCHO turns off the lights on the set ) . . . in the very chic Borkmann recliner . . . ( He turns on one of the " sunset " lights to illuminate the cyclorama . It 's blue ) . . . every evening . ( He adds red ) . . . every sunset . ( He adds the sun 's disc ) Five years later , you 're still there for him . Five years later , he still sees you , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the middle of the night . p. 65 HAYES He does n't call me . POTTER We wrote a scene about it . For the picture . You know what I like about this picture . You know the one thing we 've got left ? The way Matt looks when he talks to you . HAYES He does n't talk to me . POTTER He does n't have to talk to you .

It 's bent , it 's wrong . . . HAYES It 's sentimental . It 's maudlin . POTTER It 's sad , it 's funny , but it 's a love story . And it has grand gestures , big mistakes . Because here is a guy who talks about you like I talk about film . . . Here is a guy who remembers the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . which lights were on . . . ( he turns on the interior lights ) HAYES He 's a psychopath . POTTER He 's a romantic . HAYES Matt has a number of vivid and appalling fantasies . And so , I see , do you . p. 66 POTTER Why not ? HAYES While I have a letter from Women 's Wear Daily . . . POTTER I know . HAYES Which is signed by Hap Kelly , Features Editor . In which he says he has been following my work . ( she produces the letter ) POTTER Is that it ? HAYES In which he quotes from my work . See . Here .

He 's last on the bill at some all night drive-in movie . He is up there riding to the rescue , but the paint is peeling off the screen . I know . I 'm up there with him . Step right up , folks . See it . Live . Laurel Hayes meets Matt Payne , Jr . We ran for three years , you know that . Three years with the battle of the century . Every night .

HAYES I quit my job , you know . Because of his undying love . ( Pause ) p. 69 POTTER Look , maybe you should be glad you quit your job . HAYES Oh , sure . POTTER Since you hated your job .

The film which is still looping is now washed out enough so it is n't distracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong with that ? PAYNE It is n't my image . POTTER That 's a key scene .

Look at that light . Look at that sky . It is slushy , is n't it ? Do n't tell me it will print up brighter . Do n't tell me to throw more light on it . It looks like slush . POTTER Do you know what happens in light like that ? ( ironic ) Not much . It is n't Carnival in Rio , that 's for sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bright white California sun . We ca n't put mariachi bands on Walmer Road . . . Incredible . You know what is credible in light like that ? You know what I believe ? There is some plot , some huge plot , I am at the centre of a gigantic plot . Some sinister secret power wants a film , wants a very bad film . To use as a secret weapon . Man with a Gun will bore people to death and I 'm responsible . Do you know how I feel in light like that ? I feel responsible . p. 118 PAYNE Hey , Pancho . . . POTTER I feel despair , I feel self-doubt , I feel suspicion , paranoia . . . PAYNE You sound depressed . . . POTTER But I also feel responsible , so there 's a happy ending .

I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins . I hate it when the dream dies , when that 's the message , that the dream dies . I hate it when it is n't possible . Whatever you want , it is n't possible .

PAYNE It 's the cars . POTTER It 's a cartoon , Matt . You are out there larger than life , you are walking around as if you knew the answers , as if all the answers beamed straight down from heaven like the desert sun , but the sun comes at you sideways in Toronto . It 's oblique . The light 's oblique . POTTER ( cont 'd ) You 're the only person in the picture with a suntan , have you noticed ? But we can use it . Well , we have to use it . If it looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong here . You 're an agent , sure why not ? You work for the CIA , that 's all right , that reads , but you 're up here in Toronto . What are you doing in Toronto ? ( MATT shrugs ) That 's right . You do n't know what you 're doing here ? This is some kind of plot .
