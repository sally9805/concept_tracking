 | Stefanie Powers was barely out of Hollywood High School when she signed a contract with Columbia Pictures . Two years later her career looked so promising that she was the main subject of a TV documentary called The Birth of a Star . The narrator assured the audience that Stefanie , then not yet 20 , was on the threshold of fabled Hollywood stardom . It did n't happen . In 1966-67 she was TV 's The Girl From U.N.C.L.E . She was told the show would be a surefire hit and that she would certainly be a star . It did n't happen . In 1977 Stefanie was tapped for another " guaranteed " hit TV series , The Feather and Father Gang . Again , stardom did n't happen for her . So who can blame her now , almost 22 years after she signed that first contract , if she does n't exactly take her success ( and stardom in ABC-TV 's Hart to Hart ) for granted ? " Everything in my life was designed for failure , " she says flatly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's realistic . That 's why I have n't really uncrossed my fingers yet . " When you become accustomed to the play not running , the series being canceled , or the movie never materializing , you 're always prepared for failure . You do n't think optimistically and you do n't program your life optimisti- cally . " Stefanie had expected Hart to Hart to be another failure , but now , as the program begins its fourth year , she 's warily starting to accept the fact that perhaps the show is a hit and she is a star . " I 'm just beginning to enjoy the success of the show , " she says , " and my own personal recognition with the public . For a long time after Hart to Hart was a hit , I did n't want to give interviews because I was afraid . At first I was scared it would n't succeed . Then I was afraid it would n't continue to be a success . You can go up and then down very quickly in this town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder why she should know about the down side of being up . She 's talented , gutsy , and completely professional . Besides , she 's so striking ? five feet seven inches , 117 pounds , with masses of auburn hair framing her intelligent face and those meltingly beautiful eyes that can be hazel or brown , depending on the light . At 39 she 's ample proof of the saying , " You 're not getting older , you 're getting better . " And while the disappointments in her career taught Stefanie the art of self-defense , they taught her two other important things : how to act , and the advantages of putting money away for , as she calls it , " long economic dry spells . " And she 's had those spells . After The Girl From U.N.C.L.E . was canceled , she did n't work in Hollywood for two years . But , happily , she married actor Gary Lockwood in 1967 and she joined him in Spain where he was making a movie . They traveled in Europe for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adored going to new places and learning new things . When she returned home it was still not to TV or films but to stage touring companies . Slowly , determinedly , she worked her way back to Hollywood where she tallied up a total of more than 100 TV guest spots and made-for-TV films . Along the line , her marriage to  | Lockwood quietly came to an end . Then something new began . In 1972 she met actor William Holden at a tennis tournament . A year later they ran into each other in Hong Kong , and that was the start of their very special relationship . Though he was almost 25 years older than she , it was a source of pride to them both that he did n't play the role of teacher to her student . They did n't need each other ? that was important to both of them ? but they wanted to be together . And all this time she kept working ? but never achieved stardom . But because she was prepared for failure , she survived . ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says wryly . " Hart to Hart is significant because it 's the first long period of success I 've had . It 's given my life a nicer balance . " ) Her failures also helped her bear the tragic deaths of Holden and Natalie Wood ? a friend and the wife of her costar , Robert Wagner . Holden died at 63 , last November , from a head injury suffered in a fall . Two weeks later , over Thanksgiving weekend , Natalie Wood drowned in a boating accident off Catalina Island . Stefanie is reluctant to talk about the deaths . She had known Natalie for a long time ? as teenagers , they took ballet classes together . ( Coincidentally , another member of the class was Jill St. John , the woman Wagner is reportedly now seeing . ) As for Holden , her feelings are just too private to be made public . " Of course I was stunned by their deaths , " she says . " But we all suffer the loss of important people , and we all somehow carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not unique to me by any means . I still feel that I 've been extraordinarily fortunate . I 'm not minimizing those two deaths . But there are an awful lot of people who suffer much worse things and still survive . " She 's thinking about some of the really dreadful things she 's seen in her world travels . Like a camp in Macao where last year she saw refugees waiting to get out and this year the same refugees were still waiting . " Still wanting and needing , " she says . " When I look at all the suffering in the world and then look at my life , I do n't believe I 've suffered that much . " It was because of Holden that she saw those things . She 'd always loved to travel , but in his company , that love turned into a passion . They traveled all over the world together . But their favorite place ? the place they returned to eight times in their nine years together ? was Kenya , in Africa . Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams for that country . She 's founded , partially with the $250,000 he left her in his will , The William Holden Wildlife Educational Center on his ranch in Nanyuki , Kenya . Also in his will , Holden specified that $80,000 be given to protect endangered species . When the trustees of Holden 's estate chose to give the money to the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife , Stefanie went to court to try to have the funds allocated instead to the William Holden Wildlife Fund . ? " The education center was Bill 's idea , " she says . " He would have gone ahead with it if he had lived . Although , certainly not in his name . " The whole point of the education center will be to maintain the ecological balance . She wants to stress what was so important to Holden ? that it 's our responsibility to protect the environment . " We 'll teach the local population that it 's possible for them to use conservation as a means of making a living , " she says . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect wildlife than it is to kill it . " I think the center will be a fitting memorial to Bill . He 's the one who did all the work . He was a man who , aside from my personal involvement with him , was an exceptional human being . He had things he wanted to accomplish . All I 'm doing is being the conduit for meeting those accomplishments . I 'll go to Africa once a year to keep up with it , as I have in the past . " I n Hollywood , Stefanie shares a beach house in Malibu and her more formal home in Beverly Hills with her mother . But now when she travels to all the places she once went with Holden ? Europe , Hong Kong , China , New Guinea , and , of course , Africa ? she goes alone . " Traveling alone in a strange country helps me sharpen all the little instincts , " she says , " like imagination and inventiveness , that get so dulled in ordinary life . I like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular trek once a year . I usually go to Peking , then Hong Kong , then either straight over to Europe and down to Africa , or vice-versa , and then home . " I go to Hong Kong because I love it . I have an apartment and some wonderful friends there . In mainland China I represent the Mount Kenya Game Ranch and the International Animal Exchange in a proposal for a very large exchange of animals with China . Once I get to Peking , I take little side trips to various outposts all by myself . " Quick to learn languages , Stefanie gets by in Chinese and is fluent in Spanish , Italian , and Polish , which she learned when she was still little Stefanie Zofja Federkievicz ( her real name ) , growing up in Hollywood . She comes back to Hollywood because that 's where her work is . " I set out to be an actress , " she says . " And I guess I wanted to be a star for the obvious reasons . Becoming a star gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the best people . " When she talks about stardom she ca n't shake a little sound of wonder in her voice . " Stardom gives me two wonderful perks , " she goes on . " Access  | and choice . If I want to visit the Jet Propulsion Laboratories , or to see the Voyager off in space , I can call someone who calls someone else and . . . it happens ! Ten years ago I could n't have done that . Stardom is also good for meeting people and going places ? which leads to information . I have no control over my insatiable curiosity . But that 's because life is fascinating to me , and I try to satisfy the full spectrum of my curiosity . " To her , stardom does n't mean designer clothes and jewels . She does collect antiques and sculpture , and there is one thing she really wants . " If I had one wish , it would be for a big motor sailboat . An ocean-going boat that I could take to the South China coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , her travels , and , possibly , with her memory of Holden , the one thing she does n't have time for just now is a man in her life . Usually so private , she seems to want to make the point that she 's alone ? perhaps because she 's wary of gossip linking her to Wagner . " There is no romance in my life , " she says firmly . " It would n't be fair to anyone . How can I ask anyone to be that tolerant ? A man ca n't have a relationship based on brief telephone conversations and stolen minutes . He ca n't have a relationship with a woman and not see her . It 's impossible for me to go out on weeknights ? even for a quick dinner . Agreed , a woman needs romance in her life . I miss it . But I do have a very full life without it . " So , she pays the price and counts her blessings ? without complaining . Still she does admit to one goal she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , " she says . " But how can I have children ? I have to be realistic . When the series comes to an end , I will have another sort of life . There will be time , I think , to do something else . " That time , she hopes , wo n't come for another couple of years . And she 's not afraid that while she 's working the right man will come along and , like a ship in the night , . pass her by unnoticed . " I do n't believe in ships passing in the night , " she says matter-of-factly . " In any case , this is what I 've worked for . You work for success and when you succeed , you ca n't complain about not having this or that . I 'd be stupid to delude myself into thinking this is not what I wanted . The prospects for a budding romance right now are nil , and I accept that . " It 's very difficult to even stay in touch with friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get home nine at night . It lobotomizes you . I did n't see that much of Bill the last three years , because I was working all the time , " she adds softly . I n this respect , she 's very different from the character she plays . Jennifer Hart is more than happy to put her man before her career . " Jennifer does n't have the options I do , " Stefanie says . " We are 180 degrees apart . Jennifer and I both appear to be fulfilled . We both seem to have everything we want in life , but in different ways . To me , life 's intoxicants are in the search ? not the discovery . That 's what I absolutely thrive on ? the beginnings of things . " That does n't mean she wants to begin other kinds of work right now . Besides Hart to Hart , she 's gotten many tempting offers for other roles . She 's said no to all of them . " I 'm on television even week , 22 times a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What purpose would it serve to demonstrate that I can do other things right now ? It 's enough that people stop me to say they watch the show and that R.J. ( Wagner ) and I are lucky we get to play such nice people . " She 's the first to admit that the chemistry of Jonathan and Jennifer might not work if she and Wagner were n't really good friends . " I ca n't imagine working with anyone else at this point , " she says . " He 's so easy and professional . such a terrific gentleman . He makes m work infinitely easier than I could ever imagine otherwise . " Jennifer Hart could not exist without Jonathan . Those two characters and the rapport we have in those roles could n't be realized with anyone but R.J. " And while she 's delighted to have Hart to Hart go on , in the back of her mind she 's got a little plan ticking away ? a plan that she could produce as well as star in . " Some years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fascinating book titled The Mandarins and the Barbarians , " she says . " It 's a history of foreigners in China from a Westerner 's point of view . It brings home to readers that when they visit China today what they are seeing is the result of centuries of a culture that can hardly be imagined I have this harebrained idea that we could make this book into a ten-hour miniseries for television . " She 's grinning now because it 's obvious that such a project would mean many months in China ? visiting nevi places , seeing things she 's never seen before . " Yes , of course , " she says , laughing . " It would mean that , would n't it ? " And that 's why it was worth all those disappointing years to finally become ... a star !
