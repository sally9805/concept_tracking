If you listen to pop radio or spend much time in dance clubs , you probably are familiar with a song titled " I Wan na Be a Cowboy , " by a band called Boys Don ' t Cry . Frequently described by listeners as " goofy " and " fun , " the tune pairs a thumping dance beat with tongue-in-cheek , deadpan vocals that are rife with saddle-pal imagery of horses , Indians and Western finery . The song is punctuated here and there by the sounds of tobacco spitting and loopy choruses of " Yippie-yi-yo . " ( If you listen closely , you can also hear lead singer Nick Richards punctuate the proceedings with some hearty coughing toward the song ' s end . He coughed because he was singing the song with a cigar stuck in the side of his mouth  --  a kind of homage to Clint Eastwood that just seemed right at the time . ) " Cowboy , " which recently reached No. 12 on Billboard ' s singles chart , is obviously something of a novelty record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit , is not a novelty act , and they understandably are a bit concerned that " Cowboy " might be giving American audiences a mistaken impression of the band . Concerned enough , in fact , that they quickly mounted a tour of the States  --  they arrive at Cabaret Metro Thursday  --  to show they do something other than off-the-wall material . " Yeah , obviously it ' s going to cause problems , " says Richards of the novelty ' s success . " One of the main reasons we ' ve come out on the road so quickly  --  most bands wouldn ' t come here until they had two or three hits under their belt  --  was basically to prove to everyone that we are a real band . We want to show we know what we ' re doing and that there are a lot more sides to the coin than ' Cowboy . ' That ' s just one track out of many . " And it ' s up to us now to come up with new stuff that ' s going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire ' ( a straightforward rock tune ) as the new single , just to show what we really are all about . " There is a lot of humor in our music . Although ' Cities on Fire ' is not humorous in itself , the video is pretty humorous . That ' s just something we get off on . We like humor in music . " But ' Cowboy ' was really a freak . It was a 12-hour recording session that went right . I wrote the lyrics in the studio . The drummer ' s girlfriend was there , so we put her on it . You know , anybody who was around . " I ' m absolutely addicted to spaghetti Westerns . We had that harmonica sound on the synthesizer right at the front , and that intro kept reminding me of spaghetti Westerns . I just came up with this phrase , ' I wan na be a cowboy , and you can be my cowgirl . ' It was so banal that we loved it . So we said , ' Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the hell of it , basically . We didn ' t think anyone else would laugh , but it was making us laugh . " The band specifically chose the name Boys Don ' t Cry , Richards says , because it doesn ' t typecast the group as playing one form of pop music . The name , he adds , was inspired by a line in an old 10cc song , " I ' m Not in Love , " that was current when Richards met his wife-to-be . In line with the don ' t-pigeonhole-us name , Richards sounds fairly vehement about keeping the band ' s music a mixed bag stylistically  --  even though this contradicts some conventional music-biz wisdom that contends listeners will get confused if a band doesn ' t have a single , definite sound . " We never want to be labeled musically because we want to experiment all the time , " Richards says . " We want to do dance , rock , mix them , put a bit of jazz in there . We want to do what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do by big record companies . The worst thing in the world would have been for our next single to have been another ' Cowboy . ' We can always go back to that if everything else fails , but we don ' t believe it will . " The history of Boys Don ' t Cry goes back to 1981 , when Richards and keyboard player Brian Chatton were both solo artists signed to RCA Records in the United Kingdom ( " and going nowhere , to be quite frank , " Richards says ) . The two met , began writing songs in 1983 and eventually recorded a number as Boys Don ' t Cry that did well in France . Richards and Chatton then met drummer Jeff Seopardie in 1984 and added him and bassist Mark Smith and guitarist Nico Ramsden to the group . The band released " I Wan na Be a Cowboy " in 1985 in England . The head of Profile Records , an independent American label , heard a copy of the song in New York and signed the band . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boys Don ' t Cry followed up with an album released about seven weeks ago . All the band members write songs , some of which have been recorded by artists such as Sheena Easton and Sad Cafe , and all have their own publishing deals . Chatton has signed with MCA Records to do a solo album next year , Richards says . " We all decided Boys Don ' t Cry would be our little nucleus band , something to go back to , " he says . " But we enjoy working with other people . It ' s good fun , it ' s experience , it ' s necessary , you know ? Boys Don ' t Cry isn ' t there to stop anyone doing what they want to do . " Richards is also part owner of the Maison Rouge recording studios in London . " They were owned before by Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull , and he approached a few of us , " Richards says . " He ' d bought this big salmon-fishing venture up in Scotland and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got lucky : The first project we did there was recording Wham ' s first album . Studios become ' in vogue ' very quickly , and suddenly we were packed , and there was money coming in . We gutted the studios , and they ' re both now 48- track solid state , the best you can get . The last time I looked , we had a number of records in the American charts that were done at Maison Rouge : Emerson , Lake &; Powell ; Fabulous Thunderbirds ; Blow Monkeys ; Level 42 ; Mike &; the Mechanics and Boys Don ' t Cry , of course . " I think our break-even figure for the studios is 9 , 000 pounds a week , about $16 , 000 a week . It ' s heavy . You have to be full all the time . Which , thank God , over the last three years we have been . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Nick Richards ( center ) of Boys Don ' t Cry : addicted to spaghetti Westerns .
