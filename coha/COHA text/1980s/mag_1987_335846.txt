If the U.S. Congress can be said to have a birthday , it must be July 16 , 1787 , when a Great Compromise brought the bicameral legislature into being . Two hundred years later , 25 Senators and 181 Representatives rolled north from Washington on a special 14-car train to a red-white-and-blue- buntinged Philadelphia in honor of the occasion . The original event at the Constitutional Convention was the resolution of a big state-little state fight that , presto , gave states equal standing in the Senate and strength reflecting population in the House . The anniversary proved a high point of Philadelphia 's occasionally turbulent Bicentennial festivities . <P> Although the celebrators ' attention was officially on the past , circumstances kept wrenching it back to the implacable present . Louisiana Congresswoman Lindy Boggs , resplendent in red , presided over solemn ceremonies in stately Independence Hall , while not far away some 100 supporters of the National Organization for Women demonstrated for an Equal Rights Amendment , chanting , " Hey ! Hey ! What do you say ! Ratify the ERA ! " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Byrd , alluding to disclosures of the Iran-contra abuses , cautioned against " habits of power that are inherently undemocratic and unconstitutional . " <P> In spite of tensions , the agenda of costumed pageantry , fife-and-drum music , jet overflights and solemn oratory came off with scarcely a hitch , thanks in part to security arrangements so heavy that when the congressional special rolled into Philadelphia 's 30th Street station , eight or so diners found themselves imprisoned for 15 minutes in a nearby McDonald 's after police blocked all the restaurant 's exits . <P> When 600 demonstrators rallied a block from Independence Hall for a lesbian and gay bill of rights , police on foot and horseback assiduously enforced a federal judge 's ruling that demonstrators could be heard but not seen : their constitutional rights did not include marching within sight of the main celebration . Hundreds of National Park Service rangers , Philadelphia police and U.S. Capitol police set up barricades and used metal detectors to check all visitors . <P> The ceremonies were split between Independence Hall and Congress Hall , where the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speechifying , it was that the capacity to produce such conciliatory agreements as the Great Compromise may be the genius of the American system . House Speaker Jim Wright praised the " art of honorable compromise , " adding a mild rebuke to the likes of Oliver North for ignoring congressional strictures : " Laws hammered out upon the blacksmith 's forge of compromise have commanded observance from even those who disagreed with the wisdom of the laws . And that is what real patriotism comes to . " <P> The dignitaries could hardly overlook the ironies and injustices embedded in the Constitution . Philadelphia Congressman William H. Gray , who is black , recalled that one direct legacy of the Great Compromise was the provision demanded by sparsely populated Southern states that each slave be counted as three-fifths of a person for purposes of representation . " But because the framers knew the inevitability of justice . . . " said Gray , " this nation has made such progress . "                   @ @
