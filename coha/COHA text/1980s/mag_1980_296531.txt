SERIAL Directed by Bill Persky Screenplay by Rich Eustis and Michael Elias <P> Cyra McFadden 's comic bestseller , The Serial , was as much journalism as satire . In order to devastate her prey , the trendy , upper-middle-class denizens of Marin County , Calif. , McFadden did not resort to barbed wisecracks : she merely let her characters speak for themselves . Like Director-Writer Paul Mazursky in Bob &; Carol &; Ted &; Alice , she understood that the affluent , desperate hipsters of the Far West are their own worst enemies . There is no point in making fun of people who are already self-parodies . <P> It is too bad that Mazursky did not buy the movie rights to McFadden 's book . Instead , they went to Sidney Beckerman , a producer whose credits include the legendary film desecration of Portnoy 's Complaint . Next to Serial , Portnoy seems like an earnest failure . Not only is McFadden 's cool point of view lost , but so are her satirical targets . Though Serial is set in the present-day San Francisco suburbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the characters are whining , repressed squares who , at heart , disapprove of free sex , drugs , divorce and teenagers . For some reason , they are all trapped in Marin County against their will . When , after 90 long minutes , some of them flee , the film makers are overjoyed . Hero Martin Mull 's retreat from an orgy to Wife Tuesday Weld is described in the same terms that Hollywood once used to celebrate the virtue of Doris Day . <P> Serial 's only attempts at contemporaneity are buzz words and phrases of the ' 60s and ' 70s . Whenever possible , " mellow " or " hot tub " or " finding my space " are worked into the dialogue . Most of the major gags , however , betray the film 's true sensibility by ridiculing big-breasted women and homosexuals . No actors or director could save this material . The cast and crew of Serial , largely recruited from television , do not even try .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
