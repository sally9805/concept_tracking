TV finds lost relatives <P> On a cold , windy day in 1951 , 25-year-old Kim Ok Soon was fleeing south before an invading Communist army in the countryside east of Seoul . Pausing for rest and a drink of water at a well , she left her young daughter with some fellow refugees . When she returned , the little girl was gone . That same year Kim Sung Soo , 8 , was separated from his mother in the wartime chaos around Chonan , 50 miles south of the capital . An aunt left him in an orphanage while she searched for his mother . She did not find her . Huh Hyun Chul , 9 , lost his four-year-old sister when she was left behind at a barbershop during the family 's flight from the war . These are but a few among millions of such stories from the Korean conflict . Now , thanks to some remarkably imaginative television programming , these three have ended happily . <P> So have thousands of others on a month-old telethon put on by the Seoul-based Korean Broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the show has reunited some 3,000 South Korean families sundered by the war . Mrs. Kim Ok Soon and her daughter came together last month . Kim Sung Soo and his mother finally found each other a few weeks ago . Huh Hyun Chul learned that his sister is alive and living in Cheju , a resort island off the southern coast . One elderly woman even found her long-lost sister seated in the same row with her at the studio . Both were going on the show in hopes of locating each other . <P> The program was conceived by Producer Ahn Kuk Jong , 39 , as the final two-hour episode in a project commemorating the Korean War . His purpose : to convey the hardships suffered by families pulled apart in the conflict . People were selected to appear on-camera for about 15 seconds at a time , carrying placards inscribed with their names , the names of the missing and a brief description of how they were separated . Announcers read the placards to viewers while the cameras zoomed in on the faces of the searchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers who thought they were being sought , or who recognized the placard bearers . <P> So overwhelming was the response to this original broadcast that the network immediately decided to continue the telethon for a total of 65 hours over the following eight days . Since then , the program has been moved into a regular twelve-hour time slot that begins on Friday nights . It has become by far the most popular TV show in South Korea , commanding as much as 78% of the viewing audience . Lee Won Hong , 54 , president of KBS-TV , attributes the telethon 's success in part to color television 's widespread acceptance in South Korea , but the show 's emotional impact and human drama are at least equally important . The on-the-air reunions are invariably heartrending , as years of anguish find release in paroxysms of joy and recognition . The program 's hosts are often misty-eyed and speechless , the viewers moved to tears .
