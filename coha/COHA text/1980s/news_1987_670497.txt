From the National Intelligence Officer for Near East and South Asia. // The U.S. faces a grim situation in developing a new policy toward Iran . Events are moving largely against our interests and we have few palatable alternatives . In bluntest form , the Khomeini regime is faltering and may be moving toward a moment of truth ; we will soon see a struggle for succession . . . . Our urgent need is to develop a broad spectrum of policy moves designed to give us some leverage in the face for influence in Teheran. . . . // It is imperative , however , that we perhaps think in terms of bolder - and perhaps riskier policy which will at least insure greater U.S. voices in the unfolding situation . Right now - unless we are very lucky indeed - we stand to gain nothing , and lose more , in the outcome of developments in Iran , which are all outside our control . <> <> CASPAR W. WEINBERGER <> Message to Robert C. McFarlane <> July 16 , 1985 // Several of the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider an explicit revision of our policy toward Iran as long as we continue to receive evidence of Iranian complicity in terrorist actions and planning against us. . . . // Under no circumstances , however , should we now ease our restriction on arms sales to Iran . Attempting to cut off arms while remaining neutral on sales to either belligerent is one of the few ways we have to protect our longer-range interests in both Iran and Iraq . A policy reversal would be seen as inexplicably inconsistent . . . . It would adversely affect our newly emerging relationship with Iraq . <> <> GEORGE P. SHULTZ <> Senate Intelligence Committee hearing <> December 1986 // I sent a message to Mr. McFarlane complaining about Mr. Ledeen ' s contact with the Israelis , which had bypassed both Ambassador Lewis and myself . I said that Israel ' s record of dealings with Iran indicates that Israel ' s agenda is not the same as ours , and an intelligence relationship with Israel concerning Iran might not be one upon which we could fully rely . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and analysis of the Iranian scene . I said in my message to Mr. McFarlane , " I am mystified about the way this situation has been handled and am concerned that it contains the seeds of further embarrassment and serious error unless straightened out quickly . " <> <> ROBERT C. MCFARLANE <> Interview with Tower Commission <> Feb. 21 , 1987 // I have felt since last November - and that is where we started - that it has been , I think , misleading , at least , and wrong , at worst , for me to overly gild the President ' s motives for his decision in this , to portray them as mostly directed toward political outcomes. // The President acknowledged those and recognized that those were clearly important . However , by the tenor of his questioning , which was oriented toward the hostages and timing of the hostages , from his recurrent virtually daily questioning just about welfare and do we have anything new and so forth , it is very clear that his concerns here were for the return of the hostages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a meeting while the President was hospitalized in July 1985. // McFarlane told him that we had a contact from Iranians whom he had reason to believe had reasonably good connections within Iran but who were on the outside , and this had come primarily as a result of Israeli connection with the Iranians. . . . // And what McFarlane wanted was the President ' s authority to make this contact , to see if it could be developed and what it could lead to . There was a discussion of the importance of Iran as far as its strategic location . . . and the fact that it seemed worthwhile to McFarlane that this be pursued. // The President , after asking quite a few questions - and I would say the discussion lasted for perhaps 20 , 25 minutes - assented and said yes , go ahead . Open it up. // On a meeting in late July or early August 1985. // I recall at that time the President expressing concern over this one-for-one type of swap and not wanting to get into arms sales through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance from Bud that they were ( a ) reliable or ( b ) could deliver on anything , and that we should go slow on this but develop the contact . <> <> ROBERT C. MCFARLANE <> Interview with commission // I recall the President calling me and I while I couldn ' t give you verbatim quotes or near it , his point , his opening point was about that matter we discussed the other day , the hostages . Well , the matter was a very big matter and in terms of purposes and so forth , but it was expressive of the kind of motives that I think that lend some urgency to his call. // He called and said : I think we ought to get on with that . Let ' s go ahead with that . And that , frankly , was more the way the President dealt with an issue , as opposed to saying : well , I like Option 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 . But I did then spell it out , and I said : Mr. President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel of weapons and ultimately them coming to us to buy replacements . And he says , Yes , I understand that . And I said do you understand , of course , now that George and Cap are very much opposed to this and they have very good reasons ? // And he said : Yes , I do , but I draw a difference between our dealing with people that are not terrorists and shipping arms to terrorists . And I ' m willing to defend that . And he even said something like : I will be glad to take all the heat for that. // But the point about the opposition from the Cabinet officers was made once more , and he said : Yes , I understand how they feel , but I want to go ahead with this . <> <> OLIVER L. NORTH <> Message to John M. Poindexter <> Dec. 4 , 1985 // It is very doubtful that a " single transaction " arrangement can be worked out with the parties in Teheran , no matter what is agreed to in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many times in the past that the attitude of distrust is very high on their part. . . . // Finally , there is the matter of the longer term strategy for what we should be attempting to accomplish viz a viz the Iran-Iraq war and a more reasonable government in Iran . From my personal discussions . . . it is apparent the Israelis want : the war to continue at a stalemate , a more moderate Iranian government in the end and will somehow find a way to continue getting their people ( Jews ) out of Iran through some kind of barter arrangement . In that the first two of their goals are , it would seem , generally congruent w/ our interests , and their last a fact of life , we should probably be seeing the return of the AmCit hostages as a subsidiary benefit - not the primary objective , though it may be a part of the necessary first steps . <> <> Message to McFarlane and Poindexter <> Dec. 9 , 1985 // If we are to prevent the death or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have four options available : <> <> Accept Gorbanifahr/Schwimmer ' s game plan : // - Stretch any replenishment to Israel over several months making it routine. // - 1 , 100 TOW ' s are maximum risk materielly sic . Cost and cover can be maintained by selling from stock to Israel over time. // - If hostages are recovered disclosure doesn ' t hurt much. // Raid and attempt rescue : // - If this option is pursued , then the military should be directed to execute by NLT next Saturday and talks with Gorbanifahr should be resumed in effort to hold Hizballah in check over the next 6 days . <> <> Allow the Israelis to deliver 400-500 TOW ' s while picking up 18 Hawks in effort to show good faith to both factions in Iran : // - This could cause Iran to deliver a hostage as sign of cooperation . It will also serve to boost Gorbanifahr ' s reputation. // - Israel could do this unilaterally and seek routine replacements. // - This gives U.S. more breathing time ( maybe ! ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. has , in fact , pursued earlier Presidential decision to play along with Gorbanifahr ' s plan . U.S. reversal now in midstream could ignite Iranian fire - hostages would be our minimum losses. // There is a fifth option which has not yet been discussed . We could , with appropriate covert action Finding , commence deliveries ourselves , using Secord as our conduit to control Gorbanifahr and delivery operations . This proposal has considerable merit . <> <> CASPAR W. WEINBERGER <> Interview with commission // The only time that I got the impression the President was for this thing was in January , which was Jan. 6 or 7 , and at that time it became very apparent to me that the cause I was supporting was lost and that the President was for it . And shortly after that , we got a call , I didn ' t , but Colin Powell did , I believe , from John Poindexter , who by that time had succeeded , saying there had been such a decision and the transfer of this initial set of arms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 , and went up to 4 , 000 , but they were to be transferred in amounts sort of as drawn. // But we were to transfer them to the C.I.A. and to nobody else . And I made clear that that was the only way that we would operate , that it had to be transferred to the C.I.A. , not directly by us to anyone else because we couldn ' t do that , and that it had to be an Economy Act transfer , which as you know , means we ' ve got to be paid value for it. // I said we would carry out the Commander in Chief ' s orders to do this . <> <> OLIVER L. NORTH <> Message to McFarlane <> Feb. 27 , 1986 // Believe we are indeed headed in the right direction . Just finished lengthy session w/ JMP he indicated that he has passed substance to you and has given me dates that you are not avail. // Will endeavor to sched. mtg so that these do not conflict but noted to JMP that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d msg fm Secord via secure device we are using . The Iranian official has again reaffirmed that once we have set a date we shall have a very pleasant surprise . Dick &; I believe that they may be preparing to release one of the hostages early . Dick also indicated that yr counterpart at the mtg wd be Rafsanjani . Nice crowd you run with ! God willing Shultz will buy onto this tomorrow when JMP briefs him . With the grace of the good Lord and a little more hard work we will very soon have five AmCits home and be on our way to a much more positive relationship than one which barters TOW ' s for lives. // I value your friendship and confidence very highly and did not mean to infer that you had revealed these exchanges . By asking that you not indicate same to JMP I was only informing that I had not told him anything of it so as not to compromise myself at a point in time when he needs to be absolutely certain that this can work . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure on this matter and very concerned that it go according to plan . My part in this was easy compared to his . I only had to deal with our enemies . He has to deal with the Cabinet . Many thanks for yr. trust . Warm regards . <> <> ROBERT C. MCFARLANE <> Message to North <> Feb. 27 , 1986 // Roger Ollie . Well done - if the world only knew how many times you have kept a semblance of intergrity and gumption to US policy , they would make you Secretary of State . But they can ' t know and would complain if they did - such is the state of democracy in the late 20th century. . . . // I have just gotten a note from John asking whether or not I could go some time next week and the President is on board .

If all this comes to pass it shd be one hell of a show . Meanwhile we have some evidence that Col Q. Qaddafi is attempting to buy the hostages in order to stage a propaganda extravaganza . As far fetched as this may seem , CIA believes it is a distinct possibility . Bottom line : believe you shd avail yrself of this paper at yr earliest convenience . Wd like to see you anyway .

Absence of anyone to receive us for over an hour and recurrent evidence anxiety ineptitude in even the most straightforward discourse makes it clear that we must take a step back from the history of the past 8 years and put out task in a different light. // It may be best for us to try to picture what it would be like if after nuclear attack , a surviving Tatar became Vice President ; a recent grad student became Secretary of State ; and a bookie became the interlocutor for all discourse with foreign countries . While the principals are a cut above this level of qualification the incompetence of the Iranian Government to do business requires a rethinking on our part of why there have been so many frustrating failures to deliver on their part . The other reason for the several snafus has been the extreme paranoia that dominates the thinking of the political leadership here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POINDEXTER <> Message to North <> June 11 , 1986 // On fund-raising for Nicaraguan rebels. // As I understand the law there is nothing that prevents State from getting involved in this now . To my knowledge Shultz knows nothing about the prior financing . I think it should stay that way . My concern was to find out what they were thinking so there would be a screw up . I asked Elliot at lunch . He said he had recommended Brunei where Shultz is going to visit . They have lots of money and very little to spend it on . It seems like a good prospect . Shultz agrees . I asked Elliot how the money could be transferred . He said he thought Shultz could just hand them an account number .

In short , we believe that a mix of factual and bogus information can be provided at this meeting which will satisfy their concerns about " good faith " and that we can use the " perishable " argument as an incentive for the Iranians to accept a C.I.A. communications team in Teheran . <> <> Message relayed to Poindexter from Frankfurt <> Oct. 29 , 1986 // Press guidance for a Presidential announcement of the release before it becomes known will be developed along lines of " The USG is grateful to all those who have assisted in this effort - and that two more AmCits have been released .
