( 58 // SURGE . IN GENERAL ASKS FOR MORE VOLUNTARY AIDS TESTING The question is legiti- mate , , but the denial is emphatic . " Absolutely not , " roars the man in the military dress whites . " Me run for president ? I would never be a candidate for elective office . " Case closed . Then he softens , almost smiles , and issues one of his famous Surgeon General 's warnings : " Anybody who comes anywhere near this office with that suggestion will be shot . " He 's kidding , of course  --  something C. Everett Koop does n't do with great regularity . An imposing man  --  all 6 ' 1 " , 206 pounds of him  --  he 's a gruff cross between Abraham Lincoln and one of the Smith Brothers . But he likes his job , and after six years of sitting in the hot seat at the Department of Health and Human Services , he 's warming up to the controversy of it all . He has every intention of completing the term that wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next administration , and he 's planned a full agenda . The reason his second four-year tour of duty does n't end with the changing of the guard is that his original battle for confirmation was the longest in history . The heated hearings that resulted in eventual confirmation proved to be a colorful preview of things to come . In fact , a favorite quip around Washington goes , " Where there 's Koop , there 's controversy . " Not true , Dr. Koop insists . " Until I was confirmed , the controversy centered on abortion , " he explains , referring to his well-known pro-life stance , documented in the two books and numerous articles he 's written on the subject . " I do n't think anybody who said I was incompetent really thought I was incompetent . The abortion issue made it look like my opponents had a real case against me . Then , from the time I was confirmed until AIDS became a major issue ' , I enjoyed an increasing acceptability by the press because I think they saw me not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of his mandate from Congress . I was presenting facts about health and disease prevention honestly and on target . And I 've done that with AIDS . " AIDS , however , has increased the media 's ongoing fascination with Koop . Surrounded by elected officials with more power and budget to initiate change , he 's still considered to be one of the hottest interviews in town . Gaining access to his L-shaped office on the seventh floor of the Hubert H. Humphrey Building is an exercise in patience and determination . Take a number and wait . Although his typical day is 12 hours long , he likes to spend most of it at his desk digging out from a backlog of work he estimates to be three days deep . Interviews are sometimes squeezed into coffee breaks and are often granted when he wants to share a particular message with a particular audience . Such was the case at the beginning of this year , when Dr. Koop made an all-out effort to convince leery church communities that school-age children need to understand their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of sexual abstinence , the importance of marital monogamy , and the good sense of condoms , a term some Christians prefer to avoid , to mention only in a whisper , or to disguise as the mysterious " c-word . " " No one in the Christian community who was in a position of leadership ever attacked me , " he reports about his campaign to reach the evangelical masses . " Nor did any Christian magazines attack me . They were extraordinarily cordial when I said I thought I 'd better spend my time in the beginning of 1987 talking to the church because I did n't think they understood the AIDS problem or its severity . Their response was remarkably good . Many of them used the media that they control  --  radio , television , and print  --  to get the message out , not just about AIDS , but about how people ca n't understand AIDS unless they understand their own sexuality . So , I 've been pleased . " The fruits of his efforts hang on his office wall  --  a gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peering down from each . The publications are an interesting mix  --  religious , medical , and general-interest magazines  --  and they underscore his emphatic statement that he is the Surgeon General of all the people , not just the special-interest groups that would like to claim him . His body of supporters seems to be growing , although at different points in the last six years he 's stepped on more toes than an out-of-sync waltz partner . He 's angered the tobacco industry with his call for a smoke-free society , alienated the women 's movement with his firm antiabortion views , and jolted some with his endorsement of sex education in the schools . Koop stands by his 36-page Surgeon General 's Report on AIDS , issued exactly one year ago and available at no cost to anyone requesting it . Congressmen have sent more than 12 million copies of the controversial and comprehensive document to their constituents . The booklet deals with the symptoms , prevention , and transmission of AIDS . It makes grim predictions ( 179,000 AIDS deaths by 1991 ) and urges preparation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous , " he says on the eve of its first anniversary . " Six months ago the controversy was ' What are we going to do about this terrible problem of sex education ? ' Now the problem is ' How soon can we get state legislatures to make sure our kids learn something about their own sexuality ? ' So we 've made progress on sex education , and we 've succeeded in teaching people what AIDS is all // 5 9 . // about and how it 's transmitted . " He grieves for victims already afflicted with the virus and frequently visits AIDS patients in hospitals across the country . His more than three decades as a renowned pediatric surgeon prepared him for dealing with terminally ill children , but youngsters born of AIDS-positive mothers and young hemophiliacs who contracted AIDS from tainted blood products are a special concern . " I went to Harlem Hospital with Dr. Koop to visit the children with AIDS , " recalls Jim Brown , the director of the Public Health Service 's news division . " The first child we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore blocks on both arms so he would n't hurt himself when he kept hitting the sides of the crib . It was obvious that he was going to die . Dr. Koop was moved but was able to cope as doctors are trained to do . But I found it difficult to go on . Both Dr. Koop and Dr. Windom the No. 2 official at the Department of Health and Human Services have called for volunteers to visit AIDS children in hospitals since many of them have been virtually abandoned because of their disease . " Koop 's current hospital rounds are ceremonial and are slated to boost spirits , not treat illnesses . At age 71 , he says he does n't miss the active practice of surgery , even when he reads about the recent separation of Siamese twins at Johns Hopkins Hospital . He was famous for the procedure at his home hospital in Philadelphia . " I stilt maintain contact with many of my old patients , " he says . " They write and tell me their news or ask for advice . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and What I got my kicks out of : finding the sore point of anxiety of a family and solving the problem . That , I liked . " In a sense , he 's still involved in problem solving . He 's still in the business of saving young people 's lives , only now his mission also includes changing young people 's lifestyles . He 's encouraged by new data that indicate post-college heterosexuals are moving away from high-risk behavior and toward monogamous relationships . Now he wants to concentrate efforts on preadolescents with the goal of raising a generation of youngsters who will practice abstinence until marriage . He knows skeptics scoff at the idea and call him idealistic , but he insists that success is possible . " They may laugh at me , but they say , ' Sure , try it , ' " he boasts . His greatest challenge is not with young married couples or with preteens . The people least likely to heed his advice on abstinence and monogamy are adolescents who have already become sexually active with one or more partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when you take a 17-year-old boy who has begun to have sexual relationships , he is almost never going to turn around and go back to abstinence . This is the group that is not going to listen to a just-say-no program ; so to them we have to say , ' Unless you are absolutely certain about your partner  --  and how can you be ? ? you 've got to protect yourself against AIDS . ' I recommend the use of a condom , knowing full well it 's not 100 percent safe , " Koop says . Koop is not afraid to talk about condoms , even to large audiences vocally split on the issue . When he addressed 6,000 people at the conservative National School Boards Association convention in San Francisco last April , a surprising standing ovation resulted . Any animosity was quickly dispelled when he opened with a joke about himself . He explained that unlike most of his predecessors , he likes wearing the official garb of the Surgeon General . The office carries the rank of a three-star admiral , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bars , epaulets , and ribbons . Once on a flight from Hawaii , he recalled for his audience , he was striding down the aisle of the plane when he paused to nod at two elderly tourists struggling to stuff packages of souvenirs under the seats in front of them . Mistaking Koop for an airline steward , the women beckoned him and gave him their sacks of treasures to deposit in the overhead compartments . The NSBA audience roared its approval and awarded the warm-up round to their guest speaker . Then Koop began delivering his hard punches : a plea for sex education and assurances that abstinence is best but that condoms have an important place in the real world . In the end , the decision was unanimous . Koop was a winner . Such openness has set a certain tone at the Public Health Service . Throughout PHS quarters in Washington , cartoons about condoms are tacked to bulletin boards , AIDS-related brochures produced by various state public-health departments He admits to feeling some frustration at having to deal with different sets of health laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recently compared notes with Britain 's minister of health and concluded that overseeing a country 's well-being is a lot easier if only one central governing body sets policy . " I 'm not saying they do it better in Europe , but if , for instance , you have a health problem in Finland , everyone speaks the same language , they all go to the same church , they all have the same kind of ideas , and 98 percent of them are sort of clones of the others . If the government health officer says , ' Do this ; do that , ' everyone answers , ' O.K. , we 'll do it . ' It does n't work that way here . When you want to do something in the way of an educational program in the United Kingdom , it comes out of the Department of Health . If you want to do it here , it comes out of 50 different places . " Nobody said it would be easy , and as Koop looks forward to his final two years in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it involves his old nemesis , abortion . President Reagan has asked him to prepare a report for the American people on the health and psychological effects of abortion on women . Whereas when he gathered information for his AIDS report he met with 26 groups of people who had a message for him , he 's already identified 150 groups that want to offer input on abortion . Beyond that , it will be business as usual . " 1 plan to continue to do what I 've been doing , " he says . " I 'll concentrate on smoking , AIDS , handicapped children , the sexual abuse of children , and the care of the elderly . " Such a jammed schedule merely underscores his refusal to consider a presidential bid . " My appointments for the abortion report take me through June , " he says . After that ? He says , " I 've got four book ideas running around in my head . "                  @ @ @
