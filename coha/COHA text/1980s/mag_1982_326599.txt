While the imposition of martial law in Poland has been resoundingly denounced by many leading Eurocommunists , the crackdown has failed to elicit the same kind of emotional response from Europe 's pacifists . Accustomed to portraying the U.S. as the chief threat to world peace , leaders of the antinuclear crusade have been confounded by General Wojciech Jaruzelski 's move against the Polish workers that had evidently been ordered by Moscow . In all of Europe , only a few thousand have demonstrated against Poland 's imposition of martial law , although more than 2 million people had turned out for anti-nuclear weapons rallies in major European cities last fall . <P> In West Germany , the key country in the antinuclear movement , the activists tended to approve of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt 's initial lukewarm reaction to Jaruzelski 's crackdown . Typical was the attitude of Erhard Eppler , a member of the national executive committee of Schmidt 's Social Democratic Party and a foe of the nuclear arms race . " For the most part , the peace movement was just as disgusted with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME Senior Correspondent William Rademaekers . " The events were a shock , but the shock was overshadowed by the very emotional reaction of the Reagan Administration . . . If there is any nation in the world that should not show too much indignation at military governments and martial laws , it is the U.S.-the world 's biggest backer of military regimes . " <P> At the first large gathering of the peace movement in West Germany since the military takeover in Poland , the Max Planck Institute 's Alfred Mechtersheimer argued in Frankfurt two weeks ago that the Polish crisis has " enlarged the danger of war , " but not so much because of what the Communists had done . The real problem was U.S. willingness to " take risks " in reacting to the crisis and " make every political crisis a potential point of departure for war in the erroneous belief that a nuclear war may be both conducted and limited . " <P> In Britain the Committee for Nuclear Disarmament condemned martial law in Poland . Its leaders , however , are unwilling to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the U.S. Says Bruce Kent , the C.N.D. head : " We will come in with the Americans when they will treat Turkey , Haiti and El Salvador the way they are treating Poland . " By far the strongest condemnation of the events in Poland was issued by the Dutch Inter-Church Peace Council , which had been one of the most effective peace groups that organized protests against the deployment of U.S. missiles . The council conceded that the situation in Poland had been an enormous setback for the pacifist movement . Said Council Leader Mient-Jan Faber : " We were bewildered and outraged .
