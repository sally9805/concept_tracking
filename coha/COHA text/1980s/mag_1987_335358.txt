" We do n't want to be conquerors , " says Shmuel Goren , Israel 's Defense Ministry coordinator for the occupied territories . Most of his fellow citizens no doubt share that sentiment . But Israel remains a conqueror , a country of 3.5 million Jews and 740,000 non-Jews that gained a quarter of its current territory by war in 1967 and ever since has ruled 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs by force . In just six days of fighting , Israel occupied 2,270 sq . mi. of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River , as well as the Golan Heights and the finger of Mediterranean seacoast known as the Gaza Strip . Last week , as Israelis prepared to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Six-Day War , they seemed as determined as ever to hold on to the West Bank . <P> For some people in Israel the issue is primarily religious , a fulfillment of God 's gift of Judea and Samaria to the Jews as his chosen people . For the majority of Israelis , however , the motivation for continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Egyptian troops sat 35 miles from Tel Aviv ; today Israel is protected by a peace treaty with Egypt and a wide stretch of desert between them . Before 1967 , Israel 's population centers were within rifle range of Jordanian troops ; today 40 miles of desert and a river separate Jordan from most Israelis . Before 1967 , much of northern Israel was vulnerable to Syrian fire from the Golan Heights ; today Israel controls , and indeed has formally annexed , that strategic plateau . <P> In exchange for peace , Israel agreed in 1979 to give the captured Sinai back to Egypt . But few Israelis are prepared to relinquish much of the other occupied lands . At a minimum , Israeli defense experts would insist on retaining control of the Jordan Valley , the string of hills stretching down the spine of the West Bank , and particularly the Golan Heights . To strengthen the argument that compromise is now possible , some Israelis point out that their country is no longer in danger of imminent annihilation , as it was in 1967 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are preoccupied by the fact that Israel is still besieged from within by frequent acts of random violence . A Jewish settler was killed a few weeks ago when her car was fire bombed on the road to the settlement of Alfei Menashe . In retaliation , settlers belonging to the extremist Gush Emunim movement rampaged through the nearby Arab town of Kalkilya . The West Bank 's Bir Zeit University has been closed for four months , following student rioting that left one Arab dead at the hands of Israeli soldiers . Occupation authorities have shut down the school eleven times in the past ten years . Two weeks ago , an eight-year-old Jewish boy was found murdered near the West Bank settlement of Elon Moreh . Almost no one in Israel doubts that the deed was committed by a Palestinian . <P> At heart , the vicious circle of resistance and repression testifies to the determination of both Palestinian and Israeli to possess the same land . To maintain control , Israeli officials have deported Arab leaders and have often destroyed the houses of those suspected of security violations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youths have been interrogated , collective punishment has been exacted , and prisoners have allegedly been beaten and tortured .
