WASHINGTON , April 27 - Following are excerpts from an address by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. to the annual meeting of the UnitedStates Chamber of Commerce heretoday as provided by the State Department : // The United States found it difficult to deal with the complex international situation that has emerged over the past decade . The economic growth of Western Europe and Japan , the Sino-Soviet conflict and the transfer of wealth to the oil producers have softened the sharp edges of American and Soviet dominance over the postwar world . The global military balance , however , is still the province of the superpowers. // Today it has become essential for the United States and its allies to deal with the new realities . Three trends in particular raise crucial questions about the prospects for Western security - and international peace - for the remainder of the century. // First , lagging Western strength . The United States has gradually lost many of the military advantages over the Soviet Union that once provided a margin of safety for the West - in some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , the Western alliance has suffered increasing poliical and economic strain. // Second , the increasing interdependence of the West and the developing countries , many of which adopt a strident public stance against Western interests and ideals . The third world has emerged in all of its diversity with its fragile unity already fragmented by regional conflict and global rivalry. // Third , the emergence of the Soviet Union as a global military power , increasingly bold in the use of its might to promote violence , notably in areas of strategic significance to the West . This trend has developed even as the Communist bloc , once the instrument of Soviet purposes , has been shaken by the Sino-Soviet schism and growing internal problems . Chronic economic failure has eroded the appeal of Marxist-Leninist ideology. // Let us ask ourselves , as others are surely asking about us , whether we can change these trends . I believe that we can . The American people have emerged from their recent experiences convinced anew that there is no substitute for American leadership if we are to live in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1980 ' s this new American consensus for a more vigorous defense of our interests demand a new balance in the style of our foreign policy. // A balanced American foreign policy sustained by this consensus will enable America to lead once again. // Ties to the Allies // First , our relationship with our allies . We can not pretend to lead unless we rally to our side those societies that share our values . We must recognize , however , that the trends of the past decade have contributed to a rising sense of frustration between the U.S. and its partners . U.S.-European relations , in particular , have been distressed by the convergence of several events : // - The loss of American strategic superiority and questions about the role of nuclear weapons in NATO strategy. // - Increasing European political and economic stakes in detente and East-West trade despite aggressive Soviet actions in Afghanistan , Poland and elsewhere. // - The recent record of low growth and high inflation among the industrial democracies leading to pressure for protectionist measures . <> <> Arguments Are Second Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the Soviet challenge , some Americans have been tempted to argue for withdrawal of American forces . Others , disturbed by persistent economic problems , have thought to retaliate by erecting protectionist barriers. // Arguments over burden-sharing are second nature to any large alliance of sovereign nations . The current trans-Atlantic exchanges , however , must be put in historical perspective . Americans should not forget that our NATO allies substantially increased their defense spending over the past decade while the United States was reducing its defense effort . Nor should we ignore that the European members of NATO supply a high percentage of the air , ground and naval forces that constitute the conventional portion of deterrence in Europe. // In the days ahead , as we and our allies discuss outstanding issues , the U.S. must exert not only strong but coherent leadership . The allies must know where we are going if we expect them to go with us. // Much of our agenda will be dominated by the search for more constructive relations with the East . This search , arms control and the military balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is essential that we carry out NATO ' s two track decision of 1979 to go forward with the modernization of intermediate range nuclear systems while simultaneosly pursuing arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union designed to limit these systems. // For too long we have pretended that a relaxation of tensions in Europe would be immune to Soviet attempts to change the balance of power . For too long we have imagined that the arms control process , in and of itself , could preserve the balance. // Finally , we should be conscious of our historic responsibilities as free societies in a world where individual liberty is too often suppressed. // The Third World // Let me turn now to another major area where we have a great opportunity for change : our relations with the developing nations . It is one of the ironies of our age that as nations have become more powerful their destinies have grown more interdependent. // Together , we and the leaders of the developing countries have an opportunity to make sure that this interdependence is a source of mutual benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The consequences of failure to cooperate would be disastrous for both America and the third world . But such cooperation must be based on the diverse realities of the present , not the slogans of the past. // The realities of diversity , conflict and great potential are bringing about a crucial shift in the attitudes of many third world nations . Their leaders face excruciating choices . Marxist-Leninist ideology has often been the locomotive that brought them to power but it has not become an engine for progress. // As a consequence , many countries with direct experience of the Soviet embrace are quietly attempting to broaden their relations , to encourage foreign investment and to reduce dependence on a patron who has little to offer but the tools and techniques of violence. // The Soviet Union // Finally , our country faces an historic opportunity in dealing with the Soviet Union . In the name of a utopian ideal , Soviet totalitarianism imposes a single social model not only on its own people but on an expanding empire . In contrast , the forces of democracy seek to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peaceful change . The competition between these two approaches will continue. // This rivalry , however , is constrained by another central fact of our time - nuclear weapons . Total victory by military means has become a formula for mutual catastrophe . Even the use of conventional force risks unpredictable consequences. // Our enduring challenge is therefore to develop and to sustain a relationship with the Soviet Union which recognizes that the competition will proceed but constrains the use or threat of force . We can develop a lasting framework for this relationship if we avoid the extremes that have distorted American foreign policy over the post war period : // - First , that expressions of American good will and readiness to negotiate could somehow substitute for American strength and would move U.S.-Soviet relations from competition to cooperation. // - Second , that a posture of confrontation , a refusal to negotiate , would somehow lead to capitulation by the other superpower . <> <> Moscow ' s Global Actions // The result of America ' s wishful thinking and profound national introspection has been swift and sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Vietnam , in Kampuchea , in Southern Africa and Ethiopia , in Afghanistan and now in Central America we have reaped the grim harvest of self-delusion. // As we rebuild our strength and seek once more to convince the Soviet Union that restraint is in our mutual interest , we must not allow ourselves the error of another extreme . We can not claim that we are too weak to negotiate and at the same time insist that we are strong enough for a policy of all-out confrontation. // An American approach to the Soviet Union that balances strength and negotiations offers the best hope of significant accomplishment . The Soviet attempt to change the balance of power has produced a backlash of increasing international resistance . Moscow has earned the fear and enmity of many nonaligned states through aggression in Afghanistan and support for Vietnam ' s subjugation of Kampuchea. // This backlash comes when Soviet prospects have dimmed . Moscow ' s allies are in deep economic trouble and the Soviet growth rate itself is declining . Agricultural shortfalls persist . Above all , as Poland has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the workers themselves . <> Messages for the Soviet Union // Over the decade of the 1980 ' s , as the Soviet Union experiences a transition in leadership , it is likely to face greater economic difficulties and growing international isolation - a marked change from an era of unusual stability and expansion. // During this sensitive and dangerous period of changing superpower relationships , the United States must make clear to the Soviet Union that there are penalties for aggression and incentives for restraint . We can not conduct business as usual in the face of Soviet adventurism in Afghanistan or Soviet-instigated repression in Poland. // An essential part of our strategy is to continue to differentiate among Communist countries themselves . This is a longstanding American policy that encourages autonomy and diversity. // Finally , just as the Soviet Union gives active support to Marxist-Leninist forces in the West and the South , we must give vigorous support to democratic forces wherever they are located - including countries which are now Communist . We want the competition of democracy and Communism to be conducted in peaceful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union insists upon violent methods of struggle . <> <> Continued Competition // In sum , the facts do not support the belief that there can be an early , sudden or dramatic reconciliation of Soviet and American interests . The competition will continue . But we can make the Soviets more cautious by our action . And as a new generation of Soviet leaders emerges , we can signal the benefits of greater restraint. // Ultimately , a foreign policy is the test of a nation ' s character . Today , the test of our character is whether we care enough about the values that make life worth living , the inner beliefs that have sustained Western civilization . Over the centuries , a certain idea of man has taken hold in our societies . The right of the individual , the responsibility of government to the governed and the rule of law have distinguished our way of life . These ideals are the true source of our strength and the true source of the weakness of our adversaries. //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
