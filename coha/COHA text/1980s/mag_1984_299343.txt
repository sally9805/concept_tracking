Eight o'clock in the evening is a slow , sullen hour in Sin City , a.k.a . Lost Wages . " I 'm tired , " whines a member of the United States Twirling Association . " C'm on , we 're supposed to be having fun , " snaps her companion , a clone . In razor-crease jeans and stiletto heels they stamp into the ladies ' room , flounce around the corner past the polished washbasins and disappear into the two long rows of toilet stalls . They are the kind of girls who obey their mothers ' warnings never to sit on strange toilet seats . Attendants have to nip in after that type , making sure the next woman will have no unpleasant surprises . That is the sort of job specification that made Donna Summer 's song about a ladies ' room attendant , She Works Hard for the Money , a big hit , especially in the neon city . <P> A circle of flattering pink mirrors catches multiple reflections of the plaster statue of Diana . On the dusty-rose settee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racist jokes and giggle . The attendant , who is black , has just unwrapped twelve rolls of toilet paper and is now dragging two huge bags of trash out the door . She passes an aghast English-speaking European tourist , who apparently expected Las Vegas to be more in the style of James Bond at Monte Carlo . <P> Two women on the far side of 45 stand next to each other before the washbasins , excavating makeup from the inside corners of their eyes . Vision restored , they notice they are wearing the same velour jogging suit . The turquoise version is from Pasadena , Calif. , the deep pink from Evanston , Ill . Imagine that ! Instant sisterhood . Evanston , who is in real estate and relaxes by playing the slots , says , " Have you got one of those rooms with the round bed and the mirror on the ceiling ? Just out of curiosity , I asked the bellboy what it would cost me to get some company . He said , ' It 's hard to get any kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should n't have any trouble on your own . ' So I checked out the craps tables . This adorable guy , my type , with the Southern drawl , the boots and the $500 chips , told me to step right up and be his good luck . Well , after ten minutes I realized I 'd have to stand there all night to shift his attention away from the table . " <P> " Yeah , " says Pasadena , " I 'm married to one of those kind of guys . " Pause . " Did you say $100 ? That seems sort of high . " Both women scrub hands blackened from pushing hundreds of coins into slot machines , and then each takes one thin quarter from the paper cup holding her slot-machine supplies and deposits it on the tip plate . An attendant , sweeping together the wreckage of paper products they have left behind , says , " Women do n't tip like men . Sometimes I do n't take home more than $6 in tips .
