A new old musical , The Pirates of Penzance , captures Broadway <P> It is a most improbable hit : a dusty , century-old operetta that nearly everybody has seen-and yawned at-in high school . <P> But there it is , packing them into Broadway 's biggest house night after night and sending them out into the frigid January air with silly smiles on their faces . But then this updated version of Gilbert and Sullivan 's The Pirates of Penzance has something few other musicals can boast of : absolute , unqualified , irresistible fun . <P> The plot is as lovably ridiculous as it always was . There is the priggish hero whose outlandish sense of duty has tied him to a pirate gang . ( His father had sent him off to become a ship 's pilot ; his nurse , being hard of hearing , mistook " pilot " for " pirate " and apprenticed him to brigands instead . ) There is the pretty girl he falls in love with , and her father , " the very model of a modern major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Tony Azito , and the pirates , so inept and soft-hearted that they will spare anybody who claims to be an orphan . After a time every ship they capture is unaccountably manned only by orphans . <P> Beneath all that frippery , however , is a work bursting with life , the hearty , beef-and-ale vitality of Victorian England . <P> " The play has always been done in such a rigid , lifeless way that people do n't realize how funny and vigorous the material is on the page , " says Director Wilford Leach , one of the prime movers of Joseph Papp 's New York Shakespeare Festival . " We wanted to do the play rather than people 's idea of it . We decided to scrape off the encrustations of tradition but remain faithful to the script . " <P> The production was first put on at Papp 's lovely outdoor theater in Central Park last July . To get the freshness he wanted , Leach hired two pop idols for the leads , Linda Ronstadt and Rex Smith . " We were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he explains . " I wanted pop singers to make us rehear the lines . " In fact , that seemingly odd casting was a master stroke , and both performers may be duly anointed as perfect in their parts . Ronstadt , 34 , looks as innocent as a fawn and is able to hit high notes that her rock fans probably never knew existed . Even she was surprised . " I discovered I had this other voice that I 'd forgotten about , " she says . " I had n't used my upper range since I was a child . " <P> Smith , 25 , was perhaps more of a gamble . The whole production rests on the ability of the hero to combine two opposites , a sweet but dumb charm and an almost arrogant self-confidence . Smith showed both in audition . " He came in and sang one note-B-flat-over and over , " recalls Leach , " and right off he informed us that he could pull it off . He even pulled Errol Flynn 's picture out of his wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Because I intend to swash until I buckle . ' Now , anyone who can say something like that in all seriousness can play Frederic , I told Joe . ' But can he sing ? ' Joe retorted . <P> <P> ' Well , ' I said , ' he can hit a B-flat . ' We hired him on the spot . " Adds Smith :
