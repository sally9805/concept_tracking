Ross Perot 's name is a house  --  hold word for any American who believes in initiative , hard work , traditional values and love of country . Ross Perot stuck to these basic beliefs in his pursuit of success and what he fervently and unasham  --  edly regards as the American dream . He is no phony . Even his detractors admit Perot 's patriotism and sense of purpose are real . His convictions , and a gumption and toughness forged in his East Texas upbringing , fired him to : * Build a $500-million-a-year computer-service business out of a $1,000 investment after he became impatient in the role of IBM 's star computer salesman . * Direct a commando team that penetrated deep into Khomeini 's Iran early in 1979 and , in a daring operation , rescued two of Perot 's executives from a prison housing 12,000 inmates and got them out of the country . * Head a citizens ' committee waging war on drugs , successfully persuading the Texas legislature to pass six tough antidrug laws , thus startling many cynical political observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fret over the persistence of a high unemployment rate ( it has been rising since 1970 ) , with some people quite anxious over the need for job creation , it is en  --  couraging to experience the confi  --  dence of a man such as Ross Perot . The 10.8 percent unemployment rate marking the closing weeks of 1982 is the saddest part of Amer  --  ica 's economic decline of the past decade . It caused doomsayers to cry for massive spending by the federal government to create " public " jobs , meaning more bureaucracy and , ultimately , greater frustration . Liberal and leftist organiza  --  tions demanded a return to " make-work " programs oper  --  ated during the ' 30s depres  --  sion  --  a revival of WPA and the Civilian Conservation Corps , to name two . Other political voices cried for pro  --  tectionist trade barriers or pork-barrel programs for their special interests . Ross Perot just shakes his head over this sort of panic . He knows the U.S. has a tough challenge to rebuild and re  --  structure its economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels for his country , he is convinced that government programs can not be the prime remedy . " Job creation must come from the highly productive private sec  --  tor , " he said in his cherry-paneled offices at Economic Data Systems , the Dallas company he founded . " When you try to create jobs in the public sector , you wind up adding to the tax burden , and this slows the economy . " Make-work jobs weaken a coun  --  try . They are to be avoided . By go  --  ing big into public-sector jobs , you develop a situation where nonpro  --  ductive people must be supported by productive people . " But he does n't see the reconstruction  --  tion of highways and bridges as a " make-work " program . The Rea  --  gan administration pushed Congress to raise the gasoline tax five cents a gallon so that a large-scale repair and construction project for dete ? pany in such a way that it grows and creates new jobs . He is serious about this , just as serious as he was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help go rescue his imprisoned ex  --  ecutives in Iran . " A businessman has a duty to his employees , his company and his country , " Perot says . " He must make that company successful , so it can add necessary jobs and broaden the nation 's tax base . That 's how private companies help the government cover its func  --  tions . Business and jobs build the nation 's economy and create prosperity . " It is a businessman 's job to make a product that is wanted and sells in the marketplace . It must be sold aggressively . Now , all this may not sound interesting to some peo  --  ple who say , ' ho-hum , ' but the truth is that there are no short cuts to creating jobs  --  no magic . It is fun  --  damental business practice and im  --  agination that creates jobs . " Perot 's success in business , par  --  ticularly the burgeoning computer field , is one of the spectacular sto  --  ries of our time . In 1957 , when he was 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He quickly blitzed the sales force and sold so many orders that IBM had to impose a yearly quota on the commissions an indi  --  vidual salesman could make . Perot says that he exceeded his entire year 's quota for 1962 only 19 days into that year , and that left him impatient and frustrated . So instead of sitting around thinking about golf or a larger home or a new car , Perot , on his own initiative , devel  --  oped the idea of " facilities manage  --  ment , " meaning a service that IBM could offer companies unfamiliar with setting up and operating com  --  puter systems . But IBM turned down his idea . The decision did n't cause Perot to fall into a funk . He regards such " failures " as being like skinned continued on page 94 94 Perot continued from page 51 knees , " painful but superficial . " He quit IBM , took $1,000 from his modest savings and founded EDS , a one-man corporation . Perot is five-foot-six , and his hair is as close-cropped as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can appear stern . Perot does n't complain , explains only what he has to and does n't flinch . Bullets could crease his eyebrows and he probably would n't blink . So at age 32 , he marched into the offices of executives and told them they should let him and the staff he was recruiting enter their premises , set up data-processing departments and operate them . In effect , Perot , the mighty mite of Texas , was telling these ex  --  ecutives , most of whom were not knowledgeable in this emerging , bewildering world of high technology , " Let us take this headache away , and we 'll run your data processing cheaper and more efficiently than you can . " Perot 's determination and conviction won him business . By 1968 , when he made his company public ( and became a temporary billionaire in the process ) , he was employing 303 peo  --  ple . Today , it 's 12,000 , and he 's still hiring . " Capitalism works , " he says , " it 's better than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing , and we put our financial re  --  sources into expansion . " We mostly hire young people out of college , and their training is more and more specialized . We made it our highest priority to hire Vietnam veterans before that war was even over . We have several thousand of them now . If you go across the top of my company , you will find many Vietnam veterans , and they are among the finest ex  --  ecutives in the computer industry . " So at a time when most executives are deep into cost-cutting measures and dreading the chore of laying off employees , Perot thinks about the new people needed to service the new business EDS is developing . In the past five years alone , EDS has // increased its net income by 178 per  --  cent , its total revenue , 242 percent . EDS is no longer a spectacular new entrepreneurial success . In 20 years , it has become a mature com  --  pany , and Perot was intelligent enough to realize it could n't always be a one-man show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to Morton H. Meyerson , now EDS president , and oversees his company ( he owns 53 percent of the stock ) from the board chairman 's position . " We are in a highly competitive industry , " Perot says . " We are con  --  stantly providing new computer service for our customers . We are currently developing software for the home-computer market . You know how that market is growing . That means more jobs . " The man really means it ; he is not putting out rhetoric for the Tuesday luncheon of a civic club . Perot 's record shows he does what he thinks is right and will take punishment for his action if need be . Just before Christmas 1969 , Perot chartered two 707s , loaded them full of Christmas dinners and went to Vietnam in hopes of serving this wonderful cargo to American prisoners of war in Hanoi . When that mission failed , he was scoffed at and made fun of . The penalty came four months later when , in a single day , Perot lost $450 million as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confidence in the company April ' 83 run by the " Lone Star Santa Claus , " as one headline called him . That did n't shake him . Less than a year later , he was on Wall Street , pumping money into a brokerage firm in trouble , saving it ( in a civic way , perhaps , because his rescue averted a panic ) . Perot became an authentic legend because of another rescue opera  --  tion , the one he directed in early 1979 in order to free his executives , held for an incredible bail of $12.5 million . He had recruited a 15-man " commando squad " from his own company and got an ex-Green Beret colonel , Arthur " Bull " Simons , to direct the mission . Perot used a forged pass  --  port to enter Iran and , luckily , arrived at the prison when an American State Department official was there inquiring about Perot 's executives . Prison authorities thought Perot was also a U.S. official , so they let him go to the cell . The faces of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told them quietly that he was arranging a prison riot , that they should wait until the cell doors were open and the guards gone and then come to a car at a given location . It all worked . The riot broke out , 12,000 prisoners ran out , and Perot 's men escaped to the Turkish border . The success was due to the daring of Perot 's commando team and to the rather large amounts of money Perot spread around to will  --  ing Iranians . " De Toqueville said America is great because Americans are good , " says Perot , reflecting on that suc  --  cess . " Patriotism is not some mind  --  less flag-waving jingoism , as critics charge . Patriotism is doing what our people did on that mission . It is love of country . " When the Carter administration tried to rescue the hostages and had that tragic failure , the same people who went with us to Iran came to me at 8:30 a.m. that morning and volunteered to go back if they could rescue those left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on following page 96 Perot continued from page 94 just marvelous . " Our team was asked to consult with the federal government before that effort . But we had a strong dif  --  ference of opinion with some of the military and with White House staffers . There was a lack of direc  --  tion and go-go spirit at the White House . And Carter was so indeci  --  sive . In a situation like that , you put the right crew together and let them go . Let them size it up and minimize the casualties and carry out their mission . You do n't treat them like robots . " Perot prefers " love of country " to the term , " patriotism . " Super  --  salesman that he is , he is also shy and does n't like being called a " patri  --  ot . " He actually has a logic worked out about " love of country . " " It is important for people to have this feeling , " he says , " so that they can continue to en  --  joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make changes to fit the current need . " You know , the Mor  --  mon Church requires its young people to give one year of service , and it 's called a mission . Well , I endorse that , and our government should have the same requirement : Every young American should go on a mission of service to his or her country . " At some time in your life , you should give a year or two to your coun  --  try . I would n't call it conscription . ' I would call it ' Service to Coun  --  try . ' Every 18-year-old could work on jobs like conservation projects , hospital service or help  --  ing older people . It would have to have substance and be well organized . " That young person would come out with an understanding of service , of being less selfish and of people . Finally , that young person would have worked around govern  --  ment and would there  --  fore know what it can do // and what its limitations are . That youngster would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do everything . When we look to government to solve all our prob  --  lems , government tends to spend huge amounts of money , and then it fails . The War on Poverty is a perfect example . " The United States can be any  --  thing it wants to be . But we must teach our children that the freedom we take for granted can be fragile . We must teach that they have obli  --  gations to their country , that the country is not a magic box to serve them . " We now expect life to be so ex  --  traordinarily good to us that we must be paid $20 an hour for a job that you could train a monkey to do  --  or we think the world is being unfair . The real lesson is that , if you give a lot to the world , the world will give a lot to you . " 1 was taught this at home , at Where do you think you are ? April ' 83 school and at the Naval Academy . I was taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . We were painstakingly taught the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution , the Bill of Rights . It is no accident that Texas children , taught about their state , are proud of it and their country . " Communist children are taught communism and to love their coun  --  try . They know more about their countries than our children do about ours today . It 's no contest when a Russian or a Chinaman is having a dialogue with one of us  --  they have the encyclopedic knowl  --  edge of their country . " This is partly because we 've been through 25 years of fads in education  --  new math , new alpha  --  bet , new style of reading  --  whatever some professor could come up with . Out of that , we produced a genera  --  tion of children who cai n't figure , cai n't read , cai n't spell . " I am a great believer in creativity and innova  --  tion , but these people went wild with fads and trends . And our children have shied away from hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and that , but they do n't want any  --  thing hard , and they cer  --  tainly do n't want engi  --  neering . " You walk into an en  --  gineering school today and you think you are in the Orient . Those are n't Japanese-Americans in those classes  --  those are Japanese , and they are flooding our schools . We 've got to change that ; we 've got to get dis  --  cipline and hard courses back for our children . " The typical Russian student has an awesome amount of math . Our fu  --  ture economy is based on a technology requiring more math and disci  --  pline . We do our young people a disservice by en  --  couraging them to take the easy path . " It was Perot 's concern about young people tak  --  ing the path to drugs that caused him to accept in // 1979 then-Governor William Clem  --  ents ' request to head the state 's anti  --  drug program . Perot had already spoken out many times against drugs , using church and civic meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustered some 700,000 volunteers  --  including parents , teachers and students  --  to join his antidrug crusade . The state PTA led this legion . And Perot showed the world once more that he meant business . Instead of issuing the usual com  --  mittee report and platitude-laden statements , Perot had hard-hitting speeches , did a cram course on drug abuse and financed a full-blown campaign against drugs out of his own pocket . Finally , he came up with a legis  --  lative program , vigorously solicited the legislature and warned that the " drug lobby " would fight him and the " Texas War on Drugs . " By spring 1981 , Perot had per  --  suaded the legislature to pass a series of laws to stop the sale and flow of illicit drugs in Texas . Soon after , physicians were complaining that Perot made them run the risk of criminality , and some legislators griped that Perot ran roughshod over them . Whatever , today there are no tougher antidrug laws in the U.S. than those in Texas . Ross Perot 's real first name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cotton broker in Texarkana , Texas , June 27 , 1930 . He was a news  --  paper carrier boy , broke in horses for his father , became an Eagle Scout and president of the student council at Junior College . In 1949 , he got himself an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy . He served eight years in the Navy , four of those years on an aircraft carrier . Some  --  how , he wound up as his ship 's offi  --  cial greeter and one day met an IBM executive who was touring the ship . Soon thereafter , Perot decided the Navy was too slow for him , so he resigned and joined IBM in 1957 . By now , he had a strong interest in philosophy and , while he was out in the daily sales grind , mused over thoughts of the great . One was Henry David Thoreau , whose dec  --  laration , " The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation , " stuck in Perot 's mind as he worked the Dallas business beat for IBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So on his 32nd birthday , Perot left IBM and incorporated EDS . Dallas , with its large banking and insurance industry , was a prime market for the computer services he offered . Perot plunged into his new work with a fer  --  vor that could only match that of a fundamentalist preacher . He hired young men who would adhere to his dress code : dark , conservative suits , white shirts , single-color ties , no beards or mustaches were allowed . They became known as the " warrior saints " of the " Dallas Crusader . " It is ironic that Perot 's business boomed because of one of the great accomplishments of President Lyndon B. Johnson 's " Great Socie  --  ty , " the Medicaid and Medicare systems . These huge federal payment programs begged for computer services , and Perot 's EDS supplied them . EDS was so highly regarded by Wall Street that , when Perot went public with his company in 1968 , he immediately became worth $1.5 bil  --  lion on paper . The enor  --  mous publicity that gathered round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect even more on the mean  --  ing of life and his beliefs in God , country , his family and himself . The media made him a star in sometimes unflat  --  tering terms . He was variously called " Ameri  --  ca 's first welfare bil  --  lionaire " . . . " The com  --  mando leader of the free enterprise system " . . . " A Promethean Patri  --  ot " . . . " Texas Titan " . . . and " Right-Wing Yippie . " " I ignore any kidding about my love of coun  --  try , " Perot says . " My in  --  terest in this country is deep , complex and very well thought out . Simply put , we just ca n't take from our country , we must also give . It is easy to criticize the dirty river . It 's a challenge to clean it up . " The media likes to deal in per  --  sonalities . It sells newspapers and magazines and makes television . Right now , the media is going big on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of work . But that one person 's plight does n't have any  --  thing to do with the big picture . It is human , touching and heart rending . Therefore , it produces , on televi  --  sion , an audience share , ratings and higher advertising rates . " I only wish that it became good business for the entertainment in  --  industry to go patriotic . The current trend in schools and elsewhere to feel apologetic for teaching the peo ? pie the values of our country might change . Maybe even television come  --  dians , with all their influence , might show some love of country . " Ross Perot really means what he says . In the top floor office suite at EDS , there hangs an authentic Gilbert Stuart painting of George Washington . He enthusiastically tells you about it . There is a " Spirit of ' 76 " painting by Willard  --  the real McCoy . There is a bronze cast  --  ing of Remington 's " Bronco Buster " ? the genuine article . There are Norman Rockwell signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting of an American POW in a North Vietnamese prison ; and a photo of released POWs with the signatures of all those thanking Perot for his help in freeing them . Perot is the man who gave each of the 52 hostages held in Kho  --  meini 's Iran an American flag he flew all 442 days they were held captive . Perot is the man who worked as hard as anyone did to settle the dispute over the " V " - shaped memorial to the Vietnam veterans so that a proper tribute would also be presented to them along with the controversial piece of sculpture in Washington . More important than any of this , of course , is Perot 's undying love of country and his unwaver  --  ing belief that Americans will eventually be able to work out their problems . " It 's immature to think that the U.S. econ  --  omy is going down , as some do today , " he says of the doomsayers . " This is a country where people can change things . We have control over our destiny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you straight in the eye and declares : " The love of our country is very fun  --  damental to the success of our great country . That 's what every last one of us must keep in mind . "
