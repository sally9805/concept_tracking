Chicago Schools Supt. Manford Byrd Jr. said Tuesday that if he is not offered a pay raise with a short-term extension of his contract , he would have little incentive for heading the school system . The Chicago Board of Education is backing away from a $25 , 000 salary increase sought by Byrd , whose four-year contract expires March 24 . The increase would bring his yearly salary to $125 , 000 with the possibility of a $10 , 000 bonus . It would also increase his pension by $5 , 015 to a total of about $98 , 000 a year . " I took a $20 , 000 pay cut when I came to the ( post ) , " Byrd said . " I am not asking for any special consideration , and it was not a demand . " But if I get all my figures out , the question would be why stay ? I was trying to fashion it in such a way that I did not wind up taking a financial decrease , " he said . Byrd , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his predecessor , Ruth B. Love , who was paid $120 , 000 annually . At the time , Love was the highest paid school official in the country . Chicago , the third largest school system in the country , has now fallen behind New York , Los Angeles , Dade County , Fla. , and several other cities in superintendent pay . The board is seeking to extend Byrd ' s contract for up to one year until a nationwide search , slowed by a lengthy debate over school reform legislation , is completed . If , however , Byrd does not wish to remain , the board would appoint an interim or acting superintendent . " I think it stands to reason anybody who wants to stay in this job would seek a pay increase , " board member Patricia O ' Hern said . " But we also have to be fair to the taxpayers . " Byrd ' s request comes on the heels of an estimated $250 , 000 buyout deal awarded to Robert Paaswell in return for his resignation as CTA executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rotella stepped down with two years left on his contract , he was given a $330 , 000 golden parachute . Both set the stage for Byrd ' s proposal . However , the school board , in an effort to boost its public credibility , may be backing away from any type of salary increase . " I don ' t think this board can maintain any little credibility that ' s left if we were to give him a raise , " said one board member , who asked not to be identified . Some board members may also be pushing for a resolution before the Feb. 28 primary because it would reflect favorably on the board ' s commitment to move ahead with reform and not be influenced by politics . " It might be a sense of relief if he does decide to say either up my salary or I ' m not going to stay ' because publicly the board would look good , " one source said . " And , if they do this prior to the election , it looks like they exerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf . " While Byrd ' s base salary is lower than Love ' s was , he has collected a total of $51 , 154 in pay for unused vacation days in his career , including $30 , 385 before 1987 . Byrd , covered by the Chicago Teacher Pension Plan , has also received $18 , 000 in bonuses and $28 , 000 in school board pension contributions . He is also entitled to $66 , 220 in severance pay . Since he has been with the system for more than 38 years , Byrd would receive 75 percent of the average of his four highest salaries in the last 10 years . That average includes the unused sick and vacation days.
