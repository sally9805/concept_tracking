" You movie people , you 're a bunch of spoiled brats ! " yells a man whose car has just been rammed by a star 's convertible . Yes , we nod in agreement , and they 're phony too , and beneath the glamour not very happy . Tales from the Hollywood Hills , a trio of short-story adaptations set in Tinseltown during the 1930s , trots out all the beloved stereotypes while flavorfully recapturing Hollywood 's legendary golden age . Then , boldly , the mini-series abandons the legend and goes for a more subtly shaded truth . <P> Three star-quality performances help . In Natica Jackson , Michelle Pfeiffer plays a pampered screen beauty who falls for a married man . John O'Hara 's tale has a bitter twist , and Pfeiffer adds her own tasty mix of sweetness and vinegar . A Table at Ciro 's , from a Budd Schulberg story , resorts to broader caricature , as some familiar Hollywood types ( washed-up director , naive ingenue , swaggering Latin lover ) gather at a dinner hosted by a powerful studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bemused dignity that the character seems brand new . <P> As a seedy hack screenwriter in Pat Hobby Teamed with Genius , Christopher Lloyd may have the toughest job of all ; the invitation to ham it up is virtually flashed in neon . Cobbled together from three stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald , the episode is a bit sketchy and disjointed , but Lloyd fills the screen with a funny yet carefully modulated portrait . Watch him try to con a tourist couple by rattling off a list of bogus screenwriting credits , casually mispronouncing Ninotchka . Or , slumped on a couch , lamenting to a friend ( Dennis Franz ) that he has come up empty on a script the studio needs that afternoon : " Put a fork in me , Lou , I 'm done . " Cut and print .
