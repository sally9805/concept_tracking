THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN a single day , a gentleman of our acquaintance received in the mail four identical printed messages from Citibank , They read as follows : A deposit for $935.59 was credited to your account . The actual total of your deposit was $935.59 . Because of the error in addition , a credit of $.00 has been made to your account . This will appear on your statement with the description " deposit error . " T raffle TN an endless stream of cars on , say , F.D.R. Drive , a novelist sees a million stories  --  that man visiting his girlfriend , this one looking for the exit to ennui . The salesman of whitewall tires or fuzzy dice sees opportunity . Small insects , probably , see a horrid cataract of windshields not to bash against . And Samuel I. Schwartz sees ( Vehicle Miles Travelled ) 1 , , = a D i+D2+Dx+Dn x=1 where D is the distance that vehicle x travels in an hour , and n is the total number of vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-sixyear-old man with a bushy reddish-brown beard , is deputy commissioner of transportation in charge of traffic for the City of New York , a former cabby , and the winner of an award from the national Institute of Transportation Engineers for his equations regarding VIM , or Vehicles in Motion , which made it possible to determine the maximum number of taxicabs ( fifteen thousand six hundred and forty-four ) that New York could license without slowing traffic down to whatever is below a crawl  --  perhaps a snail 's pace . We heard Mr. Schwartz address the City Club last month , and we visited him a few days later in his office , and whereas we once knew only that traffic was slow we now know how slow . Some numbers : twenty-five per cent of all cars parked illegally in midtown Manhattan are limousines ; delays at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel are peaking at thirty-seven minutes these days , up from sixteen minutes five years ago ; if Veterans Day falls on a Friday , traffic is nine per cent above normal , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent ; there is one car for every four people in New York City , compared with one for every 1.8 in the rest of the country ; and so on . The numbers show two big developments since the Second World War , Schwartz told the City Club  --  falling subway ridership and dramatic increases in auto volume . And in his office he told us , " More people were coming into the central business district in 1948 , but they were arriving differently ; the situation underground has become relatively intolerable , and this has made the situation above- ground relatively intolerable . Weekly , we flirt with gridlock . " Schwartz is the Captain Ahab of gridlock , hor- rified and yet bewitched . He was in the room when the word  --  meaning traffic paralyzed past movement in all direc- tions  --  was coined , in the early nine- teen-seventies ( he may have used it first ; no one remembers ) ; and when we raised the topic he buzzed . on his inter- com and said , " Rhonda , the gridlock file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sifted through the stack of clippings , each using the word in a different way : " ' Interest rate gridlock ' ' Football Talks Gridlocked ' . . . ' Corporate gridlock ' ? that 's where you stagnate in your job . It 's every- where ! " But in the past few years stepped-up towing and new traffic- flow plans have helped some , he said . The average speed on the avenue increased from eight miles per hour to nine and a half , and on cross- town streets from 4.7 to 5.9 . On the East River bridges , Schwartz has installed a fleet of Minuteman tow trucks for instant response to disabled vehicles . " If we lose lanes on those bridges , we have a cattle-chute ef- fect  --  it 's like a cow stuck in a chute . So we have trucks at each , just wait- ing . As a result , " he said , a grin spreading across his bearded face , " since November , 1982 , there have been seven thousand one hundred and twenty-seven traffic jams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who made nothing of Atlantic storms , once declared he would rather double Cape Horn than cross Broadway in a jam . " That quotation from a nineteenth-century issue of Harper 's Weekly sets the tone for an exhibition of pictures of  --  well , traffic jams , which is currently on display at the Museum of the City of New York . The show is called " Gotham in Gridlock . " There are pictures of the Cross Bronx Expressway and of Queens Plaza , of Forty-seventh Street , and of Surf Avenue in Brooklyn . There are wood engravings of South Ferry and ? the oldest piece in the show  --  of the City Hall area clogged with traffic a half century before the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge . There are pictures of horses and carriages , of trolleys , of cars , of trucks and buses , and what all the vehicles have in common is that they are stuck in traffic . From every one of those pictures , 4-0 a voice seems to say , " There must be an accident . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  someone asked when Fifth Avenue was made one-way , and the answer turned out to be 1966 ? and I got generally fascinated with traffic , " Nancy Kessler-Post , the curator of the exhibit , told us . " Horses were a big problem once . You ca n't really just put on the brakes with horses . Given the size of Manhattan and the number of vehicles that insist on coming here , I imagine that in a hundred years my successor will be able to do pretty much the same exhibit . " The exhibit , which will be open through April 1st , contains drawings illustrating a number of proposals of ways to cure the city 's traffic problems , including Speer 's Endless Railway Train , operating on a raised track that passes not only stations but also " Ladies Drawing Rooms , " and a proposal for a new Manhattan street beginning at Fifth and Fifty-first and cutting east to the river at about Sixtieth . " King 's Dream of New York , " dated 1908 , describes it self as " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later times ... when the wonders of 1908 ? the Singer Building , six hundred and twelve feet high with offices on the forty-first floor , and the Metropolitan Life tower , six hundred and fifty eight feet high  --  will be far outdone , " and the weird thought goes on , " Now nearly a million people do business here ; by 1930 , it is estimated the number will be doubled , necessitating tiers of sidewalks land bridges between the structural heights . Airships , too , may connect us with all the world . What will posterity develop ? " In the entire gallery , there is one picture of an open road free of traffic , and that is a recent shot of the sun setting over a desolate abandoned stretch of the West Side Highway . ? NE thing that posterity devel- oped , and pretty quickly , was the Holland Tunnel . Late one night last week , when the tunnel had been closed to all but construction workers , we found ourself up in , of all places , the MARCH 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high at the center , between the tunnel ceiling and the concrete-lined outside iron ring that encases the tunnel and helps keep the water out . " The Hudson is a few yards from your head , " Robert Richter , a construction consultant who is helping to design a new ceiling for the tunnel , told us merrily . Hunched over , we walked down the dark attic of the tunnel and listened to Mr. Richter explain his project . " I started out in exterior-wall systems , " he told us . " To me , a ceiling is just a wall turned ninety degrees . When people talk about our aging infrastruc-ture , they 're talking about things like the Holland Tunnel . In the nineteen-twenties , when it was built , it was state of the art . And the state of the art has n't changed that much in the years since . But the tunnel has got almost sixty years old . It 's reacted to that age ; it 's almost like a living thing . The temperature in the tunnel , for in-stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete and the iron expand and contract . There are cracks in the ceiling above the road  --  but not in the iron ring , which is structurally sound ? and it 's come time to think of putting in a new ceiling . The Port Authority wants it done right , so it hired the contractor I work for to test a hunch of different materials . As finishing materials , we have two kinds of tile  --  German and Swedish  --  and con-crete , aggregate , and steel . The first step was to build cross-sections of the ceiling base  --  one a panel of pre-stressed concrete , the other a panel of pre-cast con-crete  --  out in Pennsyl-vania and test them for strength . We piled con-crete blocks on them for hours ; they only had to support eighty-three pounds per square foot , and neither one had any trouble with eight hun-dred . Once we have the test panels installed in the tunnel , I have to de-sign a test to simulate what will happen if a truck scrapes its top THE NEW YORKEft along the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the yellow beam of his flashlight , how the tunnel had been built originally : the concrete hauled up to form the ceiling , the arch carefully formed and shaped . " You have to give great thanks to the early engineers and builders , " he told us . " Here 's something that they built almost sixty years ago , and there 's only a problem with one small part of it . And they were building it for the first time . It 's incredible . And I 'd just like to do as well  --  I really would . " ? TT was 5 P.M. , and a disabled tractor-trailer truck had the Major Deegan Expressway backed up to Yankee Stadium . A red Pinto was careering down the Gowanus Expressway , police in pursuit . Traffic was at a complete standstill on the Cross Island Parkway but moving pretty well down the L.I.E. , now that that construction work at Woodhaven Boulevard had ended . And we were sitting in a small room in a house in Brooklyn 's Park Slope section , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of accidents this afternoon , which might surprise you , since it 's a nice day outside , but it does n't surprise me , " Williams said . " A really cool , fine day like this , they feel great , they get in their cars , roll down the windows , and step on it . Maybe they turn on the radios real loud , listening to that rock and roll . We had that fog the other week , and everyone slowed down , paid attention , and we came through it fine . " Friendly and relaxed , Williams would be an easy man to talk to except for constant interruptions from a bank of radios and walkie-talkies surrounding him . Williams spends each rush hour monitoring all the Traffic Bureau radios , a police scanner , and the traffic reports of four different radio stations ; every half hour , he compiles the information and radios it in to the city 's traffic department headquar ters , and the people there use the data to dispatch agents and tow trucks . Williams will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached on his shortwave set and lighting his pipe and listening to his bank of radios all at once , with no apparent problem save for the pipe , which goes out two or three times a minute . Williams , who is blind and partly disabled , was the first radio operator that Traffic ever hired , more than twenty years ago . " There 's no way I can get in the had habit of goofing off , because control is depending on me . And that 's the ultimate  --  when someone needs you . The worst thing you can do to a conscientious worker is put him off by himself , because then he 'll work harder than ever , " Williams told us , adding , " The Grand Central Parkway is starting to back up , out by Shea Stadium . " When the commercial-radio traffic reports come on , Williams listens carefully , though he already knows most of what they are reporting ; it is the attentiveness of a critic . " He said nothing ; it was just a rehash " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He only gives one spot  --  his reports are too focussed , so you do n't get the broad picture , " he said of another . " We have our own standards in this business , " ' Williams said . " For the last few weeks , they 've been working on the Brooklyn Bridge , and sometimes that has stopped traffic all the way back to Staten Island . The first couple of days , we were calling it ' heavy , ' but then it became ' normal , ' and that 's what we 've been saying since . That 's what this business is about sometimes ? making normal out of a catastrophe . " Spinning and Mixing MUSIC LESSON FOR OUR TIME . Most recent dance records have been coming out as twelve-inch singles  --  the same size as L.P.s . They are priced in the penny-less pattern of $3.49 or $3.99 , which is meant to encourage the young and the broke , and they have been coming from between four and five hundred record companies in the United States , Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the popularity of a record is among the people who like to dance in discotheques . There are about a thousand discotheques in the metropolitan 42 MARCH 5,1984 area alone . The spinners of the records in the discotheques are the present-day disc jockeys  --  about twenty-five hundred of then in our area . The radio-station people who talk and play records are no longer called disc jockeys , or d.j.s ; they are now known in the music business as " airwave personalities . " The way most disc jockeys get their records is via record " pools , " of which there are about two dozen in the New York area . The record companies supply the pools with free records . Each pool has a roster of disc jockeys , who pay the pool a fee and pick up the new records from the pool once a week and inform the pool about how the records are doing with the dancers , and vice versa . We were brought up to date on all this information , and more , during a chat with Bobby Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Record Enterprises and usually called SURE . Davis , who has a delightfully hoarse voice and uses it with enormous patience , told us that he started SURE six years ago , when he was twenty-three . He is now ensconced , with his company , in an office over a beauty parlor at 1852 Westchester Avenue , in the Bronx , right next door to a discoth'eque called P.C. 's , which , he says , stands for Preferred Clientele but is open to one and all . " D.j.s are a whole new society of creative individuals , " Mr. Davis explained to us . " They are the guys who splice and play . They are the guys who create the club sound . ' They do not speak . They just use their talents . They work in the clubs , or in studios , or even at home , if they have two turntables , a mixer , headphones , amplifiers , and talent  --  your basic equipment . They are , you might say , custom mixers . They do n't just put the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they bring the sound up and down , they bring out the vocals or the instrumentals , they bring out the bass , they drop out instruments altogether , they play records backward  --  creative stuff like that . They also make tapes of their own mixes and give them to the radio stations . A professional d.j . is a guy who knows the old and is eager to know everything that 's new . In the clubs , he can take a crowd from the lowest point and make them scream and yell . He 's the one who gets them to bark . " In the background we could hear a solid , loud drumbeat , a lot of bass , and considerable high-spirited conversation , none of which seemed to distract Mr. Davis . " Before a d.j . reaches the expertise that enables him to elicit barks , he must research the good new hot records , " Mr. Davis said . " We are very selective about the new d.j.s we let into SURE , because we want to maintain very high standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept our membership limited to a hundred and twenty-five . They pay us fifty dollars a month each , for which they get the records and our research . We are now an established and valuable part of the music industry . D.j.s are allowed to belong to only one pool . That 's the unwritten rule . Our d.j.s are at the Cotton Club , in Harlem , and at the Silver Shadow , Laces Roller Skating , Club Zanzibar , the Roxy , the Roof Top , 2001 Odyssey , the Casbah , Valentine 's , Les Mouches , Empire Roller Disco , Chicago , Ozone Layer , Adam 's Apple , Peachtree , Melody Lounge , Streets , Skate City , Limelight , Players , Friends , Trixx , Crystal Lounge , Broadway International , Tantrum " We interrupted Mr. Davis to ask for a brief rundown on how SURE got started . " It was a way of bringing the new music  --  the street music  --  to the industry , " Mr. Davis replied . " We 're now used by all the big record companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put out mostly by the small , independent companies . They set the trends . They still put out the most creative records . A lot of the most popular dance records are put out by the independents . Companies like Prelude , West End , Emergency , Streetwise , Prism , Factory , Sugar Hill , Cutting , Tuff City . Time on the radio stations is still the most important key to a hit . But the cl.j.s , in the clubs are the ones who report the most danceable records to the pool , and they also give the airwave personalities their Aftrill% MA AO ' ) 1111.1t ' t k ' in a WI 02i z 4z , ir 111 . , NW " feedback . Now fifteen of our d.j.s are at clubs that have videos , so we 're getting into that , too . Finding new hot records is an important part of our work . We 're the trendsetters . Our d.j.s were behind Afrika Bambaataa 's rap record Planet Rock . ' SURE helped it get going . It made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was created because of the club d.j.s , you know . It 's an extended mix . Some d.j.s make the singles for the record companies , because the d.j.s are the ones who know how to get to the crowd . Some of their studio mixes , or re-mixes , are works of art . The d.j.s take the basic tapes , overdub them , drop out some instruments , but usually not the drums , keep the voice , and scratch  --  which means rotate the record backward to the beat with your finger . They can kick it , which means boost up the bass lines . People go crazy for that . Re-mix extends the playing time of a record . When dancers are getting into it , they do n't want it to end . Thanks to the d.j.s , the seven-inch single is now almost obsolete . I wo n't give up d.j.ing myself . Last night , I had a gig at a disco where they start at 3 A.M. Everybody goes there after they leave the other places . " Mr. Davis told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various artists . " I started half my life ago , when I was fifteen , as a mobile which is where you travel around with your own equipment that I already told you about , " Mr. Davis said . " I 'd work the weddings , the bar mitzvahs , all like that . It was cool . I 'd make four , five hundred dollars a night . But there was too much work to do , so I switched over to the clubs , which paid much less . At that time , I was under the influence of the Zulu Nation , Afrika Bambaataa 's youth movement , which Afrika Bambaataa led toward his love of music , and so a lot of us , thank God , got deflected from violence . Music soothes the savage beast , you know . Music brings us together . White people can come uptown now and go to Disco Fever , clubs like that , while our street music is accepted downtown . What we call our hit men visit the clubs regularly , and they report back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ? THE NEW YORKER five years , at Marco 's , now called Star-bucks , on Forty-fifth between Lexington and Third , and at Jo-Jo 's , in Westchester , still called Jo-jo 's . We arranged to accompany him while he checked on Les Mouches , on Eleventh Avenue at Twenty-sixth Street . Mr. Felicione , who has a full and bouncy head of light-brown hair combed straight back , met us wearing Jordache jeans and a silky-looking black jacket bearing designations in yellow letters which identified his purpose : S.U.R.E . Spinners Unlimited Record Enterprises The Music Force Home of the Professional D.J.s " My dedication is to the pool , " Mr. Felicione told us . " I have a professionalism about me . I can tell when a d.j . is trying to get a sound together  --  his creativity , his dedication to the sound . I report to the pool , but as a d.j . I also report to seven New York radio stations  --  all three disco channels , which are WKTU-FM 92.3 , WRKSFM 98.7 ( known as KISS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are WLIR , WPLJ , WNEW-FM , and WAPP  --  because the airwave personalities like to get feedback from many sources .

I 'm looking to hear not only what the d.j . is playing  --  whether it 's the Top Forty or progressive new stuff  --  but what format he is using , what his sound is , and then I 'm looking to see the nature of the crowd participation . " It was a little after midnight when we got to Les Mouches , on the fourth floor of a large loft building . ( Admission : ten dollars . ) The lights were going full force and the music was loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seemed to be going through obligatory , uncommitted gestures , without much energy . The resident d.j. , a happy-looking , gum-chewing young man named Eddie Diaz , who was wearing a lavender sweatshirt hearing the notation " Paradise Garage , " permitted a substitute to spin while he greeted Mr. Felicione ? and informed us that we had come too early . " People here do n't want to be first on the floor , " Mr. Diaz said . " They do n't want the others to think they have the keys to the club . In a little while , I 'll start spinning and mixing , working the lights , getting the crowd to dream , to see the colors . I 'll lift their mood . I 'll start them all harking . I 'll be orchestrating the whole night , flowing with the people . If I play something with a hundred and twenty beats a minute , I 'll go into something else with the same type of heat . Or I 'll play two records at the same time or back-spin it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different style , " Mr. Felicione said . " The Bronx is very hehop  --  street music , with a heavy , funky bass beat  --  which is good for electric boogie and break-dancing . They like a choppy sound . In Brooklyn , they go for the bebop sound , but basically they go for the Top Forty  --  commercial . In Queens , they want anything with a faster beat . But Manhattan wants the progressive city sound . They like the records before anybody hears them on the radio . " Mr. Diaz went to work , earphones on , behind his turntables , on a raised platform at one side of the dance floor . ? He worked the lights and spun and mixed a lot of records that Mr. Felicione told us were hot , both old and new ?
