 | In the front row , through the haze , he catches the eye of Mrs. Langhorn , the woman with the shingle hairdo , the head of the community board , the woman who introduced him just  --  what ? ? minutes ago . She purses her lips and cocks her head and starts shaking it . This look is supposed to say , " I wish I could help you , but what can I do ? Behold the wrath of the people !

" There 's a terrific commotion on one side of the stage . The TV lights are right in his face . A whole lot of pushing and shoving ? he sees a cameraman go down . Some of the bastards are heading for the stairs to the stage , and the television crews are in the way . So they 're going over them . Shoving  --  shoving somebody back down the stairs  --  his men , the plainclothes detail , the big one , Norrejo  --  Norrejo 's shoving somebody back down the stairs . Something hits the Mayor on the shoulder . It hurts like hell ! There on the floor  --  a jar of mayonnaise , an eight-ounce jar of Ilellman 's mayonnaise . Half full ! Half consumed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayonnaise at him ! In that instant the most insignificant thing takes over his mind . Who in the name of God would bring a half-eaten eight-ounce jar of Hellman 's mayonnaise to a public meeting ? The goddamned lights ! People are up on the stage . . . a lot of thrashing about . . . a regular melee . . . Norrejo grabs some big devil around the waist and sticks his leg behind him and throws him to the floor . The other two detectives , Holt and Danforth , have their backs to the Mayor . They 're crouched like blocking backs protecting a passer . Guliaggi is right beside him . " Get behind me , " says Guliaggi . " We 're going through that door . " Is he smiling ? Guliaggi seems to have this little smile on his face . He motions his head toward a door at the rear of the stage . He 's short , he has a small head , a low forehead , small narrow eyes , a flat nose , a wide mean mouth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Is that a smile ? It ca n't be , but maybe it is . This strange mean twist to his lips seems to be saying : " It 's been your show up to now , but now it 's mine . " Somehow the smile decides the issue . The Mayor gives up his Custer 's command post at the lectern . He gives himself over to this little rock . Now the others are closed in around him , too , Norrejo , Holt , Danforth . They 're around him like the four corners of a pen . People are all over the stage . Guliaggi and Norrejo are muscling their way through the mob . The Mayor is right on their heels . Snarling faces are all around him . There 's some character barely two feet from him who keeps jumping up and yelling , " You little white-haired pussy ! You little white-haired pussy ! " Every time the bastard jumps up , the Mayor can see his bulging ivory eyes and his enormous Adam 's apple . It 's the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He keeps saying it . " You little whitehaired pussy ! " Right in front of him  --  the big heckler himself ! The one with the elbows and the gold earring ! Guliaggi is between the Mayor and the heckler , but the heckler towers over Guliaggi . He must be six five . He screams at the Mayor , right in his face : " Go on back  --  ool " All at once the big son of a bitch is sinking , with his mouth open and his eyes bugged out . Guliaggi has driven his elbow and forearm into the man 's solar plexus . Guliaggi reaches the door and opens it . The Mayor follows . He feels  | the other detectives pushing him through from behind . He sprawls against Guliaggi 's back . The guy 's a piece of stone ! They 're going down a stairway . They 're clattering on some metal strips . He 's in one piece . The mob is n't even on his heels . He 's safe  --  his heart sinks . They 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch him . And in that moment . . . he knows . He knows even before his mind can put it all together . " I did the wrong thing . I gave in to that little smile . I panicked . I 've lost it all . "  | / At that very moment , in the very sort of Park Avenue co-op apartment that so obsessed the Mayor . . . twelve-foot ceilings .. . two wings , one for the white Anglo-Saxon Protestants who own the place and one for the help . . . Sherman McCoy was kneeling in his front hall trying to put a leash on a dachshund . The floor was a deep green marble , and it went on and on . It led to a five-foot-wide walnut staircase that swept up in a sumptuous curve to the floor above . It was the sort of apartment the mere thought of which ignites flames of greed and covetousness under people all over New York and , for that matter , all over the world . But Sherman burned only with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thirty minutes . So here he was , down on both knees , struggling with a dog . The dachshund , he figured , was his exit visa . Looking at Sherman McCoy , hunched over like that and dressed the way he was , in his checked shirt , khaki pants , and leather boating moccasins , you would have never guessed what an imposing figure he usually cut . Still young . . . thirty-eight years old . . . tall . . . almost sixone . terrific posture . . . terrific to the point of imperious . . . as imperious as his daddy , the Lion of Dunning Sponget . . . a full head of sandy-brown hair . . . a long nose . . . a prominent chin . . . He was proud of his chin . The McCoy chin ; the Lion had it , too . It was a manly st%in , a big round chin such as Yale men used to have in those drawings  | by Gibson and Leyendecker , an aristocratic chin , if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . 13ut at this moment his entire appearance was supposed to say : " I 'm only going out to walk the dog . " The dachshund seemed to know what was ahead . He kept ducking away from the leash . The beast 's stunted legs were deceiving . If you tried to lay hands on him , he turned into a two-foot tube packed with muscle . 1 n grappling with him , Sherman had to lunge . And when he lunged , his kneecap hit the marble floor , and the pain made him angry . " C'm on , Marshall , " he kept muttering . " Hold still , damn it . " The beast ducked again , and he hurt his knee again , and now he resented not only the beast but his wife , too . It was his wife 's delusions of a career as an interior decorator that had led to this ostentatious spread of marble in the first place . The tiny black grosgrain cap on the toe of a woman 's shoe-she was standing there . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing ? " Without looking up : " I 'm taking Marshall for a wa-a-a-a-a-alk . " Walk came out as a groan , because the dachshund attempted a fishtail maneuver and Sherman had to wrap his arm around the dog 's midsection . " Did you know it was raining ? " Still not looking up : " Yes , I know . " Finally he managed to snap the leash on the animal 's collar . " You 're certainly being nice to Marshall all of a sudden . " Wait a minute . Was this irony ? Did she suspect something ? He looked 11p . But the smile on her face was obviously genuine , altogether pleasant .. a lovely smile , in fact . . . Still a very good-looking woman , my wife . . . with her fine thin features , her big clear blue eyes , her rich brown hair . . . But she 's forty years old ! . . . No getting around it . Today good-looking . . . Tomorrow they 'll be talking about what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . But not mine , either ! " I have an idea , " she said . " Why do n't you let me walk Marshall ? Or Ill get Eddie to do it . You go upstairs and read Campbell a story before goes to sleep . She 'd love it . You 're not home this early very often . by do n't you do that ? " He stared at her . It was n't a trick ! She was sincere ! And yet zip zip zip zip zip zip with a few swift strokes , a few little sentences , she had . . . him in knots ! ? thongs of guilt and logic ! Without even trying !  | The fact that Campbell might be lying in her little bed  --  my only child ! ? the utter innocence of a six year-oldl  --  wishing that he would read her a bedtime story . . . while he was . . . doing whatever it was he was now doing . . . Guilt ! . . . The fact that he usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Guilt on top of guilt ! . . . He doted on Campbell ! ? loved her more than anything in the world ! . . . To make matters worse  --  the logic of it ! The sweet wifely face he was now staring at had just made a considerate and thoughtful suggestion , a logical suggestion . . . so logical he was speechless ! There were n't enough white lies in the world to get around such logic ! And she was only trying to be nice ! " Go ahead , " she said . " Campbell will be so pleased . I 'll tend to Marshall . " The world was upside down . What was he , a Master of the Universe , doing down here on the floor , reduced to ransacking his brain for white lies to circumvent the sweet logic of his wife ? The Masters of the Universe were a set of lurid , rapacious plastic dolls that his otherwise perfect daughter liked to play with . They looked like Norse gods who lifted weights , and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blutong . They were unusually vulgar , even for plastic toys . Yet one fine day , in a fit of euphoria , after he had picked up the telephone and taken an order for zero-coupon bonds that had brought him a $50,000 commission , just like that , this very phrase had bubbled up into his brain . On Wall Street he and a few others  --  how many ? ? three hundred , four hundred , five hundred ? ? had become precisely that . . . Masters of the Universe . There was . . . no limit whatsoever ! Naturally he had never so much as whispered this phrase to a living soul . He was no fool . Yet he could n't get it out of his head . And here was the Master of the Universe , on the floor with a dog , hog-tied by sweetness , guilt , and logic . . . Why could n't he ( being a Master of the Universe ) simply explain it to her ? Look , Judy , I still love you and I love our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and I do n't want to change any of it  --  it 's just that I , a Master of the Universe , a young man still in the season of the rising sap , deserve more from time to time , when the spirit moves me-but he knew he could never put any such thought into words . So resentment began to bubble up into his brain . . . In a way she brought it on herself , did n't she . . . Those women whose company she now seems to prize . . . those . . . those . . . The phrase pops into his head at that very instant : social X rays . . . They keep themselves so thin , they look like X-ray pictures . . . You can see lamplight through their b ? es . . . while they 're chattering about interiors and landscape  | gardening . . . and encasing their scrawny shanks in metallic Lycra tubular tights for their Sports Training classes . . . And it has n't helped any , has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck look . . . He concentrated on her face and neck . . . drawn . . . No doubt about it . . . Sports Training . . . turning into one of them He managed to manufacture just enough resentment to ignite the famous McCoy temper . He could feel his face grow hot . He put his head down and said , " Juuuuuudy . . . " It was a shout stifled by teeth . He pressed the thumb and the first two fingers of his left hand together and held them in front of his clamped jaws and blazing eyes , and he said : " Look . . . I 'm all  --  set  --  to  --  walk  --  the  --  dog . . . So I 'm  --  going ? out  --  to  --  walk  --  the  --  dog . . . Okay ? " Halfway through it , he knew it was totally out of proportion to . . . to . . . but he could n't hold back . That , after all , was the secret of the McCoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever . . . the imperious excess . Judy 's lips tightened . She shook her head . " Please do what you want , " she said tonelessly . Then she turned away and walked across the marble hall and ascended the sumptuous stairs . Still on his knees , he looked at her , but she did n't look back . Please do what you want . He had run right over her . Nothing to it . But it was a hollow victory . Another spasm of guilt The Master of the Universe stood up and managed to hold on to the leash and struggle into his raincoat . It was a worn but formidable rubberized British riding mac , full of flaps , straps , and buckles . He had bought it at Knoud on Madison Avenue . Once , he had considered its aged look as just the thing , after the fashion of the Boston Cracked Shoe look . Now he wondered . He yanked the dachshund along on the leash and went from the entry gallery out into the elevator vestibule and pushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irishmen from Queens and Puerto Ricans from the Bronx $200,000 a year to run the elevators , the apartment owners had decided two years ago to convert the elevators to automatic . Tonight that suited Sherman fine . In this outfit , with this squirming dog in tow , he did n't feel like standing in an elevator with an elevator man dressed up like an 1870 Austrian army colonel . The elevator descended  --  and came to a stop two floors below . Browning . The  | door opened , and the smooth jowled bulk of Pollard Browning stepped on . Browning looked Sherman and his country outfit and the dog up and down and said , without a trace of a smile , " Hello , Sherman . " " Hello , Sherman " was on the end of a ten-foot pole and in a mere four syllables conveyed the message : " You and your clothes and your animal are letting down our new mahogany-paneled elevator . " Sherman was furious but nevertheless found himself leaning over and picking the dog up off the floor . Browning was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a New York boy who had emerged from his mother 's loins as a fifty-year-old partner in Davis Polk and president of the Downtown Association . He was only forty but had looked fifty for the past twenty years . His hair was combed back smoothly over his round skull . He wore an immaculate navy suit , a white shirt , a shepherd 's check necktie , and no raincoat . He faced the elevator door , then turned his head , took another look at Sherman , said nothing , and turned back . 1 Sherman had known him ever since they were boys at the Buckley School . Browning had been a fat , hearty , overbearing junior snob who at the age of nine knew how to get across the astonishing news that McCoy was a hick name ( and a hick family ) , as in Hatfields and McCoys , whereas he , Browning , was a true Knickerbocker . He used to call Sherman " Sherman McCoy the Mountain Boy . " When the reached the ground floor , Browning said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . " Yes . " Browning looked at the dachshund and shook his head . " Sherman McCoy . Friend to man 's best friend . " Sherman felt his face getting hot again . He said , " That 's it ? " " What 's it ? " " You had from the eighth floor to here to think up something bright , and that 's it ? " It was supposed to sound like amiable sarcasm , but he knew his anger had slipped out around the edges . " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " said Browning , and he walked on ahead . The doorman smiled and nodded and held the door open for him . Browning walked out under the awning to his car . His chauffeur held the car door open for him . Not a drop of rain touched his glossy form , and he was off , smoothly , immaculately , into the swarm of &d; taillights heading down Park Avenue . No ratty riding mac encumbered the sleek fat back of Pollard Browning . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no wind , but the So  | dachshund was having none of it . He was beginning to struggle in Sherman 's arms . The power of the little bastard ! He put the dog down on the runner under the awning and then stepped out into the rain with the leash . In the darkness the apartment buildings on the other side of the avenue were a serene black wall holding back the city 's sky , which was a steaming purple . It glowed , as if inflamed by a fever . Hell , it was n't so bad out here . Sherman pulled , but the dog dug into the runner with his toenails . " Come on , Marshall . " The doorman was standing outside the door , watching him . " I do n't think he 's too happy about it , Mr. McCoy . " " I 'm not , either , Eddie . " And never mind the commentary , thought Sherman . " C'm on , c'm on , c'm on , Marhsall . " By now Sherman was out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the dachshund was n't budging . So he picked him up and took him off the rubber runner and set him down on the sidewalk . The dog tried to bolt for the door . Sherman could n't give him any more slack on the leash or else he was going to be right back where he started . So now he was leaning one way and the dog was leaning the other , with the leash taut between them . It was a tug-of-war between a man and a dog . . . on Park Avenue . Why the hell did n't the doorman get back in the building where he belonged ? Sherman gave the leash a real jerk . The dachshund skidded forward a li  --  w inches on the sidewalk . You could heard his toenails scraping . Well , maybe if he dragged him hard enough , he would give up and start walking just to keep from being dragged . " C'm on , Marshall ! We 're only going around the corner ! " He gave the leash another jerk and then kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward a couple of feet . He slid ! He would n't walk . He would n't give up . The beast 's center of gravity seemed to be at the middle of the earth . It was like trying to drag a sled with a pile of bricks on it . Christ , if he could only get around the corner . That was all he wanted . Why was it that the simplest things  --  he gave the leash another jerk and then he kept the pressure on . He was leaning like a sailor into the wind . He was getting hot inside his rubberized riding mac . The rain was running down his face . The dachshund had his feet splayed out on the sidewalk . His shoulder muscles were bulging . He was thrashing from side to side . His neck was stretched out . Thank God , he was n't barking , at least ! He slid . Christ , you could hear it ! You could hear his toenails scraping along the sidewalk . He would n't give an inch . Sherman had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this animal through the darkness and the rain on Park Avenue . He could feel the rain on the back of his neck . He squatted down and picked up the dachshund , catching a glimpse of Eddie , the doorman , as he did . Still watching ! The dog began bucking and thrashing . Sherman stumbled . He looked down . The leash had gotten wrapped around his legs . He began gimping along the sidewalk . Finally he made it around the corner to the pay telephone . He put the dog down on the sidewalk . Christ ! Almost got away ! He grabs the leash just in time . He 's sweating . His head is soaked with rain . His heart is pounding . He sticks one arm through the loop in the leash . The dog keeps struggling . The leash is wrapped around Sherman 's legs again . He picks up the telephone and cradles it between his shoulder and his ear and fishes around in his pocket for a quarter and drops it in the slot and dials . Three rings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was not Maria 's voice . He figured it must be her friend Germaine , the one she sublet the apartment from . So he said : " May I speak to Maria , please ? " The woman said : " Sherman ? Is that you ? " Christ ! It 's Judy ! He 's dialed his own apartment ! He 's aghast  --  para-lyzed ! " Sherman ? " He hangs up . Oh Jesus . What can he do ? He 'll bluff it out . When she asks him , he 'll say he does n't know what she 's talking about . After all , he said only five or six words . How can she be sure ? But it was no use . She 'd be sure , all right . Besides , he was no good at bluffing . She 'd see right through him . Still , what else could he do ? He stood there in the rain , in the dark , by the telephone . The water had worked its way down inside his shirt collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out how bad it was going to be . What would she do ? What would she say ? How angry would she be ? This time she 'd have something she could really work on . She deserved her scene if she wanted it . He had been truly stupid . How could he have done such a thing ? He berated himself . He was no longer angry at Judy at all . Could he bluff it out , or had he really done it now ? Had he really hurt her ? All at once Sherman was aware of a figure approaching him on the sidewalk , in the wet black shadows of the town houses and the trees . Even from fifty feet away , in the darkness , he could tell . It was that deep worry that lives in the base of the skull of every resident of Park Avenue  | south of Ninety-sixth Street  --  a black youth , tall , rangy , wearing white sneakers . Now he was forty feet away , thirty-five . Sherman stared at him . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my territory ! I 'm not giving way for any street punks ! The black youth suddenly made a ninety-degree turn and cut straight across the street to the sidewalk on the other side . The feeble yellow of a .44 xii um-vapor streetlight reflected for an instant on his face as he checked Sherman out . He had crossed over ! What a stroke of luck ! Not once did it dawn on Sherman McCoy that what the boy had seen was a thirty-eight-year-old white man , soaking wet , dressed in some sort of military-looking raincoat full of straps and buckles , holding a violently lurching animal in his arms , staring , bug-eyed , and talking to himself . Sherman stood by the telephone , breathing rapidly , almost panting . W hat was he to do now ? He felt so defeated , he might as well go back home . But if he went back immediately , it would be pretty obvious , would n't it ? He had n't gone out to walk the dog but to make a telephone call . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for it . He needed to think . He needed advice . He needed to get this intractable beast out of the rain . So he dug out another quarter and summoned up Maria 's number into his brain . He concentrated on it . He nailed it down . Then he dialed it wit It a plodding deliberation , as if he were using this particular invention , the telephone , for the first time . " hello ? " " Maria ? " " Yes ? " Faking no chances : " It 's me . " " Sherman ? " It came out Shuhhh-mun . Sherman was reassured . That was Maria , all right . She had the variety of Southern accent in which half Se vowels are pronounced like u 's and the other half like short i 's . Birds were buds , pens were pins , bombs were bums , and envelopes were inlamps . " Listen , " he said , " I 'll be right over . I 'm at a telephone booth . I 'm Sly a couple of blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to mean she was irritated . Finally : " W here on earth have you been ? " Where un uth have you bin ? Sherman laughed morosely . " Look , I 'll be right over . "  | The staircase of the town house sagged and groaned as Sherman walked up . On each floor a single bare 22-watt circular fluorescent tube , known as the Landlord 's Halo , radiated a feeble tubercular-blue glow upon the walls , which were Rental Unit Green . Sherman passed apartment doors with innumerable locks , one above the other in drunken columns . There were anti-pliers covers over the locks and anti jimmy irons over the jambs and anti-push-in screens over the door panels . In blithe moments , when King Priapus reigned , with no crises in his domain , Sherman made this climb up to Maria 's with a romantic relish . How bohemian ! How . . . real this place was ! How absolutely right for these moments when the Master of the Universe stripped away the longfaced proprieties of Park Avenue and Wall Street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one room , with its closet for a kitchen and another closet for a bathroom , this so-called apartment of hers , fourth floor rear , which she sublet from her friend Germaine  --  well , it was perfect . Germaine was something else again . Sherman had met her twice She was built like a fire hydrant . She had a ferocious hedge of hair on he upper lip , practically a mustache . Sherman was convinced she was : t lesbian . But so what ? It was all real ! Squalid ! New York ! A rush of fire in the loins ! But tonight Priapus did not rule . Tonight the grimness of the old brownstone weighed on the Master of the Universe . Only the dachshund was happy . He was hauling his belly up the stairs at a merry clip . It was warm and dry in here , and familiar . When Sherman reached Maria 's door , he was surprised to find himself out of breath . He was perspiring . His body was positively abloom be neath the riding mac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could knock on the door , it opened about a foot , and then she was . She did n't open it any farther . She stood there , looking Sherman up and down , as if she were angry . Her eyes gleamed above those r ? markable high cheekbones of hers . Her bobbed hair was like a black hood . Her lips were drawn up into an O. All at once she broke into ; i smile and began chuckling with little sniffs through her nose . " Well , come on , " said Sherman , " let me in ! Wait 'll I tell you what happened . " Now Maria pushed the door all the way open , but instead of ushering him inside , she leaned up against the doorjamb and crossed her legs and fC.Jed her arms underneath her breasts and kept staring at him and chuckling . She was wearing high-heeled pumps with a black-and-whin checkerboard pattern worked into the leather . Sherman knew little about  | shoe designs , but it registered on him that this one was of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , a good four inches above the knees , revealing her legs , which to Sherman 's eyes were like a dancer 's , and emphasizing her tiny waist . She wore a white silk blouse , open down to the top of her breasts . The light in the tiny entryway was such that it threw her entire ensemble into high relief : her dark hair , those cheekbones , the fine features of her face , the swollen curve of her lips , her creamy blouse , those creamy flan breasts , her shimmering shanks , so insouciantly crossed . " Sherman . . . " Shuhhh-mun . " You know what ? You 're cute . You 're just like my little brother . " The Master of the Universe was mildly annoyed , but he walked on in , passing her and saying : " Oh boy . Wait'lI I tell you what happened . " Without altering her pose in the doorway , Maria looked down at the dog , who was sniffing at the carpet . " Hello , Marshall ! " Muhshull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall . " " Wait 'll I tell you ? " Maria started to laugh and then shut the door . " Sherman . . . you kxok like somebody just . . . balled you up " ? she balled up an imaginary piece of paper ? " and threw you down . " " That 's what I feel like . Let me tell you what happened . " " Just like my little brother . Every day he came home from school , and khs belly button was showing . " Sherman looked down . It was true . His checked shirt was pulled out of bla pants , and his belly button was showing . He shoved the shirt back in , but he did n't take off the riding mac . He could n't settle in here . He Onuld n't stay too long . He did n't know quite how to get that across to Maria . " Every day my little brother got in a fight at school . . . " Sherman stopped listening . He was tired of Maria 's little brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he , Sherman , was childish , but because she insisted on going on about it . At first glance , Maria had lover struck Sherman as anybody 's idea of a Southern girl . She looked Malian or Greek . But she talked like a Southern girl . The chatter just poured out . She was still talking when Sherman said : " You know , I just called you from a telephone booth . You want to bAow what happened ? " Maria turned her back and walked out into the middle of the apartSent , then wheeled about and struck a pose , with her head cocked to one roe and her hands on her hips and one high-heeled foot stewed out in a  | carefree manner and her shoulders thrown back and her back slightly arched , pushing her breasts forward , and she said : " Do you see anything new ? " What the hell was she talking about ? Sherman was n't in a mood for anything new . But he looked her over dutifully . Did she have a new hairdo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded her with so much jewelry , who could keep track ? No , it must be something in the room . His eyes jumped around . It had probably been built as a child 's bedroom a hundred years ago . There was a little bay with three leaded casement windows and a window seat all the way around . He surveyed the furniture . . . the same old three bentwood chairs , the same old ungainly oak pedestal table , the same old mattress-and-box-spring set with a corduroy cover and three or four paisley cushions strewn on top in an attempt to make it look like a divan . The whole place shrieked : Make Do . In any event , it had n't changed . Sherman shook his head . " You really do n't ? " Maria motioned with her head in the direction of the bed . Sherman now noticed , over the bed , a small painting with a simple frame of blond wood . He took a couple of steps closer . It was a picture of a nude man , seen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way an eight-year-old might do it , assuming an eight-year-old had a notion to paint a nude man . The man appeared to be taking a shower , or at least there was what looked like a nozzle over his head , and some slapdash black lines were coming out of the nozzle . He seemed to be taking a shower in fuel oil . The man 's flesh was tan with sickly lavenderpink smears on it , as if he were a burn case . What a piece of garbage . . It was sick . . . But it gave off the sanctified odor of serious art , and so Sherman hesitated to be candid . " Where 'd you get that ? " " You like it ? You know his work ? " " Whose work ? " " Filippo Chirazzi . " " No , I do n't know his work . " She was smiling . " There was a whole article about him , in the Times . ot wanting to play the Wall Street philistine , Sherman resumed study of this masterpiece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can I say it ? . . . directness . " He fought the urge to be ironic . " Where did you get it ? " " Filippo gave it to me . " Very cheery .  | " That was generous . " " Arthur 's bought four of his paintings , great big ones . " " But he did n't give it to Arthur , he gave it to you . " " I wanted one for myself . The big ones are Arthur 's . Besides , Arthur would n't know Filippo from . . . from I do n't know what , if I had n't told him . " " Ah . " " You do n't like it , do you . " " I like it . To tell you the truth , I 'm rattled . I just did something so goddamned stupid . " Maria gave up her pose and sat down on the edge of the bed , the would-be divan , as if to say , " Okay , I 'm ready to listen . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thighs . Even though those legs , those exquisite shanks and flanks of hers , were beside the point right now , Sherman could n't keep his eyes off them . Her stockings made them shiny . They glistened . Every time she moved , the highlights shimmered . Sherman remained standing . He did n't have much time , as he was about to explain . " I took Marshall out for a walk . " Marshall was now stretched out on the rug . " And it 's raining . And he starts giving me a very hard time . " When he got to the part about the telephone call itself , he became highly agitated even in the description of it . He noticed that Maria was containing her concern , if any , quite successfully , but he could n't calm down . He plunged on into the emotional heart of the matter , the things he felt immediately after he hung up  --  and Maria cut him off with a shrug and a little flick in the air with the back of her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's nuthun , Shuhmun . He stared at her . " All you did was make a telephone call . I do n't know why you just did n't say , Oh , I 'm sorry . I was calling my friend Maria Ruskin . ' That 's what I woulda done . I never bother lying to Arthur . I do n't tell him every little thing , but I do n't lie to him . " Could he possibly have used such a brazen strategy ? He ran it through his mind . " Uhmmmmmmmm . " It ended up as a groan . " I do n't know how I can go out at 9:30 at night and say I 'm walking the dog and then call up and say , ' Oh , I 'm sorry , I 'm really out here calling Maria Ruskin . ' " " You know the difference between you and me , Sherman ? You feel sorry for your wife , and I do n't feel sorry for Arthur . Arthur 's gon na be seventy-two in August . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | me , and he knew he did n't like them , and he had his own friends , and he knew I did n't like them . I ca n't stand them . All those old Yids . . . Do n't look at me as if I 've said something awful ! That 's the way Arthur talks . ' The Yiddim . ' And the goyim , and I 'm a shiksa . I never heard of all that stuff before I met Arthur . I 'm the one who happens to be married to a Jew , not you , and I 've had to swallow enough of this Jewish business over the past five years to be able to use a little of it if I feel like it . " " Have you told him you have your own apartment here ? " " Of course not . I told you , I do n't lie to him , but I do n't tell him every little thing . " " Is this a little thing ? " " It 's not as big a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain in the neck . The landlord 's got himself in an uproar again . " Maria stood up and went to the table and picked up a sheet of paper and handed it to Sherman and returned to the edge of the bed . It was a letter from the law firm of Golan , Shander , Morgan , and Greenbaum to Ms. Germaine Boll concerning her status as the tenant of a rent-controlled apartment owned by Winter Real Properties , Inc . Sherman could n't concentrate on it . He did n't want to think about it . It was getting late . Maria kept going off on tangents . It was getting late . " I do n't know , Maria . This is something Germaine has to respond to . " " Sherman ? " She was smiling with her lips parted . She stood up . I " Sherman , come here . " He took a couple of steps toward her , but he resisted going very close . The look on her face said she had very close in mind . " You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've done is make a phone call . " " Hah . I do n't think I 'm in trouble , I know I 'm in trouble . " " Well , if you 're already in trouble , and you have n't even done anything , then you might as well do something , since it 's all the same differ11 Then she touched him . King Priapus , he who had been scared to death , now rose up from the dead . Sprawled on the bed , Sherman caught a glimpse of the dachshund . The beast had gotten uf , off the rug and had walked over to the bed and was looking up at them and switching his tail . Christ ! Was there by any chance some way a dog could indicate . . . Was there anything dogs did that showed they had seen . . . Judy knew  | about animals . She clucked and fussed over Marshall 's every mood , until it was revolting . Was there something dachshunds did after observing . . But then his nervous system began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty , the most ancient king , Priapus , Master of the Universe , had no conscience . Sherman let himself into the apartment and made a point of amplifying the usual cozy sounds . " Attaboy , Marshall , okay , okay . " He took off his riding mac with a lot of rustling of the rubberized material and clinking of the buckles and a few whews . No sign of Judy . The dining room , the living room , and a small library led off the marble entry gallery . Each had its familiar glints and glows of carved wood , cut glass , ecru silk shades , glazed lacquer , and the rest of the breathtakingly expensive touches of his wife , the aspiring decorator . When he noticed . The big leather wing chair that usually faced the doorway in the library was turned around . He could just see the top of Judy 's head , from behind . There was a lamp beside the chair . She appeared to be reading a book . He went to the doorway . " Well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were right . I got soaking wet , and Marshall was n't happy . " She did n't look around . There was just her voice , coming from out of the wing chair : " Sherman , if you want to talk to someone named Maria , why do you call me instead ? " Sherman took a step inside the room . " What do you mean ? If I want to talk to who ? " The voice : " Oh , for God 's sake . Please do n't bother lying . " " Lying  --  about what ? " Then Judy stuck her head around one side of the wing chair . The look she gave him ! With a sinking heart Sherman walked over to the chair . Within her corona of soft brown hair his wife 's face was pure agony . " What are you talking about , Judy ? " She was so upset she could n't get the words out at first . " I wish you could see the cheap look on your face . "  | " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrillness in his voice made her laugh . " All right , Sherman , you 're going to stand there and tell me you did n't call here and ask to speak to someone named Maria ? " " To who ? " " Some little hooker , if I had to guess , named Maria . " " Judy , I swear to God , I do n't know what you 're talking about ! I 've been out walking Marshall ! I do n't even know anybody named Maria ! Somebody called here asking for somebody named Maria ? " " Uhhh ! " It was a short , unbelieving groan . She stood up and looked at him square in the eyes . " You stand there ! You think I do n't know your voice on the phone ? " " Maybe you do , but you have n't heard it tonight . I swear to God . " " You 're lying ! " She gave him a hideous smile . " And you 're a rotten liar . And you 're a rotten person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cheap . You 're lying , are n't you ? " " I 'm not lying . I swear to God , I took Marshall for a walk , and I come back in here , and wham  --  I mean , I hardly know what to say , because I truly do n't know what you 're talking about . You 're asking me to prove a it negative proposition . " " Negative proposition . " Disgust dripped from the fancy phrase . " You were gone long enough . Did you go kiss her good night and tuck her in , too ? " " Judy ? " " Did you ? " Sherman rolled his head away from her blazing gaze and turned his palms upward and sighed . " Listen , Judy , you 're totally . . . totally . . . utterly wrong . I swear to God . " She stared at him . All at once there were tears in her eyes . " Oh , you swear to God . Oh , Sherman . " Now she was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na  --  I 'm going upstairs . There 's the telephone . Why do n't you call h ' - from here ? " She was forcing the words out through her tears . " I do n't care . I really do n't care . " Then she walked out of the room . He could hear her shoes clicking across the marble toward the staircase . Sherman went over to the desk and sat down in his Hepple-white swivel chair . He slumped back . His eyes lit on the frieze that ran around the ceiling of the little room . It was carved of Indian redwood , in high relief , in the form of figures hurrying along a city sidewalk . Judy had had  | It done in Hong Kong for an astonishing amount . . . of my money . ! ' hen he leaned forward . Goddamn her . Desperately he tried to relight. the tires of righteous indignation . His parents had been right , had n't they ? He deserved better . She was two years older than he was , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way she said it , meant it would matter , and had he listened ? Ohhhhh no . His father , %upposedly referring to Cowles Wilton , who had a short messy marriage to some obscure little Jewish girl , had said , " Is n't it just as easy to fall in love with a rich girl from a good family ? " And had he listened ? Ohhhhhh no . And all these years , Judy , as the daughter of a Midwestern history professor  --  a Midwestern history professor ! had acted as if she was an intellectual aristocrat  --  but she had n't minded using his money and his family to get in with this new social crowd of hers and start her decorating business and smear their names and their apartment across the pages of these vulgar publications , W and Architectural Digest and the rest of tiie-n , had she ? Ohhhhhhhhh no , not for a minute ! And what was he left with ? A forty-year-old bolting off to her Sports Training classes-and all at once , he sees her as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village at Hal Thorndike 's apartment with the chocolate-brown walls and the huge table covered with obelisks and the crowd that went considerably beyond bohemian , if he understood bohemian ? and the girl with the light brown hair and the fine , fine features and the wild short skimpy dress that revealed so much of her perfect little body . And all at once he feels the ineffable way they closed themselves up in the perfect cocoon , in his little apartment on Charles Street and her little apartment on West Nineteenth , immune to all that his parents and Buckley and St. Paul 's and Yale had ever imposed on him  --  and he remembers bow he told her  --  in practically these words ! that their love would tranIoend . . . everything-and now she , forty years old , starved and Sports Trained to nearperfection , goes crying off to bed . He slumped back in the swivel chair once more . Like many a man before him , he was no match , at last , for a woman 's tears . He hung his Woble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed a button on the desktop . The tambour or of a faux-Sheraton cabinet rolled back , revealing the screen of a television set . Another of his dear weeping decorator 's touches . He opened the desk drawer and took out the remote-control gadget and @ticked the set to life . The news . The Mayor of New York . A stage . An " ' wry crowd of black people . Harlem . A lot of thrashing about . A riot .  | The Mayor takes cover . Shouts . . . chaos . . . a real rhubarb . Absolutely pointless . To Sherman it had no more meaning than a gust of wind . He could n't concentrate on it . He clicked it off . She was right . The Master of the Universe was cheap , and he was rotten , and he was a liar .  | / The next morning , to Lawrence Kramer , she appears , from out of a feeble gray dawn , the girl with brown lipstick . She stands right beside him . He ca n't make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with brown lipstick . He ca n't make out any of the words , either , the words that tumble like tiny pearls from between those lips with brown lipstick , mnd yet he knows what she 's saying . Stay with me , Larry . Lie down with me . Larry . He wants to ! He wants to ! He wants nothing more in this world ! Then why does n't he ? What holds him back from pressing his lips won those lips with brown lipstick ? His wife , that 's what . His wife , his pile , his wife , his wife , his wife He woke up to the pitch and roll of his wife crawling down to the foot of the bed . What a flabby , clumsy spectacle . . . The problem was that Ole bed , a queen-size resting on a plywood platform , was nearly the width K the room . So you had to crawl down or otherwise traverse the length K the mattress to reach the floor . Now she was standing on the floor and bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way her flannel nightgown came down over her hips , 0e looked a mile wide . He immediately regretted thinking any such $ought . He tingled with sentiment . My Rhoda ! After all , she had given birth just three weeks ago . He was looking at the loins that had brought brth his first child . A son ! She did n't have her old shape back yet . He d to allow for that . Still , that did n't make the view any better .  | He watched her wiggle into the bathrobe . She turned toward the doori , ll way . A light came from the living room . No doubt the baby nurse , who was from England , Miss Efficiency , was already up and waxing efficient . In the light he could see his wife 's pale , puffy , undecorated face in profile . Only twenty-nine , and already she looked just like her mother . She was the same person all over again ! She was her mother ! No two ways about it ! It was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same freckles , the same chubby peasant nose and cheeks , even the beginning of her mother 's double chin . A yenta in embryo ! Little Gretel of the shtetl ! Young and yitzy on the Upper West Side ! He narrowed his eyelids to slits so that she would n't know he was awake . Then she left the room . He could hear her saying something to the baby nurse and to the baby . She had a way of saying " Jo-shu-a " in baby cadence . That was a name he was already beginning to regret . If you wanted a Jewish name , what was wrong with Daniel or David or Jonathan ? He pulled the covers back up over his shoulders . He would return to the sublime narcosis of sleep for another five or ten minutes . He would return to the girl with brown lipstick . He closed his eyes . . . It Ij , was no use . He could n't get her back . All he could think of was what the rush to the subway would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he got up . He walked down the mattress . It was like trying to walk I along the bottom of a rowboat , but he did n't want to crawl . So flabby and clumsy . . . He was wearing a T-shirt and B.V.D. shorts . He became aware that he had that common affliction of young men , a morning erection . He went to the chair and put on his old plaid bathrobe . Both he and his wife had started wearing bathrobes since the English baby nurse had come into their lives . One of the apartment 's many tragic flaws was that there was no way of getting from the bedroom to the bathroom without going through the living room , where the nurse slept on the convertible couch and the baby resided in a crib beneath a music-box mobile hung with tiny stuffed clowns . He could hear it now . The music box played the tune " Send in the Clowns . " It played it over and over again . Plink plink plinkplink , pl.ik plink plinkplink , plink PLINK plinkplink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trick . It looked as if there was a tent pole underneath it . But if he bent over , like this , it was n't noticeable . So he could walk through the living room and let the baby nurse see the tent pole , or he could walk through hunched over as if he had a back spasm . So he just stood where he was , in the gloom . The gloom was right . The presence of the baby nurse had made him  | and Rhoda acutely aware of what a dump they lived in . This entire apartment , known as a 31/2-room in New York real-estate parlance , had been created out of what had once been a pleasant but by no means huge bedroom on the third floor of a town house , with three windows overlooking the street . The so-called room he now stood in was really nothing more than a slot that had been created by inserting a plasterboard wall . The slot had one of the windows . What was left of the original room was now called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Back by the door to the hallway were two more slots , one for a kitchen two people could n't pass each other in , and the other for a bathroom . Neither had a window . The place was like one of those little ant colonies you can buy , but it cost them $888 a month , rent-stabilized . If it had n't been for the rent-stabilization law , it would have cost probably $1,500 , which would he out of the question . And they had been happy to find it ! My God , there were college graduates his age , thirty-two , all over New York who were dying to find an apartment like this , a 31/2 , with a view , in a town house , with high ceilings , rent-stabilized , in the West Seventies ! Truly pathetic , was n't it ? They could barely afford it when they were both working and their combined salaries had been $56,000 a year , $41,000 after deductions . The plan had been that Rhoda 's mother would give them the money as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four weeks , while Rhoda got back on her feet and went back to work . In the meantime , they would find an au pair girl to live in and look after the baby in return for room and board . Rhoda 's mother had come through with her part of the plan , but it was already obvious that this au pair girl who was willing to sleep on a convertible couch in the living room in an ant colony on the West Side did not exist . Rhoda would not be able to go back to work . They were going to have to get by on his $25,000-aftertaxes , and the yearly rent here in this dump , even with the help of rent stabilization , was $10,656 . Well , at least these morbid considerations had restored his bathrobe to a decent shape . So he emerged from the bedroom . " Good morning , Glenda , " he said . " Oh , good morning , Mr. Kramer , " said the baby nurse . Very cool and British , this voice of hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British accents or the Brits themselves . In fact , they intimidated him , the Brits and their accents . In the baby nurse 's oh , a mere oh , he detected a whiff of Finally getting up , are you ? A plump , fiftyish woman , she was already efficiently turned out in her white uniform . Her hair was pulled back into a perfect bun . She had  | already closed up the convertible couch and put the cushions back in place , so that it had resumed its daytime mode as a dingy yellow , synthetic-linen-covered piece of parlor furniture . She sat on the edge of the thing , her back perfectly straight , drinking a cup of tea . The baby was lying on his back in his crib , perfectly content . Perfectly was the woman 's middle name . They had found her through the Gough Agency , which an article in the Home section of the Times had listed as one of the best and most fashionable . So they were paying the fashionable price of $525 a week for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other places where she had worked . Always it was Park Avenue , Fifth Avenue , Sutton Place . . . Well , too bad ! Now you 're getting an eyeful of a jacklegged walkup on the West Side ! They called her Glenda . She called them Mr. Kramer and Mrs. Kramer , instead of Larry and Rhoda . Everything was upside down . Glenda was the very picture of gentility , having tea , while Mr. Kramer , lord of the ant colony , came tramping through to the bathroom barefooted , bare-legged , tousle-headed , wearing a tattered old plaid bathrobe . Over in the corner , under an extremely dusty Dracaena fragrans plant , the TV set was on . A commercial flared to an end , and some smiling heads began talking on the Today show . But the sound was not on . She would n't be so imperfect as to have the TV blaring . What on earth was she really thinking , this British arbiter sitting in judgment ( on an appalling fold-out sofa ) upon the squalor of chez Kramer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was just emerging from the bathroom , still in her bathrobe and slippers . " Larry , " she said , " look at my fuh-head . I think theh 's something theh , like a rash . I sawr it in the mirror . " Still foggy , Kramer tried to look at her fuh-head . " It 's nothing , Rhoda . It 's like the beginning of a pimple . " That was another thing . Since the baby nurse had arrived , Kramer had also become acutely aware of the way his wife talked . He had never noticed it before , or hardly . She was a graduate of Nr  --  v York University . For the past four years she had been an editor at Waverly Place Books . She was an intellectual , or at least she seemed to be reading a lot of the poetry of John Ashbery and Gary Snyder when he first met her , and she had a lot to say about South Africa and Nicaragua . Nevertheless , a forehead was a fuh-head , and there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was like her mother , too . Rhoda padded on by , and Kramer entered the bathroom slot . The bathroom was pure Tenement Life . There was laundry hanging all along the shower curtain rod . There was more laundry on a line that ran diago-  | flatly across the room , a baby 's zip-up suit , two baby bibs , some bikini panties , several pairs of panty hose , and God knew what else , none of it the baby nurse 's , of course . Kramer had to duck down to get to the toilet . A wet pair of panty hose slithered over his ear . It was revolting . There was a wet towel on the toilet seat . He looked around for some place to hang it . There was no place . He threw it on the floor . After urinating , he moved twelve or fourteen inches to the sink and took off his bathrobe and his T-shirt and draped them over the toilet seat . Kramer liked to survey his face and his build in the mornings . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his big neck , nobody ever took him for Jewish at first . He might be Greek , Slavic , Italian , even Irish  --  in any event , something tough . He was n't happy that he was balding on top , but in a way that made him look tough , too . He was balding the way a lot of professional football players were balding . And his build . . . But this morning he lost heart . Those powerful deltoids , those massive sloping trapezii , those tightly bunched pectorals , those curving slabs of meat , his biceps  --  they looked deflated . He was fucking atrophying ! He had n't been able to work out since the baby and the baby nurse arrived . He kept his weights in a carton behind the tub that held the dracaena plant , and he worked out between the plant and the couch  --  and there was no way in the world he could work out , could grunt and groan and strain and ventilate and take appreciative looks at himself in the mirror in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mythical au pair girl of the future , for that matter . . . Let 's face it ! It 's time to give up those childish dreams ! You 're an American workadaddy now ! Nothing more . When he left the bathroom , he found Rhoda sitting on the couch next to the English baby nurse , and both of them had their eyes pinned on the TV set , and the sound was up . It was the news segment of the Today %how . Rhoda looked up and said excitedly : " Look at this , Larry ! It 's the Mayor ! There was a riot in Harlem last night . Someone threw a bottle at him ! " Kramer only barely noticed that she said meh-uh for mayor and bohMhl for bottle . Astonishing things were happening on the screen . A stage - a melee  --  heaving bodies  --  and then a huge hand filled the screen and blotted out everything for an instant . More screams and grimaces and thrashing about , and then pure vertigo . To Kramer and Rhoda and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the screen and jumping onto the floor right beside little Joshua 's crib . And this was the fix/ay show , not the local news . This was what America was having for  | breakfast this morning , a snootful of the people of Harlem rising up in their righteous wrath and driving the white Mayor off the stage in a public hall . There goes the back of his head right there , burrowing for cover . Once he was the Mayor of New York City . Now he is the Mayor of White New York . When it was over , the three of them looked at one another , and Glenda , the English baby nurse , spoke up , with considerable agitation . " Well , I think that 's perfectly disgusting . The colored do n't know how good they 've got it in this country , I can tell you that much . In Britain there 's not so much as a colored in a police uniform , much less an important public official , the way they have here . Why , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two hundred coloreds who are mayors in this country . And they want to bash the Mayor of New York about . Some people do n't know how well off they are , if you ask me . " She shook her head angrily . Kramer and his wife looked at each other . He could tell she was thinking the same thing he was . Thank God in heaven ! What a relief ! They could let their breaths out now . Miss Efficiency was a bigot . These days the thing about bigotry was , it was undignified . It was a sign of Low Rent origins , of inferior social status , of poor taste . So they were the superiors of their English baby nurse , after all . What a fucking relief . The rain had just about stopped when Kramer started walking to the subway . He was wearing an old raincoat over his usual gray suit , buttondown shirt , and necktie . He had on a pair of Nike running shoes , white with stripes on the sides . He carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those slippery white plastic bags you get at the A &P.; The subway stop where he could catch the D train to the Bronx was at Eighty-first Street and Central Park West . He liked to walk across to Central Park West on Seventy-seventh Street and then walk up to EightyI first , because that took him past the Museum of Natural History . It was a beautiful block , the most beautiful block on the West Side , to Kramer 's way of thinking , like a street scene in Paris ; not that he had ever been to Paris . Seventy-seventh Street was very wide at that point . On one side was the museum , a marvelous Romanesque Revival creation in an old I : i reddish stone . It was set back in a little park with trees . Even on a cloudy day like this the young spring leaves seemed to glow . Verdant was the word that crossed his mind . On this side of the street , where he was  | walking , was a cliff of elegant apartment houses overlooking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marbled halls . And then he thought of the girl with brown lipstick . . . He could see her very clearly now , much more clearly than in the dream . He clenched his fist . Damn it ! He was going to do it ! He was going to call her . He was going to make that telephone call . He 'd have to wait until the end of the trial , of course . But he was going to do it . He was tired of watching other people lead . . . The Life . The girl with brown lipstick ! ? the two of them , looking into each other 's eyes across a table in one of those restaurants with blond wood and exposed brick and hanging plants and brass and etched glass and menus with crayfish Natchez and veal and plantains mesquite and cornbread with cayenne pepper ! Kramer had that vision comfortably in place when just up ahead , from the swell-looking doorway of 44 West Seventy-seventh Street emerged a figure that startled him . It was a young man , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , neatly combed back . He was wearing a covert-cloth Chesterfield topcoat with a golden brown velvet collar and carrying one of those burgundy leather attache cases that come from Madler or T. Anthony on Park Avenue and have a buttery smoothness that announces : " I cost $500 . " You could see part of the uniformed arm that held the door open for him . He was walking with brisk little steps under the canopy , across the sidewalk , toward an Audi sedan . There was a driver in the front seat . There was a number ? 271 ? in the rear side window ; a private car service . And now the doorman was hurrying out , and the young man paused to let him catch up and open the sedan 's rear door . And this young man was . . . Andy Heller ! No doubt about it whatsoever . He had been in Kramer 's class at Columbia Law School  --  and how superior Kramer had felt when Andy , chubby bright little Andy , had done the usual thing , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andy and hundreds like him would spend the next five or ten years humped over their desks checking commas , document citations , and block phrases to zip up and fortify the greed of mortgage brokers , health-and-beauty-aid manufacturers , merger-and-acquisition arbitragers , and re-insurance discounters  --  while he , Kramer , would embrace life and wade up to his hips into the lives of the miserable and the damned and stand up on his feet in the courtrooms and fight , mano a mono before the bar of justice . And that was the way it had , in fact , turned out . Why , then , did Kramer now hold back ? Why did n't he march right up and sing out , " Hi ,  | Andy " ? He was no more than twenty feet from his old classmate . Instead , he stopped and turned his head toward the front of the building and put his hand to his face , as if he had something in his eye . He was damned if he felt like having Andy Heller  --  while his doorman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for the signal to depart  --  he was damned if he felt like having Andy Heller look him in the face and say , " Larry Kramer , how you doing ! " and then , " What you doing ? " And he would have to say , " Well , I 'm an assistant district attorney up in the Bronx . " He would n't even have to add , " Making $36,600 a year . " That was common knowledge . All the while , Andy Heller would be scanning his dirty raincoat , his old gray suit , which was too short in the pants , his Nike sneakers , his A &P; shopping bag . . . Fuck that . . . Kramer stood there with his head turned , faking a piece of grit in his eye , until he heard the door of the Audi shut . It sounded like a safe closing . He turned around just in time to catch a nice fluffy little cloud of German-luxuryauto fumes in his face as Andy Heller departed for his office . Kramer did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably looked like . On the subway , the D train , heading for the Bronx , Kramer stood in the aisle holding on to a stainless-steel pole while the car bucked and lurched and screamed . On the plastic bench across from him sat a bony old man who seemed to be growing like a fungus out of a backdrop of graffiti . He was reading a newspaper . The headline on the newspaper said HARLEM MOB CHASES MAYOR . The words were so big , they took up the entire page . Up above , in smaller letters , it said " Go Back Down to Hymietown ! " The old man was wearing a pair of purple-and-whitestriped running sneakers . They looked weird on such an old man , but there was nothing really odd about them , not on the D train . Kramer scanned the floor . Half the people in the car were ( wearing sneakers with splashy designs on them and molded soles that looked like gravy boats . Young people were wearing them , old men were wearing them , mothers with children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , the children were wearing them . This was not for reasons of Young Fit &; Firm Chic , the way it was downtown , where you saw a lot of welldressed young white people going off to work in the morning wearing these sneakers . No , on the D train the reason was , they were cheap . On the D train these sneakers were like a sign around the neck reading SLUM Or EL BARRIO . Kramer resisted admitting to himself why he wore them . He let his  | eyes drift up . There were a few people looking at the tabloids with the headlines about the riot , but the D train to the Bronx was not a readers ' train . . . No . . . Whatever happened in Harlem would have exactly no effect in the Bronx . Everybody in the car was looking at the world with the usual stroked-out look , avoiding eye contact . Just then there was one of those drops in sound , one of those holes in the roar you get when a door opens between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , fifteen or sixteen years old , wearing big sneakers with enormous laces , untied but looped precisely in parallel lines , and black thermal jackets . Kramer braced and made a point of looking tough and bored . He tensed his sternocleidomastoid muscles to make his neck fan out like a wrestler 's . One on one . . . he could tear any one of them apart . . . But it was never one on one . . . He saw boys like this every day in court . . . Now the three of them were moving through the aisle . They walked with a pumping gait known as the Pimp Roll . He yaw the Pimp Roll in the courtroom every day , too . . . On warm days in the Bronx there were so many boys out strutting around with the Pimp atoll , whole streets seemed to be bobbing up and down . . . They drew closer , with the invariable cool blank look . . . Well , what could they possibly do ? . . . They passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing happened . . . Well , of course nothing happened . . . An ox , a stud like him . . . he 'd be the last person in the world they 'd choose to tangle with . . . Just the same , he was always glad when the train pulled into the 161st Street station . Kramer climbed the stairs and came out onto 161st Street . The sky was clearing . Before him , right there , rose the great bowl of Yankee Stadium . Beyond the stadium were the corroding hulks of the Bronx . Ten or fifteen years ago they had renovated the stadium . They had spent a hundred million dollars on it . That was supposed to lead to " the revitalIzation of the heart of the Bronx . " What a grim joke ! Since then , this precinct , the 44th , these very streets , had become the worst in the Bronx for crime . Kramer saw that every day , too . He started walking up the hill , up 161st Street , in his sneakers , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of these sad streets were standing outside the stores and short-order counters along 161st . Ile looked up  --  and for an instant he could see the old Bronx in all its ? , Iory . At the top of the hill , where 161st Street crossed the Grand Concourse , the sun had broken through and had lit up the limestone face of the Concourse Plaza Hotel . From this distance it could still pass for a  | European resort hotel from the 1920s . The Yankee ballplayers used to live there during the season , the ones who could afford it , the stars . He always pictured them living in big suites . Joe DiMaggio , Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig . . . Those were the only names he could remember , although his father used to talk about a lot more . 0 golden Jewish hills of long ago ! Up there at the top of the hill , 161st Street and the Grand Concourse had been the summit of the Jewish dream , of the new Canaan , the new Jewish borough of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up seventeen blocks from here , on 178th Street  --  and he had dreamed of nothing in this world more glorious than having an apartment . . . someday . in one of these grand buildings on the summit , on the Grand Concourse . They had created the Grand Concourse as the Park Avenue of the Bronx , except the new land of Canaan was going to do it better . The Concourse was wider than Park Avenue , and it had been more lushly landscaped  --  and there you had another grim joke . Did you want an apartment on the Concourse ? Today you could have your pick . The Grand Hotel of the Jewish dream was now a welfare hotel , and the Bronx , the Promised Land , was 70 percent black and Puerto Rican . The poor sad Jewish Bronx ! When he was twenty-two , just entering law school , Kramer had begun to think of his father as a little Jew who over the course of a lifetime had finally made the great Diasporic migration from the Bronx to Oceanside , Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trundled back and forth every day to a paper-carton warehouse in the West Twenties , in Manhattan , where he was " comptroller . " He , Kramer , would be the lawyer . . . the cosmopolitan . . . And now , ten years later , what had happened ? He was living in an ant colony that made the old man 's Tract Colonial three-bediuom in Oceanside look like San Simeon and taking the D train  --  the D train ! ? to work every day in . . . the Bronx ! Right before Kramer 's eyes the sun began to light up the other great building at the top of the hill , the building where he worked , the Bronx County Building . The building was a prodigious limestone parthenon done in the early thirties in the Civic Moderne style . It was nine stories high and covered three city blocks , from 161st Street to 158th Street . Such open-faced optimism they had , whoever dreamed up that building back then ! Despite everything , the courthouse stirred his soul . Its four great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were groups of classical figures at every corner . Agriculture , Commerce , Industry , Religion , and the Arts , Justice , Government , Law and Order , and  | the Rights of Man  --  noble Romans wearing togas in the Bronx ! Such a golden dream of an Apollonian future ! Today , if one of those lovely classical lads ever came down from up there , he would n't survive long enough to make it to 162nd Street to get a Choc-o-pop or a blue Shark . They 'd whack him out just to get his toga . It was no joke , this precinct , the 44th . On the 158th Street side the courthouse overlooked Franz Sigel Park , which from a sixth-floor window was a beautiful swath of English-style landscaping , a romance of trees , bushes , grass , and rock outcroppings that stretched down the south side of the hill . Practically nobody but him knew the name of Franz Sigel Park anymore , however , because nobody with half a brain in his head would ever go far enough into the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week some poor devil was stabbed to death at 10:00 a.m. on one of the concrete benches that had been placed in the park in 1971 in the campaign to " provide urban amenities to revitalize Franz Sigel Park and reclaim it for the community . " The bench was ten feet inside the park . Somebody killed the man for his portable radio , one of the big ones known in the District Attorney 's Office as Bronx attache cases . Nobody from the District Attorney 's Office went out into the park on a sunny day in May to have lunch , not even somebody who could benchpress two hundred pounds , the way he could . Not even a court officer , who had a uniform and legally carried a .38 , ever did such a thing . They stayed inside the building , this island fortress of the Power , of the white people , like himself , this Gibraltar in the poor sad Sargasso Sea of the Bronx . On the street he was about to cross , Walton Avenue , three orange-andblue Corrections Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building 's service bay . The vans brought prisoners from the Bronx House of Detention , Rikers Island , and the Bronx Criminal Court , a block away , for appearances at Bronx County Supreme Court , the court that handled serious felonies . The courtrooms were on the upper floors , and the prisoners were brought into the service bay . Elevators took them up to holding pens on the courtroom floors . You could n't see inside the vans , because their windows were covered by a heavy wire mesh . Kramer did n't have to look . Inside those vans would be the usual job lots of blacks and Latins , plus an occasional young Italian from the Arthur Avenue neighborhood and once in a while an Irish kid from up in Woodlawn or some stray who had the miserable luck to pick the Bronx to get in trouble in.  | " The chow , " Kramer said to himself . Anybody looking at him would have actually seen his lips move as he said it . In about forty-five seconds he would learn that somebody was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment it was nothing more than the usual , the blue-and-orange vans and him saying to himself , " The chow . " Kramer had reached that low point in the life of an assistant district attorney in the Bronx when he is assailed by Doubts . Every year forty thousand people , forty thousand incompetents , dimwits , alcoholics , psychopaths , knockabouts , good souls driven to some terrible terminal anger , and people who could only be described as stone evil , were arrested in the Bronx . Seven thousand of them were indicted and arraigned , and then they entered the maw of the criminal justice system  --  right here ? through the gateway into Gibraltar , where the vans were lined up . That was about 150 new cases , 150 more pumping hearts and morose glares , every week that the courts and the Bronx County District Attorney 's Office were open . And to what end ? The same stupid , dismal , pathetic , horrifying crimes were committed day in and day out , all the same . What was accomplished by assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all this relentless stirring of the muck ? The Bronx crumbled and decayed a little more , and a little more blood dried in the cracks . The Doubts ! One thing was accomplished for sure . The system was fed , and those vans brought in the chow . Fifty judges , thirty-five law clerks , 245 assistant district attorneys , one D.A. ? the thought of which made Kramer twist his lips in a smile , because no doubt Weiss was up there on the sixth floor right now screaming at Channel 4 or 7 or 2 or 5 about the television coverage he did n't get yesterday and wants today  --  and Christ k9ew how many criminal lawyers , Legal Aid lawyers , court reporters , court clerks , court officers , correction officers , probation officers , social workers , bail bondsmen , special investigators , case clerks , court psychiatrists  --  what a vast swarm had to be fed ! And every morning the chow came in , the chow and the Doubts . Kramer had just set foot on the street when a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with prodigious overhangs , front and back , the kind of twenty-foot frigate they stopped making about 1980 . It came screeching and nose-diving to a stop on the far corner . The Bonneville 's door , a gigantic expanse of molded sheet metal , about five feet wide , opened with a sad torque pop , and a judge named Myron Kovitsky 11 climbed out . He was about sixty , short , thin , bald , wiry , with a sharp 1 nose , hollow eyes , and a grim set to his mouth . Through the back win-  | dow of the Bonneville , Kramer could see a silhouette sliding over into the driver 's seat vacated by the judge . That would be his wife . The sound of the enormous old car door opening and the sight of this little figure getting out were depressing . The judge , Mike Kovitsky , comes to work in a greaser yacht practically ten years old . As a Supreme Court judge , he made $65,100 . Kramer knew the figures by heart . He had maybe $45,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper reaches of the legal profession , that was pathetic . Downtown . . . in the world of Andy Heller . . . they were paying people right out of law school that much to start . And this man whose car goes thwop every time he opens the door is at the top of the hierarchy here in the island fortress . Ile , Kramer , occupied some uncertain position in the middle . If he played his cards right and managed to ingratiate himself with the Bronx Democratic organization , this  --  thwop ! ? was the eminence to which he might aspire three decades from now . Kramer was halfway across the street when it began : " Yo ! Kramer ! " It was a huge voice . Kramer could n't tell where it was coming from . " You cocksucker ! " Whuh ? It stopped him in his tracks . A sensation  --  a sound  --  like rushing steam  --  filled his skull . " Hey , Kramer , you piece a shit ! " It was another voice . They " Yo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the van , the blue-and-orange van , the one closest to him , no more than thirty feet away . He could n't see them . He could n't make them out through the mesh over the windows . " Yo ! Kramer ! You Hymie asshole ! " Hymie ! How did they even know he was Jewish ! He did n't look ? Kramer was n't a  --  why would they  --  it rocked him ! 1 , " Yo ! Kramer ! You faggot ! Kiss my ass ! " " Aaayyyyyyy , maaaaan , you steeeck uppy yass ! You steeeck uppy yass ! " A Latin voice  --  the very barbarism of the pronunciation twisted the knife in a little farther . " Yo ! Shitface ! " " Aaaayyyyyy ! You keesa sol ! You keeeesa sol ! " " Yo ! Kramer ! Eatcho muvva ! " " Aaaaaaayy ! Maaaan ! Fokky you ! Fokky you ! "  | It was a chorus ! A rain of garbage ! A Rigoletto from the sewer , from the rancid gullet of the Bronx ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What should he do ? He stared at the van . He could n't make out a thing . Which ones ? . . . Which of them . . . from out of that endless procession of baleful blacks and Latins . . . But no ! Do n't look ! He looked away . Who was watching ? Did he just take this unbelievable abuse and keep walking to the Walton Avenue entrance , while they poured more of it all over him , or did he confront them ? . . . Confront them ? How ? . . . No ! He 'd pretend it was n't him they were yelling at . . . Who was to know the difference ! . . . He 'd keep walking up 161st Street and go around to the main entrance ! No one had to know it was him ! He scanned the sidewalk by the Walton Avenue entrance , which was close to the vans . . . Nothing but the usual poor sad citizens . . . They had stopped in their tracks . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The guard at the Walton Avenue entrance knew him ! The guard would know he was trying to get away and finesse the whole thing ! But the guard was n't there . . . He 'd probably ducked inside the doorway so he would n't have to do anything himself . Then Kramer saw Kovitsky . The judge was on the sidewalk about fifteen feet from the entrance . He was standing there , staring at the van . Then he looked right at Kramer . Shit ! He knows me ! He knows they 're yelling at me ! This little figure , who had just emerged  --  thwop ! ? from his Bonneville , stood between Kramer and his orderly retreat . " Yo ! Kramer ! You yellow shitbird ! " " Hey ! You bald-headed worm ! " " Aaaaaayyyy ! You steecka balda ed uppas sol ! Steeecka balda ed uppas sol ! " Bald ? Why bald ? He was n't bald . He was losing a little hair , you bastards , but he was a long way from being bald ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd spotted the judge , Kovitsly . Now they had two targets . " Yo ! Kramer ! What you got inna bag , man ? " " Hey , you bald-headed old fart ! " " You shiny of shitfa brains ! " " Gotcho balls inna bag , Kramer ? " They were in it together , him and Kovitsky . Now he could n't make his end run to the 161st Street entrance . So he kept walking across the street . He felt as if he were underwater . He cut a glance at Kovitsky . But Kovitsky was no longer looking at him . He was walking straight toward the van . His head was lowered . He was glaring . You could see the whites of his eyes . His pupils were like two death rays burning just beneath his  | upper eyelids . Kramer had seen him in court like this . . . with his head lowered and his eyes ablaze . The voices inside the van tried to drive him back . " What you looking at , you shriveled little pecker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wormdick ! " But the chorus was losing its rhythm . They did n't know what to make of this wiry little fury . Kovitsky walked right up to the van and tried to stare through the mesh . He put his hands on his hips . " Yeah ! What you think you looking at ? " " Sheeeeuh ! Gon ' give you something to look at , bro ' ! " But they were losing steam . Now Kovitsky walked to the front of the van . He turned those blazing eyes on the driver . " Do . . . you . . . hear . . . that ? " said the little judge , pointing toward the rear of the van . " Whuh ? " says the driver . " Whaddaya ? " He did n't know what to say . " Are you fucking deaf ? " said Kovitsky . " Your prisoners . . . your . prisoners . . . You 're an officer of the Department of Corrections . . . He started jabbing his finger toward the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You let your prisoners pull . . . this shit . . on the citizens of this community and on the officers of this court ? " The driver was a swarthy fat man , pudgy , around fifty , or some graylard middle age , a civil-service lifer . . . and all at once his eyes and his outh opened up , without a sound coming out , and he lifted his shoulrs , and he turned his palms up and the corners of his mouth down . It was the primordial shrug of the New York streets , the look that said , Egggh , whaddaya ? Whaddaya want from me ? " And in this specific stance : " Whaddaya want me to do , crawl back in that cage with that bt ? " It was the age-old New York cry for mercy , unanswerable and undeniable . Kovitsky stared at the man and shook his head the way you do when you 've just seen a hopeless case . Then he turned and walked back to the tear of the van . " Here come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Chew my willie , Yo ' Honor . " Kovitsky stared at the window , still trying to make out his enemy through the heavy mesh . Then he took a deep breath , and there was a  | tremendous snuffling sound in his nose and a deep rumbling in his chest and throat . It seemed incredible that such a volcanic sound could come from out of such a small thin body . And then he spit . He propelled a prodigious gob of spit toward the window of the van . It hit the wire mesh and hung there , a huge runny yellow oyster , part of which began to sag like some hideous virulent strand of gum or taffy with a glob on the bottom of it . And there it remained , gleaming in the sun for those inside , whoever they might be , to contemplate at their leisure . It stunned them . The whole chorus stopped . For one strange feverish I moment there was nothing in the world , in the solar system , in the universe , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oozing , 11 pendulous sunlit gob of spit . Then , keeping his right hand close to his chest so that no one on the sidewalk could see it , the judge shot them a finger and turned on his heels and walked toward the entrance to the building . He was halfway to the door before they got their breath back . " Yeggghhh , fuck you , too , man ! " " You wan na . . . sheeeeuh . . . you try that . . . But their hearts were n't in it anymore . The grisly esprit of the prisonvan uprising had fizzled in the face of this furious blazing little steel rod of a man . Kramer hurried after Kovitsky and caught up with him as he was going in the Walton Street entrance . He had to catch up with him . He had to show him that he was with him all along . It was the two of them ! out there taking that insidious abuse . The guard had reappeared at the door . " Gc d morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just another day at the island fortress of Gibraltar . Kovitsky barely looked at him . He was preoccupied . His head was down . Kramer touched his shoulder . " Hey , Judge , you 're too much ! " Kramer beamed , as if the two of them had just been through a great battle , shoulder to shoulder . " They shut up ! I could n't believe it ! They shut up ! " Kovitsky stopped and looked Kramer up and down , as if looking at someone he had never seen before . " Fucking useless , " said the judge . He 's blaming me for doing nothing , for not helping him  --  but in the next instant Kramer realized that Kovitsky was in fact talking about the E driver of the van .  | " Well , the poor sonofabitch , " said Kovitsky , " he 's terrified . I 'd be ashamed to have a job like that if I was that fucking terrified . " Ile seemed to be talking more to himself than to Kramer . He kept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The profanity scarcely even registered on Kramer . The courthouse was like the army . From the judges on down to the guards there was one all-purpose adjective or participle or whatever it should be called , and after a while it was as natural as breathing . No , Kramer 's mind was racing ahead . He was afraid the next words out of Kovitsky 's mouth were going to be " Why did you just fucking stand there , doing nothing ? " He was already inventing excuses . " I could n't tell where it was coming from . . . I did n't know if it was from the van or . .. " The fluorescent lighting gave the hallway the dim toxic haze of an X-ray clinic . " . . . this Hymie business , " Kovitsky was saying . Then he gave Kramer a look that clearly required a response . Kramer did n't know what the hell he had been talking about . " Hymie ? " " Yeah , Here comes Hymie , ' " said Kovitsky . " Wormdick . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed , genuinely amused by the thought . " Wormdick ' . . . But Hymie . ' That 's fucking poison . That 's hate ! That 's anti-Semitic . And for what ? Without the Yiddishe , they 'd still be laying asphalt and looking up shotgun barrels in South Carolina , is what the fuck they 'd be doing , the poor bastards . " An alarm went off . A frantic ring filled the hall . It pounded Kramer 's ears in waves . Judge Kovitsky had to raise his voice to be heard , but he did n't even look around . Kramer did n't bat an eye . The alarm meant a : prisoner had escaped or some skinny little thug 's brother had pulled out revolver in a courtroom , or some gargantuan tenant had grabbed a 130-pound hearing officer in a hammerlock . Or maybe it was only a fire . The first few times Kramer heard the alarm on the island fortress of Gibraltar , his eyes jumped around and he braced himself for the clatter of a herd of guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marble floors trying to catch some nutball in superpraphic sneakers who , jacked up by fear , does the hundred in 8.4 . But after a while he ignored it . It was the normal state of red alert , panic , and disarray in the Bronx County Building . All around Kramer and the judge , people were swiveling their heads in every direction . Such sad faces . . . They were entering Gibraltar for the first time , on Christ knows what sad missions .  | All at once Kovitsky was motioning toward the floor and saying , . . is this , Kramer ? " " This ? " said Kramer , desperately trying to figure out what the judge was talking about . " These fucking shoes , " said Kovitsky . " Ah ! Shoes , " said Kramer . " They 're running shoes , Judge . " " Is that something Weiss thought up ? " " N0000 , " said Kramer , chuckling as if moved by the judge 's wit . " Jogging for Justice ? Is that what Abe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no , no , no . " More chuckles and a big grin , since Kovitsky obviously loved this line , jogging for Justice . " Christ , every kid who sticks up a Red Apple 's in my courtroom wearing these goddamned things , and now you guys ? " " N000-ho-ho . " " You think you 're gon na come in my part looking like this ? " " N0000000-ho-ho-ho ! Would n't think of it , Judge . " The alarm kept ringing . The new people , the new sad faces who had never been inside this citadel before , looked all about with their eyes wide and their mouths open , and they saw a bald-headed old white man in a gray suit and a white shirt and a necktie and a balding young white man in a gray suit and a white shirt and a necktie just standing there talking , smiling , yakking , shooting the breeze , and so if these two white people , so obviously a part of the Power , were just standing there , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be ? As the alarm rang in his head , Kramer grew still more depressed . Right then and there he made up his mind . ire was going to do something  --  something startling , something rash , something desperate , whatever it took . He was going to break out of here . He was going to rise up from this muck . He was going to light up the sky , seize The Life for himself He could see the girl with brown lipstick again , just as surely as if she was standing right next to him in this sad grim place . rt  | / Sherman McCoy walked out of his apartment building holding his daughter Campbell 's hand . Misty days like this created a peculiar ashy-blue light on Park Avenue . But once they stepped out from under the awning over the entrance . . . such radiance ! The median strip on Park was a swath of yellow tulips . There were thousands of them , thanks to the dues apartment owners like Sherman paid to the Park Avenue Association and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Wiltshire Country Gardens , run by three Koreans from Maspeth , Long Island . There was something heavenly about the yellow glow of all the tulips . That was appropriate . So long as Sherman held his daughter 's hand in his and walked her to her bus stop , he felt himself a part of God 's grace . A sublime state , it was , and it did n't cost much . The bus stop was only across the street . There was scarcely a chance for his impatience over Campbell 's tiny step to spoil this refreshing nip of fatherhood he took each morning . Campbell was in the first grade at Taliaferro , which , as everybody , tout le monde , knew , was pronounced Toliver . Each morning the Taliaferro school dispatched its own bus , bus driver , - and children 's chaperone up Park Avenue . Few , indeed , were the girls at Taliaferro who did not live within walking distance of that bus route . To Sherman , as he headed out onto the sidewalk holding Campbell 's hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each morning . Her hair was a luxuriance of soft waves like her mother 's , but lighter and more  | course . He had hoped he would never have to discuss religion with her . I'hey had begun sending her to Sunday school at St. James ' Episcopal ( ' church , at Madison and Seventy-first . That was the way you took care of religion . You enrolled them at St. James ' , and you avoided talking or thinking about religion again . " Oh , " said Campbell . She stared out into the distance . Sherman felt guilty . She had brought up a difficult question , and he had ducked it . And here she was , at the age of six , trying to piece together the greatest puzzle of life . " Daddy ? " " Yes , darling ? " He held his breath . " You know Mrs. Winston 's bicycle ? " Mrs. Winston 's bicycle ? Then he remembered . Two years ago , at Campbell 's nursery school , there had been a teacher named Mrs. Winston who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . All the children had thought this was wonderful , a teacher who rode a bicycle to school . He had never heard Campbell mention the woman since then . " Oh yes , I remember . " An anxious pause . " MacKenzie has one just like it . " MacKenzie ? MacKenzie Reed was a little girl in Campbell 's class . " She does ? " " Yes . Only it 's smaller . " Sherman waited . . . for the leap of logic . . . but it never came . That was it . God lives ! God is dead ! Mrs. Winston 's bicycle ! No way , Jose ! N 0 , Sejo ! They all came out of the same heap in the toy box . 1 ' ' Sherman was relieved for a moment , but then he felt cheated . The thought that his daughter might actually have questioned the existence of ( lod at the age of six  --  this he had taken as a sign of superior intelligence . Over the past ten years , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become socially correct for girls . Several little girls in burgundy jumpers , and their parents or nannies , were assembled at the Taliaferro bus stop , on the other side of Park Avenue . As soon as Campbell saw them , she tried to remove her hand from Sherman 's . She had reached that age . But he would n't let her . He held her hand tightly and led her across the street . He was her protector . Ile glowered at a taxi as it came to a noisy stop at the light . He would gladly throw himself in front of it , if that was what it would take to save Campbell 's life . As they crossed Park Avenue , he had a mental picture of what an ideal pair they made . Campbell , the perfect angel in a privateschool uniform ; himself , with his noble head , his Yale chin , his big frame ,  | and his $1,800 British suit , the angel 's father , a man of parts ; he visualized the admiring stares , the envious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and all . As soon as they reached the bus stop , Campbell pulled free . The parents who brought their girls to the Taliaferro bus stop in the morning were a cheery bunch . What a chipper mood they were always in ! Sherman began saying his good mornings . Edith Tompkins , John Channing , MacKenzie Reed 's mother , Kirby Coleman 's nanny , Leonard Schorske , Mrs. Lueger . When he got to Mrs. Lueger  --  he had never known her first ; 1 name  --  he did a double take . She was a thin pale blond woman who never wore makeup . This morning she must have rushed down to the bus stop with her daughter at the last minute . She was wearing a man 's blue 11 button-down shirt with the top two buttons unbuttoned . She had on a pair of old blue jeans and some ballet slippers . The jeans were very tight . She had a terrific little body . He had never noticed that before . Really quite terrific ! She looked so . . . pale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cup of coffee , Mrs. Lueger . Come on , I 'm going over to that coffee shop on Lexington . Oh , that 's silly , Mr. McCoy . Come on up to the apartment . I have some coffee already made . He stared at her for a good two seconds longer than he should have , and then . . . pop . . . the bus arrived , a big solid Greyhound-size vehicle , and the children bounded up the steps . Sherman turned away , then looked back at Mrs. Lueger . But she was n't looking at him . She was walking toward he , apartment building . The back seam of her jeans practically clove her in two . There were whitish spots on either side of the seat . They were like highlights for the flesh that welled up underneath . What a marvelous bottom she had ! And he had always thought of these women as moms . Who knew what hot little fires burned within these moms ? I Sherman started walking east , toward the taxi stand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just why , he could n't have explained . The discovery of the lovely little Mrs. Lueger . . . yes , but in fact he always left the bus stop in a good mood . The Best School , the Best Girls , the Best Families , the Best Section of the capital of the Western world in the late twentieth century  --  but the only part that stuck in his mind was the sensation of Campbell 's little hand holding his . That was why he felt so good . The touch of her trusting , utterly dependent little hand was life itself ! Then his spirits sank . He was walking along at a good clip , his eyes idly panning the facades of the brownstone houses . On this gray morning  | they looked old and depressing . Shapeless polyethylene bags of trash , in shades of Dogshit Brown and Turd Green , were deposited in front of them , out by the curbs . The bags had a slimy-looking surface . How could people live this way ? Just two blocks away was Maria 's apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Sherman and Rawlie had gone to Buckley , St. Paul 's , and Yale together , and now they both worked at Pierce &; Pierce . Rawlie had moved from a sixteen-room apartment on Fifth Avenue to the top two floors of a brownstone somewhere along here after his divorce . Very depressing . Sherman had taken a nice big step toward a divorce last night , had n't he ? Not only had Judy caught him , in flagrante telephone , as it were , but then he , abject creature of lust that he was , had gone ahead and gotten laid  --  right ! nothing more than that ! ? laid ! and not returned home for forty-five minutes . . . What would it do to Campbell if he and Judy ever broke up ? He could n't I imagine his life after such a thing . Weekend visitation rights with his own daughter ? What was that phrase they used ? " Quality time " ? So tawdry , so tawdry . . . Campbell 's soul hardening , month by month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he had gone half a block , he hated himself . He felt like fawning around and heading back to the apartment and begging forgive ? and swearing never again . He felt like it , but he knew he would n't do . That would make him late getting to the office , which was much wned upon at Pierce &; Pierce . No one ever said anything openly , but ' nu were supposed to get there early and start making money . . . and raster the universe . A surge of adrenaline  --  the Giscard ! He was closing on the biggest deal of his life , the Giscard , the gold-backed bond titer of the Universe ! ? then he sank again . Judy had slept on the ybed in the dressing room of their bedroom suite . She was still asleep , pretending to be , when he got up . Well , thank God for that . He had n't hed another round with her this morning , especially with Campbell Bonita listening in . Bonita was one of those South American servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To display limper or anguish in front of her would be a gaffe . No wonder marriages red to hold up better . Sherman 's parents and their friends had all had ty of servants , and the servants had worked long hours and lived in. you were unwilling to argue in front of the servants , then there was n't Ouch opportunity to argue at all . So in the best McCoy manner , just as his father would have done it ? pt that he could n't imagine his father ever being in such a jamrman had kept up appearances . He had breakfast in the kitchen with  | Campbell , while Bonita got her through breakfast and ready for school . Bonita had a portable television set in the kitchen , and she kept turning toward it to watch the news report of the riot in Harlem . It was hot stuff . but Sherman had n't paid attention to it . It had all seemed so remote . . the sort of thing that happened out there . . . among those people . . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bonita and Campbell would n't sense the poisonous atmosphere that en veloped the household . By now Sherman had walked as far as Lexington Avenue . He always stopped at a candy store near the corner and bought the Times . As he turned the corner , a girl was heading toward him , a tall girl with a lot of blond hair . A large handbag hung from her shoulder by a strap . She was walking rapidly , as if heading for the subway at Seventy-seventh Street She had on a long sweater that was wide open down the front , revealing ; t polo shirt with a little embroidered emblem over the left breast . She won some sort of go-to-hell white pants that were very loose and floppy in the legs but exceptionally tight in the crotch . Exceptionally ! There was an astonishing crevice . Sherman stared and then looked at her face . She stared right back . She looked him right in the eye and smiled . She did n't slow down or give him a provocative look . It was a confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi ! We 're a couple of good-looking animals . are n't we ! " So frank ! So unabashed ! So eagerly immodest ! In the candy store , after paying for the Times , Sherr . In turned to go out the door and his eyes swept across a magazine rack . The salmon flesh jumped out at him . . . girls . . . boys . . . girls with girls . . . boys with boys . . . girls with boys . . . girls with bare breasts , girls with bare bottoms . . . girls with paraphernalia . . . a happy grinning riot of pornography , a rout , an orgy , a hog wallow . . . On the cover of one magazine is a girl wearing only a pair of high-heeled shoes and a loin cloth . . . Except that it is n't a loincloth , it 's a snake . . . Somehmy it 's wedged in her groin and looking right at Sherman . . . She 's looking right at him , too . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginable . . . It 's the face of the girl who serves you a chocolate-chip ice-cream cone at the Baskin-Robbins . . . Sherman resumed his walk toward First Avenue in a state of agitation It was in the air ! It was a wave ! Everywhere ! Inescapable ! . . . Sex ! . . There for the taking ! . . . It walked down the street , as bold as you please ! . . . It was splashed all over the shops ! If you were a young man and halfway alive , what chance did you have ? . . . Technically , he had been unfaithful to his wife . Well , sure . . . but who could remain nit t  | liogamous with this , this , this tidal wave of concupiscence rolling across the world ? Christ almighty ! A Master of the Universe could n't be a saint , aRer all . . . It was unavoidable . For Christ 's sake , you ca n't dodge sowflakes , and this was a blizzard ! He had merely been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught at it . It meant nothing . It had no moral dimension . It was nothing more than getting soaking wet . By the time he reached the cabstand at First and Seventy-ninth , he had just about worked it out in his mind . At Seventy-ninth Street and First Avenue the taxis lined up every day take the young Masters of the Universe down to Wall Street . Accordto the regulations , every cabdriver was supposed to take you anyere you wanted to go , but the drivers in the line at Seventy-ninth and t would n't budge unless you were going down to Wall Street or close it . From the cabstand they swung two blocks east and then went down along the East River on the highway , the FDR , the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive . It was a ten-dollar ride each morning , but what was that to a Master of the Universe ? Sherman 's father had always taken the subway to Wall Street , even when he was the chief executive officer of Dunning Sponget ? Leach . Even now , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursions to Dunning Sponget to breathe the same air as his lawyer ironies for three or four hours , he went by subway . It was a matter of nciple . The more grim the subways became , the more graffiti those ple scrawled on the cars , the more gold chains they snatched off girls ' ks , the more old men they mugged , the more women they pushed in t of the trains , the more determined was John Campbell McCoy that were n't going to drive him off the New York City subways . But to new breed , the young breed , the masterful breed , Sherman 's breed , e was no such principle . Insulation ! That was the ticket . That was the Rawlie Thorpe used . " If you want to live in New York , " he once Sherman , " you 've got to insulate , insulate , insulate , " meaning insuyourself from those people . The cynicism and smugness of the idea el Sherman as very au courant . If you could go breezing down the R Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the urban wars ? The driver was . . . a Turk ? An Armenian ? Sherman tried to make ? I his name on the card in the frame on the dashboard . Once the taxi shed the drive , he settled back to read the Times . There was a picture w the front page of a mob of people on a stage and the Mayor standing Sir a podium , staring at them . The riot , no doubt . He began to read the  | story , but his mind wandered . The sun was beginning to break through the clouds . He could see it on the river , off to his left . At this moment the poor filthy river sparkled . It was a sunny day in May , after all . Up ahead , the towers of New York Hospital rose straight up from the edge of the highway . There was a sign for the East Seventy-first Street exit , the one his father had always taken when they drove back from Southampton on Sunday evenings . The very sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , not so much think of as feel the house on Seventythird Street with its Knickerbocker-green rooms . He had grown up in those pale grayish-green rooms and trudged up and down those four flights of narrow stairs believing that he was living in the height of elegance in the household of the mighty John Campbell McCoy , the Lion o ! ' Dunning Sponget &; Leach . Only recently had it dawned on him that back in 1948 , when his parents had bought and renovated that house , they had been a mildly adventurous young couple , tackling what at the time was an old wreck in a down-at-the-heels block , keeping a stern eye on costs every step of the way , and taking pride in what a proper house they had created for a relatively modest amount . Christ ! If his father ever found out how much he had paid for his apartment and how he had financed it , he 'd have a stroke ! Two million six hundred thousand dollars , with $1,800,000 of it borrowed . . . $21,000 a month in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years . . The Lion of Dunning Sponget would be appalled . . . and worse than appalled , wounded . . . wounded at the thought of how his endlessk repeated lessons concerning duty , debt , ostentation , and proportion had whistled straight through his son 's skull . . . Had his father ever played around ? It was n't out of the question . 1lr was a handsome man . He had the Chin . Yet Sherman could n't imagine if And by the time he saw the Brooklyn Bridge up ahead , he stopped trying to . In a few minutes he would be on Wall Street . The investment-banking firm of Pierce &; Pierce occupied the fiftiet fifty-first , fifty-second , fifty-third , and fifty-fourth floors of a glass tow that rose up sixty stories from out of the gloomy groin of Wall Street . Tl bond trading room , where Sherman worked , was on the fiftieth . Eve day he stepped out of an aluminum-walled elevator into what looked lik the reception area of one of those new London hotels catering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace and an antique maho any mantelpiece with great bunches of fruit carved on each corner . 0 in front of the fake fireplace was a brass fence or fender , as they called  | in country homes in the west of England . In the appropriate months a fake fire glowed within , casting flickering lights upon a prodigious pair of brass andirons . The wall surrounding it was covered in more mahogany , rich and reddish , done in linen-fold panels carved so deep , you could feel the expense in the tips of your fingers by just looking at them . All of this reflected the passion of Pierce &; Pierce 's chief executive officer , Eugene Lopwitz , for things British . Things British  --  library ladders , bow-front consoles , Sheraton legs , Chippendale backs , cigar cutters , tufted club chairs , Wilton-weave carpet  --  were multiplying on the fiftieth floor at Pierce &; Pierce day by day . Alas , there was n't much Eugene Lopwitz could do about the ceiling , which was barely eight feet above the floor . The floor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wires to electrify Guatemala . The wires provided the power for the computer terminals and telephones of the bond trading room . The ceiling had been lowered one foot , to make room for light housings and airconditioning ducts and a few more miles of wire . The floor had risen ; the ceiling had descended ; it was as if you were in an English mansion that had been squashed . No sooner did you pass the fake fireplace than you heard an ungodly roar , like the roar of a mob . It came from somewhere around the corner . You could n't miss it . Sherman McCoy headed straight for it , with relish . On this particular morning , as on every morning , it resonated with his very gizzard . He turned the corner , and there it was : the bond trading room of Pierce &; Pierce . It was a vast space , perhaps sixty by eighty feet , but with the same eight-foot ceiling bearing down on your head . It was an oppressive space with a ferocious glare , writhing silhouettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of plate glass that faced south , looking out over New York Harbor , the Statue of Liberty , Staten Island , and the Brooklyn and New Jersey shores . The writhing silhouettes were the arms and torsos of young men , few of them older than forty . They had their suit jackets off . They were moving about in an agitated manner and sweating early in the morning and shouting , which created the roar . It was the sound of well-educated young white men baying for money on the bond market . " Pick up the fucking phone , please ! " a chubby , pink-faced member of the Harvard Class of 1976 screamed at someone two rows of desks away . The room was like a newspaper city room in that there were no partitions and no signs of visible rank . Everyone sat at light gray metal desks in  | front of veal-colored computer terminals with black screens . Rows of green-diode letters and numbers came skidding across . " I said please pick up the fucking phone ! I mean holy shit ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the day had just begun . A member of the Yale Class of 1973 with a neck that seemed to protrude twelve inches out of his shirt stared at a screen and screamed over the telephone at a broker in Paris : " If you ca n't see the fucking screen . . . Oh , for Christ 's sake , Jean-Pierre , that 's the buyer 's five million ! The buyer 's ! Nothing further 's coming in ! " Then he covered the telephone with his hand and looked straight up at the ceiling and said out loud to no one , except Mammon , " The frogs ! The fucking frogs ! " Four desks away , a member of the Stanford Class of 1979 was sitting down , staring at a sheet of paper on his desk and holding a telephone to his ear . His right foot was up on the stirrup of a portable shoeshine stand , and a black man named Felix , who was about fifty  --  or was he about sixty ? ? was humped over his foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long Felix moved from desk to desk , shining the shoes of young bond traders and salesmen as they worked , at three dollars per , counting the tip . Seldom was a word exchanged ; Felix scarcely .. egistered on their maculae . Just then Stanford ' 79 rose from his chair , his eyes still fastened on the sheet of paper , the telephone still at his ear  --  and his right foot still on the shoeshine stirrup  --  and he shouted : " Well then , why do you think everybody 's stripping the fucking twenty-years ? " Never took his foot off the shoeshine stand ! What powerful legs he must have ! thought Sherman . Sherman sat down before his own telephone and computer terminals . The shouts , the imprecations , the gesticulations , the fucking fear and greed , enveloped him , and he loved it . He was the number one bond salesman , " the biggest producer , " as the phrase went , in the bond trading room of Pierce &; Pierce on the fiftieth floor , and he loved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really fucked things up good ! " " ? step up to the fucking plate and ? " " ? bid 81/2 ? " " I 'm away by two thirty-seconds ! " " Somebody 's painting you a fucking picture ! Ca n't you see that ? " " I 'll take an order and buy ' em at 6-plus ! " " Hit the five-year ! " " Sell five ! "  | " You could n't do ten ? " " You think this thing continues up ? " " Strip fever in the twenty-year ! That 's all these jerks keep talking about ! " " ? a hundred million July-nineties at the buck ? " " ? naked short ? " " Jesus Christ , what 's going on ? " " I do n't fucking believe this ! " " Holy fucking shit ! " shouted the Yale men and the Harvard men and the Stanford men . " Ho-lee fuc-king shit . " How these sons of the great universities , these legatees of Jefferson , Emerson , Thoreau , William James , Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other three-name giants of American scholarship  --  how these inheritors of the lux and the veritas now flocked to Wall Street and to the bond trading room of Pierce &; Pierce ! How the stories circulated on every campus ! If you were n't making $250,000 a year within five years , then you were either grossly stupid or grossly lazy . That was the word . By age thirty , $500,000 ? and that sum had the taint of the mediocre . By age forty you were either making a million a year or you were timid and incompetent . Make it now ! That motto burned in every heart , like myocarditis . Boys on Wall Street , mere boys , with smooth jawlines and clean arteries , boys still able to blush , were buying three-million-dollar apartments on Park and Fifth . ( Why wait ? ) They were buying thirty-room , four-acre summer places in Southampton , places built in the 1920s and written off in the 1950s as white elephants , places with decaying servants ' wings , and they were doing t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding on . ( Why not ? We 've got t the servants . ) They had carnival rides trucked in and installed on the great green lawns for their children 's birthday parties , complete with teams of carnival workers to operate them . ( A thriving little industry . ) And where did all of this astonishing new money come from ? Sherman had heard Gene Lopwitz discourse on that subject . In the Lopwitz analysts , they had Lyndon Johnson to thank . Ever so quietly , the U.S. had started printing money by the billions to finance the war in Vietnam . Before anyone , even Johnson , knew what was happening , a worldwide inflation had begun . Everyone woke up to it when the Arabs suddenly jacked up oil prices in the early 1970s . In no time , markets of all sorts became heaving crapshoots : gold , silver , copper , currencies , bank certificates , corporate notes  --  even bonds . For decades the bond business had been the bedridden giant of Wall Street . At firms such as Salomon Broth-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Pierce , twice as yi much money had always changed hands on the bond market as on the stock market . But prices had budged by only pennies at a time , and mostly they went down . As Lopwitz put it , " The bond market has been going down ever since the Battle of Midway . " The Battle of Midway ( Sherman had to look it up ) was in the Second World War . The Pierce &; Pierce bond department had consisted of only twenty souls , twenty rather dull souls known as the Bond Bores . The less promising members lof the firm were steered into bonds , where they could do no harm . Sherman resisted the thought that it had been even thus when he entered the bond department . Well , there was no more talk about Bond Bores these days ... Oh no ! Not at all ! The bond market had caught II , I fire , and experienced salesmen such as himself were all at once much in * which , frankly , to a true Wall Streeter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of thousands of dollars that made her decorating and her lunches and whatever the hell else she did possible ? No , she did not . She took it for granted . . . . . and so forth and so on . Within ninety seconds , emboldened by the mighty roar of the bond trading room of Pierce &; Pierce , Sherman managed to work up a good righteous head of resentment against this woman who had dared make him feel guilty . He picked up the telephone and was ready to resume work on the I greatest coup of his young career , the Giscard , when he spotted some-  | thing out of the corner of his eye . He detected it  --  righteously ! ? amid that great bondscape of writhing limbs and torsos . Arguello was reading a newspaper . Ferdinand Arguello was a junior bond salesman , twenty-five or - six years old , from Argentina . He was leaning back in his chair nonchalantly reading a newspaper , and even from here Sherman could see what it was : The Racing Form . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a South American polo player . He was slender and handsome ; had thick wavy black hair , combed straight back . He was wearing a ? it of red silk moire suspenders . Silk moire . The bond department of ' erce &; Pierce was like an Air Force fighter squadron . Sherman knew it en if this young South American did n't . As the number one bond lesman , Sherman had no official rank . Nevertheless , he occupied a oral eminence . You were either capable of doing the job and willing to vote 100 percent to the job , or you got out . The eighty members of the artment received a base salary , a safety net , of $120,000 a year each . is was regarded as a laughably small sum . The rest of their income e from commissions and profit-sharing . Sixty-five percent of the dertment 's profits went to Pierce &; Pierce . But 35 percent was split ong the eighty bond salesmen and traders themselves . All for one and c for all , and lots for oneself ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! no lightweights ! no loafers ! You headed straight for your k , your telephone , and your computer terminal in the morning . The y did n't start with small talk and coffee and perusals of The Wall Street - urnal and the financial pages of the Times , much less The Racing m . You were expected to get on the telephone and start making sney . If you left the office , even for lunch , you were expected to give r destination and a telephone number to one of the " sales assistants , " o were really secretaries , so that you could be summoned immediately $ new issue of bonds came in ( and had to be sold fast ) . If you went out lunch , it better have something directly to do with selling bonds for rce &; Pierce . Otherwise  --  sit here by the telephone and order in from deli like the rest of the squadron . Sherman walked to Arguello 's desk and stood over him . " What are doing , Ferdi ? " From the moment the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question meant and that he knew he was wrong . But if e was one thing an Argentine aristocrat knew , it was how to brazen it  | ' ' 101 Arguello locked a level gaze onto Sherman 's eyes and said , in a voice just slightly louder than necessary : " I 'm reading The Racing Form . " " What for ? " " What for ? Because four of our horses are racing at Lafayette today . That 's a track outside of Chicago . " With this he resumed reading the newspaper . It was the our that did it . Our was supposed to remind you that you were in the presence of the House of Arguello , lords of the pampas . Besides that , the little shit was wearing a pair of red silk moire suspenders . " Look . . . sport , " said Sherman , " I want you to put that sheet away . " Challengingly : " What did you say ? " " You heard me . I said put that fucking sheet away ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it came out furiously . It came out furiously enough to finish off Judy , Pollard Browning , the doorman , and a would-be mugger . The young man was speechless . " If I ever see you with a Racing Form in here again , you can go sit outside Chicago and make your money ! You can sit on the clubhouse turn and bet perfectas ! This is Pierce &; Pierce , not OTB ! " Arguello was crimson . He was paralyzed with anger . All ' . e could do was beam a ray of pure hatred at Sherman . Sherman , the righteous wrathful one , turned away , and as he did , he noticed with satisfaction that the young man was slowly closing the open expanse of The Racing Form . Wrathful ! Righteous ! Sherman was elated . People were staring . Good ! Idleness was a sin not against the self or against God but against Mammon and Pierce &; Pierce . If he had to be the one to call this greaseball to accounts , then  --  but he regretted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as part of the new era and the new breed , a Wall Street egalitarian , a Master of the Universe who was a respecter only of performance . No longer did Wall Street or Pierce &; Pierce mean Protestan t Good Family . There were plenty of prominent Jewish investment bankers . Lopwitz himself was Jewish . There were plenty of Irishmen , Greeks . and Slays . The fact that not one of the eighty members of the bond department was black or female did n't bother him . Why should it ? 1 t did n't bother Lopwitz , who took the position that the bond trading room at Pierce &; Pierce was no place for symbolic gestures . " Hey , Sherman . "  | He happened to be passing Rawlie Thorpe 's desk . Rawlie was bald , except for a fringe of hair around the back of his head , and yet he still kxiked youthful . He was a great wearer of button-down shirts and Shep Miller suspenders . The button-down collars had a flawless roll . " What was that all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it , " said Sherman . " He 's over there with The RacInK Form , working on fucking horse charts . " He felt compelled to embellish the offense a bit . Rawlie started laughing . " Well , he 's young . He 's probably had it with electric doughnuts . " " Had it with what ? " Rawlie picked up his telephone and pointed to the mouthpiece . " See that ? That 's an electric doughnut . " Sherman stared . It did look sort of like a doughnut , with a lot of little boles instead of one big one . " It just dawned on me today , " said Rawlie . " All I do all day is talk to er electric doughnuts . I just hung up from talking to a guy over at xel . I sold him a million and a half Joshua Tree bonds . " On Wall t you did n't say a million and a half dollars ' worth of bonds . You a million and a half bonds . " That 's some goddamned outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even know his last name . Over the past years I bet I 've done a couple dozen transactions with him , fifty , ty million bonds , and I do n't even know his last name , and I 've never t him , and I probably never will . He 's an electric doughnut . " Sherman did n't find this amusing . In some way it was a repudiation of triumph over the shiftless young Argentinian . It was a cynical denial his very righteousness itself . Rawlie was a very amusing man , but he n't been himself since his divorce . Maybe he was no longer such a t squadron warrior , either . " Yeah , " said Sherman , managing a half smile for his old friend . " Well , tta go call some a my doughnuts . " Back at his desk Sherman settled down to the work at hand . He stared the little green symbols trucking across the computer screen in front of He picked up the telephone . The French gold-backed bond . . . A rd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the ws , quite casually , mentioned the bond , in passing , one evening at rry 's . Back in the innocent year 1973 , on the eve of the heaving crapshoot , be French government had issued a bond known as the Giscard , after be French President , Giscard d'Estaing , with a face value of $6.5 billion .  | The Giscard had an interesting feature : it was backed by gold . So as the price of gold went up and down , so did the price of the Giscard . Since then the price of both gold and the French franc had shot up and down so crazily , American investors had long since lost interest in the Giscard . But lately , with gold holding firm in the $400 range , Sherman had discovered that an American buying Giscards stood to make two to three times the interest he could make on any U.S. government bond , plus a 30 percent profit when the Giscard matured . It was a sleeping beauty . The big danger would be a drop in the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme for selling francs short as a hedge . The only real problem was the complexity of the whole thing . It took big , sophisticated investors to understand it . Big , sophisticated , trusting investors ; no newcomer could talk anybody into putting millions into the Giscard . You had to have a track record . You had to have talent  --  genius ! ? mastery of the universe ! ? like Sherman McCoy , biggest producer at Pierce &; Pierce . He had convinced Gene Lopwitz to put up $600 million of Pierce &; Pierce 's money to buy the Giscard . Gingerly , stealthily , he had bought the bonds from their various European owners without re111 vealing the mighty hand of Pierce &; Pierce , by using various " blind " brokers . Now came the big test for a Master of the Universe . There were only about a dozen players who were likely buyers of anything as esoteric as the Giscard . Of these Sherman had managed to start negotiations with five : two trust banks , Traders ' Trust Co. ( known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of his best private clients , Oscar Suder of Cleveland , who had indicated he would buy $10 million . But by far the most important was Trader T , which was considering taking half the entire lot , $300 million . The deal would bring Pierce &; Pierce a 1 percent commission up front ? $6 million  --  for conceiving of the idea and risking its capital . Sherman 's share , including commissions , bonuses , profit-sharing , and resale fees , would come to about $1.75 million . With that he intended to pay off the horrendous $1.8 million personal loan he had taken out to buy the apartment . So the first order of business today was a call to Bernard Levy , a Frenchman who was handling the deal at Trader T ; a relaxed , friendly call , the call of a biggest-producing salesman ( Master of the Universe ) , to remind Levy that although both gold and the franc had fallen in value yesterday and this morning ( on the European exchanges ) , it meant nothing ; all was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had met Bernard Levy only once , when he made the original presentation . They had been  | conferring on the telephone for months . . . but electric doughnut ? Cynicism was such a cowardly form of superiority . That was Rawlie 's great weakness . Rawlie cashed his checks . He was n't too cynical to do that . If he wanted to belly up because he could n't deal with his wife , that was his sad problem . As Sherman dialed and waited for Bernard Levy to come on the line , the rousing sound of the greed storm closed in about him once again . From the desk right in front of his , a tall bug-eyed fellow ( Yale " 77 ) : " Thirty-one bid January eighty-eights ? " From a desk somewhere behind him : " I 'm short seventy million ten-year ! " From he knew not where : " They got their fucking buying shoes on ! " " I 'm in the box ! " " ? long 125 ? " " ? a million four-years from Midland ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I tell you , I 'm in the box ! " " ? bid 801/2 ? " " ? buy ' em at 6-plus ? " " ? pick up 21/2 basis points ? " " Forget it ! It 's nut-cutting time ! " At ten o'clock , Sherman , Rawlie , and five others convened in the conference room of Eugene Lopwitz 's suite of offices to decide on Pierce &; Pierce 's strategy for the main event of the day in the bond markets , which was a U.S. Treasury auction of 10 billion bonds maturing in twenty years . It was a measure of the importance of the bond business to Pierce &; Pierce that Lopwitz 's offices opened right out into the bond trading room . 0 ' The conference room had no conference table . It looked like the lounge in the English hotel for the Yanks where they serve tea . It was full of small antique tables and cabinets . They were so old , brittle , and highly polished , you got the feeling that if you flicked one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , a wall of plate glass shoved a view of the Hudson River and the rotting piers of New Jersey into your face . Sherman sat in a George II armchair . Rawlie sat next to him , in an old chair with a back shaped like a shield . In other antique or antiqued chairs , with Sheraton and Chippendale side tables beside them , were the head government trader , George Connor , who was two years younger  | than Sherman ; his deputy , Vic Scaasi , who was only twenty-eight ; the chief market analyst , Paul Feiffer ; and Arnold Parch , the executive vice president , who was Lopwitz 's first lieutenant . Everyone in the room sat in a classic chair and stared at a small brown plastic speaker on top of a cabinet . The cabinet was a 220-year-old Adam bowfront , from the period when the brothers Adam liked to paint pictures and ornate borders on wooden furniture . On the center panel was an oval-shaped painting of a Greek maiden sitting in a dell or grotto in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a dusky teal sky . The thing had cost an astonishing amount of money . The plastic speaker was the size of a bedside clock radio . Everyone stared at it , waiting for the voice of Gene Lopwitz . Lopwitz was in London , where it was now 4:00 p.m . He would preside over this meeting by telephone . An indistinct noise came out of the speaker . It might have been a voice and it might have been an airplane . Arnold Parch rose from his armchair and approached the Adam cabinet and looked at the plastic speaker and said , " Gene , can you hear me all right ? " He looked imploringly at the plastic speaker , without taking his eyes off it , as if in fact it were Gene Lopwitz , transformed , the way princes are transformed into frogs in fairy tales . For a moment the plastic frog said nothing . Then it spoke . " Yeah , I can hear you , Arnie . There was a Iotta cheer , . : g going on . " Lopwitz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a storm drain , but you could hear it . " Where are you , Gene ? " asked Parch . " I 'm at a cricket match . " Then less clearly : " What 's the name a this place again ? " He was evidently with some other people . " Tottenham Park , Arnie . I 'm on a kind of a terrace . " " Who 's playing ? " Parch smiled , as if to show the plastic frog that this was n't a serious question . " Do n't get technical on me , Arnie . A lot of very nice young gentlemen in cable-knit sweaters and white flannel pants , is the best I can tell you . " Appreciative laughter broke out in the room , and Sherman felt his own lips bending into the somehow obligatory smile . He glanced about the room . Everyone was smiling and chuckling at the brown plastic speaker except for Rawlie , who had his eyes rolled up in the Oh Brother mode . Then Rawlie leaned over toward Sherman and said , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They think the plastic box has eyes . " This did n't strike Sherman as very funny , since he himself had been grinning . He was also afraid that Lopwitz 's loyal aide , Parch , would  | think he was Rawlie 's confederate in making sport of the maximum leader . " Well , everybody 's here , Gene , " Parch said to the box , " and so I 'm gon na get George to fill you in on where we stand on the auction as of now . " Parch looked at George Connor and nodded and walked back to his chair , and Connor got up from his and walked over to the Adam cabinet and stared at the brown plastic box and said : " Gene ? This is George . " " Yeah , hi , George , " said the frog . " Go ahead . " " Here 's the thing , Gene , " said Connor , standing in front of the Adam commode , unable to take his eyes off the plastic box , " it feels pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The traders are telling us they 'll come in on the new ones at 8.05 , but we think they 're playing games with us . We think we 're gon na get action right down to 8 . So here 's what I figure . We 'll scale in at 8.01 , 8.02 , 8.03 , with the balance at 8.04 . I 'm ready to go 60 percent of the issue . " Which , translated , meant : he was proposing to buy $6 billion of the $10 billion in bonds offered in the auction , with the expectation of a profit of two thirty-seconds of a dollar ? 61/4 ? ? on every one hundred dollars put up . This was known as " two ticks . " Sherman could n't resist another look at Rawlie . He had a small , unpleasant smile on his face , and his gaze seemed to pass several degrees to the right of the Adam commode , toward the Hoboken docks . Rawlie 's presence was like a glass of ice water in the face . Sherman resented him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Here was this outrageous arriviste , Lopwitz  --  Sherman knew Rawlie thought of him that way ? trying to play the nob on the terrace of some British cricket club and at the same time conduct a meeting in New York to decide whether Pierce &; Pierce was going to stake two billion , four billion , or six billion on a single government bond issue three hours from now . No doubt Lopwitz had his own audience on hand at the cricket club to watch this performance , as his great words bounced off a communications satellite somewhere up in the empyrean and hit Wall Street . Well , it was n't hard to find something laughable in it , but Lopwitz was , in truth , a Master of the Universe . Lopwitz was about forty-five years old . Sherman wanted nothing less seven years down the line , when he was forty-five . To be astride the Atlantic . . . with billions at stake ! Rawlie could snigger . . . and sink into his kneecaps . . . but to think what Lopwitz now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year , just from Pierce &; Pierce , which was at least $25 million , to think of the kind of life he led  --  and what  | Sherman thought of first was Lopwitz 's young wife , Snow White . That was what Rawlie called her . Hair as dark as ebony , lips as red as blood , skin as white as snow . . . She was Lopwitz 's fourth wife , French , a countess , apparently , no more than twenty-five or twenty-six , with an accent like Catherine Deneuve doing a bath-oil commercial . She was something . . . Sherman had met her at a party at the Petersons ' . She had put her hand on his forearm , just to make a point in conversation ? but the way she kept the pressure on his arm and stared at him from about eight inches away ! She was a young and frisky animal . Lopwitz had taken what he wanted . He had wanted a young and frisky animal with lips as red as blood and skin as white as snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever happened to the other three Mrs. Eugene Lopwitzes was a question Sherman had never heard brought up . When you had reached Lopwitz 's level , it did n't even matter . " Yeah , well , that sounds all right , George , " said the plastic frog . " What about Sherman ? Are you there , Sherman ? " " Hi , Gene ! " said Sherman , rising from the George II armchair . His own voice sounded very odd to him , now that he was talking to a plastic box , and he did n't dare even take a quick glance at Rawlie as he walked over to the Adam commode and took his stance and stared , rapt , at the machine on top . " Gene , all my customers are talking 8.05 . My gut feeling , though , is that they 're on our side . The market has a good tone . I think we can bid ahead of the customer interest . " " Okay , " said the voice in the box , " but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading accounts . I do n't wan na hear about Salomon or anybody horsing around with shorts . " Sherman found himself marveling at the frog 's wisdom . Some sort of throttled roar came over the speaker . Everybody stared al it . Lopwitz 's voice returned . " Somebody just hit the hell outta the ball , " he said . " The ball 's kinda dead , though . Well , you kinda hadda be there . " It was n't clear what he meant by that . " Well , look , George . Can you hear me , George ? " Connor hopped to it , rose from his chair , hustled over to the Adam commode . " I can hear you , Gene . " " I was just gon na say , if you feel like stepping up to the plate and taking a good whack at it today , go ahead . It sounds okay . "  | And that was that . At forty-five seconds before the auction deadline of 1:00 p.m. , George Connor , at a telephone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final scaled-in bids to a Pierce &; Pierce functionary sitting at a telephone at the Federal Building , which was the physical site of the auction . The bids averaged $99.62643 per $100 worth of bonds . Within a few seconds after 1:00 p.m. , Pierce &; Pierce now owned , as planned , $6 billion worth of the twenty-year bond . The bond department had four Hours in which to create a favorable market . Vic Scaasi led the charge on the bond trading desk , reselling the bonds mainly to the brokerage houses - by telephone . Sherman and Rawlie led the bond salesmen , reselling the bonds mainly to insurance companies and trust banks  --  by telephone . By 2 : ( X ) p.m. , the roar in the bond trading room , fueled more by fear than greed , was unearthly . They all shouted and sweated and swore and devoured their electric doughnuts . By 5:00 p.m. they had sold 40 percent ? $2.4 billion  --  of the $6 billion at an average price of $99.75062 per $100 worth of bonds , for a profit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a profit of twelve and a half cents per one hundred dollars . Four ticks ! To the eventual retail buyer of these bonds , whether an individual , a corporation or an institution , this read was invisible . But four ticks ! To Pierce &; Pierce it meant a profit of almost $3 million for an afternoon 's work . And it would n't stop there . The market was holding firm and edging up . Within the next week they might easily make an additional $5 to $10 million on the 3.6 billion bonds remaining . Four ticks ! 13y five o'clock Sherman was soaring on adrenaline . He was part of the pulverizing might of Pierce &; Pierce , Masters of the Universe . The aucity of it all was breathtaking . To risk $6 billion in one afternoon to ke two ticks  --  six and a quarter cents per one hundred dollars  --  and en to make four ticks  --  four ticks ! ? the audacity ! ? the audacity ! Was there any more exciting power on the face of the earth ? Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let him play the plastic frog ! Master of the Universe  --  the audacity ! The audacity of it flowed through Sherman 's limbs and lymph chanpels and loins . Pierce &; Pierce was the power , and he was wired into the " Power , and the power hummed and surged in his very innards . Judy . . . He had n't thought of her for hours . What was a single , albeit boneheaded , telephone call . . . on the stupendous ledger kept by fierce &; Pierce ? The fiftieth floor was for people who were n't afraid to  | take what they wanted . And , Christ , he did n't want much , compared to what he , a Master of the Universe , should rightfully have . All he wanted was to be able to kick the gong around when he pleased , to have the simple pleasures due all mighty warriors . Where did she get off , giving him such a hard time ? If Middle Age wishes the continued support and escort of a Master of the Universe , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is youth and beauty and juicy jugs and loamy loins It made no sense ! Somehow , for no explicable reason , Judy had always had his number . She looked down on him  --  from a wholly fictive elevation ; nevertheless , she looked down on him . Still the daughter of Professor Miller , E. ( for Egbord ! ) Ronald Miller of DesPortes University , Terwilliger , Wisconsin , poor stodgy Professor Miller , in his rotting tweeds , whose one claim to fame was a rather mealy-mouthed attack ( Sherman had once plowed through it ) on his fellow Wisconsinite , Senator Joseph McCarthy , in the magazine Aspects in 1955 . Yet hack there in the cocoon of their early days together in the Village , Sherman had validated her claim . He had enjoyed telling Judy that while he worked on Wall Street , he was not of Wall Street and was only using Wall Street . He had been pleased when she condescended to admire him for the enlightenment that was stirring in his soul . Somehow she was assuring him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dunning Sponget , was a rather pedestrian figure , after all , a high-class security guard for other people 's capital . As to why that might be important to him , Sherman did n't even know how to speculate . His interest in psychoanalytical theory , never lively , had ended one day at Yale when Rawlie Thorpe had referred to it as " a Jewish science " ( precisely the attitude that had most troubled and infuriated Freud seventy-five years earlier ) . But that was all part of the past , of his childhood , his childhood on East Seventy-third Street and his childhood in the Village . This was a new era ! This was a new Wall Street  --  and Judy was . . . an article left over from his childhood . . . and yet she lived on and grew older , thinner . . . handsome . . . Sherman leaned back in his chair and surveyed the bond trading room . The processions of phosphorescent green characters still skidded across the faces of the computer terminals , but the roar had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood beside Vic Scaasi 's chair with his hands in his pockets , just chatting . Vic arched his back and rolled his shoulders and seemed about to yawn . There was  | Rawlie , reared back in his chair , talking on the telephone , grinning and running his hand over his bald pate . Victorious warriors after the fray . Masters of the Universe . . . And she has the gall to cause him grief over a telephone call !  | **42;105;TOOLONG  --  the noise of the airliners taking off pounded down so hard , he could feel it . The air was full of jet fumes . The stench cut straight through to his stomach . Cars kept popping up from out of the mouth of a ramp and threading their way through the swarms of people who were roaming about on the roof in the dusk looking for the elevators or their cars or other people 's cars  --  steal ! steal ! steal ! ? and his would be the leading candidate , would n't it ? Sherman stood with one hand resting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The car was a black Mercedes two-seat sports roadster that had cost $48,000 or $120,000 , according to how you wanted to look at it . In a Master of the Universe tax bracket , with federal , New York State , and New York City taxes to pay , Sherman had to make $120,000 in order to have $48,000 left to spend on a two-seat sports roadster . How would he explain it to Judy if the thing were stolen from up here on the roof of a terminal at Kennedy Airport ? Well  --  why would he even owe her an explanation ? For a solid week he had had dinner at home every night . It must have been the first time he had managed that since he started working for Pierce &; Pierce . He had been attentive to Campbell , spending upward of forty-five minutes with her one evening , which was unusual , although he would have been suprised and offended if anybody had ever pointed that out . He had rewired a floor lamp in the library without any undue fuming and sighing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up the  | daybed in the dressing room and come back to the bedroom . True , the Berlin Wall now ran down the center of the bed , and she would n't give him an inch of small talk . But she was always civil to him when Campbell was around . That was the most important thing . Two hours ago when he had called Judy to say he would be working late , she had taken it in stride . Well  --  he deserved it ! He took one last look at the Mercedes and headed for the international arrivals area . It was down in the bowels of the building , in what must have been designed as a baggage area originally . Strips of fluorescent lights struggled against the gloominess of the space . People were jammed behind a metal fence , waiting for passengers coming in from abroad to emerge from Customs . Suppose there was someone here who knew him and Judy ? He surveyed the crowd . Shorts , sneakers , jeans , football jerseys ? Christ , who were these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Customs . Sweat suits , T-shirts , windbreakers , tube socks , overalls , warm-up jackets , baseball caps , and tank tops ; just in from Rome , Milan , Paris , Brussels , Munich , and London ; the world travelers ; the cosmopolites ; Sherman lifted his Yale chin against the tide . When Maria finally appeared , she was n't hard to spot . In this mob she looked like something from another galaxy . She was wearing a skirt and a big-shouldered jacket of a royal blue that was fashionable in France , a blue-and-white-striped silk blouse , and electric-blue lizard pumps with white calf caps on the toes . The price of the blouse and the shoes alone would have paid for the clothes on the backs of any twenty women on the floor . She walked with a nose-up sprocket-hipped model-girl gait calculated to provoke maximum envy and resentment . People were staring . Beside her marched a porter with an aluminum dolly cart heaped with luggage , a prodigious amount of it , a matched set , cream-colored leather with chocolate leather trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Louis Vuitton , thought Sherman . She had only gone to Italy for a week , to find a house on Lake Como for the summer . He could n't imagine why she had taken so many bags . ( Unconsciously he associated such things with a slack upbringing . ) He wondered how he was going to get it all in the Mercedes . He made his way around the fence and strode toward her . He squared his shoulders . " Hello , babe , " he said . " Babe ? " said Maria . She added a smile , as if she were n't really annoyed , but obviously she was . It was true that he had never called her  | babe before . He had wanted to sound confident but casual , like a Master of the Universe meeting his girlfriend in an airport . He took her arm and fell in step with her and decided to try again . " How was the flight ? " " It was great , " said Maria , " if you do n't mind being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a couple of beats before Sherman realized she was saying bored . She gazed into the distance , as if reflecting upon her ordeal . Up on the roof , the Mercedes had survived the thieving multitudes . The skycap could n't get much of the luggage into the car 's sporty little trunk . He had to stack half of it up on the back seat , which was n't much 111 more than an upholstered ledge . Terrific , thought Sherman . If I have to stop short , I 'll get hit in the base of the skull by matched flying creamcolored vanity cases with chocolate-brown trim . By the time they got out of the airport and went onto the Van Wyck Expressway toward Manhattan , only the last low dull glow of daylight was visible behind the buildings and the trees of South Ozone Park . It was that hour of dusk when the streetlights and headlights come on but make little difference . A stream of red taillights rolled on ahead of them . 11111 Over on the side of the expressway , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sort of car they used to make in the 1970s , up against a stone retaining wall . A man . . . spread-eagled on the highway ! . . . No , as they drew closer , he could see it was n't a man at all . It was the hood of the car . The entire hood had been pulled off and was lying on the pavement . The wheels , seats , and steering wheel were gone . . . This huge derelict machine was now part of the landscape . . . Sherman , Maria , the luggage , and the Mercedes rolled on . He tried once more . " Well , how was Milan ? What 's going on at Lake Como ? " " Sherman , who 's Christopher Marlowe ? " Shuhmun , who 's Christuphuh Muhlowe ? Christopher Marlowe ? " I do n't know . Do I know him ? " " The one I 'm talking about was a writer . " " You do n't mean the playwright ? " " I guess so . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sounded as if her last friend had died . " Christopher Marlowe . . . He was a British playwright , about the time of Shakespeare , I think . Maybe a little before Shakespeare . Why ? " " Which was when ? " She could n't have sounded more miserable .  | 4 " Let 's see . I do n't know . . . The sixteenth century-15-something . Why ? " " What did he write ? " " God . . . beats me . Listen , I thought I was doing well just to remember who he was . Why ? " " Yes , but you do know who he was . " " Barely . Why ? " " What about Dr. Faustus ? " " Dr. Faustus ? " " Did he write something about Dr. Faustus ? " " Mmmmmmmm . " A tiny flash of memory ; but it slipped away . " Could be . Dr. Faustus . . . The Jew of Malta ! He wrote a play called The Jew of Malta . I 'm pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even know how I remember The Jew of Malta . I 'm sure I never read it . " " But you do know who he was . That 's one of the things you 're supposed to know , is n't it ? " And there she had put her finger on it . The only thing that had truly stuck in Sherman 's mind about Christopher Marlowe , after nine years at Buckley , four years at St. Paul 's , and four years at Yale , was that you were , in fact , supposed to know who Christopher Marlowe was . But he was n't about to say that . Instead , he asked : " Who 's supposed to ? " " Anybody , " Maria mumbled . " Me . " It was getting darker . The Mercedes 's spiffy dials and gauges were now lit up like a fighter plane 's . They were nearing the Atlantic Avenue overpass . There was another abandoned car by the side of the road . The wheels were gone , the hood was up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jackknifed over the engine well . Maria continued to look straight ahead as they merged with the traffic on Grand Central Parkway . A galaxy of streaming headlights and taillights filled their field of vision , as if the energy of the city were now transformed into millions of globes of light orbiting in the darkness . Here , inside the Mercedes , with the windows rolled up , the entire stupendous show came gliding by without a sound . " You know something , Sherman ? " You know somethun , Shuhmun ? " I hate the Brits . I hate ' um . " " You hate Christopher Marlowe ? " 4 " Thank you , smartie , " said Maria . " You sound just like the sonofahitch I sat next to . " Now she was looking at Sherman and smiling . It was the kind of smile  | you bring up bravely through great pain . Her eyes looked as if they might be about to spring tears . " Which sonofabitch ? " he said . " On the plane . This Brit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was looking at the catalogue from the Reiner Fetting show I saw in Milano " ? it annoyed Sherman that she used the Italian , Milano , instead of the English , Milan , especially since he had never heard of Reiner Fetting ? " and he starts talking about Reiner Fetting . He had one a those gold Rolexes , those huge things ? It 's a wonder you can lift your 1 arm ? " She had the Southern Girl habit of turning declarative sentences into questions . " You think he was making a play ? " Maria smiled , this time with pleasure . " Of course ' ' was ! " The smile brought Sherman great relief . The spell was broken . Just why , he did n't know . He did n't realize that there were women who thought about sexual attractiveness the way he thought about the bond market . He only knew that the spell had been broken and that the weight had been lifted . It did n't really matter what she chattered on about now . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had suffered . " He could n't wait to tell me he was a movie producer . He was making a movie based on this play , Doctor Faustus , by Christopher Marlowe , or 11 just Marlowe , I think that was all he said , just Marlowe , and I do n't even know why I said anything , but I thought somebody named Marlowe wrote for the movies . Actually , what I think I was thinking about was , there was this movie with a character named Marlowe . Robert Mitchum was in it . " " That 's right . It was a Raymond Chandler story . " Maria looked at him with utter blankness . He dropped Raymond Chandler . " So what did you say to him ? " " I said , Oh , Christopher Marlowe . Did n't he write a movie ? " And you know what this . . . bastard . . . says to me ? He says , I should n't think so . He died in 1593 . ' I should n't think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited a moment . " That 's it ? " " That 's it ? I wanted to strangle him . It was . . . humiliating . 1 should n't think so . I could n't believe the . . . snottiness . " " What did you say to him ? " " Nothing . I turned red . I could n't say a word . " " And that 's what accounts for this mood of yours ? "  | " Sherman , tell me the honest truth . If you do n't know who Christopher Marlowe is , does that make you stupid ? " " Oh , for God 's sake , Maria . I ca n't believe that 's what put you in such a mood . " " What mood ? " " This black cloud you landed in . " " You did n't answer me , Sherman . Does that make you stupid ? " " Do n't be ridiculous . I could barely think of who he was , and I probably had him in a course or something . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least you had him in a course . I did n't have him in any course . That 's what makes me feel so  --  you do n't even understand what I 'm talking about , do you ? " " I sure do n't . " He smiled at her , and she smiled back . By now they were passing La Guardia Airport , which was lit up by hundreds of sodium vapor lights . It did n't look like a great gateway to the sky . It looked like a factory . Sherman swung to the outside and hit the accelerator and sent the Mercedes barreling under the Thirty-first Street overpass and up the ramp onto the Triborough Bridge . The cloud had passed . He was feeling pleased with himself once again . He had jollied her out of it . Now he had to slow down . All four lanes were heavy with traffic . As the Mercedes ascended the bridge 's great arc , he could see the island of Manhattan off to the left . The towers were jammed together so tightly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the millions , from all over the globe , who yearned to be on that island , in those towers , in those narrow streets ! There it was , the Rome , the Paris , the London of the twentieth century , the city of ambition , the dense magnetic rock , the irresistible destination of all those who insist on being where things are happening  --  and he was among the victors ! He lived on Park Avenue , the street of dreams ! He worked on Wall Street , fifty floors up , for the legendary Pierce &; Pierce , overlooking the world ! He was at the wheel of a $48,000 roadster with one of the most beautiful women in New York  --  no Comp . Lit. scholar , perhaps , but gorgeous  --  beside him ! A frisky young animal ! He was of that breed whose natural destiny it was . . . to have what they wanted ! He took one hand off the wheel and made a grand gesture toward the mighty island . " There it is , babe ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just feel like calling you babe , babe . New York City . There it is. "  | " Do you really think I 'm the babe type ? " " You 're as babe as they come , Maria . Where do you want to have dinner ? It 's all yours . New York City . " " Sherman ! Are n't you supposed to turn there ? " He looked to the right . It was true . He was two lanes to the left of the lanes that led to the off-ramp to Manhattan , and there was no way he could cut across . By now this lane  --  the next lane  --  the next lane  --  every lane  --  was a train of cars and trucks , bumper to bumper , inching toward a toll plaza a hundred yards ahead . Above the plaza was a huge green sign , lit up by yellow lamps , saying BRONX UPSTATE N.Y . NEW ENGLAND . " Sherman , I 'm sure that 's the turnoff to Manhattan . " " You 're right , sweetheart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there now . " " Where does this go ? " " The Bronx . " The trains of vehicles inched forward in a cloud of carbon and sulphur particles toward the toll gates . The Mercedes was so low-slung , Sherman had to reach way up to surrender two dollar bills at the booth . A tired-looking black man stared down at him from the window of a very high perch . Something had made a long gash in the side of the booth . The gully was corroding . A vague smoky abysmal uneasiness was seeping into Sherman 's skull . The Bronx . . . He had been born and raised in New York and took a manly pride in knowing the city . I know the city . But in fact his familiarity with the Bronx , over the course of his thirty-eight years , was derived from five or six trips to the Bronx Zoo , two to the Botanical Gardens . and perhaps a dozen trips to Yankee Stadium , the last one in 1977 for a World Series game . He did know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manhattan 's . What he would do would be ? well , he would get on a cross street and take that west until he reached one of the avenues that take you back down into Manhattan . How bad could it be ? The tide of red taillights flowed on ahead of them , and now they bothered him . In the darkness , amid this red swarm , he could n't get his bearings . His sense of direction was slipping away . He must be heading north still . The down side of the bridge had n't curved a great deal . But now there were only signs to go by . His entire stock of landmarks was gone , left behind . At the end of the bridge the expressway split into a Y. MAJOR DEEGAN GEO . WASHINGTON BRIDGE . . . BRUCKNER NEW EN-  | GLAND . . . Major Deegan went upstate . . . No ! . . . Veer right . . . Suddenly another Y . . . EAST BRONX NEW ENGLAND . . . EAST 138TH BRUCKNER BOULEVARD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Acey-deucey . . . one finger , two fingers . . . He veered right again . . EAST 138TH . . . a ramp . . . All at once there was no more ramp , no more clean cordoned expressway . He was at ground level . It was as if he had fallen into a junkyard . He seemed to be underneath the expressway . In the blackness he could make out a cyclone fence over on the left . . . something caught in it . . . A woman 's head ! . . . No , it was a chair with three legs and a burnt seat with the charred stuffing hanging out in great wads , rammed halfway through a cyclone fence . Who on earth would jam a chair into the mesh of a cyclone fence ? And why ? " Where are we , Sherman ? " He could tell by the tone of her voice that there were n't going to be any more discussions of Christopher Marlowe or where to have dinner . " We 're in the Bronx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure . If I can just find a cross street . . . Let 's see , let 's see , let 's see .. . 138th Street ... " They were traveling north underneath the expressway . But what expressway ?

There ! The sign ? 138th Street . . . He keeps to the left , to make the turn . . . A big opening in the wall . . . 138th Street . . . But he ca n't turn left ! To his left are four or five lanes of traffic , down here underneath the expressway , two going north , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end trucks barreling in both directions  --  there 's no way he can cut across that traffic . . . So he keeps going . . . into the Bronx . . . Another opening in the wall coming up . . . He hugs the left lane . . . Same situation ! . . . No way to turn left ! . . . He begins to feel trapped here in the gloom beneath the expressway . . . But how bad could it be ? . Plenty of traffic .. . " What are we doing , Sherman ? " " I 'm trying to turn left , but there 's no way you can turn left off of this goddamned road . I 'm going to have to turn right somewhere up here and make a U-turn or something and come back across . "  | Maria had no comment . Sherman glanced at her . She was looking straight ahead , grimly . Off to the right , above some low decrepit buildings , he could see a billboard that said TOPS IN THE BRONX MEAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Another opening in the wall up ahead . . . He starts bearing to the right , % is time  --  a tremendous horn ! ? a truck passing him on the right . . . He swerves left " Sherman ! " " Sorry , babe . " ? too late to make the right turn . . . He keeps going , hugs the right side of the right lane , ready for the turn . . . Another opening . . turns right . . . a wide street . . . What a lot of people all of a sudden . . . Half of them seem to be out in the street . . . dark , but they look Latin . . . Puerto Ricans ? . . . Over there a long low building with scalloped dormer windows . . . like something from a storybook Swiss chalet . . . but terribly blackened . . . Over here a bar  --  he stares ? half covered in metal shutters . . . So many people in the street . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows missing . . . entire sashes gone . . . A red light . He stops . He can see Maria 's head panning this way and that . . . " O00000aaaggggh ! " A tremendous scream off to the left . . . A young man with a wispy mustache and a sport shirt is sauntering across the street . A girl runs after him screaming . " O00000aggggh ! " . . . Dark face , frizzy blond hair . . . She throws her arm around his neck , but in slow motion , as if she 's drunk . " O00000aaggggh ! " Trying to strangle him ! He does n't even look at her He just rams his elbow back into her stomach . She slides off his body She 's down on the street on all fours . He keeps walking . Never looks back . She gets up . She lunges toward him again . " O000aagggh ! " Nov they 're right in front of the car . Sherman and Maria are sitting in their tan leather bucket seats staring right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the neck again . He gives her another whack in the midsection with his elbow . The light changes , but Sherman ca n't budge . People have conic out into the street from both sides to watch the imbroglio . They 're laugh ing . They 're cheering . She 's pulling his hair . He 's grimacing and whack ing her backward with both elbows . People all over the place . Sherman looks at Maria . Neither has to say a word . Two white people , one of their a young woman decked out in a royal-blue Avenue Foch jacket with shoulders out to here . . . enough matched luggage in the back seat for  | a trip to China . . . a $48,000 Mercedes roadster . . . in the middle of the South Bronx . . . Miraculous ! No one pays any attention to them . Just another car at the light . The two combatants gradually edge off to the other side of the street . Now they 're grappling like Sumo wrestlers , face to face . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gasping for breath . They 've had it . They might as well be dancing . The crowd 's losing interest , drifting away . Sherman says to Maria , " True love , babe . " Wants to make her think he 's not worried . Now there 's no one in front of the car , but the light has turned red again . He waits it out , then heads down the street . Not so many people now . . . a wide street . He makes a U-turn , heads back the way they came . . . " What are you gon na do now , Sherman ? " " I think we 're okay . This is a main cross street . We 're heading in the right direction . We 're heading west . " But when they crossed the big thoroughfare under the expressway , they found themselves in a chaotic intersection . Streets converged from odd angles . . . People were crossing the street in every direction . . . f Dark faces . . . Over this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shops . . . Great Taste Chinese Takeout . . . He could n't tell which street went due west . . That one  --  the likeliest  --  he turned that way . . . a wide street . . . cars parked on both sides . . . up ahead , double-parked . . . triple-parked . . . a crowd . . . Could he even get through ? . . . So he turned . .. that way . . . There was a street sign , but the names of the streets were no longer parallel to the streets themselves . East Something seemed to be . . . in that direction . . . So he took that street , but it quickly merged with a narrow side street and ran between some low buildings . The buildings appeared to be abandoned . At the next corner he turned  --  west , he figured  --  and followed that street a few blocks . There were more low buildings . They might have been garages and they might have been sheds . There were fences with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted , which was okay , he told himself , and yet he could feel his heart beating with a nervous twang . Then he turned again . A narrow street lined with sevenor eight-story apartment buildings ; no sign of people ; not a light in a window . The next block , the same . He turned again , and as he rounded the corner-astonishing . Utterly empty , a vast open terrain . Block after block ? how many ? ? six ? eight ? a dozen ? ? entire blocks of the city without a  | building left standing . There were streets and curbing and sidewalks and light poles and nothing else . The eerie grid of a city was spread out before him , lit by the chemical yellow of the street lamps . Here and there were traces of rubble and slag . The earth looked like concrete , except that it rolled down this way . . . and up that way . . . the hills and dales of the Bronx . . . reduced to asphalt , concrete , and cinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to look twice to make sure he was in fact still driving on a New York street . The street led up a long slope . . . Two blocks away . three blocks away . . . it was hard to tell on this enormous vacant lot . . . There was a lone building , the last one . . . It was on the corner . . . three or four stories high . . . It looked as if it were ready to keel over at any moment . . . It was lit up at the ground level , as if there was a store or a bar . . . Three or four people were out on the sidewalk . Sherman could see them under the streetlight on the corner . " What is this , Sherman ? " Maria was staring right at him . " The southeast Bronx , I guess . " " You mean you do n't know where we are ? " " I know about where we are . As long as we keep heading west we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're heading west ? " " Oh , do n't worry , we 're heading west . It 's just , uh . . . " " It 's just what ? " . " If you see a street sign . . . I 'm looking for a numbered street . " The truth was , Sherman could no longer tell which way he was heading . As they drew near the building , he could hear thung thung thung thung thung thung . He could hear it even though the windows of the cars were up . . . A bass violin . . . An electrical cord looped down from ufdl the light pole on the corner through the open door . Out on the sidewalk was a woman wearing what looked like a basketball jersey and shorts , and two men in short-sleeved sport shirts . The woman was leaning over with her hands on her knees , laughing and swinging her head around in a big circle . The two men were laughing at her . Were they Puerto Rican ? There was no telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cord went , Sherman could see a low light and silhouettes . Thung thung thung thung thung . . . the bass . . . then the tops of some trumpet notes . . . Latin music ? . . . The woman 's head went around and around . He glanced at Maria . She sat there in her terrific royal-blue jacket . Her  | thick dark bobbed hair framed a face that was as frozen as a photograph . Sherman sped up and left the eerie outpost in the wasteland . He turned toward some buildings . . . over there . . . He passed houses with no sashes in the windows . . . They came upon a little park with an iron railing around it . You had to turn either left or right . The streets went off at odd angles . Sherman had lost track of the grid pattern altogether . It no longer looked like New York . It looked like some small decaying New England city . He turned left . " Sherman , I 'm beginning not to like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's kid now ? " " You did n't like babe . " He wanted to sound nonchalant . Now there were cars parked along the street . . . Three youths stood beneath a streetlight ; three dark faces . They wore quilted jackets . They stared at the Mercedes . Sherman turned again . Up ahead he could see the fuzzy yellow glow of what seemed to be a wider , more brightly lit street . The closer they came to it , the more people . . . on the sidewalks , in doorways , out in the street . . . What a lot of dark faces . . . Up ahead , something in the street . His headlights were soaked up by the darkness . Then he could make it out . A car parked out in the middle of the street , nowhere near the curb . . . a group of boys standing around it . . . More dark faces . . . Could he even get around them ? He pushed the button that locked the doors . The electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a snare drum . He eased by . The boys stooped down and stared in the windows of the Mercedes . Out of the corner of his eye he could see one of them smiling . But he said nothing . He just stared and grinned . Thank God , there was enough room . Sherman kept easing on by . Suppose he had a flat tire ? Or the engine flooded ? That would be a pretty fix . But he did n't feel rattled . He was still on top of it . Just keep rolling . That 's the main thing . A $48,000 Mercedes . Come on , you Krauts , you Panzer heads , you steely-brained machinists . . . Do it right . . . He made it past the car . Up ahead , a thoroughfare . . . Traffic was going across the intersection at a good clip in both directions . He let his breath out . He 'd take it ! To the right ! To the left ! It did n't matter . He reached the intersection . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started through . " Sherman , you 're going through a red light ! " " Good . Maybe the cops 'll come . That would n't upset me too much . "  | Maria was n't saying a word . The concerns of her luxurious life were now tightly focused . Human existence had but one purpose : to get out of the Bronx . Up ahead the vaporous mustard glow of the . s .. eetlights was brighter and more spread out . . . Some sort of major intersection . . . Wait a second . . . Up there , a subway entrance . . . Over here , shops , cheap food joints . . . Texas Fried Chicken . . . Great Taste Chinese TakeH out . . . Great Taste Chinese Takeout ! Maria was thinking the same thing . " Jesus Christ , Sherman , we 're back where we started ! You been around in a circle ! " " I know it . I know it . Just hold on a second . I tell you what . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na head back down under the expressway . I 'm gon na ? " " Do n't get under that thing again , Sherman . " The expressway was right up above . The light was green . Sherman did n't know what to do . Someone was blowing a horn behind him . " Sherman ! Look over there ! It says George Washington Bridge ! " Where ? The horn kept blowing . Then he saw it . It was on the far side , beneath the expressway , in the decrepit gray gloaming , a sign on a concrete support . . . 95. 895 EAST . GEO . WASH . BRIDGE . . . Must be a ramp . . r " But we do n't want to go in that direction ! That 's north ! " " So what , Sherman ? At least you know what it is ! At least it 's civilization ! Let 's get outta here ! " The horn blared . Somebody was back there yelling . Sherman gunned it , while he still had the light . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was back under the expressway . " It 's right over there , Sherman ! " " Okay , okay , I see it . " The ramp looked like a black chute stuck up between the concrete supports . The Mercedes took a hard bounce from a pothole . " Christ , " said Sherman , " I did n't even see that . " He leaned forward over the steering wheel . The headlights shot across the concrete columns in a delirium . He shifted into second gear . He turned left around an abutment and gunned it up the ramp . Bodies ! . . . Bodies in the road ! . . . Two of them curled up ! . . . No , not bodies . . . ridges in the side . . . molds . . . No , containers , some kind of Icontainers . . . Trash cans . . . He 'd have to squeeze to the left to get around them . . . He shifted down into first gear and turned to the left . . . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought someone  | had jumped off the guardrail of the ramp . . . Not big enough . . . It was an animal . . . It was lying in the road , blocking the way . . . Sherman jammed down on the brake . . . A piece of luggage hit him in the back of his head . . . two pieces . . . A shriek from Maria . A suitcase was on top of her headrest . The car had stalled . Sherman set the brake and pulled the suitcase off her and shoved it back . " You okay ? " She was n't looking at him . She was staring through the windshield . " What is that ? " t Blocking the road  --  it was n't an animal . . . Treads . . . It was a Wheel . . . His first thought was that a wheel had come off a car up on e expressway and it had bounced down here onto the ramp . All at once She car was dead quiet , because the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tested the brake to make sure it was lire . Then he opened the door . " What are you doing , Sherman ? " " I 'm gon na push it out of the way . " " Be careful . What if a car 's coming ? " " Well . " He shrugged and got out . He felt strange from the moment he set foot on the ramp . From overbead the tremendous clanging noise of vehicles going over some sort of petal joint or plate in the expressway . He was staring up at the expressy 's black underbelly . He could n't see the cars . He could only hear m pounding the road , apparently at great speed , making the clanging ise and creating a field of vibration . The vibration enveloped the great rroded black structure with a hum . But at the same time he could hear shoes , his $650 New &; Lingwood shoes , New &; Lingwood of Jermyn t , London , with their English leather soles and heels , making tiny tty scraping sounds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y gritty scraping sound of his shoes was as sharp as any sound he had r heard . He leaned over . It was n't a wheel , after all , only a tire . imagine a car losing a tire . He picked it up . " Sherman ! " He turned around , toward the Mercedes . Two figures ! . . . Two young men  --  black  --  on the ramp , coming up behind him . . . Boston Celtics ! . . . The one nearest him had on a silvery basketball warm-up locket with CELTICS written across the chest . . . He was no more than bur or five steps . away . . . powerfully built . . . His jacket was open . a white T-shirt . . tremendous chest muscles . . . a square face  | . . . wide jaws . a wide mouth . . . What was that look ? Hunter ! Predator ! . . The youth stared Sherman right in the eye . . walking slowly . . The other one was tall but skinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . a delicate face . . . eyes wide open . . . startled . . . He looked terrified . . . He wore a big loose sweater . . . He was a step or two behind the big one . . . " Yo ! " said the big one . " Need some help ? " Sherman stood there , holding the tire and staring . " What happen , man ? Need some help ? " It was a neighborly voice . Setting me up ! One hand inside his jacket pocket ! But he sounds sincere . It 's a setup , you idiot ! But suppose he merely wants to help ? What are they doing on this ramp ! Have n't done anything  --  have n't threatened . But they will ! Just be nice . Are you insane ? Do something ! Act ! A sound filled his skull , the sound of rushing steam He held the tire up in front of his chest . Now ! Bango  --  he charged at the big one and shoved the tire at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tire was coming right back at him ! He threw his arms up . It bounced oil his arms . A sprawl  --  the brute fell over the tire . Silvery CELTICS jacketon the pavement . Sherman 's own momentum carried him forward . Ile skidded on the New &; Lingwood party shoes . He pivoted . " Sherman ! " Maria was behind the wheel of the car . The engine was roaring . The door on the passenger side was open . " Get in ! " The other one , the skinny one , was between him and the car . . . terrified look on his mug . . . eyes wide open . . . Sherman was pure frenzy . . . Had to get to the car ! . . . He ran for it . He lowered his head . He crashed into him . The boy went spinning back and hit the real fender of the car but did n't fall down . " Henry ! " The big one was getting up . Sherman threw himself into the car . Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ! " The roaring engine . . . the Panzer-head Mercedes dials . . . A blue outside the car . . . Sherman grabbed the door pull and with a tremen dous adrenal burst banged it shut . Out of the corner of his eye , the by one  --  almost to the door on Maria 's side . Sherman hit the lock mecha nism . Rap ! He was yanking on the door handle  --  cetTlcs inches from Maria 's head with only the glass in between . Maria shoved the Mercedes into first gear and squealed forward . The youth leaped to one side . The car was heading straight for the trash cans . Maria hit the brakes . Sher  | man was thrown against the dash . A vanity case landed on top of the gearshift . Sherman pulled it off . Now it was on his lap . Maria threw the oar into reverse . It shot backward . He glanced to his right . The skinny tone . . . The skinny boy was standing there staring at him . . . pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into first gear again . . She was breathing in huge gulps , as if she were drowning . . . Sherman yelled , " Look out ! " The big one was coming toward the car . He had the tire up over his d . Maria squealed the car forward , right at him . He lurched out of the way . . . a blur . . . a terrific jolt . . . The tire hit the windshield and bounced off , without breaking the glass . . . The Krauts ! . . . Maria tie the wheel to the left , to keep from hitting the cans . . . The skinny standing right there . . . The rear end fishtailed . . . thoki . . . The skinny boy was no longer standing . . . Maria fought the steering wheel . . . A clear shot between the guardrail and the trash cans . . . She floored it . . . A furious squeal . . . The Mercedes shot up the amp . . . The road rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . e huge tongue of the expressway . . . Lights rocketing by . . . Mabraked the car . . . Sherman and the vanity case were thrown up inst the dashboard ... Hahhh hahhhhh hahhhhh " You okay ? " She gunned the car forward . The blare of a horn " For Christ 's sake , Maria ! " The blaring horn swerved and hurtled past , and they were out on the ressway . His eyes were stinging with perspiration . He took one hand off the ity case to rub his eyes , but it started shaking so badly he put it back the case . He could feel his heart beating in his throat . He was soaking wet . His jacket was coming apart . He could feel it . It was ripped in the lack seams . His lungs were struggling for more oxygen . They were barreling along the expressway , much too fast . " Slow down , Maria ! Jesus Christ ! " " Where 's it go , Sherman ? Where 's it go ? " " Just follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's sake , slow down . " Maria took one hand off the steering wheel to push back her hair from lit forehead . Her entire arm , as well as her hand , was shaking . Sherman ' Pondered if she could control the car , but he did n't want to break her  | concentration . His heart was racing along with hollow thuds , as if it had broken loose inside his rib cage . " Aw shit , my arms are shaking ! " said Maria . Aw shit , muh uhms uh shakin ' . He had never heard her use the word shit before . " Just take it easy , " said Sherman . " We 're okay now , we 're okay . " " But where 's it go ! " " Just take it easy ! Just follow the signs . George Washington Bridge " " Aw shit , Sherman , that 's what we did before ! " " Take it easy , for Christ 's sake . I 'll tell you where . " " Do n't fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands gripping the vanity case in his lap as if it were a second wheel . He tried to concentrate on the road ahead . Then he stared at a sign over the highway up ahead : CROSS BRONX GEO . WASH BRIDGE . " Cross Bronx ! What 's that ? " " Just take it ! " " Shit , Sherman ! " " Stay on the highway . We 're okay . " The navigator . He stared at the white line on the roadbed . He stared so hard , thc ' began separating on him . . . the lines . . . the signs . . . the tad lights . . . He could n't figure out the pattern any longer . . . He was concentrating on . . . fragments ! . . . molecules ! . . . atoms ! . . Jesus Christ ! . . . I 've lost the power to reason ! . . . His heart went into palpitations . . . and then a big . . . snap ! . . . it went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead : MAJOR DEEGAN TRIBORO BRIDGE . " See that , Maria ? Triborough Bridge ! Take that ! " " Jesus Christ , Sherman , George Washington Bridge ! " " No ! We want the Triborough , Maria ! That 'll take us right back into Manhattan ! " So they took that expressway . Presently , overhead : WILLIS AVE . " What 's Willis Avenue ? " " I think it 's the Bronx , " said Sherman . " Shit ! " " Just stay to your left ! We 're okay ! " " Shit , Sherman ! " Over the highway a big sign : TRIBORO . " There it is , Maria ! You see that ! " " Yeah . " " Bear to your right up there . You exit to the right ! " Now Sherman w ,  | gripping the vanity case and giving it the body English for a right turn . He was holding a vanity case and giving it body English . Maria had on an Avenue Foch royal-blue jacket with shoulder pads . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writhing under royal-blue shoulder pads from Paris . . . the two of them in a $48,000 Mercedes with spiffy airplane dials . . . desperate to escape the Bronx . . . They reached the exit . He held on for dear life , as if a tornado were going to rise up at any moment and blow them out of the proper groove and  --  back to the Bronx ! They made it . Now they were on the long incline that led to the bridge and to Manhattan . Hahhhhh hahhhhhh hahhhhhh hahhhhh " Sherman ! " He stared at her . She was sighing and taking in huge gulps of air . " It 's okay , sweetheart . " " Sherman , he threw it . . . right at me ! " " Threw what ? " " That . . . wheel , Sherman ! " The tire had hit the windshield right in front of her eyes . But something else flashed into Sherman 's mind . . . thok ! . . . the sound of the rear fender hitting something and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let out a sob . " Get a grip on yourself ! We 've only got a little farther ! " " " She snuffled back her tears.God . . . Sherman reached over and massaged the back of her neck with his left hand . t ' Oh Sh neck " You 're okay , honey . You 're doing swell . " erman . " The odd thing was  --  and it struck him as odd in that very moment  --  he wanted to smile . I saved her ! I am her protector ! He kept rubbing her " It was only a tire , " said the protector , savoring the luxury of calming the weak . " Otherwise it would 've broken the windshield . " " He threw it . . . right . . . at me . " " I know , I know . It 's okay . It 's all over . " But he could hear it again . The little thok . And the skinny boy was gone . " Maria , I think you  --  I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already a deep instinct was summoning up the clammy patriarch , blame . Maria did n't say anything .  | " You know when we skidded . There was this kind of a . . . this kind of a . . . little sound , a little thok . " Maria remained silent . Sherman was staring at her . Finally she said , " Yeah  --  I ? I do n't know . I do n't give a shit , Sherman . All I care is , we got outta there . " " Well , that 's the main thing , but ? " " Oh , God , Sherman , like  --  the worst nightmare ! " She started choking back sobs , all the while hunched forward and staring straight ahead , through the windshield , concentrating on the traffic . " It 's okay , sweetheart . We 're okay now . " He rubbed her neck some more . The skinny boy was standing there . Thok . He was n't standing there anymore . The traffic was getting heavier . The tide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up an incline . They were n't far from the bridge . Maria slowed down . In the darkness , the toll plaza was a great smear of concrete turned yellowish by the lights above . Out front , the red lights became a swarm closing in on the tollbooths . In the distance Sherman could see the dense black of Manhattan . Such gravity . . . so many lights . . . so many people . . . so many souls sharing this yellow smear of concrete with him . . . and all of them oblivious of what he had just been through ! Sherman waited until they were rolling down the FDR Drive , along the East River , back in White Manhattan and Maria was calmer , before he brought the subject up again . " Well , what do you think , Maria ? I guess we ought to report this to the police . " She did n't say anything . He looked at her . She stared grimly at the roadway . " What do you think ? " " What for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sherman , shut up . " She said it softly , gently . " Just let me drive this goddamn car . " The familiar 1920s Gothic palisades of New York Hospital were just up ahead . White Manhattan ! They took the Seventy-first Street exit off the drive . Maria parked across the street from the town house and her fourthfloor hideaway . Sherman got out and immediately scrutinized the right rear fender . To his great relief  --  no dent ; no sign of anything , at least not  | here in the dark . Since Maria had told her husband she would n't be returning from Italy until the next day , she wanted to take the luggage up to the little apartment , too . Three times Sherman climbed up the creaking staircase , in the miserable gloaming of the Landlord 's Halos , hauling up the luggage . Maria took off her royal-blue jacket with the Paris shoulders and put it on the bed . Sherman took off his jacket . It was badly ripped in the back , in the side seams . Huntsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He threw it on the bed . His shirt was wringing wet . Maria kicked off her shoes and sat down in one of the bentwood chairs by the oak pedestal table and put one elbow on the table and let her head keel over against her forearm . The old table sagged in its sad way . Then she straightened up and looked at Sherman . " I want a drink , " she said . " You want one ? " " Yeah . You want me to fix them ? " " Unh-hunh . I want a lot of vodka and a little orange juice and some ice . The vodka 's up in the cabinet . " He went in the mean little kitchen and turned on the light . A cockroach was sitting on the rim of a dirty frying pan on the stove . Well , the hell with it . He made Maria her vodka-and-orange juice and then poured himself an Old Fashioned glass full of scotch and put in some ice and a little water . He sat in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he wanted the drink very badly . He longed for each ice-cold burning jolt in his stomach . The car fishtailed . Thok . The tall delicate one was n't standing there any longer . Maria had already drunk half the big tumbler he had brought her . She closed her eyes and threw her head back and then looked at Sherman and smiled in a tired fashion . " I swear , " she said , " I thought that was gon na he . . . it . " " Well , what do we do now ? " said Sherman . " What do you mean ? " " I guess we ought a  --  I guess we ought a report it to the police . " " That 's what you said . Okay . Tell me what for . " " Well , they tried to rob us  --  and I think maybe you  --  I think it 's possible you hit one of them . " She just looked at him . " It was when you really gunned it , and we skidded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I hope I did . But if I did , I sure did n't hit him very hard . I just barely heard something . " " It was just a little thok . And then he was n't standing there anymore . "  | Maria shrugged her shoulders . " Well  --  I 'm just thinking out loud , " said Sherman . " I think we ought to report it . That way we protect ourselves . " Maria expelled air through her lips , the way you do when you 're at your wit 's end , and looked away . " Well , just suppose the guy is hurt . " She looked at him and laughed softly . " Frankly , I could n't care less . " " But just suppose ? " " Look , we got outta there . How we did it does n't matter . " " But suppose ? " " Suppose bullshit , Sherman . Where you gon na go to tell the police ? What are you gon na say ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sherman , I 'm gon na tell you what happened . I 'm from South Carolina , and I 'm gon na tell you in plain English . Two niggers tried to kill us. and we got away . Two niggers tried to kill us in the jungle , and we got outta the jungle , and we 're still breathing , and that 's that . " " Yeah , but suppose ? " " You suppose ! Suppose you go to the police . What are you gon na say ? What are you gon na say we were doing in the Bronx ? You say you 're just gon na tell them what happened . Well , you tell me , Sherman . What hap-pened ? " So that was what she was actually saying . Do you tell the police that Mrs. Arthur Ruskin of Fifth Avenue and Mr. Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue happened to be having a nocturnal tete-a-tete when they missed the Manhattan off-ramp from the Triborough Bridge and got into a little scrape in the Bronx ? He ran that through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , there was no way he could just tell Judy about a little ride with a woman named Maria . But if they  --  if Maria had hit the boy , then it was better to grit his teeth and just tell what happened . Which was what ? Well . . . two boys had tried to rob them . They blocked the roadway . They approached him . They said . . . A little shock went through his solar plexus . Yol You need some help ? That was all the big one had said . He had n't produced a weapon . Neither of them had made a threatening gesture until after he had thrown the tire . Could it be  --  now , wait a minute . That 's crazy . What else were they doing out on a ramp to an expressway beside a blockade , in the dark  --  except to  --  Maria would back up his interpretation  --  interpretation ! ? a frisky wild animal  --  all of a sudden he realized that he barely knew her .  | " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right . Let 's think about it . I 'm only thinking out loud . " " I do n't have to think about it , Sherman . Some things I understand better than you do . Not many things , but some things . They 'd love to get their hands on you and me . " " Who would ? " " The police . And what good would it do , anyway ? They 'll never catch those boys . " " What do you mean , get their hands on us ? " " Please , forget the police . " " What are you talking about ? " " You , for a start . You 're a socialite . " " I am not a socialite . " Masters of the Universe existed on a plateau far . Move socialites . " Oh no ? Your apartment was in Architectural Digest . Your picture 's n in W. Your father was  --  is  --  well , whatever he is . You know . " " My wife put the apartment in the magazine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police , Sherman . I 'm sure they 'll isppreciate the distinction . " Sherman was speechless . It was a hateful thought . " And they wo n't half mind getting holda me , either , as far as that goes . m just a little girl from South Carolina , but my husband has a hundred illion dollars and an apartment on Fifth Avenue . " " All right , I 'm just trying to figure out the sequence , the things that ight come up , that 's all . What if you did hit the boy  --  what if he 's ' ured ? " " Did you see him get hit ? " " No . " " Neither did I. As far as I 'm concerned , I did n't hit anybody . I hope to .. I did , but as far as I 'm concerned , and as far as you 're concerned , I n't hit anybody . Okay ? " " Well , I guess you 're right . I did n't see anything . But I heard someing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened so fast , you do n't know what happened , and ' they do I. Those boys are n't going to the police . You can be godned sure a that . And if you go to the police , they wo n't find them , her . They 'll just have a good time with your story  --  and you do n't . w what happened , do you ? " " I guess I do n't . " " I guess you do n't , either . If the question ever comes up , all that  | happened was , two boys blocked the road and tried to rob us , and we got away from them . Period . That 's all we know . " " And why did n't we report it ? " " Because it was pointless . We were n't hurt , and we figured they 'd never find those boys , anyway . And you know something , Sherman ? " " What ? " " That happens to be the whole truth . You can imagine anything you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . " " Yeah . You 're right . I do n't know , I 'd just feel better if ? " " You do n't have to feel better , Sherman . I was the one who was driving . If I hit the sonofabitch , then it was me who hit him  --  and I 'm saying I did n't hit anybody , and I 'm not reporting anything to the police . So just do n't you worry about it . " " I 'm not worrying about it , it 's just that ? " " Good . " Sherman hesitated . Well , that was true , was n't it ? She was driving . It was his car , but she took it upon herself to drive it , and if the question ever came up , whatever happened was her responsibility . She was driving . . . and so if there was anything to report , that was her responsibility . too . Naturally , he would stick by her . . . but already a great weight was sliding off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was like something in the jungle . " He nodded several times , to indicate that the truth had finally dawned on him . Maria said , " We coulda been killed , right there , just as easy as not . " " You know something , Maria ? We fought . " " Fought ? " " We were in the goddamned jungle . . . and we were attacked . . . and we fought our way out . " Now he sounded as if the dawn were breaking wider and wider . " Christ , I do n't know when the last time was I was in a fight , an actual fight . Maybe I was twelve , thirteen . You know something , babe ? You were great . You were fantastic . You really were . When I saw you behind the wheel  --  I did n't even know if you could drive the car ! " He was elated . She was driving . " But you drove the hell out of it ! You were great ! " Oh , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't even remember what I did , " said Maria . " It was just a  --  aeverything happened at once . The worst part was getting over into the seat . I do n't know why they put that gearshift thing in the middle there . I caught my skirt on it . "  | " When I saw you there , I could n't believe it ! If you had n't done that " ? he shook his head ? " we'd 've never made it . " Now that they were into the exultation of the war story , Sherman could n't resist giving himself an opening for a little praise . Maria said , " Well , I just did it on  --  I do n't know  --  instinct . " Typical of her ; she did n't notice the opening . " Yeah , " said Sherman , " well , it was a damned good instinct . I kind of had my hands full at that point ! " An opening big enough for a truck . This one even she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . When you threw that wheel , that tire , at that boy  --  oh , God , I thought  --  I just about ? you beat them both . Sherman ! You beat them both ! " O1 I beat them both . Never had there been such music in the ears of the Muster of the Universe . Play on ! Never stop ! " I could n't figure out what was happening ! " said Sherman . Now he was smiling with excitement and not even trying to hold back the smile . " I threw the tire , and all of a sudden it was coming back in my face ! " " That was because he put up his hands to block it , and it bounced off , and ? " They plunged into the thick adrenal details of the adventure . Their voices rose , and their spirits rose , and they laughed , supposedly over the bizarre details of the battle but actually with sheer joy , spontaneous exultation over the miracle . Together they had faced the worst nightmare of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight and began looking at Sherman with her eyes tra wide and her lips parted in the suggestion of a smile . He had a delicious premonition . Without a word she stood up and took off her blouse . She wore nothing underneath it . He stared at her breasts , which were glorious . The fair white flesh was gorged with concupiscence and pItstening with perspiration . She walked over to him and stood between has legs as he sat in the chair and began untying his tie . He put his arms sound her waist and pulled her so hard she lost her balance . They rolled down onto the rug . What a happy , awkward time they had wriggling out Of their clothes ! Now they were stretched out on the floor , on the rug , which was filthy , id the dust balls , and who cared about the dirt and the dust balls ? ey were both hot and wet with perspiration , and who cared about that , * her ? It was better that way . They had been through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungle together , had n't they ? They were king side by side , and their bodies were still hot from the fray . Sherman boxed her on the lips , and they lay like that for a long time , just kissing ,  | with their bodies pressed together . Then he ran his fingers over her back and the perfect curve of her hip and the perfect curve of her thigh and the perfect inside of her thigh  --  and never before such excitement ! The rush ran straight from his fingertips to his groin and then throughout his nervous system to a billion explosive synaptic cells . He wanted to have this woman literally , to enclose her in his very hide , to subsume this hot fair white body of hers , in the prime of youth 's sweet rude firm animal health , and make it his forever . Perfect love ! Pure bliss ! Priapus , king and master ! Master of the Universe ! King of the Jungle ! Sherman kept both his cars , the Mercedes and a big Mercury station wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . At the bottom of the ramp he stopped , as always , beside the wooden cashier 's hut . A chubby little man in a short-sleeved sport shirt and baggy gray twill pants came out the door . It was the one he disliked , Dan , the redheaded one . He got out of the car and quickly rolled up his jacket , hoping the little attendant would n't see it was torn . " Hey , Sherm ! Howya doin ' ? " That was what Sherman truly detested . It was bad enough that this man insisted on calling him by his first name . But to shorten it to Sherm , which no one had ever called him  --  that was escalating presumptuousness into obnoxiousness . Sherman could think of nothing he had ever said , no gesture he had ever made , that had given him the invitation or even the opening to become familiar . Gratuitous familiarity was not the sort of thing you were supposed to mind these days , but Sherman minded it . It was a form of aggression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wasp with the Yale chin , but I will show you . Many times he had tried to think of some polite but cold and cutting response to these hearty pseudo-friendly greetings , and he had come up with nothing . " Sherm , howawya ? " Dan was right beside him . He would n't let up . " Fine , " Mr. McCoy said frostily . . . but also lamely . One of the unwritten rules of status conduct is that when an inferior greets you with a how-are-you , you do not answer the question . Sherman turned to walk away . " Sherm ! " He stopped . Dan was standing beside the Mercedes with his hands on his chubby hips . He had hips like an old woman 's . " You know your coat is ripped ? " The block of ice , his Yale chin jutting out , said nothing .  | " Right there , " said Dan with considerable satisfaction . " You can see the lining . How 'd you do that ? " Sherman could hear it  --  thok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear fishtailing , and the tall skinny boy was no longer standing there . Not a word about that  --  and yet he had a terrific urge to tell this odious little man . Now that he had been through the wall of fire and survived , he was experiencing one of man 's keenest but least understood drives : information compulsion . He wanted to tell his war story . But caution triumphed , caution bolstered by snobbery . He probably should talk to no one about what had happened ; and to this man least of all . " I have no idea , " he said . " You did n't notice it ? " The frosty snowman with the Yale chin , Mr. Sherman McCoy , motioned toward the Mercedes . " I wo n't be taking it out again until the weekend . " Then he did an about-face and left . As he reached the sidewalk , a puff of wind swept the street . He could feel how damp his shirt was . His pants were still damp behind the knees . His ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hair felt like a bird 's nest . He was a mess . His heart was beating a little too fast . I have something to hide . But what was he worrying about ? He was n't driving the car when it happened  --  if it happened . Right ! If it happened . He had n't seen the boy get hit , and she had n't , either , and besides , it was in the heat of a fight for their very lives  --  and she was driving , in any case . If she did n't want to report it , that was her business . He stopped and took a breath and looked around . Yes ; White Manhattan , the sanctuary of the East Seventies . Across the street a doorman stood under the canopy of an apartment house , smoking a cigarette . A boy in a dark business suit and a pretty girl in a white dress were strolling toward him . The fellow was talking to her a mile a minute . So young , and dressed like an old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just the way he had looked when he first went to work at Pierce &; Pierce . All at once a wonderful feeling swept over Sherman . For Christ 's sake , what was he worried about ? He stood there on the sidewalk , stock-still , with his chin up and big grin on his face . The boy and girl probably thought he was a lunatic . In fact  --  he was a man . Tonight , with nothing but his hands and his nerve he had fought the elemental enemy , the hunter , the predator , and he had prevailed . He had fought his way out of an ambush on the nightmare terrain , and he had prevailed . He had saved a woman . The time had come to act like a man , and he had acted and  | prevailed . He was not merely a Master of the Universe ; he was more ; he was a man . Grinning and humming , " Show me but ten who are stouthearted men , " the stouthearted man , still damp from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking the street of dreams .  | / On the mezzanine of the sixth floor of the Bronx County Building , near the elevators , was a wide entryway framed in two or three tons of mahogany and marble and blocked by a counter and a gate . Behind the counter sat a guard with a .38-caliber revolver in a holster on $ his hip . The guard served as a receptionist . The revolver , which looked big enough to stop a florist 's van , was supposed to serve as a deterrent to the random berserk vengeful felons of the Bronx . Over this entryway were some large Roman-style capital letters that had been fabricated in brass at considerable expense to the taxpayers of New York and cemented to the marble facing with epoxy glue . Once a week a handyman got up on a ladder and rubbed Simichrome polish across the letters , so that the legend RICHARD A. WEISS , DISTRICT ATTORNEY , BRONX COUNTY blazed away more brightly than anything the building 's architects , Joseph H. Freedlander and Max Hausle , had the nerve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden dawn half a t century ago . As Larry Kramer got off the elevator and walked toward this brassy gleam , the right side of his lips twisted subversively . The A stood for Abraham . Weiss was known to his friends and his political cronies and the newspaper reporters and Channels 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 11 and his conMtituents , most prominently the Jews and Italians up around Riverdale and the Pelham Parkway and Co-op City , as Abe Weiss . He hated the nickname Abe , which he had been stuck with when he was growing up in  | Brooklyn . A few years back he had let it be known that he preferred to be called Dick , and he had practically been laughed out of the Bronx Democratic organization . That was the last time Abe Weiss ever mentioned Dick Weiss . To Abe Weiss , being laughed out of the Bronx Democratic organization , being separated from it in any fashion whatsoever , for that matter , would have been like being thrown over the railing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he was Richard A. Weiss only in The New York Times and over this doorway . The guard buzzed Kramer through the gate , and Kramer 's running shoes squeaked on the marble floor . The guard gave them a dubious once-over . As usual , Kramer was carrying his leather shoes in an A &P; shopping bag . Beyond the entryway , the level of grandeur in the District Attorney 's Office went up and down . The office of Weiss himself was bigger and showier , thanks to its paneled walls , than the Mayor of New York 's . The bureau chiefs , for Homicide , Investigations , Major Offenses , Supreme Court , Criminal Court , and Appeals , had their share of the paneling and the leather or school-of-leather couches and the Contract Sheraton armchairs . But by the time you got down to an assistant district attorney , like Larry Kramer , you were looking at Good Enough for Government Work when it came to interior decoration . The two assistant district attorneys who shared the office with him , Ray Andriutti and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs . There was just enough floor space in the room for three metal desks , three swivel chairs , four filing cabinets , an old coat stand with six savage hooks sticking out from it , and a table bearing a Mr. Coffee machine and a promiscuous heap of plastic cups and spoons and a gummy collage of paper napkins and white sugar envelopes and pink saccharine envelopes stuck to a maroon plastic tray with a high sweetsmelling paste composed of spilled coffee and Cremora powder . Both Andriutti and Caughey were sitting with their legs crossed in the same fashion . The left ankle was resting on top of the right knee , as if they were such studs , they could n't have crossed their legs any farther if they had wanted to . This was the accepted sitting posture of Homicide , the most manly of the six bureaus of the District Attorney 's Office . Both had their jackets off and hung with the perfect give-a-shit carelessness on the coatrack . Their shirt collars were unbuttoned , and their necktie knots were pulled down an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left arm with his right hand , as if it itched . In fact , he was feeling and admiring his triceps , which he pumped up at least three times  | a week by doing sets of French curls with dumbbells at the New York Athletic Club . Andriutti could afford to work out at the Athletic Club , instead of on a carpet between a Dracaena fragrans tub and a convertible couch , because he did n't have a wife and a child to support in an $888-s-month ant colony in the West Seventies . He did n't have to worry about his triceps and his deltoids and his lats deflating . Andriutti liked the fact that when he reached around behind one of his mighty arms with the other hand , it made the widest muscles of his back , the lats , the latissima dorsae , fan out until they practically split his shirt , and his pectorals hardened into a couple of mountains of pure muscle . Kramer and Andriutti were of the new generation , in which the terms triceps , deltoids , tissima dorsae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the major planets . Andriutti rubbed his triceps a hundred and twenty ' mes a day , on the average . Still rubbing them , Andriutti looked at Kramer as he walked in and said : " Jesus Christ , here comes the bag lady . What the hell is this fucking A &P; bag , Larry ? You been coming in here with this fucking bag every ? ay this week . " Then he turned to Jimmy Caughey and said , " Looks like fucking bag lady . " Caughey was also a jock , but more the Triathlon type , with a narrow ce and a long chin . He just smiled at Kramer , as much as to say , " Well , hat do you say to that ? " Kramer said , " Your arm itch , Ray ? " Then he looked at Caughey and id , " Ray 's got this fucking allergy . It 's called weight lifter 's disease . " hen he turned back to Andriutti . " Itches like a sonofabitch , do n't it ? " Andriutti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are these jogging oes ? " he said to Kramer . " Looks like those girls walking to work at errill Lynch . All dressed up , and they got these fucking rubber guneats on their feet . " " What the hell is in the bag ? " said Caughey . " My high heels , " said Kramer . He took off his jacket and jammed it wn , give-a-shit , on a coatrack hook in the accepted fashion and pulled own his necktie and unbuttoned his shirt and sat down in his swivel air and opened up the shopping bag and fished out his Johnston &; urphy brown leather shoes and started taking off the Nikes . " Jimmy , " Andriutti said to Caughey , " did you know that Jewish guys Larry , I do n't want you to take this personally  --  did you know that wish guys , even if they 're real stand-up guys , all have one faggot gene ? at 's a well-known fact . They ca n't stand going out in the rain without umbrella or they have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to go hunting or they 're for the fucking nuclear freeze and affirmative action or they wear jogging shoes to work or some goddamn thing . You know ? " " Gee , " said Kramer , " I do n't know why you thought I 'd take it personally . " " Come on , Larry , " said Andriutti , " tell the truth . Deep down , do n't you wish you were Italian or Irish ? " " Yeah , " said Kramer , " that way I would n't know what the fuck was going on in this fucking place . " Caughey started laughing . " Well , do n't let Ahab see those shoes , Larry . He 'll have Jeanette issue a fucking memorandum . " " No , he 'll call a fucking press conference , " said Andriutti . " That 's always a safe fucking bet . " And so another fucking day in the fucking Homicide Bureau of the Bronx Fucking District Attorney 's Office was off to a fucking start . An assistant D.A . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and now they all did . Weiss was notorious in his obsession for publicity , even among a breed , the district attorney , that was publicity-mad by nature . Unlike the great D.A.s of yore , such as Frank Hogan , Burt Roberts , or Mario Merola , Weiss never went near a courtroom . He did n't have time . There were only so many hours in the day for him to stay in touch with Channels 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 11 and the New York Daily News , the Post , The City Light , and the Times . Jimmy Caughey said , " I was just in seeing the captain . You shoulda ? " " You were ? What for ? " asked Kramer with just a shade too much curiosity and incipient envy in his voice . " Me and Bernie , " said Caughey . " He wanted to know about the Moore case . " " Any good ? " " Piece a shit , " said Caughey . " This fucking guy Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife 's mother lives there with ' em , and she 's been giving him a hard time for about thirty-seven fucking years , right ' ' So this guy , he loses his job . He 's working for one a these reinsurance companies , and he 's making $200,000 or $300,000 a year , and now he 's out a work for eight or nine months , and nobody 'll hire him , and he do n't know what the hell to do , right ? So one day he 's puttering around out in the garden , and the mother-in-law comes out and says , Well , water seeks its own level . ' That 's a verbatim quote . Water seeks its own level . You ought a get a job as a gardener . ' So this guy , he 's out of his fucking mind .  | ' s so mad . He goes in and tells his wife , ' I 've had it with your mother . I 'm gon na get my shotgun and scare her . ' So he goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shotgun , and he comes downstairs and cads for the mother-in-law , and he 's gon na scare the shit out of her , and e says , Okay , Gladys , ' and he trips on the rug , and the gun goes off and kills her , and  --  ba-bing ! ? Murder Two . " " Why was Weiss interested ? " " Well , the guy 's white , he 's got some money , he lives in a big house in Riverdale . It looks at first like maybe he 's gon na fake an accidental ooting . " " Is that possible ? " " Naw . Fucking guy 's one a my boys . He 's your basic Irish who made sod , but he 's still a Harp . He 's drowning in remorse . You 'd think he 'd of his own mother , he feels so fucking guilty . Right now he 'd confess to ything . Bernie could sit him in front of the videocamera and clean up ery homicide in the Bronx for the past five years . Naw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked good at first . " Kramer and Andriutti contemplated this piece a shit without needing y amplification . Every assistant D.A . in the Bronx , from the youngest ian just out of St. John 's Law School to the oldest Irish bureau chief , ho would be somebody like Bernie Fitzgibbon , who was forty-two , ared Captain Ahab 's mania for the Great White Defendant . For a rt , it was not pleasant to go through life telling yourself , " What I do ? r a living is , I pack blacks and Latins off to jail . " Kramer had been ' sed as a liberal . In Jewish families like his , liberalism came with the ' milac and the Mott 's apple juice and the Instamatic and Daddy 's grins the evening . And even the Italians , like Ray Andriutti , and the Irish , e Jimmy Caughey , who were not exactly burdened with liberalism by eir parents , could n't help but be affected by the mental atmosphere of e law schools , where , for one thing , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you finished law school in the New York area , it : , well . . . impolite ! . . . on the ordinary social level . . . to go and making jokes about the yours . It was n't that it was morally wrong .. It was that it was in bad taste . So it made the boys uneasy , this ernal prosecution of the blacks and Latins . Not that they were n't guilty . One thing Kramer had learned within o weeks as an assistant D.A . in the Bronx was that 95 percent of the fendants who got as far as the indictment stage , perhaps 98 percent , re truly guilty . The caseload was so overwhelming , you did n't waste e trying to bring the marginal cases forward , unless the press was on  | your back . They hauled in guilt by the ton , those blue-and-orange vans out there on Walton Avenue . But the poor bastards behind the wire mesh barely deserved the term criminal . if by criminal you had in mind the romantic notion of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some desperate way outside the law . No , they were simpleminded incompetents , most of them , and they did unbelievably stupid , vile things . Kramer looked at Andriutti and Caughey , sitting there with their mighty thighs akimbo . He felt superior to them . He was a graduate of the Columbia Law School , and they were both graduates of St. John 's , widely known as the law school for the also-rans of college academic competition . And he was Jewish . Very early in life he had picked up the knowledge that the Italians and the Irish were animals . The Italians were pigs , and the Irish were mules or goats . He could n't remember if his parents had actually used any such terms or not , but they got the idea across very clearly . To his parents , New York City  --  New York ? hell , the whole U.S. , the whole world ! ? was a drama called The Jews Confront the Goyirn , and the goyim were animals . And so what was he doing here with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare thing . The Homicide Bureau was the elite corps of the District Attorney 's Office , the D.A . ' s Marines , because homicide was the most serious of all crimes . An assistant D.A . in Homicide had to he able to go out on the street to the crime scenes at all hours , night and day , and be a real commando and rub shoulders with the police and know how to confront defendants and witnesses and intimidate them when the time came , and these were likely to he the lowest , grimmest , scurviest defendants and witnesses in the history of criminal justice . For fifty years , at least , maybe longer , Homicide had been an Irish enclave , although recently the Italians had made their way into it . The Irish had given Homicide their stamp . The Irish were stone courageous . Even when it was insane not to , they never stepped hack . Andriutti had been right , or half right . Kramer did n't want to be Italian , but he did want to be Irish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , they were animals ! The goyim were animals , and Kramer was proud to he among the animals , in the Homicide Bureau . Anyway , here they were , the three of them , sitting in this Good Enough for Government Work office at $36,000 to $42,000 a year instead of down at Cravath , Swaine &; Moore or some such place at $136,000 to $142,000 . They had been born a million miles from Wall Street , meaning the outer boroughs , Brooklyn , Queens , and the Bronx . To their families , their going to college and becoming lawyers had been the greatest thing  | since Franklin D. Roosevelt . And so they sat around in the Homicide Bureau talking about this fucking thing and that fucking thing and using don'ts for doesn'ts and naws for no 's , as if they did n't know any better . Here they were . . . and here he was , and where was he going ? What were these cases he was handling ? Pieces of shit ! Garbage collection . . . Arthur Rivera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over an order of pizza at a social club and pull knives , and Arthur says , " Let 's put the weapons down and fight man to man . " And they do , whereupon Arthur pulls out a second knife and stabs the other fellow in the chest and kills him . . . Jimmy Dollard . Jimmy Dollard and his closest pal , Otis Blakemore , and three other black guys are drinking and taking cocaine and playing a game called the dozens , in which the idea is to see how outrageously you can insult the other fellow , and Blakemore is doing an inspired number on Jimmy , and Jimmy pulls out a revolver and shoots him through the heart and then collapses on the table , sobbing and saying , " My man ! My man Stan ! I shot my man Stan ! " . . . And the case of Herbert 92X For an instant the thought of Herbert 's case triggered a vision of the girl with brown lipstick The press could n't even see these cases . It was just poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be part of the garbagecollection service , necessary and honorable , plodding and anonymous . Captain Ahab was n't so ridiculous , after all . Press coverage ! Ray and Jimmy could laugh all they wanted , but Weiss had made sure the entire city knew his name . Weiss had an election coming up , and the Bronx was 70 percent black and Latin , and he was going to make sure the name Abe Weiss was pumped out to them on every channel that existed . He might not do much else , but he was going to do that . A telephone rang : Ray 's . " Homicide , " he said . " Andriutti . . . Bernie 's not here . I think he 's in court . . . What ? . . . Go over that again ? " Long pause . " Well , was he hit by a car or was n't he ? . . . Unnhhunnh . . . Well , shit , I do n't know . You better talk it over with Bernie . Okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head and looked at Jimmy Caughey . " That was some detective who 's over at Lincoln Hospital . Says they got a likely-to-die , some kid who comes into the emergency room and do n't know whether he slipped in the bathtub and broke his wrist or got hit by a Mercedes-Benz . Or some such shit . Wants to talk to Bernie . So let him fucking talk to Bernie . " Ray shook his head some more , and Kramer and Caughey nodded sympathetically . The eternal pieces a shit in the Bronx .  | Kramer looked at his watch and stood up . " Well , " he said , " you guys can sit here and fuck-all , if you want , but I got ta go fucking listen to that renowned Middle Eastern scholar Herbert 92X read from the Koran . " There were thirty-five courtrooms in the Bronx County Building devoted to criminal cases , and each one was known as a " part . " They had been built at a time , the early 1930s , when it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravity and omnipotence of the rule of law . The ceilings were a good fifteen feet high . The walls were paneled throughout in a dark wood . The judge 's bench was a stage with a vast desk . The desk had enough cornices , moldings , panels , pilasters , inlays , and sheer hardwood mass to make you believe that Solomon himself , who was a king , would have found it imposing . The seats in the spectators ' section were separated from the judge 's bench , the jury box , and the tables of the prosecutor , the defendant , and the clerk of the court by a wooden balustrade with an enormous carved top rail , the so-called Bar of Justice . In short , there was nothing whatsoever in the look of the premises to tip off the unwary to the helter-skelter of a criminal court judge 's daily task . The moment Kramer walked in , he could tell that the day had gotten off to a bad start in Part 60 . He had only to look at the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black robes , leaning forward with both forearms on his desktop . His chin was down so low it seemed about to touch it . His bony skull and his sharp beak jutted out of the robe at such a low angle he looked like a buzzard . Kramer could see his irises floating and bobbing on the whites of his eyes as he scanned the room and its raggedy collection of humanity . He looked as if he were about to flap his wings and strike . Kramer felt ambivalent about Kovitsky . On one hand , he resented his courtroom tirades , which were often personal and designed to humiliate . On the other hand , Kovitsky was a Jewish warrior , a son of the Masada . Only Kovitsky could have stopped the loudmouths in the prison vans with a gob of spit . " Where 's Mr. Sonnenberg ? " said Kovitsky . There was no response . So he said it again , this time in an amazing baritone that nailed every syllable into the back wall and startled all newcomers to the courtroom of Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for two little boys and a little girl , who were running between the benches and playing tag , the spectators froze . One by one they congratulated themselves . No matter how miserable their fates , at least they  | had not fallen so low as to be Mr. Sonnenberg , that miserable insect , whoever he was . That miserable insect was a lawyer , and Kramer knew the nature of his offense , which was that his absence was impeding the shoveling of the chow into the gullet of the criminal justice system , Part 60 . In each part , the day began with the so-called calendar session , during which the judge dealt with motions and pleas in a variety of cases , perhaps as many as a dozen in a morning . Kramer had to laugh every time he saw a television show with a courtroom scene . They always showed a trial in progress . A trial ! Who the hell dreamed up these goddamned shows ? Every year there were 7,000 felony indictments in the Bronx and the capacity for 650 trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other 6,350 cases in either of two ways . They could dismiss a case or they could let the defendant plead guilty to a reduced charge in return for not forcing the court to go through a trial . Dismissing cases was a hazardous way to go about reducing the backlog , even for a grotesque cynic . Every time a felony case was thrown out , somebody , such as the victim or his family , was likely to yell , and the press was only too happy to attack judges who let the malefactors go free . That left the plea bargains , which were the business of the calendar sessions . So the calendar sessions were the very alimentary canal of the criminal justice system in the Bronx . Every week the clerk of each part turned in a scorecard to Louis Mastroiani , chief administrative judge for the criminal division , Supreme Court , Bronx County . The scorecard showed how many cases the judge iu that part had on his docket and how many he had disposed of that week , through plea bargains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtroom , over the judge 's head , it said IN GOD WE TRUST . On the scorecard , however , it said CASE BACKLOG ANALYSIS , and a judge 's effectiveness was rated almost entirely according to CASE BACKLOG ANALYSIS . Practically all cases were called for 9:30 a.m . If the clerk called a case , and the defendant was not present or his lawyer was not present or if any of a dozen other things occurred to make it impossible to shove this case a little farther through the funnel , the principals in the next case would be on hand , presumably , ready to step forward . So the spectators ' section was dotted with little clumps of people , none of them spectators in any sporting sense . There were defendants and their lawyers , defendants and their pals , defendants and their families . The three small children came slithering out from between two benches , ran toward the back of the courtroom , giggling , and disappeared behind the last bench . A woman  | turned her head and scowled at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kramer recognized the trio . They were Herbert 92X 's children . Not that he found this at all remarkable ; there were children in the courtrooms every day . The courts were a form of day-care center in the Bronx . Playing tag in Part 60 during Daddy 's motions , pleas , trials , and sentencings was just a part of growing up . Kovitsky turned toward the clerk of the court , who sat at a table below the judge 's bench and off to the side . The clerk was a bull-necked Italian named Charles Bruzzielli . He had his jacket off . He wore a short-sleeved dress shirt with the collar open and his necktie at half-mast . You could see the top of his T-shirt . The tie had a huge Windsor knot . " Is that Mr. . . . " Kovitsky looked down at a piece of paper on his desk , then at Bruzzielli . " . . . Lockwood ? " Bruzzielli nodded yes , and Kovitsky looked straight ahead at a slender figure who had walked from the spectators ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Kovitsky , " where 's your attorney ? Where 's Mr. Sonnenberg ? " " I ' unno , " said the figure . He was barely audible . He was no more than nineteen or twenty . He had dark skin . He was so thin there was no sign of shoulders under his black thermal jacket . He wore black stovepipe jeans and a pair of huge white sneakers that closed with Velcro tabs rather than shoelaces . Kovitsky stared at him a moment , then said , " All right , Mr. Lockwood , you take a seat . If and when Mr. Sonnenberg deigns to favor us with his presence , we 'll call your case again . " Lockwood turned around and began walking back to the spectators ' benches . He had the same pumping swagger that practically every young defendant in the Bronx affected , the Pimp Roll . Such stupid self-destructive macho egos , thought Kramer . They never failed to show up with the black jackets and the sneakers and the Pimp Roll . They never failed to look every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , court psychiatrists , before every single soul who had any say in whether or not they went to prison or for how long . Lockwood pimp-rolled to a bench in the rear of the spectators ' section and sat down next to two more boys in black thermal jackets . These were no doubt his buddies , his comrades . The defendant 's comrades always arrived in court in their shiny black thermal jackets and go-to-hell sneakers . That was very bright , too . That immediately established the fact that the defendant was not a poor defenseless victim of life in the ghetto but part of a pack of remorseless young felons of the sort who liked to knock down old ladies  | with Lucite canes on the Grand Concourse and steal their handbags . The whole pack entered the courtroom full of juice , bulging with steel mus ' cles and hard jawed defiance , ready to defend the honor and , if necessary , the hides of their buddies against the System . But soon a stupefying tide I of tedium and confusion rolled over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not primed for what the day required , which was waiting while something they never heard of , a calendar session , swamped them in a lot of shine-on language , such as " deigns to favor us with his presence . " Kramer walked past the bar and headed over to the clerk 's table . Three other assistant D.A . ' s stood there , looking on and waiting their turns before the judge . The clerk said , " The People versus Albert and Marilyn Krin ? " He hesitated and looked down at the papers before him . He looked at a young woman standing three or four feet away , an assistant district attorney named Patti Stullieri , and he said in a stage whisper , " What the hell is this ? " Kramer looked over his shoulder . The document said , " Albert and Marilyn Krnkka . " " Kri-nick-a , " said Patti Stullieri . " Albert and Marilyn Kri-nick-a ! " he declaimed . " Indictment number 3-2-8-1 . " Then to Patti Stullieri : " Jesus , what the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yugoslay . " " Yugoslay . It looks like somebody 's fingers got caught in a fucking typewriter . " From the rear of the spectators ' section , a couple came marching up to the great railing and leaned forward . The man , Albert Krnkka , smiled in a bright-eyed fashion and seemed to want to engage the attention of Judge Kovitsky . Albert Krnkka was a tall , gangling man with a five-inch goatee but no mustache at all and long blond hair like an old-fashioned rock musician 's . He had a bony nose , a long neck , and an Adam 's apple that seemed to move up and down a foot when he swallowed . He wore a 1-green shirt with an outsized collar and , in place of buttons , a zipper that ran diagonally from his left shoulder to the right side of his waist . Beside him was his wife . Marilyn Krnkka was a black-haired woman with a thin , delicate face . Her eyes were two slits . She kept compressing her lips and grimacing . Everyone , Judge Kovitsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked toward the Krnkkas , expecting their lawyer to come forward  | or come in through the side door or materialize in some fashion . But there was no lawyer . Furious , Kovitsky turned toward Bruzzielli and said , " Who 's representing these people ? " " I think Marvin Sunshine , " said Bruzzielli . " Well , where is he ? I saw him back there a few minutes ago . What 's gotten into all these characters ? " Bruzzielli gave him the Primordial Shrug and rolled his eyes , as if the whole thing pained him tremendously but there was nothing he could do about it . Kovitsky 's head was now down very low . His irises were floating like destroyers on a lake of white . But before he could launch into a blistering discourse on delinquent lawyers , a voice spoke up from the bar . " Your Honor ! Your Honor ! Hey , Judge ! " It was Albert Krnkka . He was waving his right hand , trying to get Kovitsky 's attention . His arms were thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mouth hung open in a half smile that was supposed to convince the judge that he was a reasonable man . In fact , he looked , every inch of him , like one of those wild tall raw-boned men whose metabolisms operate at triple speed and who , more than any other people on earth , are prone to explosions . " Hey Judge ! Look " , . Kovitsky stared , amazed by this performance . " Hey , Judge ! Look . Two weeks ago she told us two to six , right ? " When Albert Krnkka said " two to six , " he raised both hands up in the air and stuck out two fingers on each hand , like a v for victory or a peace sign , and flailed them in the air , as if he were beating a pair of invisible aerial drums in time to the phrase " two to six . " " Mr. Krnkka , " said Kovitsky , rather softly for him . " And now she 's coming in ' ere wit ' three to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Okay , two to six ' " ? once again he raised his hands and the pair of v ' s and beat the air in time to " two to six " ? " and she 's coming in ' ere wit ' three to nine . Two to six " ? he beat the air ? " two to six ? " " MIS-TER KRI-NICK-A , IF YOU ? " But Albert Krnkka was unbowed by Judge Kovitsky 's hammering voice . " Two to six " ? blam , blam , blam ? " you got it ! " " MIS-TER KRI-NICK-A . If you want to petition the court , you must do so through your attorney . "  | " Hey , Judge , you ask her ! " He stabbed his left forefinger toward Patti Stullieri . His arm seemed a mile long . " She 's the one . She offered two to six , Judge . Now she come in here wit ' ? " " Mister Krnkka ? " " Two to six , Judge , two to six ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , Albert Krnkka now compressed his message into its key phrase , all the while beating the air with his huge hands . " Two to six ! You got it ! Two to six ! You got it ! " " Mister Krnkka . . . sIDDOWN ! Wait for your attorney . " Albert Krnkka and his wife began backing away from the bar , looking at Kovitsky the whole time , as if leaving a throne room . Albert kept mouthing the words " two to six " and waving his v fingers . Larry Kramer moved over to where Patti Stullieri was standing and said , " What did they do ? " Patti Stullieri said , " The wife held a knife to a girl 's throat while the husband raped her . " " Jesus , " said Kramer , in spite of himself . Patti Stullieri smiled in a world-weary fashion . She was twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old . Kramer wondered if she was worth making a play for . She was not a looker , but her Hard Number pose turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like in high school . He wondered if she had been one of those thin nervous skanks who were always irritable and difficult and lacking in femininity without being strong . On the other hand , she had the olive skin , the thick black hair , the big dark eyes , the Cleopatra lips that in Kramer 's mind added up to the Italian Dirty Girl look . In high school  --  Jesus , those Italian Dirty Girls ! ? Kramer had always found them gross , stupid beyond belief , antitellectual , unapproachable , and intensely desirable . The door to the courtroom swung open , and in walked an old man with a large , florid , rather lordly head . Debonair , that was the word . Or t least he was debonair by the standards of Gibraltar . He wore a navyue double-breasted pinstripe suit , a white shirt with a starched collar , a dark red necktie . His black hair , which was thin and had the inky Ilness of a dye job , was combed straight back and plastered down on skull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ck line on either side of the gully under his nose . Larry Kramer , who was standing near the clerk 's desk , looked up and red . He knew the man . There was something charming  --  no , braveut his style . At the same time , it made you shiver . This man had once , as Kramer was now , an assistant district attorney . Bing ! Bing !  | Bing ! Thirty years had gone by , and here he was finishing out his career 1 in private practice , representing these poor incompetents , including the 18-b 's , the ones who could n't afford lawyers . Bing ! Bing ! Bing ! Not a very long time , thirty years ! Larry Kramer was n't the only one who stopped and stared . The man 's I ' entrance was an event . His chin was the shape of a melon . He held it 11 cocked up at a self-satisfied angle , as if he were a boulevardier , as if the Grand Concourse could still be called a boulevard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Kovitsky . He seemed pleasantly surprised that his arrival should occasion such a hearty greeting . " We called your case five minutes ago ! " " I apologize , Your Honor , " said Sonnenberg , sauntering up to the defendant 's desk . He swung his great chin upward in an elegant arc toward the judge . " I was held over in Part 62 by Judge Meldnick . " " Whaddaya doing with a case in Part 62 when you knew this court was putting you at the top of the calendar as a personal accommodation : ' Your client Mr. Lockwood has a job , as I recall . " " That 's correct , Your Honor , but I was assured ? " " Your client is here . " " I know . " " He 's waiting for you . " " I 'm aware of that , Your Honor , but I had no idea that Judge Meldnick ? " " All right , Mr. Sonnenberg , are you ready to proceed now ? " " Yes , Your Honor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The black youth . Lockwood , got up from the spectators ' section and came pimp-rolling up to the defendant 's desk , beside Sonnenberg . It soon became apparent that the purpose of this hearing was to allow Lockwood to plead guilty to the charge , which was armed robbery , in return for a light sentence , two to six years , offered by the District Attorney 's Office . But Lockwood was n't going for it . All that Sonnenberg could do was reiterate his client 's plea of not guilty . Kovitsky said , " Mr. Sonnenberg , would you approach the bench . please ? And Mr. Torres ? " Torres was the assistant district attorney on the case . He was short and quite fat , even though he was barely thirty years old . He had the sort cal mustache that young lawyers and doctors wear to try to look older and graver .  | As Sonnenberg drew near , Kovitsky said , in an amiable , conversational tone , " You look just like David Niven today , Mr. Sonnenberg . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David Niven I 'm not . William Powell maybe , but not David Niven . " " William Powell ? You 're dating yourself , Mr. Sonnenberg . You 're not that old , are you ? " Kovitsky turned to Torres and said , " The next thing we know , Mr. Sonnenberg 's gon na be leaving us for the Sun Belt . He 's gon na be down there in a condominium , and all he 'll have to worry about is getting to the shopping mall in time for the Early Bird special at Denny 's . He wo n't even have to think about getting up in the morning and making pleas in Part 60 in the Bronx . " " Listen , Judge , I swear ? " " Mr. Sonnenberg , do you know Mr. Torres ? " " Oh yes . " " Well , Mr. Torres understands about condominiums and Early Bird specials . He 's half a Yiddeleh himself . " " Yeah ? " Sonnenberg did n't know whether he was supposed to appear pleased or what . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Yiddeleh . Right , Mr. Torres ? " Torres smiled and shrugged , trying to appear appropriately amused . " So he used his Yiddisheh kop and applied for a minority scholarship to law school , " said Kovitsky . " His Yiddisheh half applied for a minority scholarship for his Puerto Rican half ! Is that One World or is n't it ? It 's using your fucking kop , anyway . " Kovitsky looked at Sonnenberg until he smiled , and then he looked at Torres until he smiled , and then Kovitsky beamed at both of them . Why had he turned so jolly all of a sudden ? Kramer looked over at the defendant , Lockwood . He was standing at the defendant 's table and staring at this jolly threesome . What must be going through his mind ? His fingertips rested on the table , and his chest seemed to have caved in . His eyes ! His eyes were the eyes of the hunted in the night . He stared at the spectacle of his lawyer grinning and chuckling with the judge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling and jabbering with the white judge and the fat white prick who was trying to put him away . Sonnenberg and Torres were both standing at the bench , looking up at Kovitsky . Now Kovitsky got down to work . " What have you offered him , Mr. Torres ? " " Two to six , Judge . " " What 's your client say , Mr. Sonnenberg ? "  | " He wo n't take it , Judge . I talked to him last week , and I talked to him this morning . He wants to go to trial . " " Why ? " asked Kovitsky . " Did you explain to him that he 'll be eligible for work release in a year ? It 's not a bad deal . " " Well , " said Sonnenberg , " the problem is , as Mr. Torres knows , my client 's a Y.O . That one was for the same thing , armed robbery , and if he pleads guilty to this one , then he 's got ta serve time for that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , what will he take ? " " He 'll take one and a half to four and a half , with the sentence for the first one subsumed under this one . " " What about it , Mr. Torres ? " The young assistant district attorney sucked in his breath and lowered his eyes and shook his head . " I ca n't do it , Judge . We 're talking about armed robbery ! " " Yeah , I know , " said Kovitsky , " but was he the one with the gun ? " " No , " said Torres . Kovitsky lifted his eyes from the faces of Sonnenberg and Ton-es and looked out at Lockwood . " He does n't look like a bad kid , " said Kovitsky , for Torres 's benefit . " In fact , he looks like a baby . I see these kids in here every day . They 're easily led . They live in some kinda shithook neighborhood , and they end up doing stupid things . What 's he like , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Judge , " said Sonnenberg . " The kid 's a follower . He 's no brain surgeon , but he 's no hard case , either . Not in my opinion . " This personality profile was evidently supposed to wear Torres down into offering Lockwood a sentence of only one and a third to four years , with his Y.O . conviction in effect forgotten . Y.O . stood for " youthful offender . " " Look , Judge , it 's no use , " Torres said . " I ca n't do it . Two to six is as low as I can go . My office ? " " Why do n't you call Frank ? " asked Kovitsky . " It 's no use , Judge . We 're talking about armed robbery ! He may not 've held a gun on the victim , but that was because he was going through his pockets with both hands ! A sixty-nine-year-old man with a stroke . Walks like this . " Torres did a shuffle in front of the bench , gimping along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " That 's the Yiddeleh coming out ! Mr. Torres has Illpisome of Ted Lewis 's chromosomes and does n't even know it . "  | " Ted Lewis was Jewish ? " asked Sonnenberg . " Why not ? " said Kovitsky . " He was a comedian , was n't he ? Okay , Mr. Torres , calm down . " ' Torres came back to the bench . " The victim , Mr. Borsalino , says he broke a rib . We 're not even charging him with that , because the old man never went to see a doctor about the rib . No , two to six is it . " Kovitsky thought that over . " Did you explain that to your client ? " " Sure I did , " said Sonnenberg . He shrugged and made a face , as if to say his client would n't listen to reason . " He 's willing to take his chances . " " Take his chances ? " said Kovitsky . " But he signed a confession . " Sonnenberg made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me talk to him . " Sonnenberg screwed up his lips and rolled his eyes , as if to say , " Good luck . " Kovitsky looked up again and stared at Lockwood and stuck his chin up in the air and said , " Son . . . come here . " The boy stood at the table , frozen , not altogether sure the judge was talking to him and not somebody else . So Kovitsky put on a smile , the smile of the benevolent leader , He Who Is Willing to Be Patient , and he beckoned with his right hand and said , " Come on up here , son . I want to talk to you . " The boy , Lockwood , started walking , slowly , warily , up to where Sonnenberg and Torres were standing and looked at Kovitsky . The look he gave him was completely empty . Kovitsky stared back . It was like looking at a small empty house at night with all the lights out . " Son , " said Kovitsky , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You look like a nice young man . Now , I want you to give yourself a chance . I 'll give you a chance , but first you 've got to give yourself a chance . " Then Kovitsky stared into Lockwood 's eyes as if what he was about to iay were one of the most important things he was likely to hear in his ' fetime . " Son , " he said , " whaddaya wan na get involved in all these fucking bberies for ? " Lockwood 's lips moved , but he fought the impulse to say anything , perhaps for fear he might incriminate himself . " What does your mother say ? You live with your mother ? " Lockwood nodded yes . " What does your mother say ? She ever hit you upside the head ? "  | " Naw , " said Lockwood . His eyes appeared misty . Kovitsky took this as a sign that he was making progress . " Now , son , " he said , " do you have a job ? " Lockwood nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Security guard , " said Kovitsky . He stared off at a blank spot on the wall , as if pondering the implication for society of that answer , and then decided to stick to the issue at hand . " See ? " said KovitskY " You 've got a job , you 've got a home , you 're young , you 're a nice-looking , bright young man . You 've got a lot going for you . You 've got more than most people . But you 've got one big problem to overcome . YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE FUCKING ROBBERIES ! Now , the district attorney has made you an offer of two to six years . If you take that offer and you behave yourself , this will all be behind you in no time and you 'll still be a young man with your whole life ahead of you . If you go to trial and you 're convicted , you could get eight to twenty-five . Now think about that . The district attorney has made you an offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " kd Kitk yon youae aseovsy . " No reason . " " No reason ? " Lockwood looked away . He was n't going to parry words . He was just going to hold tight . " Look , son , " said Kovitsky , " I 'm trying to help you . This thing wo n't go away . You ca n't just close your eyes and hope it 's all gon na disappear . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? " Lockwood kept looking down or to the side , always a few inches away from eye contact with the judge . Kovitsky kept moving his head as if to intercept him , like a hockey goalie . " Look at me , son . Do you understand ? " Lockwood gave in and looked at him . It was the sort of look a firing squad might expect to see . " Now , son , think of it this way . It 's like having cancer . You know about cancer . " There was n't a glimmer of comprehension of cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , either . You have to do something about If you catch it early , while it 's small , before it spreads through your whole body and takes over your whole life  --  and ruins your life  --  and  | ends your life  --  you understand ? ? ends your life  --  if you do something about it while it 's a small problem , if you have the small operation you need , then that 's it ! " Kovitsky threw his hands up in the air and lifted his chin and smiled , as if he were the very personification of buoyancy . " Now , it 's the same way with the problem you have now . Right now it 's a small problem . If you plead guilty and receive a sentence of two to six years and you behave yourself , you 'll be eligible for a work-release program after one year and full parole after two years . And it 'll all be behind you . But if you go to trial and you 're found guilty , then your minimum sentence will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eight ? you 're only nineteen now . Eight years , that 's almost half as long as you 've been on this earth . You wan na spend your whole fucking youth in jail ? " Lockwood averted his eyes . He did n't say one thing or the other . " So how about it ? " asked Kovitsky . Without looking up , Lockwood shook his head no . " All right , if you 're innocent , I do n't want you to plead guilty , no matter what anybody offers you . But you signed a confession ! The district ' attorney has a videotape of you making that confession ! Whaddaya gon na do about that ? " " I ' unno , " said Lockwood . " What does your attorney say ? " " I ' unno . " " Come on , son . Of course you know . You have an excellent attorney . ' s one of the best , Mr. Sonnenberg is . He has a lot of experience . You ten to him . He 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na go away , any More than cancer 's gon na go away . " Lockwood kept looking down . Whatever his lawyer and the judge and 1br D.A . had cooked up , he was n't buying it . t " Look , son , " said Kovitsky , " talk it over some more with your attor0ey . Talk it over with your mother . What does your mother say ? " ' Lockwood looked up with live hatred . Tears began to form in his eyes . was very touchy business , talking to these boys about their mothers . t Kovitsky stared right at him . " All right , Counselor ! " said Kovitsky , raising his voice and looking r toward Sonnenberg . " And , Mr. Torres . I 'm postponing this until weeks from today . And , son , " he said to Lockwood , " you think over t I told you , and you confer with Mr. Sonnenberg , and you make up pur mind . Okay ? " Lockwood gave Kovitsky one last flicker of a glance and nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectators ' section . Sonnet ) berg walked with him and said something , but Lockwood made no re sponse . When he passed the railing and saw his buddies getting up from the last bench , Lockwood began pimp-rolling . Outta here ! Back to . . the Life ! The three of them pimp-rolled out of the courtroom , with Son nenberg sauntering behind , his chin cocked up at a thirty-degree angle . The morning was grinding on , and so far Kovitsky had n't disposed of a single case . It was late in the morning when Kovitsky finally worked his wa through the calendar and reached the trial of Herbert 92X , which was now in its fourth day . Kramer was standing by the prosecution table . The court officers were rotating their shoulder sockets and stretching and otherwise readying themselves for the arrival of Herbert 92X , whom the considered enough of a maniac to do something stupid and violent in the courtroom . Herbert 92X 's lawyer , Albert Teskowitz , appointed by the court , walked over from the defense table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaid jacket that rode three or four inches off his neck and a pair of brown slacks that had never been introduced to the jacket . His thinning gray hair was the color of dry ice . He flashed Kramer a screwy little smile that as much as declared , " The charade is about to begin . " " Well , Larry , " he said , " are you ready for the wisdom of Allah ? " " Let me ask you something , " said Kramer . " Does Herbert select this stuff every day with the idea that it makes some kind of comment on what 's going on in the case , or does he just open the book ? I ca n't tell . " " I do n't know , " said Teskowitz . " I stay off the subject , to tell you the truth . Just mention it , and it 's an hour out of your life . You ever talk to , . logical lunatic before ? They 're much worse ' than a plain lunatic . " Teskowitz was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But . then , he felt sorry for him , anyway . Herbert 92X 's legal name was Her bert Cantrell ; 92X was his Muslim name . He was a driver for a liquor distributor . That was one of a number of things that made Kramer he lieve he was n't a real Muslim . A real Muslim would n't have anything to do with liquor . In any case , one day Herbert 's truck was hijacked on Willis Avenue by three Italians from Brooklyn who had done little else for the past decade but hijack trucks for whoever was paying for lip jacking trucks . They pulled guns on Herbert , tied him up , gave him . t punch in the face , threw him into a dumpster on a side street , and warned him not to move for an hour . Then the three Italians drove the  | liquor truck to the warehouse of their employer of the moment , a wiseguy liquor distributor who routinely cut costs by hijacking merchandise . They drove up with the hijacked truck , and the loading-dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lotta trouble ! That 's one a our trucks ! " " Whaddaya mean ? " " That 's one a our trucks ! I just loaded it two hours ago ! You 're boostfig stuff we just got through boosting ! You just worked over one a our guys ! You 're in a lotta trouble ! " So the three Italians jumped into the truck and sped to the dumpster to give Herbert 92X back his truck . But Herbert had managed to get out . They started driving up and down the streets in the truck , looking for him . They finally found him in a bar where he had gone to steady his nerves . This was definitely not the Muslim way . They came walking in to tell him they were sorry and that he could have his truck back , but Herbert thought they were coming after him because he had ignored their warning to stay in the dumpster . So he pulled a .38-caliber revolver out from under his thermal jacket  --  it had been there all along , but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fired two shots . He missed the three Italians but hit and killed a man named Nestor Cabrillo , who had come in to make a telephone call . The firearm was perhaps a Necessary item of defense in what was obviously a hazardous occupation . Put he was not licensed to carry it , and Nestor Cabrillo was an upstanding citizen with five children . So Herbert was charged with manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon , and the case had to be prosecuted , ind Kramer was stuck with that task . The case was a study in stupidity , mpetence , and uselessness ; in short , a piece a shit . Herbert 92X red to accept a plea bargain , since he regarded what had happened as accident . He was only sorry that the .38 had jerked his hand around So this piece a shit had now gone to trial . A door off to the side of the judge 's bench opened , and out came bert 92X and two corrections officers . The Corrections Department the detention pens , which were some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 92X was a tall man . His eyes shone out of shadow of a checked Yasir Arafat-style headgear that hung over his head . He wore a brown gown that came down to his calves . Below gown you could see cream-colored pants , whose lapped side seams contrasting stitching , and a pair of brown Tuczek-toed shoes . His ds were behind his back . When the corrections officers turned him  | around to unlock his handcuffs , Kramer could see that he was holding the Koran . " Yo , Herbert ! " The voice of a cheery little boy . It was one of the children , up by the bar . The court officers glowered at him . A woman back in the spectator benches yelled out , " You come here ! " The little bo laughed and ran back to where she was sitting . Herbert stopped and turned toward the boy . His furious visage dissolved . He gave the boy a wide-eyed smile of such warmth and love , it caused Kramer to swallow ? and to have another small spasm of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clerk , Bruzzielli , said , " The People versus Herbert Cantrell , Indictment Number 2-7-7-7 . " Herbert 92X was on his feet with his hand in the air . " He called me out of my name again ! " Kovitsky leaned forward over his desk and said patiently , " Mr. 92X , III , explained this to you yesterday and the day before yesterday and the day before that . " " He called me out of my name ! " " I explained this to you , Mr. 92X . The clerk is bound by a legal requirement . But in view of your evident intention to change your name , which is your right , and for which legal process exists , the court is content to refer to you as Herbert 92X for the purpose of these proceedings . That okay with you ? " " Thank you , Your Honor , " said Herbert 92X , still standing . He opened the Koran and began riffling through the pages . " This morning , Your Honor ? " " Can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Then sid-down ! " Herbert 92X stared at Kovitsky for a moment , then sank down into seat , still holding the Koran open . Somewhat sulkily he said : " You gon na let me read ? " Kovitsky looked at his wristwatch and nodded yes and then swiveled away about forty-five degrees and gazed at the wall above the empty ju box . Seated , Herbert 92X placed the Koran on the defense table and sal " This morning , Your Honor , I shall read from Chapter 41 , entitled ' A Distinctly Explained , Revealed at Mecca ' . . . in the name of the M ( Merciful God . . This is a revelation from the Most Merciful . . Warn them of the day on which the enemies of God shall be gathered  | together unto hellfire and shall march in distinct bands until , when they shall arrive thereat , their ears and their eyes and their skins shall bear witness against them . . . " The court officers were rolling their eyes up in their heads . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform shirt barely contained the roll of fat that rode on his gunbelt , let out an audible sigh and spun 180 degrees on the soles of his big black leather cop shoes . The prosecutors and defense lawyers regarded Kovitsky as a holy terror . But the court officers were basic working-class line troops from the civil service , and they regarded Kovitsky , like practically every other judge , as outrageously and cravenly soft on criminals . . . letting this maniac sit there and read from the Koran while his children ran around the courtroom yelling , " Yo , Herbert ! " Kovitsky 's reasoning seemed to be that since Herbert 92X was a hothead , and since reading from the Koran cooled him off , he was saving time in the long run . . . turn away evil with that which is better , and behold , the man between whom and thyself there was enmity shall become , as it were , thy warmest friend , but none shall attain to . . . " In Herbert 's doleful orotund reading , the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kramer 's mind wandered . . . The girl with brown lipstick . . . Soon she would be coming out . . . The very thought made him straighten himself up in his chair . . . He wished he had taken a look at himself before he came into the courtroom . . . at his hair , his tie . . . He tensed his neck and threw his head back . . . He was convinced that women were impressed by men with huge sternocleidomastoid muscles . . . He closed his eyes . . . Herbert was still reading away , when Kovitsky broke in : " Thank you , Mr. 92X , that concludes the reading from the Koran . " " Say what ? I 'm not finished ! " " I said that concludes the reading from the Koran , Mr. 92X . DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR ? " Kovitsky 's voice was suddenly so loud , people in the spectators ' section gasped . Herbert jumped to his feet . " You 're violating my rights ! " His chin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked like a rocket about to take off . " Sid-down ! " " You 're violating my freedom of religion ! " " SID-DOWN , MR. 92x ! " " Mistrial ! " shouted Herbert . " Mistrial ! " Then he turned his fury on  | Teskowitz , who was still seated beside him . " Get up on your feet , man ! This is a mistrial ! " Startled and a bit frightened , Teskowitz got up . " Your Honor , my client ? " " I SAID SIDDOWNt . BOTH A YOUt . Both sat down . " Now , Mr. 92X , this court has been very indulgent with you . Nobody is violating your freedom of religion . The hour grows late , and we 've got a jury out there in a jury room that has n't been painted in twenty-five years , and the time has come to conclude the reading of the Koran . " " Say , conclude ? You mean forbid ! You 're violating my religious rights ! " " The defendant will SHUDDUP ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Talmud or the Bible or the words of the Angel Moroni , who wrote the Book of Mormon , or any other spiritual tome , no matter how divine  --  you do n't have the right to read it in this courtroom . Let me remind you , sir , that this is not the Nation of Islam . We happen to live in a republic , and in this republic there is a separation of church and state . Do you understand ? And this court is governed by the laws of that republic , which are embodied in the Constitution of the United States . " " That 's not true ! " " What 's not true , Mr. 92X ? " " The separation of church and state . And I can prove it . " " Whaddaya talking about , Mr. 92X ? " 11 " Turn around ! Look up on the wall ! " Herbert was on his feet again , pointing at the wall up above Kovitsky 's head . Kovitsky swiveled about in his chair and looked up . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN GOD WE TRUST . " Church and state ! " Herbert cried triumphantly . " You got it carved in the wall over your head ! " Heh heh heggggh ! A woman in the spectators ' section started laughing . One of the court officers guffawed but turned his head before Kovitsky could spot him . The clerk , Bruzzielli , could n't keep the grin off his face . Patti Stullieri had her hand over her mouth . Kramer looked at Mike Kovitsky , waiting for the explosion . Instead , Kovitsky put a broad smile on his face . But his head was lowered , and his irises were once again floating , bobbing on a turbulent white sea . " I can see you 're very observant , Mr. 92X , and I commend you for that . And since you are so observant , you will also observe that I do not  | have eyes in the back of my head . But I do have eyes in the front of my head , and what they are looking at is a defendant who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prison term of twelve and a half to twenty-five years , should he be found guilty by a jury of his peers , and I want that jury to have the time to tend the scales of justice . . . with CARE and FAIRNESS ! . . . in determining the guilt or innocence of that defendant . It 's a free country , Mr. 92X , and nobody can stop you from believing in any deity you want . But as long as you 're in this courtroom , you better believe in THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MIKE ! " Kovitsky said it with such ferocity that Herbert sat back down in his chair . He did n't say a word . Instead , he looked at Teskowitz . Teskowitz merely shrugged and shook his head , as if to say , " That 's about the size of it , Herbert . " " Bring in the jury , " said Kovitsky . A court officer opened the door that led to the jury room . Kramer sat up straight in his chair at the prosecution table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful neck . The jurors began filing in . . . three blacks , six Puerto Ricans . . . Where was she ? . . . There she was , just coming through the door ! . . . Kramer did n't even try to be subtle about it . He stared right at her . That long lustrous dark brown hair , thick enough to bury your head in , parted in the middle and pulled back to reveal that perfect pure white forehead , those big eyes and luxurious lashes , and those perfectly curved lips . . . with brown lipstick ! Yes ! She had it on again ! The brown lipstick , the color of caramel , hellish , rebellious , perfectly elegant Kramer quickly surveyed the competition . The big clerk , Bruzzielli , had his eyes pinned on her . The three court officers were staring at her so hard Herbert could have taken a walk and they would have never noticed . But Herbert himself was checking her out . Teskowitz was looking at her . Sullivan , the court stenographer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Kovitsky ! Him , too ! Kramer had heard stories about Kovitsky . He did n't seem to be the type  --  but you never knew . To get to the jury box she had to file right past the prosecution table . She had on a peach-colored sweater , fluffy , angora or mohair , open up the front , and a ribbon-silk blouse with pink-and-yellow stripes , beneath which Kramer could detect , or thought he could detect , the voluptuous swell of her breasts . She wore a cream-colored gabardine skirt , tight enough to bring out the curve of her thighs . The hell of it was , practically every man on this side of the Bar of Justice had a fighting chance . Well , not Herbert , but his wispy little  | lawyer , Teskowitz , did . Even that fat court officer over there , that tub Kaminsky . The number of court officers , defense lawyers , court clerks , assistant district attorneys ( oh yes ! ) and even judges ( do n't rule them out ! ) who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurors in criminal cases  --  God ! if the press ever got hold of that story  --  but the press never showed up in the courthouse in the Bronx . First-time jurors in the criminal courts had a way of becoming intoxicated by the romance , the raw voltage , of the evil world they were now getting a box-seat look at , and the young women became the tipsiest of all . To them the defendants were not chow ; anything but . They were desperadoes . And these cases were not pieces a shit . They were stark dramas of the billion-footed city . And those with the courage to deal with the desperadoes , wrestle with them , bridle them , were . . . real men . . . even a court officer with a four-inch tube of fat riding up over his gunbelt . But who was more manly than a young prosecutor , he who stood not ten feet from the accused , with nothing between the two of them but thin air , and hurled the charges of the People in his teeth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back at him . Her expression said nothing , but the look was so frank and forthright ! And she wore brown lipstick ! And then she was past him and going through the little gate into the jury box . He could n't very well turn around and stare at her , but he was tempted . How many of them had gone to the clerk , Bruzzielli , and looked up her address and telephone numbers , at home and at work  --  as he had ? The clerk kept the slips with this information , the so-called ballots , in a box on his desk in the courtroom , so that the court could get hold of jurors quickly to inform them of changes in schedule or whatever . As the prosecutor in the case , he , Kramer , could approach Bruzzielli and ask to see the ballot for the girl with brown lipstick or any other juror with a straight face . So could the defense attorney , Teskowitz . Kovitsky could do it with a reasonably straight face , and of course Bruzzielli himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for a court officer like Kaminsky , for him to ask to take a look fell under the category of . . . a wink and a favor . But had n't Kramer already seen Kaminsky huddled with Bruzzielli over by Bruzzielli 's desk , deep in conversation over . . something ? The thought that even such creatures as the fat Kaminsky were after this . . . this flower . . . made Kramer more determined than ever . ( He would save her from the others . ) Miss Shelly Thomas of Riverdale . She was from the very best part of Riverdale , a leafy suburb that was  | ) graphically part of Westchester County but politically part of the Bronx . There were still plenty of nice places to live in the North Bronx . People in Riverdale generally had money , and they also had their ways of Felting off jury duty . They would pull every string that existed before ? uhmitting to the prospect of coming down to the South Bronx , to the 44th Precinct , to the island fortress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , with a sprinkling of Jews and Italians . But every now and then a rare flower like Miss Shelly Thomas of Riverdale landed in a jury box . What kind of name was that ? Thomas was a Waspy name . But there was Danny Thomas , and he was an Arab , a $ , ebanese or something . Wasps were rare in the Bronx , except for those #ociety types who came up from Manhattan from time to time , in cars ' with drivers , to do good deeds for the Ghetto Youth . The Big Brother ganization , the Episcopal Youth Service , the Daedalus Foundationese people showed up in Family Court , which was the court for crimiIs under the age of seventeen . They had these names . . . Farnsworth , cke , Phipps , Simpson , Thornton , Frost . . . and spotless intentions . No , the chances that Miss Shelly Thomas might be a Wasp were rete . But what was she ? During jury selection he had elicited from her information that she was an art director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prischker &; Bolka advertising agency in nhattan . To Kramer that suggested an inexpressibly glamorous life . utiful creatures scampering back and forth to taped New Wave music an office with smooth white walls and glass brick . . . a sort of MTV ce . . . terrific lunches and dinners in restaurants with blond wood , ss , indirect lighting , and frosted glass with chevron patterns on it . . . ed quail with chanterelles on a bed of sweet potato and a ruff of ised dandelion leaves . . . He could see it all . She was part of that those places where the girls with brown lipstick go ! . . . He had h of her telephone numbers , at Prischker &; Bolka and at home . Natuly he could n't do a thing while the trial was in progress . But afterward . Miss Thomas ? This is Lawrence Kramer . I 'm  --  oh ! you remember ! is terrific ! Miss Thomas , I 'm calling because every so often , after one these major cases is completed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury  --  a sudden stab of doubt . . . Suppose all that pened was that she lost the case for him ? Bronx juries were difficult ugh for a prosecutor as it was . They were drawn from the ranks of e who know that in fact the police are capable of lying . Bronx juries rtained a lot of doubts , both reasonable and unreasonable , and black Puerto Rican defendants who were stone guilty , guilty as sin , did  | walk out of the fortress free as birds . Fortunately , Herbert 92X had shot a good man , a poor man , a family man from the ghetto . Thank God for that ! No juror who lived in the South Bronx was likely to have sympathy for a foul-tempered nut case like Herbert . Only a wild card like Miss Shelly Thomas of Riverdale was likely to have sympathy ! A well-educated young white woman , well-to-do , the artistic type , possibly Jewish . . . She was just the type to turn idealistic on him and refuse to convict Herbert on the grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon by Fate . But he had to take that chance . He did n't intend to let her slip by . He needed her . He needed this particular triumph . In this courtroom he was in the center of the arena . Her eyes had never left him . He knew that . He could feel it . There was already something between them . . . Larry Kramer and the girl with brown lipstick . The regulars were amazed that day by the zeal and aggressiveness of Assistant District Attorney Kramer in this nickel-and-dime Bronx manslaughter case . He started tearing into Herbert 's alibi witnesses . " Is n't it true , Mr. Williams , that this testimony ' of yours is part of a cash transaction between you and the defendant ? " What the hell had gotten into Kramer ? Teskowitz was beginning to get furious . This sonofabitch Kramer was making him look bad ! He was tearing up the courtroom as if this piece a shit were the trial of the century . Kramer was oblivious of the wounded feelings of Teskowitz or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were only two people in that cavernous mahogany hall , and they were Larry Kramer and the girl with brown lipstick . During the lunch recess Kramer went back to the office , as did Ray Andriutti and Jimmy Caughey . An assistant district attorney who had a trial going was entitled to lunch for himself and his witnesses courtesy of the State of New York . In practice what this meant was that everybody in the office stood to get a free lunch , and Andriutti and Caughey were first in line . This pathetic little perk of the office was taken very seriously . Bernie Fitzgibbon 's secretary , Gloria Dawson , ordered sandwiches in from the deli . She got one , too . Kramer had a roast-beef sandwich on an onion roll with mustard . The mustard came in a gelatinous sealed plastic envelope that he had to open with his teeth . Ray Andriutti was having a pepperoni hero with everything you could throw into it thrown in , except for two enormous slices of dill pickle that were lying on a piece of waxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brine filled the room . Kramer arched with disgusted fascination as Andriutti lunged forward , over his desk , so that the pieces and the juices that squirted overboard from the ro would fall on the desk instead of his necktie . He did that with every te ; he lunged over the desk , and bits of food and juice spilled from his w , as if he were a whale or a tuna . With each lunge his jaw shot past a stic cup of coffee which was on the desk . The coffee came from the r . Coffee . The cup was so full , the coffee bulged with surface tension . All at once , it began to overflow . A viscous yellow creek , no wider than a wing , began running down the side of the cup . Andriutti did n't even ? tice . When the filthy yellow flow reached the desktop , it created a pool o ut the size of a Kennedy half-dollar . In no time , it was the size and or of a dollar pancake . Soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muck . Andriutti always loaded his coffee with mora powder and sugar until it turned into a heavy sweet sick highlow bile . His gaping jaws , with the pepperoni hero stuffed in , kept ging in front of the cup . The high point of the day ! A free lunch ! And it does n't get any better , thought Kramer . It was not just young ' stant D.A . ' s like him and Andriutti and Jimmy Caughey . All over raltar , at this moment , from the lowest to the highest , the representa-of the Power in the Bronx were holed up in their offices , shellked , hunched over deli sandwiches , ordered in . Around the big conce table in Abe Weiss 's office they were hunched over their deli dwiches , they being whomever Weiss thought he needed and could get of that day in his crusade for publicity . Around the big conference e in the office of the chief administrative judge for the Criminal Divi , Louis Mastroiani , they were hunched over their deli sandwiches . when this worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when a United States senator came by , they sat there hunched their deli sandwiches , the luminary , too . You could ascend to the top of the criminal justice system in the Bronx and eat deli sandes for lunch until the day you retired or died . d why ? Because they , the Power , the Power that ran the Bronx , terrified ! They were terrified to go out into the heart of the Bronx at noon and have lunch in a restaurant ! Terrified ! And they ran the the Bronx , a borough of 1.1 million souls ! The heart of the Bronx now such a slum there was no longer anything even resembling a nessman 's sit-down restaurant . But even if there were , what judge or . or assistant D.A. , what court officer , even packing a .38 , would Gibraltar at lunchtime to get to it ? First there was plain fear . You  | walked from the Bronx County Building across the Grand Concourse and down the slope of 161st Street to the Criminal Courts Building , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to , but the prudent bearer of the Power kept his wits about him . There were holdups on the crest of the Grand Concourse , this great ornament of the Bronx , at 11:00 a.m. on nice sunny days . And why not ? More wallets and handbags were out on foot in the middle of nice sunny days . You did n't go beyond the Criminal Courts Building at all . There were assistant D.A . ' s who had worked in Gibraltar for ten years who could n't tell you , on a bet , what was on 162nd Street or 163rd Street , a block off the Grand Concourse . They had never even been to the Bronx Museum of Art on 164th . But suppose you were fearless in that sense . There remained another , subtler fear . You were an alien on the streets of the 44th Precinct , and you knew that at once , every time Fate led you into their territory . The looks ! The looks ! The deadly mistrust ! You were not wanted . You were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Party , to the Jews and Italians , specifically , but the streets belonged to the Lockwoods and the Arthur Riveras and the Jimmy Dollards and Otis Blakemores and the Herbert 92X 's . The thought depressed Kramer . Here they were , himself and Andriutti , the Jew and the Italian , wolfing down their sandwiches , ordered in , inside the fortress , inside the limestone rock . And for what ? What did they have to look forward to ? How could this setup survive long enough for them to reach the top of the pyramid , even assuming it was worth reaching ? Sooner or later the Puerto Ricans and the blacks would pull themselves together politically , and they would seize even Gibraltar and everything in it . And meantime , what would he be doing ? He 'd be stirring the muck . . . stirring the muck . . . until they took the stick away from him . Just then the telephone rang . " Hello ? " " Bernie ? " " but " You got the wrong extension , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " " Who is this ? " " Kramer . " " Oh yeah , I remember you . This is Detective Martin . " Kramer did n't really remember Martin , but the name and the voice FI triggered a vaguely unpleasant recollection . " What can I do for you ? "  | " Well , I 'm over here at Lincoln Hospital with my partner , Goldberg , and we got this half-a-homicide case , and I thought we ought to tell Bernie about it . " " Did you talk to somebody here a couple hours ago ? Ray Andriutti ? " " Yeah . " Kramer sighed . " Well , Bernie 's still not back . I do n't know where he is . A pause . " Shit . Maybe you can pass this along to him . " Another sigh . " Okay . " " There 's this kid , Henry Lamb , L-A-M-B , eighteen years old , and he 's in the intensive-care unit . He came in here last night with a broken wrist . Okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on this sheet of paper , he did n't say nothing about getting hit by a car . It just says he fell . Okay ? So they fixed up the broken wrist in the emergency room , and they sent him home . This morning the kid 's mother , she brings him back in here , and he 's got a concussion , and he goes into a coma , and now they classify him as a likely-to-die . Okay ? " " Yeah . " " The kid was in the coma by the time they called us , but there 's this nurse here that says he told his mother he was hit by a car , a Mercedes , and the car left the scene , and he got a partial license number . " " Any witnesses ? " " No . This is all from the nurse . We ca n't even find the mother . " " Is this supposed to be two accidents or one accident ? You said a broken wrist and a concussion ? " " One , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my balls about a hit-and-run . It 's all fucked-up , but I just thought I 'd tell Bernie , in case he wants to do anything about it . " " Well , I 'll tell him , but I do n't see what it 's got to do with us . There 's no witness , no driver  --  the guy is in a coma  --  but I 'll tell him . " " Yeah , I know . If we find the mother and get anything , tell Bernie I 'll call him . " " Okay . " After he hung up , Kramer scribbled a note to Bernie Fitzgibbon . The victim neglected to mention he was hit by a car . A typical Bronx case . Another piece a shit .  | / The next morning Sherman McCoy experienced something that was new to him in the eight years he had been at Pierce &; Pierce . He was unable to concentrate . Ordinarily , as soon as he entered the bond trading room and the glare from the plate glass hit him and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ambition engulfed him , everything else in his life fell away and the world became the little green symbols that slid across the black screens of the computer terminals . Even on the morning after the most stupid telephone call he had ever made , the morning he woke up wondering if his wife was going to leave him and take the most precious thing in his life with her , namely , Campbell  --  even on that morning he had walked into the bond trading room and , just like that , human existence had narrowed down to French goldbacked bonds and U.S. government twenty-years . But now it was as if he had a two-track tape in his skull and the mechanism kept jumping from one track to the other without his having any control over it . On the screen : " U Frag 10.1 ' 96 102 . " Down a whole point ! The United Fragrance thirteen-year bonds , maturing in 1996 , had slipped from 103 to 102.5 yesterday . Now , at 102 , the yield would be 9.75 percent  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a person that the car hit when she backed up ? Why could n't it have been the tire or a trash can or something else entirely ' ' He tried to feel the jolt again in his central nervous system . It was a . .  | thok . . . a little tap . It really had n't been much . It could have been almost anything . But then he lost heart . What else could it have been but that tall skinny boy ? ? and then he could see that dark delicate face , the mouth hanging open with fear . . . It was n't too late to go to the police ! Thirty-six hours  --  forty by now  --  how would he put it ? I think that we ? that is , my friend Mrs. Ruskin and I  --  may have  --  for God 's sake , man , get hold of yourself ! After forty hours it would n't be reporting an accident , it would be a confession ! You 're a Master of the Universe . You are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave in under pressure . This happy thought steeled him for the task at hand , and he focused again on the screen . The numbers were sliding across in lines , as if a radium-green brush were painting them , and they had been sliding across and changing right before his eyes but without registering in his mind . That startled him . United Fragrance was down to 1017/8 , meaning the yield was up to almost 10 percent . Was something wrong ? But just yesterday he had run it by Research , and United Fragrance was in good shape , a solid AA . Right now all he needed to know was : Was there anything in The City Light ? It sizzled on the floor at his feet . There had been nothing in the Times , the Post , and the Daily News , which he had gone through in the taxi on the way down . The first edition of The City Light , an afternoon newspaper , did n't come out until after 10 a.m . So twenty minutes ago he had given Felix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring The City Light to him . But how could he possibly read it ? He could n't even let himself be seen with it on top of his desk . Not him ; not after the tongue-lashing he had given young Senor Arguello . So it was under the desk , on the floor , sizzling at his feet . It I sizzled , and he was on fire . He burned with a desire to pick it up and go through it . . . right now . . . and the hell with what it looked like But of course that was irrational . Besides , what difference would it make whether he read it now or six hours from now ? What could it possibly change ? Not very much , not very much . And then he burned some more , until he thought he could n't stand it . Shit ! Something was happening with the United Fragrance thirteen years ! They were back up to 102 ! Other buyers were spotting the bargain ! Act fast ! He dialed Oscar Suder 's number in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank . . . What was his last name ? . . . Frank . Frank the doughnut . . . " Frank ?

" In no time the doughnut was back . " Oscar 'll take three . " " Okay . Fine . Three million United Fragrance ten-point-tens of ' 96 . " " Right . " " Thanks , Frank , and best to Oscar . Oh , and tell him I 'll be back to him before long about the Giscard . The franc is down a bit , but that 's easy to hedge . Anyway , I 'll talk to him .

He would n't  --  or would he ? Freddy regarded himself as a family friend . He knew Judy , and he asked about Campbell whenever they chatted , even though Freddy was probably homosexual . Well , homosexuals could care about children , could n't they ? Freddy had children of his own . That did n't mean he was n't a homosexual , however ? Christ ! . what the hell did wander it matter , Freddy Button 's sex life ? It was crazy to let his mind like this . Freddy Button . He would feel like a fool if he told this whole story to Freddy Button and it turned out to be a false alarm . . . which it probably was .

For a moment he felt good about himself all over again . The law of the jungle ! The Master of the Universe ! 1Then the bottom dropped out . They had never overtly threatened him . Yo ! Need some help ? And Maria had probably hit him with the car . Yes , it was Maria . I was n't driving . She was driving . But did that absolve him of responsibility in the eyes of the law ? And did What was that ? On the screen , United Fragrance ten-point-tens of ' 96 blipped up to 1021/8 . Ah ! That meant he 'd just gained a quarter of a percentage point on three million bonds for Oscar Suder by acting fast . He 'd let him know that tomorrow . Would help ice the Giscard  --  but if anything happens with the . . . thok . . . the tall delicate boy . . . The little green symbols glowed radioactively on the screen . They had n't III budged for at least a minute . He could n't stand it any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no law against that . He took a big manila envelope off his desk . The flap had a string that you wrapped around a paper disk in order to close the envelope . It was the sort of envelope that was used to relay documents from one office to another . He panned  | across the bond trading room to see if the coast was clear , then put his head under the desk and stuffed The City Light into the envelope and headed for the bathroom . There were four cubicles , two urinals , and a large sink . In the cubicle he was dreadfully aware of the rustle of the newspaper as he took it out of the envelope . How could he possibly turn the pages ? Every rustling crinkling crackling turn of the page would be a thunderous announcement that some slacker was in here goofing on a newspaper . He pulled his feet to toward the china base of the toilet bowl . That way no one could get a glimpse under the cubicle door of his half-brogued New &; Lingwood shoes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aha ! McCoy . " Hidden behind the toilet door , the Master of the Universe began ransacking the newspaper at a furious clip , page by filthy page . There was nothing , no mention of a boy struck down on a highway ramp in the Bronx . He felt vastly relieved . Almost two full days had now passed  --  and nothing . Christ , it was hot in here . He was perspiring terribly . How could he let himself get carried away like this ? Maria was right . the brutes had attacked , and he had beaten the brutes , and they had escaped , and that was that . With his bare hands he had triumphed ! Or was it that the boy had been hit and the police were looking for the r , but the newspapers did n't regard it as important enough to rate a story ? The fever began to rise again . Suppose something did get in the papers . . even a hint . . . How could he ever put the Giscard deal together der a cloud like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . finished ! . . . And en as he quaked with fear of such a catastrophe , he knew he was letting self wallow in it for a superstitious reason . If you consciously envined something that dreadful , then it could n't possibly take place , uld it . . . God or Fate would refuse to be anticipated by a mere rtal , would n't He . . . He always insisted on giving His disasters the rity of surprise , did n't He . . . And yet  --  and yet  --  some forms of ) m are so obvious you ca n't avoid them that way , can you ! One breath scandal-his spirits plunged even lower . One breath of scandal , and not only ould the Giscard scheme collapse but his very career would be finished ! And what would he do then ? I 'm already going broke on a million dollars year ! The appalling figures came popping up into his brain . Last year income had been $980,000 . But he had to pay out $21,000 a month the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . What  | was $21,000 a month to someone making a million a year ? That was the way he had thought of it at the time  --  and in fact , it was merely a crushing , grinding burden  --  that was all ! It came to $252,000 a year , none of it deductible , because it was a personal loan , not a mortgage . ( The cooperative boards in Good Park Avenue Buildings like his did n't allow you to take out a mortgage on your apartment . ) So , considering the taxes , it required $420,000 in income to pay the $252,000 . Of the $560,000 remaining of his income last year , $44,400 was required for the apartment 's monthly maintenance fees ; $116,000 for the house on Old Drover 's Mooring Lane in Southampton ( $84,000 for mortgage payment and interest , $18,000 for heat , utilities , insurance , and repairs , $6,000 for lawn and hedge cutting , $8,000 for taxes ) . Entertaining at home and in restaurants had come to $37,000 . This was a modest sum compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's birthday party in Southampton had had only one carnival ride ( plus , of course , the obligatory ponies and the magician ) and had cost less than $4,000 . The Taliaferro School . ' including the bus service , cost $9,400 for the year . The tab for furniture I ! I ' and clothes had come to about $65,000 ; and there was little hope of reducing that , since Judy was , after all , a decorator and had to keep things up to par . The servants ( Bonita , Miss Lyons , Lucille the cleaning woman , and Hobie the handyman in Southampton ) came to $62,000 a year . That left only $226,200 , or $18,850 a month , for additional taxes and this and that , including insurance payments ( nearly a thousand a month , if averaged out ) , garage rent for two cars ( $840 a month ) , household food ( $1,500 a month ) , club dues ( about $250 a month ) ? the abysmal truth was that he had spent more than $980,000 last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but not nearly enough ? 0 the worst happened ! There was no getting out from under the $1.8 million loan , the crushing $21,000-a-month nut , without paying it off or selling l ! Ij the apartment and moving into one far smaller and more modest  --  an impossibility ! There was no turning back ! Once you had lived in a $2M million apartment on Park Avenue  --  it was impossible to live in a $1 million apartment ! Naturally , there was no way to explain this to a living soul . Unless you were a complete fool , you could n't even make the words 1 come out of your mouth . Nevertheless  --  it was so ! It was . . . an impos sibility ! Why , his building was one of the great ones built just before the ! I First World War ! Back then it was still not entirely proper for a good family to live in an apartment ( instead of a house ) . So the apartments were built like mansions , with eleven- , twelve- , thirteen-foot ceilings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , herringbone-parquet floors , in-  | tenor walls a foot thick , exterior walls as thick as a fort 's , and fireplaces , fireplaces , fireplaces , even though the buildings were all built with central beating . A mansion ! ? except that you arrived at the front door via an elevator ( opening upon your own private vestibule ) instead of the street . That was what you got for $2.6 million , and anyone who put one foot in the entry gallery of the McCoy duplex on the tenth floor knew he was in .. . one of those fabled apartments that the world , le monde , died for ! - And what did a million get you today ? At most , at most , at most : a threebedroom apartment  --  no servants ' rooms , no guest rooms , let alone ressing rooms and a sunroom  --  in a white-brick high-rise built east of + ' ark Avenue in the 1960s with 81/2-foot ceilings , a dining room but no brary , an entry gallery the size of a closet , no fireplace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmit whispers , and no rivate elevator stop . Oh no ; instead , a mean windowless elevator hall ith at least five pathetically plain bile-beige metal-sheathed doors , each ? rotected by two or more ugly drop locks , opening upon it , one of these orbid portals being yours . Patently . . . an impossibility ! He sat with his $650 New &; Lingwood shoes pulled up against the Id white bowl of the toilet and the newspaper rustling in his trembling nds , envisioning Campbell , her eyes brimming with tears , leaving the arbled entry hall on the tenth floor for the last time , commencing her : cent into the lower depths . Since I 've foreseen it , God , you ca n't let it happen , can you ? The Giscard ! . . . Had to move fast ! Had to have a print ! . . . This rase suddenly possessed his mind , have a print . When a big deal such the Giscard was completed , closed , once and for all , it was set down in e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing company , a press . Have a print ! Have a print ! He sat there , riding a white china toilet bowl , beseeching the Almighty a print . Two young white men sat in a mansion in Harlem staring at a middleed black man . The younger one , the one doing the talking , was rattled what he saw . He felt as if he had been removed from his own body by tral projection and was listening like a spectator to his own words as y came out of his mouth . " So I do n't know exactly how to put it , Reverend Bacon , but the thing we  --  I mean the diocese  --  the Episcopal Church  --  we 've given you 50.000 as seed money for the Little Shepherd Day Care Center , and we  | received a telephone call yesterday from a newspaper reporter , and he said the Human Resources Administration turned down your license application nine weeks ago , and I mean , well , we just could n't believe it . It was the first thing we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The words continued to come out of his mouth , but the young man . whose name was Edward Fiske III , was no longer thinking about them . His voice was on automatic , while his mind tried to make sense out of the situation he was in . The room was a vast Beaux Arts salon full of highgrained oak architraves and cornices and plaster rosettes and swags with gilt highlights and fluted corner beads and ogeed baseboards , all of it carefully restored to the original turn-of-the-century style . It was the sort of mansion the dry-goods barons used to erect in New York before the First World War . But now the baron of these premises , seated behind a huge mahogany desk , was a black man . His high-backed swivel chair was upholstered in a rich oxbloodcolored leather . There was n't a trace of emotion on his face . He was one of those thin , rawboned men who look powerful without being muscular . His receding black hair was combed straight back for about two inches before it broke into ruffles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with peaked lapels , a white shirt with a high starched spread collar , and a black necktie with broad white diagonal stripes . On his left wrist was a watch with enough gold to read a meter by . Fiske became unnaturally aware of the sound of his own voice : " . . . and then we made  --  actually , I made  --  a telephone call to the HRA , and I spoke to a Mr. Lubidoff , and he told me  --  and I 'm only repeating to you what he said  --  he said that several  --  actually , he said seven  --  he said seven of the nine directors of the Little Shepherd Day Care Center have prison records , and three are on parole , which means that technically , legally " ? he glanced at his young colleague , Moody . who was a lawyer ? " they are considered or accorded or , I should say . burdened with the status of an inmate . " Fiske stared at Reverend Bacon and opened his eyes wide and arched his eyebrows . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversational vacuum . He did n't dare try to question him , interrogate him . The best he could hope for was to lay down certain facts that would compel him , through the logic of the situation , to respond . But Reverend Bacon did n't even change his expression . He just stared at the young man as if he were looking at a gerbil on a treadmill in a cage . The narrow mustache that outlined his upper lip did n't budge  | Then he began drumming the first two fingers of his left hand on his desk , as if to say , " And therefore ? " It was n't Reverend Bacon but Fiske himself who could n't bear the vacuum and plunged in . " And therefore  --  well , I mean , in the eyes of the HRA  --  the way they look at it  --  and they 're the licensing authority for day-care centers  --  and you 're aware of all the furor  --  how sensitive they are about day-care centers  --  it 's a big political issue  --  that three directors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on parole , they are still in prison , because people on parole are still serving a prison sentence and are still subject to all the . . . all the . . . well , whatever . .. and the other four also have records , which by itself is enough to . . . to . . . Well , the regulations do n't allow it ? " The words were gushing out in awkward spurts , while his mind rushed all over the room , trying to find an exit . Fiske was one of those superbly healthy white people who retain the peachy complexion of a thirteenyear-old until well into their late twenties . Just now his fine fair face was beginning to redden . He was embarrassed . No , he was scared . In a few moments he was going to have to get to the part about the $350,000 , unless his sidekick over here , Moody , the lawyer , did it for him . God almighty , how had it come to this ? After leaving Yale , Fiske had gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master 's thesis entitled " Quantitative Aspects of Ethical Behavior in a Capital-Intensive Corporation . " For the past three years he had been Community Outreach Director of the Episcopal Diocese of New York , a position that involved him in the diocese 's heavy moral and financial support of Reverend Bacon and his works . But even in the auspicious heart-warming early days , two years ago , he had been uneasy about these trips to this big old town house in Harlem . From the beginning , a thousand little things had snapped away at the ankles of his profound intellectual liberalism , starting with this business of " Reverend Bacon . " Every Yale man , or certainly every Episcopalian among them , knew that Reverend was an adjective , not a noun . It was like Honorable before the name of a legislator or a judge . You might refer to " the Honorable William Rehnquist , " but you would n't call him " Honorable Rehnquist . " In the same way , you could refer to " the Reverend Reginald Bacon " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " Reverend Bacon " ? except in this house and in this part of New York , where you called him whatever he wanted to be called , and you forgot about Yale . The truth was , Fiske had found Reverend Bacon forbidding even in those early days when he had been all  | smiles . They agreed on practically all philosophical and political issues . Yet they were in no way similar people . And these were not the early days . These were what you might call the last days . . . And so , obviously we have a problem , Reverend Bacon . Until we can get this straightened out about the license  --  and I wish we had known about it nine weeks ago , when it happened  --  well , I do n't see that there 's any way the project can go forward until we resolve it . Not that it ca n't be resolved , of course  --  but you 've got to  --  well , the first thing we 've got to do , it seems to me , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally , this board  --  I mean , your present board  --  this board ca n't spend any of those moneys on the day-care center , because the board will have to be reorganized , it seems to me , which , when you get right down to it , means a reorganization of the corporation , and that will take some time . Not a lot of time , perhaps , but it will take some time , and .. As his voice struggled on , Fiske cut his eyes toward his colleague . This fellow Moody did n't seemed fazed at all . He sat there in an armchair , with his head cocked to one side , very coolly , as if he had Reverend Bacon 's number . This was his first trip up to the House of Bacon , and he seemed to regard it as a bit of a lark . He was the latest junior member whom the firm of Dunning Sponget &; Leach had fobbed off on the diocese , an account they regarded as prestigious but " soft . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Fiske that he , too , had gone to Yale . He had been a line-backer on the football team . He managed to mention that about five different times . He had come walking into Reverend Bacon 's headquarters as if he had a keg of Dortmunder Light between his legs . He had sat down in the chair and leaned back , gloriously relaxed . But he said nothing . . . " So in the meantime , Reverend Bacon , " said Ed Fiske , " we thought the prudent thing would be  --  we talked this over at the diocese  --  this was everybody 's thought on the thing , not just mine  --  we thought the wise thing  --  I mean , all we 're concerned about here is the future of the project , of the Little Shepherd Day Care Center  --  because we 're still a hundred percent behind the project  --  that has n't changed a bit  --  we thought the prudent thing would be to place the $350,000 ? not counting the money that 's already gone toward leasing the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the other  --  what ? ? $340,000 , or whatever it is , into an escrow account , and then when you 've gotten the business of the board of directors straightened out , and you 've gotten the licensing from the HRA , and there 's no  |  --  - ore red tape to worry about , those moneys will be turned over to you and your new board , and , well , that 's . . . sort of it ! " Fiske opened his eyes wide again and arched his eyebrows and even attempted a little friendly smile , as if to say , " Hey ! We 're all in the same boat here , are n't we ! " He looked at Moody , who continued to stare at Reverend Bacon in his cool fashion . Reverend Bacon did n't even so much as blink , and something about that implacable gaze made Fiske decide that it was unwise to continue looking into his eyes . He looked at Reverend Bacon 's fingers as they did their paradiddle on the desk . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a large handsome leather-bound desk blotter , a gold Dunhill pen-and-pencil set mounted  --  an onyx pedestal , a collection of paperweights and medals imbedded in Lucite , several of which had been inscribed to Reverend Reginald Bacon by civic organizations , a stack of papers held down by a paperweight consisting mainly of the letters WNBC-TV in thick brass , an intercom with a row of buttons , and a large box-shaped ashtray with leather sides framed in brass and a brass grillwork over the top . . . Fiske kept his eyes lowered . Into the vacuum came the sounds of the building . On the floor above , heavily muffled by the building 's thick floors and walls , the faint sound of a piano . . . Moody , sitting right next to him , probably did n't even notice . But Fiske , in his mind , could sing right along with those rich crashing chords . " The mil-len-ni-al rei-eign . . . " Is going . . . to be . . . " Huge chords . " One thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lo-ords . . . " Ho-ost of hosts . . . " More chords . A whole ocean of chords . She was up there right now . When this thing first started , this business of the diocese and Reverend Bacon , Fiske used to play Reverend Bacon 's mother 's records in his apartment at night and sing along , at the top of his lungs , with ecstatic abandon ? " The mil-len-ni-al rei-eiggn ! " ? a song made famous by Shirley Caeser . . . oh , he knew his gospel singers  --  him ! ? Edward Fiske 11I , Yale ' 80 ! ? who now had legitimate entry into that rich black world . . The name Adela Bacon still appeared on the gospel music charts from time to time . Of all the organizations listed in the mansion 's entry hall down below , ALL PEOPLE 'S SOLIDARITY , THE GATES OF THE KINGDOM CHURCH , THE OPEN GATES EMPLOYMENT COALITION , MOTHERHOOD ALERT , THE LITTLE CHILDREN 'S ANTI-DRUG CRUSADE , THE  | THIRD WORLD ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE , THE LITTLE SHEPHERD DAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adela Bacon 's MILLENNIAL REIGN MUSIC CORPORATION was a conventional business organization . He regretted that he had never really come to know her . She had founded the Gates of the Kingdom Church , which was supposedly Reverend Bacon 's church but which in reality scarcely existed any longer . She had run it ; she had conducted the services ; she had uplifted the church 's Pentecostal flock with her amazing contralto voice and the cresting waves of her oceans of chords  --  and she and she alone had been the church body that had ordained her son Reggie as the Reverend Regi , nald Bacon . At first Fiske had been shocked to learn this . Then a great sociological truth dawned upon him . All religious credentials are arbitrary , self-proclaimed . Who originated the articles of faith under which his own boss , the Episcopal Bishop of New York , had been ordained ? Did Moses bring them down in stone from the mountaintop ? No , some Englishman dreamed them up a few centuries ago , and a lot of people with long white faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith was merely older , more ossified , and more respectable than the Baconian in white society . But it was long past time to worry about theology and church history . It was time to retrieve $350,000 . Now he could hear water running and a refrigerator door opening and one of those hair-trigger coffee machines coming to a boil . That meant the door to the little service kitchen was open . A tall black man was peering out . He wore a blue work shirt . He had a long powerful neck and wore a single large gold earring , like a storybook pirate . That was one of the things about this place . . . the way these . . . these . . . these . . . heavies were always around . They no longer seemed like romantic revolutionaries to Fiske . . . They seemed like . . . The thought of what they might be caused Fiske to avert his eyes . . . Now he looked past Bacon , out the bay window behind him . The window looked out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard received only a gloomy greenish light because of the buildings that had gone up on the streets behind it . Fiske could see the trunks of three huge old sycamores . That was all that remained of what must have been quite a little piece of scenery , by New York standards , in its day . The muffled chords . In his mind , Fiske could hear the beautiful voice of Adela Bacon : " Oh , what . .. shall I say , Lord ? " And it came . . . to pass . . . "  | Waves of muffled chords . " A voice . . . from on high said . . . " All flesh . . . is grass . . " A whole ocean of chords . Reverend Bacon stopped drumming his fingers . He placed the tips of the fingers of both hands on the edge of the desk . He lifted his chin slightly and he said : " This is Harlem . " He said it slowly and softly . He was as calm as Fiske was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise his voice . Reverend Bacon froze the look on his face and the position of his hands , in order to let his words sink in completely . " This , " he said once more , " is Harlem . . . see . .. " He paused . " You come up here now , after all this time , and you tell me there are people with prison records on the board of directors of the Little Shepherd Day Care Center . You inform me of that fact . " " I 'm not telling you , Reverend Bacon , " said Fiske . " That 's what the Human uman Resources Administration is telling us both . " It " I want to tell you something . I want to remind you of something you told me . Who do we want to run the Little Shepherd Day Care Center ? Do you remember ? Do we want your Wellesley girls and your Vassar girls coming up here to take care of the children of Harlem ? Do we want your social benefactors ? Do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall ? Is that what we want ? Is that what we want ? " Fiske felt compelled to answer . Obediently as a first-grader , he said , No . " " No , " said Reverend Bacon approvingly , " that is not what we want . What do we want ? We want the people of Harlem looking after the children of Harlem . We 're going to draw our strength . . . our strength .. from our people and our own streets . I told you that a long time o , in the earliest days . Do you remember ? Do you remember that ? " " Yes , " said Fiske , feeling more juvenile by the minute , and more helpless in the face of that steady gaze . " Yes . Our own streets . Now , a young man grows up on the streets of arlem , the chances are the police have a sheet on that young man . You derstand ? They have a sheet on that young man . I 'm talking about a ' lice record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in jail and erybody coming out of jail and everybody on parole , if you 're saying ,  | You ca n't participate in the rebirth of Harlem , because we gave up on you soon as you got a record ' . . . see . . . then you are not talking about the rebirth of Harlem . You 're talking about some make-believe place , some magic kingdom . You 're fooling yourself . You 're not looking for a radical solution . You 're wanting to play the same old game , you 're wanting to see the same old faces . You 're wanting to practice the same old colonialism . You understand ? You understand what I 'm saying ? " Fiske was about to nod yes , when all at once Moody spoke up : " Look , Reverend Bacon , we know all about that , but that 's not the problem . We 've got an immediate , specific , technical , legal problem . By law , the HRA is forbidden to issue a license under these circumstances , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's take care of that problem , and let 's see about the $350,000 , and then we 'll be in a position to solve the larger problems . " Fiske could n't believe what he was hearing . Involuntarily he slid down in his seat and took a wary glance at Reverend Bacon . Reverend Bacon stared at Moody without any expression at all . He stared at him long enough for the silence to envelop him . Then , without parting his lips , he stuck his tongue into his cheek until his cheek popped out the size of a golf ball . He turned to Fiske and said softly : " How 'd you get up here ? " " Uh . . . we drove , " said Fiske . " Where 's your car ? What 's it look like ? " Fiske hesitated . Then he told him . " You should 've told me sooner , " said Reverend Bacon . " There 's a bad element around here . " He called out , " Hey , Buck ! " Out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sleeves of his work shirt were rolled up . He had tremendous elbows . Reverend Bacon motioned to him , and he came over and bent down and put his hands on his hips , and Reverend Bacon said something in a low voice . The man 's arms created terrific angles where they bent at the elbows . The man stood up and looked very seriously at Reverend Bacon and nodded and started to leave the room . " Oh , Buck , " said Reverend Bacon . Buck stopped and looked around . " And you keep your eye on that car . " Buck nodded again and walked out . Reverend Bacon looked at Fiske . " I hope none of those trifling boys ? anyway , they wo n't fool with Buck . Now , what was I saying ? " All of this was to Fiske . It was as if Moody were no longer in the room .  | " Reverend Bacon , " said Fiske , " I think ? " Reverend Bacon 's intercom buzzed . " Yes ? " A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on 4-7 . " Reverend Bacon turned to a telephone on a little cabinet near his chair . " Hello , Iry . . . Fine , fine . . . No , no . Mostly the APS , All People 's ! Solidarity . We 've got a mayor to defeat in November . . . Not this time , Irv , not this time . This man , all he needs is a shove . But that 's not what I ailed you about . I called you about the Open Gates Employment Coalion . . . I said the Open Gates Employment Coalition . . . How long ? long time , a long time . Do n't you read the newspapers ? . . . Well , hat 's okay . That 's what I called you about .

" iske noticed that Reverend Bacon had no trouble at all pronouncing the ame of one of the most expensive and fashionable restaurants in New ork . " Heh , heh , well , that 's what they told me . Or is it Leicester 's ? " He t that one right , too . Leicester 's was pronounced Lester 's , in the British shion . Reverend Bacon was chuckling and smiling now . Evidently he as having his joke . Fiske was glad to see him smile  --  over anything . Well , what I 'm saying is , in any a those places , did you ever see a black iter ? Did you ? Did you ever see a black waiter ? . . . That 's right , you ver did . You never did . In any of them . And why ? . . . That 's right . e unions , too .

How ? By any means necessary . You 're always king about footage , Irv . Well , I can promise you one thing . You 'll have rage . Do you follow me ? . . . Call Leicester 's ? Sure . Go ahead .. . o , indeed . I do n't mind . " When he hung up , he said , as if talking to himself , " I hope they do call ' em up . " Then he looked at the two young men . " Now ! " he said , as if the time bad come to wrap things up and send everyone on his way . " You fellows what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight of my life . The fight  | . . . of . . . my . . . life . The APS , All People 's Solidarity , in November we got to defeat the most racist mayor in the history of the United States . The Open Gates Employment Coalition , we got to break down the walls of apartheid in the job market . And the Third World AntiDefamation League , we 're negotiating with a bunch of exploiters making a stone racist movie called Harlem 's Angels . Gangs and drug dealers and addicts and winos , that 's all . Racial stereotypes . They think because they got this black man who leads a young gang to Jesus , they are not racist . But they are stone racist , and they must be suitably apprised of that reality . So the day is coming in New York . The hour is drawing nigh . The final battle , you might say . Gideon 's Army . . . and you ! . . . you come up here and lay some chickensh  --  some trifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Shepherd Day Care Center ! " A fury had crept into the baron 's voice . He had come close to uttering the word chickenshit , and Fiske had never known him to say so much as a single foul word , not even a damn , in all the time he had known him . Fiske was torn between the desire to depart this house before the final battle began and the hellfire rained down and the desire to save his job , such as it was . He was the one who had dispatched the $350,000 to Reverend Bacon in the first place . Now he had to retrieve it . " Well , " he said , testing a middle ground , " you may be right , Reverend Bacon . And we  --  the diocese  --  we are not here to complicate things . Frankly , we want to protect you , and we want to protect our investment in you . We gave you $350,000 contingent on the licensing of the day-care center . So if you 'll turn over the $350,000 or the $340,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it into an escrow account , then we 'll help you . We 'll go to bat for you . " Reverend Bacon looked at him distractedly , as if pondering a great decision . " It is not that simple , " he said . " Well  --  why not ? " " That money is mostly . . . committed . " " Committed ? " " To the contractors . " " The contractors ? What contractors ? " " What contractors ? Good Lord , man , the equipment , the furniture , the computers , the telephones , the carpet , the air conditioning , the vent ' . lation  --  very important with children , the ventilation  --  the safety toy .. It 's hard to remember all the things . " " But , Reverend Bacon , " said Fiske , his voice rising , " all you 've got w  | far is an old empty warehouse ! I was just by there ! There 's nothing in there ! You have n't hired an architect ! You do n't even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Coordination is the main thing in a project of this kind . Coordination . " " Coordination ? I do n't see  --  well , that may be , but if you 've made commitments to contractors , then it seems to me you 've just got to explain to them that there 's going to be an unavoidable delay . " Fiske was all at once afraid that he was taking too stern a tone . " If you do n't mind , how much of the money remains in your hands , Reverend Bacon , whether committed or not ? " " None of it , " said Reverend Bacon . " None of it ? How can that be ? " " This was seed money . We had to sow the seed . Some of it fell on fallow ground . " " Sow the seed ? Reverend Bacon , surely you did n't advance these people their money before they did the work ! " " These are minority firms . People from the community . That was what we wanted . Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not advanced ? " " These are not firms with your lines of credit , ' your computerized inventories , ' your pre-staggered cash flows , ' your convertible asset management , ' your capital-sensitive liquidity ratios , ' and all that . These are not firms with factors to go to , like they have in the garment industry , when bad luck knocks on the door with your unavoidable delays ' . . . see . . . These are firms founded by people in the community . These are the tender shoots that sprout up from the seeds we sow  --  you , me , the Episcopal Church , the Gates of the Kingdom Church . Tender shoots . . and you say , unavoidable delay . ' That 's not just a term , that 's not just your red tape  --  that 's a sentence of death . A sentence of death . That 's saying Kindly drop dead . ' So do n't tell me I can just explain it to them . Unavoidable delay . . . Say , unavoidable death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $350,000 ! Surely ? " Fiske looked at Moody . Moody was sitting up straight . He no longer hooked very cool , and he was n't saying a word . " The diocese will  --  there 'll have to be an audit , " said Fiske . " Right away . " " Oh yes , " said Reverend Bacon . " There 'll be an audit . I 'll give you an audit . . . right away . I 'm gon na tell you something . I 'm gon na tell you something about capitalism north of Ninety-sixth Street . Why do you  | people think you 're investing all this money , your $350,000 , in a day-care center in Harlem ? Why are you ? " Fiske said nothing . Reverend Bacon 's Socratic dialogues made him feel childish and helpless . But Bacon insisted . " Now , you go ahead and tell me . I want to hear it from you . Like you say , we 're going to have an audit . An audit . I want to hear it from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this money in a day-care center in Harlem ? Why . " Fiske could n't hold out any longer . " Because day-care centers are desperately needed in Harlem , " he said , feeling about six years old . " No , my friend , " said Bacon softly , " that is not why . If you people were that worried about the children , you would build the day-care center yourself and hire the best professional people to work in it , people with experience . You would n't even talk about hiring the people of the streets . What do the people of the streets know about running a day-care center ? No , my friend , you 're investing in something else . You 're investing in steam control . And you 're getting value for money . Value for money . " " Steam control ? " " Steam control . It 's a capital investment . It 's a very good one . You know what capital is ? You think it 's something you own , do n't you . You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things you can sell and stocks and money and banks and corporations . You think it 's something you own , because you always owned it . You owned all this land . " He waved his arm back toward the bay window and the gloomy back yard and the three sycamore trees . " You owned all the land , and out there , out there in . . . Kansas . . . and . . . Oklahoma . . . everybody just lined up , and they said , ' On the mark , get set , go ! ' and a whole lot of white people started running , and there was all this land , and all they had to do was get to it and stand on it , and they owned it , and their white skin was their deed of property . . . see . . . The red man , he was in the way , and he was eliminated . The yellow man , he could lay rails across it , but then he was shut up in Chinatown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole time anyway . And so you owned it all , and you still own it , and so you think capital is owning things . But you are mistaken . Capital is controlling things . Controlling things . You want land in Kansas ? You want to exercise your white deed of property ? First you got to control Kansas . . . see . . . Controlling things . I do n't suppose you ever worked in a boiler room . I worked in a boiler room . People own the boilers , but that do n't do ' em a bit of good unless they  | know how to control the steam . . . see . . . If you ca n't control .. . the steam , then it 's Powder Valley for you and your whole gang . If you ever see a steam boiler go out of control , then you see a whole lot of people running for their lives . And those people , they are not thinking about that boiler as a capital asset , they are not thinking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the escrow accounts and the audits and the prudent thing . . . see . . . They are saying , Great God almighty , I lost control , ' and they are running for their lives . They 're trying to save their very hides . You see this house ? " He gestured vaguely toward the ceiling . " This house was built in the year nineteen hundred and six by a man named Stanley Lightfoot Bowman . Lightfoot . Turkish towels and damask tablecloths , wholesale , Stanley Lightfoot Bowman . He sold those Turkish towels and damask tablecloths in job lots . He spent almost a half a million dollars on this house in nineteen hundred and six . . . see . . . The man 's initials , S.L.B. , they 're down there made of bronze , going all the way up the stairs , instead a spindles . This was the place to be in nineteen hundred and six . They built these big houses all the way up the West Side , starting at Seventy-second Street , all the way up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  from a Jewish fellow  --  in nineteen hundred and seventy-eight for sixty-two thousand dollars , and that fellow was happy to get that money . He was licking his chops and saying , I got some  --  some fool to give me sixty-two thousand dollars for that place . ' Well , what happened to all those Stanley Lightfoot I Bowmans ? Did they lose their money ? No , they lost control . . . see . . They lost control north of Ninety-sixth Street , and when they lost control , they lost the capital . You understand ? All that capital , it vanished off the face of the earth . The house was still there , but the capital , it vanished . . . see . . . So what I 'm telling you is , you best be waking up . You 're practicing the capitalism of the future , and you do n't even know it . You 're not investing in a day-care center for the children of Harlem . You 're investing in the souls . . . the souls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long to look at it like children any longer , people who 've grown up with a righteous anger in their hearts and a righteous steam building up in their souls , ready to blow . A righteous steam . When you people come up here and talk about minority contractors ' and minority hiring ' and day-care centers for the street people , of the street people , and by the street people , you 're humming the right tune , but you do n't want to sing the right words . You do n't want to come right out and say it : Please , dear Lord , God almighty , let 'm do what they want with the money , just so long 's it controls the steam ... be-  | fore it 's too late . . . Well , you go ahead and have your audit and talk to your HRA and reorganize your boards and cross all the is and dot all the i 's . Meantime , I 've done your investing for you , and thanks to me , you 're already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your audit ! . . . But the time is coming when you will say : ' Thank Gpd . Thank God ! Thank God we entered the money on the books Reverend Bacon 's way ! ' Because I 'm the conservative , whether you know it or not . You do n't know who 's out there on those wild and hungry streets . I am your prudent broker on Judgment Day . Harlem , the Bronx , and Brooklyn , they 're gon na blow , my friend , and on that day , how grateful you will be for your prudent broker . . . your prudent broker . . . who can control the steam . Oh yes . On that day , the owners of capital , how happy they will be to exchange what they own , how happy they will be to give up their very birthrights , just to control that wild and hungry steam . No , you go on back down , and you say , ' Bishop , I 've been uptown , and I 'm here to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent broker . We 're gon na occupy the high ground when it all comes down . " Just then the intercom buzzer sounded again , and the secretary 's voice said : " There 's a Mr. Simpson on the phone , from the Citizens Mutual Insurance Company . He wants to talk to the president of Urban Guaranty Investments . " Reverend Bacon picked up the telephone . " This is Reginald Bacon . . . That 's right , president and chief executive officer . . . That 's right . that 's right . . . Yes , well , I appreciate your interest , Mr. Simpson , but we already brought that issue to market . . . That 's right , the entire issue . . . Oh , absolutely , Mr. Simpson , those school bonds are very popular . Of course , it helps to know that particular market , and that 's what Urban Guaranty Investment is here for . We want to put Harlem in the market . . . That 's right , that 's right , Harlem 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Harlem 's gon na be in the market . . . Thank you , thank you . . . Well , why do n't you try one of our associates downtown . Are you familiar with the firm of Pierce &; Pierce ? . . That 's right . . . They brought a very large block of that issue to market , a very large block . I 'm sure they 'll be happy to do business with you . Urban Guaranty Investments ? Pierce &; Pierce ? Pierce &; Pierce was one of the biggest and hottest investment banking houses on Wall Street . A terrible suspicion invaded Fiske 's ordinarily charitable heart . He cut a glance at Moody , and Moody was looking at him , and , it was obvious . wondering the same thing . Had Bacon shifted $350,000 into this securi-  | operation , whatever in the name of God it actually was ? If the money Mad entered the securities market , then by now it could have vanished ptithout a trace . As soon as Reverend Bacon hung up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'd never heard of  --  well , perhaps you  --  but I do n't think so  --  what 1 ? I could n't help but hear you mention  --  what is Urban Guaranty In-Mestments ? " 4 " Oh , " said Reverend Bacon , " we do a little underwriting , whenever we on help out . No reason why Harlem should always buy retail and sell holesale . . . see . . . Why not make Harlem the broker ? " To Fiske this was pure gibberish . " But where do you get  --  how are you le to finance  --  I mean something like that ? " He could think of no way put this particular lit firecracker into words . The necessary eupheisms eluded him . To his surprise , Moody spoke up again . " I know a little about securities firms , Reverend Bacon , and I know ey require a lot of capital . " He paused , and Fiske could tell that Moody thrashing about in the swollen seas of circumlocution , too . " Well , at I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . You 've ? ' ve just been talking about capital north of Ninety-sixth Street and trolling . . . uh , the steam , as you mentioned . . . but this sounds e straight capitalism , basic capitalism , if you see what I mean . " Reverend Bacon looked at him balefully , then chuckled in his throat d smiled , not with kindness . " It do n't require capital . We 're underwriters . We bring the issues to rket , so long as they 're for the good of the community . . . see . . . ools , hospitals ? " " Yes , but ? " " As Paul knew , there are many roads to Damascus , my friend . Many ds . " Many roads hung in the air , humid with meaning . " Yes , I know , but ? " " If I were you , " said Reverend Bacon , " I would n't worry about Urban ranty Investments . If I were you , I 'd do like the old folks say . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm trying to do , Reverend Bacon , " said Moody . " My itting is  --  well , it amounts to three hundred and fifty thousand dol- Fiske slumped down in his seat again . Moody had regained his fool 's ourage . Fiske cut a glance at the fool killer behind the desk . Just then be intercom buzzed again .  | The secretary 's voice said : " I got Annie Lamb on the line . Says she 's got to talk to you . " " Annie Lamb ? " " That 's right , Reverend . " A big sigh . " All right , I 'll take it . " He picked up the telephone . " An nie ? . . . Annie , wait a minute . Slow down . . . Say what ? Henry ' ' . . . That 's terrible , Annie . How bad is it ? . . Aw , Annie , I 'm sorry . . . He did ? " A long pause , as Reverend Bacon listened , eyes cast down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parking tickets ? That do n't . . . That do n't ? . . . I say , that do n't ? . . . Okay , Annie , look here . You come on over here and you tell me the whole thing . Meantime , I 'm calling the hospital . They did n't do the right thing , Annie . That 's what it sounds like to me . They did not do the right thing . . . What ? . . . You are absolutely right . You 're right as rainwater ' They did not do the right thing , and they 're going to hear from me . Do n't worry . You come right on over here . " Reverend Bacon hung up the telephone and swiveled back toward Fiske and Moody and narrowed his eyes and looked at them gravely . " Gentlemen , I 've got an emergency here . One of my most loyal workers , one of my community leaders , her son 's been struck down by a hit-andrun driver . . . in a Mercedes-Benz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , and this good woman is afraid to go to the police , and do you know why ? Parking tickets . They 've got a warrant out for her arrest for parking tickets . This lady works . She works downtown at City Hall , and she needs that car , and they 've got a warrant out for . . . parking tickets . That would n't stop you if it was your son , but you 've never lived in the ghetto . If it was your son , they would n't do what they did . They would n't wrap up his wrist and send him packing when what he 's got is a concussion and he 's at death 's door . . . see . . . But that 's the story of the ghetto . Gross negligence . That 's what the ghetto is . . . gross negli ? gence . . . Gentlemen , our conference is adjourned . I 've got some serf ous business to tend to now . " On the drive back downtown the two young Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ninety-sixth Street . Fiske was happy enough t have found the car where he had left it , with the tires still inflated and t windshield in one piece . As for Moody  --  twenty blocks had gone by at Fiske had n't heard a peep out of Moody about being a linebacker at Yal Finally , Moody said , " Well , you want to have dinner at Leicester 's ' know the maitre d ' , a big tall black fellow with a gold earring . "  | Fiske smiled faintly but said nothing . Moody 's little joke made Fiske I superior . Part of the presumed humor was the implausibility of the tion that either of them would be dining at Leicester 's , which was this is most fashionable restaurant of the century . Well , it just so haped that Fiske was going to Leicester 's this very evening . Moody also d n't realize that Leicester 's , although fashionable , was not a formal taurant featuring a starched regiment of maitre d 's and captains . It more the British bistro-out-Fulham-Road sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British colony in New York , and Fiske d gotten to know quite a few of them  --  and , well , it was the kind of ing he could never explain to a fellow like Moody , but the British derstood the art of conversation . Fiske considered himself essentially ' fish , British in ancestry and British in . . . well , in a certain innately ? tocratic comprehension of how one conducted one 's life , aristocratic the sense not of the richest but of the best . He was like the great Lord ilbank , was n't he ? ? Philbank , a pillar of the Church of England who used his social connections and his knowledge of the financial mars to help the poor of London 's East End . " Come to think of it , " said Moody , " I never have seen a black waiter t a restaurant in New York , except for lunch counters . You really think on is going to get anywhere ? " " Depends on what you mean by that . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Fiske , " but they want to be waiters at Leicester 's ' tit as much as you and I do . I kind of think they just might settle for a tribution to the Reverend Mr. Bacon 's good works in Harlem , and they 'll move on to the next restaurant . " hen it 's just a payoff , " said Moody . Well , that 's the funny thing , " said Fiske . " Things do change . I 'm not he cares whether they change or not , but they change . Places he r heard of , and would n't care about if he had , they 'll start hiring k waiters rather than wait for Buck and all those characters to turn he steam , " said Moody . I suppose , " said Fiske . " Did n't you just love all that about the boiler ? He 's never worked in any boiler room . But he 's discovered a new ? urce , I guess you could call it . Maybe it 's even a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create more wealth . I do n't , maybe Bacon is no different from Rockefeller or Carnegie . You ever a new resource and you take your money while you 're young ,  | and when you 're old they give you awards and name things after you , and you 're remembered as a leader of the people . " " All right , then what about Urban Guaranty Investments ? That does n't sound like any new resource . " " I would n't be too sure . I do n't know what it is , but I 'm going to find out . I 'm willing to bet you one thing . Whatever it is , it 's going to have some kind of weird angle , and it 's going to drive me a little bit farther around the fucking bend . " Then Fiske bit his lip , because he was in truth a devout Episcopalian and seldom swore and regarded foul language not only as wrong but as common . This was one of quite a few points on which , even at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time they reached Seventy-ninth Street , securely in White Man . hattan , Fiske knew that Bacon was right once more . They were n't investing in a day-care center , were they . . . They were trying to buy souls . They were trying to tranquilize the righteously angry soul of Harlem . Let 's face facts ! Then he snapped out of it . Fiske . . . you idiot . . . If he did n't ma age to retrieve the $350,000 , or most of it , he was going to look like most righteous fool .  | / The telephone blasted Peter Fallow awake inside an egg with the shell peeled away and only the membranous sac holding it intact . All ! The membranous sac was his head , and the right side of his head was on the pillow , and the yolk was as heavy as mercury , and it rolled like mercury , and it was pressing down on his right temple and his right eye and his right ear . If he tried to get up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poisoned mass , would shift and roll and rupture the sac , and his brains would fall out . The telephone was on the floor , in the corner , near the window , on the brown carpet . The carpet was disgusting . Synthetic ; the Americans manufactured filthy carpet ; Metalon , Streptolon , deep , shaggy , with a feel that made his flesh crawl . Another explosion ; he was looking straight at it , a white telephone and a slimy white cord lying there in a filthy shaggy brown nest of Streptolon . Behind the Venetian blinds the sun was so bright it hurt his eyes . The room got light only between one and two in the afternoon , when the sun moved between two buildings on its trip across the southern sky . The other rooms , the bathroom , the kitchen , and the living room , never got any sun at all . The kitchen and the bathroom did n't even have windows . When one turned on the light in the bathroom , which had a plastic tub-and-shower-stall module  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he stepped into the tub ? when one turned on the light in the bathroom , a ceiling fan went on up above a metal grille in the ceiling to provide ventilation . The fan created  | a grinding din and a tremendous vibration . So when he first got up , he no longer turned on the light in the bathroom . He depended solely on the Id , sickly blue dawn provided by the overhead fluorescent light in the passageway outside . More than once he had gone to work without shaving . His head still on the pillow , Fallow kept staring at the telephone , which continued to explode . He really had to get a table to put by the bed , if one could call a mattress and springs on one of those American adjustable metal frames , good for cutting off knuckles and fingers mainly when one tried to adjust them  --  if one could call this a bed . The telephone looked slimy and filthy lying there on the filthy carpet . But he EI never invited anybody up here , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening when he had been through two or three bottles of wine and did n't give a damn . That was n't really true , was it ? When he brought a girl up here , he always saw this pathetic hole through her eyes , at least for a moment . The thought of wine and a girl tripped a wire in his brain , and a shudder of remorse went through his nervous system . Something had happened last night . These days he often woke up like this , poisonously hung over , afraid to move an inch and filled with an abstract feeling of despair and shame . Whatever he had done was submerged like a monster at the bottom of a cold dark lake . His memory had drowned in the night , and he could feel only the icy despair . He had to look for the monster deductively , fathom by fathom . Sometimes he knew that whatever it had been , he could n't face it , and he would decide to turn away I , II from it forever , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signal , and the beast would come popping to the surface on its own IJN and show him its filthy snout . He did remember how it started , namely , at Leicester 's , where , like many of the Englishmen who frequented the place , he managed to insinuate himself at the table of an American who could be counted on to pick ppII up the bill without pouting over it , in this case a fat fellow named Aaron Gutwillig , who had recently sold a simulator-leasing company for twelve million dollars and liked to be invited to parties given by the English colony and the Italian colony in New York . Another Yank , a crude but lll , , l amusing little man named Benny Grillo , who produced so-called news Icy , l documentaries for television , had a head on and wanted to go downtown to the Limelight , a discotheque set up in what used to be an Episcopal church . Grillo was good for the bill at the Limelight , and so he had gone down there with Grillo and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Italian journalist , and Tony Moss , whom he had known at the University of Kent , and Caroline Heftshank , who had just  | arrived from London and was absolutely petrified with fear of street crime in New York , which she read about every day in London , and she jumped at every shadow , which was funny at first . The two model girls had ordered roast-beef sandwiches at Leicester 's , and they pulled the meat out and dangled it above their mouths and ate it out of their fingers . Caroline Heftshank jumped a lot when they got out of the taxi in front of the Limelight . The place was practically ringed by black youths wearing enormous sneakers and perching on the old iron church fence , eyeing the drunks and heads going in and out of the door . Inside , the Limelight looked unusually grotesque , and Fallow felt unusually witty , drunk , and charming . So many transvestities ! So many supremely repulsive punkers ! So many pasty-faced little American girls with ortho-perfect teeth and silver lipstick and wet-night eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foggy grainy videotapes up on the screens full of morose skinny boys and smoke bombs ! Deeper and deeper into the lake it had all gone . They were in a taxi going back and forth across streets in the West Fifties looking for a place with a galvanized-metal door , called the Cup . A black studded rubber floor , and some loathsome Irish boys with no shirts on , or they looked Irish , spraying beer out of cans over everybody ; and then some girls with no shirts on . Ah . Something had happened in front of some people in a room . Insofar as he had a true memory of it , he did remember that . . . Why did he do these things ? . . . The house in Canterbury . . . the locker room at Cross Keys . . . He could see himself as he looked back then . . . his Victorian-picturehook blond hair , of which he had been so proud . . . his long pointed nose , his long slender jaw , his spindly body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had also been so proud . . . his spindly body . . . A ripple . . . The monster was heading up from the bottom of the lake ! In a moment . . . its filthy snout ! Ca n't face it The telephone exploded again . He opened his eyes and squinted at the sun-drenched modern squalor , and with his eyes open it was even worse . With his eyes open  --  the immediate future . Such hopelessness ! Such icy despair ! He squinted and shuddered and closed his eyes again . The snout ! He opened them immediately . This thing he had done when he was 0 very drunk  --  in addition to despair and remorse , he now felt fear . The ringing telephone began to alarm him . Suppose it was The City light . After the Dead Mouse 's last lecture , he had sworn to himself to be at the office by ten o'clock every morning , and it was now after one . In that case  --  he 'd better not answer it . No  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sink to the bottom forever , along with the monster . He rolled out of the bed and put his feet on the floor , and the horrible yolk shifted . He was thrown into a violent headache . He wanted to vomit , but he knew it would hurt his head too much for him to possibly allow it to happen . He started toward the telephone . He sank to his knees and then to all fours . He crawled to the telephone , picked up the receiver , and then lay down on the carpet , hoping the yolk would settle again . " Hello , " he said . " Peter ? " Pee-tuh ? Thank God , it was an English voice . " Yes ? " " Peter , you 're gurgling . I woke you up , did n't I. This is Tony . " " No , no , no , no , no . I 'm  --  I was , I was in the other room . I 'm working at home today . " He realized that his voice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a very good imitation of having just woke up . " " You do n't believe me , do you ? " Thank God it was Tony . Tony was an Englishman who had come to work on The City Light at the same time he had . They were fellow commandos in this gross country . " Of course I believe you . But that puts me in the minority just now . If I were you , I 'd come down here as soon as I could . " " Ummmmmm . Yes . " " The Mouse just came over and asked me where you were . Not out of curiosity , either . He acted extremely pissed . " " What did you tell him ? " " I told him you were at the Surrogate 's Court . " " Ummmm . Not to pry , but what am I doing there ? " " Great Christ , Peter , I really did get you out of bed , did n't I ? That Lacey Putney business . " " Ummmmmmm . Lacey Putney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head like a Hawaiian wave . His head was flat on the carpet . The poisonous yolk sloshed about terribly . " Ummmmmmmmmmm . " " Do n't fade out on me , Peter . I 'm not joking . I think you should come down here and put in an appearance . " " I know , I know I know I know I know . Thanks , Tony . You 're absolutely right . " " Are you coming ? " " Yes . " Even as he said it , he knew what it was going to feel like to try to stand up . " And do me a favor . " " Anything . "  | " Try to remember that you were at the Surrogate 's Court . The Lacey Putney estate . Not that the Mouse necessarily believed me . But , you know . " " Yes . Lacey Putney . Thanks , Tony . " Fallow hung up , got up off the floor , staggered into the Venetian blinds , and cut his lip . The slats were the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wiped the blood off his lip with the back of his index finger . He could n't hold his head up straight . The mercury yolk ruined his sense of balance . He lurched to the bathroom and entered by the tubercular blue dawn of the fluorescent light in the passageway outside . In the mirror on the medicine cabinet door , in this diseased light , the blood on his lip looked purple . That was all right . He could live with urple blood . But if he turned on the light in the bathroom , he was nished . Rows of diode-light computer terminals in putty-gray 2001 sci-fi casgs lent the city room of The City Light a gloss of order and modernity. t never survived a second glance . The desks were covered in the usual tter of paper , plastic cups , books , manuals , almanacs , magazines , and ty ashtrays . The usual shell-backed young men and women sat at the yboards . A numb dull clattering  --  thuk thuk thuk thuk thuk thuk thuk uk thuk thuk thuk thuk thuk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mah-jongg tournament was in progress . The reporters , rewrite en , and copy editors were hunched over in the age-old way of journals . Every few seconds a head would straighten up , as if coming up for , and yell out something about slugs , headline counts , or story lengths . t not even the excitement of deadline pressure could survive for long . rear door opened , and a Greek wearing a white uniform came staggerin carrying a prodigious tray full of coffee and soda containers , boxes doughnuts , cheese Danishes , onion rolls , crullers , every variety of ck and lard known to the takeout food business , and half the room rted the computer consoles and descended upon him , rooting about tray like starving weevils . Fallow took advantage of this hiatus to make his way across the room and his cubicle . Out in the middle of the field of computer terminals , stopped and , with an air of professional scrutiny , picked up a copy of second edition , which had just been brought upstairs . Below the logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital letters ning down the right side ?  | ? and a photograph running down the left . The photograph was a cropped blowup of the sort of smiling lineless portrait that studios produce . It was a picture of a woman named Carolina Perez , fifty-five years old and not particularly grandmotherly , with a luxuriant head of black hair pulled up behind in the old-fashioned Lady of Spain style . Christ God ! Scalping her must have been an undertaking ! Had he been feeling better , Fallow would have paid a silent tribute to the extraordinary esthetique de l'abattoir that enabled these shameless devils , his employers , his compatriots , his fellow Englishmen , his fellow progeny of Shakespeare and Milton , to come up with things like this day after day . Just think of the fine sense of gutter syntax that inspired them to create a headline that was all verbs and objects , with the subject missing , the better to make you claw your way inside these smeary black pages to find out what children of evil were fiendish enough to complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled some reporter to invade chez Perez and extract a picture of Granny that made you feel the bloody act in your fingertips  --  in your very shoulder joints ! Just think of the anticlimax of " scalp Grandma " . . . " then rob her . " The pointless brilliant anticlimax ! Christ , if they 'd had more room , they would have added , " then leave all the lights on in her kitchen . " At the moment , however , he was too poisonously ill to enjoy it . No , he stood there staring at this latest bit of tabloid genius only to establish the fact , for all to see  --  and most especially , he hoped , the Dead Mouse himself  --  that he was on the premises and interested in little else in the world other than the New York City Light . Holding the newspaper in his hands and staring at the front page , as if transfixed by the virtuosity of it , he walked the rest of the way across the room and entered his cubicle . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , a so-called work station with little high-tech curves at the corners , fencing in a gray metal desk , the ubiquitous computer terminal and keyboard , a plastic desk chair molded in an unpleasant orthopedic fashion and a modular plastic coatrack , which snapped ingeniously onto the modular wall . It was already cracked in thi stem . On the rack hung a single drab garment , Peter Fallow 's raincoat , which never left the cubicle .  | Just by the coatrack was a window , and he could see his reflection . ead on , he looked a young and handsome thirty-six rather than fortyish d gone to seed . Head on , his widow 's peak and the longish wavy blond : it that flowed back from it still looked . . . well , Byronic . . . rather an a bit lonely on the dome of his skull . Yes , at this head-on angle . . . was going to be all right ! His long thin nose looked patrician from top bottom rather than too bulbous in the tip . His big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were forming on either side . ' s navy blazer , which had been made by Blades eight  --  no , ten ! ? years o was getting a little . . . shiny . . . on the lapels . . . but he could ? bably raise the nap with one of those wire brushes . . . He had the ginnings of a belly and was getting too fleshy in the hips and thighs . t this would be no problem now that he was finished with drinking . ever again . He would begin an exercise regimen tonight . Or tomorrow , any case ; he felt too bilious to think about tonight . It would n't be this thetic American business of jogging , either . It would be something n , crisp , brisk , strenuous . . . English . He thought of medicine balls d exercise ladders and leather horses and Indian clubs and pulley ights and parallel bars and stout ropes with leather bindings on the d , and then he realized that these were the apparatus of the gymnasium Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of t . Dear God . . . twenty years ago . But he was still only thirty-six , ? he was six-foot-two , and he had a perfectly sound physique , fundantally . He pulled in his stomach and drew a deep breath . It made him feel szy . He picked up the telephone and put the receiver to his ear . Look : y ! That was the main idea . He found the dial tone soothing . He hed he could crawl inside the receiver and float on his back in the dial e and let the hum of it wash over his nerve endings . How easy it uld be to put his head down on the desk and close his eyes and catch y winks . Perhaps he could get away with it if he put one side of his down on the desk , with the back of his head to the city room , and t the telephone over his other ear as if he were talking . No , it would look strange . Perhaps . . . h , Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oilers , was heading for the cubicle . Goldman had on a necktie with ' d red , yellow , black , and sky-blue diagonal stripes . The Yanks called ? bogus regimental ties " rep " ties . The Yanks always wore neckties leapt out in front of their shirts , as if to announce the awkwardness follow . Two weeks ago he had borrowed a hundred dollars from  | Goldman . He had told him he had to repay a gambling debt by nightfall ? backgammon  --  the Bracers ' Club  --  fast European crowd . The Yanks had very big eyes for stories of Rakes and Aristocrats . Since then , the little shit had already pestered him three times for the money , as if his future on this earth turned on a hundred dollars . The receiver still at his ear , Fallow glanced at the approaching figure , and the blazing tie that heralded him , with contempt . Like more than one Englishman in New York , he looked upon Americans as hopeless children whom Providence had perversely provided with this great swollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve them of their riches , short of violence , was sporting , if not morally justifiable , since they would only squander it in some tasteless and useless fashion , in any event . Fallow began talking into the receiver , as if deep in conversation . He searched his poisoned brain for the sort of one-sided dialogue playwrights have to come up with for telephone scenes . " What 's that ? . . . You say the surrogate refuses to allow the stenographer to give us a transcript ? Well , you tell him . . . Right , right . . . Of course . . . It 's an absolute violation . . . No , no . . . Now listen carefully . . . " The necktie  --  and Goldman  --  were standing right beside him . Peter Fallow kept his eyes down and lifted one hand , as if to say , " Please ! This call can not be interrupted . " " Hello , Pete , " said Goldman . Pete ! he said , and not very cheerily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth on edge . This . . . appalling . . . Yank . . . familiarity ' And cuteness ! The Yanks ! ? with their Arnies and Buddies and Hanks and . . . Petes ! And this lubberly gauche lout with his screaming necktie has the gall to walk into one 's office while one is on the telephone , because he 's a nervous wreck over his pathetic hundred dollars ! ? and call one Pete ! Fallow screwed his face into a look of great intensity and began talking a mile a minute . " So ! . . . You tell the surrogate and the stenographer that we want the transcript by noon tomorrow ! . . . Of course ! . . . It 's obvious ' . . . This is something her barrister has cooked up ! They 're all thick as thieves over there ! " " It 's ' judge , ' " said Goldman tonelessly . Fallow flicked his eyes up toward the American with a furious black look . Goldman stared back with a faintly ironic twist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' they say court reporter . ' And they do n't say barrister , ' although they 'll know what you mean . " Fallow closed his eyes and his lips into three tight lines and shook his head and flapped his hand , as if confronted by an intolerable display of impudence . But when he opened his eyes , Goldman was still there . Goldman looked down at him and put a look of mock excitement on his face and raised both hands and lifted his ten fingers straight up in front of Fallow and then made two fists and popped the ten fingers straight up again and repeated this gesture ten times  --  and said , " One hundred big ones , Pete , " and turned and walked back out into the city room . The impudence ! The impudence ! Once it was clear the impudent little wet smack was n't returning , Fallow put down the receiver and stood up and went over to the coatrack . He had vowed  --  but Christ God ! What he had just been subjected to was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . . . much . Without removing it from the hook , he opened the raincoat and put his head inside it , as if he were inspecting the seams . Then he brought the raincoat around his shoulders so that the upper half of his body disappeared from view . It was the kind of raincoat that has slash pockets with openings on the inside as well as the outside , so that in the rain you can get to your jacket or pants without unbuttoning the coat in front . Beneath his poplin tent , Fallow felt around for the inside opening of the lefthand pocket . From the pocket he withdrew a pint-sized camping canteen . He unscrewed the top , put the opening to his lips , and took two long gulps of vodka and waited for the jolt in his stomach . It hit and then bounced up through his body and his head like a heat wave . He screwed the top back on and slipped the canteen back in the pocket and emerged from the raincoat . His face was on fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary look toward the city room , and Oh shit . ? the Dead Mouse was looking straight at hire . Fallow did n't dare so much as blink , much less smile . He wanted to provoke no response in the Mouse whatsoever . He turned away as if he had n't seen him . Was vodka truly odorless ? He devoutly hoped so . He sat down at the desk and picked up the telephone again and moved his lips . The dial tone hummed , but he was too nervous to surrender himself to it . Had the Mouse seen him under the raincoat ? And if he had , would he guess anything ? Oh , how different that little nip had been from those glorious toasts of six months ago ! Oh , what glorious prospects he had pissed away ! le could see the scene . . . the dinner at the Mouse 's grotesque flat on  | Park Avenue . . . the pompous , overformal invitation cards with the raised script : Sir Gerald Steiner and Lady Steiner request the pleasure of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner and Mr. Peter Fallow written in by hand ) . . . the ludicrous museum of Bourbon Louis furniture and threadbare Aubusson rugs the Dead Mouse and Lady Mouse had put together on Park Avenue . Nevertheless , what a heady evening that had been ! Everyone at the table had been English . There were only three or four Americans in the upper echelons of The City Light anyway , and none was invited . There were dinners like this all over the East Side of Manhattan every night , he had soon discovered , lavish parties that were all English or all French or all Italian or all European ; no Americans , in any case . One had the sense of a very rich and very suave secret legion that had insinuated itself into the cooperative apartment houses of Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue , from there to pounce at will upon the Yanks ' fat fowl , to devour at leisure the last plump white meat on the bones of capitalism . In England , Fallow had always thought of Gerald Steiner as " that Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had vanished . They were comrades-in-arms in the secret legion , in the service of Great Britain 's wounded chauvinism . Steiner had told the table what a genius Fallow was . Steiner had been swept off his feet by a series on country life among the rich that Fallow had done for the Dispatch . It had been full of names and titles and helicopters and perplexing perversions ( " that thing with the cup " ) and costly diseases , and all of it was so artfully contrived as to be fireproof in terms of libel . It had been Fallow 's greatest triumph as a journalist ( his only one , in point of fact ) , and Steiner could n't imagine how he had pulled it off . Fallow knew exactly how , but he managed to hide the memory of it with the embroideries of vanity . Every spicy morsel in the series came from a girl he was seeing at that time , a resentful little girl named Jeannie Brokenborough , a rare-book dealer 's daughter who ran with the Country Set as the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Fallow 's daily magic vanished with her . Steiner 's invitation to New York had arrived just in time , although Fallow did not see it that way . Like every writer before him who has ever scored a triumph , even on the level of the London Dispatch , Fallow was willing to give no credit to luck . Would he have any trouble repeating his triumph in a city he knew nothing about , in a country he looked upon as a stupendous joke ? Well . . . why should he ? His genius had only begun to flower . This was only journalism , after all , a cup of tea on the way to his eventual triumph as a novelist . Fallow 's father , Ambrose Fallow , was  | a novelist , a decidedly minor novelist , it had turned out . His father and his mother were from East Anglia and had been the sort of highly educated young people of good blood and good bone who after the Second World War had been susceptible to the notion that literary sensitivity could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never far from their minds , nor from Fallow 's . Fallow had tried to make up for his lack of money by being a wit and a rake . These aristocratic accomplishments had gained him nothing more than an insecure place in the tail of the comet of the smart crowd in London . Now , as part of the Steiner brigade in New York , Fallow was also going to make his fortune in the fat white-meat New World . People wondered why Steiner , who had no background in journalism , had come to the United States and undertaken the extremely costly business of setting up a tabloid newspaper . The smart explanation was that The City Light had been created as the weapon of attack or reprisal for Steiner 's much more important financial investments in the United States , where he was already known as " the Dread Brit . " But Fallow knew it was the other way around . The " serious " investments existed at e service of The City Light . Steiner had been reared , schooled , drilled , d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pompous self-made ancier who wanted to turn his son into a proper British peer , not just a h Jewish boy . Steiner fils had become the well-mannered , well-eduted , well-dressed , proper mouse his father required . He had never and the courage to rebel . Now , late in life , he had discovered the world the tabloids . His daily dive into the mud  --  SCALP GRANDMA , THEN B HER  --  brought him inexpressible joy . Uhuru ! Free at last ! Every day rolled up his sleeves and plunged into the life of the city room . Some ys he wrote headlines himself . It was possible that he had written ALP GRANDMA , although that had the inimitable touch of his manageditor , a Liverpool prole named Brian Highridge . Despite the many tories of his career , however , he had never been a social success . This s largely due to his personality , but anti-Jewish sentiment was not d , either , and he could not discount it altogether . In any case , he ked with genuine relish upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the nobs who looked down on him . And so waited . . . And waited . At first , Fallow 's expense account , which was far larger n any other City Light writer 's ( not counting the rare foreign assignt ) , caused no concern . After all , to penetrate the high life one had to it , to some extent . The staggering lunch bills , dinner bills , and bar  | bills were followed by amusing reports of the swath Mr. Peter Fallow was cutting as a jolly Brit giant in fashionable low dives . After a while they were not amusing anymore . No great coup in the chronicling of the high life was forthcoming from this particular soldier of fortune . More than once , Fallow had turned in stories only to find them reduced to unsigned column items the following day . Steiner had called him in for several progress reports . These chats had become chillier and chillier . His pride wounded , Fallow had begun entertaining his colleagues by referring to Steiner , the renowned " Dread Brit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enormously . After all , Steiner did have a long pointed nose like a mouse and no chin and a crumpled little mouth and large ears and tiny hands and feet and eyes in which the light seemed to have gone out and a tired little voice . Recently , however , Steiner had become downright cold and abrupt , and Fallow began to wonder if in fact he somehow had learned of the Dead Mouse crack . He looked up . . . there was Steiner , six feet away in the doorway to the cubicle , looking straight at him , one hand resting on a modular wall . " Nice of you to pay us a visit , Fallow . " Fallow ! It was the most contemptuous sort of school-proctor stulfi Fallow was speechless . " Well , " said Steiner , " what do you have for me ? " Fallow opened his mouth . He ransacked his poisoned brain in search of the facile conversation for which he was renowned and came up gasping and sputtering . " Well ! ? you 'll remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'm not mistaken  --  they 've tried to give us a very hard time at the Surrogate 's Court , the  --  the ? " Damn ! Was it stenographers or something about reporters ? What had Goldman said ? " Well ! ? I hardly  --  but I 've really got the whole thing now ! It 's just a matter of  --  I can tell you ? this is really going to break open . . . Steiner did n't even wait for him to finish . " I sincerely hope so , Fallow , " he said quite ominously . " I sincerely hope so . " Then he left and plunged back into his beloved tabloid city room . Fallow sank down into his chair . He managed to wait almost a full minute before he got up and disappeared into his raincoat . Albert Teskowitz was not what Kramer or any other prosecutor would call a threat when it came to swaying a jury with the magic of his summations . Emotional crescendos were beyond him , and even what rhetori-  | cal momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His posture was so bad that every woman on a jury , or every good mother , in any case , was aching to cry out , " Hold your shoulders back ! " As for his delivery , it was n't that he did n't prepare his summations , it was that he obviously prepared them on a yellow legal pad , which lay on top of the defense table . " Ladies and gentlemen , the defendant has three children , ages six , seven , and nine , " Teskowitz was saying , " and they are in the courtroom at this moment , awaiting the outcome of this trial . " Teskowitz avoided calling his client by name . If he could have said Herbert Cantrell , Mr. Cantrell , or even Herbert , it would have been all right , but Herbert would n't put up even with Herbert . " My name is not Herbert , " he told Teskowitz when he first took the case . " I am not your limo driver . My name is Herbert 92X . " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Teskowitz continued , " but a workingman with a job and a family . " He hesitated and turned his face upward with the far , far , far-off expression of someone about to have an epileptic seizure . " A job and a mily , " he repeated dreamily , a thousand miles away . Then he turned on is heels and went to the defense table and bent his already stooped torso t the waist and stared at his yellow legal pad with his head cocked to ne side , like a bird eyeing a wormhole . He held that pose for what med like an eternity and then walked back to the jury box and said , " lie was not an aggressor . He was not attempting to settle a score or make a score or get even with anybody . He was a workingman with a job and a family who was concerned with only one thing , and that he had 4every right to , which was his life was in danger . " The little lawyer 's eyes opened up like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alked back to the defense table and stared at the yellow pad some more . nt over the way he was , he had a silhouette like a slop-sink spigot . . . slop-sink spigot . . . a dog with the chuck horrors . . . Rogue im.es began to seep into the jurors ' minds . They began to be aware of ings such as the film of dust on the huge courtroom windows and the ay the dying afternoon sun lit up the dust , as if it were that kind of stic they make toys out of , the kind that picks up light , and every wsekeeper on the jury , even the bad ones , wondered why somebody did n't wash those windows . They wondered about many things and ipbout almost anything other than what Albert Teskowitz was saying ut Herbert 92X , and above all they wondered about the yellow legal  | pad , which seemed to have Teskowitz 's poor bent scrawny neck on a leash . and find this defendant . . . not guilty . " When Teskowitz finally completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . Their eyes were pinned on the yellow legal pad . They expected it to jerk him back to the table once more . Even Herbert 92X , who had n't missed a beat , looked puzzled . Just then a low chant began in the courtroom . " Yo-ohhhhhhh . . . " It came from over here . " Yo-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh . . . " It came from over there . Kaminsky , the fat officer , started it , and then Bruzzielli , the clerk , picked it up , and even Sullivan , the court reporter , who was sitting at his stenotype machine just below the brow of Kovitsky 's bench , joined in with his own low discreet version . " Yo-ohhh . " Without batting an eye Kovitsky tapped his gavel and declared a thirty-minute recess . Kramer did n't think twice about it . It was wagon-train time at the fortress , that was all . Wagon-training was standard practice . If a trial was likely to run past sundown , then you had to wagon-train . Everybody rt knew that . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the defense had just completed its summation , and the judge could n't adjourn for the night without letting the prosecution make its summation . So it was time to wagon-train . During a wagon-train recess , all employees who had driven to work and who had to stay on at the courthouse after dark because of the trial got up and went outside and headed for their cars in the parking lots . The judge , Kovitsky , was no exception . Today he had driven himself to work , and he went to his robing room , which was through a door to one side of the bench , where he took off his black robe and headed for the parking lot , like everybody else . Kramer had no car , and he could n't afford to pay eight or ten dollars to take a gypsy cab home . The gypsies  --  many of them driven by recent African immigrants , from places like Nigeria and Senegal  --  were the only cabs that came near the courthouse day or night , except for the taxis that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers switched on the OFF DUTY sign even before the brake pedal took its first bite of friction out of the drum , dropped off their fares , and then sped off . No , with a slight chill around the heart , Kramer realized that this was one of those nights when he would have to walk three blocks to the 161st Street subway station in the dark and stand there and wait on  | what was rated as one of the ten most dangerous subway platforms in the ( lOity , in terms of crime , and hope there was a car full enough of people so that he would n't be picked off by the wolf packs like some stray calf from the herd . He figured the Nike running shoes gave him at least half a gjghting chance . For a start , they were camouflage . On the subway in the ronx , a pair of Johnston &; Murphy leather business shoes labeled you a prime target right off the bat . It was like wearing a sign around your k saying ROB ME . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them think twice . They might take him for a plainclothes cop the way home . There no longer existed a plainclothes cop in the Bronx ho did n't wear sneakers . The other thing was , if the evil shit ever did in down , with the Nikes he could at least run for it or dig in and fight . e was n't about to mention any of this to Andriutti and Caughey . Andriti he did n't really give a damn about , but Caughey 's contempt he knew could n't stand . Caughey was Irish and would have sooner taken a let in the face than wear fucking camouflage on the subway . As the jurors headed back to the jury room , Kramer stared at Miss Ily Thomas until he could feel the smoothness of her brown lipstick as walked past , and she looked at him for an instant  --  with just a trace of mile ! ? and he began to agonize over how she would get home , and e was nothing he could do about it , since of course he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to her . Even with all this yohhhing no one ever informed the jury or the witnesses about wagonning , not that a juror would be allowed to go to a parking lot during a I recess , in any case . Kramer went downstairs to the Walton Avenue entrance , to stretch his , get some air , and watch the parade . Out on the sidewalk one group , Iuding Kovitsky and his law clerk , Mel Herskowitz , had already ed . The court officers were with them , standing around like troop ers . The big tub , Kaminsky , was on his tiptoes , craning around , to if there was anybody else who wanted to come along . The parking lot ored by the courthouse regulars was just over the crest of the Grand course and down the slope , on 161st Street , in an enormous dirt pit s from the Criminal Courts Building . The pit , which occupied an re city block , had been dug as the excavation for a building project t never went up . e group assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the rear . The court officers had their .38s plainly ble on their hips . The little contingent headed off bravely into Indian try . It was about 5:45 . Walton Avenue was quiet . There was n't much  | of a rush hour in the Bronx . The parking spaces on Walton Avenue next to the fortress were at a 90-degree angle to the curb . Only a handful of cars remained . There were ten reserved spaces near the entrance , for Abe Weiss , Louis Mastroiani , and other supreme bearers of the Power in the Bronx . The guard at the door put Day-Glo-red plastic traffic cones in the spaces when the appointed users were away . Kramer noticed that Abe Weiss 's car was still there . There was one other , which he did n't recognize , but the other spaces were vacant . Kramer walked back and forth on the sidewalk near the entrance with his head down and his hands in his pockets , concentrating on his summation . He was here to speak for the one principal in this case who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the deceased , Nestor Cabrillo , a good father and a good citizen of the Bronx . It all fell into place very easily . Brick-wall arguments would n't be enough , however ; not for what he had to achieve . This summation had to move her , move her to tears or awe or , at the very least , to utter inebriation from a crime-high in the Bronx , featuring a tough young assistant D.A . with a golden tongue and a fearless delivery , not to mention a hell of a powerful neck . So he walked up and down the sidewalk outside the Walton Avenue entrance to the fortress , cooking Herbert 92X 's goose and tensing his sternocleidomastoid muscles while a vision of the girl with brown lipstick danced in his head . Pretty soon the first of the cars arrived . Here came Kovitsky in his huge ancient white boat , the Pontiac Bonneville . He nosed into one of the reserved spaces near the door . Thwop ! The huge door torqued , and he got out , an inconspicuous-looking little bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here came Bruzzielli in some little Japanese sports car that he seemed about to burst out of . Then Mel Herskowitz and Sullivan , the court reporter . Then Teskowitz in a new Buick Regal . Shit , thought Kramer . Even Al Teskowitz can afford a car . Even him , an 18b lawyer , and I 'm going home on the subway ! Pretty soon practically every space on the Walton Avenue side of the building was filled by the regulars . The last car to pull in was Kaminsky 's own . He had given the other court officer a lift back . The two of them got out , and Kaminsky spotted Kramer and broke into a good-natured grin and sang out , " Yo-ohhhhhh ? hhhhhhhhhhhh ! " " Yo ho ho , " said Kramer . The wagon train . " Yo-ohhhhhhh " was the cry of John Wayne , the hero and chief scout , signaling the pioneers to move the wagons . This w Indian country and bandit country , and it was time to put the wagons a circle for the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | walk two blocks from Gibraltar to the parking lot after dark in the Fourfour and drive peacefully home to Mom and Buddy and Sis was playing the game of life with half a deck . Late in the day , Sherman got a call from Arnold Parch 's secretary saying Parch wanted to see him . Parch had the title executive vice president , but he was not the sort who very often summoned people from the trading floor into his office . Parch 's office was , naturally , smaller than Lopwitz 's , but it had the same terrific view to the west , out over the Hudson River and New Jersey . In contrast to Lopwitz 's office , with its antiques , Parch 's was done with modern furniture and large modern paintings of the sort that Maria and her husband liked . Parch , who was a great smiler , smiled and motioned to a gray upholstered chair that was so sleek and close to the floor it looked like a submarine surfacing . Sherman sank down until he had the sensation of being below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across from him . Sherman was conscious mainly of legs , his and Parch 's . In Sherman 's line of vision , Parch 's chin barely cleared the tops of his knees . " Sherman , " said the smiling face behind the kneetops , " I just received a call from Oscar Suder in Columbus , Ohio , and he is really pissed off about these United Fragrance bonds . " Sherman was astounded . He wanted to lift his head up higher , but he could n't . " He is ? And he called you ? What did he say ? " " He said you called him and sold him three million bonds at 102 . He also said you told him to buy them fast , because they were heading up . This morning they 're down to 100 . " " Par ! I do n't believe it ! " " Well , it 's a fact , and they 're going lower , if they 're going anywhere . Standard &; Poor 's just knocked them down from double A to triple B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arnold ! I saw them go from 103 to 102.5 day before yesterday , and I checked with Research , and everything was okay . Then yesterday they went down to 102 , then 1017/8 , and then they came back up to 102 . So I figured other traders were spotting it , and that 's when I called Oscar . They were heading back up . It was a damned good bargain at 102 . Oscar had been looking for something over 9 , and here was 9.75 , almost 10 , double A. " " But did you check with Research yesterday , before you got them for car ? "  | " No , but they went up another eighth after I bought them . They were going up . I 'm bowled over by all this . Par ! It 's unbelievable . " " Well , golly , Sherman , " said Parch , who was no longer smiling , " ca n't you see what was happening ? Somebody at Salomon was painting you a picture . They were loaded with U Frags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , and so they painted a picture . They lowered the price two days ago , looking for nibbles . Then they brought it back up to make it look like there was some trading going on . Then they lowered it again yesterday and they pulled it up . Then when they got your nibble  --  quite a nice little nibble  --  they raised the price again , to see if you 'd nibble again at 1021/8 . You and Solly were the whole market , Sherman ! Nobody else was touching it . They painted you a picture . Now Oscar 's out $60,000 and he 's got three million triple B 's he does n't want . " A terrible clear light . Of course it was true . He had let himself be suckered in the most amateurish fashion . And Oscar Suder , of all people ! Oscar , whom he was counting on as part of the Giscard package . . . only $10 million out of $600 million , but that was $10 million he 'd have to find somewhere else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Sherman . " You 're absolutely right . I goofed . " He realized goofed sounded as if he were letting himself off easy . " It was a stupid blunder , Arnold . I should 've seen it coming . " He shook his head . " Boy . Oscar , of all people . I wonder if I should call him my-self ? " " I would n't just yet . He 's really pissed off . He wanted to know if you or anybody else here knew the S &P; report was coming . I said no , because I knew you would n't pull anything on Oscar . But in fact Research did know about it . You should 've checked with ' em , Sherman . After all , three million bonds . . . Parch smiled the smile of no-hard-feelings . He obviously did n't like sessions like this himself . " It 's okay . It happens ; it happens . But you 're our number one man out there , Sherman . " He lifted his eyebrows and kept them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You get the picture ? " He hauled himself up from out of his chair . Likewise , Sherman . With n , 111 considerable embarrassment Parch extended his hand , and Sherman shook it . " Okay , go get ' em , " Parch said with a large but flat smile . The distance from where Kramer stood at the prosecution table to where Herbert 92X sat at the defense table was no more than twenty feet to begin with . Kramer took a couple of steps closer , narrowing the gap  | until everybody in the courtroom could tell that something odd was taking place without being able to tell exactly what . He had reached the part where it was time to demolish whatever pity for Herbert that Teskowitz might have managed to create . I " Now , I know we 've heard certain things about the personal history of Herbert 92X , " said Kramer , facing the jury , " and here Herbert 92X sits today , in this courtroom . " Unlike Teskowitz , Kramer threw the name Herbert 92X into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sci-fi movie robot . Then he pivoted and lowered his head and stared Herbert in the face and said , " Yes , here is Herbert 92X . . . in perfect health ! . . . full of energy ! . . . ready to return to the streets and resume his life , in the Herbert 92X style which involves carrying a concealed unlicensed illegal .38-caliber revolver ! " Kramer looked Herbert 92X in the eye . He was now barely ten feet away from him , and he hurled health , energy , and resume in his teeth , as if he personally was ready to remove the man 's health , energy , and potential for the resumption of a workaday life or life of any sort , for that matter , with his bare hands . Herbert was not one to shrink from a challenge . He contemplated Kramer with a cool smile on his face that as much as said , " Just keep on talking , sucker , because I 'm going to count ten and then . . . squash you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve looked as if he was close enough to reach out and throttle him and , n top of that , eager to throttle him . That did n't worry Kramer . He was eked up by three court officers who were already in high spirits from e thought of the overtime pay they would be getting for the evening 's ork . So let Herbert sit there in his Arab outfit and look as tough as he wants ! The tougher Herbert looked in the eyes of the jury , the better it was for Kramer 's case . And the more dangerous he looked in the eyes of Miss Shelly Thomas  --  the more heroic the aura of the fearless young rosecutor ! The truly incredulous person was Teskowitz . His head was going back d forth slowly , like a lawn sprinkler . He could n't believe the perforance he was witnessing . If Kramer was going after Herbert this way in is piece a shit , what the hell would he do if he had a real killer on his nds ? " Well , ladies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ry but remaining just as close to Herbert , " it is my duty to speak for meone who is not sitting before us in this courtroom , because he was uck down and killed by a bullet from a revolver in the possession of a n he had never seen before in his life , Herbert 92X . I would remind  | you that the issue in this trial is not the life of Herbert 92X but the death of Nestor Cabrillo , a good man , a good citizen of the Bronx , a good husband , a good father .. . of five children . . . cut down in the prime of his life because of Herbert 92X 's arrogant belief . . . that he is entitled to conduct his business with a concealed , unlicensed , illegal .38-caliber revolver in his possession . . . " Kramer let his eyes grace each juror , one by one . But at the end of each orotund period they came to rest upon her . She was sitting next to the end on the left side in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward , perhaps even a little obvious . But life is short ! And , my God ! ? such a flawless white face ! ? such a luxurious corona of hair ! ? such perfect lips with brown lipstick ! And such an admiring gleam did he now detect in those big brown eyes ! Miss Shelly Thomas was roaring drunk , high on crime in the Bronx . Out on the sidewalk , Peter Fallow could see the cars and taxis speeding uptown on West Street . Christ God , how he longed to be able to crawl into a taxi and go to sleep until he reached Leicester 's . No ! What was he thinking ? No Leicester 's tonight ; not a drop of alcohol in any form . Tonight he was going straight home . It was getting dark . He 'd give anything for a taxi . . . to curl up in a taxi and go to sleep and head straight home . . . But the ride would be nine or ten dollars , and he had less than seventy-five dollars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in New York seventy-five dollars was nothing , a mere sigh , a deep breath , a passing thought , a whim , a snap of the fingers . He kept looking at the front entrance to the City Light building , which was a dingy Moderne tower from the 1920s , hoping to spot some American from the newspaper with whom he could share a taxi . The trick was to find out where the American was heading and then to pick out some destination four or five blocks short of there and announce that as one 's own destination . No American had the nerve to ask one to share the cost of the ride under those circumstances . After a bit there emerged an American named Ken Goodrich , the City Light 's director of marketing , whatever in God 's name marketing was . Did he dare once more ? He had already hitched rides with Goodrich twice in the past two months , and the second time Goodrich 's delight over the opportunity to converse with an Englishman on the ride uptown had been considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare . So he girded his loins for the eight-block walk to City Hall , where he could catch the Lexington Avenue subway.  | This old part of lower Manhattan emptied out quickly in the evenings , and as Fallow trudged along in the gloaming he felt increasingly sorry for himself . He searched his jacket pocket to see if he had a subway token . He did , and this provoked a depressing recollection . Two nights ago at # Leicester 's he had reached into his pocket to give Tony Moss a quarter for a telephone call  --  he wanted to be big about the quarter , because he was beginning to get a reputation as a cadger even among his fellow countrymen  --  and he produced a handful of change , and right there , among the dimes , quarters , nickels , and pence , were two subway tokens . He felt as if the entire table was staring at them . Certainly Tony Moss , saw them . Fallow had no physical fear of riding the New York subways . He fancied himself a rugged fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befallen him in the Underground . No , what he feared  --  and it amounted to a true fear  --  was the squalor . Heading down the stairs of the ity Hall subway station with all these dark shabby people was like ' cending , voluntarily , into a dungeon , a very dirty and noisy dungeon . rimy concrete and black bars were everywhere , cage after cage , level pon level , a delirium seen through black bars in every direction . Every time a train entered or left the station there was an agonized squeal of metal , as if some huge steel skeleton were being pried apart by a lever of incomprehensible power . Why was it that in this gross fat country , with Its obscene heaps of wealth and its even more obscene obsession with creature comforts , they were unable to create an Underground as quiet , Orderly , presentable , and  --  well  --  decent as London 's ? Because they were childish . So long as it was underground , out of sight , it did n't matter *hat it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , if a space on a narrow plastic nch could be called a seat . Before him were spread the usual grim riot graffiti , the usual dark shabby people with their gray and brown thes and their sneakers  --  except for a pair just across from him , a man d a boy . The man , who was probably in his forties , was short and ump . He was wearing a tasteful and expensive-looking gray chalkripe suit , a crisp white shirt , and , for an American , a discreet necktie. e also wore a pair of trim , well-made , well-shined black shoes . Amerin men usually destroyed otherwise presentable ensembles by wearing Iky , big-soled , badly kept shoes . ( They seldon saw their own feet , and being childish , scarcely bothered about what was on them . ) Between feet was an obviously expensive dark leather attache case . He was ping over to talk into the ear of the boy , who appeared to be eight or  | nine years old . The boy wore a navy school blazer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still talking to the boy , the man cast his eyes here and there and gestured with his right hand . Fallow figured that here was a man who worked on Wall Street who had had his son down to his office for a visit and was now giving him a ride on the subway and was pointing out the arcana of this rolling dungeon . Absentmindedly he watched the two of them , as the train picked up speed and settled into the rocking lurching roaring momentum of the trip uptown . Fallow could see his own father . A poor little weed , a sad little fellow , was all he had turned out to be , a poor little weed who had had a son named Peter , a poor little failure who sat there amid his bohemian props in a tumbledown house in Canterbury . . . And what am I. thought Fallow , sitting in this rolling dungeon in this insane city in this lunatic country ? Longing for a drink , longing for a drink . . . Another swell of despair rolled over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could see them shining even in this miserable light . He had slid . . . below bohemian . . . The dread word popped into his head : seedy . The subway stop at Lexington Avenue and Seventy-seventh Street was dangerously close to Leicester 's . But that was no problem . Peter Fallow was no longer going to play that game . As he reached the top of the stairs and stepped onto the sidewalk in the twilight , he summoned the scene up into his mind , merely for the purpose of proving to himself his resolve and rejecting it . The old wood , the frosted-glass lamps , the lights from the well behind the bar and the way it lit up the rows of bottles , the pubby crush of people , the roaring hearth of their voices  --  their voices ? English voices . . . Perhaps if he just had an orange juice and ginger ale and fifteen minutes of English voices . . . No ! He would be firm . Now he was in front of Leicester 's , which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Side bistro or trattoria . Between the old-fashioned mullions of the panes he could see all the cozy faces clustered at the tables by the windows , cozy happy white faces lit up by rosy amber lamps . That did it . He needed solace and an orange juice and ginger ale and English voices . As one enters Leicester 's , from Lexington Avenue , one finds himself in a room full of tables with red-checked cloths , in the bistro fashion . Along one wall runs a big saloon bar with a brass foot rail . Off to one side is a smaller dining room . In this room , under the window that looks out on Lexington Avenue , is a table around which eight or ten people can be crammed , assuming they are convivial . By unspoken custom this has become the English table , a kind of club table where , in the afternoon  | d early evening , the Brits  --  members of the London bon ton now living New York  --  come and go , to have a few . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already roaring as Fallow walked in . " Hello , Peter ! " It was Grillo , the American , standing among the crowd at the bar . He as an amusing fellow , and friendly , but Fallow had had enough of merica for one day . He smiled and sang out " Hello , Benny ! " and aded straight for the side room . Tony Moss was at the Table ; and Caroline Heftshank ; and Alex Brittithers , who owned Leicester 's ; and St. John Thomas , the museum di-for and ( on the QT ) art dealer ; and St. John 's boyfriend , Billy Cortez , Venezuelan who had gone to Oxford and might as well have been glish ; and Rachel Lampwick , one of Lord Lampwick 's two remittance ughters in New York ; and Nick Stopping , the Marxist journalist ? : linist was more like it  --  who lived chiefly on articles flattering the rich House &; Garden , Art &; Antiques , and Connoisseur . Judging by the sses and bottles , the Table had been in session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a fish , unless Alex Britt-Withers , e owner  --  but no , Alex never forgave the tab . Fallow sat down and announced that he was turning over a new leaf d wanted only an orange juice with ginger ale . Tony Moss wanted to ? w if this meant he had stopped drinking or stopped paying . Fallow n't mind that , since it came from Tony , whom he liked , and so he ghed and said that in fact nobody 's money was any good this evening ce their generous host , Alex , was at the Table . And Alex said , " Least all yours , I suspect . " Caroline Heftshank said Alex had hurt Fallow 's lings , and Fallow said that was true and that under the circumstances was forced to change his mind . He told the waiter to bring him a ka Southside . " Everybody laughed , because this was an allusion to er Herzfeld , an American , heir to the Herzfeld glass fortune , who gotten into a furious row with Alex last night because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiters and the bartenders crazy ordering the noxious American drink , the vodka Southside , which was de with mint , and then complaining that the mint was n't fresh . That the Table to telling Herzfeld stories . St. John Thomas , in his flutiest ' e , told how he had been to dinner at Herzfeld 's apartment on Fifth nue , and Herzfeld had insisted on introducing the guests to his staff four , which embarrassed the servants and annoyed the guests . He was he had heard the young South American houseboy say , " Well , then , y do n't we all go have dinner at my place , " which probably would  | have made for a more amusing evening , in St. John 's opinion . " Well , would it or would n't it ? " asked Billy Cortez , with a hint of genuine reproach . " I 'm sure you 've taken him up on it since then . A pimply little Puerto Rican , by the way . " " Not Puerto Rican , " said St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Table settled in for the staple topic , which was the domestic manners of the Americans . The Americans , with their perverted sense of guilt , were forever introducing guests to servants , especially " people like Herzfeld , " said Rachel Lampwick . Then they talked about the wives , the American wives , who exercised tyrannical control over their husbands . Nick Stopping said he had discovered why American businessmen in New York took such long lunch hours . It was the only time they could get away from their wives to have sex . He was going to do a piece called " Sex at Noon " for Vanity Fair . Sure enough , the waiter brought Fallow a vodka Southside , and , amid much gaiety and toasting and complaining to Alex about the condition of the mint , h drank it and ordered another . It was actually very tasty . Alex left th Table to see how things were going in the big room , and Johnny Robert son , the art critic , arrived and told a funny story about an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife by their fi names at the opening of the Tiepolo show last night , and Rach . Lampwick told about the American who was introduced to her father " This is Lord Lampwick " ? and said , " Hiya , Lloyd . " But American un versity professors are all terribly hurt if one does n't remember to ca them Doctor , said St. John , and Caroline Heftshank wanted to kno why Americans insist on putting return addresses on the face of t envelope , and Fallow ordered another vodka Southside , and Tony a Caroline said why did n't they order another bottle of wine . Fallow sa ' he did n't mind the Yanks calling him by his first name , if only th would n't insist on condensing it to Pete . All the Yanks at The City Lig called him Pete , and they called Nigel Stringfellow Nige , and they al wore bogus regimental neckties that leaped out in front of their shirts , that every time he saw one of these screaming neckties it set up a still lus-response bond and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had dinner the other night at the home of Stropp , the inv : ment banker , on Park Avenue , and Stropp 's four-year-old daughter , his second wife , came into the dining room pulling a toy wagon , u which was a fresh human turd  --  yes , a turd ! ? her own , one hoped , a she circled the table three times , and neither Stropp nor his wife did thing but shake their heads and smile . This required no extended co ment , since the Yanks ' treacly indulgence of their children was w  | known , and Fallow ordered another vodka Southside and toasted the absent Asher Herzfeld , and they ordered drinks all around . Now it began to dawn on Fallow that he had ordered twenty dollars ' worth of drinks , which he was not about to pay for . As if bound together by Jung 's collective unconscious , Fallow and St. John and Nick and Tony were aware that the hour of the fish had arrived . But which fish ? = It was Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed ! " With the heartiest possible grin on his face , he began beckoning a tall figure toward the y Table . He was an American , well dressed , quite handsome really , with aristocratic features and a face as fair , pink , lineless , and downy as a t peach . " Ed , I want you to meet Caroline Heftshank . Caroline , this is my go() J friend Ed Fiske. " 5 Howjados all around , as Tony introduced the young American to the Table . Then Tony announced : " Ed is the Prince of Harlem . " " Oh , come on , " said Mr. Ed Fiske . " It 's true ! " said Tony . " Ed is the only person I know who can walk the length , the breadth , the width , the highways , the byways , the high life , the low dives , of Harlem whenever he wants , wherever he wants , any time , day or night , and be absolutely welcome . " " Tony , that 's a terrible exaggeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also smiling in a way that indicated it was n't an outrageous exaggeration . He sat down and was encouraged to order a drink , which he did . " What is going on in Harlem , Ed ? " Blushing some more , Mr. Ed Fiske confessed to having been in Harlem 4 that very afternoon . Mentioning no names , he told of an encounter with an individual from whom it was his delicate mission to insist upon the return of quite a lot of money , three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . He told the story haltingly and a bit incoherently , since he was careful not to stress the factor of color or to explain why so much money was involved  --  but the Brits hung on every word with rapt and beaming faces , as if he were the most brilliant raconteur they had come across in the New World . They chuckled , they laughed , they repeated the tag ends of his sentences , like a Gilbert and Sullivan chorus . Mr. Ed Fiske kept talking , gaining steadily in confidence and fluency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fanciest and choicest Harlem lore . What admiring British faces all around him ! How they beamed ! They did indeed appreciate the art of conversation ! With casual largesse he ordered a round of drinks for the Table , and Fallow had another vodka Southside , and Mr.  | Ed Fiske told about a tall menacing man nicknamed Buck who wore a large gold earring , like a pirate . The Brits had their drinks , and then one by one they slipped away , first Tony , then Caroline , then Rachel , then Johnny Robertson , then Nick 1 11 Stopping . When Fallow said , softly , " Excuse me a moment , " and got up , only St. John Thomas and Billy Cortez were left , and Billy was tugging on St. John 's sleeve , because he now detected more than a little sincerity in the rapt look St. John was beaming toward this beautiful and apparently rich boy with the peach complexion . Outside , on Lexington Avenue , Fallow wondered about the size of the bill that would be handed shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being blissfully high . It was bound to be close to two hundred 11 ' 1 ' 1 dollars . He would no doubt pay it without a murmur , the poor fish . The Yanks . Dear God . Only the problem of dinner remained to be solved . Dinner at Leicester 's , even without wine , was at least forty dollars per person . Fallow headed for the coin telephone on the corner . There was this Bob Bowles , the American magazine editor . . . It should work out . . . The skinny woman he lived with , Mona something , was very nearly unbearable , even when she was n't talking . But everything in life had its price , did n't it ? He entered the booth and dropped a quarter in the slot . With luck he would be back inside of Leicester 's within the hour , eating his favorite dish , the chicken paillard , which tasted especially good with red wine . He liked Vieux Galouches , a French wine that came in a bottle with an eccentric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish detective , was at the wheel , and his partner , . Idberg , the Jewish detective , was in the passenger seat , and Kramer s in the back seat , sitting at just the right angle , it so happened , to see speedometer . They were driving down the Major Deegan Expressway a good Irish sixty-five miles an hour , heading for Harlem . Martin 's being Irish was very much on Kramer 's mind at this moment . had just figured out where he had first seen the man . It was soon after joined the Homicide Bureau . He had been sent out to East 152nd -1 , where a man had been shot to death in the back of an automobile . automobile was a Cadillac Sedan DeVille . One of the rear doors was n , and there was a detective standing by it , a little fellow , no more 150 pounds , with a thin neck , a skinny , slightly lopsided face , and eyes of a Doberman pinscher . Detective Martin . Detective Martin ured toward the open door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kramer looked in , and what he saw was horrible beyond any- , g the phrase " shot to death in the back of an automobile " had even un to suggest to him . The victim was a fat man in a loud , checked et . He was sitting on the back seat with his hands on his legs , just . ve his knees , as if he were about to hitch up his pants to keep them being stretched by his kneecaps . He appeared to be wearing a bright let bib . Two-thirds of his head was gone . The rear window of the ' iliac looked as if someone had thrown a pizza up against it . The red was arterial blood , which had pumped out of the stalk of his head like  | was the fun of introducing people to vintage Bronx mayhem if they did n't become unglued ? After that , Kramer made a point of being as Irish as they come at the crime scenes . Martin 's partner , Goldberg , was twice his size , a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache that drooped slightly at the corners of the mouth , and a fat neck . There were Irishmen named Martin and Jews named Martin . There were Germans named Kramer and Jews named Kramer . But every Goldberg in the history of the world was a Jew , with the possible exception of this one . By now , being Martin 's partner , he had probably turned Irish , too . Martin , in the driver 's seat , turned his head slightly to talk to Kramer in the back seat . " I ca n't believe I 'm actually driving to Harlem to listen to this asshole . If it was a wiretap , that I could believe . How the hell did he get to Weiss ? " " I do n't know , " said Kramer . He said it i wearily , just to show that he was a good knockabout fellow who realized this mission was a jerk-off . I n fact , he was still sailing on the verdict that had come in last night . Herbert 92X had gone down . Shelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Apparently Bacon called Joseph Leonard . You know Leonard ? The black assemblyman ? " Kramer 's radar told him that black was too delicate , too refined , too trendy-liberal a designation for a conversation with Martin and Goldberg , but he did n't want to try out anything else . " Yeah , I know him , " said Martin . " He 's a piece a work , too . " " Well , I 'm only guessing , " said Kramer , " but Weiss has an election coming up in November , and if Leonard wants a favor , Weiss 'll do him a favor . He thinks he needs black support . This Puerto Rican , Santiago , is running against him in the primary . " Goldberg snorted . " I love the word they use , support . Like they think there 's some organization out there . That 's a fucking laugh . In the Bros* they could n't organize a cup a coffee . Bedford-Stuyvesant , the same thing . I 've worked the Bronx , Bedford-Stuyvesant , and Harlem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you bring some asshole in and you tell him , Look , there 's two ways we can do this , the easy way and the hard way , it 's up to you , ' at least they know what you 're talking a fountain . Kramer backed out of the car . " Shit ! " he said . " Did you sec that ? How did they  --  I mean , shit ! it 's all over the car ! " To which Martin had said , " Yeah , musta ruined his whole fucking day . " At first Kramer had taken this as a rebuke for his becoming unglued by the sight . but later he figured Martin would n't have had it any other way . What  | about . In the Bronx or Bed-Stuy , fuhgedaboudit . Bed-Stuy 's the worst . In Bed-Stuy you just might as well start rolling in the dirt from the git-go. fight , Marty ? " " Yeah , " said Martin , without enthusiasm . Goldberg had used no desation at all , other than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a iscussion of cop philosophy in the first place . " So Bacon calls Leonard , and Leonard calls Weiss , " said Martin . " And then what ? " This kid Lamb , his mother works for Bacon , or she used to work for con , " said Kramer . " She claims she has some information about what ppened to her son , but she has a whole buncha parking tickets , and ere 's a scofflaw warrant out for her , and she 's afraid to go to the police . the deal is , Weiss quashes the warrant and works out a schedule *hereby she can pay off the tickets , and she gives us the information , but k has to be in Bacon 's presence . " " And Weiss agrees to this . " " Yep . " " Beautiful . " " Well , you know Weiss , " said Kramer . " All he cares about is , he 's wish and he 's running for re-election in a county that 's 70 percent black and Puerto Rican . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . " " You better take off your watch before you go in there . Fucking guy n ' t lift a finger except to steal . " Martin said , " I was thinking about that , Davey . I ca n't see where 's *ere 's any money in this thing , but you can bet it 's there somewhere . " en to Kramer : " You ever hear a the Open Gates Employment Coali- Sure . " That 's one a Bacon 's operations . You know how they turn up at urants demanding jobs for minorities ? You shoulda been at that king brawl up on Gun Hill Road . There was n't a fucking white face king up there . So I do n't know what kinda minorities they 're talking ut , unless a buncha bongos carrying lengths a pipe , you call that a ority. " ramer wondered whether or not bongos could be interpreted as a ' al epithet . He did n't want to be that Irish . " Well then , what 's in it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Oh yeah , we need some a hands , you can all have jobs , ' they 'd look at him like he had bugs  | on his eyeballs . They just take money to stay away . It 's the same with the Third World Anti-Defamation League . They 're the ones that downtown to Broadway and raise hell . That 's one a Bacon 's operatic too . He 's a sweetheart . " " But the Open Gates Employment Coalition , " said Kramer , " t actually get in fights . " " Pitched fucking battles , " said Goldberg . " If it 's a scam , why would they do that ? They could get killed . " " You have to see ' em , " said Martin . " Those crazy fucks 'll go brawli all day for nothing . So why would n't they do it if somebody pays ' em few dollars ? " " Remember that one that swung on you with the pipe , Marty ? " " Remember him ? I saw him in my fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging off his head , like this . " Martin made a big with his thumb and forefinger and put it under his right ear . Kramer did n't know how much of this to believe . He had once read article in The Village Voice describing Bacon as a " street socialist . " black political activist who had arrived at his own theories about shackles of capitalism and the strategies required to give black pcu their due . Kramer had no interest in left-wing politics , and neither did ' " father . Yet in their house , when he was growing up , the word soda had religious overtones . It was like Zealot and Masada . There was so thing Jewish about it . No matter how wrongheaded a socialist might no matter how cruel and vindictive , he possessed somewhere in his so spark of the light of God , of Yahweh . Maybe Bacon 's operation extortion , and maybe it was n't . Looked at one way , the entire history ; . ? the labor movement was extortion . What was a strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat of violence ? The labor movement a religious aura in Kramer 's house , too . The unions were a Masi uprising against the worst of the goyim . His father was a would-be ca talist , a servant of capitalists in actual fact , who had never belonged to 19 labor union in his life and felt infinitely superior to those who did . one night Senator Barry Goldwater had been on TV promoting a rig 1 , I to-work bill , and his father had started growling and cursing in a w that would have made Joe Hill and the Wobblies look like la iq mediators . Yes , the labor movement was truly religious , like Judas itself . It was one of those things you believed in for all mankind did n't care about for a second in your own life . It was funny abc Iq religion . . . His father wrapped it around himself like a cape This guy Bacon wrapped it around himself . . . Herbert wrapped  | uiid himself . . . Herbert . . . All at once Kramer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's funny about these guys and religion , " he said to the two cops in front seat . " I just got off a case , a guy called Herbert 92X .

But at least would . . . comprehend . . . e remained an animated raconteur all the way to Harlem . of a soul was in Reverend Bacon 's great parlor office when the secreled Kramer , Martin , and Goldberg in . Most conspicuously absent Reverend Bacon himself . His big swivel chair rose up in suspenseful tiness behind the desk . e secretary showed the three of them to armchairs facing the desk , then she left . Kramer looked out the bay window behind the swivel ? at the gloomy tree trunks in the garden . The trunks were mottled in es of swamp yellow and rotting green . Then he looked at the ceiling g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that had proclaimed Millionaire eighty years ago . Martin and berg were doing the same thing . Martin looked at Goldberg and ed his lips upward on one side with the look that says , " This is a k. " door opened , and a tall black man entered the room , looking like ten on dollars . He wore a black suit , tailored in a way that brought out width of his shoulders and the trimness of his waist . The jacket had a utton roll that revealed a gorgeous acre of white shirtfront . The hed collar was immaculate against the man 's dark skin . He wore a necktie with a black crisscross pattern , the sort of necktie that ar Sadat used to wear . Kramer felt rumpled just looking at him . r an instant he debated whether or not he should rise from his chair , ing what Martin and Goldberg would think of any gesture of re . But he could n't think of any way out of it . So he stood up . Martin ? a couple of moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldberg ed suit . They looked at each other , and both of them shrugged lips this time . Since Kramer was up first , the man walked toward and held out his hand and said , " Reginald Bacon .

" m the way Martin looked at Reverend Bacon 's hand with his Doan pinscher eyes , Kramer did n't know whether he was going to  | shake it or chew it . He finally shook it . He shook it for at least a fourth a second , as if he had just picked up a chunk of creosote . Gold followed suit . " Get you gentlemen some coffee ? " " No , thanks , " said Kramer . Martin gave Reverend Bacon a frozen stare and then shook his h from side to side twice , ve-ry slow-ly , successfully conveying the mesa " Not even if I was dying of thirst . " Goldberg , the Jewish Shamr followed suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , they all sat down .

" That is true . She has something to tell you . But you ought to know about her and her son , Henry . Henry is . . . was . . . was . . . Lord , this is a tragedy . Henry is a fine young man . . . a fine young man , fine as you wan na meet . . . see . . . Goes to church , never been in trouble , about to graduate from high school , getting ready to go to college . . . a fine young man . And he already graduated from something tougher than Harvard University . He grew up in the projects , and he made it . He survived . He came out of it a fine young man . Henry lamb is . . . was ! . . . the hope ! . . . see . . . the hope . And now somebody just come along and " ? Whop ! He slapped his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even stop . " Because Martin and Goldberg were there , Kramer felt the need to quench the histrionics . " That may well be , Reverend Bacon , " he said , " but so far we do n't ave any evidence of a hit-and-run . " Reverend Bacon gave him his level gaze and then , for the first time , smiled . " You 're going to have all the evidence you need . You 're going to mee Henry Lamb 's mother . I know her very well . . . see . . . and you can believe what she says . She 's a member of my church . She 's a hardworking woman , a good woman . . . see . . . a good woman . She 's got good job , down at the Municipal Building , in the Marriage Bureau . Do n't take a nickel of welfare . A good woman with a good son . " Then he pressed a button on his desk and leaned forward and said , " Miss Hadley , show Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , Henry 's father , was killed six years ago , shot to death , coming home one night , outside the project . Tried to resist a robber . " Reverend Bacon looked at each of the three of them , nodding the whole time . With this , Martin stood up and stared out the bay window . He stared intently Kramer thought he must have spotted a burglary in progress , t the very least . Reverend Bacon looked at him , puzzled . " What kind of trees are they ? " Martin asked . " Which ones , Marty ? " asked Goldberg , and he stood up , too . " Right there , " said Martin , pointing . Reverend Bacon swiveled around in his chair and looked out the winow himself . " Those are sycamore trees , " he said . " Sycamores , " said Martin , in the contemplative tone of a young naturalist in an arboriculture program . " Look at those trunks . They must go pp fifty feet . " " Trying to reach the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . "  | Behind Kramer a pair of huge oak doors opened , and the secretary , Miss Hadley , ushered in a trim black woman , no more than forty , perhaps younger . She wore a businesslike blue skirt and jacket and a white blouse . Her black hair was done in soft waves . She had a thin , almost delicate face and large eyes and the self-possessed look of a teacher or someone else used to meeting the public . Reverend Bacon stood up and walked around the desk to meet her . Kramer stood up also  --  and understood Martin 's and the Jewish Shamrock 's sudden interest in the arboreal species . They did n't want to get trapped into having to stand when the woman came into the room . It had been bad enough having to get up for a hustler like Bacon . Doing it again for some woman from the projects who was part of his setup was taking this thing too far . This way they were already on their feet , studying the sycamore trees , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Reverend Bacon , " this is Mrs. Annie Lamb . This is the gentleman from the District Attorney 's Office in the Bronx , Mr. Kramer . And , uh ? " " Detective Martin , and Detective Goldberg , " said Kramer . " They 're in charge of the investigation of your son 's case . " Mrs. Lamb did n't step forward to shake hands and she did n't smile . She nodded ever so slightly . She seemed to be withholding judgment on the three of them . Very much the shepherd , Reverend Bacon pulled up an armchair for her . Instead of returning to his big swivel chair , he sat on the edge of the desk with an athletic casualness . Reverend Bacon said to Mrs. Lamb , " I was talking to Mr. Kramer here , and the parking tickets , they 're taken care of . " He looked at Kramer . " Well , the warrant 's been quashed , " said Kramer . " There 's no more warrant . Now there 's just the tickets , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tickets , anyway . " Reverend Bacon looked at Mrs. Lamb and smiled and nodded his head a few times , as if to say , " Reverend Bacon delivers . " She just looked at him and pursed her lips . " Well , Mrs. Lamb , " said Kramer , " Reverend Bacon tells us you have some information for us about what happened to your son . " Mrs. Lamb looked at Reverend Bacon . He nodded yes and said , " Go ahead . Tell Mr. Kramer what you told me . " She said , " My son was hit by a car , and the car did n't stop . It was a hit-and-run . But he got the license number , or he got part of it . "  | Her voice was businesslike . " Wait a minute , Mrs. Lamb , " said Kramer . " If you do n't mind , start at the beginning . When did you first learn about this ? When did you first know your son had been injured ? " " When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  uh  --  I do n't know what you call it . " " A cast ? " " No , it was n't a cast . It was more like a splint , only it looked like a big canvas glove . " " Well , anyway , he came home from the hospital with this wrist injury . When was that ? " " That was . . . three nights ago . " " What did he say had happened ? " " He did n't say much . He was in a lot of pain , and he wanted to go to bed . He said something about a car , but I thought he was riding in a car and they had an accident . Like I say , he did n't want to talk . I think they gave him something at the hospital , for the pain . He just wanted to go to bed . So I told him to go to bed . " " Did he say who he was with when it happened ? " " No . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then he was n't in a car . " " No , he was walking . " " All right , go ahead . What happened next ? " " The next morning he felt real bad . He tried to lift his head , and he pearly passed out . He felt so bad I did n't go to work . I called in  --  I stayed ome . That was when he told me a car hit him . " " How did he say it happened ? " " He was walking across Bruckner Boulevard , and this car hit him , and fell on his wrist , and he must have hit his head , too , because he has a terrible concussion . " At this point her composure broke . She closed her es , and they were full of tears when she opened them . Kramer waited a moment . " Where on Bruckner Boulevard was this ? " " 1 do n't know . When he tried to talk , it was too painful for him . He 'd his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But he was by himself , you said . What was he doing on Bruckner ulevard ? " " I do n't know . There 's a takeout place up there , at 161st Street , the xas Fried Chicken , and Henry , he likes these things they have there , chicken nuggets , and so maybe he was going there , but I do n't ow. "  | " Where did the car hit him ? Where on his body ? " " I do n't know that , either . The hospital , maybe they can tell you that . " Reverend Bacon broke in : " The hospital , they fell down on the job . They did n't X-ray that young man 's head . They did n't give him the CAT scan or the nuclear magnetic resonance or any of those other things . That young man comes in with a very serious injury to his head , and they treat his wrist and send him home . " " Well , " said Kramer , " apparently they did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Martin . " ' S'at right ? " " The emergency-room report do n't mention an automobile , " said Martin . " The boy had a serious injury to his head ! " said Reverend Bacon . " He probably did n't know half of what he was saying . They 're supposed to figure out those things . " " Well , let 's do n't get sidetracked on that , " said Kramer . " He got part of the license plate , " said Mrs. Lamb . " What 'd he tell you ? " " He said it started with R. That was the first letter . The second letter was E or F or P or B or some letter like that . That was what it looked like . " " What state ? New York ? " " What state ? I do n't know . I guess New York . He did n't say it was 1,1 something else . And he told me the make . " What was it ? " " A Mercedes . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . He did n't say . " " Four-door ? Two-door ? " " I do n't know . " " Did he say what the driver looked like ? " " He said there was a man and a woman in the car . " " A man was driving ? " " I guess so . I do n't know . " " Any description of the man or the woman ? " " They were white . " dlf " He said they were white ? Anything else ? " " No , he just said they were white . " " That 's all ? He did n't say anything else about them or about the car ? " " No . He could hardly talk . " " How did he get to the hospital ? "  | " I do n't know . He did n't tell me . " Kramer asked Martin , " Did they say at the hospital ? " " He was a walk-in . " " He couldn'ta walked from Bruckner Boulevard to Lincoln Hospital ' th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked all the way there . It just means he alked in the emergency room . He was n't carried in . The EMS did n't . ring him . He did n't come in an ambulance . " Kramer 's mind was already jumping ahead to trial preparation . All he uld see were dead ends . He paused and then shook his head and said , no one in particular : " That do n't give us very much . " " Whaddaya mean ? " said Bacon . For the first time there was a sharp ? ne in his voice . " You got the first letter on the license plate , and you got line on the second letter , and you got the make of the car  --  how many ercedeses with a license plate beginning with RE , RF , RB , or RP you ' nk you gon na find ? " " There 's no telling , " said Kramer . " Detective Martin and Detective oldberg will run that down . But what we need is a witness . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No case ? " said Reverend Bacon . " You got a case and a half seems to . You got a young man , an outstanding young man , at death 's door . ? u got a car and a license plate . How much case you need ? " " Look , " said Kramer , hoping that an ultra-patient , slightly condending tone would take care of the implied rebuke . " Let me explain ? mething to you . Let 's assume we identify the car tomorrow . Okay ? is assume the car is registered in the state of New York , and there 's ly one Mercedes with a license number that begins with R. Now we 've t a car . But we got no driver . " " Yeah , but you can ? " " Just because somebody owns a car does n't mean " ? as soon as it pped out , Kramer hoped the does n't would blow by undetected ? " he s driving it at a particular time . " " But you can question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would . But unless he says , Sure , I was involved such-and-such a hit-and-run accident , ' we 're back where we started . " Reverend Bacon shook his head . " I do n't see that . " " The problem is , we do n't have a witness . We not only do n't have ybody to tell us where this thing happened , we do n't even have anyy who can tell us he was hit by any car at all . " You got Henry Lamb himself ! "  | Kramer raised his hands from his lap and shrugged gently , so as not to overemphasize the fact that Mrs. Lamb 's son would probably never be able to bear witness to anything again . " You got what he told his mother . He told her himself . " " It gives us a lead , but it 's hearsay . " " It 's what he told his mother . " " You may accept it as the truth , and I may accept it as the truth , but it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't make sense to me . " " Well , that 's the law . But in all candor I ought to bring out something else . Apparently when he came into the emergency room three nights ago , he did n't say anything about being hit by a car . That do n't help matters any . " Do n't . He got it right that time . " He had a concussion . . . and a broken wrist . . . Probably a lot of things he did n't say . " " Well , was he thinking any more clearly the next morning ? You could make that argument , too . " " Who 's making that argument ? " said Reverend Bacon . " You 're making that argument ? " " I 'm not making any argument . I 'm just trying to show you that without a witness there 's a lot of problems . " " Well , you can find the car , ca n't you ? You can interrogate the owner . You can check that car for evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Kramer . " As I told you , they 're gon na run that down . " He nodded toward Martin and Goldberg . " They 'll try to find witnesses , too . But I do n't think a car would yield much evidence . If a car hit him , it must 've grazed him . He has some bruises , but he do n't have the kind of bodily injuries you 'd have from being really hit by a car . " " Say if a car hit him ? " " This case is fulla ifs , Reverend Bacon . If we find a car and an owner , and if the owner says , Yeah , I hit this young man the other night , and I did n't stop , and I did n't report it , ' then we got a case . Otherwise , we got a lot of problems . " " Unh-hunh , " said Reverend Bacon . " So it might be you ca n't spend a whole lot a time on this case , being as it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This case will get as much attention as any other case . " " You say be candid . Well , I 'm going to be candid . Henry Lamb is not a prominent citizen , and he 's not the son of a prominent citizen , but he 's a fine young man all the same . . . see . . . He 's about to graduate from  | high school . He did n't drop out . He was  --  he 's thinking about going to college . Never been in trouble . But he 's from the Edgar Allan Poe projlets . The Edgar Allan Poe projects . He 's a young black man from the projects . Now , let 's turn this thing around for a minute . Suppose Henry lamb was a young white man and he lived on Park Avenue , and he was about to go to Yale , and he was struck down on Park Avenue by a black man and a black woman in a . . . a . . . Pontiac Firebird instead of a Mercedes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother what Henry Lamb told his mother . You mean to tell me you would n't have a case ? Instead of talking about problems , you 'd be turning that information bride out and counting the stitches . " Martin came rumbling to life . " We 'd do the same thing we 're doing right now . We been trying to find Mrs. Lamb here for two days . When did we find out about a license number ? You heard it . I 've worked Park venue and I 've worked Bruckner Boulevard . It do n't make any differe . Martin 's voice was so calm and definite , and his stare was so implaca , so mule-like , so stone Irish , it seemed to jolt Reverend Bacon for a ment . He tried to outstare the little Irishman , without success . Then smiled slightly and said , " You can tell me that , because I 'm a minister , I want to believe that justice is blind . . . see . . . I want to believe But you best not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx ing to tell people that . You best not be informing them about these . sings , because they already know the truth . They discover it the hard Y. " I 'm on the streets of the Bronx every day , " said Martin , " and I 'll tell ybody who wants to know . " " Unh-hunh , " said Reverend Bacon . " We have an organization , All pie 's Solidarity . We survey the communities , and the people come to and I can tell you that the people are not getting your message . They getting another message . " " I been in one a your surveys , " said Martin . " You been in what ? " ne a your surveys . Up on Gun Hill Road . " " Yeah , well , I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " It was on the streets of the Bronx , " said Martin . " Anyway , " said Kramer , looking at Mrs. Lamb , " thank you for your ormation . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' II check out that license number . In the meantime , if you hear about  | anyone who was with your son the other night , or saw anything , you let us know , okay ? " " Unh-hunh , " she said , striking the same dubious note as she had at the outset . " Thank you . " Martin was still staring at Reverend Bacon with his Doberman pinscher eyes . So Kramer turned to Goldberg and said , " You have a card you can give Mrs. Lamb , with a telephone number ? " Goldberg fished around in an inside pocket and handed her a card . She took it without looking at it . Reverend Bacon stood up . " You do n't have to give me your card , " he said to Goldberg . " I know you . . . see . . . I 'm going to call you . I 'm going to be on your case . I want to see something done . All People ' Solidarity wants to see something done . And something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So one thing you can count on : you will hear from me . " Anytime , " said Martin . " Anytime you like . " His lips were parted ever so slightly , with the suggestion of a smile the corners . It reminded Kramer of the expression , the Smirking Fan : that boys wore at the beginning of a playground brawl . Kramer started walking out , saying his goodbyes over his shoulder he went , hoping that would coax Battling Martin and the Jewish Sham rock out of the room . On the drive back up to the fortress , Martin said , " Christ , now I kno why they send you guys to law school , Kramer . So you can learn how t. keep a straight face . " He said it good-naturedly , however . " Well , hell , Marty , " said Kramer , figuring that , having been a fellow soldier with him in the bullshit skirmish at Reverend Bacon 's , he could go on a nickname basis with the dauntless little Irish Donkey , " the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license number will turn up something . " " You wan na bet on it ? " " It 's a possibility . " " My ass , it 's a possibility . You get hit by a fucking car , and you go t the hospital and you do n't happen to mention that to them ? And th you go home and you do n't happen to mention it to your mother ? A the next morning you 're not feeling so hot , so you say , ' Oh , by the way , got hit by a car ' ? Gedoudahere . That poor bastard took a beating , but was n't from anything he wanted to tell anybody about . " " Oh , I do n't doubt that . See if there 's a sheet on him , will you ? " " You know , " said Goldberg , " I feel sorry for those people . They  | there saying the kid do n't have a record , like that 's a real fucking accomplishment . And in the projects , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's something special . I feel sorry for her . " And a little of the Jew oozes out of the Jewish Shamrock , thought Kramer . But then Martin took up the refrain . " A woman like that , she should n't even be living in the project , f'r Chrissake . She was all right . She was straight . Now I remember that case when her husband got killed . The guy was a working stiff who had heart . Stood up to some lowlife , and the fucking guy shot him right in the mouth . She works , do n't . take welfare , sends the kid to church , keeps him in school  --  she 's all right . No telling what the kid got himself involved in , but she 's all right . Haifa these people , you know , something happens , and you talk to them , and they spend so much time blaming the fucking world for what happened , you ca n't halfway find out what the fuck happened in the first place . But this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fucking project , but you know " ? he looked at Kramer when he said this ? " there 's a lotta decent people in the projects , people that show up for work . " Goldberg nodded sagely and said , " You 'd never know it now , but that 's what the fucking places were built for , working people . That was the whole idea , low-cost housing for working people . And now you find somebody in'eh who goes to work and tries to do the right thing , it I breaks your fucking heart . " Then it dawned on Kramer . The cops were n't all that much different from the assistant D.A . ' s . It was the muck factor . The cops got tired of packing blacks and Latins off to jail all day , too . It was even worse for them , because they had to dive deeper into the muck to do it . The only thing that made it constructive was the idea that they were doing it for somebody  --  for the decent people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were attuned to all the good people with colored skin . who rose to the top . . . during all this relentless stirring of the muck . . . You could n't exactly call it enlightenment , thought Kramer , but it was j a fucking start .  | / This time the explosion of the telephone threw his heart into tachycardia , and each contraction forced the blood through his head with such pressure  --  a stroke ! ? he was going to have a stroke ! ? lying here alone in his high-rise American hovel ! ? a stroke ! The panic roused the beast . The beast came straight to the surface and showed its snout . Fallow opened one eye and saw the telephone lying in a brown Streptolon nest . He was dizzy , and he had n't even lifted his head . Great curds of eye trash swam in front of his face . The pounding blood was breaking up the mercury yolk into curds , and the curds were coming out of his eye . The telephone exploded again . He closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyelid . That pedophile business And last night had started off as such an ordinary evening ! Having less than forty dollars to get him through the next three days , he had done the usual . He had called up a Yank . He had called up Gil Archer , the literary agent , who was married to a woman whose name Fallow could never remember . He had suggested that they meet for dinner at Leicester 's , leaving the impression he would be bringing a girl along himself . Archer arrived with his wife , whereas he arrived alone . Naturally , under the circumstances , Archer , ever the bland polite Yank , picked up the bill . Such a quiet evening ; such an early evening ; such a routine evening for an Englishman in New York , a dull dinner paid for by a Yank ; he really was thinking about getting up and going home . And then Caroline Heftshank and this artist friend of hers , an Italian , Filippo  | Chirazzi , came in , and they stopped by the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like something to drink , and he said why did n't they get another bottle of wine , and so Archer ordered another bottle of wine , and they drank that , and then they drank another one and another one , and now Leicester 's was packed and roaring with all the usual faces , and Alex Britt-Withers sent over one of his waiters to offer a round of drinks on the house , which made Archer feel socially uccessful , recognized-by-the-owner sort of thing  --  the Yanks were very keen on that  --  and Caroline Heftshank kept hugging her handsome young Italian , Chirazzi , who was posing with his pretty profile up in the air , as if one were to feel privileged just to be breathing the same air as himself . St. John came over from another table to admire young Signor Chirazzi , much to Billy Cortez 's displeasure , and Signor Chirazzi told St. John it was necessary for a painter to paint with " the eyes of a child , " and St. John said that he himself tried to view the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cortez said , " He said child , St. John , not pedophile . " Signor Chirazzi posed some more , with his long neck and Valentino nose rising up from out of a ridiculous electric-blue Punk shirt with three-quarter-inch collar and a pink glitter necktie , and so Fallow said was more Post-modern for a painter to have the eyes of a pedophile an the eyes of a child , and what did Signor Chirazzi think ? Caroline , who was quite drunk , told him not to be stupid , said it quite sharply , and Fallow reared back , meaning only to strike a pose mocking the young painter , but lost his balance and fell on the floor . Much laughter . When e got up , he was dizzy , and he held on to Caroline , just to steady imself , but young Signor Chirazzi took offense , from the depths of his talian manly honor , and tried to shove Fallow , and both Fallow and . roline now went down , and Chirazzi tried to jump on Fallow , and St. ? hn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian , and Billy rtez was screaming , and Fallow struggled up , carrying an enormous eight , and Britt-Withers was over him , yelling , " For God 's sake ! " and ? en a whole bunch of people were on top of him , and they all went : shing out the front door onto the sidewalk on Lexington Avenue The telephone exploded again , and Fallow was terrified at what he ight hear if he picked up the receiver . He could remember nothing from e time they all went crashing out onto the sidewalk until this moment . e swung his feet out of the bed , and they were all still roaring and ailing inside his skull , and his whole body felt sore . He crawled across carpet to the exploding telephone and lay down beside it . The carpet t dry , metallic , dusty , filthy against his cheek .  | " Hello ? " " Aaaayyy , Pete ! How wahya ! " It was a cheery voice , a Yank voice , a New York voice , a particularly crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice even more jarring than the Pete . Well , at least it was n't The City Light . Nobody at The City Light would be calling him with such a cheery voice . " Who is it ? " said Fallow . His own voice was an animal in a hole . " Jeezus , Pete , you sound terrific . Any pulse ? Hey . This is Al Vogel . " The news made him close his eyes again . Vogel was one of those typical Yank celebrities who , to an Englishman reading about them in Lon ? don , seemed so colorful , irrepressible , and morally admirable . In person , in New York , they always turned out the same way . They were Yanks ; which is to say , crude bores . Vogel was well known in England as an American lawyer whose specialty was unpopular political causes . He defended radicals and pacifists , much the way Charles Garry , William Kunstler , and Mark Lane had . Unpopular , of course , merely meant un ? popular with ordinary people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intellectuals in the 1960s and 1970s , especially in Europe , where anyone defended by Albert Vogel grew wings , a halo , a toga , and a torch . Few of these latter-day saints had any money , however , and Fallow often wondered how Vogel made a living , especially since the 1980s had not been kind to him . In the 1980s not even the press and intellectuals had any patience for the sort of irascible , seething , foul . humored , misery-loving , popped-vein clientele he specialized in . Lately Fallow had been running into the great defender at the most extraordi ? nary parties . Vogel would go to the opening of a parking lot ( and Fallow would say hello to him there ) . " Oh , hi-i-i-i , " said Fallow in what ended up as a moan . " I called your office first , Pete , and they said they had n't seen you . " Not good , thought Fallow . He wondered when , if , why , where he had given Vogel his home telephone number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ummmmmmmm . " Fallow had his eyes closed . He had no sense of up or down . " It 's all right . I 'm working at home today . " " I 've got something I want to talk to you about , Pete . I think there 's hell of a story in it . " " Ummmm . " " Yeah , only I 'd just as soon not go into it over the telephone . I tell you what . Why n't you come have lunch with me . I 'll meet you at the Re ? gent 's Park at one o'clock . "  | " Ummmm . I do n't know , Al . The Regent 's Park . Where is that ? " " On Central Park South , near the New York Athletic Club . " " Ummmmm . " Fallow was torn between two profound instincts . On the one hand , the o ught of getting off the floor , of shifting the mercury yolk for a second e , for no other reason than to listen to an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , a free meal at a restaurant . e pterodactyl and the brontosaurus were locked in mortal combat on e cliff over the Lost Continent . The free meal won , as it had so often in the past . " All right , Al , I 'll see you at one o'clock . Where is this place again ? " " On Central Park South , Pete , right near the New York A.C. It 's a e place . You can look at the park . You can look at a statue of Jose arti on a horse . " Fallow said goodbye and struggled to his feet , and the yolk was yawing is way and that way , and he stubbed his toe on the metal frame of the s . The pain was terrific , but it focused his central nervous system . He k a shower in the dark . The plastic shower curtain was suffocating . en he closed his eyes he had the feeling he was keeling over . From e to time he had to hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of New York restaurant favored by cried men having affairs with young women . It was grand , glossy , and lemn , with a great deal of marble inside and out , a colossal stiff neck hose hauteur appealed mainly to people staying at the nearby Ritz : rlton , Park Lane , St. Moritz , and Plaza Hotels . In the history of New ork no conversation had ever begun with : " I was having lunch at the gent 's Park the other day and . . . " True to his word , Albert Vogel had secured a table beside the great ndow . This was not a hard ticket at the Regent 's Park . Nevertheless , ere it was , the park , in its springtime glory . And there was the statue of ? : e Marti , which Vogel had also promised . Marti 's horse was rearing ? , and the great Cuban revolutionary was leaning perilously to the right his saddle . Fallow averted his eyes . An unsteady park statue was too uch to contend with . Vogel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips move ithout hearing a word . The blood drained from Fallow 's face , and then ' s chest and arms . His hide turned cold . Then a million little scalding t minnows tried to escape from his arteries and reach the surface . rspiration broke out on his forehead . He wondered if he was dying .  | This was the way heart attacks began . He had read that . He wondered if Vogel knew about coronary resuscitation . Vogel looked like someone 's grandmother . His hair was white , not a gray-white , but a silky pure white . He was short and pudgy . In his palmy days he had been pudgy , too , but he had looked " scrappy , " as the Yanks liked to say . Now his skin was pinkish and delicate . His hands were tiny and had ropy old veins leading up to the knuckles . A cheery old woman . " Pete , " said Vogel , " what 'll you have to drink ? " " Not a thing , " said Fallow , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some water . " " I want a margarita on the rocks , " said Vogel . " Sure you wo n't change your mind , Pete ? " Fallow shook his head . That was a mistake . A poisonous hammering began inside his skull . " Just one to turn the motor over ? " " No , no . " Vogel put his elbows on the table and leaned forward and began scan ? fling the room , and then his eyes fastened on a table slightly behind hirn . At the table were a man in a gray business suit and a girl in her late teens with long , straight , very showy blond hair . " You see that girl ? " said Vogel . " I could swear that girl was on this committee , whatever they call it , at the University of Michigan . " " What committee ? " " This student group . They run the lecture program . I gave a lecture al the University of Michigan two nights ago . " So what ? thought Fallow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not her . But , Christ , it sure looks like her . These goddamned girls at these colleges  --  you wan na know why people go out on the lea ture circuit in this country ? " No , thought Fallow . " Okay , for the money . But not counting that . You wan na know why . The Yanks constantly repeated introductory questions . " These goddamned girls . " Vogel shook his head and stared off di tractedly for a moment , as if stunned by the very thought . " I swear t God , Pete , you have to hold yourself back . Otherwise , you 'd feel . fucking guilty . These girls  --  today  --  well , when I was growing up , the big deal was that when you went to college , you could drink when you tell like it . Okay ? These girls , they go to college so they can get laid when they feel like it . And who do they want ? This is the part that 's really pathetic . Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You  | na know who ? They want . . . Authority . . . Power . . . Fame . Prestige . . . They wan na get laid by the teachers ! The teachers go y at these places now . You know , when the Movement was going ng , one of the things we tried to do on the campuses was to break n that wall of formality between the faculty and the students , because was nothing but an instrument of control . But now , Jesus Christ , I ? nder . I guess they all want to get laid by their fathers , if you believe ud , which I do n't . You know , this is one thing the women 's movement made no headway with . When a woman reaches forty , her problems just as big now as they ever were  --  and a guy like me has never had it good . I 'm not so old , but , f'r Chrissake , I 've got gray hair ? " White , thought Fallow , like an old woman's. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little touch of brity and they fall over . They just fall over . I 'm not bragging , because so pathetic . And these goddamned girls , each one is more of a knockthan the last one . I 'd like to give them a lecture on that subject , but probably would n't know what I was talking about . They have no e of reference , about anything . The lecture I gave the night before was on student commitment in the 1980s . " I was dying to know , " said Fallow in the back of his throat , without ing his lips . Pardon ? " e Yanks said pardon ? instead of what ? Nothing . " I told them what it was like on the campuses fifteen years ago . " His clouded over . " But I do n't know . . . fifteen years ago , fifty years a hundred years ago . . . they have no frame of reference . It 's all so ote to them . Ten years ago . . . five years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ca n't imagine that . " flow stopped listening . There was no way Vogel could be deflected his course . He was irony-proof . Fallow glanced at the girl with the yellow hair . Thrashing through the restaurant . Caroline Heftshank the frightened look on her face . Had he done something just before all went crashing out the door ? Whatever  --  she deserved it  --  but t was it ? Vogel 's lips were moving . He was going through his entire ure . Fallow 's eyelids dropped shut . The beast broke the surface and . hed about and eyed him . He eyed him straight down his filthy snout. the beast had him . He could n't move . . . . Managua ? " asked Vogel . What ? "  | " You ever been there ? " asked Vogel . Fallow shook his head . The yawing motion made him nauseous . " You ought a go . Every journalist ought a go . It 's about the size of . . oh , I do n't know , East Hampton . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? It would be easy enough to set it up for you . " Fallow did n't want to shake his head again . " Is that the story you wanted to tell me about ? " Vogel paused a moment , as if weighing the remark for sarcastic content . " No , " he said , " but it 's not a bad idea . About one-fiftieth of everything that ought a be said about Nicaragua gets printed in this country . No , what I was talking about is something that happened in the Bronx four days ago . It might as well be Nicaragua , if you happen to live there . Anyway , you know who Reverend Bacon is , do n't you ? " " Yes . I think so . " " He 's a  --  well , he 's a  --  you 've read about him or seen him on TV , have n't you ? " " Yes . " Vogel laughed . " You wan na know where I first met him ? In this gigantic duplex apartment on Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interested in the Geronimo Brotherhood . She gave a fund-raising party there . This must 've been the late sixties , early seventies . There was this guy Flying Deer . He gave the soul talk , we used t0 call it . There was always the soul talk and the money talk . Anyway , h. gave the soul talk , the spiritual talk . She did n't know the sonofabitch w. loaded . She just thought it was Indian talk , the crazy way he sounded . Fifteen minutes later he threw up all over this eighty-thousand-dolla Duncan Phyfe piano Peggy had , all over the keys and the strings and th hammers and everything . You know those little felt hammers ? Oh , it w. outrageous . She never got over it . That jerk blew a good deal that night . And you wan na know who really gave him hell ? Reverend Bacon . Yeah . He was getting ready to ask Peggy to support some of the things he had going , and when this Flying Deer threw his cookies all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy Fryskamp . He started calling him Flying Beer . Flying Deer ? Flying Beer , if I know anything about it ! ' Jesus , it was funny . But he was n't trying to be funny . Bacon never tries to be funny . Anyway , he has this woman who works for him sometimes , Annie Lamb , from the Bronx . Annie Lamb lives in the Edgar Allan Poe project with this one son she has , Henry . " " She 's black ? " asked Fallow .  | " Yeah , she 's black . Practically everybody in the Poe projects is black or Puerto Rican . By law , incidentally , all these projects are supposed to be integrated . " Vogel shrugged his eyebrows . " Anyway , this Annie Lamb is an unusual woman . " Vogel recounted the history of Annie Lamb and her family , culminating in the hit-and-run Mercedes-Benz that had left her promising son , Henry , at death 's door . 4 Unfortunate , thought Fallow , but where 's the story ? As if anticipating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sides to this thing , and both of them have to do with what happens to a good kid like this if he has the misfortune of being black and growing up in the Bronx . I mean , here 's a kid who did everything right . You talk about Henry Lamb , you 're talking about the one percent who do exactly what the system tells them they 're supposed to do . Okay ? So what happens ? First , the hospital treats the kid for . . . a broken wrist ! If this had been a middle-class white kid , they'd 've gone over him with the X-ray , the CAT scan , the nuclear magnetic resonance , everything there is . Second , the police and the D.A . wo n't move on the case . This is what really infuriates the kid 's mother . Here 's a hit-and-run , they 've got part of the license number and the make of the car , and they 're doing zip about it . " " Why ? " " Well , basically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets hit by a car , as far as they 're concerned . They ca n't be bothered . But what they 're saying is , there were no witnesses , except for the victim himself , and he 's in a terminal coma , and so they would n't have a case even if they found the car and the driver . Now , suppose this were your son . He 's provided the information , but they 're not going to use it because technically it 's hearsay . " The whole thing made Fallow 's head hurt . He could n't imaging having a son , and certainly not in some council flats in the Bronx section of New York City in America . " It 's an unfortunate situation , " said Fallow , " but I 'm not altogether sure there 's a story in it . " " Well , there 's gon na be a story in it very shortly for somebody , Pete , " said Vogel . " The community is up in arms . They 're about to explode . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What exactly are they exploding over ? " " They 're tired of being treated as if human life in the South Bronx means nothing ! And I 'm telling you , when Bacon gets hold of something , things happen . He 's not Martin Luther King or Bishop Tutu . Okay ? He 's not gon na win any Nobel Prize . He 's got his own way of doing things ,  | and sometimes it might not stand close scrutiny . But that 's one reason he 's effective . He 's what Hobsbawm called a primitive revolutionary . Hobsbawm was a Brit , right ? " " He still is . " " I thought he was . He had this theory about primitive revolutionaries . There are certain natural leaders of the underclasses , and the power structure interprets what they do as crime  --  they may even sincerely interpret it that way  --  but what that person is , is a revolutionary . And that 's what Bacon is . I admire him . And I feel sorry for these people . Anyway , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite aside from the philosophical considerations . " Fallow closed his eyes . He saw the snout of the beast , lit up by soft bistro lights . Then the icy chill . He opened his eyes . Vogel was staring at him with his cheery old pink nanny 's grin . This ridiculous country . " Look , Pete , the worst you 'll get out of this is a good human-interest story . And if things break right , you 'll be on to something big . I can get you an interview with Annie Lamb . I can get you an interview with Reverend Bacon . I can take you right into the intensive-care unit , where the kid is . I mean , he 's in a coma , but you can see him . " Fallow tried to conceive of transferring the mercury egg and his bilious innards to the Bronx . He could scarcely imagine surviving the trip . From his viewpoint the Bronx was like the Arctic . It was somewhere to the north , and people did n't go there . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the high life . " He attempted a smile . " Supposed to be , Peter , supposed to be . They wo n't fire you if you come in with a hell of a good story from the low life . " The word fire was what did it . He closed his eyes . The snout was not there . Instead , he saw the Dead Mouse 's face . He could see the Mouse looking toward his cubicle in the city room at this moment and finding it empty . Fear suffused his every cell , and he put his napkin to his forehead . " Do you mind if I ask you something , Al ? " " Go ahead . " " What 's your interest in all this ? " " None , if you 're talking about material interest . Reverend Bacon called me and asked my advice , and I told him I 'd try to help him out , that 's all . I like him . I like what he 's trying to do . I like the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side . I told him he should try to get this thing into the newspapers before he has the protest demonstration . That way he 's gon na get more television coverage and everything else . I 'm  | telling you the plain truth now . I thought of you because I figured maybe you could use an opportunity like this . This could be to your advantage and to the advantage of a lot of decent people who never get a fucking break in this city . " Fallow shuddered . Just what had Vogel heard about his situation ? He did n't really want to know . He knew he was being used . At the same time , here was a piece of meat to throw to the Mouse . " Well , maybe you 're right . " " I know I 'm right , Pete . This is gon na be a big story one way or the other . You might as well be the one to break it . " " You can take me to see these people ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing is , you ca n't sit on the story . Bacon is ready to go . " " Ummmm . Let me take down some of these names . " Fallow reached into the side pocket of his jacket . Christ , he had n't even picked up a notebook or a piece of paper before he left . From out of the pocket he brought a notice from Con Edison warning him that his gas and electricity were about to be cut off . He could n't even write on it . It had print on both sides . Vogel watched all this and , without comment , produced a memorandum pad and handed it to him . Then he handed him a silver ballpoint pen . He repeated the names and details . " I tell you what , " said Fallow . " I 'm going to call the city desk straightaway . " He got up and caromed off a chair at the next table , where an old woman in a Chanel-style suit was trying to lift a spoonful of sorrel soup to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat ? " said Vogel . " I 'll order for you . " " Nothing . A bowl of tomato soup . Some chicken paillard . " " Some wine ? " " No . Well . Just a glass . " The coin telephone was in a vestibule across from the hatcheck room , here a pretty girl sat on a high stool reading a book . Her eyes peeked ut from a sinister black ellipse carefully drawn around her eyelids . Falw rang up Frank de Pietro , the city editor of The City Light . De Pietro was one of the few Americans in an important editorial position on the newspaper . They needed someone from New York as city editor . The her Englishmen who worked there , like Fallow himself , were acuainted with a single stretch of Manhattan from the trendy restaurants TriBeCa on the south to the trendy restaurants in Yorkville , near  | Eighty-sixth Street , on the north . The rest of New York might as well have been Damascus . " Yeah ? " The voice of Frank de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fallow at a busy time of the day was imperceptible . " Frank , " said Fallow , " are you familiar with a place called the Edgar Allan Poe projects ? " " Yeah . Are you ? " Fallow did n't know which was more unpleasant , this Yank habit of saying yeah for yes , or the incredulity in the man 's voice . Nevertheless , he plowed on , telling Albert Vogel 's story with embellishments , where needed , and with no mention of Albert Vogel . He left the impression that he had already been in touch with Reverend Bacon and the victim 's mother , and that his imminent appearance in the Bronx was awaited by one and all . De Pietro told him to go ahead and check it out . This he did with no particular enthusiasm , either . And yet Fallow felt his heart fill with a quite unexpected joy . When he returned to the table , Vogel said , " Hey , how 'd it go ? Your soup 's getting cold . " The words barely made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food . A large bowl of tomato soup and a glass of white wine were at Fallow 's place . Vogel was busy working on a hideous-looking joint of veal . " They like it , hunh ? " " Ummmmmm . " Well , they do n't despise it , thought Fallow . His nausea began withdrawing . The yolk grew smaller . A crisp exhilaration , not unlike that of an athlete entering the fray , stole into his nervous system . He felt . . . almost clean . It was the emotion , never commented upon by the poets , enjoyed by those who feel that , for once , they are earning their pay . It was Kramer 's turn to wear the beeper on his waistband for twelve hours . In the Homicide Bureau of the Bronx District Attorney 's Office , somebody , some assistant district attorney , was on call at all times . The purpose was to have someone to go to crime scenes immediately , to interview witnesses before they vanished or lost the urge to talk about the mayhem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to get stuck with every piece a shit in the Bronx that involved a homicide , and it was a classic Bronx piece a shit that had brought Kramer here to this precinct house . A black detective sergeant named Gordon was standing near the booking desk giving him the details . " They call the guy Pimp , " said Gordon , " but he 's not a pimp . He 's a  | mbler , mainly , and he probably does some dealing in drugs , but he ? resses like a pimp . You 'll see him in a minute . He 's back there in the ocker room wearing some kind of trick suit with a double-breasted vest . " ordon shook his head . " He 's sitting on the edge of a chair eating ribs , olding them like this " ? he leaned forward and raised his hand in a ? ainty gesture ? " so the sauce wo n't get on the suit . He had about forty uits , and when he tells you about those fucking suits , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The whole thing had happened because someone had stolen the forty suits . Oh , this was a real piece a shit . Waves and waves of childishness and pointless violence , and Kramer had n't even heard the whole story yet . The main room of the precinct was saturated with the dank and oddly sweet smell of rotting wood , caused by decades of steam radiators leaking into the floors . Most of the floor had been replaced with concrete . The ails were painted Government Work Green except for an old battered ? ngue-and-groove wainscoting , three feet high , around the bottom . The ? uilding had thick walls and high ceilings , now overgrown with trays of uorescent lights . Across the way Kramer could see the backs of the two . : trolmen . Their hips were enormous with weaponry and paraphernalia , eluding flashlights , summons books , walkie-talkies , and handcuffs . One ? f them kept lifting his hands in explanatory gestures to two women and man , local residents , whose faces said they did n't believe a word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in this apartment , and there 's ? ur guys in there , and one of them is this Andre Potts , who he figures ows who took the suits , only Andre says he do n't know nothing from othing , and they 're going back and forth , and finally Andres had ough of this , and he gets up and walks out of the room . And so what ould you do if some disrespectful sucker got up and turned his back on ou while you 're inquiring about your fucking forty suits ? You 'd shoot im in the back , right ? So that 's what Pimp did . He shot Mr. Andre otts in the back three times with a .38 . " " You got witnesses ? " asked Kramer . " Oh , we got ' em stacked up . " At that moment the beeper went off on Kramer 's waistband . " Can I use your phone ? " Gordon motioned toward an open door that led into the Detective Bureau , which was an office off the main room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At each desk sat a black man in his thirties or forties . Each had on Bronx street garb a bit too funky to be  | true . Kramer thought of how unusual it was to come across an entire bureau made up of black detectives . The one at the desk nearest the door wore a black thermal vest and a sleeveless black T-shirt that showed off his powerful arms . Kramer reached toward the telephone on his desk and said , " Use your phone ? " " Hey , what the fuck , man ! " Kramer pulled his hand back . " How long I got ta sit here chained up like a fucking animal ? " With that , the man raised his powerful left arm with a terrific clattering . There was a manacle on his wrist , and from the manacle a chain . The other end of the chain was manacled to the leg of the desk . Now the other two , at the other desks , had their arms up in the air , clattering and yammering . All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did was see the motherfucker whack that sucker , and he was the motherfucker that whacked that sucker , and I 'm the one you got chained up like a fucking animal , and that motherfucker " ? another terrific clatter as he gestured toward a room in the rear with his left hand ? " he 's sitting back there watching fucking TV and eating ribs . " Kramer looked to the back of the room , and sure enough , back there in a locker room was a figure sitting on the edge of a chair lit by the hectic flush of the television set and eating a length of barbecued rib of pork . And he was indeed leaning forward daintily . The sleeve of his jacket was tailored to show a lot of white cuff and gleaming cuff link . Now all three were yammering . Fucking ribs . . . fucking chains ! . . . fucking TV ! But of course ! The witnesses . Once Kramer realized that , everything , chains and all , fell into place . " Yeah , okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impatient fashion , " I 'll take care a you in a minute . I got ta make a phone call . " Fucking ribs ! . . . shee-uh ! . . . fucking chains ! Kramer called the office , and Gloria , Bernie Fitzgibbon 's secretary , said Milt Lubell wanted to talk to him . Lubell was Abe Weiss 's press secretary . Kramer barely knew Lubell ; he could n't remember talking to him more than four or five times . Gloria gave him Lubell 's number . Milt Lubell had worked on the old New York Mirror back when Walter Winchell still had his column . He had known the great man ever so slightly and had carried his breathless snap-brim way of talking onward into the last days of the twentieth century . " Kramer , " he said , " Kramer , Kramer , lemme see , Kramer . Yeah ,  | yeah , yeah , okay , I got it . The case of Henry Lamb . Likely to die . What 's h amount to ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I got a query from The City Light , some Brit named Fallow . Guy 's got this accent . I thought I was listening to Channel 13 . Anyway , ' s reading me a statement from Reverend Bacon about the case of enry Lamb . That 's all I need . The words of Reverend Reginald Bacon a British accent . You know Bacon ? " " Yeah , " said Kramer . " I interviewed Henry Lamb 's mother in Bacon 's ce . " " This guy has something from her , too , but mainly it 's Bacon . Lemme , lemme see , lemme see . It says , uh . . . blah blah blah , blah blah h . . . human life in the Bronx . . . malfeasance . . . white middle s . . . blah blah blah . . . nuclear magnetic resonance . . . Goes about the nuclear magnetic resonance . There 's maybe two a the fuckmachines in the whole country , I think . . . blah blah blah . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district attorney of dragging his t . We wo n't go to the trouble of proceeding with the case because the i is a black youth from the Poe projects and it 's too much trouble . " " That 's bullshit . " " Well , I know that , and you know that , but I got ta call this Brit back d tell him something . " A tremendous clatter . " How long I got ta sit here in these chains , in ! " The man with the big arms was erupting again . " This is against e law ! " " Hey ! " said Kramer , genuinely annoyed . " You wan na get outta here , u 'll knock it off . I ca n't fucking hear myself talk . " Then to Lubell : rry , I 'm over at the precinct . " He wrapped his hand around his uth and the mouthpiece of the telephone and said in a low voice : ey got three homicide witnesses over here chained to the fucking desk in the Detective Bureau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - level macho jolt of trotting out this little war story for Lubell , even ugh he did n't even know the man . " The desk legs ! " said Lubell , with an appreciative note . " Jesus Christ , t I never heard of . " " Anyway , " said Kramer , " where was I ? Okay , we got a Mercedesz with a license plate beginning with R. For a start , we do n't even w if we 're talking about a New York State license plate . Okay ? That 's a start . But let 's suppose we are . There 's 2,500 Mercedes registered in York State with license plates starting with R. Okay , now , the  | second letter supposedly looks like an E or an F , or maybe a P or a B or an R , some letter with a vertical on the left and some horizontals going r t. off of it . Suppose we go with that . We 're still talking about almost tier hundred cars . So whaddaya do ? Go after five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you the boy was hit by such a car , maybe you do But there 's no witness , except for the kid , and he 's in a coma and is n't coming out . We got no information about a driver . All we have is two people in a car , two white people , a man and a woman , and on top of that the kid 's story do n't add up in the first place . " " Well , whadda I say ? The investigation is continuing ? " " Yeah . The investigation is continuing . But unless Martin finds a wit ness , there 's no case here . Even if the kid was hit by a car , it probahl was n't the kind of collision that would yield forensic evidence from t car , because the kid do n't have the bodily injuries that are consistent wit such a collision  --  I mean , f'r Chrissake , there are so many fucking ifs ' this cockamamie story . If you ask me , it 's a piece a shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so does his mother , but between you and me , think he got in some kind of scrape and made up this bullshit story to t his mother . " " Well then , why would he dream up part of a license plate ? W would n't he say he did n't get the number ? " " How do I know ? Why does anybody do anything that they do in t country ? You think this guy , this reporter , is actually gon na write so thing ? " " I do n't know . I 'm just gon na say that naturally we 're following thing closely . " " Anybody else called you about it ? " " Naw . It sounds like Bacon reached this guy some way . " " What does Bacon get out of it ? " " Oh , this is one of the hobby horses he rides . The double stands doll white justice , blah blah blah . He 's always out to embarrass the Mayor . " Well , " said Kramer , " if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then he 's a magician . " By the time Kramer hung up , the three shackled witnesses were cl tering and complaining again . With a heavy heart he realized he actually going to have to sit down and talk to these three germs and something coherent out of them about a man named Pimp who shot man who knew a man who may or may not have known the whereaho of forty suits . His entire Friday night was going to get shot in the ass , he would have to shoot dice with Fate and ride the subway back down  | Manhattan . He looked back into the locker room once more . That very vision himself , that Gentleman 's Quarterly cover boy , the man named Pimp , was still back there , eating ribs and hugely enjoying something on the TV , which lit up his face in tones of first-degree-burn pink and cobalt , therapy blue . Kramer stepped outside the Detective Bureau and said to Gordon : " Your witnesses are getting kinda restless in there . That one guy wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to put the chain on him . " " I know that . But lemme ask you something . This fellow Pimp , he 's just sitting hack there eating ribs . He 's not chained to anything . " " Oh , I 'm not worried about Pimp . He 's not going anywhere . He 's cooling out . He 's contented . This crummy neighborhood is all he knows . i bet he do n't know New York is on the Atlantic Ocean . He 's a home boy . No , he 's not going anywhere . He 's only the perpetrator . But a witness  --  hey , baby , if I did n't put the chain on the witness , you would n't have no-o-o-o-o-body to interview . You 'd never see his ass again . A fucking witness 'll cut out for Santo Domingo faster'n you can say off-peak fare . " p Kramer headed back to the Detective Bureau to do his duty and interview the three irate citizens in chains and try to find some order in this latest piece a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was only a skeleton crew in the city room on Saturday afternoons . Most of them were wire-copy editors , scavenging through the material that continued to come stuttering and shuddering out of the Associated Press and United Press International machines for items that might be of use for Monday 's edition . There were three reporters in the city room , plus one down at Manhattan Central Police Headquarters , in case there occurred me catastrophe or piece of mayhem so gory that The City Light 's readwould still want to lap it up on Monday . There was a lone assistant ' ty editor , who spent most of the afternoon on the telephone , making les calls on the City Light 's WATS line , for a sideline of his , which was ! ling college fraternity jewelry , wholesale , to fraternity house managers , ho sold the stuff , the tie tacks and rings and pledge pins and whatnot , to be brothers at retail and kept the difference for themselves . The boredom d lassitude of these sentinels of the press could scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also Peter Fallow . Fallow , by contrast , was fervor personified . Of the various cubicles  | around the edges of the city room , his was the only one in use . He was perched on the edge of his chair with the telephone at his ear and a Biro in his hand . He was so keyed up , his excitement cut through today 's hangover with something approaching clarity . On his desk was a telephone directory for Nassau County , which was on Long Island . A great hefty thing , it was , this directory . He had never heard of Nassau County , although he now reckoned he must have passed through it during the weekend when he had managed to inspire St. John 's superior at the museum , Virgil Gooch III  --  the Yanks loved to string Roman numerals after their sons ' names  --  to invite him to his ludicrously grand house by the ocean in East Hampton , Long Island . There was no second invitation , but . . . ah , well , ah , well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the county of Nassau , its existence on the face of the earth was news to him , but somewhere in the town of Hewlett a telephone was ringing , and he desperately wanted it to be answered . Finally , after seven rings , it was . " Hello ? " Out of breath . " Mr. Rif kind ? " " Yes . . . " Out of breath and wary . " This is Peter Fallow of the New York City Light . " " Do n't want any . " " Excuse me ? I do hope you 'll forgive me for ringing you up on a Saturday afternoon . " " You hope wrong . I subscribed to the Times once . Actually got it about once a week . " " No , no , no , I 'm not ? " " Either somebody swiped it from the front door before I left the house or it was soaking wet or it was never delivered . " " No , I 'm a journalist , Mr. Rifkind . I write for The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact to Mr. Rifkind 's satisfaction . " Well , okay , " said Mr. Rif kind , " go ahead . I was just out in the driveway having a few beers and making a FOR SALE sign to put up in the window of my car . You 're not by any chance in the market for a 1981 Thunderbird . " " I 'm afraid not , " said Fallow with a chortle , as if Mr. Rifkind were one of the great Saturday-afternoon wits of his experience . " Actually , I 'm calling to inquire about one of your students , a young Mr. Henry Lamb . " " Henry Lamb . Does n't ring a bell . What 's he done ? " Oh , he has n't done anything . He 's been seriously injured . " He proceeded to lay out the facts of the case , stacking them rather heavily  | toward the Albert Vogel  --  Reverend Bacon theory of the incident . " I was told he was a student in your English class . " " Who told you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long talk with her . She 's a very nice woman and very upset , as you can imagine . " " Henry Lamb . . . Oh yes , I know who you mean . Well , that 's tOO i bad . " " What I would like to find out , Mr. Rifkind , is what kind of student Henry Lamb is . " " What kind ? " " Well , would you say he was an outstanding student ? " " Where are you from , Mr. ? I 'm sorry , tell me your name again ? " " Fallow . " " Mr. Fallow . I gather you 're not from New York . " " That 's true . " " Then there 's no reason why you should know anything about Colonel acob Ruppert High School in the Bronx . At Ruppert we use compara 've terms , but outstanding is n't one of them . The range runs more from cooperative to life-threatening . " Mr. Rifkind began to chuckle . " F'r Chrissake , do n't say I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb ? " " Cooperative . He 's a nice fellow . Never gives me any trouble . " " Would you describe him as a good student ? " " Good does n't work too well at Ruppert , either . It 's more Does he ttend class or does n't he ? ' " " Did Henry Lamb attend class ? " " As I recall , yes . He 's usually there . He 's very dependable . He 's a nice id , as nice as they come . " " Was there any part of the curriculum he was particularly good  --  or , . me say , adept at , anything he did better than anything else ? " " Not particularly . " " No ? " " It 's difficult to explain , Mr. Fallow . As the saying goes , Ex nihilo hil fit . ' There 's not a great range of activities in these classes , and so it 's . rd to compare performances . These boys and girls  --  sometimes their inds are in the classroom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb ? " " He 's a nice fellow . He 's polite , he pays attention , he does n't give me y trouble . He tries to learn . "  | " Well , he must have some abilities . His mother told me he was considering going to college . " " That may well be . She 's probably talking about C.C.N.Y. That 's the City College of New York . " " I believe Mrs. Lamb did mention that . " " City College has an open-admissions policy . If you live in New York City and you 're a high-school graduate and you want to go to City College , you can go . " " Will Henry Lamb graduate , or would he have ? " " As far as I know . As I say , he has a very good attendance record . " " How do you think he would have fared as a college student ? " A sigh . " I do n't know . I ca n't imagine what happens with these kids when they enter City College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me anything at all about Henry Lamb 's performance or his aptitude , anything at all ? " " You have to understand that they give me about sixty-five students in each class when the year starts , because they know it 'll be down to forty by mid-year and thirty by the end of the year . Even thirty 's too many . but that 's what I get . It 's not exactly what you 'd call a tutorial system . Henry Lamb 's a nice young man who applies himself and wants an education . What more can I tell you ? " " Let me ask you this . How does he do on his written work ? " Mr. Rifkind let out a whoop . " Written work ? There has n't been any written work at Ruppert High for fifteen years ! Maybe twenty ! They take multiple-choice tests . Reading comprehension , that 's the big thing . That 's all the Board of Education cares about . " " How was Henry Lamb 's reading comprehension ? " " I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to guess . " " Better than most ? Or about average ? Or what would you say ? " " Well . . . I know it must be difficult for you to understand , Mr. Fallow , being from England . Am I right ? You 're British ? " " Yes , I am . " " Naturally  --  or I guess it 's natural  --  you 're used to levels of excellence and so forth . But these kids have n't reached the level where it 's worth emphasizing the kind of comparisons you 're talking about . We 're just trying to get them up to a certain level and then keep them from falling back . You 're thinking about honor students ' and higher achievers ' and all that , and that 's natural enough , as I say . But at Colonel Jacob Ruppert High School , an honor student is somebody who attends class , is n't disruptive , tries to learn , and does all right at reading and arithmetic . "  | " Well , let 's use that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor student ? " " By that standard , yes . " " Thank you very much , Mr. Rifkind . " " That 's okay . I 'm sorry to hear about all this . Seems like a nice boy . We 're not supposed to call them boys , but that 's what they are , poor sad Ionfused boys with a whole lotta problems . Do n't quote me , for Christ 's Mike , or I 'll have a whole lotta problems . Hey , listen . You sure you Ipuld n't use a 1981 Thunderbird ? "
