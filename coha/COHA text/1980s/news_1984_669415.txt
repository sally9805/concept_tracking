Those mass movements gave him the improbable idea of using satellites to link groups of people in the United States and the Soviet Union to talk about avoiding nuclear war - to get impressions of each other as people , rather than ' ' the enemy . ' ' Maybe even to dance to each other ' s music , or sing each other ' s songs. // Fat chance . As if the language , communication , and distance barriers could be breached . As if the cost would be less than , well , astronomical . As if the Soviets would allow it. // So what ' s Kim Spencer doing in the pre-dawn hours of a snowy Moscow morning ? // He ' s huddled with officials of the Soviet State Committee for Radio and Television ( Gosteleradio ) ironing out the final details of a satellite transmission between San Francisco and Moscow , during which participants will talk about avoiding nuclear war and sing songs. // It ' s the sixth such link that ' s taken place between the two superpowers in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internews Project , has been involved , in one way or another , in most of them . Taken together , these ' ' satellite bridges , ' ' as they have been dubbed , represent a technical tour de force - and an example of a unique kind of cooperation that has endured stormy political relationships between the two countries. // To hear both Soviet and American enthusiasts tell it , what ' s been accomplished so far only hints at things to come . One Soviet producer says he ' d like to see sports events beamed between the nations , with bilingual explanations of the rules and play-by-play. // Spencer is toying with an even more ambitious idea : a three-ring circus-by-satellite , with acts beamed simultaneously from Moscow , New York , and Peking. // To be sure , these ' ' bridges ' ' are more than entertainment . They are used for political purposes in both countries . They have provided opportunities for American scientists , entertainers , and issue groups to get an audience in Moscow . And Moscow gets to present a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' I think , ' ' says Spencer , ' ' that the Soviets have a different view of what television is . It has to do with their view of propaganda , which we see as a totally pejorative concept . They see it as an opportunity to inform , to persuade . . . . They use it to try to depict the realities of the world , or at least the realities as they see them. ' ' // A Gosteleradio producer voices similar sentiments. // ' ' Space bridges , ' ' he says , do away with the ' ' prism ' ' of newspapers and commercial TV through which most Americans see the USSR . Satellite links ' ' promote a better understanding than ( the ) somewhat biased look at Soviet reality ' ' shown by commercial media , he says. // The Soviet Union does maintain a tight control on the images it allows to cross these ' ' space bridges . ' ' Participants in Moscow are carefully screened , and so far none of the satellite programs have been broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on Soviet TV. // Spencer says he has carefully reviewed the Soviet versions , trying to answer the question , ' ' Are we being used ? ' ' // ' ' Basically , ' ' he says , ' ' they ' ve gone out pretty much as they happened. ' ' // Of course , the Soviets carefully pick and choose the programs in which they participate . But the idea behind every program so far has originated in the US. // The most recent ' ' satellite bridge ' ' seemed made for Moscow tastes . It was an awards ceremony sponsored by a San Francisco organization , ' ' Beyond War , ' ' which honored the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. // A prominent Soviet Communist Party member , Dr. Evgeny Chazov , is co-founder and co-president of the group . Its message - that nuclear war must be avoided and nuclear arsenals reduced - has Moscow ' s fervent backing . ( Critics would say it is for the purpose of swaying American public opinion toward unilateral arms reduction , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been less to the award than met the eye . Both Dr. Chazov and his co-recipient were members of the selection committee that chose them as award winners . They could have accepted in one spot without satellite. // But perhaps a satellite link provides its own rationale . The technology becomes part of the event . For example , even a hardened cynic might have been moved by the sound and sight of a San Francisco boy ' s choir and a Gosteleradio children ' s choir singing together , though halfway around the world . Their electronic images arced through space , and reappeared as one on giant video screens in each city. // In a 1983 ' ' space bridge , ' ' the Moscow rock group Arsenal played songs that set crowds to dancing in the California desert near San Bernardino . Other ' ' bridges ' ' have been used to discuss the possibility of a ' ' nuclear winter ' ' as well as to facilitate a meeting of scientists for discussions of fusion and seismic research. // In the latest video-audio hookup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ostakino went by phone lines to Dubna , north of the Soviet capital . From there , it was converted into a satellite signal , and beamed to an Intelsat satellite over the Atlantic . The signal came down in Etam , West Virginia , where it was sent via phone lines to New York . Then it was rebeamed to the Westar 5 satellite over the American Midwest , and then down to a portable satellite dish in a park across the street from San Francisco ' s Masonic auditorium . A final microwave link sent it across the street , to a van packed with electronic hardware , where the electronic images were blended into a 90-minute program . This signal was then rebeamed to yet another satellite , which provided the program to number of public and cable TV stations . And yet another satellite signal retraced this route in reverse , from San Francisco to Moscow. // ' ' Technically , they ' re very good , ' ' Spencer says of the Soviet satellite team. // ' ' And once the decision has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight . They ' re very professional. ' ' // //
