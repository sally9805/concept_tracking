The word from a number of observers on the collectibles front is that now is a good time to buy . An expected upsurge in inflation is seen as likely to push prices of art , rare coins and stamps , rugs , and other collectibles back to the levels of ' ' the halcyon days of the late ' 70s , ' ' as one expert puts it , and beyond. // But - and this is an important but - there is still no substitute for solid knowledge of the field in which you intend to collect . The best investors are those who are knowledgeable , indeed , ' ' passionate ' ' collectors. // However - and this is an equally important however - it ' s not that hard to develop expertise . The key is to define an area of specialty narrow enough that you can really become expert in it. // Numismatists and other experts on tangibles generally agree that tangibles are not a short-term investment . Glenn Miller , senior numismatist of the New England Rare Coin Galleries in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expects to peak again in late 1986 or early 1987. // He advises investors to go into only the highest grade coins , specifically , 19th-century US or early 20th-century US gold coins in an uncirculated condition known as mint state 65 - MS 65 . He also advises people to hold them for three or four years. // He argues that the fall in bullion prices , which began in early 1980 , did not drag coin prices down as far as the earlier rise in bullion prices had pushed them up . ' ' A $20 gold piece that sold at $1 , 800 in 1980 , when the price of bullion was $850 an ounce , is still selling for about that today , ' ' with bullion around $400. // John C. Porter , vice-president of the rare stamp and coin division of Newhard , Cook &; Co. in St. Louis , suggests that such a coin would probably sell today for $1 , 500 to $1 , 600 , but agrees that coin-price falloffs have not been so great as those of bullion prices. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' conservative , very traditional brokerage , ' ' says that coins have yielded an average annual compounded return of 27. 5 percent over the past 30 years . He calls this ' ' an excellent time to buy , ' ' particularly for investors looking for diversification. // He is expecting such an upsurge in inflation , with an attendant upsurge in coin prices , to hit this year . Just in the last several weeks he has seen a new wave of interest in coins , both from first-time investors and from those seeking to expand existing portfolios . And stamps , he says , have a similar potential. // Inflationary periods are considered the best time to buy tangibles . Mr. Porter argues that it ' s not only inflation , but the rate of change in inflation , that affects the psychology of buying . ' ' If there is a belief that inflation will return , that anticipation has dramatic results. ' ' // But Larry Biehl , vice-president of Bailard , Biehl , &; Kaiser , financial planners in San Mateo , Calif. , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in inflation rates that drives prices up ; rather , it ' s the perception that inflation will be a problem . ' ' I don ' t think inflation will reignite . ' ' He expects inflation to be under 5 percent for 1984 and under 7 percent next year ; neither figure , he feels , is likely to panic people into inflation hedges. // Mr. Biehl also feels tangibles bought purely for investment are not something for a long-term hold . Rather , they are best purchased at the end of the business cycle , during a period of ' ' runaway ' ' inflation - and we aren ' t there yet , he says . Better keep your money in money-market mutual funds for another year or so , and then plan to get out after six months - or a year to get a lower capital gains tax rate. // For those who do want to take the plunge into tangibles right now , though , the recommendation is to work with a broker on commission , if possible , rather than a dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have problems with a dealer . If he ' s got 49 gold coins and he wants to have 42 , he can call you up and say that suddenly he ' s got a great deal for you on seven gold coins , ' ' says Tony Crumbley , a coin and stamp consultant in Charlotte , N.C. ' ' On the other hand , you could have a broker who ' s in cahoots with a dealer , and that wouldn ' t be any good either. ' ' // If you want to find a broker , Mr. Crumbley recommends checking for those advertising in hobby magazines . Also , some financial planners go into coins and stamps ; their ads are to be found in personal finance magazines , he says . But , he adds , ' ' The best thing to do is to take the time to learn about coins. ' ' // ' ' The people who have been the most successful investors are those who have been collectors , ' ' Mr. Porter concurs , // Coin collectors can educate themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colo. ; by attending coin shows , and by subscribing to numismatic magazines . A collector who must work with a dealer should look for someone who has been in business at least 10 years or so , and who can buy back at a fair market price the coins it sells. // A related area , much less well known , he says , is antique currency . Early US banknotes - those issued by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution , the first notes on which the words ' ' United States ' ' were used - are often available inexpensively , for $125 to $200 . ' ' The early bills were signed by hand , with quill pens , one signature on the lower denominations , and three on the higher denominations , ' ' Mr. Porter says . ' ' And they were signed by some of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution . And some of these notes were printed by Ben Franklin - or engraved by Paul Revere. ' ' // Joseph Deitch , president of the Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious on collectibles . ' ' One could say this is a nice time to buy , a reasonable time . Prices are a lot lower than four years ago . But , ' ' he adds , ' ' Investments are hard enough anyway - and collectibles are even worse. ' ' // Unlike stocks , for example , where the ' ' bid ' ' and ' ' ask ' ' prices are very close together , collectibles are sold , like any other retail goods , at a markup , typically 100 percent . ' ' You might find a dealer who says , ' Our markup is 20 percent . ' But then you have to ask , 20 percent over what ? They may get a $100 item at $60 , but instead of charging a 20 percent markup on what they paid , which would be $72 , they charge a 20 percent markup over normal wholesale - $120 , which comes out to be 100 percent markup over $60 . A lot of these people make their money by buying cheap. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in the coin market , and is skeptical of dealers and brokers . ' ' Stay away from them. ' ' // He adds , ' ' At best , you ' re going to pay market rate for things you get through them ; at worst you ' ll pay the market rate for a coin that isn ' t worth quite what you think. ' ' // He recommends developing expertise on your own , or hiring an expert for the occasion - ' ' Even your neighbor ' s 14-year-old kid who knows about coins . Give ' em $5 to come with you to a coin show . It ' s like going to the Haymarket with a housewife from the North End , who goes there all the time , ' ' he says , referring to Boston ' s somewhat rough-and-tumble open-air produce market , adjacent to the colorful Italian section . He suggests haggling over prices - and paying cash. // The best art investments are the best art , ' ' those works of art that really capture something of value about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dean of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston . ' ' There ' s always a market for Rembrandt . The quality of the work , the aesthetic values are what really holds value. ' ' // For those unable to finance Rembrandts out of petty cash , Mr. McDonald recommends young artists - ' ' They ' re the bargains , and they end up as expensive as anything . ' ' He recommends finding a specialty and working at becoming an expert - through avid museum going , art history courses , and gallery hopping , reading the local and national art publications , ' ' Art in America , ' ' for example , going to lectures , keeping in touch with local art associations . ' ' You should ask yourself , ' Do I see a strong personal statement here ? ' ' ' // J. Brian Cole , senior vice-president of Christie ' s in New York says the art market has had a good boost just in the last six months . Jewelry , rugs , good furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halcyon days of the late ' 70s . ' ' Some areas , though , ' ' have yet to unfold , ' ' as he puts it. // Photographs are one area that has been ' ' overexploited and overexposed ' ' - even in the case of the internationally recognized masters . There has been some rebounding of prices over the past couple of years , but not that much . Ansel Adams ' s ' ' Moonrise , Hernandez , New Mexico , ' ' is in itself almost an index of the photography market . This photo , selling at $10 , 000 or $15 , 000 about four years ago , was down to $4 , 000 a couple of years ago , and is back up to $6 , 000 or so today , Mr.Cole says. // Original prints - old masters and modern prints - have not suffered so much in price as other groups. // Like many connoisseurs , David Redden , director of the book , print , and photograph department of Sotheby ' s , sounds rather pained to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' It ' s probably a good time to collect . ' ' Like the others , he preaches : ' ' Become a connoisseur . ' ' If you define your specialty narrowly enough , it ' s not unreasonable to expect you ' ll soon know more about your field than the dealers you do business with . A professional art dealer often has to know everything about everything , ' ' and thus must spread himself rather thin. // The builder of an ' ' intelligent collection ' ' can rather easily find that collection setting a standard in its field , says Mr. Redden . Can those of us whose names are not Rockefeller or Mellon do this ? ' ' Well , yes , in book collecting , for example ; there are endless wonderful books under $50 , ' ' he says , although Sotheby ' s itself generally does not handle such bargain-basement treasures. // He recommends the public library as a way to start with the ' ' endless publications ' ' available , attending auctions , and considering their catalogs. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s - ' ' That ' s something you can ' t do in a museum.
