Citizens sound off on taxes , pols and nukes <P> Not since the 1930s , when the Depression brought a spate of voter initiatives to the ballot , have citizens themselves proposed so many new laws-and limits-for government . David Schmidt , editor of Initiative News Report , describes it accurately as " a new national trend to lawmaking at the ballot box . " In 18 states and the District of Columbia , voters put on the ballot a total of 42 referendums . Their actions ranged from a nonbinding vote by five southern New Jersey counties to secede from the state to a decision by residents of Washington , D.C. , to take a first step toward statehood by calling for a Constitutional Convention ; from the lifting of an eight-year ban on hunting mourning doves in South Dakota to the approval of bingo playing in Texas . Many of the initiatives reflected an impatience with politicians and an eagerness by the electorate to take matters into their own hands . Some of the most significant : <P> Taxes : Sons of Proposition 13 . Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , Proposition 13 fever has been spreading across the country . This week tax-cutting measures appeared on ten state ballots . The tax revolt hit hardest in Massachusetts , a state that has long been dubbed Taxachusetts because of its high levies , including a property tax 70% higher than the national average . Bay Staters voted drastic relief in the form of Proposition 2 , which will limit a homeowner 's property tax to 2.5% of the full market value , reduce the motor vehicle excise tax by 62% and allow renters to deduct 50% of then-annual rent from state income tax . State employees , teachers and labor leaders maintained that " 2 " would force the average municipality to cut its budget by 40% , thus crippling public education as well as police and fire protection . The majority of homeowners evidently were swayed by arguments that the cuts could come from bureaucratic fat . Unlike California in its Proposition 13 days , however , Massachusetts lacks a budget surplus to cushion the blow , estimated at a $600 million loss in state revenues for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar proposal that would have rolled back property assessments to 1978 levels , then cut taxes in half . The Tisch amendment , named after the Shiawassee County drain commissioner who drew up the proposal , at first had broad support led by homeowners and real estate developers , who believed that a revitalized economy would make up for the lost tax revenues . But Governor William Milliken , who had already cut more than $100 million from the budget this year , estimated that the amendment would cost the state an annual $2 billion . Michigan , Milliken said , would have to fire 24,000 state workers , close 84 state parks and 180 campgrounds , eliminate 7,000 beds for state mental patients , end financial aid to twelve of its 15 state colleges and universities and dismiss 75% of the state police force . His statistics were persuasive . <P> Other tax-cutting proposals patterned after Proposition 13 were defeated in Nevada , Arizona , Oregon , Utah and South Dakota . Ohio voters , however , endorsed new methods of computing property taxes on homes and farms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tie all state tax increases to the federal Consumer Price Index .
