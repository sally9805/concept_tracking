It has been called " aural wallpaper , " " music for the Birkenstock crowd " and " yuppie elevator music . " Its titles evoke a holistic , hot-tubbing world : Etosha  --  Private Music in the Land of Dry Water , Aerial Boundaries , Nirvana Road . Although its composers include musicians prominent in the rock avant- garde , it is marked by a meditative aesthetic whose goal is often creative anonymity . A laid-back synthesis of folk , jazz and classical influences , it is called , by rough convention , New Age music . But what exactly is it ? <P> " New Age music is the sound track for the movie of the mind , " says English-born Rocker Eddie Jobson , formerly of Roxy Music and U.K. and now a leading New Age pianist and composer . " It is music that springs from a world culture , " says Lucia Hwong , a Chinese American whose music turned up in the 1985 movie Year of the Dragon . Trying to define the style reduces Anne Robinson , a cofounder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words together that sound like an exotic disease identified by a German doctor . New acoustic classical jazz ? New acoustic impressionistic music ? " <P> However it is defined , New Age has arrived .

Bach composed the Goldberg Variations to ease the slumbers of an insomniac , and his contemporary , Telemann , wrote reams of Tafelmusik , music intended as background to dining .

The percentage may seem small , but it compares favorably with that garnered by classical music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synonymous with the new style , last year grossed $25 million . In a hard-driving business , Windham Hill 's success is anomalous , for the label is rarely heard on the radio , and it advertises only occasionally . Instead , it relies on word of mouth among its target audience of young white professionals . It must be doing something right : Pianist George Winston , perhaps the best known of its largely faceless roster , has been on Billboard 's Top 40 jazz chart a total of 184 weeks with his album December , a user-friendly amalgam of Bach , Satie and Jazzman Keith Jarrett . <P> Last year a challenge to Windham Hill 's hegemony sprang up with Private Music , a label founded by Peter Baumann , former keyboard player of the rock group Tangerine Dream . Two of Private Music 's early releases are among the best New Age albums so far : Rock Violinist Jerry Goodman 's high-flying On the Future of Aviation and the anthology Piano One , which features hypnotic solo performances by Jobson and Japan 's Ryuichi Sakamoto , among others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very visual , " says the Berlin-born Baumann . " One important aspect is the absence of lyrics , which gives the listener a much wider range of associations . "
