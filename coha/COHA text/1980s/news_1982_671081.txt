To be sure , the question of who should market the coins that are to help finance the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles does not rank with , say , nuclear arms policy or budget compromise . But don ' t try to tell Mr. Annunzio that his campaign against allowing private companies to profit from selling Government-minted Olympic coins isn ' t worth the extraordinary battle he ' s been waging. // " I will do everything in my power , " said the 67-year old Chicagoan . " If I succeed , fine . If I don ' t succeed , I tried . " At stake is up to $1. 5 billion in sales of special coins that would be a major source of financing for the Olympics and would offer a potential profit of up to $100 million for private companies. // More than 11 months have passed since the first bill dealing with 1984 Olympic coinage was introduced in Congress and , largely because of Mr. Annunzio , there is no resolution in sight . <> <> ' Living-Room Lobby ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of Congress , Mr. Annunzio sought to take his case for one gold and one silver Treasury-marketed Olympic coin directly to the public as opposed to the 17 coins now backed by a group of private companies. // " I am asking Americans across this country who believe in the importance of the Olympic Games to form a ' living room lobby ' designed to show support for a single-coin program , " he said in a Capitol Hill news conference . He noted that he had made arrangements with the House Postmaster for a special mailing address. // Behind the various , seemingly innocuous bills to authorize Olympic coinage is an emotionally charged , big-money legislative fight of unusual ferocity . Essentially , it pits Mr. Annunzio and the nation ' s coin dealers against three large companies seeking the coin franchise . The companies , Occidental Petroleum , Lazard Freres and the Franklin Mint , have engaged three of the capital ' s most powerful lobbying firms : Gray &; Company , Timmons &; Company and Patton , Boggs &; Blow . They are supported in turn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organizing Committee and the athletes themselves who , some say , believe that Mr. Annunzio is , in effect , delaying preparations for the games and may be risking the financing of them. // The companies , which have come to be known as the private marketers , see Mr. Annunzio as the personification of Federal meddling and ineptitude , a man who , while expressing support for athletes already frustrated by their inability to compete in the 1980 Moscow games , has betrayed them for the sake of an outmoded principle . <> <> ' A Sense of Outrage ' // " There is a sense of outrage among the athletes that he is offering himself as the protector of the athletes " while opposing bills they favor , said Christopher A. Knepp , a former member of an amateur world championship baseball team who serves on the Athletes Advisory Council. // This charge and others made by the high-powered lobbyists have had little effect , however , except to cause Mr. Annunzio to lash back . " Had I sold out the interest of the athletes to the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most intense personal lobbying campaign that I have witnessed in my 18 years in Congress , " Mr. Annunzio said earlier this month . " Good legislation stands on its own two feet , not on the wallets of private interests. " // The private marketers , also known as the " coin group , " want the House to pass a bill like that approved in December by the Senate , virtually without opposition . It calls for the Treasury to strike copper-nickel , silver and gold Olympic coins worth $325 million retail , which would be legal tender and thus of interest to coin collectors as well as those who would buy them for as souvenirs . <> <> Fear of Failure // The companies would then sell the coins worldwide at prices two or three times face value , with the profits , perhaps as much as $300 million , shared equally with the Olympic and Los Angeles committees . The group would put up $30 million in advance as a guarantee. // Mr. Annunzio opposes this for several reasons . For one thing , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , would not be able to afford a whole set costing thousands of dollars , and might not buy any , causing the program to fail. // For another , the Government should not revive the " racket " under which the Government from 1892 to 1954 minted 157 commemorative coins and sold them at face value to sometimes dubious private sponsors . In the process , critics argued , they trivialized and overcommercialized the United States Treasury franchise. <> <> $50 Million Guarantee // Mr. Annunzio ' s amended bill , which he calls " scandalproof , " provides for the Treasury to mint a $1 silver coin , dated 1983 and 1984 , and a $10 gold coin , dated 1984 , that it would offer the public directly at a price yielding a $10 or $15 profit . The Los Angeles committee would get 30 percent of the profit and the other 70 percent would go for training athletes . The Government would provide a $50 million guarantee . The coin group could bid for the overseas distribution rights , but the markup would be limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a standoff , one complicated earlier this month when the Occidental group exercised its right to pull out of the deal . The next week it said it would reconsider. // Meanwhile , the chairman of the House Banking Committee , Fernand J. St. Germain , a Rhode Island Democrat , has introduced a compromise that is similar to the Senate bill while adding safeguards . The Administration has recently added its support. // Mr. Annunzio remains adamant , although he has agreed to have his subcommittee consider the legislation on May 13 . " I ' m against private marketing , " he insists . Besides seeking to do the best thing for the athletes and the Government , he said , his views were also those of ordinary people , " the guy who ' s got $25 bucks " to spend on Olympic coins. // Being portrayed as an obstructionist by Washington lobbyists and the Los Angeles press hasn ' t fazed him a bit . " I ' m a hero in my district , " he retorts. //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
