Why do the Soviet missions to the United Nations in New York City employ more people than the next two biggest delegations , those of the U.S. and China , combined ? Because , Washington bluntly charged last week , many of the supposed Soviet diplomats are really spies . The accusation was contained in an equally blunt order : over the next two years , Moscow 's three missions ( two officially represent the Ukrainian and Belorussian Soviet Republics ) must reduce their staffs from a present total of 275 to 170 . The Soviets may choose who stays and who goes ; if they do not , the U.S. will make the decision by denying diplomatic visas . <P> Although no specific incident prompted the order , the Administration has been disturbed by Soviet espionage in the U.S. and is seeking to cut it down . The timing of the order may have another purpose : Washington is annoyed by what it regards as Kremlin stalling in arranging a follow-up to the Geneva summit that is supposed to be held in the U.S. this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , Moscow seemed equally displeased : the Soviet news agency TASS called the U.N . restriction an attempt to prevent any thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations .
