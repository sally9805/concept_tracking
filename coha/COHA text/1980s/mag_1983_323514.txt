THE LOSER by George Konrd Translated by Ivan Sanders ; Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; 315 pages ; $14.95 <P> George Konrd 's novels , each in its own harrowing way , have been maps of contemporary man 's journeys to the end of the night . The Hungarian writer 's first book , The Case Worker ( 1974 ) , charted the descent of a compassionate social worker into the degradation and suffering of Communism 's underclass . His second , more ideological novel , The City Builder ( 1978 ) , explored the pathways to the Utopias that have led to police terror and violence . By then it was clear that Hungary 's national tragedy had cast up a major writer , in a class with West Germany 's Heinrich Bll and the Polish exile Czeslaw Milosz . <P> In his latest novel , The Loser , Konrd takes the ultimate journey of the modern European , piling up horror upon horror on the way : the Holocaust , the Gulag , the carnage of World War II , the postwar purges in Eastern Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhumanity of the age is vast . Yet Konrd 's masterly new novel offers fresh insight into the cruel stratagems of totalitarian rule . <P> Astonishingly , Konrd , 49 , still lives and writes in Communist Hungary , where his novel passes from hand to hand in a process known by the Russian term samizdat : self-publishing . He has even been granted permission for a two-year stay in the West . Though Hungary has proved to be more forbearing of dissent than other countries in the Soviet bloc , Konrd is surprised by the degree of tolerance he has encountered at home . <P> " It is an amazing development , " Konrd said on a visit to New York City . " When I returned home in 1979 , after a stay abroad , I expected conditions to be the same as they were when I was arrested in 1975 , for supposedly having circulated a sociological study I had coauthored . Instead , I found a community of young intellectuals who had established a kind of network of free thought . Thousands of copies of serious magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my novel have already appeared in samizdat . " <P> Konrd 's sweetness of manner and luminous smile belie the visions of violence that invaded his childhood and have informed his fiction . The son of a Jewish shopkeeper , he was eleven years old when his parents were arrested under the Nazi occupation . The boy fled to Budapest and hid with other Jews in a house that was under the protection of a foreign embassy . The young fugitive scrounged for dry beans and moldy sausage . Searching for a relative in a ghetto hospital , he came upon a mountain of bodies that had been machine-gunned by Hungarian Nazis .
