Discovering : Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Scientific Knowledge By Robert Scott Root-Bernstein Harvard University Press , 501 pages , $35 Most of the scientists who have ever lived are living now , yet fundamental discoveries that reshape society are as rare as they ' ve ever been . This fascinating and deeply-researched book by a professor of natural history and physiology at Michigan State University attempts to determine why . Root-Bernstein ' s approach is fictional , and though ambitious and serious , never fails to entertain . He summons six imaginary characters to a coloquium to debate the subjective issues at the core of scientific discovery . The characters examine historical figures , bounce ideas off one another , and plumb their own minds in personal journals . As the author writes , they " praise , compare , condemn , poke fun , have fun , examine fun ; contemplate , expiate , prevaricate ; consent dissent , cajole and condescend . " Is there definable structure to the process of invention ? Who discovers ? What hurdles must they leap ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie in " personality , experience , self-revelation , " the author believes . Therefore the only way to understand is to try to re-create those flights of imagination . The six characters pore over the laboratory notebooks , correspondence , publications and lives of such discoverers as Louis Pasteur , Alexander Fleming , Claude Berthollet , J.H. van ' t Hoff and many others . They reconstruct historic experiments to determine how they came about in the first place . The culture of science is explored , particularly bizarre family trees of scientists related by accomplishment . The chemist J.F.A. von Baeyer , for instance , won a Nobel Prize , trained four Nobel Laureates , those trained six more , and so forth-17 altogether . Some 400 pages into the inquiry , Root-Bernstein begins to smooth the data into a coherent theory designed to help young scientists discover . Patterns do become evident . They lead to 50 pages of amazingly simple principles backed by examples . A few of them : No talent or skill is useless-look at the points where fields intersect . Action creates results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Try many things . " Do what makes your heart leap . " Think big . Formulate the problem but don ' t try to solve it until you can guess the answer . . . Dare to explore . Look for experiments that might undermine your preconceptions . Invent something big and new and try to disprove it . Be sloppy enough to let interesting things happen but not so sloppy that you can ' t tell . Play contradictions and implications . Look for anomalies . " Great scientists not only blow their own bubbles , they also pop most of them themselves . " Root-Bernstein ' s characters venture the heretical notion that the clustered , prize-ridden , hierarchical culture of modern science may actually impede important discovery . What do today ' s superstar **34;83;TOOLONG really think of seminal investigators like Mendel , a monk who discovered the laws of heredity in a monastery garden without federal grants ; Banting , who discovered insulin even though he didn ' t have a job , let alone tenure ; or Einstein , who spent his seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment science even listen to such outside maverick voices today ?
