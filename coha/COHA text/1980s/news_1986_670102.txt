Investors lucky enough to get a piece of Home Shopping Network Inc. ' s initial public stock offering last spring made a killing . The company ' s shares , which were offered at $18 each , jumped to $42. 625 on the first day of trading and subsequently soared as high as $133 before splitting three-for-one . But picking a winner from the stream of new stocks coming on the market isn ' t easy . And even individuals with a knack for identifying a hot new offering often find that actually buying the shares can be a real problem . For instance , investors who didn ' t have an account at Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith Inc. , which managed the Home Shopping issue , had little chance of buying the company ' s shares at the offering price . Even Merrill ' s oldest and best customers couldn ' t get all of the stock they wanted . " The little investor ' s chance of getting into a really hot new issue is less than hitting the lottery , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small New York brokerage firm that specializes in stocks in the over-the-counter market . Still , there are some ways individual investors can even the odds a bit  --  even now as the number of new issues is starting to slow . But they first need to understand how the volatile new-issue market works . Three groups of investors dominate the market for hot new stocks . Institutional investors , particularly those who in the past have been willing to buy chunks of less spectacular issues from the underwriting brokerage firm , head the list . Some 40% of the Home Shopping shares , for instance , went to institutions , primarily regular Merrill Lynch customers . Next come the underwriting firm ' s loyal retail customers . Merrill Lynch made specific allotments of Home Shopping shares to its branch offices , based on business done by each . Home Shopping shares at the issue price generally weren ' t offered outside the firm . The best customers theoretically got the most shares . Third are the so-called " hedge funds , " investment pools that operate at the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge funds use certain techniques like barter and short selling to make a profit . Typically , hedge funds take positions in new offerings when the shares are first issued , then sell when the stock opens for public trading later that same day . The hedge funds are engaged in a kind of arbitrage . Because underwriters deliberately try to underprice new issues slightly to create investor interest , the price often pops upward temporarily when the stock starts trading . For the hottest new issues , that " pop " could average 10% or more on the one-day investment  --  a $100 , 000 profit on a $1 million investment . Few of these funds are known beyond the inner circles of Wall Street , but in some initial public offerings , the funds end up with 20% and more of the shares issued . Merrill Lynch won ' t say how much hedge funds got in the case of Home Shopping , but the firm concedes that the funds ' portion cut equally into the institutional and retail allotments . That pattern is standard for most underwritings done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of hot issues as possible , hedge funds typically offer to buy large quantities of slow-moving securities from underwriters . To the hedgers , the new-issues market is more than guesswork . Estimating where an initial offering will go on opening day is their business . Small investors , of course , aren ' t in a position to match their sophistication . But here are some suggestions from Wall Street professionals on how individuals can increase their odds of spotting the next Home Shopping Network . Plugging In For information about new issues , newsletters are a poor second choice to first-hand access to the market ' s big players . Individual investors who don ' t have the luxury of talking to such people directly should try to find someone who does . Managers of new-offering syndicates fit this bill , and the best chances are with the smallest firms involved in initial public offerings . Don ' t expect them to be chatty , but it is sometimes possible to get them on the phone . " I ' ll talk with people , because it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O ' Shea , syndicate manager for Yamner &; Co. in New York . Widening the Network Open lots of brokerage accounts . " Big investors open accounts with 33 firms that do IPO underwritings , " says Yves F. M. Hentic , one hedge-fund operator . " Often you don ' t need to buy anything to open an account , " he adds . Then keep in touch . In particular , individual investors should ask to be kept apprised of the firms ' new issues . A. T. Brod , the small New York brokerage firm , offered prospectuses to all its clients for Healthplex Inc. , which markets various medical services . The offering price in January was $5. 00 a unit , consisting of two shares and a warrant to buy another share at $3 through Jan. 16 , 1989 ; in 10 days it went to $8. 83 . Not many investors outside the firm ' s clientele were even aware of the issue . Investors who want to get into the issues that big institutional investors are interested in should open accounts with retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ' s difficult for an individual to get in the door at a Goldman , Sachs &; Co. or a Morgan Stanley &; Co. , because the big institutional firms don ' t welcome little investor accounts . But such institutional brokers look for brokers that do lots of business with the general public when they put together selling groups for their issues . Watching Prices Prices of the hottest new issues are often raised before they hit the street , and the number of shares to be offered can also be increased . For instance , the initial market capitalization ( price times shares ) for Home Shopping Network turned out to be 86% higher than estimated in the original filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Conversely , the market price of Syntro Corp. , an initial offering brought out by Merrill Lynch in July during the hoopla about Home Shopping , was reduced more than 50% at issue from original estimates . Six weeks after it hit the market , Syntro , which develops vaccines for animals , had dropped 48% to $4. 125 a share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t generally public until after the fact . But it ' s the sort of thing a good broker can find out from the underwriter , or can be determined by an investor who has developed market contacts . Studying Underwriters Because each underwriter has its own techniques for pricing deals and its style of marketing them , the identity of the underwriter is a solid clue to what a new issue might do when it starts trading . Despite Syntro , Merrill Lynch ranked third in after-market performance of initial offerings brought to market in the first half of this year ; prices rose for 13 of its 19 offerings . In contrast , none of Rotan Mosle Inc. ' s three underwritings went up , and only three of PaineWebber Group Inc. ' s 10 offerings rose . Timing Individuals who decide to invest after a new issue starts trading in the secondary market should understand that the prices of hot issues  --  and lukewarm ones , too  --  follow a typical pattern . From the first day of trading prices tend to rise for a month or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop . Prices of most new issues a year after the offering are close to the initial price , making that one reasonable time to buy the stock . Investors interested in a quick profit must buy as close as possible to the issue date . All too often individual investors only hear about new issues near the peak ; then they buy and are left holding the bag . Avoid stocks that have jumped 50% or more in price in the first few days . Such issues become a target of short sellers , who sell borrowed shares on a bet that they can buy back the stock later at a much reduced price . The short sellers ' activity slows or freezes the stock ' s price climb and can reverse it . That ' s what happened with L.A. Gear Inc. , which makes athletic shoes . Its shares leaped from $11. 50 to $23. 75 in the first few days , only to fall back to $16 over the next six weeks . Investors who bought in the secondary market lost money . Home Shopping was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening day fueled investor interest and the stock price continued its upward climb . Professionals say the best way to spot an issue that will heat up as the first month of trading progresses is to look for issues that jump by 10% to 20% in the first few days . Such a rise suggests strong investor interest but is rarely enough to attract short sellers . An example : Flores de New Mexico Inc. went from $6 to $7 the first day of trading  --  a 17% increase  --  and steadily climbed to $16. 125 , up 169% , in the following month . The company has an arrangement with the University of New Mexico to produce roses commercially . Doing Homework Even though individual investors have difficulty getting in at the start they are well advised to research new issues before they are offered , watch them trade for a few days and be ready to pounce . But sitting down and calculating all the ratios that a studious investor would normally use to evaluate an established business may not do much good . " I ' ve seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fundamentals do well , " says F. N. Wolf , who heads a small New York brokerage firm bearing his name . One with good fundamentals that has done well is Officeland Inc. , which Wolf brought out last January at $3. 50 a share . After a few weeks , it had only edged up to $4 . Then several institutional funds apparently read the prospectus and did some research . The company had solid operations , as well as a lock on the business of auctioning secondhand , reconditioned office machines in Canada under contract to Citibank . The price rose to $7 by July , vaulting Wolf into the top-ranked position among brokerage houses for after-market performance in the first six months of this year , according to Going Public : The IPO Reporter . Looking at certain characteristics may help predict whether the price will go up or down  --  though not by how much . Larry Oakley , editor of New Issue Alert newsletter in Boca Raton , Fla. , has a scale for rating new issues that he claims is 85% effective in predicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points if the company ' s chief executive officer isn ' t full time ; and he deducts even more points if the company plans to use the proceeds of the underwriting to repay debt rather than expand . Nevertheless , while companies with good fundamentals may ultimately make good investments , investing in initial public offerings is a short-term game . Underwriters expect 85% of the shares of a new issue to turn over in the first month . To succeed , investors have got to be able to spot not just issues that will go up , but the ones that will be really hot . And that requires knowing what the major players are doing . " If you ' re interested in short-term profits , the underwriting grapevine will dictate how an issue performs , " says Norman Fosback , editor of New Issues , a newsletter based in Ft . Lauderdale , Fla . " If your primary interest is longer-term performance , research on the fundamentals is a far more important consideration.
