" Washington , D.C. , has the best characters in the world , " bubbles Goldie Hawn , 38 , who was filming Protocol in the capital , where she also grew up . Goldie plays a cocktail waitress who through a hilarious ( it says here ) series of events becomes a State Department protocol officer . Not amused , however , was the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee . Some extras who answered a casting call for " Arab-looking " types started a protest after seeing the script , which satirizes the kaffiyeh-clad emissaries of a mythical Middle Eastern kingdom . Worry about adverse publicity led Executive Producer Hawn and the film 's other bosses to agree to consider eliminating some of the more offensive material . Is n't that what protocol is all about ? <P> This cowboy was born Issur Danielovitch in upstate New York . His parents were from Russia . And , he says , " I never rode a horse unless they paid me . " But in America , anything is possible . So to honor his work in such films as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonely Are the Brave , the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City inducted Kirk Douglas , 67 , as its newest celluloid cowpoke , joining the legendary likes of John Wayne . The Duke might have been amused . After Douglas portrayed the eccentric painter Vincent Van Gogh . Wayne asked him , " Why did you play that weak , sniveling character ? " Replied Douglas : " I 'm an actor . " Warned the Duke : " Yeah , well , do n't let me catch you playing a role like that again . " <P> Their repertory includes such come-again classics as Big Bottom , Intravenus de Milo and The Sun Never Sweats . Until recently , the only way a fan could hear them was by buying a ticket to This Is Spinal Tap , a mock rockumentary that chronicles the exploits of a fictitious heavy-metal band . The group called Spinal Tap was only a joke , created for the film by Director Rob ( All in the Family ) Reiner , 39 , and its three main members , played by Writer-Comedians Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael McKean , 36 . The movie has been such a stomping success , however , that the boys have decided to take their act on the real rock road . They appeared on Saturday Night Live last week . Is the band surprised to find life imitating art ? " Not really , " explains Shearer . " After all , our antics are n't stranger than anyone else 's . " <P> " Here 's to the substance beneath the surface . To the true color of the spirit rather than the color of the package . " A noble sentiment , certainly . But when the speaker is Joan Collins , 50 , one can not help wondering : Is her television alter ego , Alexis Carrington , merely engaging once again in deceitful discourse for the sake of her own naughty ends ? Not this time . The scene is from Blondes vs Brunettes , an ABC-TV special to be aired next week , which features TV 's brunet queen meanie , Collins , and Morgan Fairchild , 34 , a blond TV vixen . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other over tea . Amid the treacle , it is reassuring to remember that the two femmes fatales still have plenty of that good old delicious malicious left in them . <P> - By Guy D. Garcia
