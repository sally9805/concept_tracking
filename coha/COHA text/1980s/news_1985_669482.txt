This salesman , who didn ' t look so ancient himself , had helped bolt together That Amazing Phantasm . I mean , of course , the very thing , the New York ' 64 World ' s Fair , where public telephones had push-button dialing long before my town did , where the telephones had video screens , and a rocket-propelled backpack allowed a man to fly free of airplanes . Not to mention the moving sidewalks that reduced strolling to an exercise of the past . Though I made only two day-trips to the fair , it was an immense preoccupation while I was nine and ten years old and , particularly now that I live in New York , I can ' t figure out why so few seem to care about it . An indifferent grunt is apt to answer my peeping query , ' ' Do you remember the ' 64 World ' s Fair ? ' ' Then I ask , ' ' But couldn ' t you see in it what I saw ? ' ' // // In ' 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me : round towers , strange and exciting super-modern grayish-white pavilions , the Swiss skyride cruising above . My Instamatic 100 took it all in , and even today I could show you my shots of the giant plastic dinosaurs and the Goodyear Tire Ferris wheel . The World ' s Fair was , I thought , the bright vision of my space-age future , an adulthood in an aerial community such as the cartoon Jetsons , where I would program my car for its destination and drive on cruise-control while watching TV . Yes , I was being cradled by a generation of benevolent industrial scientists for a lifestyle so convenient that it was almost magical . I knew it could be , just as I argued that robots like Astroboy did indeed exist , and it would come about maybe by 1972. // Toward the arrival of this vision I aimed to do my bit , and became something of a junior scientist , in self-training to join the older ones who made the World ' s Fair happen . I experimented with a kiddie chemistry set and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several weeks I tried to make stalactites and stalagmites by dripping a chemical down pieces // of string hanging in a shoe box . I built a weather station with an anemometer of suspended paper cups and a barometer utilizing human hair , and twice succeeded in predicting rain . How was anyone to know that I wouldn ' t make a tremendous discovery in the dining room where I assembled my equipment ? Or that the helicopter I tried to build in the garage wouldn ' t take to the skies ? And that these would not move the world closer to a World ' s Fair-like place where a house , I think it could have been in the Japanese pavilion , possessed a backyard full of water over colored stones instead of grass , criss-crossed by raised walkways ? // I have never forgotten the World ' s Fair . It reappeared one gray morning in 1975 as I rode in the back seat of a car returning to my dormitory room in Philadelphia from a New Year ' s party on Long Island . I scanned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was there : the Unisphere , that very Unisphere . It gracefully loomed over the Queens apartment buildings , an image I still find beautiful . Yes , that was it . ( I screamed. ) // I ' m thinking of visiting the site of the ' 64 World ' s Fair this weekend . Someone told me it ' s pretty run down , with a lot of rust . Will I see some of the old pavilions , maybe footprints where those plastic dinosaurs stood ? Are there particles of paint , like police markings at the scene of a crime , pinpointing the old skyride depot and General Motors ' labyrinth of moving history ? // Perhaps you knew . I didn ' t and I ' m not necessarily glad that I ' ve learned . I mean , some birds have roosted in the bottom of the Unisphere . The nest rests somewhere in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and has sprouted a well-fertilized vine-like plant that hangs through a space in the steel girders . It results from neglect , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that doves ( it could have been starlings but it also could have been doves ) should make their home in a structure dedicated to world peace . The Unisphere ' s bright fountains are dormant , and youths hold a party on the graffitied base , across an expanse of pipes. // As we walked through the gates on Saturday afternoon , my friend said , ' ' Ah ! It looks like Disneyland 100 years from now ! ' ' Or , you know , as in the ' ' Planet of the Apes , ' ' when the disembodied arm of the Statue of Liberty jets spectacularly out of the sandy beach . The property is a time warp created by an ultrahigh density of reminders of the past , from the blue and orange paint of the No. 7 train station to the living-room-sized elevator , meant to haul vast numbers of visitors , at the Queens Museum. // Boulevards , lined with trees and benches for resting in the heat of the day , lead nowhere in particular . Large unexplained open spaces , like certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovers eerily near. // After so much crazy thinking about the World ' s Fair and , one must admit , a certain disappointment , I feel I am entitled to experience a short supernatural communication with that singular event . Although nothing of the sort has happened to me before , I stroll down a boulevard imagining that I may glimpse a lingering photo-image of pavilions over the well-worn grass , or hear the chaotic voices of a million visitors . But , in the hot bright afternoon , I see only picnickers and soccer players and hear only the rattling of leaves. // I think about time and how I didn ' t know at nine that I would come back at 30 to find the World ' s Fair still there , but three-quarters vacant . I try to figure out the exact spot where I stood to point my camera - click ! - to get that **31;45770;TOOLONG shot of the globe. // It was right here , somewhere , perhaps quite close , that I alighted on the edge of the Unisphere 21 years ago to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy , and to revel in the prospect of my future. // // // // //
