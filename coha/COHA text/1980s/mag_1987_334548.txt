On the 49th day after death , according to Buddhist teaching , the souls of the dead make their journey into the next world . So it was last week that on the appointed day several thousand students gathered in the streets of Seoul to mark the final passage of Park Jong Chul , a 21-year-old student who had died during a police interrogation . What followed was more like a descent into hell . <P> The students , joined by an assortment of sympathizers , were met by an overwhelming onslaught of force and fury . Some 10,000 shield-bearing policemen , armored in riot helmets , blocked major street corners . As the students marched in remembrance of their slain comrade , the police fired tear- gas grenades into their midst . Thick clouds of blinding fumes soon routed the protesters , sending them gasping and reeling . One band of Buddhist monks were gassed and shoved as they tried to enter their temple . Chanted several gray- robed monks as they were driven back : " Restore democracy ! Overthrow the dictatorship ! " <P> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent months , and more often than not it has been uttered by the country 's students , especially the radical hard-liners . On every side , demands are growing that President Chun Doo Hwan reform a regime that , while not nearly as repressive as Communist North Korea 's , stifles dissent and tortures and imprisons political opponents . In frequent demonstrations , university students have demanded an end to dictatorship when Chun , a former general who seized power in 1980 , fulfills a pledge to step down next February . The students ' aim is nothing less than to bring what they consider democracy to a country that is rapidly becoming an economic power while remaining politically mired in the autocratic traditions of a 5,000-year-old society . <P> The students , who began a new school term last week , have attracted intense scrutiny by Washington and other capitals . With a 40,000-troop garrison in South Korea , the U.S. views that countryas a key Pacific ally and a bulwark against the Soviet-backed North Korean government . Washington was thus taken aback last year , when North Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned sharply anti-American . The U.S. has since urged Chun to help defuse the situation by compromising with the opposition on a formula for the transition to democracy . Secretary of State George Shultz , who visited Seoul last week during a ten-day Far East swing , reportedly received assurances that Chun would seek such a compromise . Said a senior U.S. diplomat : " We believe this is a historic opportunity , and both Chun and the opposition have got to take it . " A breakthrough will be difficult to achieve , however , because the country has little tradition of political accommodation . <P> The students and Chun today seem to be on a collision course . The protesters are clear about what they want . " Most Koreans , whether students or not , favor a return to civilian government , " says a former council president at Seoul National University who was jailed for 1 1/2 years for organizing a reading circle . " We want to see a change in the constitution and direct election of a President . This is the most important thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
