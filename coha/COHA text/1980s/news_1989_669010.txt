You ' d think Bruscha Williams would never have to worry about making a name for himself . The Thornwood sprinter , whose first name is pronounced Brew-shay , transferred to the South Holland school from Jackson , Miss. , last fall and has been a most welcome addition to coach Gary Haupert ' s team . Williams , a senior , has been one of the top sprinters in the Chicago area this spring . But Williams has had to prove himself all over again after being a star at Provine High School in Jackson . At the Mississippi state meet , he finished second in the 400 meters and third in the 100 , and ran a leg on the winning 1 , 600-meter relay . But Williams had to show his teammates what he could do on the track . " When I got here , to be frank , a lot of people didn ' t believe I could do anything , " Williams said . " In track , they didn ' t believe I could run-the same with football . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried not to boast and just did what I had to do . " What Williams has done is run the 400 in 48. 74 seconds and the 100 meters in 10. 58 . He has to be considered , along with Thornton ' s Joe Spells , York ' s Ron Westphal and Proviso East ' s Byron Moss , a contender for the Class AA state title in the 400 . Now Williams , who also played running back on the Thornwood football team , has made a name for himself on and off the track . His first name came to his mother while she was walking in a field in Mendenhall , Miss. , 10 years before Bruscha was born . His cousin Anthony was nicknamed Bruscha until Williams was born . " I like it , " said Williams , whose middle names are Lovetho Heavente . " People don ' t get you mixed up with everybody . " Williams moved to South Holland to live with his father after spending most of his life in Mississippi with his mother . His parents divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " In the South , there are some very great teams , but I knew there was more to life than that . " Sportswise and academicwise , the North has a very good school system compared to the South . The South is not that strong . When I got to Thornwood , I realized there were a lot of advantages here . I really wished I could have been here my freshman year . I think I would have been better off athleticwise and everything else . " Living with his father , John Williams , has proved to be an adjustment . Bruscha admits he could pretty much do what he wanted to do in Mississippi . That has not been the case in South Holland . " My Dad is strict , " said Williams , who has a B average at Thornwood . " Here , my father is like the warden and I love him for it . If I had stayed in the South , I don ' t think I would have had the opportunities I have now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete in indoor track . In Mississippi , the outdoor season started in March and the first meet was two weeks later . The indoor season at Thornwood , which started Feb. 15 , gave Williams a chance to build strength and get into running shape . Running indoors was a new experience , with its tight turns on narrow 160-meter tracks . Williams was eager to learn , and he ran everything from the 60 to the 600 . The indoor season , plus a conditioning class taught by Haupert , has put Williams in good shape for the homestretch of the season . " The indoor season was very strange to me , " he said . " It wasn ' t easy at first and I had to learn by watching everybody run . The more I caught on , the more I liked it . I have to admit it helped me . " Williams and Haupert aren ' t sure what events he ' ll run in the state series . The 400 is probably his best event , but the 100 and 200 are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing a nagging leg injury , is open to suggestions . " He accepts coaching real well , " Haupert said . " He ' s a likeable kid who ' s easy to coach . He ' ll do what you tell him to do . " He ' s really helped us out . I remember when he walked out on the football field with his dad the first day of football . Sometimes a father will get carried away with how good his son is . This one was for real . He wasn ' t kidding. "
