The fall is when spring bulb budgets must be done and done . As usual , my first draft runs to extravagant cash outlays for the two bulb majors  --  tulips and daffodils  --  and needs trimming . ( Not easy . I suffer from the modern form of that 16th-century affliction , Tulipomania , also Narcissomania and several other Miscellaneous Manias having to do with the lesser or " Miscellaneous Bulbs . " ) Right now , I am troweling up for my second-round cuts , relying on the Wall Street firm of John Scheepers , " Flower Bulb Specialists , " to get me through the Bulb Budgeting Process . Scheepers has been Wall Street ' s bulb broker for 75 years , and mine for two . This Stock Market garden center ' s catalog  --  " Beauty From Bulbs "  --  gives the equivalent of free Bulb Tutorials , or rather , Hortutorials . Over the past several seasons , Scheepers ' s investment counselors have included Wordsworth ( " He is happiest who hath power/To gather wisdom from a flower " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Abraham Lincoln ( " I always plucked a thistle and planted a flower , where I thought a flower would grow . " ) After seven years of minding my own plot , I admit that I do not want for bulbs . Still , I want bulbs . The ones I have are old , and while the daffodils have been naturalizing themselves narcissistic , the tulips have been running themselves down . Besides , I have not had any sort of Bloom-Stretching Strategy . Most of my old bulbs are fixed to effloresce in earliest primavera , only . Furthermore , I am an easy mark for new flower models  --  the two-toned tulips whereon one color is splashed , feathered , flamed , flushed , brushed , crested or otherwise commixed with another . Most of my cutbacks turn into givebacks after studying Scheepers . In the tulip line I find myself short on : Triumph , Double Late-Flowering , Majestic , Cottage , Fringed , Fosteriana , Kaufmanniana and Greigii . I do not own such classics as Keizerskroon , " introduced in 1750 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutchlish , I learn " the stem is strong and very capable to carry upright this brilliant flower , " nor do I have " these amazing Tulips " yclept Gudoshnik , nor the founder ' s wife , Mrs. John T. Scheepers ( " claimed by all experts to be the very best yellow garden Tulip in existence today " ) , nor pink Clara Butt , nor Black Pearl , which " can be called just black , " or the " tough substance " of Burgundy Lace . ( In Scheeperspeak , Tulip has a capital T and Daffodil a capital D. ) Introducing the Daffodils , Scheepers invokes Will Shakespeare : " Before the storm and sleet are past/Laugh out the Daffodils . " Browsing Scheepers ' laugh-out pages , I find a " Class A. All yellow " named Joseph MacLeod that is " upward facing showing its beauty from a right angle "  --  which might just be the neatest trick of the spring . For the sake of daffodillic geography I would like the " exquisite new Class B. Bi-color " Oklahoma , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all respects " Jersey Beauty . Then there is Edward Buxton , a " shortcup narcissus " who is " an exceptional naturalizer , " to say nothing of the " undaffodil-like " double narcissus , Flowerdrift , that " gives an impression of weightlessness , drifting in the air . " I also covet from the " Cyclamineus Hybrids , " Peeping Tom , and from the " Jonquilla Hybrids , " Suzy , the " bright bi-color " and Trevithian with " a lovely cluster of flowers in every way , born gracefully , " and certainly some " Poeticus Narcissi "  --  " grown in the Middle Ages . . . can still be found abundantly around old castles in Europe "  --  the like of Old Pheasant ' s Eye , " the latest Poeticus " to flower . And I have no immunity against " The Lure of the Little Daffodils , " that is , " certain wild species of small stature that are all too seldom seen in gardens , " such as the " hoop petticoat form " of Bulbocodium Conspicuus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " deep yellow trumpet is straight and narrow . " Nor , naturally , am I about to pass up an option on Evolution , listed among the " Prehistoric Daffodils " that are " claimed by experts to be the original form of the Daffodil . " Admittedly , there is nothing quite so homely as a double-nosed Daffodil bulb in its plain , brown wrapper , unless it ' s a single-nosed Tulip bulb . Yet these seemingly dull fall bulbs are the pre-packaged makings of the Big Spring Scene and the thing to be done immediately is to finish filling out the order form  --  and the border  --  with the " Miscellaneous Bulbs " : the Dickensian crocuses , Pickwick and Little Dorrit , the Grecian Wind Flower ( anemone blanda ) , snowdrops , fritillarias , and the scilla/squills in the interest of " Permanent Effects . " No temporary plantstrokes here . The gardener is assured by the Scheepers volk that whatever is done will be " expressive of perfect harmony and good taste . " ( This spring they put Balzac on the counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for flowers denotes a beautiful character which almost all persons of true refinement have . " ) In fact , in the course of refining my Bulb Budget I have added Scheepers ' s Bulb Food , a nutritional supplement for Ts , Ds , and Misc. , bagged in 5-lb. ( " good for approximately 250 bulbs " ) and 25-lb. ( " 1 , 250 bulbs " ) allotments  --  implanted one tsp. per bulb  --  because the firm promises that this bulb fodder will be " a very happy investment . " The Fall 1986 " Beauty From Bulbs " closes with a one-page advisory on " Utilizing the Nooks and Corners " in order to " bring about charming spring pictures " in " places that at the present time are giving no good account of themselves at all , " such as " the Dull Border on the North Side of the House " ( Scillas , Snowdrops , Winter Aconites , Leucojums , Narcissi ) , " Tucked in About the Sundial or Bird Bath " ( " all kinds of miscellaneous bulbs " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Narcissi and Lilies ) . My bulb budget collapses before Scheepers ' s reasoning : " It is a great pity not to make use of them in the interests of spring delight .
