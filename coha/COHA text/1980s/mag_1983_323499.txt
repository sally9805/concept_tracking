Newswatch <P> In his new autobiography , Laurence Olivier remarks that bitchiness can be a " journalist 's handiest tool . " Perhaps Lord Olivier was thinking mostly of Britain , where the gift for malice , and the appetite for it , is higher than here . An English playwright , Arnold Wesker , once wrote The Journalists , a drama about " the poisonous human need to cut better men down to our size . . . The lilliputian journalist be the interviewee 's fame , influence or achievement . " That too may be more true in Britain . <P> In the U.S. , however , there is the interview known as a hatchet job : a familiar hazard show business that was extended in the 1960s to politics by the New Journalists . Among its techniques are posing embarrassing questions either to get an offguard answer or , failing that , to describe the subject 's evasive tics and mannerisms . Hatchet jobs survive , among other places , in the Style section of the Washington Post , whose good cultural coverage and criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever . ( In its year-end listing of what is In and Out , the Post proclaims 1983 as the year " when it is really Out to be In , " which rendered pointless the whole silly exercise . ) <P> The anatomy of a Post hatchet job can be studied profitably in the paper 's recent treatment of Willie Morris , who as editor of Harper 's magazine in the 1960s demolition , invited in the New Journalists . To make a target worthy of demolition , first praise him . Reporter James Conaway speaks of Morris ' " extraordinary autobiography , North Toward Home , " and of his editorship that " many people think was Harper 's finest time . " But that was years ago ; Conaway now finds Morris living in Oxford , Miss. , the home town of William Faulkner . At 48 , Morris is " drinking bourbon by the fire " in the house of Faulkner 's niece . He has , Conaway observes , " grown broad of beam , " sitting there with his dog Pete , " a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Conaway sketches in the intervening years : at Harper 's , " his stewardship foundered in 1971 , " so Morris went off " to dwell on the cusp of his own notoriety . " His books since are quickly disposed of : one is " a disappointment to his admirers " ; another a critic had called " derivative drivel " ; a third " did nothing to enhance Morris ' reputation . " <P> But Faulkner 's niece Dean Wells and her husband Larry admire Willie Morris . Morris had wanted to come back to Mississippi , no longer felt at home in his native Yazoo City , Miss. , and wanted to teach at Ole Miss . It was Larry Wells who made this possible , rounding up extra money from businessmen around the state so that the university 's English department could afford to take on Morris as writer-in-residence . He had even wheedled $5,000 out of the Ole Miss journalism department .
