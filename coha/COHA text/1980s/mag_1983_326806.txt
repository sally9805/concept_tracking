Two U.S. bounty hunters stir an international legal battle <P> In the Old West , when a sheriff could afford to ride only so far from town in pursuit of a criminal , bounty hunters acted as de facto freelance deputies , collecting rewards for bringing back fugitives . Times have changed , but the bounty hunter survives , working now for bail-bond companies eager to capture bail jumpers . True to tradition , local authorities still ask few questions about the methods used in returning a suspect to their jurisdiction . <P> Foreign governments , however , can prove more sensitive . For months now , Canada and the state of Florida have been locked in a legal battle sparked by two American bounty hunters who nabbed a Canadian millionaire wanted for jumping bail in Florida . Last week the international dispute grew so hot that Secretary of State George Shultz and Attorney General William French Smith took the unusual step of asking Florida authorities to back down . <P> The trouble started in May 1981 , when Sidney Jaffe , a prominent Toronto land developer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , Fla. ; the charges involved criminal violations of the state 's Uniform Land Sales Practices Law by a Florida real estate firm Jaffe owned . Faced with the loss of $137,000 it had posted in bail , the Accredited Surety &; Casualty Co. decided not to wait for a formal extradition request and instead sent Timm Johnsen and Daniel Kear to Toronto to bring Jaffe back . Like most modern-day bounty hunters , Johnsen and Kear figured they would earn 10% of the bond , in this case $13,700 , plus expenses and a bonus . <P> The capture was quick and dirty , so Jaffe claims . He was returning to his condominium from an afternoon jog when he was lured into a car , handcuffed and then taken south to the U.S. border at Niagara Falls . " This is a gotcha , " Johnsen allegedly told Jaffe , who contends that the bounty hunters beat him . Local police , alerted by Jaffe 's daughter , refused to intervene when he appealed to them at the Niagara Falls International Airport . Kear and Johnsen took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Convicted in Putnam County on 28 counts of land-sale irregularities , plus one count of failing to appear for his trial , Jaffe , now 58 , was sentenced to 35 years . Florida legal observers were astonished at the severity of his sentence , especially since no one else has ever been charged under the 1963 state statute . <P> The Canadian government was less astonished than infuriated . More than any other nation , it has been scrupulously cooperative in complying with U.S. requests for the extradition of fugitives . Florida 's failure to file the forms and cowboy-style tactics hardly seemed justified . Under a 1971 U.S.-Canada treaty , Florida Governor Robert Graham could have requested Jaffe 's extradition . But Putnam County State Attorney Stephen Boyles never provided the Governor with the necessary documentation .
