The outpost is the International Medical Research Center , which was built a decade ago at a cost of $30 million and which recently shifted its research attention from other sexually transmitted diseases to acquired immune deficiency syndrome. // In July , the center is expected to complete construction of a $1. 4 million laboratory whose stringent containment standards will allow three teams of virologists to work simultaneously on AIDS-causing viruses without fear of contamination , according to Georges E. Roelants , a Belgian microbiologist who is scientific director of the center . <> <> International Seminar // In April , the center is to sponsor the International Seminar on Retroviral Infections in Intertropical Africa - the first AIDS conference in Gabon , which is an anomaly in Central Africa because of its low rates of AIDS infection . Scientists from France , the United States and 22 African countries are expected to attend. // A major topic will be the two new virus discoveries , accounts of which are to be published shortly in scientific journals. // The human variant , called HIV-1 oyi , was identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabonese . The simian variant , SIV mand , was identified last year from blood samples from two mandrills. // The human variant is a substrain of HIV-1 , the main human immunodeficiency virus causing AIDS in Africa and virtually all cases in North America , Europe and elsewhere . Variants such as the one found here show small differences in genetic makeup . An entirely separate but related virus , HIV-2 , has been discovered in humans in West Africa ; scientists believe it sometimes causes disease but they are not yet sure whether it is as virulent as HIV-1 . <> <> Caution on Discovery // All other previously known strains of HIV-1 can cause disease in their human hosts . But so far , the three Gabonese in which the new variant was found show no signs of AIDS. // Scientists here caution that it is too early to tell if HIV-1 oyi - the name is derived from the initials of the first patient in which it was discovered - is a benign variant of the main AIDS virus. // " If HIV-1 oyi is benign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to identify what gene , what protein part is responsible for making the viruses pathogenic , " said Dr. Roelants . " If you have that , then you can start thinking in terms of pharmacology - an AIDS drug. " // Last year , scientists here and in Paris cultured three HIV-1 oyi viruses in blood samples taken from 20 Gabonese . Simon Wayne-Hobson , a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris , identified the virus variant last summer . <> <> Primate Blood Bank // The monkey virus variant was identified from samples taken last year for a blood bank maintained by the center ' s Primatology Division since 1981 . At the installation , which is believed to be the world ' s largest blood bank for primates , the center stores blood samples taken every four weeks from a population of 259 captive primates - largely chimpanzees , mandrills , lowland gorillas and long-tailed macaques. // Last year , the new monkey variant was identified by two Japanese virologists , M. Hayami and H. Tsujimoto , at the Institute of Medical Science at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses were known : SIV macaque , SIV African green monkey and SIV sooty mangabey monkey . These viruses , which apparently do not infect humans , are related to the human AIDS viruses . Scientists hope that by studying how these viruses function in monkeys they can draw lessons about the human disease . <> <> Studying Molecular Makeup // " The Japanese hope to see what is different in the molecular makeup in the viruses , " said Robert W. Cooper , an American veterinarian who is director of the Primatology Division. // The international character of the research here is in keeping with the mission of the 100-acre installation set in a rolling savanna overlooking the upper reaches of the Ogooue River. // The center ' s construction a decade ago was funded by Elf Gabon , the French-Gabonese oil company , and its annual $8-million budget is paid by the company and the Government of Gabon , which is the smallest African member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. // " The idea of CIRMF is to bring modern technology to Africa , " Dr. Roelants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The center employs 165 people - 25 foreigners and 140 Gabonese - and maintains close supply and communications links with the northern hemisphere . <> <> Shift in Focus to AIDS // " We have a purchasing office in Paris , " said Eric Delaporte , a French virologist who directs the center ' s AIDS virus research . " Supplies leave Paris Wednesday evening and arrive here Thursday evening. " // When the center opened in 1979 , its primary focus was the study of the connection between sexually transmitted diseases and what scientists call Africa ' s " infertility belt " - Gabon , southern Cameroon and northern Congo. // Researchers here found that a chlamydia epidemic is a major cause of a relatively low fertility rate in this nation of 900 , 000 . Gabon ' s rate of 3. 2 children per woman is well below sub-Saharan Africa ' s average of six children per woman. // Surveys indicate that 10 to 15 percent of pregnant Gabonese women are infected with chlamydia . One study found that chlamydia was the cause of sterility for 76 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outbreak of the AIDS epidemic in neighboring Central African countries , work at the center is shifting toward AIDS virus research . <> <> Relatively Low AIDS Rates // For now , Gabon has been spared the high rates of AIDS virus contamination found in neighboring Central African states. // The nearby countries of Zaire , Congo and the Central African Republic report that about 5 percent of their urban populations are infected with the main AIDS virus. // Surveys in Gabon have found an infection rate of 1. 8 percent in Libreville , the capital , 0. 5 percent in Port-Gentil , the second-largest city , and . 25 percent in the countryside around here. // " We don ' t understand why the rates are so low , because we are so close to Congo and Zaire , " said D. D. Benoni , a virologist studying the HIV-1 virus at Omar Bongo University in Libreville. // Some scientists here speculate that the thick jungle covering most of Gabon has blocked population movement from infected zones in the south and east . <> <> Prevention Campaign // Due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capita income in sub-Saharan Africa - $3 , 900 . Immigration is tightly controlled . Traditionally , most immigrants here have come from the north - Benin , Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea . These countries also have low AIDS rates. // Although there have only been 17 known cases of AIDS in Gabon , the Government has started a prevention campaign. // " AIDS is a serious disease and we are aware of it , " Gabon ' s President , Omar Bongo , said in an interview . " The survey results are comforting . But we are very vigilant because we know the virus is spreading. " // Scientists here fear that Gabon is ripe for an epidemic of the AIDS-causing virus , which is spread in Africa largely through heterosexual sex. // Surveys indicate that 19 percent of adults in Libreville and 13 percent of adults in Franceville suffer from untreated cases of syphilis . Scientists suspect that untreated sores from venereal disease can speed the transmission of AIDS . <> <> Testing Blood for Transfusions // To head off an epidemic , Gabon last November began testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are now test centers in the three-largest cities - Libreville , Port-Gentil and Franceville. // " I have one and a half tons of information booklets to distribute , " Gabon ' s Health Minister , Jean-Pierre Okias , said before leaving last month for a health ministers ' conference in London that focused on AIDS. // At the hilltop research center here , scientists have embarked on a four-year , $400 , 000-a-year project to study the new human AIDS variant . One goal is see if HIV-1 oyi offers protection against known pathogenic HIV-1 viruses. // " Pathogenicity is still a question mark , " Dr. Delaporte said of HIV-1 oyi . " This is one more building block for our understanding of the HIV retroviruses. " //
