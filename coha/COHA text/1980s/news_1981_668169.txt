It was a shame it didn ' t count . It was about the only artistic play of a game marred by 43 turnovers . Boston College ' s John Bagley took the ball at halfcourt with less than five seconds to play and the Eagles trailing by two , spun out of a Georgetown double team and launched a 30-footer under pressure . The shot rattled home . But the referee , Art Mellace , ruled that Bagley did not release the ball until after the buzzer and thus made official BC ' s second loss of the season , a 57-55 defeat at Georgetown ' s McDonough Arena last night . " It doesn ' t do any good to belabor the fact , " said Eagle coach Tom Davis . " I don ' t really know . I thought it was extremely close and could have gone either way . Our fans thought it was good , and I ' m sure the people of Georgetown didn ' t even think it was close . " John Thompson , Georgetown ' s coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t even close . The only thing I was worried about was the buzzer getting lost in the crowd noise . You ' re always worried about something like this , but I saw the referee give the signal before the ball left his hands . " Bagley ' s post-buzzer shot was made possible by Georgetown ' s Ed Spriggs . The Hoya center missed the front end of a one-and-one with five seconds to go . The referee ' s decision to disallow the bucket ended the Eagles ' winning streak at five and gave them two losses in the Big East . It also negated a last-minute comeback . Leading , 47-44 , with just under 10 minutes to play , Georgetown ran off six unanswered points to go up by seven with less than 6:30 remaining . But Eagle freshman center Jay Murphy scored back-to-back baskets that cut the Hoya lead to 55-50 with only five minutes remaining . Then it was Dwan Chandler ' s turn .

The Eagles had problems dissecting the Georgetown 2-3 zone , and with less than 10 seconds remaining , Bagley penetrated into traffic and had the ball slapped away . " We weren ' t trying to hold the ball for a last shot , " said Davis . " The whole time , we were looking for a good shot , but Georgetown ( 8- 6 ) was playing a tough zone . They shut us down , and that was to their credit . They ' re a nice team . " But I ' m real proud of this team . We did remarkably well ( 5-2 ) on this road trip . " Regardless of the outcome , Bagley established himself as one of the premier guards in the Big East .
