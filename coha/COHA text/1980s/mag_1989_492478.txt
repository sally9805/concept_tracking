Dr. Samuel Broder , director of the National Cancer Institute , pulls no punches when he updates SatEvePost readers on the good and bad news of cancer prevention , research , and treatment . In this , the second half of our two-part series , Dr. Broder discusses new options for breast cancer victims , explains the patient 's role in choosing among possible treatments , and predicts the future management of colon cancer . With the current push for more AIDS research , this portion of the interview begins on the hot topic of funding . Specifically : Dr. SerVaas : What do you say when you see editorials about how AIDS research might be taking money away from cancer research ? Dr. Broder : The Cancer Institute is not the dominant lead institute or agency on AIDS . That is the National Institute of Allergy &; Infectious Diseases , the operation which Dr. Anthony Fauci heads , but we do have a specialized role in vaccine and new drug development . We 're very proud of our role in that , and I think we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I think we have something to offer . We will continue to make a major commitment to AIDS , but the primary mission of the Cancer Institute always has been and always will be cancer . Dr. S : What is the good news and the bad news about cancer ? Dr. B : I think that in both basic research and prevention , in early diagnosis and treatment , in all of those areas there 's been a lot of progress . But there 's also bad news , and Ithink that that 's something people have to come to terms with . The bad news is that we do not have a unifying molecular explanation for cancer . We do not have a cure for all cancers in an advanced state . And , in fact , for some cancers we really do not have effective treatment of any kind . This is the badnews , but my job is to tell you the truth . If you want to talk on the treatment area , the good news is that in very young people we have astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are also reducing the annual death rate for cancers in people under 65 . Now the advantage of that is that in curing people who have leukemia , certain lymphomas , testicular cancer , and certain gynecological conditions , you do an enormous amount of good because curing somebody who 's 22 years old allows ( them ' a lifetime of productivity . That 's very important . Dr. S : Could you give us an update on therapy progress with other cancers ? Dr. B : We 're making progress . If you look under age 65 in general , and if you exclude lung cancer , which is the very special disease that I 've talked to you about , because it 's being linked to smoking and is avoidable , we are making substantial progress in a number of cancers  --  how to treat them and how to prevent them . No question about it . So I would say there are many different advances . We are learning how to treat a lot of diseases better . I could regale you with the good news but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is something that the public has to hear . We do not have a cure for all cancer . We do not have a way of treating all cancers , and even when we have certain knowledge about some things , we sometimes still do n't have the ability to take it to heart . Smoking is the best example of that . Dr. S : Does the NCI have some programs we could tell our readers about  --  programs in which you do n't have enough patients participating where it might do some good to get the word out ? Dr. B : What I think would be good to stress is that we have cooperative groups . These are academic groups of physicians that have gotten together . These groups have important and interesting clinical trials , funded by the Cancer Institute , which try to offer new knowledge , but which also try to always test the best available therapy against something that people expect would be equal or better . I would urge individuals who develop a cancer to ask their doctors if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have the community clinical oncology program which works very closely with the cooperative groups . Physicians in the community  --  not academicians but community physicians  --  enroll patients in their practices and enter them into appropriate clinical trials . So if you wanted to suggest that to your readers , I think it would be a good thing . There 's something else that I would urge you to suggest to your readers . I think we 're in an era in which the patient and the doctor need to be in a dialogue about cancer treatment . The patients should view this as part of their responsibility . Dr. S : I wonder if our typical readers would dare dialogue with their oncologists or question their treatment . Dr. B : They should listen to me , they should read my lips , and they should understand that asking questions or defining things that affect their own health is not an inappropriate thing to do ; that a patient has to be a partner with the doctor . I do n't mean in technical matters  --  in a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have an understanding of what the options are , what the latest information is , and then he or she should participate in that process . Just as you have a role in helping your readers stop smoking , you should have a role in having them be participants . I think that the patient has to interact with the doctor , and has to play a role : it 's a definite role for the patients and their families . They need to know what the options are . All life is a matter of choices . The patient , in my opinion , should say , " First explain to me what I 've got . Then explain to me what the options are . " The question could be , " Is there more than one way of treating this ? " Then you can ask the doctor , " Well , what are the pros and cons from your point of view ? What are the benefits I 'm likely to get from each therapy ? What are the toxicities I 'm likely to get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's another specialist in the area who could give you a second opinion . ? Dr. How does a doctor ? view such participation ? Dr. B : I think that a doctor should never feel threatened . I 'm excluding emergency situations . On serious matters of health , I think that doctors should welcome a collegial relationship with other doctors and should welcome second opinions . Sometimes this can be very important . Many times an article will have just been published and maybe not be widely available or widely known . Sometimes the infor mation can be presented only in abstract form . That is , it 's only presented at a certain meeting and the patient still might benefit from that knowledge . We have a system with the AMA by which any doctor anywhere in the country can access all of our clinical trials information , including state-of-the-art information , where to go , what protocols and what the preliminary results are , with their own personal computer . We can work it so they could use their personal computer and in a very user-friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient might have and be able to ' , espond to that . We think that witt the prevalence of computers there will be thousands and thousands of doctors who have access to this system . Dr. S : And the fax machines . Dr. B : And there 'll be fax machines , but they do n't need it because this is an on-screen thing . We have a name for it . It 's called PDQ , for Physician Data Query . Basically , I do n't think it would be inappropriate in a setting of cancer for the patient to say , " Doctor , what did the PDQ print-out show for me ? " PDQ was developed by NCI , but we want to extend its use by cooperating with the AMA and other professional groups . The doctor might say , " What is PDQ ? " But there 's a point here that I want to stress for a minute . All of medicine is a continuous learning process , and patients need to understand that too . It is not a sign of weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jones , I want to have a day to review the latest findings on your problem . " People need to become accustomed to that . They need to hear that , and they need not to be threatened by that because that 's the way that the technology is . I think to me , if the doctor 's being sincere , that would be much more encouraging , provided he or she acted on that , than to have a doctor say , " I know everything about everything and I never have to look anything up . " Now , it is not a criticism of doctors  --  this is just a general thing that patients need to work into a dialogue and to accept responsibility for their own care . This is one theme that I have . In that specific sense , it 's a whole new consumerism , but that 's our mission here . We do not want to dictate or regulate doctors . That is not our responsibility . We want to generate knowledge , and the same taxpayers who pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will disseminate knowledge in a wide scheme . We are not afraid of knowledge . We feel that 's the thing that liberates everybody , and I think that patients slowly and surely , I hope , will come to terms with certain concepts that can help . One of them is that it 's O.K. to ask a series of questions . It 's O.K. to seek a second opinion . it 's O.K. for a doctor not to know everything , and a patient should not draw the wrong inference when a doctor says , " I do n't know ; I will check into it . " It could be they 'll check into it by looking into the PDQ system , which I think is a very effective one . Dr. S : Do n't you also have something like PDQ for the patient  --  it 's dial 800-4-CANCER ? Dr. B : We have that , yes . Dr. S : Is it effective ? Dr. B : Yes , that 's another technology . That 's also linked up so that patients can call with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we do not want to practice medicine via the telephone with a patient we have n't seen . Now , we have our own treatment unit here , so in that sense we will practice medicine . But we do n't want to substitute a telephone call as a way of practicing medicine . We do n't want to put ourselves in the middle of an ongoing doctor-patient relationship . The other thing that we try to do is we try to make a strong effort to respond to patients ' questions when they come up and to try on an individual basis to answer as much as we can . I have a great deal of faith in these computerized systems . I think we , in particular the practice of medicine , will be slowly but surely adapted so that people are used to the fact that medicine is a continuous , evolving discipline , and that 's a sign of health . Dr. S : Is there any news for a cancer vaccine ? Dr. B : I think it 's a research tool , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build an expectation for . I think there are many other exciting areas . I really feel , for example , that doctors are going to be managing breast cancer and colon cancer fundamentally different than they have in 4 the past . I think you 're going to see very significant changes in how women with breast cancer are handled . I think it should become very common practice for the average woman who gets breast cancer to go to a doctor and for the procedure not to stop with simply an operation and that 's it , but for an analysis to be done of what kind of estrogen receptors that woman has in her tumor , and for a decision then to be made that that woman will be offered hormonal therapy or certain types of chemotherapy , whether her nodes are positive or not . Even though there 's no discernible tumor at the time you 're making that decision , that kind of approach is going to lead to significant delays in the recurrences of cancer . The typical woman who dies of breast cancer does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the tumor has come back at the same local site , although that is a certain problem . But the real problem that we 're trying to address is that the woman may come back with disease at a distant site and then die of that disease , and therefore I see we 're going to have fundamental differences in how women are going to be treated . Dr. S : What about fat and breast cancer ? Dr. B : There are still many things we do n't know about breast cancer , but there are some things that we do . Everything we know about breast cancer suggests that in one way or another certain types of estrogen stimulation seem to play some kind of role . We know that 's one of the factors for breast cancer , and there is a large database of information on that . Diets high in animal fats are thought to contribute to an increased risk of breast cancer , and it is possible that they affect the amount of interiorestrogen stimulation in a woman 's body , but we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estrogen in the birth-control pill compare in amount to the replacement estrogen that is used for postmenopausal women ? Dr. B : It really depends on the dose that the doctor chooses , and there 's still some controversy with it . One issue with breast cancer and the pill is that there are some suggestive data  --  not firm data , suggestive data  --  that taking the pill might be a risk factor for acquiring breast cancer for some women . There are physicians on both sides on this . Within the Cancer Institute , we have recently launched a special study which will try to specifically address that point , and we will try to find out if there 's that risk . We know certain things about breast cancer already in that if you start menstruating early , if you have a late menopause , if you wait until after the age continued on page 104 104 // Dialogue on Cancer continued from page 46 of 30 to have your first full-term delivery  --  these are all things that have a factor that increases the odds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altering the hormonal milieu , but we do not have the precise facts . We 're trying seriously to consider an area in which doctors have no consensus . But one of the questions that might be worth asking is would it be worthwhile to give an anti-estrogen drug to women who might be at risk of breast cancer , let 's say after the age of 50 , as an almost pharmacological nutrient . Tamoxifen is a substance that blocks the activity of estrogen and has relatively low side effects . Dr. S : How is it used ? Dr. B : Tamoxifen is used in people with advanced breast cancer , but the question is would that be something that we should test . I want to be very clear on this , and if you choose to write about this , please make it clear that I 'm not saying that tamoxifen be used for the purpose I 've just suggested . What I would hope is that doctors and scientists will ask whether the time is right to make this a test and ask for a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they have some history of breast cancer in their family . Some women who do not have cancer would volunteer to receive tamoxifen while they are well . And some women would volunteer to receive tamoxifen or receive a placebo . Such a study would be followed for a certain number of years , and we would then learn whether giving tamoxifen in that setting would prevent the development of breast cancer . Dr. S : If you had a group of women who said , " Yes , we would like to do that , " how soon might it be tried ? Dr. B : You have to understand that what I 'm suggesting would still be considered controversial in the scientific community , so you would not necessarily reach a consensus ; not all doctors and scientists would say the time is right to do this , or there might be additional factors . In order to do what I 'm proposing , by the way , one would need to be able to really work out all the issues about whether there 's any toxicity or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about colon cancer ? Dr. B : The same thing with colon cancer . My prediction for the future July/August ' 89 will be that if somebody comes in with colon cancer and has microscopic spread beyond the place where the colon cancer started  --  even in microscopic amounts and even if all the lymph nodes seem to be taken out of the person 's body  --  such a person has about a 50 percent chance of having the tumor come back , let 's say in three to five years . And we will have , I predict confidently , therapies which will make an impact against that . I do not think they will solve the whole problem , but we will lower that high percentage . We are not going to cure people , necessarily , but we will certainly reduce the risk and delay the time that it will take for somebody in that setting to be at risk for cancer again . So I think confidently  --  take it to the bank  --  that those therapies will be part of the common practice . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer around the corner , and that 's why I want to balance my entire discussion with you , as always , good news and bad news , and I do n't want to end any discussion of cancer on either an excessively upbeat note or an excessively downbeat note . I think we have areas where we 've made progress . I think we have areas where we have not made as much progress as we want or we have n't made any progress , but I am continuously optimistic about the future .
