Resentment is building in the nation 's black urban ghettos <P> There is a rising tide of bitterness in black America . It existed well before the vicious race riot last month that killed 16 people and sent ugly plumes of smoke into the night skies over Miami . But the violence caught the attention of white America-and that fact too causes further black cynicism . Black leaders , echoing their pleas of the riot-punctuated 1960s , are asking once again : Do we have to burn our own neighborhoods in order to be heard ? <P> The black voices are angry . " I go out there and see these houses all boarded up . I see some gutted . I see vacant lots and weeds , " says Congressman Louis Stokes of Cleveland . " I see these guys standing around doing nothing . I feel so helpless , so hopeless . We 're passing from one generation to another a group of people who are hopelessly locked into a permanent underclass . " <P> " In the ' 60s , young blacks were looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were saying , ' I am somebody , ' " recalls the Rev. Thomas Kilgore , who heads a predominantly black group of 218 activist clergymen in Los Angeles . " Now they do n't feel that way . The black community does not have the kind of hope it had then . " <P> " It is no wonder young black youths are predisposed to riot , " says Ed Irons , a black professor of banking and finance at Atlanta University . " Even when the economy is going strong they do n't get hired . You ca n't attribute this to anything but institutional racism . America does not want to face this . At some point it is going to explode . " <P> An Associated Press-NBC News poll taken after the Miami riot found that 53% of Americans fear that there will be more racial riots in other cities this summer . At the same time , 84% of the whites thought blacks were better off now than ten years ago . But they are wrong , and that is precisely the point ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghetto . Despite the programs that raised so much hope , despite the brave talk by politicians about rescuing the cities , despite the thousands of success stories that seem to prove the contrary , urban blacks have been slipping farther and farther behind whites . <P> In the decade of the 1970s , blacks gained on whites in only one broad area : education . As of 1978 , the median for blacks had reached 11.9 years of schooling ; it was 12.5 for whites . Yet even these statistics are misleading in one important sense : the quality of public schooling that the blacks are getting in most major U.S. cities has sharply declined . Says Bernard C. Watson , a black vice president of Temple University in Philadelphia : " The education too many children receive in these classrooms is nothing short of a national scandal , an absolute disgrace .
