Pope John Paul II passed a major milestone last week by naming 25 new Cardinals and placing his personal stamp on the body that will one day name his successor . The present Pope 's appointees now constitute a 64% majority of the 121 Cardinals currently eligible to vote , and the latest batch , representing 18 countries , continues John Paul 's internationalizing trend . Three years ago the traditionally dominant Europeans were reduced to less than half the voting Cardinals ( those under age 80 ) . This time the balance of power has shifted farther from the West . The twelve North American electors , for example , are equaled in number by Asians and exceeded by the 16 Africans . <P> In geopolitical terms , the most interesting appointees are Lithuania 's Vincentas Sladkevicius , 67 , and Hong Kong 's John Baptist Wu Cheng-Chung , 63 . Sladkevicius , who spent 23 years under house arrest , is the second Cardinal resident in the Soviet Union . Wu , if he lives until 1997 , will be the first Cardinal in Communist China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The new U.S. Cardinals are James Hickey , 67 , of Washington , and Edmund Szoka , 60 , of Detroit . Both have shown the firm doctrinal mettle the Pope admires . As chancellor of the Catholic University of America , Hickey handled the ouster of Charles Curran from the theology faculty . Szoka forced a nun who administered state abortion payments to leave her order . <P> Among those conspicuously passed over : American Paul Marcinkus , whose Vatican Bank has been entangled in scandal , and St. Louis ' John May , president of the U.S. bishops ' conference . A possible explanation for bypassing May is that St. Louis has declined in ecclesiastical importance . But insiders speculate about another reason : May 's insistence at last fall 's Vatican synod that women 's concerns are not just some " American aberration . " That is not a message the present Roman Pontiff likes to hear .
