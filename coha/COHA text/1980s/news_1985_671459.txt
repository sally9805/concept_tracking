This is a good time of year to think about growing ferns in the garden . They are not difficult . As many as 200 species are native to the temperate United States and they can be found dispersed over a wide range of habitats . If a fern garden is on the list of landscaping projects , decide the type . Ferns thrive in bogs , marshes , moist woods , along rocky slopes . A few are at home in desertlike terrain . Many will adapt to a range of habitats , but most prefer an environment that is created with chosen habitats in mind. // When selecting the type of habitat , study the piece of land to see what it offers naturally . Traits of a garden site can often be modified to meet the needs of more demanding species . However , if fern species are selected that are compatable with the natural characteristics , the results will require less care and provide greater satisfaction. // In siting a woodland fern garden a primary consideration is the availability of appropriate light . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the open canopies of trees such as oaks and red maples . The dense shade found beneath heavily foliated Norway maples or the lee of evergreens is inhospitable to many woodland plants . If a promising garden site has excessive shade , prune or " limb up " to lighten the tree ' s canopy. // The species of trees under which the garden is developed should also be considered . Shallow rooted maples and beech trees , especially in soils that are neither deep nor rich in organic matter , can tie up the bulk of a soil ' s available moisture and leave little for ferns . Deep rooted trees such as oaks make excellent fern companions . With evergreens , pruning can spoil the appearance . If light is a problem , consider moving the garden to another site. // Most woodland ferns require a steady supply of water and close proximity to a source will be welcome in dry years . Avoid planting sites with shallow soils that tend to dry out quickly. // Healthy , vigorous ferns depend upon a well drained soil that retains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a depleted soil to achieve a well drained , moisture retaining media . Peat moss is commonly used to improve a soil ' s structure and will do an excellent job . However , it is not cheap . If you have access to compost , rotted manure or well shredded leaves the soil could ask for nothing better . Apply generously and the end product will be a soil in which woodland ferns prosper. // Many ferns have specific pH requirements . The majority of easily grown woodland varieties prefer a slightly acid soil . Unless the garden is sitting on limestone , it will probably tend naturally to a slightly acid character . A number of the more intriguing and desirable woodland ferns insist upon an alkaline reaction and are found in the wild where limestone or a similar material is prevalent. // A garden site of natural or artificial soil pockets separated one from the other is ideally suited to including different fern species having a variety of soil preferences . Before beginning preparation , check the pH in each planting area . Small soil pockets can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own terms. // Diversity is a term not often used to describe a fern planting , but it ought to be . The many shadings of green and brown , the multitude of frond forms and the distinctive habits of growth possessed by different species can be combined to create a subtle series of becoming contrasts . No fern garden need be bland for want of distinctive plant material. // The following ferns are easily grown in a woodland setting where the soil is slightly to moderately acidic . At the top of the list is the eastern maidenhair ( Adiantum pedatum ) . The delicate , fanlike fronds disguise its true character as one of the hardiest and most reliable native ferns . Growing from an expanding rhizome , it will slowing spread as the seasons pass . A more invasive woodland grower is the lady fern , ( Athyrium filix-femina ) . The lacy , light green fronds are noted for their variability , which has on occasion led to confusion in efforts to correctly identify this species ' s many different forms . It grows from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread rapidly under favorable conditions . For a small fern planting , avoid this potential take-over artist , lovely as it is. // A number of woodland ferns are evergreen , adding a touch of color to the winter garden . The most familiar is the Christmas fern , ( Polystichum acrostichoides ) . The dark green fronds will persist through winter . With the coming of spring , the old fronds wither and collapse , ushering in the fresh green foliage of the new season. // Two evergreen species of a single genus are common to wooded areas and perfect additions for the small or large fern garden . Evergreen wood fern ( Dryopteris spinulosa var. intermedia ) can be recognized by its delicately cut , dark green fronds roughly two feet in length . The marginal wood fern ( D. marginalis ) has a more coarsely cut frond of a similiar hue and size . Both grow from central crowns , slowly expanding in a well behaved manner. // For shallow , rocky spots there is the evergreen common polypody , ( Polypodium virginianum ) . This small fern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length and abhors the deep , rich soils favored by most other woodland species . It prefers to creep over rock and stone , rooting in the shallow soil found among the crevises . The rusty woodsia ( Woodsia ilvensis ) is also at home in a rocky locale where the soil is lean . Pale green , 12-inch fronds emerge from a crown . During periods of drought these fronds shrivel and droop returning to life with the return of ample water. // An odd native species is the Hart ' s tongue fern , ( Phyllitis scolopendrium ) . This evergreen has tongue-shaped fronds , six or more inches in length . There are numerous interesting cultivars of this species , including an elegant crested form , all of easy culture which contasts sharply with the rarity of this fern ' s occurence in the wild. // Among the woodland ferns prefering an alkaline soil , none is more intriguing than walking fern , ( Camptosorus rhizophyllus ) . The long , tapering fronds tip-root when they touch upon a suitable spot . Planted along an incline , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon suitable soil. // The delicate , evergreen maidenhair spleenwort , ( Asplenium trichomanes ) is a choice selection among lime lovers . Fronds no more than six inches in length radiate out from a central crown . The bulblet fern ( Cystopteris bulbifera ) has light green , intricately incised fronds up to three feet in length . Small bulblets capable of taking root and growing into a new fern develop in the axils of each frond . I have found this fern to be quite tolerant of slightly acid soils. // One of the most beautiful imported ferns that belongs in a woodland garden is the Japanese painted fern , ( Athyrium niponicum ) . The two foot long fronds of this slow growing fern can highlight any fern planting with their tones of green , silver and burgundy. // Once the fern garden is established , its most pressing need will be water . A mulch of shredded leaves , shredded bark or parially made compost should be maintained year round . Ferns are not heavy feeders and should be able to acquire the nutrients they need as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light application of a slow release fertilizer will help alleviate the shortcoming. // Few insects present a serious threat to ferns . Snails and slugs can be a menace . There are a number of ways to deal with these creatures . Ringing lime-loving ferns with diatomaceous earth , which a slug or snail crosses at its peril , helps to deter them . Setting out small boards throughout the garden during the day will lure the night feeding slugs and snails under their cooling shade . Check the boards in the afternoon and dispatch any resting there . Toads , frogs and birds can also be surprisingly helpful in controlling these pests. // Diseases will ordinarily not trouble a healthy fern planting . Excessively wet soil should be avoided as it invites damping-off and root rot . Ferns do need an evenly moist soil , but the woodland varieties have little tolerance for sodden soils . Leaf spotting is a rare occurence and can be minimized by assuring the planting receives good air circulatiion and proper light . Should a fern develop a serious rot or blight , immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disorder. //
