The 80-minute productions , which are taped rather than filmed and use less costly production techniques than theatrical movies , star actors who will be familiar to TV audiences , and include Dack Rambo of " All My Children " and " Dallas " ; Parker Stevenson of " The Hardy Boys " and the mini-series " North and South " ; Jean LeClerc of " All My Children , " and Simon MacCorkindale of " Falcon Crest . " The female leads , however , are not quite as familiar because marketing tests found that women viewers - the " target audience " for these productions - prefer to identify with an unknown face. // Each of the cassettes , based on original stories by writers of romance novels , has a color in the title . There is " Lilac Dream , " about a woman who runs off to a secluded island to forget a failed love affair , only to have a man wash up on the beach nearly drowned and suffering from amnesia . There ' s also " The Rose Cafe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a former schoolmate re-enters her life . The tales are romantic rather than sexual , full of long gazes , blazing fires and horse-drawn carriage rides. // In the short but frenetic history of the video-cassette market , feature-length films have rarely been produced directly for VCR ' s , but are distributed to movie theaters first . The reason : Such films cost millions to make and , ideally , that money is eventually recouped through theater receipts , pay TV rights and video rentals. // Tapes made directly for home video - a development known as video publishing - would have fewer sources of revenue but lower production budgets , the logic goes . Industry executives have long believed that consumers would never choose a cheaper-looking evening ' s entertainment when they could rent a more elaborately produced film for the same price. // But video producers , who have had success in recent years with the direct marketing of tapes featuring cooking lessons , exercise classes and stand-up comics , are now eager to broaden the range of video publishing . Lorimar , for instance , is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was the company that surprised the industry when it proved that women would spend $70 to exercise with Jane Fonda. // Paramount Home Video , in turn , recently introduced its five-tape " Paramount Comedy Theater " series , the first comedy presentation developed directly for home video . The current series , with " St. Elsewhere ' s " Howie Mandel as host , features stand-up comics performing in comedy clubs. // And Frank Zappa , whose avant-garde and often risque films are routinely banned by broadcast and cable channels , announced last week that he has created his own production company , Honker Home Video , which will produce projects directly for home viewing . The first four releases are scheduled for next fall and will include " Baby Snakes - The Complete Version , " Mr. Zappa ' s 1979 film that combines concert footage with ribald clay animation to which he will add extra material , and " Uncle Meat , " a recently completed performance-art feature that Mr. Zappa has been working on for 20 years. // Lorimar ' s project is unusual too , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To compete with the more elaborate competition , the " Shades of Love " films , which cost about $1 million each to produce , are being sold for $14. 95 a piece . They are being offered not only in video stores but in all Ekhard Drug , Walden Books and Sears department stores as well and are being introduced with an extensive advertising campaign. // It is fitting , perhaps , that " Shades of Love " began with a man who did not know the rules , and thus did not know that he was breaking them . Kenneth J. Atchity could be termed a scholar of love and romance . The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur has a Ph . D. in comparative literature from Yale University and is the author of several books , including two on Homer and one about Italian literature. // Over the years , however , he became fascinated by romance novels , a genre to which readers often become quickly addicted ; some buy an average of one such book every two days . He was struck by the books , Dr. Atchity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good but because they were , for the most part , so bad. // " They are not very well written , and that intrigued me even further , " he said . " If people were buying them in such quantities and they were so awful , then there really must be something spellbinding there . " In 1980 , after 10 years as a professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles , he founded L/A House Inc. , with the intention of bringing these romances to video cassette . He theorized that the women who read these novels would be bored by filmed versions of books already in print . So , he commissioned original stories from such romance writers as Serita Stevens , Cassie Morgan , Judy Boyington and Annette Sanford - authors whose works are well-known to romance readers , if not to the world at large. // Mr. Atchity also theorized that fans of romance novels were not looking for weighty permanence in their books ; few are hardcover , and publishing industry figures show that only 10 to 15 percent are retained on home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films directly for home video , hoping that consumers would choose his $1 million creations over a multi-million creation on the neighboring shelf. // Other video producers are reacting to the fledgling line with a mixture of interest and scepticism. // " This could be a brilliant idea in a competitive environment , " said Strauss Zelnick , executive vice president of business affairs at Vestron , which distributes dozens of how-to titles directly for home video but only feature-length films that have already been shown on TV or movie screens first . " But there are some fundamental problems . Can the production costs be low enough and the production values high enough to keep people interested ? Do people who read romance novels want to see the story or use their imagination ? " // Mr. Atchity and his associates at Lorimar say they are confident about the future and plan to release four more romances in December . A sign of their optimism can be discerned in the meeting Mr. Atchity had recently with the advertising agency handling the " Shades of Love " account. // " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line , " Mr. Atchity said . " But then we decided that won ' t happen for several years. " //
