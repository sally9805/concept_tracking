The conservative Republican Administration had come to Washington to change the nation ' s priorities and sought to repeal or modify major portions of New Deal and Great Society legislation. // Had the Administration gone the traditional route , addressing individual programs and shepherding changes through committee hearings and debates followed by floor action in both Houses of Congress , it would have succeeded in changing perhaps a handful of programs . <> <> How Victory Was Won // Instead , the Administration seized upon the Congressional budget process and a little-used vehicle called " reconciliation , " in which Congress instructs its committees to make substantive changes in the law to meet budget-cutting targets. // The resulting slashing of social programs that had become part of the nation ' s economic and social fabric appears to be a turning point for the nation and a triumph for conservatism rivaling the liberal triumphs of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. // The keys to the victory were the President ' s continued popularity , a formidable telephone lobbying effort and the support of 29 conservative Democrats who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own. // As a result , the House yesterday followed the Senate ' s lead in enacting changes in 250 programs , ranging from food stamps to guaranteed student loans to cost-of-living increases in Federal retirees ' s pensions. // The budget package also included consolidation of dozens of specific , categorical grants for social programs into a handful of block grants , with spending priorities to be determined by the states. // Both Republicans and Democrats acknowledged yesterday that they did not know the full scope of legislative changes contained in the bill . They agreed that it would probably take years for the full effect of the measure to be felt. // Opponents of the Administration ' s plan argued that the White House had distorted the budget process . " We are dealing with more than 250 programs with no hearings , no deliberation , no debate , " said Representative Leon E. Panetta , Democrat of California , an influential member of the Budget Committee. // The bill ' s sponsors contended , however , that the nation had mandated economic and social change and that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration insisted on ideological purity , sacrificing programs that it acknowledged had worked in an effort to achieve its overall goals , it resorted to old-fashioned wheeling and dealing to gain the votes needed for enactment . The Administration promised to support programs such as sugar loan subsidies and Conrail funds to win votes. // As a result , the bill was being rewritten well into Thursday evening , and copies were not available to House members until yesterday afternoon . <> <> Stockman Designed Strategy // The process began last December shortly after Mr. Reagan announced his intention to appoint David A. Stockman , a newly re-elected Republican member of the House of Representatives , as director of the Office of Management and Budget. // Mr. Stockman designed a strategy of stunning audacity . Working extraordinarily long hours , Mr. Stockman pored over budget documents to find places to cut . The result was a three-pound black book entitled " America ' s New Beginning : A Program for Economic Recovery , " sent to Congress Feb. 18 . It detailed proposed cuts in scores of programs. // One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socalled " entitlement " programs , under which Federal funds are spent without any Congressional action because recipients are entitled by law to the benefits received . These programs include Social Security , food stamps , Federal guarantees for student loans , child nutrition aid , Aid to Families with Dependent Children , Medicaid , umemployment insurance and trade adjustment assistance for workers who displaced by foreign competition. // It was Mr. Stockman who conceived of incorporating these changes in a " reconciliation " bill of budget cuts . Heretofore , reconciliation had been used at the end of the budget process to bring spending into line with budget targets . The Administration proposed to use the budget cuts at the beginning of the process , a procedure Democrats contended was a distortion of legislative procedures , which traditionally provide for lengthy deliberation of program changes. // In the following weeks , Mr. Stockman was a tireless presence on Capitol Hill , testifying daily before two or three House and Senate panels , leading some members to ask when he found time to sleep. // Barely a month later , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $35 billion . In those few instances in which moderate Republicans sought to restore funds for some social programs , they were thwarted by conservative Democrats who crossed over to support the Administration ' s package. // However , the major battle would be in the Democratic-controlled House . The Democratic leadership , led by Speaker Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr. , railed against the " callousness " of the proposed cuts . Only yesterday Mr. O ' Neill called the Administration plan " a deliberate effort to transfer wealth from the struggling families of this country and award that wealth to those who are already wealthy. " // Last month the House adopted the President ' s proposed budget for fiscal 1982 . The Democratic leadership and the House budget committee had supported a budget that gave the President 75 percent of the cuts he wanted . But the Republicans proposed an alternative budget that met the White House request . <> <> Cufflinks for Conservatives // The House vote was scheduled after the Easter recess , which Mr. Reagan used to woo conservative Democrats and plead for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The Democratic leadership , on the other hand , was uncharacteristically silent . Little effort was made to mobilize the forces that would normally oppose such a budget : labor , urban and minority groups , the elderly and other segments of the traditional Democratic constituency. // The Reagan-endorsed $695 billion budget for the fiscal year 1982 won an easy victory in the House , with 63 conservative Democrats voting for it . Mr. O ' Neill said that he knew that Mr. Reagan would win his first legislative battle when he watched the election returns last November . But the package of budget cuts would be something else , he insisted. // The President had appealed to the conservative Democrats to support his budget because , he said , they would merely be voting for budget targets . The actual cuts would come later , under the normal budgetwriting procedure , as the legislature deliberated on exactly where the cuts would come . But Representative Phil Gramm , Democrat of Texas , co-sponsor of the Administration ' s budget proposals , had warned the House that " We ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package , which included instructions to the 15 House committees , would be rigorously enforced. // In fact , the House committees more than met the targets . Asked to cut $35. 1 billion from current spending levels , they cut a total of $37. 7 billion. // The Administration contended , however , that many of those cuts were illusory , counterproductive and overly severe . For example , a committee recommendation to close 10 , 000 small post offices would never be carried out , the Administration said , nor would a proposal to slash aid to schools near military bases . <> <> Administration Counterproposal // The Administration countered with a proposal that deepened the cuts by $5. 2 billion , but restored $3 billion in spending in other areas , for a net cut of $2. 2 billion . The Administration proposal cut deeply into the entitlement programs and included the block grant proposals. // This package of budget cuts , totaling $38. 2 billion , was approved by the House yesterday , with the help of 29 conservative Democrats who joined a nearly solid Republican phalanx. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conservative Democrats , based mostly on ideology , has completely wrested control of the House from the Democratic leadership and will prevail on the coming tax package . Today the Democratic leaders are not optimistic. //
