Men are chefs . Women are cooks . Or at least that was once the conventional view . No longer . Now , whether in their own restaurants or as employees , women across the U.S. have earned their toques as chefs : the leaders of kitchen staffs , not merely cooks who work at their own stations . To suggest a woman as chef even ten years ago would have prompted laughter . Women , went the old calumny , are not creative enough to be chefs . And anyway , how could they lift those hot 60-qt. stockpots ? " Very carefully , " says Joan Woodhull , 20 , a recent graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park , N.Y. , where 25% of the 1,850 students are women . <P> Slowly and after considerable struggle , this band of feisty and talented women , mostly in the U.S. but also in France and England , have wrested for themselves the full title of chef . To be sure , female cooks in restaurants have a long and honored history . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes without deviation , both in American mom-and-pop eateries and especially in France , where the cuisine de femme ( woman 's cooking ) was celebrated by Escoffier . <P> But these women were accorded little status precisely because they never altered dishes . Top honors went to the male chefs , who had undergone long classical training either as apprentices or in professional schools , and who were celebrated for their creativity and inventiveness with new dishes . A case in point : La Mere Blanc in Vonnas , France , was long a famous cuisine de femme restaurant , but it earned Michelin 's three-star rating only after Georges Blanc took over from his mother and began to dream up nouvelle haute cuisine . <P> As in other arenas , women seeking full status in the kitchen have had to prove themselves by beating men at their own game . Most neither requested nor accepted help along the way . Mary Sue Milliken , who with her chef-partner Susan Feniger owns the Mexico-inspired Border Grill and the Oriental-eclectic City Restaurant in Los Angeles , recalls that in earlier kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollandaise sauce made with two cases of egg yolks . " <P> No one paid heavier dues than tiny , 5-ft. - tall Anne Rosenzweig , who during her first unpaid apprenticeship was made to lift all the stockpots alone , even though men in the kitchen helped one another . " The European chef there was miserable and kept saying that women had no strength , no stamina and no concentration , " says Rosenzweig , who went on to become the controversial vice chairman at Manhattan 's exclusive " 21 " Club , as well as chef-partner at her own New York City restaurant , Arcadia . Overprotectiveness , not abuse , was what almost undermined Leslie Revsin , a chef at the Barbizon Hotel in Manhattan . She recalls that men rushed to help her with any heavy task , even when she did n't need help . Revsin managed , however , and in 1972 became the first female " kitchen man " and then chef at the Waldorf-Astoria , an event that prompted headlines in local newspapers .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
