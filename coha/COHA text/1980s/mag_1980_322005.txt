Seldom have envoys and embassies faced so many hazards-and catcalls <P> " My slowly creeping doubt is that we may be contemplating the beginning of the end of diplomacy-not as an art , which we will always need , but as an institution . " <P> So warned Italy 's Roberto Ducci last month , retiring as Rome 's Ambassador to London after 42 years in his country 's foreign service . Indeed , seldom before in modern history has diplomacy been so dangerous , or so seemingly discredited , a calling . The clear and ugly danger is represented by terrorists who look on embassies and diplomatic missions as ripe , highly visible targets of opportunity , and their occupants as valuable hostages . At the same time , the traditional role of the diplomat , as an international negotiator , has been to some degree rendered obsolete in an age of Instant communications , when heads of state and foreign ministers personally conduct essential business , sometimes without consulting their appointed envoys . American embassies , symbols of " imperialism , " are special targets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the target of much criticism by both allies and enemies-criticism inspired by what too often seems to be insufficiently considered policies announced by President Carter and his aides . <P> Last week the turmoil besetting the diplomatic scene reverberated dramatically on three fronts : <P> &gt; In Tehran , an apparent move toward the possible release of the hostages held by militants at the U.S. embassy came just as a special U.N . commission was ready to give up in abject failure . The militants , who have occupied the embassy for more than four months , prepared to turn over their 50 prisoners to Iran 's ruling Revolutionary Council , but at week 's end were still arguing with Iranian government officials as to when the transfer might actually take place . <P> &gt; In Bogot , walk-on-eggs negotiations between the Colombian government and leftist guerrillas holding diplomatic hostages at the embassy of the Dominican Republic produced the release last week of another prisoner . Several other envoys were among the hostages still being held at gun point inside the building . <P> &gt; In Washington , Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " U.S. vote in favor of a U.N . Security Council resolution calling upon Israel to dismantle all of its settlements in the occupied territories . This astonishing policy turnabout managed to antagonize both Israelis and Arabs , raised new doubts among America 's allies about the credibility of Carter 's foreign policy , and contributed to the already shaky morale of the U.S. Foreign Service . U.S. diplomacy had seldom seen darker hours .
