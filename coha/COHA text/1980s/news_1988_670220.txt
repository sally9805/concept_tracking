Last week ' s 102-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  --  to a new post-crash high of 2090. 19  --  occurred largely because investors felt reassured that the dollar probably won ' t plummet and interest rates aren ' t likely to soar . This week , investors will keep a wary eye on that monthly wild card , the merchandise trade deficit , due to be reported Thursday morning . If they have any attention left for anything else , they should be gladdened by the start of the parade of corporate earnings reports for the first quarter . These numbers are generally expected to look great . But how these tidy earnings gains will play in the stock market is an open question . The Institutional Brokerage Estimate Service ( IBES ) of Lynch Jones Ryan says the latest data compiled from analysts ' reports show that the average growth in first-quarter earnings for the 500 companies whose stocks are in Standard &; Poor ' s index is expected to be a healthy 12. 7% on a market-weighted basis . Zacks ' Investment Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 concerns in the S &; will be 19% higher than a year earlier . According to the two research services , some of the biggest boosts will be reported by large industrial companies riding the weaker dollar to an improved competitive position . Among the big gainers will be chemical , paper and forest product , semiconductor and metal companies . Those expected to show lower results than a year before are savings and loans , insurance companies and retailers . " What ' s showing up in the earnings estimates is what ' s going on in the economy , " says Ben Zacks , executive vice president of Zacks . " The export-sensitive , currency-sensitive stocks are getting upgraded , and consumer companies are getting downgraded . " Dirk van Dijk , a research analyst at IBES , says that " in terms of analysts ' revisions , the basic industry sector has just been beating the pants off the rest of the market . " Of course , to a great extent the stock prices of the various companies that will be reporting higher earnings already reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any particular stock when the company reports its earnings  --  unless analysts ' estimates are seriously out of kilter . As portfolio strategists puzzle over the market impact of this wave of good news , they come up with some sharply divergent opinions . Peter Canelo , chief strategist for Bear Stearns , says he expects about a 12% profit increase . If that pans out , he doesn ' t think the stock market will be much affected . " A gain of 12% might not look so colossal , but it says ' no recession ' and ' no overheating of the economy , ' " he says . " It ' s a fine number . " But other analysts think that hidden in the good news for individual stocks is some bad news for the economy and the stock market . Arnold Kaufman , editor of Standard &; Poor ' s Outlook newsletter , agrees that earnings were strong in the first quarter " but I don ' t think it will be necessarily positive for the stock market . " He says American industry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overheating economy . " Certainly a good profits number will bolster individual stocks , but on the whole , investors will look at it as further evidence that perhaps the economy is too strong and inflation is going to speed up , " he says . Abby Joseph Cohen , a market strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , doesn ' t deny that at some point good news such as healthy earnings leads to inflation , then higher interest rates , and eventually a recession . But she suggests that investors sit back and enjoy the good news . " The question isn ' t whether that ' s going to happen , it ' s when , " she says . " Our feeling is that it isn ' t going to happen this year. "  --  - Friday ' s Market Activity Stocks soared Friday , spurred by declining interest rates . The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 2090. 19 , up 28. 02 , narrowly surpassing the previous post-crash high of 2087. 37 , set on March 18 . The 102-point gain for the week was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 18  --  the best calendar-week performance on record . Volume Friday on the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 169. 3 million shares ; advancing issues on the Big Board outpaced decliners by 2-to-1 . Staley Continental was the biggest gainer for the day . It shot up 5 7/8 to 37 3/8 after British sugar refiner Tate &; Lyle offered $32 a share for the rest of Staley ' s shares it doesn ' t currently own . Tate &; Lyle bought 5% of Staley last November . American Stores gained 3 1/8 to 65 1/2 .

After the market closed , Stevens said the Federal Trade Commission had issued a second request for information on the West Point-Pepperell offer  --  a move Odyssey claimed might signal antitrust problems or at least slow any new West Point-Pepperell bid .
