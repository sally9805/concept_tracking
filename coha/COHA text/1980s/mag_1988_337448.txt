For TV and radio evangelists , 1987 seemed like the Fall and the Flood combined . The PTL fiasco and other scandals produced unseemly bickering , a plague of embarrassing behavior , threats of government intervention and  --  most grievous of all  --  a disastrous drop in financial contributions . Clearly the preachers had to act to restore confidence or face perpetual chaos . Last week in Washington , the broadcasters did just that . Overcoming deep-seated traditions of independence and secrecy , they agreed to regulate themselves and monitor one another 's business practices . <P> The occasion was the annual convention of National Religious Broadcasters , whose 1,350 members include most of the big organizations except those of Oral Roberts and Robert Schuller . Among the detailed new standards to be required of N.R.B. members : open and audited finances , records of pitches for money in case questions are raised , and governing boards controlled by outsiders rather than by family members and employees . <P> To exhort any slackers , N.R.B. leaders brought in Elder Statesman Billy Graham for some stem winding before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being tested , " declared the evangelist . " Our greatest need is moral integrity ! " But the broadcasters required little prodding . " All of them recognize they can not permit another bombshell to explode at their feet , " observed Jeffrey Hadden , a University of Virginia sociologist . One index of public discontent : a poll by the Williamsburg Charter Foundation last week showed that 40% of Americans think it should be illegal for preachers to raise money on TV . <P> The financial wreckage from last year is still being added up . At PTL , 1987 viewer revenues plummeted to $41 million from the $96 million of Jim and Tammy Bakker 's hyperhustling final year . In one seven-month period , Christian Broadcasting Network revenues fell 32.5% , compared with the same time in 1986  --  a drop that partly reflected the loss of its star , Pat Robertson , to presidential politics . Jerry Falwell 's income for March through October was $6 million less than projections . Jimmy Swaggart and Oral Roberts refuse to disclose their 1987 results , but the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these top preachers have also dropped . <P> Still , the evangelists remain a force to be reckoned with , collectively taking in well over $1 billion a year and attracting millions of faithful radio and TV listeners . During the year of discontent there was even some growth . The new N.R.B. directory shows increases in TV stations ( from 221 to 259 ) , radio stations ( 1,370 to 1,393 ) and groups producing programs ( 1,010 to 1,068 ) . Mindful of these signs of continued strength , President and Mrs. Reagan visited the N.R.B. meeting . Robertson and fellow Candidates George Bush , Robert Dole and Jack Kemp also cleared their campaign schedules to appear , though none of the Democratic hopefuls did .
