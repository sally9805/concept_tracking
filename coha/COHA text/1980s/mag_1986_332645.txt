The argument began , police say , when Beverli Black accused her boyfriend of spending their last $15 on crack .

Daren Jenkins , 23 , an unemployed cabinetmaker , stalked over to the bed where Black 's son Batik was sleeping .

In May of this year cocaine arrests were up 68% over the figures for May 1985 , while arrests for heroin , marijuana and other drugs had dropped .

Wendell Foster , a Bronx city councilman : " It 's a new form of genocide . " <P> Last week New York 's United Black Church Appeal launched a valiant campaign against the drug . Some 200 ministers , celebrities and antidrug activists participated in street-corner rallies and 24-hour vigils in areas where crack is sold .

" I 'll never understand why , if they 're serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world a week before they make it , " said Comedian and Liberal Activist Dick Gregory .

The new legislation could end up costing the government $5 billion a year . " If it breaks Gramm-Rudman , " said O'Neill , " I 'll ask the Rules Committee to waive the targets . " Not to be left behind by the Democrats , a Reagan Administration Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House initiative in the drug war . <P> Back in New York , shortly after the rallies and speeches ended , the crack hustlers were out again , casually hawking their wares . " They should have been here long ago , " said a disillusioned Harlem resident of the antidrug crusaders . " It 's too late now . "
