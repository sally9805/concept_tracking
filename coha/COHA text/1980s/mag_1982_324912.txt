A store , a gas station or a typewriter can raise the spirits and make life easier <P> Most 1981 design was not bad . It was awful . But the few new urban places , buildings , industrial products and graphics that were good , were very , very good . The awfulness was not just a matter of bad taste . A little kitsch in dull surroundings can be as endearing as a whiff of horse manure in the city . The dismaying pollution of the cityscape , like that of the language , stems from illiterate and , worse , semiliterate pretentiousness . <P> The result is visual gobbledygook . An example is the new crop of " postmodern " buildings . They are three-dimensional collages of discrepant ornament and styles . The design of most new interiors , furniture , cars , appliances and printed matter also continues to follow ill-mannered fads rather than good form . A confusion of design with mere styling , packaging or form-giving still haunts our culture . <P> The successful designs of which the American public has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for attention in an already all too noisy world . They stand out because , like all first-rate design , they raise the human spirit and make life a little easier . <P> Good design is essentially a matter of problem solving . Engineers solve mechanical problems . Designers solve human problems-or should . If the design does not work well , it may be art , but it is not good design . <P> To make an object work , functionally and aesthetically , it must be placed in its proper context . A chair must fit into the room . The room must fit into the house . The house must fit into the street . The street must fit into the city . <P> Good design , furthermore , politely takes its place in the context of historic continuity . It does not parade in either a " traditional " or futuristic costume . As time goes by , the context keeps changing . That is why , as each new generation of designers must learn , even the best design does not seem to bring us closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 350 years ago , the best design gives us " commodity , firmness and delight . " <P> Here are the five best architectural and the five best industrial or graphic designs of the past year : <P> Bullock 's Northern California department store , San Mateo , Calif . L. Gene Zellmer Associates , architects ; Geiger Berger Associates , P.C. , structural engineers . A soaring , translucent tent structure provides shoppers with daylight and a festive atmosphere . San Antonio Museum of Art , Texas . Cambridge Seven Associates , Inc. , architects . A creative yet respectful transformation has turned the slightly loony old Lone Star Brewery into an imposing museum building . <P> Thorncrown Chapel , Eureka Springs , Ark . Fay Jones &; Associates , architects . A simple but evocative structure of pine boards , glass and ingenuity , designed by a student of Frank Lloyd Wright 's . It is one of the few buildings that advance the master 's concept of organic architecture . <P> Viet Nam Veterans Memorial , Washington , B.C. Maya Y. Lin , designer . A brilliantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the controversial war .
