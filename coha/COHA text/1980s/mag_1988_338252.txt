If anyone can change frugal comrades into free-spending Western-style consumers , Michael Jackson can . Or at least PepsiCo seems to think so . Last week the performer pirouetted his way onto Soviet TV in Pepsi commercials featuring slogans like " The new generation chooses Pepsi " that were superimposed in Russian . The ads , along with commercials for Visa credit cards and Sony TV sets , appeared in a series of talk shows with Soviet Commentator Vladimir Posner as host . He interviewed Americans in Seattle on subjects ranging from sex to presidential politics . The ads marked the first time that companies have been allowed to buy time on Soviet TV . <P> The advertisers were recruited by Global American Television , a small company based in Colrain , Mass. , and co-producer of several public affairs programs that have appeared on both U.S. and Soviet TV . Global American arranged for PepsiCo , Visa and Sony to buy ten minutes on Posner 's shows for $20,000 a minute , in contrast with up to $800,000 a minute that advertisers pay for prime time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make some money out of this . " <P> So can advertisers . PepsiCo , which had a virtual monopoly on Soviet cola sales until 1984 , faces competition from Coca-Cola , now sold in eleven Soviet cities . Visa cards will be issued to Soviet citizens who travel abroad later this year . Sony 's products are available only in stores that require payment in hard currency .
