Not long before dawn on Aug. 26 , Robert E. Chambers Jr. , 19 , and Jennifer Dawn Levin , 18 , strolled into New York City 's Central Park behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Something happened between them . Chambers allegedly strangled Levin , then remained nearby as morning rose and the body was discovered and removed . Even shockproof New York sat up straight and stared . Something about a killing on a summer night in the park , the brooding sweetness of the shadowed grass . Something more about two upper-middle-class teenagers walking casually into a nightmare reserved for naturalistic American novels : sensational grief , sensational murder trial , relentless public glare . <P> This sort of story was not supposed to happen to privileged children who command the city with their lusty self-assurance ; who shop at Benetton 's and Bergdorf 's , have plenty of style , plenty of clothes ; who do not leave home without American Express . But they do leave home . Breezy , noisy , they lope about the fashionable streets like flocks of orphans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorest children  --  hanging out , swooping into saloons where no one looks twice at the doctored ID cards ; the kids ' money is good . Do n't blame the saloonkeepers , say the sociologists . Blame the moral carelessness that parents pass off as the gift of freedom as they cut their children loose like colorful kites and wish them an exciting flight . <P> What is this perversion of freedom about ? In an enthralling series of articles on the Levin killing , Samuel G. Freedman of the New York Times observed that rich parents and poor parents are alike in their promiscuous freedom giving . The poor let their children hustle for subsistence . The rich buy them off . It is as if parents are afraid to touch the people they created ; and in a sense this may be so . By the time parents are old enough to have adolescent children , they often are undergoing second-adolescent turmoils of their own . The elder teenager beholds the younger and sees his biography in the making  --  tumultuous prelude to a tumultuous middle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents may be confounded by the fact that children are blatantly freer than they are themselves . A subculture of young people slide about the house , so much more alert than their parents to changes in music , movies , codes of dress ; quick as terriers ; loose as geese ; all things that age is not . The power of parents lies in experience and work . The power of children lies in the freedom from those things . Parents , who can not retrieve that sort of freedom , may regard it with bewilderment , even resentment . They keep their distance . <P> The central trouble seems simply that too many parents have forgotten that freedom gains meaning from restraint . In this they are creatures of their times . For thousands of years , various , and very different , definitions of freedom  --  Aristotelian , Cartesian , Augustinian , Kantian  --  have all related freedom to significant choice . Over the past 20 years , the idea of freedom has evolved like a mutated animal , involving the absence not only of significant choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of limitations , freedom has become dangerous and meaningless . If freedom has no restraints and embraces everything , then it risks becoming tyranny , since logically it must include tyranny among the things it embraces .
