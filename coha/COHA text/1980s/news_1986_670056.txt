NEW YORK  --  Bond prices swung widely again yesterday , winding up with small gains amid continued speculation that the Federal Reserve System will lower its discount rate soon . The economy ' s sluggishness and continued low inflation probably will prompt the Fed to lower the discount rate to 6 1/2% from 7% shortly , many analysts say . Some contend that such an action could come as early as this afternoon . Beryl Sprinkel , the Reagan administration ' s chief economist , indicated yesterday that he expects a discount rate cut . He said in an interview that he is reluctant to directly advocate such a move , saying , " That ' s not my decision to make . " But he said other interest rates have fallen to the point where " I think it ' s appropriate " for the Fed to lower the discount rate , which is the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions . Mr. Sprinkel didn ' t say when he expects the Fed to act . Some analysts argue that the Fed will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several say the Fed will defer any action until other major central banks lower their rates . The Fed lowered the discount rate to 7% from 7 1/2% March 7 . That action came shortly after carefully orchestrated rate cuts in West Germany and Japan . Fed officials , as usual , wouldn ' t discuss their credit policy plans . But many economists said the Fed earlier this week appeared to signal its intention to cut the discount rate soon when it didn ' t intervene in the credit markets to prevent a sharp drop in the interest rate on federal funds . The rate on fed funds , or reserves that banks lend one another overnight , averaged 7. 05% in the week ended Wednesday , down from 7. 39% the previous week . Yesterday , the funds rate hovered between 7% and 7 1/8% most of the day . Government reports to be released today and next week are likely to confirm that the economy remains listless and that the inflation picture remains bright , according to Alan C. Lerner , a senior vice president at Bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount rate cut by the Fed " imminently . " Mr. Lerner expects the government to report today that retail sales tumbled as much as 2% last month , following a 0. 1% decrease in February . The average estimate of 15 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report predicts a report of a 0. 7% decline in March retail sales . Separately , a report on producer prices , also to be released today , is likely to show a decline of about 0. 5% for last month , following a 1. 6% decrease in February , Mr. Lerner said . Albert M. Wojnilower , chief economist of First Boston Corp. , predicted yesterday that " substantial " interest rate declines are likely for the near future if the U.S. dollar doesn ' t tumble in the foreign exchange markets . But bond yields are apt to shoot up by late this year or early next year as investor concern about inflation reemerges , Mr. Wojnilower contended . Speaking at a business outlook conference in San Francisco , he said the steep drop in interest rates and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe for inflation as the economy continues to expand , he contended . Still , Mr. Wojnilower said " special circumstances , " including the collapse of oil prices and an impending cutback in automobile production , will help mask inflation " until late ( this ) year or early next . " Some analysts argue that the Fed already is easing credit conditions slightly because of the improved inflation outlook and because of concern about the economy ' s health . But David M. Jones , an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &; Co. , contended that Fed figures released yesterday indicated that the central bank hasn ' t altered its credit policy . Mr. Jones expects the Fed to hold off lowering the discount rate until late this month or early next month . " The Fed would like to coordinate a discount rate cut with other countries , " and that will take more time to accomplish , he said . Money supply statistics reported late yesterday by the Fed contained few surprises and thus had little effect on interest rates . The Fed said the basic money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week ended March 31 to a seasonally adjusted average of $640. 1 billion . That left it $1. 7 billion above the upper limit of the Fed ' s target range , when the target is drawn to resemble a cone . The Fed ' s target calls for 3% to 8% growth in M1 this year . For all of March , M1 averaged $638. 2 billion , up from $631 billion in February . Other Fed figures showed :  --  A broader money supply measure , M2 , rose $13. 6 billion in March to an average of $2. 5899 trillion . So far this year , M2 has grown at an annual rate of 4. 5% , compared with the Fed ' s target of 6% to 9% growth.  --  An even broader measure , M3 , increased $18 billion last month to an average of $3. 2586 trillion . This measure has expanded at a 7. 2% clip so far this year , leaving it comfortably within the Fed ' s 6% to 9% target.  --  During March , M2 grew at an annual rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6. 7% . In the credit markets yesterday , the Treasury ' s 9 1/4% bonds due 2016 closed at a price of 123 12/32 to yield 7. 31% . That compared with Wednesday ' s close of 123 6/32 to yield 7. 32% . The government ' s 8 7/8% notes due 1996 rose to 111 1/2 from 111 1/4 , cutting the yield to 7. 22% from 7. 25% . Most short-term interest rates were little changed . The latest 13-week Treasury bill closed at 6. 01% bid , compared with 6. 02% Wednesday . The bid on the latest 26-week bill edged up to 6. 03% from 6. 02% . Several new corporate issues were offered to investors yesterday . These included a $200 million offering of 9 1/4% debentures by BP North America Inc . Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley &; Co. priced the issue at 97. 625 to yield 9. 49% to maturity in 30 years .
