The nation 's foremost opponent of environmental neglect and genetic engineering is waving a $20 bill as he makes a bet . The scene happens to be a meeting of the Humane Society in Houston , but the wager , which is part of his script , could just as easily be offered to a gathering of born-again environmentalists in Aspen , Colo. ; at the Los Angeles home of TV producer Norman Lear ; or on a college campus . Jeremy Rifkin bets that no one can answer this question : " What value has emerged in the past 100 years as our most dominant value , a value that is the key to our science ? " <P> He rarely loses , not because the answer is so obscure but because it 's so obvious . At an easel , he writes his answer , leaving the word to hang like a biohazard warning sign : EFFICIENCY . " Everything is efficient , " he says . " We 're so skewed toward efficiency that we 've lost our sense of humanity . What we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred . " <P> Rifkin 's performance , which he delivers on average 90 times a year , is a mixture of Jimmy Swaggart , Phil Donahue and Werner Erhard . Twenty years of teaching , preaching and raising consciences  --  some would call it rabble- rousing  --  have refined this show to the point that it has a slick , thoroughly professional sheen . Rifkin moves through an audience as if it were his private party , talking , interviewing , questioning and , occasionally but ever so kindly , embarrassing . He will perform for 30 minutes or eight hours , depending on the contract . His basic sermon is an attack on " the Boys , " as he calls Francis Bacon , Rene Descartes , Isaac Newton , John Locke and other architects of efficiency . And the Boys ' great sin ? To have created an atmosphere that allows scientists to impose untested new technologies on society without considering their broader implications . Says Rifkin : " Faster is not necessarily better . " <P> It 's a wonderful performance , but in the sour view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Rifkin is a Luddite , whose opposition to DNA research is based on skewed science and misplaced mystical zeal . Geneticist Norton Zinder of New York City 's Rockefeller University calls him a " fool " and a " demagogue . " In a scathing 1984 review of Algeny , one of Rifkin 's nine books , Harvard 's Stephen Jay Gould wrote that it was " a cleverly constructed tract of anti-intellectual propaganda masquerading as scholarship . . . I do n't think I have ever read a shoddier work . " <P> To Rifkin , such criticism is merely evidence that he is on the right track . " My job , " he says , " is to point out some of the problems that might arise with new technologies . Scientists should show us how these new technologies work . Then society , not scientists , should decide if it wants to use them . Scientists are not gods ; they 're just technicians . They 're just human beings , with all the good and bad intentions of everyone else . If you criticize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utopia . But there has to be both sides . "
