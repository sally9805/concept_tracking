The President-elect talks about how he will set the U.S. on a new course <P> In the first broad-ranging interview that he has given specifically to discuss plans for his new Administration , Ronald Reagan talked with TIME Senior Correspondent Laurence I. Barrett , who has been with him for ten months of the campaign . Here are the plans and hopes of the next President . <P> Q. You are the first certified conservative sent to the White House in more than 50 years . Do you think this represents a basic political change in the country ? <P> A. I have to believe there has been a change . I think it was a change based on the discovery that some of the nostrums that were administered under the name of liberalism were not doing the job . <P> Q. Do you think you can achieve a fundamental change in direction of the Government ? <P> A. Yes , I do . The people have made it evident that they want that change . And when that happens , I think that even Congressmen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they themselves are in the market for new approaches to solve problems . Basically , I want to change the course we 've been on in which Washington was seen as the answer to all the problems . I want to restore the balance between the different levels of government that has been so distorted in these recent decades . I would like to restore functions that properly belong at different levels of government to those levels ; and restore also the taxing authority that has been preempted , turn much of it back to local government and state government . <P> Q. What will be your top priorities once you are in office ? <P> A. I have appointed a number of task forces that are working right now to carry out the transition . But I would like immediately to get into the things that I think could begin to turn the economic situation around , such as elimination of excessive and unnecessary regulations . I would like to offer some legislative proposals principally aimed at the economy-including tax proposals . And start work on reducing the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is issue an Executive order putting a freeze on the hiring of employees to replace those who leave Government service . <P> Q. What procedures will you use to select the key members of your Administration ? <P> A. We will have a committee of people who are not only qualified to judge the accomplishments of possible appointees , but who also could have some clout in recruiting them for the Government . My basic rule is that I want people who do n't want a job in Government . I want people who are already so successful that they would regard a Government job as a step down , not a step up . I do n't want empire builders ; I want people who will be the first to tell me if their jobs are unnecessary . Out there in the private sector , there 's an awful lot of brains and talent in people who have n't learned all the things you ca n't do . <P> Q. So there will be some surprising choices ? <P> A. Yes , there will be a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet ? <P> A. I think so . Yes . <P> Q. Are there Democrats of sufficient stature and in sufficient agreement with you to handle the Pentagon or the State Department ?
