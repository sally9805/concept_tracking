For souls it is death to become water , for water it is death to become earth ; from earth water comes-tobe , and from water , soul . A man when he is drunk is led by an unfledged boy , stumbling and not knowing where he goes , having his soul moist . A dry soul is wisest and best . ? Heraclitus of all the things that happened on my last binge before I went into Alcoholics Anonymous , I remember clearly only one : a powerful , somewhat surprising surge of fellow feeling for a couple standing next to me at a Manhattan bar . The bar was not one of my favorite watering holes . I had none by that time , not much caring where I drank or with whom . But this place was more familiar than most , filled with an ill-assorted crowd of professional people , Hispanics , street people , and the odd preppie . The couple , too , seemed haphazardly matched , and it was evident that before this moment they had never spoken to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beret and wispy chin whiskers . A law school textbook lay open beside his beer . She was drinking spritzers : a woman in her late twenties , in tweeds , and with plain gold hoops in her earlobes . She was white and , as I subsequently overheard , of Irish descent . They were making friends , talking about their ancestors , and it came out that one of his great-great-grandfathers had been a shipcaptain on the Liverpool ? West Indies run . And so , miraculously , had one of hers . Alas , they could n't prove the link beyond a doubt , for the law school student could not remember his ancestor 's last name . But I remember how delighted they were to establish the possibility of one , and how their joy touched off something like it in me , their secret sharer .

Wentworth and Flexner 's Dictionary of American Slang has to resort to an appendix to cover them all . There are 3I3 words in it . Most of us could add one or two of our own to the collection . l like misjudged , for example : a splendid equivocation by which the drunk manages to suggest that he has merely underestimated the potency of the liquor , or that his behavior is being sadly misunderstood . At any rate , the clear implication of this vast vocabulary is that drunkenness is the most verbal of human conditions ? until it becomes the most unspeakable . What intrigues me is the allusion that so many of these words make to the liquidity of drunkenness . We drunks are all sailors , stumbling and reeling from tavern to tavern . But to us it is the world that totters and plunges . Nothing stands still for us , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . Everything spins ? the faces of friends , the bar , the streets , the bushes in the front yard , the stairs , the toilet , the bed . A drunk 's world is hopelessly fluid , now rocking us gently , now breaking over us with blind and cruel force . Perhaps my fascination with the liquidity of drunkenness is idiosyncratic . It certainly does n't seem to be shared by my fellow drunks in AA . At a meeting once , I tried to convey a sense of my drinking career by comparing it to a salmon 's epic voyage to the spawning pool . " I drank like that fish swam , " I said . I told them how I dived into the tumbling waters with fervor and rose in glory . What was my quest ? It was infraverbal , instinctual . And when I got there , where the waters were still and warm , I found a dreamy breeding ground of the self , with the bright air just above , attainable ( was n't it ? ) by a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool , it seemed that my flesh was flaking off and floating away before my eyes , until at last I was all nerves and eyesight , staring into the fireplace , drinking Gallo from a gallon jug , trying to remember or forget , neither of which I could do , and weeping into my glass . It seemed a terrific analogy when I launched into it at the meeting , almost a fable . But long before I reached the spawning pool I sensed that many of my fellow alcoholics had gone onto a different wavelength , and thereafter 1 kept my story plain . An analogy is a way of fishing for the unfamiliar , of catching it on the hook of the familiar . But nothing about drunkenness is unfamiliar to the people at an AA gathering . They want only to have the familiar made vivid , sharp , personal , immediate . They want concreteness : the kind of booze , the names of bars , what your wife said then , what the cop looked like , how much , when , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was tell stories , if only to ourselves . Drinking , we built ourselves a drunk 's ladder of words , one end propped on clouds , the other floating on water . The whole ladder is important if you would understand drunkards , but the fluid footing is where you begin to understand AA . The fellowship exists to ground the drunk 's ladder on solid earth , on common ground , and whether we extend one end of it back up into the heavens or simply lay it down to bridge the chasms between ourselves and others , it is still made of words . which everyone has heard and spoken : Ivy nerves are bad tonight . Yes , bad . Stay with me . Speak to me . Why do you never speak ? Speak . The ground rules differ from meeting to meeting . Some are for alcoholics only , others for anyone at all . Some are " beginners ' meetings , " but because beginners often tell the most touching and dramatic stories , and because veteran alcoholics want to keep their memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobriety than they are , these meetings are usually packed with old-timers as well . The number of people varies greatly . In New York I 've seen meetings of twenty-odd people jammed into the cellar of a brownstone , and of more than 200 crowded into the basement of a cathedral-sized church . Where I live now , meetings seldom draw more than fifty and sometimes only two or three . Twenty seems to be the average . This is a good number , to my taste , and the meeting where 1 feel most at home attracts about that many once a week . We have beginners , too , vanned in from a drying-out farm back in the hills . The format of the meeting is the open discussion group , with a lead-off speaker telling his tale , the other members following up with bits and pieces of their own stories . I always speak , whether I want to or not . I think of it as a kind of spiritual discipline : to attend to what 's being said , to keep one 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounting tension for the moment when one will be called ? Elpenor , the youngest of Odysseus 's companions , is described in The Odyssey as an ordinary fellow , not overly brave , not particularly wise , He was also the first to die , doing so even before the ordeal of the great captain and his crew had properly begun . The circumstances , however , make his name irresistibly appealing to the writer of this essay , as a pseudonym . What happened to Elpenor could have been funny , For nine long years Circe , the goddess of human speech , held the Ithacan captive on her remote island , transforming them into dumb animals , slaves of their most ignoble appetites . But then at last Odysseus persuaded Circe to give them speech again , to make them men , and to let them begin their voyage home . One whole day , before setting sail , they spent feasting on meat and wine ; then at nightfall they lay down to sleep in Circe 's great hall . All but Elpenor : heavy with wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the roof . He was still there when Odysseus , down below , roused his comrades in the morning . Poor Elpenor ! Springing up at the sound of voices , befuddled , he forgot the ladder he 'd come up by and pitched headlong from the roof . " His neck , as A. T. Murray translates Homer 's lines , " was broken away from his spine , and his spirit went down to the house of Hades . " But this was not the end of Elpenor 's story . When Odysseus 's turn came to make his own descent into Hell , Elpenor was the first of all the shades to greet him . " 5on of Laertes , sprung from Zeus , Odysseus of many devices , " he cried , " an evil doom of some god was my undoing , and measureless wine . " He begged a favor of his captain , that when Odysseus gained again the common ground of mortals , " heap up a mound for me on the shore of the grey sea , in memcrry of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . Fulfill this prayer , and fix upon the mound my oar wherewith I rowed in life when I was among my comrades . " on , then finally to hazard a link between one 's own story and another 's . The sensation , when I have said my bit , is what most of us came for , serenity , But no one is under any compulsion to speak . On the contrary , old-timers tell you again and again that one of the great virtues they discovered in the program is the capacity to listen : truly to listen , without making assumptions or jumping to conclusions , without analyzing , categorizing , glossing , or comparing ( what I 'm doing now , for example ) , but with appetite , imagination , and sympathy . At an AA meeting , good listeners become as little children listening to fairy tales , And a fairy tale of sorts is what , typically , we hear . imagine many of my fellow drunks would be infuriated to hear their stories , " true " stories recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , described as fairy tales . Yetmythical world of apprehension : peopled with witches , ogres , and tyrants , rife with duplicity , danger , evil , and death . But as the child battles through his ordeal , he - also finds that nature is in secret complicity with his struggle . Life itself wants him to survive the ordeal , to defeat his enormous adversaries , to come into his kingdom . Little people , common people , all denizens of the earth , appear to help him . And the child must let nature 's secret cornplicitors in. trust them , and with them trust himself , his wits and his high resolve . And with this access of trust , the last liberating secret is revealed : that freedom is a gift of strength , and strength a gift of going forth and suffering . The gift of the story to the listener is hope . Point for point , this is the story one hears over and over again at AA meetings . Not that anyone orders us to tell them in this form . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , that 's what they are to the listeners , and I do n't mean to belittle them . After all , as Walter Benjamin has told us , a fairy tale is usually the story of a quest , through which as children we may learn to confront the forces of the mythical world . the dreadful projections of our fears , our hurts , and our mistrust . In quest stories a child goes forth , a child much like the listening child in his secret conviction of helplessness and oppression . And along the way he discovers that the real world of experience is much like the and hope " for ten or twenty minutes . There are no other instructions : no one prompts , analyzes , jeers , breaks in to tell his own story , or criticizes . But that 's the way they usually come out , as quest stories , and one reason they do is that it 's so easy to construe the actual course of a drunk 's career in that way , The ism , alcoholism , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift , like the gift for music , but malign . Becoming an alcoholic is like winning a recital at Carnegie Hall : you must have the gift , but you must also practice . Still , most drunks take it as a disease . ) But because the disease of alcoholism goes its way in a seemingly purposeful fashion , it is a simple matter to personify it . In AA we call it " cunning , baffling , and insidious , " and having gone that far , we might as well call it the Demon . When he first appears on the scene , he is as frisky and cute as Faust 's poodle , found on an idle stroll . Later , revealed for what he is ( charming , helpful , always available at the crook of an elbow ) , he begins making promises and deals . And this Demon knows how to make a deal , how to keep a promise . The stories I 've heard ! Hardworking foremen , corporate swashbucklers , surgeons , interior decorators , bus drivers , librarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kinds of things , all of them stewed to the gills morning , noon , and night , yet never faltering on their upward climb , never losing their jobs , never falling in the esteem of their fellows . But we all lost our souls , and in the typical story , sooner or later , everything else as well : jobs , money , family , friends , health , the lot . We end up in a barroom , say , screaming a challenge to take on any man in the place . Ludicrous : we might be blowing bubbles in the bathtub . There are no takers . But out on the street , the Demon 's little helpers are waiting , a bunch of pint-sized muggers come to collect . The deal was that you hold the liquor . With the grip reversed , you lose . So begins the most crucial episode in the drunk 's career : hitting bottom . Everyone finds his own bottom . It might be on the carpet of an executive suite or in the backyard where the pints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stammer , or the bin . Wherever it is , it seems somehow more textured with the actual than anything we 've known since we first set out on this voyage . And the Demon is down there as well , delighted as always to help a drowning man . Voices reach us , urgent voices . One , heroic in timbre ( though strangely demonic ) , cries out , " Hold on ! " Another , so close ro the bottom we 're lying on that it might be coming from there , speaks in a croak . " Let go , " it says , " let go . " These voices , this site , are the drama of Alcoholics Anonymous . ? hat quest were we on when we set forth ? What was it we wanted , really wanted ? It was n't anything in particular . That was the trouble . All we had was neediness and vision , bottomless neediness and wondrous vision . Out of these we conjured a god ? the god , in fact , whose servant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said that his idolaters were legion in modern societies . But drunks have always known about that god , long before there were modern societies , for on the downward leg ofthe drunkard 's quest it is Possibility who fills the sails . Possibility , after all , is simultaneously the one great true thing ( anything can happen ) , the great half-truth ( I can do anything I want to ) , and the great lie ( I can be anyone I want to ) . There are moments of Possibility-worship in everyone 's story . In most people 's lives , however , Possibility makes itself felt as a more or less fixed object of desire , not the wind but the compass : riches , celebrity , a lively love life . The more concrete the desire , in fact , the more coherent the voyage , the story , and the " I " who is telling it . In a drunk 's story , Possibility appears as it is to the true idolater : the achingly elusive element in which we live and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , of the self . I do n't know how many times I 've heard an AA storyteller begin his story with the assertion that he began drinking to " get along , " because he was shy and ilk at ease at parties and a snootful made it easier for him . I could never identify with this until a few months ago . I was at a party , a small dinner where there was a man who I instantly realized was cleverer , more articulate , more entertaining , and more forceful than I could ever be . This would have been hard to bear under the best of circumstances , but these were especially difficult . For one thing , the hostess was a woman whose attentions I coveted and my " rival " was winning . For another , I had stopped smoking three weeks before ; this was my first foray into unfamiliar social territory without cigarettes . By dessert , 1 was in such a rage of envy that I grabbed a cigarette . ( One of his cigarettes , needless to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , too , if there had n't been another recovering alcoholic at the table . Still , I smoked , which was bad enough ; 1 smoked out of envy . Cleverer than I could ever be ? Ever ? Dear God , say it is n't so ! Say that I could if I tried . That I could if I made myself new . That I could , by some miracle , be someone else . But now , wafted onward on my nicotine afflatus , I was another man ? if nothing else , a man who had not smoked but did now . Exhaling , I could see any self I wished in the moist clouds of smoke , and a good deal less of the man I envied . Booze , I now realize , did the same thing for me . Looking back to when I began drinking , I can see that I was no different from those others who say they drank to make themselves agreeable , lovable , clever . We drank to spawn new selves , to be reborn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more highspirited ? until at last our new selves swam away and lost themselves in the darkness and silence of the bottom . If spawning Possible selves is what the drunk was up to during the first part of his quest , then " re-collecting " and " re-membering " those selves is what he is doing when he tells us about it . Recalling himself as he was , prostrate before the idol , he remembers daring great deeds and speaking resounding words . But even if he did and said half of what he dreamed , even if he was the selves he gave birth to , the lived experience eluded him , forever being dissolved in the solvent of alcoholic Possibility . God does save drunks and fools , but what he saves them from is experience . The story of a life devoted to Possibility sounds like a quest story with the ordeals left out . It 's just a haphazard accumulation of endings : triumphs or catastrophes , as the case might be ( for anything can happen ) , but completely severed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooms , then , where AA people tell their stories , there are really two dramas going on , the events recounted in the narrative and the narrator 's struggle to recover his experience , to build a new ladder of words on a firmer footing . The story emerges rung by rung , sometimes as farce , sometimes as melodrama : a situation comedy or a horror show . Often it is both . At one meeting I used to go to , for example , a rough little Irishman convulsed us with an inexhaustible series of disaster stories involving run-ins with the police , tractor trailers , frosty bank managers , night nurses in the drunk ward . He used to tell how he was cured of the gambling addiction that overcame him after he went into AA . He and his wife were at a Florida racetrack , and each had bet on a different horse . His horse , which had been in the lead , stumbled and fell . His wife 's horse , which was second , tripped over the fallen favorite and broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he would say , " a bad sign . " But farce is easily transmuted into horror . There are meetings where one feels beaten , physically and morally , by the ingenuity , the persistence , the cruelty that human beings bring to the task of destroying themselves . Again and again you find yourself saying , " Now , dear God , surely he 's reached his bottom ! " He has not . But the storyteller has . The storyteller is here now , warm and dry and safe , perhaps with a firm grip on sobriety , perhaps just digging his fingers into the beach against the pull of the slamming , sucking surf : So the end of the story is always both happy and tragic . Now , right this minute , he is in these rooms , telling his story among common people , close to the world 's center of gravity . ( Meetings seem always to be held in basements . ) But after the meeting he must go out again into the fluid world of Possibility . And out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , waits the certainty of death . In some stories , the presence of death is almost palpable . In these versions the hero hits bottom and goes into AA . The quest should move on from there , a quest for sobriety , but it does not . Instead , we see the drunkard lifting himself up from the bottom time and again , only to slip back . The pity of it is unbearable : the rehab centers , halfway houses , asylums , prisons , AA itself , in and out , in and out . These are epics , heroic and terrible . The terror , of course , comes from the hero 's willed participation in his own doom . The heroism is the storyteller 's . Telling that story , groping in agonizing silence for words , the speaker becomes an actor in his real life , the protagonist in a struggle between cynicism and trust , despair and hope , death and life , death and love ? now enacted , in these rooms , in an agon of remembrance . herapies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come by as a drink . And it might be asked , as alcoholics in AA meetings do often ask , why it is that these other therapies , psychoanalysis in particular , were never able to help them stop drinking . It 's a good question , and I think the answer tells something about the kinds of people alcoholics are . ( The question of whether we were always that kind of person . or became that way as a result of drinking , is a chicken-and-egg question , and not a good one . ) What goes on in an analytic session is quite similar to what goes on in an AA meeting . Analyst and patient meet periodically , the patient bearing his anxieties , some too deeply rooted or too painful for words , others already fixed in words ? too fixed , like a published text . The analyst brings his own experience , and in the encounter between the two , the patient undergoes a kind of conversion , or rather a series of conversions , in the course of which he works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life story . So , too , at an AA meeting : there , the newcomer learns to channel the maelstrom of his experience along the lines of a quest story . And there are parallels , as well , between the dramas played out in each kind of session . In AA there is the drunk 's mortal struggle to compose his life in words and the counterinsurgent denial of his need to stop drinking , as well as of the proffered way to stop . In analysis the drama is the patient 's painful ordeal to become a maker of sense and his fierce resistance to the analyst who can help him . But it 's just there , in that element of drama , that the alcoholic finds analysis wanting . We alcoholics are intensely social , constantly threatened by loneliness : we need to go out , mix it up with the crowd , see and be seen , perform . What can an audience of one man or woman do for us ? And we want sacrifice . Once we sacrificed 46 HARPER 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , giving ourselves to others like ourselves , we learn a new form of sacrifice , one with life itself as the gift for the giving . In analysis there 's nothing like that , nothing so dramatic : if anybody is being sacrificed it is the therapist , who may be dying of boredom . But he is being paid fot it , which rather spoils the fun . Considered as theater , moreover , psychotherapy in general ( as a drunk might say ) is pretty small beer . AA theater , by contrast , is primitive stuff , as primal as the quest story . Sophocles ' Oedipus is what we want ; Freud 's is too refined , too limited . Lacking experience , and in that sense childlike , we like our theater crude and dirty and full of miracles . But we also like it formal . If a psychotherapeutic treatment has any form , it 's usually apparent only to the therapist , and not necessarily even to him . The AA drama seems as simple and straightforward a container of meaning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for containing is precisely what it must do for us . We are the incontinent , those whom Dante found wallowing in putrid slop , and what we crave is integrity , coherence , simplicity . AA drama is oral , preliterate . In fact , the whole culture of AA is oral , a tribal culture which gets passed on by means of stories and maxims . There 's an AA maxim for every contingency : Count your blessings , One day at a time , Easy does it , Live and let live , First things first . The beginner finds them stupefyingly banal . Then he learns that they are nothing more than condensed stories waiting to be brought to life by his own experience . Some of our tribes even have bards . I think of Ted , a regular at some of the meetings I go to . The first time I heard him speak I thought the Ancient Mariner had grabbed me by the arm . His voice rumbles along the edge of a cough and his story emerges with the heat and power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his youth to the horrors of a bin for the criminal . ly insane . In his story Ted is always moving , stumbling from bar to bar , from doorway to alley to flophouse , from courthouse to prison , always on foot . Fondly , wryly , he ticks off the names of the bars , their proprietors , their regulars . Sober now , on the upward curve , he is still moving , still on foot . " You 've all seen me , have n't you ? " he says . Everyone has . Once a month , perhaps , they catch a glimpse of him , day or night , walking with his easy stride from town to town along the shore road . He is walking to meetings mostly , and now in his story he names the meetings , recalls anecdotes he 's heard at them , laments the dead , sings the praises of those members who stopped and gave him a lift . Sometimes he 'll fix the date of an incident by something he read in the papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Ted , or the night they had that terrible fire up in Galahanty . " Ted is a mvthmaker . In the usual fair ? - tale quest , the only name you hear is that of the hero ( " I 'm Susan , and I 'm an alcoholic " ) , a name so rudimentary that every individual can identify with it . And the action of these stories takes place anywhere , somewhere in such and such a kingdom , but really in the good listener 's head . Myth , however , occurs in historical time , in a real country , among real people , and the men and women of myth are the real heroes of that country and people . A myth is constitutive : it makes for a collective identification . That 's what Ted 's stories do . They weave a magic circle of words around our meetings , making a tribe out of a group of lonely quest-heroes . In his own story , Ted is Odysseus ; but in his manner of telling it , he is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched and glorious as the powers of speech , for us to identify with , to be at one with , to die with or to live with , if he can only go on telling his story . else , but my background had helped , too . Where l come from , all the actualities and potentialities of being human are parceled out to disciplined licensees : mind to the philosophers , psyche to the psychologists , language to the linguists , and so on . Spirit , according to this scheme of things , belonged to the religionists , the devotees of a god , and my spirit 's experience at the hands of religionists had been uniformly depressing . AA did nothing at first to disabuse me of this . It is true that when I went into AA I miraculously rediscovered my spirit . But for a great many days thereafter , I could not have told you what I meant by the word . Spirits ( as in " high spirits " ) got at part of it . So did morale . Yet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I spoke it , some dead spot of failed resonance when I heard it spoken , where there should have been , though I hardly knew why , a full and joyful understanding . My difficulty lay in my laggard belief that spirit had to have something to do with religion , that it had to be in the most conventional sense transcendent , that it had to be somehow always straining upward , higher than man , toward God . Most AA people have no difficulty with these thoughts . Like nine-tenths of their fellow Americans , they are happy to declare ( to pollsters , for example ) that they believe in God and that their God is in some sense a higher power . At meetings , " Higher Power " is the way God is most frequently referred to : " My Higher Power , whom I choose to call God . " The locution is tactfully existential . Still , at first I could never hear that word , God , without the abyss opening up just beneath my heart . There is no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Judeo-Christian one ; and neither is there any question about what this power , this high god , does for me . He gives me the jitters . He 's bad for my nerves , the affliction with which I went into AA in the first place ; and speech between us is quite impossible . But the interesting thing is not only that I had difficulty getting the word spirit to sound right in my mind and heart . It is also that no one in AA has ever attempted to " help ' me by pointing the way to his notion of God . Never , for example , have I heard anyone in AA refer to Jesus Christ . This is astonishing , for most AA people are Christian ( like most Americans ) . Moreover , Jesus ' " story " has some rather close parallels to the typical AA story . Surely the drunk 's agony of remembrance is also an atonement ; surely , too , the first leg of his quest is a descent into death , the second a transfiguration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this only goes to show that the Crucifixion is not our only passion play , but a model , so to speak , of the genre . But I am not a Christian , and Christians , I should have thought , might find the temptation almost irresistible to call upon the story of Jesus ' Agony and Resurrection to illuminate , perhaps to confirm , their own . But in AA they never do . They never speak of it . 1:11 The reason , when I found it out , revealed to me what had been missing in my sense of the spirit that moves in AA . One day 1 took a friend of mine , a poet , not an alcoholic , to a meeting in New York . Its a meeting that attracts a large contingent of theater people , which probably accounts for its being especially emotional , even for AA . I thought my friend would be amused and moved . At the same time , I was a little afraid of what he might say . He is a man whoSe language is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision of his friends . He is also an agnostic , and these two qualities gave me pause . My hold on sobriety was then even more feeble than it is now ( I 'd been " in " for less than a month ) , and I was high , rapturously high , on AA , and felt I could take no criticism of it . I thought my friend might despise the wild groping for words he 'd hear from these people , and scorn the trite maxims by which we all tried to live . And I thought he 'd be embarrassed by all those references to " my Higher Power , whom I choose to call God . " In the event , my fears proved groundless . For it was the talk that most touched my friend : the stories told in the diction of suffering , the eloquence of shared experience , the rhetoric of hope against hope . In the taxi on the way back to his apartment he said , " The talk of God ? Well , what moved in that room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . " And it was then I began to see that the true spirit of these rooms is the spirit of human life ; a thing godlike , perhaps , but not transcendent ; not " high " ; a thing altogether human . In AA we dry moist souls on the logos , the Word .
