In testimony before the House Banking Committee , regulators who urged in 1987 that the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association be closed said they had been shocked at the decision by the top savings industry regulator , M. Danny Wall , to delay for more than two years . The failure has possibly been the most expensive thus far , costing the Government more than $2 billion. // Alvin Smuzynski , a deputy director under Mr. Wall , who is director of the new Office of Thrift Supervision , accused the witnesses of spreading misleading information , particularly about the delays in acting on Lincoln , which is now operated by the Federal Government . In an interview after the hearing , he said , " There was almost nothing that was said that I agree with or that I thought had the proper spin put on it. " // In recent days , there have been new accusations concerning the the savings institution based in Irvine , Calif. , as well as reports of a criminal investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and an inquiry by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common Cause , a lobbying group , has asked the Senate ethics committee to look into contributions by Charles H. Keating Jr . , Lincoln ' s former owner , to five senators who met with Federal regulators on his behalf in April 1987 . <> <> Unusual Politics // The hearings today , the second in a series of weekly sessions on Lincoln , shed light on the particularly unusual situation of one chamber of Congress aggressively investigating activities that could implicate members of the other. // Representative Henry B. Gonzalez , a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Banking Committee , has not been timid about investigating the ties to Lincoln of the five senators , four of whom are from his party . They are Democrats Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and a Republican , John McCain of Arizona. // But Mr. Gonzalez ' s principal target seems to be Mr. Wall . He again declared today that Mr. Wall should step aside at least until the hearings are completed. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was inappropriate for lawmakers to call for the director ' s resignation , particularly since only " one side of the regulatory story was heard. " // The most notable disclosure today was evidence that Lincoln officials wiretapped regulators who were examining records at the Irvine office . California state regulators turned over documents showing that a private detective hired by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , after the Federal agency took control of the institution , found last April that Lincoln had tampered with its phone lines to eavesdrop on regulators working out of its office . <> <> Photos of the Tap // Representative Gonzalez distributed a confidential memo from the private investigators , including photographs of the listening device . The document also said that when investigators returned to the institution two days after the device was discovered , they noticed that had been removed. // " Apparently , the phone lines were tampered with in a manner that allowed many of the employees of Lincoln to eavesdrop on the most confidential calls , " Mr. Gonzalez said. // The documents show that the F.D.I.C. referred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigation , but Federal officials said they did not know why a private firm conducted the original search. // California regulators told the panel today that they had suspected that their conversations were being monitored . <> <> ' We Were Wary ' // " We had felt there was special intelligence that Lincoln executives seemed to have , " said William Davis , deputy commissioner of the California State Department of Savings and Loans . " And we were wary . In fact , if there was some special communication that we wished to make to our examiner on the telephone , we would ask them to leave the premises and call us on a pay phone. " // William J. Crawford , commissioner of the California agency , said of Lincoln officials : " They seemed to know what we were thinking . When we ' d bring something up , they ' d have the answer ready . We wondered how they were able to provide the answer so fast. " // Mr. Gonzalez said of the wiretapping evidence , " It ' s in keeping with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eavesdropping , William Black , the acting counsel in the thrift office ' s regional office in San Francisco , told the committee that he suspected that someone within the office , formerly called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , had leaked confidential information to Lincoln. // Mr. Black said the possibility of " a mole in the bank board " was discussed . The apparent leaks , he added , " were extraordinarily harmful to the bank board. " // In what he described as yet another attempt by Lincoln to influence regulators , Mike Patriarca , the supervisory agent in the San Francisco regional office , said his wife , Laura , who was a lawyer in the thrift office , was informally approached about a job with the American Continental Corporation , Lincoln ' s parent company. // Mr. Patriarca described his wife ' s conversation with a representative of Continental as a " very preliminary discussion that got absolutely a cold reception. " // Mr. Davis told the committee that an aide to Mr. Cranston made calls to California regulatory officials as recently as last March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln before it was seized . Mr. Crawford said a similar call was made by Mr. DeConcini . Political Contributions Regulators also told the committee of Mr. Keating ' s success in assembling the five senators , - who on at least two occasions intervened with Federal regulators on Lincoln ' s behalf . All five have received political contributions from Mr. Keating. // Mr. Patriarca recounted that he attended a meeting in 1987 with the five senators and said , " They were the ones giving the answers ; they were not the ones looking for the answers. " //
