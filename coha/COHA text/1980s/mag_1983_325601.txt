Foreign policy worries mount <P> As a presidential campaign draws near , every U.S. Administration makes an extra effort to produce some evidence of progress in dealing with its main foreign policy difficulties . But for the Reagan Administration , the rest of the world is proving decidedly uncooperative . The Administration , indeed , seems trapped in a period of what might be called circular frustration : policymakers go round and round on the same old problems . <P> On the central issue , relations with the Soviet Union , there has been what one top diplomat called " a whiff or two of movement " from Moscow of late . But the movement seems isolated in such secondary areas as a human rights agreement at the marathon conference in Madrid ( see WORLD ) . In the far more important arena of nuclear-arms talks , new details of a Soviet proposal seemed to emphasize rather than ease a continuing deadlock . In the Middle East , U.S. diplomacy has stalled severely . Late last week the White House had not even received official confirmation that Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Washington next week . In Central American policy the Administration , snubbed in an effort to open negotiations with the leftist guerrillas in El Salvador , is concentrating instead on negotiating with its Democratic opposition in the House , so far with uncertain prospects . The troublesome details : <P> U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS . In the Geneva Strategic Arms Reduction Talks ( START ) , the Soviets filled in some numbers on the limits they would accept on particular categories of nuclear weapons in order to carry out a 20% cut in overall numbers of missiles and bombers that they had proposed earlier . Key figure : the U.S.S.R. would reduce its force of intercontinental land-based , multiple-warhead missiles to 700 , from the 820 it is permitted under the unratified SALT II treaty . <P> On close examination , however , the Soviet proposal amounts to little flexibility . The U.S. has been pressing for deep cuts in heavy land-based missiles . But the Soviet proposal would allow Moscow to keep all of its SS-18 and SS-19 monsters , the two heaviest classes of missiles that Washington fears most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of START unless the U.S. cancels the deployment of Pershing II and cruise intermediate-range missiles in Western Europe that is to begin in December , and to take military " countermeasures . " British experts believe that this could mean the stationing of Soviet cruise missiles in East Germany , Czechoslovakia and Hungary . <P> Stymied at Geneva , the U.S. has been seeking other talks with the Soviets . Secretary of State George Shultz , in a recent memo to the President , argued that expanded contacts could now be pursued , since Reagan 's military buildup had put him in a position to negotiate from strength , and that failure to seek better relations with Moscow would only enhance Reagan 's reputation as a dangerous hardliner . Visiting with the President in Washington last week , West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher reiterated the enthusiasm of Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who met with Soviet President Yuri Andropov in Moscow two weeks ago , for a U.S.-U.S.S.R. summit .
