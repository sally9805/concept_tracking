txt // adopted Saussure 's structural methodology to establish his own brand of anthropological structuralism . " LeviStrauss stressed the importance of phonology and the study of sound patterns in revolutionizing linguistics ' and extended its methodology to the study of myths and social institutions . He claimed : " Phonology can not help but play the same renovating role for the social sciences that nuclear physics , for example , played for the exact sciences . " 19 Phonology is the study of the relation between sounds . It begins with the study of phenomena consciously perceived by a speaker and moves to its " unconscious infrastructure . " Phonology seeks to identify systems of sound relations which are essentially unconscious . From Saussure 's linguistic structures , Levi-Strauss proceeded to analyze kinship systems as instances of the structures of the unconscious . Such " infrastructures " he saw as imposing form on social institutions . In Structural Anthropology ( 1958 ; English ed. , 1967 ) Levi-Strauss writes : If , as we believe to be the case , the unconscious activity of the mind consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fundamentally the same for all minds ? ancient or modern , primitive or civilized ( as the study of symbolic function , as expressed in language , so strikingly indicates ) ? it is necessary and sufficient to grasp the unconscious structure underlying each custom in order to obtain a principle of interpretation valid for other institutions and other customs . ' " Levi-Strauss 's move was to shift the anthropological perspective from an emphasis on substance to an emphasis on relations . Pure relationships in the unconscious , Levi-Strauss contends , give form and define social institutions . The ultimate concern of structural anthropology is with " the unconscious nature of collective phenomena . " 21 One would expect that an anthropologist in search of the collective unconscious structures of the human psyche // would find support in Jung 's anthropological work . In 1962 , however , Levi-Strauss summarily disposes of Jung 's basic concepts . In The Savage Mind he writes : These observations seem to make it possible to dispose of theories making use of the concepts " archetypes " or " collective unconscious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be common.22 In Elements of Semiology ( 1964 ; English ed. , 1967 ) , Roland Barthes outlines Levi-Strauss 's major theoretical contributions to anthropology as if the shift to a " symbolic function " was an original insight : Levi-Strauss . . . states that it is not the contents which are unconscious ( this is a criticism of Jung 's archetypes ) but the forms , that is , the symbolic function . This idea is akin to that of Lacan , according to whom the libido itself is articulated as a system of significations , from which there follows , or will have to follow , a new type of description of the collective field of the imagination , not by means of its " themes " , as has been done until now , but by means of its forms and its functions.23 Criticism of Jung 's archetypes ( erroneously construed as " contents " or substances ) helps preserve some originality for Levi-Strauss 's " infrastructures " ( unconscious structures without content ) as well as Lacan 's " collective field of the imagination " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jung here , either through misreading or through a desire to be uncontaminated by Jungian ancestry . In describing the archetype as the formal components of the psyche , Jung writes as early as 1935 : It is necessary to point out once more that archetypes are not determined as regards their content , but only as // regards their form and then only to a very limited degree . A primordial image is determined as to its content only when it has become conscious and is therefore filled out with the material of conscious experience . Its form , however , as I have explained elsewhere , might perhaps be compared to the axial system of a crystal , which as it were , preforms the crystalline structure in the mother liquid , although it has no material existence of its own . . . The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal , nothing but a facultas praeformandi.24 Jung 's description of the formal relationships in the unconscious antedates Levi-Strauss 's Structural Anthropology by nearly fifteen years ! Nor have these ambitious claims for Levi-Strauss , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In " The Influence of Jung on the Work of LeviStrauss , " Eugene D'Aquili documents the development and publication dates of the core ideas of Jung and LeviStrauss and shows that Jung consistently precedes LeviStrauss by ten to twenty years with identical formulations . D'Aquili asks in bewilderment how Levi-Strauss could so often be ignorant of Jung 's writings only later to develop the same theoretical position himself . " That Levi-Strauss was ignorant of it , especially when he presents an essentially identical position in the context of a critique of Freud , stretches one 's credulity . " 2 ' In tracing the genealogy of Levi-Strauss 's ideas and the subsequent course of French structuralism , most historians of anthropology emphasize the influence of Mauss and the Prague school of linguistics . " What D'Aquili attempts to demonstrate is that between the initial influence of Mauss and Durkheim and Levi-Strauss 's subsequent development of a structural anthropology based upon the Prague linguistic model there seems to have been an essential , although unacknowledged , transitional phase involving Jung 's theoretical constructs . // The two major theoretical constructs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of universal structural laws of the mind ( " infrastructures " ) and ( 2 ) the antinomous or binary nature of human thought . We noted above the similarity between Jung 's and Levi-Strauss 's structural approach to the psyche , so let us now turn to the notion of binary opposition . In The Savage Mind ( 1962 ) , Levi-Strauss suggests that the basic function of the unconscious psyche is to structure percepta into contrasting pairs , and that psychodynamics involves the subsequent demand for resolution of these antinomies . Historians have traced the origin of Levi-Strauss 's binary notion to the division of " Self-Other " presented on a societal level by Mauss in The Gift and to the linguistic concept of " contrasting pairs " developed by the Prague school.27 D'Aquili suggests that , while Levi-Strauss may have first been introduced to the concept of binary opposition by way of Mauss and the Prague school , his later psychologization of binary opposition into a theory of the antinomous nature of human thought was derived directly , again unacknowledged , from Jung 's concept of endopsychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jung 's theory of endopsychic antithesis differed from the oppositional notion developed by Mauss and the Prague school in that it provided a psychic means for the resolution of the opposites . This point is particularly emphasized by Jung in the subtitle of his last book , Mysterium Coniunctionis : An Inquiry into the Separation and Synthesis of Psychic Opposites in Alchemy . For Jung , the endopsychic antinomy is mediated by the anima , the interior feminine , and this interior opposition and its resolution when projected is institutionalized in society as the cross-cousin marriage . Keeping in mind Jung 's theory of psychic opposites and their resolution through the feminine , it is interesting to note that the purpose of Levi-Strauss 's The Elementary Structures of Kinship is the resolution of the " Self-Other " // endopsychic antithesis on the societal level through the exchange of women . D'Aquili points out that in Jung 's " The Psychology of the Transference " essay , published three years prior to The Elementary Structures of Kinship , the following ideas are developed , ideas that later become central to Levi-Strauss 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unconscious antinomies , the generation of exogamy and the idea " marry out or be killed out , " the genesis of the cross-cousin marriage class or section system , and the basis of the " harmonic " and " disharmonic " systems . " The following lengthy excerpt from Jung 's essay " The Psychology of the Transference " summarizes most of these core ideas and bears an uncanny resemblance to Levi-Strauss 's The Elementary Structures of Kinship , which was to be published three years later : The primitive tribe falls into two halves of which Howitt says " It is upon the division of the whole community into two exogamous intermarrying classes that the whole social structure is built up . " The moieties show themselves in the layout of settlements as well as in many strange customs . . . The names given to the two sides are particularly enlightening , such as ? to mention only a few ? east and west , high and low , day and night , male and female , water and land , left and right . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are felt to be antithetical and thus the expression of an endopsychic antithesis . The antithesis can be formulated as the masculine ego versus the feminine " other , " i.e. , conscious versus unconscious personified as anima . The primary splitting of the psyche into conscious and unconscious seems to be the cause of the division within the tribe and the settlement . It is a division founded on fact but not consciously recognized as such.29 The social split is by origin a matrilineal division into // two , but in reality it represents a division into four . The quartering comes about through the crossing of the mat-rilineal by a patrilineal line of division ( so that the entire population is divided into patrilineal as well as mat-rilineal moities ) . The practical purpose of this quartering is the separation and differentiation of marriage classes , ( or " kinship sections , " as they are now called ) . . . . In specifying the marriage classes , it should be mentioned that every man belongs to his father 's patrilineal moiety ( and the woman he marries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , he can take a wife only from the opposite matrilineal and patrilineal moiety ) . In order to avoid the possibility of incest , he marries his mother 's brother 's daughter and gives his sister to his wife 's brother ( sister-exchange marriage ) . This results in the cross-cousin marriage . . . . Nor can we assume that the primitive marriage quaternio is the absolute origin of this archetype , for the latter is not a human invention at all but a fact that existed long before consciousness , as is true of all ritual symbols among primitive as well as among civilized people today . We do certain things without thinking , because they have always been done like that . . . . The difference between the primitive and the cultural marriage quaternio consists in the fact that the former is a sociological and the latter a mystical phenomenon . While marriage classes have all but disap-peared among civilized peoples , they nevertheless re-emerge on a higher cultural level as spiritual ideas . In the interests of the welfare and development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the background so as to prevent the danger of regression to a state of having no groups at all . It insisted on the introduction of " new blood " both physically and spiritually , and it thus proved to be a powerful instrument in the development of culture . . . . Through the differentiation of the " four-class marriage system " into the eight-class , the degree of kinship be-tween marriage partners is considerably diluted , and in the twelve class system it becomes further reduced . // These " dichotomies " obviously serve to enlarge the framework of the marriage classes and thus draw more and more groups of people into the kinship system. ; " The parallelism between the above quotation from Jung 's essay " The Psychology of the Transference " and Levi-Strauss 's The Elementary Structures of Kinship is certainly remarkable ! Our purpose here has not been to question the origi nality of Levi-Strauss 's theory of structural anthropology ( this D'Aquili has already done ) , but to demonstrate a certain " kinship " between the paradigms " underlying French structuralism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplines to a greater appreciation of shared theoretical underpinnings . Both claim that the basic function of the unconscious is to impose forms ( in frastructures , symbolic functions , ; ' or archetypes ) upon content , especially myths , dreams , social institutions , psychopathology , and language . 3 Archetypal Linguistics and French Structuralism The interdependence of thought and speech makes it clear that languages are not so much means of expressing truth that has already been established as means of discovering truth that was previously unknown . Their diversity is a diversity not of sounds and signs but of ways of looking at the world . ' Carl Kerenyi THE origin of French structuralism can be traced back to Saussure 's Course in General Linguistics , first published in 1916 . Through the " course , " Saussure developed a model for structural linguistics based upon four general principles : ( 1 ) the nature of the linguistic sign , ( 2 ) the arbitrariness of the sign , ( 3 ) the distinction between language and speech , and ( 4 ) metaphoric and metonymic relations.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguistic sign , states that the word or linguistic sign unites two different psychological aspects : a meaning-concept ( signified ) and a sound-image ( signifier ) . ' The sign consists of a manifest 50 Archetypal Linguistics and French Structuralism 5 I mediator , a phonetic pattern , and a mediated meaning-concept , a semantic aspect . For example , the linguistic sign deflower consists of the signified meaning-concept " loss of virginity " and the sig nifying sound-image di:flaw r . The word unites a sound and a meaning . Saussure 's second principle asserts that the relationship between the sound-image ( phonetic pattern ) and the meaning-concept ( semantic aspect ) is purely arbitrary . ' The meaning-concept " loss of virginity " is not connected by any inner relationship to the sound pattern " deflower , " which functions as its English signifier . According to this principle , the meaning " loss of virginity " could equally be represented by any other sound pattern . In German , for example , it is signified by entjungfern . Saussure contends that the arbitrary nature of the sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because a symbol implies " a natural bond be tween the signifier and the signified , between sound and meaning . Symbolism in the archetypal sense , how-ever , does not reside in the relation between signifier ( sound ) and signified ( meaning ) , as we saw in the " flower " complex . While the relation between sound and meaning may not be symbolic , what we are suggesting is that there is a symbolic ( archetypal ) level in language that is nonarbitrary . This level does not reside in the sound-to meaning relationship , but in the sound-to-sound relation-ship . Consider the following verbal structures : // As we move vertically down this list of verbal structures representing transformations of the " flower " complex , the invariant phonetic pattern in each structure is transformed from flo to carp to viol to blo to blu to ver . This comparison of the English to the German to the Hungarian shows us that it is the invariant relationship between the meaning-concepts ( the semantic geometries ) that transcends lan guage differences and is realized in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is significant here is that the archetypal image is expressed in the relatedness of the similar sound patterns and not in the quality of the sounds as the Bow-wow and other such theories imply . It is the pure relations between the sounds ( i.e. , the signifiers : carnation , carnal , carnage , reincarnation ) and not the quality of the sound ( carp ) that carries the archetypal image-meaning . The archetypal image is presented in the acoustic " fam ily resemblance " between words , in phonetic similarities . Wittgenstein , shifting from a logistic to a phenomenolog ical approach to language , emphasized the importance of seeing similarities : What is common to them all ? Do not say : There must be something common . . . but look and see whether there is anything common at all . For if you look at them , you will . . . see . . . similarities , relationships , a whole series of them at that . To repeat : Do not think but look ! ' And we might add : Listen ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their logical definitions . The problem of multiple meanings ( " flower " , // " sexual " , " bloodshed " , " rebirth " ) becoming attached to similar acoustic images ( carp ) raises the question of what constitutes the architecture of meaning . Carn itself does not have several meanings ( as is the case in polysemy ) ; it is the link that binds together the various disparate meanings of all the terms containing carp . The meaning " carnation " is connected to the meanings " sexual " , " bloodshed " , and " rebirth " on the imagistic level through a sharing of the phonetic pattern carp . In his 1961 Terry Lectures at Yale University , Paul Ricoeur , grappling with the question of interpreting the multiple meanings encased in a single symbol , writes : A symbol exists , I shall say , where linguistic expression lends itself by its double or multiple meanings to a work of interpretation . What gives rise to this work is an intentional structure which consists not in the relation of meaning to thing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning to meaning my italics , second meaning to first meaning , regardless of whether that relation be one of analogy or not , or whether the first meaning disguises the second meaning . ' What we are suggesting is that the archetypal image shows itself linguistically in the relation between the various meanings attached to similar phonetic patterns . The various archetypally related meaning-concepts connected to one sound pattern supplement one another , not because they accidentally came to be related by sharing similar phonetic patterns . On the contrary , they became equated in phonetics because they were previously equated in the archetypal image-meaning . Phoneticizing an image does not mean simply putting an image into sound . Rather , the process involves encasing the image-meanings in a relationship of similar sound patterns . This might suggest that for every invariance in the archetypal image there is realized in language an invariance on the phonetic level of representation . // If we wish to unveil the archetypal image-meanings encased within similar phonetic patterns , then we must look to the system of relations and distinctions which carry them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important distinction between language ( langue ) and speech ( parole ) . " Language is a collective social institution that enables us to speak , while individual speaking is something we do with a certain degree of personal freedom . The difference is similar to that between Chomsky 's linguistic competence ( language ) and linguistic performance ( speech ) , between a code and a message . ' The separation Saussure makes between language and speech enables us to identify language as the appropriate object for an archetypal investigation . For language , unlike speech , is collectively stable and does not change with the egoistic style of each speaker . In other words , it is not the individual linguistic variance that makes up the language body , but rather , the archetypal invariance : the collective linguistic relationships within the human psyche . The relationships between words in language fall into two general classes : metaphoric and metonymic relations.l ? In discourse the linear sequential chaining together of two or more words forms a metonymic relationship . For instance , A carnation is beautiful is a metonymic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term in the syntagm acquires value and meaning according to its relationship with the terms preceding and/or following it . Metonymic associations are essentially terms chained together to form phrases and sentences . Saussure indicated that outside of discourse the relations between words differ strikingly . These relations are not linear and sequential as found in metonymic assoArchetypal // ciations . Rather , the second class of associations is related by the presence of an invariant element . They are called metaphoric relations . Saussure describes four types of metaphoric associa tions : ( 1 ) the radical element of the word is common in each associated term ( carnation , carnal , carnage , reincarna tion ) , ( 2 ) the suffix is the common element ( carnation , defloration , violation ) , ( 3 ) association by analogy ( carna tion , flower , violet ) , and ( 4 ) similarity by sound-images ( this form includes numbers 1 and 2 in addition to homophony ) . " The metonymic associations are based upon two or more terms present in a linear chain of words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beautiful . The metaphoric relation , however , unites terms poten tially related to a particular invariant element in a mne monic series ( e.g. , carnation , carnal , etc. ; carnation , viola tion , etc . ) . Saussure writes : " Whereas a syntagm ( metonymic relationship ) immediately suggests an order of succession and a fixed number of elements , terms in an // associative ( metaphoric ) family occur neither in fixed numbers not in a definite order . A particular word is like the center of a constellation : it is the point of convergence of an infinite number of co-ordinated terms " ( see the above illustration ) .12 The Psychic Relation between Metonymy and Metaphor The Burgholzli research into the word association process bears significantly on the psychological relation between metaphoric and metonymic reactions . As we noted in chapter 1 , Jung and Riklin designed an experiment to test Aschaffenburg 's findings that with increased fatigue a subject 's mode of association shifts from semantic to phonetic consideration . Aschaffenburg found that the more fatigued his subjects became , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus word and the more they tended to associate words according to a similarity in sound . Jung and Riklin , however , arrived at a different conclusion concerning the cause of sound associations . They believed the increase in sound reactions was not the result of fatigue , but rather a relaxation of attention . To test their hypothesis , Jung and Riklin designed an experiment to produce a distraction of attention , at the same time excluding motor excitation . The results of the experiments indicated that " no relationship between sound reactions and motor excitation can be demonstrated ; rather do we see the origin of sound reactions in diminished attention " ( my italics ) . Distraction has primarily an inhibiting effect on the development of internal associations ( of ' high valency ' ) and favours the formation of external i.e. more mechanical association ? forms , hence sound reactions in large numbers.l3 // Under normal conditions the subject associates words according to a consideration of the signified meaning-concept . However , the more unconscious the subject be-comes , the greater the tendency to associate words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ity between signifiers ( acoustic images ) . The following table is a copy of the experimental results for the first subject in Jung and Riklin 's distraction experi ments . Of the twenty-four categories of verbal responses into which they divided the results of the research , the following nine are particularly relevant to our discussion of the relation between metonymic and metaphoric reac tions . The metonymic responses are most clearly recorded under the categories " grouping , " " causal relationship , " " co-existence , " and " predicate relationship . " 4 The metaphoric reactions are classified under the following categories : ( 1 ) identity , ( 2 ) word-completion , ( 3 ) sound , and ( 4 ) rhyme . The subject 's metonymic reactions as indi cated in the table below are 62 percent under normal con ditions . External distraction reduces the incidence of metonymic associations to 10 ? 16 percent . Interestingly enough , the percentage of metaphoric reactions increased dramatically from 2 percent under normal conditions to 40 ? 56 percent with external distraction . // While the relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results of experiments on 34 subjects ( 6,800 associations ) led Jung and Riklin to conclude that " pure sound associations are repressed under normal conditions . . . there will always be a certain tendency to suppress the sounds ; the slighter the distraction the stronger this tendency will be , but the greater the distraction of attention the weaker it will be . " With increasing distraction the reaction will be more and more influenced by sound , till only a sound is associated .... The subconscious association process takes place through similarities of image and sound . ( My italics ) 1e The experimental results demonstrated the role image and sound play in the unconscious associative process and provide us with an extraordinary insight into the relation between phonetics and the imagination : sound and image . Ego-consciousness tends to associate words metonymically , according to a consideration of linear contiguity , i.e. , to , predicative and spatio-temporal associations . For example , to the stimulus word flower , a metonymic response is " grows " or " mine . " Both reactions are predicative : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; while in the second there is a propositional contiguity in the syntagm " The flower is mine . " " A lowering of consciousness , whether produced by a distraction of attention , sleep , or a psychic disturbance , is marked by a dramatic shift in the associative process from the metonymic to the metaphoric mode of association emphasizing a. similarity in sound-image and analogy . For example , the same stimulus word , flower , can produce the following metaphoric reactions : " deflower " or " violet . " The first response , " deflower , " is a metaphoric response based upon a similarity in sound-image ( " flow " ) , while the second association is produced by analogy or identity . // The psychic movement from conscious to unconscious is accompanied by a linguistic shift from an ego emphasis on the signified ( meaning ) to an unconscious insistence on the signifier ( sound-image ) . ' The ego 's habitual linguistic mode tends to linear sequential metonymic reactions , whereas the unconscious associative process is characterized by multidimensional metaphoric sound reactions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious , poetic metaphor are the linguistic lines of least resistance.19 Let us turn now to these linguistic modes in their most radically pathologized forms . The Psychopathology of Speech : Two Aphasic Syndromes " ' Did you say pig or fig ? ' said the Cat . ' I said pig , ' replied Alice . " ' " This exchange between Alice and her feline friend demonstrates the fundamental role metaphoric and metonymic operations play in language . The metonymic operation is responsible for the linear combination and grouping of words by contiguity into the phrase " Did you say pig or fig ? " The metaphoric mode of arrangement , on the other hand , determines the selection and/or substitution of linguistic terms according to some degree of similarity . For example , the metaphoric operation is responsible for the selection of the words pig or fig . Together the operations are responsible for the selection of words " in absentia " ( metaphoric ) and their linear concatenation " in presentia " ( metonymic ) . The Similarity Disorder Aphasia is classified into two different types depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation , with relative stability of the metonymic operation ; or conversely , in the metonymic operation , with relative retention of normal metaphoric operations . " The first type of aphasia , the similarity disorder , is characterized by an inability to select or substitute words outside of a syntactical context . The metaphoric mode of operation is deficient . When such a patient is presented with parts of words or sentences , he easily completes them , thus employing the metonymic operation of combination and contiguity . For example , Kurt Goldstein quotes the following conversation of a patient suffering from a similarity disorder . I have a good apartment , entrance hall , bedroom , kitchen . There are also big apartments , only in the rear live bachelors.22 When the same patient was asked to define a " bachelor " he became distressed and was unable to answer . To reply with an equational predication like " An unmarried man is a bachelor " is impossible . Although the terms " unmarried man " and " bachelor " are related in the sentence by contiguity , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the operation of substitution and selection . And it is this operation which selects " bachelor " and equates it to " unmarried man . " Roman Jakobson indicates that for the asphasic suffering from similarity disorder equational terms are viewed as redundant and therefore only appear in complementary distribution . He writes : Even simple repetition of a word uttered by the examiner seems to the patient unnecessarily redundant , and despite instructions received he is unable to repeat it . Told to repeat the word " no , " Head 's patient replied " No , I do n't know how to do it . " While spontaneously // using the word in the context of his answer ( " No , I do n't . . . " ) he could not produce the purest form of equational predication , the tautology a = a , " no " " no. " 24 The escape from equational predication based upon sameness or similarity to contiguity is particularly striking in the following case reported by Lotman.2 ' The patient was presented with the picture of a compass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphoric identification , he uttered the following metonymic response : " Yes , it 's a . . . I know what it belongs to , but I can not recall the technical expression . . . yes direction .. . a magnet points to the north . " 26 The words most likely to survive this type of aphasia are those with an inherent reference to the context as well as those with a constructive function : pronouns , pronominal adverbs , connectives , and auxiliaries.27 The Contiguity Disorder The second major type of aphasia is the contiguity disorder , characterized by an impairment of the ability to propositionize . This aphasic syndrome is the opposite of the similarity disorder and is marked by a deficiency in the metonymic operation , a loss of the syntactical rules used to organize words into propositions . The first words to be lost in this type of aphasia are those with grammatical functions : articles , pronouns , conjunctions , and prepositions . The loss of these words , combined with the disappearance of syntactical rules , leads to a degeneration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One-word sentences become the dominant form of speaking . In describing the contiguity disorder , Jakobson notes // that " the patient confined to the substitution set ( once contexture is deficient ) deals with similarities , and his approximate identifications are of a metaphoric nature , contrary to the metonymic ones familiar to the opposite type of aphasia. " 29 Persons suffering from this form of aphasia grasp compound words or word-phrases as metaphoric wholes , but can not decompose them into their literal parts . For example , the patient is able to say and understand " playground , " but is unable to say or grasp " play ground . " Along this same line Goldstein noted that the patients " perceived some words but . . . the vowels and consonants of which they consisted were not perceived . " ' " While there are many varieties of aphasia , all forms fall somewhere between the two radical poles described above : the similarity disorder and the contiguity disorder . The Speech of the Soul We have been describing the phenomena of speech pathology " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary modes of speech : the metonymic and the metaphoric . This linguistic division seems to point to a necessity within the human psyche for complementary styles of speech . The two modes of speaking are reflections of differing personalities within the individual ? the metonymic and the metaphoric , the rational and the irrational , the logical and the mythical , the ego and the soul . The psychodynamics between these intrapsychic personalities resembles a discourse , a sort of imaginal dialogue between the subjective psyche and the objective psyche , with one using the syntactical and contiguous speech of consciousness , while the other responds in the poetically metaphoric style of the unconscious . In the first chapter of Symbols of Transformation , Jung // discussed the problem of linguistic discourse and differentiated " two kinds of thinking . " ' One is described as " directed thinking " and is characterized by a logical and linear style , while the other , " fantasy thinking , " is more metaphoric and imagistic. ; " Near the end of his life , Jung carried this observation one step further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities : number one and number two . Each personality had its own language and way of articulating the universe . For personality number one , rational , realistic , and metonymic constructions were predominant , while its shadow brother , personality number two , expressed everything imagistically through a more metaphoric composition . ' Freud also distinguished two modes of psychic speech . The first , primary process , speaks metaphorically through dreams , symptom formation , and transference . The other mode , secondary process , is reality-oriented and communicates through the rational logic and syntax of the ego . While Freud starts off recognizing the existence of two differing styles of psychic speech , his therapeutic move is predicated on the axiom : " Where id was , there shall ego be . " The metaphoric speech of the soul required a psychoanalytic interpretative translation into the metonymic language of the ego . ' For Jung , however , the language of the unconscious was not a more primitive and infantile expression , but the voice of nature itself . It is a voice naturally speaking in puns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jokes . Since parapraxes and metaphors can not be translated , another method for understanding this speech is necessary , a method that is itself metaphorical . Archetypal linguistics , a linguistics of the metaphoric mode , is concerned with the language of the poetic imagination . Archetypal linguistics studies the speech of the soul . 4 The Language of the Unconscious There is no need to be astonished at the part played by words in dream-formation . Words , since they are the nodal points of numerous ideas , may be regarded as predestined to ambiguity ; and the neuroses ( e.g. , in framing obsessions and phobias ) , no less than dreams , make unashamed use of the advantages thus offered by words . ' Freud The unconscious is structured like a language . ' Jacques Lacan The Letter in the Freudian Unconscious DEPTH psychology has grappled with the theme of language since its inception . In the early 1890s , Freud published his first major book , a text dealing with the problems of speech pathology entitled On Aphasia ( 1891 ) . By 1905 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The first , The Psychopathology of Everyday Life ( 1901 ) , applied his newly developed psychoanalytic theory to an exploration of the phenomena of parapraxes : slips of the tongue , misreadings , hysterical forgetting , and 66 // symptomatic verbal behavior in general . Four years later , Freud extended his study of speech disturbances to the realm of verbal humor in Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious ( 1905 ) . The research into linguistic anomalies revealed that plays on words , slips of the tongue , jokes , and parapraxes had an inner logic of their own , a psychic logic . Verbal errors and faulty linguistic substitutions which disturbed the ego 's speech turned out to be the interrupting voice of the unconscious . At the beginning of The Psychopathology of Everyday Life , Freud refers to an incident where he forgot the name " Signorelli " and replaced it with the paralogical substitute " Botticelli . " ' While the details concerning Freud 's choice of this particular substitute are too lengthy to go into here , the importance of the parapraxis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech of the unconscious " into Freud 's conscious discourse . A similarity in the phonetic pattern of the suffix - elli afforded the linguistic substitution of " Botticelli " for " Signorelli. " 5 In 1909 , Freud published his celebrated history of the " Rat Man . " ' The clinical study extended his earlier linguistic research into the field of symptom formation and demonstrated how a person suffering from an obsessional neurosis came to associate different strands in his obsessions with similar phonetic patterns . The patient had become plagued by fears of being tortured by rats ( " Ratten " ) . Freud carefully analyzed the major conflicts associated with the " rat " complex and discovered that each of the patient 's unresolved conflicts was related phonetically to the sound pattern rat . The man was disturbed over the installments ( " Raten " ) he had made on his father 's gambling ( " Spielratte " ) debts . He also had never recovered from the early death of his sister , Rita , nor could he decide whether or not to marry ( " heiraten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' In the phonic resonance of his patient 's words Freud discovered a psychic logic . // Archetypes : The Syntax of the Unconscious In Zurich , during the same period , Jung and Riklin were carrying out experiments with the word association test at the Burgholzli Klinik . The experimental results , published in Studies in Word Association ( 1907 ) , supplied the empirical basis for Jung 's theory of complexes and his notion of the " imago . " The results indicated that in the process of psychic development , personal images and memories are built up and collated into complexes , " groups of feelingtoned associations . " This more or less phenomenal layer of the personality consists of complexes which at first seemed to be only introjected memory-images . ' The word association experiments also demonstrated that the " subconscious associative process takes place through similarities of image and sound . " ' Through their research , Jung and Riklin concluded that ( 1 ) the personality consists of , so to speak , " introjected memory-images " ( imagos ) , and ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phonetic and imagistic considerations . In chapter 2 , we noted that in 1912 ? 13 Jung abandoned the causal-mechanistic view of the psyche based upon libido and adopted instead an energic view in which psychic energy was seen as relational . The move from libido to psychic energy , from a theory based on the primacy of substances to one founded on the primacy of relations , allowed Jung to adopt a structural approach to the collective layer of the personality . Jung viewed the personal unconscious as an ineffable refuge of personal memories and individual particularities , complexes filled with the substance of a unique history , and the collective unconscious was thought to be an empty and purely formal set of structural relations called archetypes . The archetypal structures constitute the syntax of the unconscious . This radical distinction between " personal " and " collective " led to two sets of descriptions , one phenomenal and the other noumenal , and // raised all the philosophical problems concerning the relation between these two posited " realms . " In defining the archetype and emphasizing its purely formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistaken notion that an archetype is determined in regard to its content . . . . The representations themselves are not inherited , only the forms . . . . With regard to the definiteness of the form , our comparison with the crystal is illuminating inasmuch as the axial system determines only the stereometric structure but not the concrete form of the individual crystal . This may be either large or small , and it may vary endlessly by reason of the different size of its planes or by the growing together of two crystals . The only thing that remains constant is the axial system , or rather , the invariable geometric proportions underlying it . The same is true of the archetype . In principle , it can be named and has an invariable nucleus of meaning ? but always only in principle , never as regards its concrete manifestation . ' ? In other words , we know archetypes only when " materialized , " i.e. , when imaged . " The fantasy life and individual experiences of a person are syntactically organized according to archetypal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some forty years later , Levi-Strauss , seemingly ignorant of Jung 's earlier theoretical shift , proposed a strikingly similar reformulation of the Freudian topographical model of the mind . Levi-Strauss distinguished two separate levels in what Freudians had previously called the unconscious . The first level he referred to as the " subconscious " ( " subconscient " ) and the second retained // the name " unconscious . " In " L'Efficacite symbolique " ( 1949 ) Levi-Strauss carefully describes the difference between the two levels . The subconscious , a reservoir of memories and images collected in the course of each life , becomes a simple aspect of memory . At the same time as it affirms its lasting nature , it implies its own limitations , since " subconscious " refers to the fact that memories , although retained , are not always available . On the other hand , the unconscious is always empty ; more precisely , it is the stomach to the food which passes through it . As an organ of a specific function , the unconscious limits itself to the imposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the subconscious is the individual lexicon where each of us accumulates the vocabulary of his personal history , but that this vocabulary only acquires signification , for ourselves and for others , in so far as the unconscious organizes it according to the laws of the unconscious , and thus makes of it a discourse . . . . The vocabulary is less important than the structure.12 Commenting on the value of redefining the concept of the Freudian unconscious , Levi-Strauss notes : " This definition which has been so heavily criticized takes on meaning again by the radical distinction between subconscious and unconscious . ' This sentence could equally have been authored by Jung in 1913 , following his original reformulation of Freud 's model . Notice how this " radical distinction " separates the phenomenal world from its meaning , its archetypal significance . This theoretical teasing apart of the two " realms " introduces the therapeutic necessity of retissuing the archetypal core back into the complex , the noumenal back into the phenomenal . The most influential of the French psychoanalysts , Jacques Lacan , immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conference a la Societe francaise de psychanalyse introduced into psychoanalytic terminology the concepts " imaginary , " " symbolic " , and " real . " 14 The subconscious , consisting for him of introjected imagos , one 's personal lexicon , constituted the imaginary order . The symbolic order , however , had no substantive content . Instead , it consisted of a set of purely structural relationships , laws , which ordered the contents of the imaginary order . The " real , " on the other hand , consists of the actual external object of reference ? for example , the literal parent as opposed to the parental imago . This crucial distinction between the psychic " imago " ( Lacan 's " imaginary order " ) and the " real " object ( Lacan 's " real " ) was first made by Jung in his 1912 Fordham University lectures . Jung writes : Among the things that were of the utmost significance at the infantile period the most influential are the personalities of the parents . Even when the parents have long been dead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the situation of the patient having perhaps completely changed since then , they are still somehow present and as important as if they were still alive . The patient 's love , admiration , resistance , hatred , and rebelliousness still cling to their effigies , transfigured by affection or distorted by envy , and often bearing little resemblance to the erstwhile reality . It was this fact that compelled me to speak no longer of " father " and " mother " but to employ instead the term " imago , " because these fantasies are not concerned any more with the real father and mother but with subjective and often very much distorted images of them which lead a shadowy but nonetheless potent existence in the patient 's mind . ( My italics ) 15 The extent to which Lacan 's notion of the " imaginary order " reflects Jung 's early formulation can be witnessed // in the following discussion of the " imago " found in the authoritative French psychoanalytic dictionary , The Language of Psychoanalysis by Laplanche and Pontalis : The " imago " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be looked upon , however , as an acquired imaginary set rather than an image : as a stereotype through which , as it were , the subject views the other person . Feelings and behavior , for example , are just as likely to be the concrete expression of the imago as are mental images . Nor , it may be added , should the imago be understood as a reflection of the real world , even in a more or less distorted form : the imago of a terrifying father , for instance , may perfectly well be met with in a subject whose real father is unassertive . ' Lacan 's distinction between the " real " father , the " imaginary " father , and the " symbolic " father ( the law of the father ) is almost identical to Jung 's earlier distinction between the literal father , the father imago , and the father archetype . Later in 1953 , Lacan delivered his celebrated " Discours de Rome . " The lecture , published in English under the title " The Function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the manifesto for a radical rereading of Freud . Working from his revised notion of the unconscious based upon the imaginary and symbolic orders , Lacan asserted that the unconscious does not function instinctually or symbolically ( in the traditional Freudian sense ) but , rather , linguistically.18 The unconscious is the " discourse of the Other . " ' ? The introduction of the notion of an intrapsychic Other ( distinguished by a capital 0 from the interpsychic other ) is strikingly similar to Jung 's concept of the Self , the objective psyche ( which also uses a capital S to differentiate it from the subjective psyche ) . In fact , when Anthony Wilden 's // English translation of " The Function of Language in Psychoanalysis " was published , it appeared with the curi ous title The Language of the Self . Both Jung and Lacan view psychodynamics as a dialecti cal discourse between the ego and the unconscious . The interchange is described by Jung as an imaginal dialogue ( active imagination ) between the " subjective psyche " ( ego ) and the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychodynamics similarly lies " always in the relationship of the subject 's moi to the je of his discourse . " 20 The con clusion Lacan draws from his investigation into the " dis course of the Other " ( the language of the Self ) is that the unconscious must be " structured like a language . " 21 Lacan 's use of language as a metaphor for the unconscious allows the results of current linguistic studies to function as a " tool box . " Linguistic tools are employed to shed new light on the dialectical discourse between ego and uncon scious , on the psyche 's continuous " talk " with itself . For instance , the structure of conscious and unconscious rela tionships is related to " synchrony " and " diachrony . " " The " metonymic " and the " metaphoric " structures of lan guage Lacan compares to the tasks of displacement and substitution in psychoanalytic theory . " And in " L'Inst ance de la lettre " Lacan even seems to imply that Saus sure 's inverted algorithm metaphorically represents the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plies the current advances in structural linguistics to the psychoanalytic discourse , he never turns to the actual study of the language itself . Lacan uses language as a metaphor just as previous analysts had used physics or // geology , brain physiology or biology . He does not take language literally as does the usual linguist . The Subconscious Language : Thass-Thienemann In 1967-68 , Theodore Thass-Thienemann , a Hungarian philologist and psychoanalyst , published The Subconscious Language ( 1967 ) and Symbolic Behavior ( 1968 ) . ThassThienemann did not follow Lacan 's lead into discourse but , instead , turned to the field of language proper . While Lacan studied the syntactic structuring of an individual 's idiomatic discourse , Thass-Thienemann 's move was to probe for the archaic elements beneath the individual 's neurotic idiom . Besides the biogenetic inheritance , he points out , there exists another line of collective transmission , language , " not inherited through genes , but transmitted from one generation to the other . " It is the result of a cumulative process . . . . This transindividual layer may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somatic disorder , neurotic obsession , or anxiety . Thus , one is bound to perceive beyond the individual idiom the language proper underlying it . " For Thass-Thienemann , language is both medium and message , an archaic heritage ; consequently he sees no need to advocate a " collective unconscious . " Instead , he insists that " we stick to the empirical fact that the lore of our inherited verbal expressions is archaic and collective by its very nature . " 26 The language we speak , Thass-Thienemann contends , has been shaped and transformed by repressive anxiety accumulating around the focal points of organic existence : birth , sexual union , and death . Through a careful analysis of the lexical terms associated with these points , ThassThe // Thienemann explores the " regressive infantile fantasies " that have become imprinted into our languages as a result of the anxiety dwelling on the borderlines of existence and nonexistence. 27 The historical transformations from the Anglo-Saxon of Beowulf to Chaucer 's Middle English through the early new English of Shakespeare to our current English language was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives , and anxiety . The gradual change in meaning of a phonetic pattern in the course of historical development is not arbitrary . The semantic shift is the result of a dynamic process in which the original anxiety-provoking meaning of the phonetic pattern is repressed and replaced by a new , less disturbing meaning.2 " The process of repressing the original emotionally charged semantic aspect of a word and replacing it by a variety of more neutral meanings is responsible for semantic shifts in a phonetic pattern diachronically , as revealed in etymology , and the attachment of differing meanings to one phonetic pattern synchronically . " We see in this process , " Thass-Thienemann writes , " the same process that Freud called ' dream-work . ' It meant the translation of the dreaded latent content into an acceptable manifest expression . " 29 While Thass-Thienemann presents a veritable wealth of philological data , his underlying theory presents several difficulties . First , his theoretical approach is reductive , an approach which reduces the manifest meanings attached to one phonetic pattern back to a single anxiety-provoking latent meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective unconscious " in favor of the substantive notion that " language is the primary carrier of the cumulative transmission of memory traces . " ' " While Thass-Thienemann 's reductive analysis naturally results from his Freudian methodology , his sub76 THE ALCHEMY OF DISCOURSE stantive approach fails to take into consideration the major advances in linguistics since Saussure . Thass-Thienemann 's exclusive insistence on the transmission of collective phenomena historically through language neglects to take into consideration the existence of formal linguistic relations . For example , universal grammar is characteristic of all languages and yet is not the result of historical transmission from language to language ( from Greek to Latin to German , etc . ) . Theorizing that the structural relations in language ( the rules of the language game ) are transmitted from language to language is analogous to theorizing that the rules ( " grammar " ) of chess are transmitted literally from chess set to chess set ( from ivory chessmen to wooden chessmen , etc . ) . Chomsky states that the formal rules of universal grammar are innate and represent the generative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the question of formal semantic relations between phonetically related words and an archetypal " syntax of fantasy . " Toward an Archetypal Linguistics An archetypal linguistics follows the lead of Jung , Sawsure , and Chomsky in adopting a paradigm ( in Kuhn 's sense ) based upon the primacy of relations : archetypes . We do not reduce the polysemy ( many meanings ) of a phonetic pattern back to a single anxiety-provoking latent meaning . Rather , an image-oriented linguistics attempts to " see through " the surface structure of phonetically associated words for the underlying deep structure , the archetypal image , which connects the disparate semantic aspects . The more advanced sciences of this century explain the phenomena of their domains by postulating abstract , often in principle unobservable , entities as structurally reThe // sponsible for appearances . When faced with the problem of the embodiment of fantasy in language , we have no choice ? if we want an adequate theory in the most contemporary sense of the word ? but to postulate structuring complexes that range over fundamentally abstract entities at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have an account of the genesis of fantasy from " deep " archetypal structures to observed surface structures . Such an account will have to be an archetypal determination of fantasy analogous to the structural determination provided by a grammar in linguistics . Archetypal linguistics studies the abstract semantic relationship between the various meanings that have become attached to one phonetic pattern . It searches for the syntax of the mythic image absorbed in the structure of sound-associated words . Examples follow in chapter 5 . The " syntax of fantasy " does not refer to the traditional definition of syntax . In fact , we expect to find that " syntax of fantasy " is quite different from traditional grammar , as is a poetic line different from expository prose , or Joyce 's Finnegans Wake from Johnson 's dictionary . This syntax , we contend , is not grammatical ( formalization of metonymic associations in speech ) , or paradigmatic , but archetypal ( formalization of the abstract semantic relations between metaphoric associations in language ) . Here we agree with Saussure , who suggests a categorical separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand and phonetics , the diachronic , and the unconscious on the other . At the time , however , he was unaware of depth psychology or the presence of differential elements behind the phoneme . Jung 's word association experiments indicated that the unconscious associative process tends to phonetic associations which take place through similarities in image and sound . Therefore , when different aspects of the same archetypal image are realized in language they tend to seek similar sound patterns and form a complex of phonetically // affiliated words . In other words , archetypal image-meanings cluster around elemental units of sound . The core might be a phonetic pattern within which archetyp ally related meanings inhere . We work from the hypothe sis that on a " deep " ( unconscious ) level there is a mean ing-relation between certain phonetically related words . The connection between meanings is , however , not via latent sexuality ( Freud ) , or the grammar of discourse ( La-can ) , or symbolic function ( Levi-Strauss ) , or common ori gin ( Thass-Thienemann ) , but through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations is not sexual , lexical , syntactic , or etymolog ical . It is imagistic. 5 The Phonetic Imagination The psyche is the psychological correlative of the phonemic level in language . ' IN 1934 Benjamin Lee Whorf completed an essay on " A Linguistic Consideration of Thinking in Primitive Communities " and indicated in a note on the manuscript that a reprint was to be sent to Jung . ' In the essay , posthumously published in 1955 , Whorf demonstrates through a comparative analysis of English , Navaho , and Hopi languages that " no individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality but is constrained to certain modes of interpretation even while he thinks himself most free . " We are thus introduced to a new principle of relativity , which holds that all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe , unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar , or can in some way be calibrated . ' 811 // Whorf 's theory of linguistic relativity , simply stated , is that the picture of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radically organizes and biases the cosmos we speak about . Whorf notes : This organization is imposed from outside the narrow circle of the personal consciousness , making that consciousness a mere puppet whose linguistic maneuverings are held in unsensed and unbreakable bonds of patterns . ' If , as Whorf suggests , language is pregnant with unconscious patterns ( images ) , then the speaker of a particular language will be unconsciously biased by the images in his or her language . An individual will be constrained to speak to the world through the collective psychic distinctions afforded by the images embodied in language . One of the most striking features of language acquisition is that in the process of acquiring linguistic competence the speaker remains completely unconscious of the bias imposed on his or her world view by the language itself . In formally describing how a particular language structure influences the speaker 's world view , Whorf distinguishes two layers of meaning coexisting in each language . The surface level of meaning , the phenotype , is ostensibly plain , dealing with the literal lexical meanings . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of a second submerged layer of meaning , the cryptotype . The analysis demonstrated how the totality of meaning is a joint product of the phenotypic and cryptotypic factors . Whorf writes : I believe I am the first to point out the existence of this submerged layer of meaning , which in spite of its submergence functions regularly in the general linguistic whole . . . . The resemblance of the cryptotypes to the concept of the unconscious of Freud , and still more perThe // haps of Jung , will no doubt strike you , although the parallel should perhaps not be carried too far . " The cryptotypic factors discussed by Whorf are analogous to Jung 's " archetypes , " Levi-Strauss 's " infrastructures , " and Lacan 's " symbolic laws . " In postulating a linguistic relativity Whorf places the cryptotypes always in a language . For Whorf , and for an archetypal linguistics , cryptotypes and archetypes are always embodied , whether in image or sound . We refer therefore only to the phenomenal archetype . The pure phenomenalism of this position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archetypes embodied in language . Examples follow in the next section . Jung 's late alchemical views emphasized that the psychological and the phenomenal worlds are the same world : an unus mundus . ' This point is of cardinal importance , for whatever one does say about the " noumenal archetype " or Lacan 's " symbolic law " is already archetypally structured by the language expressing it . But more importantly , this means that the archetypal sound-image precedes and determines any metaphysical hypothesis of a " noumenal archetype " or " symbolic law . " Jung writing in German , and Lacan and Levi-Strauss in French , can not extricate themselves from the structuring influence of the cryptotypes embodied in their particular medium of discourse . Whatever we say about the archetypes is already archetypally determined by the structures ( " images " ) embodied in language . Hence the archetypal nature of linguistic relativity . A Transformation of Imagination into Phonetics : Dionysus The process of transcribing a dream involves the transformation of a psychic image into a verbal structure , a phonetic // script . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , from archetype to cryptotype . But what does an archetypal image sound like when it is transformed into phonetics ? How can we discover the cryptic signs through which an archetypal image , for example of Dionysus , " resonates " its presence in the medium of lan-guage ? In describing the distinctive attributes of Dionysus , Thass-Thienemann writes : The attribute of Dionysus is eleutherios , referring to the place Eleuthera on the border of Boetia , just as Athens is to Athena . . . . There is , however , more implied in this name than a simple geographical reference . The feminine complement and counterpart of Dionysus is called Eleutheria . Her name is a derivative of the verb eleusomai , a future with the meaning " I shall come . " This attribute shows that Dionysus is the god of fertility and of futurity that is implied in the seeds , that he is the eternal " coming one " .... However , although the attribute eleutheros belongs to the god of fertility and growth , it is found in Greek also with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socio-political sense as the opposite of " slave . " The coherence of these two meanings ? " the future coming one " and " free " ? hardly can be found on the reality level , but certainly the fantasies that created in Dionysus a living symbol do explain this verbal identity of the god of fertility and the idea of freedom . " This Greek phonetic word-complex ( eleutherios , Eleutherai , eleusomai , eleutheros ) " resounds " with all the distinctive characteristics of Dionysus : ( 1 ) " the future coming one " ( eleusomai ) , ( 2 ) " fertility " ( eleutherios ) , ( 3 ) " futurity " ( grammatical future tense : eleusomai ) , ( 4 ) " female sexuality and androgyny " ( Eleuthera ) , and ( 5 ) " loosening or freeing " ( eleutheros ) . But why should all these disparate meanings , // the Dionysian semantic set , have become attached to one phonetic pattern , the sound Bleu- ? On the lexical level these many meanings have little in common except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when unconsciously fitted to one another they form a network of meanings , an archetypal chain of signification , revealing the fundaments of the Dionysian mytheme . Is it possible that the archetypal image is linguistically forged in the unconscious from signifiers , words , that are phonetically fitted to one another ; that is , deriving their archetypal image-meaning from the " sound " company they keep ? 9 To test this hypothesis we shall turn to several other Indo-European languages and examine to what extent this archetypal set of meanings , the nodal points of the Dionysian mytheme , is preserved when the phonetic vehicle is transformed in the course of historical development . Does this unconscious chain of signification , the Dionysian set of meanings , exist outside the Greek language ? In Latin the verb " to come " is venio with a future derivative , adventurus , meaning " coming one . " The term developed into the English ad-venturer , the personification of the process of " be-coming , " and the temporal concept advent , " the period before the coming . " Interestingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also underlies venus , a word originally referring to " sex appeal " and later developing into the proper name for the mythological personification of sexual love . The association between " to come , " " coming one , " and " sexuality " is even more apparent through an analysis of the various meanings attached to the Latin ven-ereus : " venereal , venereous , lascivious , belonging to sexual love , and wanton . " " ' It is significant that in the above phonetic word-complex ( venio , ad-venturus , venus , venereus ) we have again developed the same set of meanings from an entirely different root than the Greek eleu- . While we have the meanings ( 1 ) " coming one , " ( 2 ) " futurity , " ( 3 ) " fertility , " and ( 4 ) " fe86 THE ALCHEMY OF DISCOURSE male sexuality , " this phonetic complex is missing the meaning " freeing " or " loosening . " In Latin " free " is liber , - era , - erum , a derivative of the Old Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek ( e ) - leuther- (os) . " The mythological correlative of Dionysus in the Italic pantheon is Liber , the god of wine and ecstasies , generation and growth . And his female counterpart and companion is Libera , goddess of fertility and childbirth . ThassThienemann notes that the Latin word lib-er , - era , - erum " carries besides the names of the deities also the meaning ' free ' ; the orgiastic Bacchanalia were called on Latin soil Liberalia , thus leaving doubt about the original implications of Liber-tas ( Old Latin Loeber-tas ) , ' liberty . ' " Lib-er , - era , - erum developed also the meaning of " birth " and of " child , " liberi , used only in the plural , in the grammatical category of prolificness . . . . The notions of " free " and " child " have grown together in the veneration of the deities of procreation and fertility . This complex idea of lib-er ( Old Latin lib-er , loeb-er ) has been acted out through the Liberalian festivals.12 The coherence of the two lexical meanings " free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of object realities . However , in the context of the network of meanings we have been developing the phonetic connection between " child " and " free " points to a deeper archetypal coherence . The mythic association between " Dionysus " and the " child " has been noted by Martin Nilsson . He writes : " The child holds a principle place in the representations of the Bacchic cult , mysteries , and myths . " 13 And Guthries further indicates that " the childhood of Dionysus is very prominent in his myths , and no other god is comparable with him in this respect , not even Zeus . ' The mythic image absorbed in this Latin phonetic wordThe // complex is further revealed through the following phonetically related words : liberalitas ( " generosity " ) , liberatio ( " a setting free , deliverance " ) , liberi , ( " children " ) , liberta ( " free woman " ) , libet ( " It is pleasing , I desire , I want " ) , libidinitas ( " lustfulness " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " a desire , lust " ) , libita ( " wish " ) , libo ( " to pour a libation , to make an offering " ) , Libitina ( " grave , death , burial goddess " ) , and librarium ( " a case for books " ) . The curious association between Dionysus and " book " is also reflected in the word liber , which the Oxford Latin Dictionary notes carries not only the meaning " free " but also the meanings " wine " and " book . " While the association with " wine " appears to be a further unfolding of the Dionysian fantasy , the reference to " book " is less obvious . And yet the association is also preserved in the Greek Bac of Bacchus which later developed into the Saxon book . Godfrey Higgins writes : " We have found Bacchus called Liber , and Boc or Book . " ' The Germanic deity Frey is the Nordic personification most similar to the Greek Dionysus . His sister-wife was called Freya , goddess of love and fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great phallophoric processions , similar to the Roman Liberalia and the Greek Bacchanalia . The underlying identity with Dionysus ( especially as presented by Euripides in the Bacchae ) is particularly evident in Saxo Grammaticus 's description of the cult of Frey . He writes that the practices were utterly offensive for the " effeminate gestures , " " the play of mimes , " and the " unseemly songs . . . sung during the human blood scrifices . " Frey 's sister-wife , Freya , appears in the Nordic pantheon as the Germanic mythological version of VenusAphrodite . This correspondence is particularly apparent through a comparison of calendar names . The Greek Aphrodites hemera ( " day of Aphrodite " ) developed into the Latin Veneris dies ( " day of Venus " ) , the French vendredi // ( " day of Venus " ) , the German Frei-tag ( " Freya 's day " ) and finally into our English Fri-day ( " Freya 's day " ) . In German we again find the meaning " free , " frei , connected phonetically with the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . In fact , the whole network of meanings constituting the nodal points in the Greek Dionysian and Roman Liberalian mythemes can again be found in the following words phonetically related to the Germanic Frey/Freya : Freude ( " joy , delight " ) , Freiheit ( " freedom , liberty " ) , freigiebig ( " generous , abundant " ) , be-freien ( " to marry , to free , to liberate " ) , Freudenkind ( " love-child " ) , Freudenmadchen ( " woman of pleasure , prostitute " ) , Freund ( " friend , intimate " ) , frevel ( " wanton " ) , and Friedhof ( " graveyard , place of the dead " ) . The Latin Libitina ( see above ) and now the German Friedhof reveal another essential meaning-concept belonging to this archetypal semantic set , the Dionysian mytheme . According to Erwin Rohde , death and the underworld of the soul were the central meanings of Dionysus . " And Hillman notes that Dionysus , Lord of the Souls , " can see through life into death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximation to the hermaphrodite is a death experience ; the movement into death proceeds through bisexuality . Death and bisexual consciousness are what Dionysus involves . " The various meaning-concepts associated through sound in the above Greek , Latin , and German phonetic word-complexes constitute the basic elements of an unconscious chain of signification , the Dionysian set of meanings , which is discovered only when the associative process shifts from semantic to phonetic consideration . Jung 's early research indicated , as we noted above , that under normal conditions a person associates words according to a consideration of the meaning-concept . However , the more unconscious a person becomes the greater the tendency to associate words phonetically.19 It is this // shift in the linguistic mode which opens the personality to its interior archetypal thesaurus , a psychic dictionary which imaginally binds together the incongruous medley of meanings attached to similar phonetic patterns . Language : The Interior Archetypal Thesaurus An archetypal study of sound-images has as its task a psychological understanding of the relation between the multiple meanings that have become attached to similar phonetic patterns , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contemporary linguistics , at both the lexical and the grammatical levels , has shown polysemy to be a fundamental characteristic of all languages . Our reflections have attempted to give polysemy and the multiple meanings attached to similar phonetic patterns new archetypal value and significance . By freeing lexical terms from the constraints of logical reason and operational definitions we open ourselves to the fullness of language , to the soul in our words . Yet we are usually unconscious of this richness , and consciousness has come to mean the narrow use of words . Freud located the " psychopathology , " or unconsciousness , of everyday life in puns , plays on words , in the deliteralization of language ? the liberation of the word 's soul through the release of the acoustic image 's " unconscious " meanings ( if we can say a word has an unconscious ) .2 ? The normal polysemy in language is restricted by grammar and syntax . Paul Ricoeur writes : All our words being polysemic to some degree the univocity or plurivocity of our discourse is not the accomplishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse , that is , of discourse which tolerates only one meaning , it is the task of the context to hide the // semantic richness of the words , to reduce it by establishing . . . a frame of reference , a theme , an identical topic for all the words of the sentence.21 If , for example , the context of my discourse establishes a sociopolitical theme , the acoustic image liberty will be interpreted to mean " the right to act freely as one chooses " ; if the context concerns sexuality , the acoustic image will be interpreted to mean " unwarranted sexual familiarity " ; and further , if the frame of reference concerns the military , the word liberty will be constrained to mean " authorized leave from naval duties . " Why , if the acoustic image liberty has many meanings , do we sometimes subjectively think that it only has one " correct " interpretation ? Or , on a more global scale : Why do I continually see the world-image ( perceive the meaning of the imago mundi ) one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings in the world ( or my words ) ? Why ca n't I see it their way ? Hear what they mean ? The results of Jung 's psycholinguistic research provide us with an important clue to this problem . The experiments demonstrated that under normal conditions the subject associates words according to both a consideration of the conceptual meaning of the stimulus word and its grammatical form ( see " The Influence of the Grammatical Form of the Stimulus-Word on the Reaction , " CW 2 ) . " Increasing unconsciousness reduces the influence of grammar ( cf. predicate associations ) and meaning to such an extent that Jung and Riklin concluded that the unconscious associative process takes place through a similarity of image and sound , not grammar and meaning . The syntax of the unconscious consists of archetypal images which constrain language phonetically ( resulting in associations through imagistic and phonetic parity ) not semantically ( according to a grammatically constrained singularity in meaning ) . In The Interpretation of Dreams , Freud also notes that the // unconscious disregards all words with grammatical functions , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their disposal for representing these logical relations between dream thoughts . " For the most part dreams disregard all those conjunctions and it is only the substantive content of the dreamthoughts that they take over and manipulate . The restoration of the connections which the dream-work has destroyed is a task which has to be performed by the interpretative process.2 ; For Freud the process of interpretation is the restoration of grammar to the dream-image , an act which reduces the polysemy of the dream-image to a singularity of meaning : Where the polysemous id was , there shall the polyphemous ego be . An archetypal approach attempts to open the ego to the language of the imaginal , to loosen the grammar and syntax which restrict the person 's " clinical picture " to one meaning : I am only a psychotic ; I am only a depressive ; I am only a homosexual ; I am only the Great Mother . An image-oriented therapy , founded on the primacy of the imagination and its inherent polysemy , works instead to free the soul 's plurivocal discourse by preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Imagistic Approach to the Discourse of the Unconscious An imagistic approach to the discourse of the unconscious has been presented by Hillman in Spring 1977 and 1978 and by Kugler in Spring 1978.2 Hillman notes that " even a single dream has polysemous ( many meaning ) possibilities which show in the . . . different interpreta92 THE ALCHEMY OF DISCOURSE tions. ' 12 ' The relativity of dream interpretation has been cogently argued by Patricia Berry in her article " An Approach to the Dream . " " Berry presents a patient 's short dream and procedes to develop seven different possible interpretations of the dream-image . She demonstrates that the analyst 's interpretation of the dream-image often results from his personal presuppositions ( causality , evaluation , generalization , and specification ) in conjunction with his therapeutic posture . While Berry is struggling with the meaning the interpreter brings to bear on the dreamimage , Hillman reverses the question by asking which meaning is the " right " interpretation of the dream-image itself . Hillman writes : Wrongness now means singleness . The constructs of right and wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyvalent one of dreams and images . When we realize the inherent multiplicity of meaning in the image itself my italics , we can not force the dream into any single truth.27 Imagistic work with dream texts involves freeing the language of the dream from the grammar and syntax which tolerate only one meaning and hide the semantic richness of the words . What is significant here is that the semantic richness or multiple meanings of a word , a dream , a person , or even an event ( e.g. a childhood memory-image ) always precedes its narrowing or reduction to a literal singularity of meaning by the ego . The illusion of a " correct " meaning is governed by the perspective , the frame of reference , developed through the ego 's narrative storying . The therapeutic process of " seeing through " the literalities of the ego 's fictions is not the result of withdrawing projections from the world , but rather the process of liberating the personality from the ego 's , or rather the superego 's , grammatical constraints . That is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the realization of a plurality of meanings in the world , as well as the multiplicity of meanings within the physiognomy of his own soul-image ( imagination ) . " The act of " seeing through " involves expanding the text or context , the story , which limits the image ( personal , world , or linguistic ) to only one meaning ( traditionally termed " onesidedness " ) . In analytic practice it is not the dream as dreamed that is worked with but rather the dream text . More specifically , it is not the complexes as such that are placed at the center of analysis , but their language . The imagistic approach attempts to release the meaning of the dream from the dream text itself , and thus reduce the influence of the analyst 's interpretative presuppositions , which limit the image 's meaning possibilities . Instead of the analyst 's presuppositions , or the patient 's linguistic superego ( the interior grammarian ) " dictating " the singleness of meaning , the dreamer 's words are allowed to speak for themselves through their inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting an arrow into the blue , Hillman explains : Not only does your arrow ? and I am addressing the dreamer ? take you into the blue , come out of the blue , bring the blues , seem true blue , and so on . But also , in reverse , your blueness comes in arrow shape , straight as an arrow , arrowing sharply . You have an arrowy blueness , and the nature of blue in you , according to this dream , is pointed , swift , shafting , feathered , straight , airborne , flying , aimed . ... 311 This imagistic wordplay has worked through two phonetic word-complexes : ( 1 ) blue , blues , blueness , etc. ; and ( 2 ) arrow , arrowy , arrowing , etc . To stay within these two wordcomplexes and their multiplicity of meanings would keep // us within the purely collective possibilities of the English language . The expansion of each phonetic complex is necessary to liberate the polysemy in the words . It is a form of linguistic amplification where the single image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the individual meaning-aspect of the dream-image is only developed when the two phonetic complexes are combined , thus remaining true to the internal relation between " blue " and " arrow " specific to this particular dreamimage : " your blueness comes in arrow shape , " " you have an arrowy blueness , " and so on . This imagistic mode attempts to liberate the meaning of the dream from within the image itself , preventing the split between sound-image and meaning , dream and interpretation , phenomenal and noumenal inherent in many of the psychoanalytic writers on semantics ( Freud , early Jung , Levi-Strauss , and Lacan ) . The traditional approach to language and dreams has been to imagine the word or dream-image as a piece of paper . On one side is the image ( acoustic or oneiric ) and on the other side is the meaning . They are eternally split and in need of lexicographers and psychologists to reconnect them . We have attempted to reimagine the sheet of paper as a M6bius strip , a strip of paper with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By sticking to the image and pushing it far enough ( to continue the Mobius-strip metaphor ) we suddenly find ourselves on the meaning side , the other side , and yet we never left the image or the phenomenal world . Image has become meaning has become image has become meaning . " In his 1946 Eranos Lecture , Jung wrote : Image and meaning are identical ; and as the first takes shape , so the latter becomes clear . Actually , the pattern needs no interpretation : it portrays its own meaning.33 // The " deep " archetypal meaning is the physiognomic and acoustic image . 6 The Alchemy of Discourse The soul can not exist without its other side , which is always found in a " you . " ' C. G. Jung Then who is this other to whom I am more attached than myself , since , at the heart of my assent to my own identity it is still he who wags me ? 2 Jacques Lacan THE intersection of two theoretical developments marks the locus of this final chapter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious meanings , and the second is structural linguistics with its discovery that meaning resides not in the phonetic patterns themselves , but rather in their combination at an unconscious phonemic level . But first let us draw together several threads that have been running through this book . The Plurivocal Speech of the Soul We began by going back and taking a new look at Jung 's early research in experimental psychopathology . Instead of the usual emphasis on complex-indicators , reaction 9g // types , psychogalvanic responses , and family constellations , we turned to his little known work on the psychological relation between meaning and sound in language . Through the word association experiments , Jung inadvertently discovered an unconscious relation between sound and image : phonetics and the imagination . The research indicated that the movement from conscious to unconscious is marked by a shift in the linguistic mode from an ego emphasis on the meaning-concept to an unconscious insistence on sound and image . Jung demonstrated that the language of the unconscious is a meaning system which collates words according to phonetic and imagistic parity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conscious personality to associate words freely , there were marked disturbances in association revealing a secondary consciousness that has nothing in common with ego-consciousness proper except a common degree of psychic reality . This realm , the unconscious , consists of multiple complexes , each capable of a partial consciousness of its own . When an event is experienced , the same event ( e.g. , hearing a stimulus word ) , at the same moment of insight , is therefore subjected to different points of view and meanings by the same perceiving subject . The ego-complex , as well as the plurality of unconscious complexes , each throws a different light on the same event . It is not that there are many different events each ruled by one perspective , as traditional phenomenology suggests ; rather , there is one and the same polysemous event ( world ) which we psychologically experience always and only through the semantically constraining influence of one or another psychic complex . It is the " shift in lighting " that produces the different meanings in the stimulus word or world . Jung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which the ego-complex is only one voice among many , produced a Copernican revolution with respect to // the Cogito and proclaimed the radical eccentricity of the subjective ego to the personality as a whole . ' The multiplicity of worlds refers to the plurality of psychic complexes that imaginally constrain our subjectivity to a singularity in meaning . In dreams these various perspectives afforded by the different complexes become personified as dream persons , our " little people . " They are the images of our " other " ( unconscious ) meanings ; more specifically , they are the meanings of our imaginal otherness . In describing the ego 's eccentricity to the other psychic complexes , Jung notes that " consciousness , which refers everything to its own ego as the center of the universe , is only one among the archetypes of the unconscious , comparable to the King Helios of postclassical syncretism , whom we meet in Julian Apostate , for example . " This is what the complex of consciousness would look like if it could be viewed from one of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The subjective egopersonality , i.e. consciousness and its contents , is indeed seen in its various aspects by an unconscious observer placed in the " outer space " of the unconscious . ' This phenomenon is particularly striking in dreams where the dreamer 's ego is viewed from a perspective entirely alien to the conscious personality . The dreamer 's ability to view himself , the dream ego , in the dream is possible only if other perspectives exist beyond ego-consciousness . The paradox of this situation arises from the fact that consciousness is both the subject and the object of the epistemological act . And it is further complicated by the fact that the ego is not the only " knowing " agent in the psyche . In dreams ego-consciousness is reflected on , " known , " from a nonego standpoint ? we experience the image and discourse of our own ego-consciousness objec-tively ! // The Relation between Meaning , Sound-Image , and Referent In Geneva during the same crucial years that Jung was experimentally working out the psychological relation between meaning and sound and his theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become structural linguistics . In chapter 3 we noted that in his Course in General Linguistics , Saussure made the essential distinction between sound-image ( signifier ) and meaning-concept ( signified ) .5 The sound pattern is vested with meaning only because it is integrated into a meaningful system of relations with other signifiers characterized by differential opposition . The notion of phonetic differentiality , which is entirely original with Saussure , has seen its fullest development in phonology . The phonetic level constituted by signifiers ( sound patterns ) is unconsciously organized into a phonemic system of unbreakable differential oppositions . The semantic level , on the other hand , consists of a selfreferential system of signifieds ( meaning-concepts ) , which Saussure describes as follows : Since there is no vocal image whatsoever which would correspond more than any other one to what it is charged with saying , it is evident , even a priori , that a fragment of language can never be found , in the last analysis , except on its noncoincidence with the rest . Arbitrary and differential are two correlative qualities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of semantic differentiality and ultimately implies a circularity of meaning . One can sense this in the dizzying effect of a dictionary : each word refers to the other words by a series of definitions and equivalents , but in the end the meaning is a tautology , without ever being able to refer to a fixed // definition outside the self-referential level . ' Saussure 's " diacritical " theory of meaning implies that there is no fixed point outside the particular system of meaning relations , no transcendental referent such as Wittgenstein spoke of in the Philosophical Investigations . Saussure 's startling claim was that the relation between signifier and signified , sound and meaning , is purely arbitrary . ' However , when Saussure talks about the arbitrary connection between sound and meaning , he speaks as a philologist , a transcendental observer of languages . An analysis from the historical ( diachronic ) perspective gives the illusion that the relationship between signifier and signified is arbitrary . If , however , the analysis is performed on a synchronic level the apparent arbitrariness is called into question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Language of the Self . The relationship between " boeuf " and " Ochs " is arbitrary , as he Saussure , p. 102 says , but since that between cognates and derivatives in various languages is not , as he does not say , it is clear that the arbitrariness lies between the signifier and " reality " ? that is , between the signifier and either " real objects " or whatever is represented as reality by the social consensus of mutually shared presentations or referents . Thus , he really means what he says when he uses the expression " the arbitrariness of the sign " as a synonym for the linguistic sign is arbitrarily related to referents my italics , which were probably conceived of by Saussure as " real objects . " ' Here Wilden is following an earlier lead by Benveniste in suggesting that Saussure 's arbitrariness does not lie between the signifier and the signified but between the signifier and its object of reference ! ' ? This clarification of the " arbitrariness of the sign " by Wilden is significant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there exist archetypal chains of signification in various languages which " pin " together the phonetic and the semantic levels in a nonarbitrary fashion . While from a diachronic perspective the connection between sound and meaning may appear to be arbitrary , from a synchronic perspective the connection is nonarbitrary . For instance , from a diachronic stance the connection between the meaning-concept " goddess of love and sexuality " and the various phonetic patterns " Eleutheria , " " Venus , " " Freya " appears to be arbitrary . When the diachronic perspective is shifted to a series of synchronic views , we suddenly discover that at each successive synchronic level the particular sound pattern ( " Eleutheria , " " Venus , " and " Freya " ) is nonarbitrarily tied through phonetic parity to a cluster of archetypally related meanings ( cf. " Eleutheria , " " eleutherios , " " eleusomai , " " eleutheros " ; " Venus , " " adventurus , " " venio , " " venereous " ; etc . ) On a synchronic level there exist unconscious chains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarity in phonetic patterns . Under normal conditions a person associates words according to a consideration of the meaning-concepts . A lowering of consciousness shifts the linguistic mode from semantic to phonetic consideration and thus opens the personality to its interior archetypal theasaurus , a psychic dictionary which imaginally binds together archetypally related meanings through a parity of phonetic values . The Insistence of Image and Sound in the Verbal Imagination Let us take a closer look at how the phonetic unconscious in language works . Both Jung and Lacan have dem104 THE ALCHEMY OF DISCOURSE onstrated the insistence of the letter in the unconscious . " Their work bears witness to the fact that it is language , not the ego , that places demands upon us ; that awakes in us literary exaltations ; that insists that we speak . And , as we do not make up language , so " we " do not make up our parapraxic response to language , but are " taught " this response by our language . Here I follow the lead of Whorf by implying that the unconscious of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we experience the " claim " that language makes upon us . For words come to us already embedded in phonetic clusters and pregnant with signification , angels which appear to instruct the ear to hear , the hand to write , and the heart to respond . Consider , for instance , the role of the phonetic imagination in the following case of a traumatic neurosis : A female patient of Mme. Sechehaye showed psychotic reactions following a traumatic event which took place twenty years ago . She became deprived of her daughter by a court ruling . She was a radically dedicated freedom fighter much like her husband who died in prison as a martyr of liberty . She suffered from the political repercussions of her conduct , the court ruling might have been one of them . She fell in a state of depression but recovered spontaneously by visiting the public library of her home town . This experience has been repeated eight times in a period of nine years . The public library became her healing symbol , she experienced this curative effect as a magic she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the substitute of the good mother she never had and missed badly . In the process of analysis she learned to shift the image of the good mother from the library to the female therapist , through this transference the morbid fixation to the library was resolved and the patient became able to work and establish normal human relationships . ( My italics ) " // The patient was " fixated " to the library , something that does not ordinarily elicit eros , and the etiology of the fixation enlists a factor that is central to our theory of archetypal linguistics : an unconscious association of meanings through a parity of phonetic values . On a personal level the patient suffered from an unconscious identification of the missing good mother and her lost child with the library , an identification that was later transferred onto the analyst and successfully resolved in the course of therapy . But why did this " freedom fighter " unconsciously associate the " library " with her missing " good mother " and lost " child " ? Is there an underlying deep structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning-concepts : " good mother , " " freedom , " " child , " and " library " ? In an excellent discussion of the psycholinguistics involved in this case , Thass-Thienemann has suggested that the patient 's associations were unconsciously structured by the " underlying verbal complex of liberty and library on the one hand , and the Latin liberi , ' children , ' on the other . " The verbal complex served as a given structure upon which the individual fantasies of the patient became attached . Liberty meant to the patient Libera in the original sense of the bountiful , nourishing mother , the library appeared to her as the temple of Enlightenment and Liberty . " It is my daughter , " the patient said , " who is in the library ; there I rediscovered my spiritual child whom no one can steal away from me . " She identified the libri " books " with liberi " children . " ( My italics ) Earlier , in chapter four , we noted that Freud describes a remarkably similar example of the role the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case history of the Rat Man , we saw how Freud discovered that the patient 's obses106 THE ALCHEMY OF DISCOURSE sions were concatenated along linguistically established lines of phonetic associations : " Ratten " ( rats ) , " Raten " ( instalments ) , " Spielratte " ( gambling ) , " heiraten " ( marry ) , and " Rathaus " ( courthouse ) .15 Notice that in each case it is not the patient that speaks , but in and through him , " language " speaks , and his clinical symptoms , in fact his very nature , have become interwoven with psychic effects exhibiting the structure of language . The patient has now become the substance subjected to the formal structures of language.16 Of particular interest here is the role transference plays in reconnecting the patient to the lost objects of desire . In the case of the " freedom fighter , " the meaning-images of the " good mother " and the lost " child " had become psychically lost , unconscious , and therefore imprisoned in matter through projection . The desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to reconnect with her lost soul , which had become coagulated in physical realities : literalized . The fixation resulted from the experience of her unconscious meanings emanating as a discourse of desire ( eros ) , from an object in the outer world . When Alcibiades questioned Socrates as to the location of his soul and its meaning , Socrates replied : " Look to your desire . " The significance of desire is in the fact that it does not originate in the subjective psyche . It is not the subject that desires the soul in the world ; but rather , the soul that longs to be reconnected with the subject . In other words , it is not " we " who solicit the soul ( our other meaning-images ) , but the soul that solicits us . Our " freedom fighter " was solicited by a radical articulation of her soul . In this particular case the articulation was not mediated through dream-images or bodily symptoms , but through a transitional object : the library . But was it the actual object of reference that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? its phonetic pattern ? Here we are making the critical distinction between the actual object of reference ( the literal library or rat ) and the object 's signifier // ( the sound pattern " library " or " Ratte " ) . " Was the patient 's desire directed towards the unconscious meanings emanating from the objects of reference or from the polysemy of the phonetic patterns ( signifiers ) ? The " Transference " of Meaning in Alchemy : " The Solution Is the Solution " To answer this question we shall turn to the practice of alchemy . The early alchemists were deeply involved on a literal level with the process of transference . They developed the art of freeing that part of their soul which was " asleep " and imprisoned in matter . The alchemical transmutation , the magnum opus , involved liberating those meaningful aspects of the personality that were unconsciously concretized through projection in the material world . The alchemical opus began with the " prima materia . " The actual identity of the " prima materia " was considered by many to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Alchemical Lexicon , lists more than fifty synonyms for the " prima materia . " ' The secrecy surrounding the actual identity resulted from the fact that the " prima materia " respresented the unknown substance that carried the projection of the unconscious psychic contents of the alchemist himself . The fantasy content of the projection was referred to as the " anima mundi , " the soul in the world ; while the " prima materia " was the substance in the world that carried the projected contents . It is consequently impossible to specify a particular substance common to all alchemists . Hoghelande , in his text on alchemy , writes : They have compared the " prima materia " to everything , to male and female , to the hermaphroditic monster , to // heaven and earth , to body and spirit , chaos , microcosm , and the confused mass ; it contains in itself all colors and potentially all metals ; there is nothing more wonderful in the world , for it begets itself , conceives itself , and gives birth to itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( image ) in the world on which , or through which , an unconscious signified ( meaning ) is " transferred . " Through a series of operations performed on the " prima materia , " for example on salt , sulphur , or lead , the alchemist actually worked on his own salty bitterness , sulphuric combustibility , or leadened depressiveness . By means of concretely physical images , the alchemist simultaneously worked on the soul in matter and the matters in his soul . Liberating the psyche from its imprisonment in natural matter , from its natural and material perspective , was an " opus contra naturam " ? a work against nature . For although the opus began with substances of nature , through the alchemical operations of fixation , condensation , sublimation , iteration , 2 " and so on , these natural substances ( external objects of reference ) were transformed into psychic substances ( internal objects of reference ) : fantasy images . Meaning was extracted from matter ; gold from the " prima materia . " The true " opus contra naturam " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective into the imaginal perspective . Transforming the literal naturalistic ego into an " imaginal ego " 21 capable of " seeing through " the material world imaginatively . But what actually is involved in the process of " seeing through " ? This question can be approached linguistically by examining its acoustic counterpart : " hearing through . " How is the literal word transformed into the metaphoric word ? What linguistic process is involved in our patients ' " hearing through " the phonetic resonance of the signifiers // " Ratte " and " library " to their unconscious image-meanings ? " Hearing Through " : The Poetics of the Soul We are now in a position to begin to answer these questions by tying together loose threads developed earlier in chapters three and four . In chapter three we reviewed the two main operational axes of language : the metonymic and the metaphoric . The metonymic functions by concatenating words into linear chains according to the laws of grammar and syntax . Through this process the inherent polysemy of the words is reduced to a singularity in meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language associates words according to some degree of phonetic and or semantic ( identity or analogy ) parity , not syntactically . Let us take as an illustration Hillman 's dream text discussed earlier in chapter 5 : " The arrow is blue . " The metonymic concatenation of the individual words ( arrow , blue , the , is ) according to the rules of grammar and syntax produced the sentence : " The arrow is blue . " What has occurred in this process , however , is that the plurality of meanings inherent in each acoustic image ( word ) , as well as the polysemy of the referent dream-image , has been constrained by grammar to a singularity in meaning . Hillman 's imagistic work with the dream text ( " Not only does your arrow . . . take you into the blue , come out of the blue , bring the blues , seem true blue , and so on . But also , in reverse , your blueness comes in arrow shape , straight as an arrow , arrowing sharply . " ) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphoric axis . The diagram below illustrates the two axes and presents a summary of the particular characteristics of each axis as discussed in chapter 3. " // By using the very linguistic mechanism employed by the unconscious in the construction of the dream we are now able to free the unconscious meanings in the dream text and poetically enrich the image . We begin with the literal word and slowly " hear through " it to its secondary and tertiary meanings until we realize that there is an alterna tive axis of being ? an unconscious poetic dimension . The main obstacle to this dimension is the habitual metonymy of the ego , which through literalism constricts the speech of the soul . Our usual ways of speech may keep us from hearing what the image is saying . And a main determinant of the volume of an image resides in the multiple implicaThe // tions of its words . To get at this volume , this amplification , we have to break through the roles assigned to words by grammar and syntax ; we must break the literalism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our sentences . In grammar and syntax is lodged the fundament of our collective unconscious and its non-imaginal singleness of mind . We are unconscious in the very instrument of consciousness : our speech.24 " Hearing through " the dream text is a process of reconstituting the unconscious intentionality of the dream . By unsilencing the polysemy of the dream 's words , we let the dream happen to the ego and in the process the dream becomes an interior therapist analyzing the conscious attitude . For the very viewing of the dream is a self-reflexive process . The ego is already being analyzed by the soul when consciousness attempts a literal interpretation of the soul 's dream . In the analytic process , when the patient is asked the meaning of his own dream , the patient 's ego becomes the interpretative " critic " of his own " text . " 2 ' It is a form of intrasubjective criticism whereby one complex , the ego , is criticizing the fantasy products of the other unconscious complexes . By interpreting and giving definition to his own dream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But who is defining whom ? Is the ego giving meaning to the soul , or is the soul giving meaning to the ego ? The interpreting ego literally sees its own blindness in the dream . While the ego provides the interpretative constraints , the psychic blindness that literalizes the meaning of the dream text , the actual polyvalent meaning of the dream is authored by the soul . Each new interpretation the ego " sees " in its " own " dream text is like peeling another layer off the mystic 's onion . What the ego sees 1 12 THE ALCHEMY OF DISCOURSE literally in the dream is that part of the personality it can not see through metaphorically . Moving from the Literal to the Metaphoric The process of interpretation begins with the literalobjective level of the dream and then moves to the metaphoric-subjective level . ' If , for instance , a dreamer 's mother appears in a dream , the objective level of interpretation takes the mother-image back to the actual person herself , the external object of reference , and the dreamer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches the same mother-image as an expression of the person 's psychic traits . She is a part of the dreamer to be integrated or at least made conscious ? the characterologic essence of motherness . Through the process of moving from the objective to the subjective level of interpretation , we have freed the polysemy of the sound pattern " mother . " The interpretation begins with a freeing of those meanings attached to the phonetic pattern " mother " which are associated to the external object of reference : the literal mother . The shift to the subjective level of interpretation now liberates an additional set of meanings attached to the same sound pattern , " mother , " and yet referring to an entirely different object of reference : the internal mother-imago . " The movement from the objective to the subjective level of interpretation is possible only because the same phonetic pattern ( e.g. , " mother " ) has dual objects of reference : one external ( the literal mother ) and the other internal ( the metaphoric mother-imago ) . The interpretation moves back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of meanings attached to the same sound pattern . // The acoustic image is the crucial intersection between the external and the internal , between the literal and the metaphoric . This intersection between the objective meanings and the subjective meanings of the same phonetic pattern is fundamental to the practice of alchemy . The " magnum opus " is a process which plays back and forth between the external and the internal meaning sets of the words sig nifying the objects of their work . While the alchemists were working on the soul in " matter " they were simulta neously working on the " matters " of their soul . And the " solution " to these " matters " they sought in their " solu tions . " Notice how alchemy " works through " the inherent polysemy of the phonetic patterns . For example , the phonetic pattern " solution " ( Lat. solutio ) on the objective level means and refers to : " a liquid substance . " On the subjective level , however , the same phonetic pattern refers to an entirely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and has the meaning " re-solution of the problem . " Z8 The interaction between internal and external meanings is particularly apparent in the polysemy of the following phonetic patterns : Why should an alchemist seek the answer to his prob lem ( his " confused matters " ) in a liquid substance ? Was he actually working on the literal external object of reference or was he working with the inherent polysemy of the signifier ? the phonetic pattern ? Is the alchemist playing with substances or playing with words ? From the Laboratory to the Oratory29 The choice of a liquid as an object to " project " his un conscious " solution " into raises the question of what con stitutes the " hook " for his projection . Is the " hook " an // attribute of the external object of reference ( the physical substance ) or of the signifier , the sound pattern " solution " ( Lat. solutio ) ? Earlier in our discussion of the clinical cases we arrived at a similar question : Was the " freedom fighter 's " fixation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " obsessions about the " rat " story precipitated by the external objects of reference or by the signifiers ? the sound patterns " library " and " Ratte " ? This question focuses on the transformation of the unconscious image-meaning of a symptom into linguistic expression and can be divided into two aspects : ( 1 ) How are unconscious imagemeanings transformed into verbal expression and ( 2 ) To what extent does the acquisition of language separate man from the material world ( the external objects of reference ) and initiate him into a shared archetypal reality : language . The answer to the first question is rooted in the relation between phonetics and the imagination : sound and image . In chapter 1 we began with an inquiry into the transformation of unconscious images into verbal structures , phonetic script . We followed the lead of Jung 's early association work , which suggested a fundamental law of imagination , that its mode of operation is sonorous and phonetic , and that there is an innate connection between logos and image . We extended this insight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and German phonetic word-complexes and demonstrated that unconscious image-meanings tend to cluster around elemental units of sound . The core might be a particular phonetic pattern ( e.g. , eleu ) within which archetypally related meanings inhere ( " the future coming one , " " fertility , " " futurity , " " female sexuality and androgyny , " and " loosening or freeing " ) . Our philological research suggests that on a " deep level " ( unconscious ) there exists a meaning relation between phonetically related words . The relationship between the different meanings is not , however , through latent sexuality ( Freud ) , or the grammar of discourse ( La1 // can or Edelson ) , or common origin ( Thass-Thienemann ) , but through the underlying archetypal image : the syntax of the imagination . The second aspect of the question addresses the problem of linguistic relativity . Whorf demonstrated that the unconscious image-meanings ( cryptotypes ) encased in our language radically organize and bias the world we " see . " Through the acquisition of language the child is ushered into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry into the collective unconscious can not be overemphasized . For in acquiring linguistic competence the infant ( Lat. infari , " not speaking " ) has to learn to speak to the world through a network of archetypally related signifiers : language.30 The significance of the linguistic matrix lies in the fact that it is a system of unconscious meaning-relations organized in advance of any individual ego.31 The child has to accept the collectively assigned meanings in the linguistic matrix and , in doing so , he becomes a meaningful entity himself within the psychological matrix of societal meaningrelations . As such his personality exhibits the same polysemous structure psychologically ( many meaningcomplexes ) that his " mother tongue " exhibits linguistically . " The acquisition of language , however , separates the child from the material world by allowing the individual to develop a system of phonetic patterns capable of replacing the actual objects of reference in the world . For instance , through the acquisition of language the " Rat Man " developed the potential to substitute the phonetic pattern Ratte for the external object of reference : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paradoxical status of a word , a presence made of an absence.33 For language allows us to evoke various experiences of an object of reference ( cf. the literal rat ) in the very absence of that object . We can speak about a " rat , " a " carnation , " a // " violet , " a " flower , " a " library , " a " solution , " etc. , even though the actual object of reference is absent . In this book we have attempted to demonstrate that through the acquisition of language , man is separated from the material world ( external objects of reference ) and initiated into a shared archetypal system of meaning relations ? a system that collates meanings imaginally through a parity in phonetic values . A lowering of con sciousness shifts the linguistic mode of association from a consideration of the meaning-concepts associated with the objects of reference to a consideration of the meaning-concepts connected through phonetic parity to the object 's signifier ? its phonetic pattern . This process involves freeing the soul ( the meaning-concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reference ) . The acquisition of language enables man to take " matters " out of life and transform them into imagination . Shifting the linguistic mode from semantic to phonetic consideration transforms the mate rial of the " day world " ( the objects of reference ) into the insubstantial poetic images of the " night world " ( image-meanings collated through phonetic parity ) . ' Matter is transformed into imagination .
