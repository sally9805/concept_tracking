infirmary wall . " It was . . . it was the monster . It 's big . Bigger than a komodo . Fast , like a racing motorcycle ! Turns better . " Sylvia knelt to look at the corpse . Terry was behind her , peering over her shoulder , and hissing in disgust . " Komodo , Weyland ? " he said incredulously . " Shit . It was sure as hell a dragon , anyway . " She had never seen a human body damaged so badly . Cadmann 's eyes met hers , and there was a naked plea in them . Please . You believe now , do n't you ? Do n't you ? " You 're hurt . You 've lost a lot of blood , " she whispered . " We 've got to treat those burns . " " Not yet . No sedatives until you believe me . " He waved one blackened hand weakly . " Go ahead .

Take it into the lab and for God 's sake analyze it . " Two of the lab techs unloaded the chopper . The package was bulky and clumsily wrapped and weighed about two kilos . Sylvia did n't want to unwrap it . " All right , Cad , " she said . " Let 's go in and take a look  --  but you come in and sit down . We ca n't afford to lose you . " Zack was watching Cadmann 's eyes carefully , chewing at the corner of his mustache . Carlos pushed his way through to stand next to Sylvia . " Carlos , " Cadmann said weakly , trying to smile . He moved his mouth as if his lips were half frozen . " Amigo . " There was confusion and mistrust mingled in Carlos 's face , and his dark eyes kept straying to Cadmann 's makeshift crutch . " We 've had a lot of trouble here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Tell me something I do n't know . " Several of the colonists had edged almost imperceptibly nearer , and the tension left a metallic taste in Sylvia 's mouth . Something ugly was going to happen . She broke the spell by clearing her throat . " I 'm taking this into the lab . I 'd like you , Zack , and Terry , and Mary Ann and Carlos . Except for lab personnel , I 'd like the rest of you to wait , or go back to bed . There 's nothing more to be done tonight , and we 're going to need clear , rested minds in the morning . " Without another word she turned and entered the lab . She did n't look behind her , did n't want to , because she did n't want Cad/mann to see her confusion . No matter what happened here , and what she found out , they had to get the rifle away from him . He was mumbling as Carlos and Mary Ann helped him through the door . " Absolutely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shrapnel must have . . . " He shook his head woozily . Hysterical laughter was bubbling up through the fatigue . " It got a mouthful all right , a real mouthful , and I wish that I 'd blown its fucking head clean off  --  " " Cad  --  " " Stay back . " There was still iron in his voice . " Cadmann , " Zack said quietly , watching with eyes that missed nothing , " Alicia is dead . Her baby is gone . " Cadmann said nothing , swallowing hard . " How . . . no .. . when ? " " Right after you left . Something got through all of our defenses . Broke through her window . We need your help . But the first thing you 've got to do is to put that rifle down .

The only thing she could do for Cadmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , orShe cut that thought off before it had a chance to take root . He was telling the truth . There simply was n't any other answer . Not even Terry had accused Cadmann of killing Alicia and her baby . There is a big difference between a calf and a human beingShe sneaked a peek over her shoulder at Cadmann . He was staring at her , eyes dark-rimmed with exhaustion , and she was suddenly afraid . " I 'm cold , " Cadmann giggled almost to himself . " A floating anvil . That 's a nice image . " " Cadmann  --  " Sylvia and Mary Ann exchanged looks . " You need rest . " " Not until you look at that sample , damn it . But ... I 'll go into the veterinary room . I 'll sit down . " Mary Ann , yellow curls flattening against Cadmann 's shirt , his blood staining her nightgown , motioned to Carlos . Together , they helped him into the veterinary clinic and to an examination table . He sat , clutching the rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need plasma , Cadmann .

" " All right , all right . " Jerry grunted relief and prepared a plasma bottle . Carlos peeled Cadmann 's blackened shirt away from his right arm . Cadmann winced , clutching the rifle more tightly . " You should have seen it , " he muttered . " If you could see it , you 'd understand . It 's fast . God , it 's fast . I swear it 's faster than any animal on Earth . Nothingcan move that fast , but it did . Be damned if it did n't . " " Come on , Cad , " Mary Ann wheedled .

" Zack whispered to Jerry just before the veterinarian slipped the needle into Cadmann 's arm , and set the control on the rectangular box of the plasma pump . It hummed gently , sending healing fluid into Cadmann 's veins . " Do n't look at me that way  --  " Cadmann 's voice was pleading , slurred and drunken . He tried to raise his head but it seemed monstrouslyheavy . It thumped back to the table . The rifle slipped in his grasp a little , and he groaned , tightening his grip . " Ernst had a bullet hole in him , Cad . We were hoping you could help us with that . " Cadmann , slipping further toward unconsciousness , did n't really hear the irony in Zack 's voice . " The monster . It was eating him . " He yawned deeply . " Must have hit Ernst . Maybe even tried to . He screamed , Zack . Screamed like a woman . He wanted to die  --  " Zack made his move , snatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short , choppy movement drove the butt into Zack 's stomach . Zack staggered back , grunting , face whey-colored . Cadmann tried to roll from the table and stand , but fell heavily , ripping the I.V . from his arm . Dark fluid drained from the needle and dribbled onto the white tile of the clinic floor . He struggled to gain his feet , make it to his knees before Carlos landed on his shoulders , pinning him down . Zack stumbled back in , wresting the rifle away as Cadmann sobbed and collapsed to the floor . " Please . Do n't . . . just trying . . . " His head sank back to the ground , and he was unconscious . " Jesus Christ , " Carlos whispered , for once his accent forgotten.  | " What kind of man is he ? How much somazine did you pump into that plasma , Jerry ? " " I did n't want to overdo it . Come on . Help me get him on the table . " Sylvia watched Carlos and Terry tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's skin creased . " Why so tight , Terry ? " " You have n't told us yet , " he said nastily . " Is that a piece of Ernst or is n't it ? " " No . " Sylvia shook her head , more from fatigue than relief . " I 've tried human antigens . It 's not calf meat , it 's not dog . It reacts to all of them . It 's not turkey or chicken , and it 's not catfish . So it 's alien . " " So he killed a pterodon . So what ? " " I 'm tired , Terry . Back off . " Her voice was numb . " Jerry  --  get the liquid nitrogen , would you ? " She tweezed a piece of the meat to a dissection tray , and sliced a quarter-inch piece away . Jerry carried over a ceramic thermos and tipped the lid . The liquid nitrogen , boiling at the touch of roomtemperatureair , foamed white vapor . Sylvia slipped the sample into the pot . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete analysis of every life form we 've found on this planet . I 'm going to run a gene analysis . It will take about ninety minutes , and we 'll have our answer . Is that all right with you , Terry ? " " Do n't make me out for a villain , " Terry said flatly . " Something terrible just happened here , and I want the truth . " Sylvia removed the frozen section of flesh , and Jerry started up the automated apparatus . A conveyer belt hummed , trundling into a rectangular box of chrome and white enamel . She placed the smokingsample gingerly on its tray , and it disappeared inside . There was a tiny , high-pitched hum as the laser saw sliced the meat into specimensonly a few cells thick . Cassandra would build a holographic model and then compare it in depth with the others in her memory banks . Then they would know . Sylvia was n't sure that she wanted to . She turned back to the magnascope , to the tissue sample displayedin a quilt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heartbroken . " It could be anything . Pterodon . Samlon . Or something we never even dreamed of . " It may have only been the terrible fa/tigue , but a tear welled at the bottom of her eye , and she wiped it away harshly . " What are we doing here ? " She snatched the sample tray from under the scope and hurled it across the room . It broke with a tinkle of crystal , and a spatter of clear fluid against the yellow plaster . " Just why the hell did we come ? " " We 're all tired , " Zack said . " It 's going to be a couple of hours before we have answers ? " " Close enough , " Jerry agreed . " Then let 's get some rest . Before this is over , we 'll need every bit of it we can get . All right ? " Carlos looked at the wall , at the still form of his friend , strapped now to the table . " What about Cadmann ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I know that I 'm too tired and sore to think . I need some rest . He 'll keep . " " Everyone but Jerry out of here , " Sylvia said . " I want to stay . " Mary Ann stood against the wall , her arms folded , eyes fixed on Cadmann . Zack was still massaging his stomach , feeling for bruised ribs . Every few seconds he wheezed in pain . He said , " Carlos , take care of Mary Ann . We need to clear out so that Syl and Jerry can work . " " No , I 'm not  --  " Sylvia closed her mind to the sound until she heard the door close behind them . Then she and Jerry methodically stripped Cadmann , sprayed his burns and minor wounds and covered them with gel . When they were done with the hemostats and the dissolving thread and the unguents , they slipped him into a clean smock and refastened the straps . Then they turned out the lights and left . She shivered in the fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think happened out there ? You do n't really think Cadmann did that damage to himself ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know anything right now . We 'll know in a little over an hour . Just let me close my eyes for a few minutes . " Jerry nodded and started back to his cottage , to the dubious , transitory comfort of a warm bed , when Sylvia 's voice stopped him . " I can tell you one thing , Jerry . No matter what we find out ,  |p105we  're not going to like it . I promise you that there are n't going to be any comforting answers . " " Yeah . " Jerry hunched his shoulders against the chill . He turned to speak again , but Sylvia had already disappeared around a corner , or into the fog , and he was alone.  |p106A  man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green . FRANCIS BACONIN THE SHADOWS beyond the fence , something watched . Something alive , silent , almost motionless save for the rise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was badly hurt . It had passed the horizon of pain into territory that was strange indeed . Irreversible changes had taken place in its body . In a distant way , it even understood that it was dying . But first there was an obligation . It hid in the shadowed fields beyond the reach of the searchlights . When it concentrated it could smell the man , the one who had hurt it . This one , whom it had badly underestimated , was the real threat . And every instinct screamed for it to get to him , to find and kill him . It began to wiggle forward . It lay between rows of corn , just a few dozen meters southwest of the colony . The searchlights still swept across the ground , and the men still walked the edge of the camp . How to get past the firevines ? It moaned hungrily. 1Uhp107In the next instant the solution presented itself . One of the men ran his forepaw along a section of vine . He touched it  --  leaned on it . It recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had bitten it before . It seemed safe now . Perhaps firevines could only bite once ... . The man was alone and not even looking in its direction . Now . Now , as the searchlights crisscrossed , there was a moment in which darkness was almost total , when shadow licked the fence , the man , and a stretch leading almost to the fields . It moved . It moved as fast as a Skeeter skimming at low altitude , moved so fast that the man at the fence hardly had time to look up , had no time to scream before it hit the fence with such momentum that the aluminumfencepost buckled and the lines snapped , that its impact slammed him back into the wall of the veterinary clinic . His head dimpled the sheet metal and rebounded directly into the creature 's flailing spiked tail . It shook the man 's head free of the spikes , let the corpse slide to the ground . It flowed onward , a quarter ton of rippling muscle and bone , black as a shadow , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bluff , as much a part of the night as the stars or the twin moons . The creature nudged the door open . It sniffed tentatively at first , then entered . There was little light inside , but it needed less than it found . Animals were caged along the walls . Curiosity was almost as intense as the pain and resolve , and it stopped for a moment to peer up into one of the cages . A small white shape curled up in the corner , hidden in a mass of wood shavings . The tiny alien stirred slowly , then jerked to wakefulness , staring , blinking its tiny red eyes . The creature had seen that look before , many times before . Total submission . A trembling readiness , the prey 's acknowledgement that it was ready to be food . No running . No fighting , its heart ready to burst before it was ever touched . Not now . The creature could smell the man , and it turned toward the smell . The man lay on a table . He moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines . That was just as well . It had no urge to play with this one . It braced its paws on the table , stretching , feeling the hurts in itsp108body , the pain along its sides where it was burned and torn . The long wound in its flank opened again , trickling fluid . It braced itself and tried to jump up onto the table . The table was not a boulder . It tilted . The safety blocks on the wheels popped free , and the table skidded across the room , tubes ripping free of the man 's forelimb , dark fluid spraying as they crashed into the wall and the table flipped onto its side . As the table thudded to the floor , the man 's eyes fluttered open . Their eyes met . Here it was . Here was the moment it craved . Here was the moment when the hunger and the pain and the anger vanished , and it saw into those eyes as down a deep , chill waterhole , a bottomless grotto . The man 's eyes grew wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The creature drew closer . This was the deadly one . His skin was so soft , so fragile . It pawed experimentally , raking away flesh . Blood streamed from pinkish pulp beneath . The man grimaced , showed his teeth . Small teeth , flat and harmless . The man was so weak ! and yet he had hurt it as nothing else in its short life . The man was at the moment of death , his limbs bound , drawing back as far as he could , shrinking against the table , but his eyes held nothing of submission . His sluggish muscles struggled in the bonds . So much had changed so quickly in its life . And this one Man had been at the center of so much of it . End it now . But his eyes . They met its own so steadily . Helpless , bound , about to die  --  and yet .. . And yet .. . There was a scream from outside , and a sound of pounding feet . Its attention was split by confusion and uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes , and it knew that somehow he had won , they would win , and that its life was over . Pain bit into the back of its head , and it spun as a second bullet missed it by inches . It charged directly at the man holding a long stick which spat fire . It felt another , awful pain , and then it was on him , his head in its mouth . There was a moment of bony resistance to its jaw muscles , then splintering collapse and softness . It spat him out and rushed for the door . If it could reach the river . . .  |p109But  the doorway was crowded with men and their firesticks . It howled its agony , reversed directions , flailing its tail at them , feeling the pain bite deep until the thing in its body triggered , and the entire world seemed made of blood . It exploded in the other direction . There were more of the vinelikethings , and small metal objects . Strange smells filled the room as liquids spilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the tail struck them . Instantly it wheeled . The head smashed at the thin walls . Something ripped open . An entire corner fell away . Outside was night , and the chance to find the river , to shed the heat that was cooking it from inside . One man blocked its way , and it slammed its tail into him , the spikes piercing his leg . It could n't shake him loose ! He screamed and screamed , confusingand slowing it , even with speed raging in its body and fire raging in its mind . Another flick of the tail smashed him against the corner of a building . It pulled its spikes free , leaving him leaking and moaning on the ground . But the men were everywhere now , and it ran this way and that , plowing into them , its body spasming , out of control now , blind with the blood in its eyes.  |p110I  fled , and cried out , Death ; Hell trembled at the hideous noise , and sighedFrom all her caves , and back resounded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . Someone screaming . A shot ? Sylvia groped her way up from a dream that clung like a moist membrane . The bubble of groggy sleep thinned as she wavered near wakefulness . Tactile : Terry next to her , behind her . She felt the soft swell of his stomach against her backbone as they nestled like spoons . Visual : Darkness . Outside , filtered by the drapes , a dim light glowed . Searchlight 's glow . All was well . Auditory : The heavy , liquid sound of Terry 's snoring . Nothing new or unusual there . Sleep yawned , beckoned . No . Wrong thought , wrong time . Her eyes fought to focus in the dark , to find the clock . How long had she slept ? Was it time to get up again  --  ? Another sharp crack of sound , unmistakably a shot . A searchlightp111briefly lit the drapes . From all around the camp came shouted inquiries , groggy at first , then alarmed . She lurched up in bed , throat scratchy with sleep , groping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Terry . Terry  --  " " Mmmph . Fug . " Terry rolled onto his stomach , surprised when her body was n't there to support him . His arm flopped out . " Huh ? Sylvie ? " She was already pulling on her pants . Terry 's fingers stretched out grazingly , and brushed one of her nipples . A wave of desire warmed her , startled her with its strength . Terry , you pick the damnedest times . She shut that part of her mind down and focused on the window , on the wildly swinging lights that filtered in through the drapes . Terry came fully awake as Sylvia slipped on her shoes . " What fool 's raising the roof now ? " " I do n't know . It 's by the animal pens , and  --  " And the veterinary clinic . " Cadmann , " she whispered . A volley of shots . Terry virtually levitated from the bed . " What in the hell  --  ? " There was screaming now . " Hurry up . " She paused just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed , then ran for the courtyard . The huts were generally divided into two sections , sleeping and living . Although the communal dining halls were used by all , many  --  most of the colonists had their own private cooking facilities and a place to entertain friends . The space that she shared with Terry was small and might have been considered cozy , a place of warmth andShe crossed the courtyard and stopped in horror . Figures backed out of the clinic . They were shrouded in darkness and fog that swirled like milk in thin tea . Four stylized shadows , posed  --  four generic riflemen . They fired into the doorway . Something within was screaming and shaking the building like a rat caught in a milk carton , screaming with such energized venom that for a moment she was frozen in her tracks . She made herself move . A row of garden tools leaned neatly against one of the huts and Sylvia snatched one in a two-handed death grip . She circled the bungalow , seeking a glimpse within . No room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get closer.  |p112She  recognized one of the riflemen . " Carolyn ! What is it ? " There was no answer . Carolyn McAndrews and her companions fired wildly , fired without targets . They 're crazy ! Rifle bullets tore through the metal walls of the veterinary clinic . There were sounds of shattering glass from three buildings away . " For God 's sake , what 's happening ? " Colonists poured into the main boulevard outside the clinic . Robes and pajama bottoms still being pulled on , bare chests and legs or fully armed and dressed perimeter guards , they sprouted out of the darkness . Steps pounded behind her . Terry grabbed her arm . " What  --  ? " The metal wall of the veterinary shack cracked wide . Something screamed . The sound locked every muscle in her body . They 're not crazy at all , she thought , and , It 's come . The crowd scattered as the metal sheeting peeled back farther , distended , and something black smashed through the opening . Terry 's grip was like a vise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Cadmann ! " Sylvia tore free from her husband . He caught her again and pulled her back as the creature bounded into the crowd . Death was alive in the night , no longer something which haunted their dreams , no longer a specter to be buried with Alicia and the bloodied scraps of swaddling . It was alive , and glistening , and it moved among them like a demon of muscle and scale and teeth . It moved too quickly for Sylvia to get a distinct picture . Dark ! Too damned dark ! And the searchlights swiveling to cover it were woefully inadequate , jerking spastically around the yard . For a moment the monster was halted by a ring of colonists with sticks and guns . It stood at bay against the shattered remains of the veterinary-clinic wall . Handlamps , then the searchlight from the watchtower swung toward it . Sylvia saw eyes the size of oranges with huge black pupils . In the same moment those pupils closed to pinpoints . It hissed . Blood sprayed from a dozen wounds that ranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than arterial blood . The massive tail smashed at the sheet metal . The screams smashed at the ears . For just that instant it was contained , and thenThe pupils opened slightly . The creature shook the blood from its eyes and moved . Sylvia gasped . A good racing car might have accelerated that fast . Terry pulled hard on her arm and they were both falling backward as the monster smashed through the line . Two goodp113men flew away like dry leaves in an autumn whirlwind , and one kicked Terry across the forehead as he flew over , all before Sylvia hit the ground . She crawled behind a huge reel of insulated wire . The great tail swung . There were spikes on the end  --  and BarneyCarr flopped helplessly along the ground , spiked through the leg , as the monster whipped this way and that . Barney 's head cracked into the corner of a building ; his face disappeared in a smear of blood . The creature shook him loose and he lay still , only his hands clenching and unclenching spastically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tears streamed from his eyes . " Damn you ! " he screamed . The creature turned . Terry staggered up , muttered , " It 's killing them ! " He looked about wildly , then jerked an iron rod from a stack of fence stakes leaning against a shed . He glanced back at Sylvia , just one frightened flicker of his eyes . " Terry  --  " He turned away , turned to stand between hell and his wife and unborn daughter . " Terry ! " He was already part of the melee . The creature was big , larger than a large crocodile , and built like a tank : compact , invulnerable . It should n't have been fast  --  but , wounded and bleeding , it moved faster than anything ever bred on Earth . It leaped from the circle . Armed colonists ran to surround it . Others fired when they could see nobody behind it . Even as they ran it moved again , and again , so that they could n't surround it . Sylvia had never seen , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the dirt , losing its balance and skidding to a stop ; waiting , then blurring aside from a scattered volley of bullets . Move , stop , warily scan its enemies , see their intentions and move again  --  Thank God that it seemed more interested in escape than destruction , but even as it thrashed blindly it left death behind . Red silk kimono and pale blond hair flagging behind her , Jean Patterson ran for her life . Before she could reach the safety of her hut she met the flailing spikes of the monster 's tail . Her truncated scream was a barking sound in the night , and she skidded and flopped along the ground to crumple close by Sylvia 's concealing coil of wire . " Jean ! " She stared up blindly , her head twisted far around . Too far . Thep114spine was crushed . Dr. Patterson thrashed without feeling . Jon van Don ran to intercept the monster and haplessly blocked its way as it fled toward the road . Instantly the monster was on him . It crushed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pierced and dug , ripped through jacket and pajamas and skin , snapped bone and drove jagged ribs into lungs . The searchlight slid over him to show pink bloody froth at his mouth and nose . His screams never stopped . Sylvia clapped her hands over her ears and squeezed her eyes shut . It was n't enough . She could n't shut out the sounds and flashes of light : the shots , the screams , the slap of feet , and finally , the wave of heat that tore her from her cocoon . She could n't help it , she peered through her fingersGreg . Somehow he had roused himself from drug-induced slumber . He staggered , legs mere rubber , but his face was a mask of rage as he advanced on the creature . On his back , slung skewed with only one of its shoulder straps buckled down , was one of the flame throwers that had been used to burn the bramble bushes from the plain . Its nozzle spewed a twenty-foot stream of liquid hell . Flame licked at the monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was shouting something . She could n't really hear his words over the roar of the flames , the human sounds of anguish and terror , the bellow of the creature . But she knew : Greg was screaming obscenities , the things she would be saying if her own wife and childHusband ? " Terry ? " She could n't see him , but there were bodies everywhere , people crawling and sobbing , and the B-movie monster skitteringaround the quad trying to find a way back to the darkness  --  the river ?  --  its tail to the power shed now . It hissed as Greg advanced . It sat there for a moment , and then with the speed of a flea jumping from a complete standstill , it leaped at Greg . Greg did n't even flinch , too far gone with grief and rage to care . A tongue of flame lanced out and met the thing in midair with a horrific whoosh ! that stole the dark and chill from the night . It hit the thing squarely , in one eye-searing moment converting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't what saved Greg . Sylvia had seen the creature 's bullet-torn hind leg collapse as it leaped . It was sideways to Greg as the flame caught it , and it dropped in front of him , burning , motionless.  |p115It  was dead . It had to be dead  --  nothing could possibly survive the bullets , the fire  --  and Greg sent a steady tongue of flame licking into it . Flame rolled up from its body and exploded against the shack behind it , jellied gasoline spattering everywhere . Then it moved . Without any warning sign at all the damned corpse was moving again . George Merriot leaped away , too slowly ; the creature brushed him and he was aflame . The burning man thrashed on the ground , arms flopping , trying to put out the jellied gasoline sticking to his jacket and pants . Rachel Moscowitz was battering at him with a blanket . Bobby Erin whipped off his robe and slapped it onto George , totally unconcerned by his own resulting nudity . All eyes were on the monster . The monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blink of an eye , and once again was motionless . The smell of fuel and burnt flesh boiled up from it in nauseatinglydense clouds of oily smoke . It moved . Its tail was a sudden blur , and then an impossible living fireball streaked for the river , fifteen good meters this time . Through the smoke and flame she could see its head wagging slowly , agonizingly , as if trying to orient itself . Its tail lashed mindlessly . Greg followed , firing the flame thrower not in bursts but in a single continuous stream . He laughed and cried hysterically , unmindfulof the havoc he was wrecking . " You  --  stay still  --  Aliciayou  --  " Firing the flame thrower at the tail had the same effect as firing it at a spinning propeller : a blur , a thin , curdled mist of flame . Buildings were afire all around them . Stu Ellington , his moon face ruddy with fear and adrenaline exhaustion , cried , " God 's sake , Greg , put it out ! Put the damned thing out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aiming not at the dying thing wrapped in a web of flame , but at Greg . " Greg  --  " Greg did n't , could n't hear the order , but the flamethrowertanks spat out their last breath of fire and were empty . Trembling , Stu lowered the barrel to the ground . " You , die , die , damn you , die  --  " Sylvia was startled to hear her own voice , hear herself chanting , not knowing when she had started it , knowing only an intensely morbid fascination with the thing thatIt moved , and this last leap took it over the edge of the bluff . It did n't even scream as it fell . " Get it ! " Zack bawled instantly . " Do n't let it get away . " Colonistsp116ran toward fires and the injured . Zack grabbed randomly . " Jill . Harry .

Something had bruised her ankle . She pulled the robe about her swollen stomach . I should do something  --  Smoke and blood and the stench of cooking monster flesh filled the air . A dozen bodies lay scattered and bleeding . Jean Patterson brokenand twisted and still at last . Jon van Don , Sylvia 's next-door neighbor , his face a mask of blood , fumbled with numbing fingers to stanch wounds across his midsection . Scenes from newsreels , from long-past wars on Earth . Sylvia wandered blindly through hell . " Terry ! " He must be all right . He must be helping to put out the fires  --  Flames grew everywhere . Tanks spat white foam into the wreckage . A thin current of wailing was an incessant background to her every thought . Broken glass and wood and plastic crunched under her every step , and Sylvia was losing it , tottering on the brink of overload . We had time . We should have been ready . We should have known . Cadmann warnedCadmann . Cadmann 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it . One slipper flew off , and the bare pad of her foot skinned along the ground . There was no one at the door of the infirmary , and at first she thought that it was empty . Then she saw Mary Ann and Carlos hunched over Cadmann . Cadmann was n't moving . Blood oozed from a dozen wounds . She fought to get in next to him . Mary Ann turned and glared at her . " We can take care of this , " she said , and her voice was frigid . " He warned you , damn you . God damn you to hell . He trusted you . And you tried to kill him . Go on . I 'm sure that your husband needs you somewhere . " Carlos 's dark face was sliced along the chin , a wound that oozed blood onto his green sleeveless shirt . She reached out to touch him . He spoke without turning . " No . It 's all right . Why do n't you get a first-aid kit and see who needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was no hostility in his face . " Go on , Senora Faulkner . " Unconscious , Cadmann groaned as Mary Ann 's fingers tenderly probed his wounds.  |p117Sylvia  backed out of the room , grabbing the first-aid kit as she went , mumbling , " I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I tried  --  " But no one was listening to her anymore . THERE WAS so much damage  --  everywhere . Her emotions were in such a snarl that it was impossible to find a loose end , somewhere she could begin to unravel . She counted the blanket-draped figures that she could see . At least four corpses . Three times that many wounded , and some would be dead by morning . She walked stiff-legged and numb , desperate to find a way to make herself useful . Terry . She heard his voice to the left , barking orders . He was working with three other men to quell a blaze roaring in one of the storage sheds . Her mind was n't working . She was n't thinking clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store in that shed ? What ... ? The sudden realization hit her , and she screamed . " Terry ! " He turned . " Sylvia ! Get back ! " The sheer ferocity and alarm in his voice took her by such surprise that she did back up , and then she was off her feet , feeling the wall of air before she saw the light or heard the sound . The shed behind Terry mushroomed into a fireball , and the men with him screamed , twitching like moths caught in a Bunsen burner . The edge of the fireball lifted Terry and flipped him into a stack of tools where he lay , clothes smoldering , as the camp burned .... IMPRESSIONS : Blackened faces , bandages . Wisps of smoke rising from twisted alloy support struts . A sky gray with ash , a dawn welcomed with low , despairing moans . Wars must look like this , Sylvia thought . Cadmann would knowThe communal dining hall was smoke-damaged but otherwise unharmed . Now it held most of the Colony , excluding those too badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room save the few mingled , stifled sobs . She felt what nobody spoke of : the sense of relief from those who had come through the ordeal with hides and families intact . The unwounded . There are n't any unwounded . We 've all been hurt . Sylviap118thought . A fragment of song came to her . Sometimes I feel like a motherless child . A long way from home . " Mary Ann  --  " Mary Ann paused in her endless rounds among the wounded . " Is Cadmann  --  ? " " He 's alive . " " Do n't go ! Terry . Where is Terry ? " Mary Ann 's mouth was a grim line . " He 'll live . I think . " " Live  --  " " Maybe . I have to go . You 're not hurt . You 're all right . So is your baby . " Sylvia let that thought sink in . The baby is all right . . . . Another shadow fell across her . Zack wandered aimlessly through the room with a bullhorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the extent of the damage . His eyes were red and puffy . Carolyn McAndrewsfollowed him , a sallow wraith at Zack 's heels . Zack climbed onto a dining table and raised his bullhorn . " I do n't know what to say . " He paused . There was silence . " We . . . we have more than enough medicine and bandages . " The bullhorn bellowedhis voice : gravelly , ruined by an endless night of screaming . " If there are any bite victims that I am presently unaware of , please ... " He wavered , losing focus , and Rachel steadied him . Sylvia felt herself coughing , watched herself raise an unsteady hand . " Zack  --  what do we do now ? What do we do about the de-fenses ? " " Full alert , of course , we activate the mine field . The electric fences . But  --  Goddamn it , Sylvia , you know that thing was impossible ! Impossible ! We could n't have expected that . It 's a fluke . Nothing that large can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There 's no food chain . You said that yourself ! It swam over from the mainland , it must have , and how could I have know it could do that ? " He wiped his forehead with a grimy hand . His voice cracked . " There just is n't enough food to support it . " " It got here , did n't it ? " Ida van Don screamed . Her face was chalk , except for the smear of blood on the left side of her face . " It got  --  " She could n't get the rest out , and buckled over with sobs . Phyllis draped a blanket over her shoulders . " Not enough food , " Sylvia said . She tried unsuccessfully to hold back her own tears . " Yes , I said that . All right , Zack , it was n't your fault ! Is that what you want on your tombstone ? It was n't your fault ?  |p119Zack  , it could n't be , it should n't be , but it 's here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what in the hell do we do about it ? " " Mary Ann would have a suggestion . " Carlos 's voice was dry and carefully controlled . Zack 's lips drew taut . His hands shook . Rachel took the microphone . Her voice was as raw as her husband 's . " Is that a suggestion or a demand , Carlos ? " " Neither . Not yet , anyway . " " Then we need n't worry about it yet . Sylvia , all serious suggestionsare welcome . We know we need more security . Please , all of you , be assured that until the entire situation has stabilized , no aspect of security will be neglected . But we have to start somewhere  --  right now , we have to make sure that a total inventory of the damage and losses is made , and that all of the wounds are dealt with . Yes  --  Andy ? " The engineer stood . His right arm was strapped to his chest . " This was n't supposed to happen . Nothing like this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't go home ! " Jill Ralston , the slender redhead from agriculture , stood . Both of her hands were wrapped in burn gauze . " Dammit , I saw that freaking animal take over a hundred rounds , and half a tank of jellied fuel . It was in the water , and the water smoked . We got a net around it , and its tail was still twitching ! It had to be dead , just spasms  --  but I 'm telling you that it almost killed the three of us . If there had been five of them , they could have killed everyone in the camp . " " Five  --  hell if it would have needed five ! " Ricky shouted . Rachel tried to speak , but despite the microphone she was drowned out in the babble . " One . One more would finish us ! " " Cadmann was right all the time , damn , why did n't we listen to the colonel ?  --  " " Ten lightyears , ten years away  --  " " Power plant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biology lab 's wrecked  --  " Zack took the microphone and waved his hand . " Enough ! Listen , damn it ! " The babble died away . " Look , we 're not going to get productive work done until we rebuild the camp , and we ca n't do that until our minds are at rest . "  | " Yeah , sure , relax , " La Donna called . " Good old Zack . No  --  o  --  o problems . " " Cut the crap . It does n't help the situation if everyone talks at once . Look , chances are we wo n't find another one of these  --  things . No sense in taking chances , we 'll take precautions , but damn it , science is science . There 's nothing for it to live on here . There wo n't be more of them  --  " " How the hell can you know that ? " " There could n't have been that one  --  " " Stop ! You 're scientists and engineers , and the best people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God damn it , act like it ! " All right . Now , just to be sure , we 'll put a study team on the problem . Immediately . What do we have that will kill these .. . monsters ... and do it efficiently ? We 'll find out ! " " I think we need atomic bombs , " Andy said . Two people laughed . Andy sat down again . Zack spoke through pain , pushing his voice when it should have been allowed to rest . " We were n't prepared . Whether we ever run into another of those or not , we 'll soon know what will kill it . One person by himself should be able to do it . We 'll find out . I swear . This is our island , and I 'm not turning it over to any goddamned monster . Ours , do you understand ? " " Right . " Carolyn McAndrews stood and applauded . After several seconds others joined wearily . Sylvia rose and left the room . She walked out through the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the twisted struts . Three buildings had been totally destroyed . The power plant looked bad . People dug in the ruins , trying to find valuables or irreplaceables . Here was the hospital . Its normal five beds had been expanded to twenty . Most of the wounds would heal , thank God , but a few , just a few .. . Terry for instance . Terry lay torpid in a bath of saline solution . Jerry was checking Terry 's wounds as Sylvia came through the door , and his face was grim . " We may have to amputate the right leg . The bones are shat-tered . " She nodded numbly and sat down in a folding chair next to him . Terry was still unconscious , filled with painkillers . His skinp121was reddish and peeling , as if he had been staked out in the Mojave for days . " He 's lucky to be alive , " Jerry said . " We 're all lucky , " Sylvia said soberly . " Somehow , that does n't make things any easier . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one figure that she wanted desperately to see . Jerry caught the look in her eye . " We moved Cadmann back to his hut . He damned well insisted . He 's taking food there . I do n't know . He 's very weak , but there are others who need help more . He 'll heal  --  " Sylvia half stood , but Jerry 's hand tugged at her . " Name of God , Sylvia . You 're not the only one who 's sorry . We screwed up , and we 're paying for it . But you ca n't do any good . How do you think Terry 's going to feel if he wakes up and you 're not here ? Let it be . " She twisted her arm in his hand , and then finally sat back again . Drained . " There is n't anything to be done . " " Nothing . We 've got the body out of the river , and as soon as the wounded are stabilized , we 'll be able to spare you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lovesick schoolgirl . This is your husband . For God 's sake act like it . " A slap across the face could n't have shocked her more , and she nodded . " I . . . I 'm sorry , Jerry . " " Being sorry does n't count for shit . Broken bones do n't care how you feel . They just need to be set . " What time was it ? How long had Jerry been working while she luxuriated in her grief ? It had been twenty hours since the attack . It had probably been two days since Jerry had slept , and he was still going . Shame swept through the depths of her . But in its wake was resolve , and a kind of nervous energy . She stood . " Jerry , thank you . There 's a time for self-pity , and this is n't it . How long has it been since you slept ? " Jerry smiled raggedly , running his hand through a thatch of hair that looked as limp and tired as the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like something I read about once . " " Get out of here , and do n't come back for at least six hours . Doctor 's orders . " " Are you all right ? " " Now I am . I have to pass the favor on . Scoot. "  |p122Jerry  took a last look around the infirmary and shuffled off , grabbinghis coat on the way out . Sylvia rolled up her sleeves , and touched her stomach gingerly . The baby was fine , she could feel that . If anything had happened ... But now there was work to be done . A war zone . That was what it looked like in here . A goddamned war zone.  |p123He  is gone from the mountain , He is lost to the forest , Like a summer-dried fountain When our need was the sorest . SIR WALTER SCOTT , The Lady of the LakeFOR SYLVIA , the next three days were a stabilizing time , a time of learning who was going to die , and who would live . They lost three more during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed that none but the dead slept during those days . There just was n't enough painkiller or somazine to keep the wounded asleep . If only .. . That game was too easy , and too painful to play . " If onlys " turned wishes into guilty visions , turned thoughts of mine fields and guards and infrared scans into haunted caves , vast cobwebbed torture chambers where her sleep-starved mind whipped and racked her without mercy . She was pregnant , and she could n't deny it or hide it , and so every night when others went hack to the hospital after dinner she was driven into bed , and given orders not to show her face until morning . But the guilt and the pain and the sheer stark need drove her on.  |p124She  saw Zack . He was going harder than she . Perhaps harder than anyone . And if she knew that her dreams were pits of despair and self-recrimination , his were beyond her imagining . Her life during those vital hours was consumed with the wounded  --  the burns , the bites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cuts , nervous exhaustion , fatigue , shell shock and even a bullet wound . But Zack had to pore over Andy 's reports as the engineer corps examined the damage . The biology lab was almost totally destroyed . The power plant looked wounded , but was in fact dead . The plasma toroid was punctured ; the only replacements within ten lightyears were in the motors of the Minerva vehicles . And in three days , after the worst had passed  --  after all the fences were mended , the first tentative inventory taken and all the medical cases stabilized  --  it was Zack who performed the service at the mass burial . No preachers . We did n't want any . No preachers , no rabbi , no priests . We are the scientists , rational , thoughtful  --  was that wise ? " They died that we might live , " Zack began . She thought of the last funeral she 'd attended , the last time when she had felt grief gnawing at her like a living thing  --  the day they buried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest . The day she had turned from the rolling green expanse , the endless rows of white markers at Arlington National Cemetery and flown home without a word to anyone . And upon returning home made her final decision to accept the offered berth aboard Geographic . That day , and its decision , and the accompanying grief were like a wood-grain finish buried under layers of cheap , cloudy shellac . It only came to mind when she thought of how very much her mother would have wanted to touch her stomach , to hold her and cry happily with her as women cry , rejoicing in the torch of life being passed from one generation to the next . No , today was worse . One hundred and seventy-four survivors were here for the ceremony , all those who could be moved from their beds . Sylvia held Terry 's hand as he sat in his wheelchair . The word was n't final on his spinal damage yet , but the irony was crushing . We 've got good news and bad news . The good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg !  |p125The  bad news is that his spinal cord was severed , and he 'll never walk again anyway . There were twelve graves and a thirteenth marker . April , Alicia 's baby , the first child born on this new world , had never been found . Greg stood near them , and there was a quality in his face that she had associated with Ernst since the Hibernation Instability . His face was empty . It fit . Everything fit together , a mosaic that began with the endlessexpanse of dappled gray clouds and the thin stream of smoke rising from the smoldering tip of a volcano just the far side of the horizon . Perhaps most of all , what fit was Cadmann . She saw him out of the corner of her left eye , standing alone , with Mary Ann . Strange how that phrasing came to her . Mary Ann stood near him , almost touching him , but they might have= been strangers in a subway : intimatethrough proximity , yet each sealed in his own world . Cadmann 's head turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she longed to cry out to him , realized through his inaccessibility how very much she cared . But Terry 's hand gripped hers , and Zack 's voice called her from her reverie. " . . . that we might live . All of us knew the risks , but these  --  these few paid the price for our mistake . With time , all of us will lie beneath this soil . Let these . . . thirteen . . . be the last to die by violence . Let our loss merely strengthen our resolve , deepen our com-mitment . " He cleared his throat . Usually he reminded Sylvia of Groucho Marx . There was no hint of comedy now . He looked old and tired and frightened . " Does anyone want to speak ? " There was a moment 's silence , then Greg spoke in a voice that was pure venom . " Why did n't we listen ? Why could n't we have listened ? Did Cadmann ask for so much ? " " Greg . . . " Zack 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Piss on you ! " Spittle flew from the corner of his mouth . " We combed this goddamned island from one end to the other , and we did n't find a fucking thing . Now we ca n't find anything , and people are already starting to say that that must have been the only monster . That it swam over from the mainland . That 's bullshit ... " " Greg  --  "  | " Fuck you , Zack . I trusted you . We all trusted you . You were supposed to be the one with the big view . Alicia trusted you . And now she 's . . . she ... " Tears streamed from his eyes and he collapsed to his knees at Alicia 's grave , his fingers clawing at the earth , all the pent-up emotionexploding out of him at once . It was a trigger . Others were crying now , quietly or with great wracking sobs . From the corner of her eye , Sylvia saw Cadmann turn on his crutches and hobble away . Silent , solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family he would ever have . IN TIME Sylvia lost herself in the work , and in greater time the flow of the work itself began to slow . Nobody was unaffected by the grief , and in a way it turned into a bond stronger than the original heigh-ho Manifest Destiny enthusiasm that had built an interstellar expedition . Repairs were underway around the clock . In the middle of the mistiest night , the sparkle of laser and plasma torches lit the gloom like dazzling fireflies . Within another week , what had happened had become a symbol almost as much as a reality . The electric wire around the periphery of the camp had been reinforced , reestablishment of full power given the highest priority . Guard shifts were doubled . Every night , several times a night , Sylvia awoke from troubled slumber , to be lulled back to sleep by the silent bob and swivel of the searchlights . The mine field had been reactivated , providing the first dark moment of humor since the tragedy . At just after three in the morning , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed colonists had joined guards outside the gates to find a storm of feathers still drifting down : a prodigal turkey had returned . Grim jokes about turkey bombe and flambe had circulated for the next two days , and had helped the healing begin . SYLVIA ceased her efforts to write a new voice-recognition program into Cassandra as a familiar , disturbing figure limped past her window . Cadmann . A crutch under his right arm , side bandaged , a ragged , badly healed scar creasing his cheek in a false smile . A silent giant with dark , accusing eyes . He spoke to no one , taking his meals and medication in his hut  |p127No  one challenged him . No one dared to tell him that he should not hate them for what had been done . In her mind Sylvia could see that thing squatting atop Cadmann , grinning down at him , slowly raking the flesh from his body . For a warrior of Cadmann 's nature to have been disarmed , ( loped , tied and then abandoned to be monster bait was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . And so , to their communalshame , nothing was . Two WEEKS later , the door to her lab opened without warning . Zack Moscowitz came in . " Well , he 's gone . " " Hi , Zack . " " That Skeeter you heard . Cadmann stole it . " " Stole  --  " " Or borrowed . He did n't say . We tried the radio . He is n't answering , and he 's disconnected the tracer . We do n't know where he 's going , or why . " " You know why , " Sylvia said . " He 's telling us all to go to hell . And maybe we deserve it . " " Yeah . " Moscowitz sighed heavily . " Yeah , I know . Some idiot suggested we go after him and get the Skeeter back . I did n't bother to ask for volunteers . " " So he 's gone . " " Him , and he damn near dismantled his hut . He 's also got two dogs , -a rifle , ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle . He 'll have tools , too , " Sylvia said thoughtfully . " And if you add it all up , it wo n't come to more than his share . " " The Skeeter 's a lot more than his share . " " He 'll bring it back . " " Did he tell you that ? " Sylvia laughed . " Do n't I wish . No , but he will . He has n't any use for a Skeeter , Zack . He is n't out to hurt the Colony . He just wants  --  anyway , you watch , he wo n't take more than his share . " " Yeah . I guess I always knew that . Goddamn him ! " Zack exploded . " Hell , Sylvia , it is n't the stuff he took ! It 's him . We need the son of a bitch . " " And if you 'd  --  " " And if I 'd said it loud enough and early enough he 'd still be here . Yeah . Thanks for reminding me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kilometers from the camp . Everyone came outside , but no one wanted to go closer . After a moment Cadmann creakily levered himself out of the cockpit . One of the dogs leaped out of the cabin after him . It bounded around his feet , as if unable to understand why his new master moved so slowly when there was so much to do , so much to see . Together they walked north . The last Sylvia saw of him was a tiny , lonely figure climbing into the pass , disappearing into the distance and the mist.  |p129He  that goeth about to persuade a multitude , that they are not so well governed as they ought to be , shall never want attentive and favorable hearers . RICHARD HOOKER , Ecclesiastical Polity " SAVE IT ! " Sylvia screamed as lights flickered throughout the camp . Jerry 's hands flew over the keyboard . Cassandra 's memory banks had just begun saving when the entire camp plunged into darkness . Shadows flashed back as the sizzling flare of arc welders beyond the communal dining hall created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window to the welders . " Goddamn it , you could warn us ! " There was no answer . He sighed . " What did we lose this time ? " " Maybe nothing . " Sylvia glanced at her watch . " Know in a minute . I 'll be glad when they get the power plant rebuilt . " " Yeah . " He tapped idly at the keyboard . " They say you can get used to hanging if you hang long enough , but I 'll never get used to the power going out . " A brief flare of light , and Jerry 's face was outlinedin the darkness as he lit a cigarette . " Have one ? " " You know better than that . "  |p130He  shrugged . " Good time to start . " He put the stiff foil package away . This was a bad time , miserable in almost every way that Sylvia could think of . If Cassandra had n't been damaged by the monster , her automatic power backups would have allowed them to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been damaged , all data would have been automatically backed up . If the power plant had n't been damaged , there 'd be no need to run cables from one of the two Minerva shuttles . There would have been a smooth , uninterruptedflow of electricity to the camp . They were lucky to have power at all . The solar collectors uphill did n't collect enough power , and the storage capacity was tiny . And they had dynamite . How do you get power out of two hundred kilos of dynamite ? They 'd found an answer : they 'd dynamited a cliff to dam the river . Now the river featured a long , narrow lake downstream from the camp , a landing field for the Minerva , and now the Minerva'smotor could be brought within reach of cables from the half rebuilt power plant . " There she goes , " Jerry said as the lights winked back on . " I do n't know how much more of this I can handle , " Sylvia said , wiping moist fingers on her pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluntly . Cassandra booted back up almost at once , and they breathed a paired sigh of relief : none of the data had been lost . Sylvia spoke softly . " Cassandra . Correlate and evaluate : optical-infrared scan , North Sea . " " Acknowledged . " The computer continued its cross-referencing of the data it received from the geosynchronous satellite above the campsite and the transient data gathered by the lower , faster-moving Geographic . " Northland is heavily populated . " Jerry 's voice held irritation now . The two were like an emotional seesaw . " Conclusive signs of aquatic life . How in the hell are we going to zero in on something like our monster coming over ? " " Data , Jerry . There 's an answer for everything that happened , but right now we just have to correlate data . We ca n't even say exactly what we 're up against . If the protein spectrophotometer can be repaired , we 'll get a look at the thing 's DNA . Until then , we 're doing autopsies on a corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern . This island is underpopulated . Wep131know that . Not enough differentiation . Samlon , plants , and those damn pterodons high up in the mountains , and they all look alike . It 's  --  " " And insects  --  " " Okay , insects . All tiny . All flying things , no crawlers , and all these empty ecological pockets . It 's like ... maybe . . . Sylvia ? It 's like the Earth must have been after the Dinosaur Killer . Nothing big . Most of the species wiped out . Okay . Let 's start looking for iridium i  --  the soil , shall we ? A layer of vaporized asteroid , buried , but not deep . And maybe the satellites can find us a fresh crater . " " Dinosaur Killer  --  Jerry , could that be it ? A big asteroid strike , long winter , planetary die-off  --  when ? A thousand years ago ? Five thousand ? The plants have all come back , but not the animals ? " " Even half a million would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other answers , though . Something regular , something that breaks the reproduction cycle . Something subtle . . . maybe it does n't even show up for two or three generations .... " She felt momentary fear . Then she patted her bulging abdomen and laughed . " Ugly thought , but no . We 've had three generations of chickens , and four generations of mice . Go for the Dinosaur Killer . " Her fingers flew over the keyboard , bringing to the screen the endless biological sets they had worked out : animal to vegetable kilotonnage , animal populations in the various temperature gradients . In the varying altitudes . In the dry climes . The wet . And on . And on , as they had for four days now . She remembered sleeping until she was entirely slept out , one Saturday following three college exams . She remembered this as she had once remembered hot fudge sundaes while dieting . The answers were always the same . No hostile life on the island . There could n't be . Nothing for it to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing something obvious . Something I ought to remember . Is this what the  --  others  --  Mary Ann and Ernst and the others felt like ? Something I ought to know , and I do n't . She laughed suddenly . " What ? " Jerry asked . " Nothing . Jerry , I like your Dinosaur Killer . I think you 've got it . " Jerry carefully blew his smoke in the other direction . " Do you think that an expedition will really go out now ? " " No. lack wo n't approve it . "  | " He 'll be lucky if anyone listens a damn to what he has to say after this mess . " " Greg spoke for everyone ? You included ? " " Not you ? " She paused . " I think Zack made an honest mistake , one that any of us might have made , and most of us did ! Zack 's a scapegoat . The fact that Cadmann was right does n't necessarily mean that he was right for the right reasons . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning  --  " " I would have expected a comment like that out of Terry . " " No  --  this is n't a putdown . As far as Cad is concerned , somebodyhas to play Devil 's Advocate . " The program purred on quietly and efficiently by itself . " Cadmann . What are we going to do about him ? " The room lights dimmed again . " Shit ! Cassandra Save ! " THE POWER did n't come back for fifteen minutes . Enough , Sylvia thought . " I quit , Jerry . You should too . ' Bye . " She did n't wait for his answer . Early dawn , but the camp was a hive of activity . The wreckage had been cleared away . New buildings sprouted , bare skeletons rising into the chill morning air . Three work crews in overlapping ten-hour shifts kept the jobs humming along smoothly . Everyone got just enough time to sleep , but not enough to grouse . One monster did this . How many are there ? Dinosaur Killer . It just could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired to relax . She chose to walk the long way home . A chill breeze came from Spaceport Lake , and she wrapped her coat more tightly as she neared the power plant . The engineers were rebuilding without tearing down the original structure . At this stage it had no shape or symmetry , only a chaos of crumbled walls and hastily erected scaffolding . The power plant was one of the first buildings on Avalon . About half a year ago , she thought idly , and nodded to herself in satisfaction because she 'd thought of it as half a year , not just over one Earth Standard . Avalon was home whether they liked it or not . Better learn to think so . The power plant had flown down on a solidly packed one-shot cargo vehicle . A small solid-fuel rocket had dropped it from orbit to glide down on triangular wings . The engine was Minerva-compatible ;  |p133in  fact the whole package had looked a lot like one of the shuttles , with a Minerva 's wing and belly . Motor , wings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And damned near all we have , too . What 's left ? A Skeeter hovered over the power plant . A thin girder dangled from its underbelly . Omar Isfahan waved a handlamp , guiding the pilot , until the girder clicked down , was fitted and epoxied into place . Omar , tallest man in camp by three inches , looked tired . His fleshy cheeks drooped , his tight khaki shirt was dappled with sweat . Elsewherein the structure men were soldering electric cables . When the Skeeter lifted away again someone yelled " Now ! " and the lights flared back to life all over the camp . The glare stole the faint stars from their twinkling positions in the morning mist , but one of the twin moons still glimmered , a tiny dim crescent above the horizon . She felt suddenly , unaccountably lonely . She wanted to go back to her hut and curl up next to her husband . Knowing that Terry would respond , would hold her with what strength he had . Knowing that if she began to cry he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . if only his new depth of understanding were n't accompanied by a complete failure of his lower body . But she was pregnant , and he was sick , crippled , and her need for lovemaking seemed both selfish and unworthy . It did n't help that she still thought of Cadmann  --  not his face , and nothing so crude as a sexual image , only a memory of the breadth of his shoulders . The curve of his upper arm , where the muscle showed most clearly , the unmistakably male smell of his body and breath .. . She held herself , watching the construction on the power plant , barely noticing when Zack emerged from the shadows . " Sylvia . " He seemed about ten years older , but there was strength in that maturity . In the faces and manners of so many of them , now . " How are you ? " " Tired , but making progress , I think . " He nodded without speaking . He was staring out toward MuckingGreat Mountain , and she did n't need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been taken the day after the disaster , Zack would have been ousted and Cadmann elected to the post in a moment . Take the vote soon enough after the disaster , and Zack himself might have led the electoral parade . Not now . Now he 'd fight . " We 're surviving , " he said . " We 're going to keep surviving . Wep134paid our price for this goddamned planet . It 's all we 're going to pay . " " I hope you 're right , but how can you say that ? Anyway , we all made our decision when we left Earth . We knew the risk  --  " " What happened just should n't have happened . " There was absolutely nothing of the old Zack in his tone . She wanted to back away from him . The flash of the arcs and welding lasers cast hard shadows on his face . His eyes were bright . " We do n't know if there are any more of those things on the island , " she said , as gently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We have time . Those things do n't have any time . " He turned the collar of his coat up . " You 're going to hear talk , Sylvia . Maybe you 've heard it already . " His breath came in short white puffs when he spoke . " They say that I 'm too soft . That this would n't have happenedif. . . someone else was in charge . Had been in charge . I ca n't say about that . Whatever 's fair is fair . I can tell you this , though . It is n't happening again . Whether I 'm in charge or not . " Sylvia remembered the image of shadow whipping through the courtyard to leave unbelievable carnage and stinking blood slicks on the tarmac . The Avalonian equivalent of tiny , flying insects still hoveredin the courtyard , picking sustenance out of the cracks although they hosed it clean again and again . " Keep looking , " he said . " Harry Siep 's calibrating Geographic 's telescope . Coordinating the satellites . All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to train a second team to do the evaluations you and Jerry have been running , so that we 'll have continuouscoverage until Cassandra is up to full strength again . I 'm working out a new security program . Every foot of this island is going to be re-photographed  --  " He looked at her suddenly . " Have you seen the latest pictures ? " " No . You 've found something ! " " Not what you 're thinking , not more of the damn monsters . We found Cadmann . " A great sigh ran through her , as if she had been waiting to hear that for a week , unable to admit how important it was . " Thank God . Where ? " " Halfway up MGM . Mesa . Campfire traces three days running . He wo n't answer any radio signals , but it 's him all right . " She paused , waiting for him to go on . When he did n't , she said it . " Are we going after him ? " " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hep135did n't take anything that was n't his  --  regardless of what a couple of assholes said . " There was real confusion in Zack 's voice . Muddied , mixed emotions . Sure . He knows what he owes Cad . He also knows that right now Cadmann could snatch the Colony from him . " What do you want to do ? " Zack thrust his hands deeply into his pockets . " I do n't feel that an official delegation would be welcome . A few of his friends , on the other hand  --  people who cared about him and just wanted to make sure that he was all right  --  that might be appropriate . Can you think of anyone who might fit that description ? " She nodded silently . " Good . I was hoping . Well . I 've got things to do . Good night , Sylvia . " Zack walked off the way she had come , toward the rebuilt veterinaryclinic . There are n't any heroes here , she reminded herself . Just survivors . The heroes died two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for one man who we 've shamed and betrayed . We owe him something . TERRY was awake when she came to bed . What medical skill could do had been done . There was no need for him to be in the infirmary  --  the hut was like a personal hospital room , and since the accident , he seemed to need her more than ever before . If only .. . " Sylvia , " he said sleepily , throwing a warm arm over her as she slipped between the covers . She helped him roll over : he had n't quite gotten the knack of doing it with just his arms . He was working out in the communal gym to improve the strength of his upper body . Already she could feel the renewed tautness in his shoulders . In short months he might double his strength . From the waist up , he would be more muscular than he had ever been in his life . A fine figure of a man , those rippling corded arms pushing his balloon-tired wheelchair around the camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would taste the tears . He pulled her close to him , and as he did now , kissed her closed eyes , his slender fingers kneading her back . " I low did work go ? "  | " We 've actually classified four different life forms on the main continent . Two are just huge , the size of brontosaurs . The others travel in packs . Fast . In sprints . Our monster might have been a stray from a pack like that . " " What about the expedition ? " " No word . You might still lead it , you know . " Except that we do n't have any sophisticated prosthetics . So you could stay in the Minerva we send over , and watch while other men and women do the exploring . Maybe Cadmann would like to lead it now ? How would you like that , Terry ? Maybe we 'll wait until I 've had the baby , and I have my figure back . Then Cadmann and I can go over there together . What would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just problems . Manpower . We only have one totally free Minerva . If we need both Minervas somewhere else , the camp is without power . There just is n't going to be any exploration if the satellites and the telescope aboard Geographic can do the job , " Sylvia continued . " I suppose that makes sense . " Sylvia tried to identify her husband 's voice in that comment . Like everything else in the camp , he had changed . For a time she just listened to his breathing in the dark . Then she leaned forward to kiss her husband , kiss the father of her unborn child . His mouth tasted of sleep , but not unpleasantly . He pulled away from her embrace a few inches . " Sylvia  --  what news is there of Cadmann ? " " Mucking Great Mountain , halfway up . " She felt him nod in the dark . " Go up there , " he said finally . " Talk to him . He 's got to come back . " He strained with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the darkness she could see that tears glistened on his cheeks . " Terry . . . why ? " He ran his hands down her body to the gentle swell of her stomach . " Because of this . We 're going to have a child soon , and this planet will be hers . " " Hers , " Sylvia whispered . " I ca n't protect her . Cadmann can help make this island safe . I helped drive him away . I think you can bring him back . " She did n't say anything , just kissed him again , remembering a line from somewhere , That which does not kill us makes us stronger.  |p137Who  had said that ? Kipling ? Nietzsche ? She decided Kipling and resolved to look it up in the morning . " One thing , Sylvia . " His voice took on a wholly different quality . " I 've talked to Jerry . There are going to be ... things that I 'll never be able to do again . You . . . you might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She cradled his head , afraid that she already knew what he was about to say . " Shhh . " " No , " he whispered . " Let me finish . I do n't want you creeping out behind my back , feeling guilty . Sooner or later you 're going to do it . The instincts run too damned strong here . We came to make the children that will rule this world . " There was a definite catch in his voice . " All right . Do what you have to . And know that I understand . Just  --  not with Cadmann , please . I know that it 's ridiculous . I just ask you that much . Please . " She held him tightly , as if afraid that with those words he might have said all that he needed to say , done all that he needed to do , and that life might slip away from him there in the darkness . And as they held each other , for the first time since they had landed she realized how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved her . SYLVIA 'S stomach jolted as the Skeeter hit an air pocket . She lurched to the side  --  the seat belt she shared with Mary Ann squashed them together . The Skeeters were built for two , but would seat three if the three were friendly enough . Mary Ann stared straight ahead , as if a studied stare would part the clouds that shrouded the plateau . The tension between them was so thick you could cut shingles out of it , and on a very deep level Sylvia wished that she or Mary Ann had stayed behind . But it was inarguable that Mary Ann and pilot Carlos were two of the closest friends that Cadmann had . Carlos was also a fine pilot , if a little nervous on landings . Lord knows Bobbi Kanagawa had spent enough time coaching him . At least Sylvia assumed that was what they were doing together . . . . Carlos brought the Skeeter around in a circle , following the **28;15330;TOOLONG . A pterodon cruised by , not so scared by the Skeeters as the beasts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sylvia thought . Carlos 's brow wasp138creased with concentration . He grinned crookedly . " Well , senoritas , el muchacho was not looking for a meal , eh ? " The creature fluttered around them again , peering , poking , but staying carefully clear of the rotors . " Eh ! " Carlos yelled , dark face angry . " Apdrtese un poco , queso de bola ! " Sylvia grinned at him . " You must have practiced that . That 's the most Spanish I 've ever heard out of you at one gulp . " " One gasp . Gulps go in . Gasps come out . When a gulp comes out , it 's time for the mop . What I said in my musical native tongue was an important , sensitive , poetic statement . " Mary Ann spoke for the first time since the Skeeter had taken off . " I do n't speak much Spanish , " she said meekly . " But did n't you say something about moving a fat behind ? " " Ah , senorita  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it . " " There it is , " Mary Ann said suddenly . The fog had thinned , and they were coming in on a mesa about half a mile across . There was tough avalonia grass up here , and Sylvia was surprised at the thickness of the underbrush . Thorn plants , of course , but other varieties too . Shrubs and flowering plants abounded . A squarish tent had been erected , and next to it a husky German shepherd leaped and barked . Cadmann emerged from the tent . He was still a tiny , indistinct figure , but even from this distance Sylvia could see that he was walkingunsteadily . Carlos brought the Skeeter down . They were forty meters from Cadmann 's camp , and Sylvia had to admire his choice of locales . The mist was thinner up here , and there was much more vegetation than on the lowlands . Nearby was a tumbling stream of snow melt . It was clear that Cadmann was well provided for . He could build here . Happily . There 's water and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't overlook that . If there 's game anywhere , Cadmann would find it . " Well , " Carlos said , breathing a sigh of relief . " At least he left his rifle in the tent . " " Note the puppy , please . " Mary Ann did n't say anything . Her breathing had turned ragged . " This is Carlos to Civic Center . We 've reached the encampment . Cadmann appears unhurt , and ally further reports will follow shortly . "  |p139Carlos  grinned at them . " Let 's go . " He unbuckled and hopped out . Cadmann watched them for a long moment , then sat down in front of his campfire . He stirred at a pot and ignored them . A week 's worth of beard shaded his face . He moved stiffly  --  the cracked ribs , Sylvia reminded herself . She wondered if he would let her inspect the damage or take a blood test to check infection , or even take his temperature . There was something in his expression  --  something wild and uncomfortably strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos said , his dark hand outstretched . Cadmann looked at the hand and removed a flask from his pocket , taking a deep pull . Carlos 's hand hung there in the air like half of a suspension bridge awaiting completion . Finally he humphed and put his hand back in his pocket . " What the hell do you want ? " Cadmann said at last . The entire campsite was unkempt . The Cadmann she had come to know would never have been so sloppy . " Just wanted to make sure that you were all right , amigo , " Carlos said uncomfortably . " You were hurt pretty bad . " Cadmann glared at them , took another pull and then dropped the flask to the side . The eyes , the unsteadiness . He was drunk , roaring drunk , and had probably been drunk since he came here . " Yeah . Hurt bad . I guess you must care about that . Your conscience acting up ? Hell with it . " Cadmann ... " Mary Ann began , moving forward . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keep away from me , " he growled . " All of you . Not one of you came up and put your ass on the line when it would have made a difference . Stew in it . " " You can say that to me , " Sylvia said . " But not to Mary Ann . She stuck up for you every time . " " Then where was she ? " He screamed it . " Every night , every goddamnednight I 've had nightmares , waking up with that fucking monsterblowing Ernst 's blood in my face . I do n't know why the hell it did n't just bite my head off . I do n't know .... " The shepherd pup sensed fear and anger , and stood next to Cadmannwith bared teeth , growling low in its throat . " She cares , " Cadmannnnittered . I lc took a piece of meat from the pot and threw it top140the dog . " It 's all right , Tweedledee . They 're friends . " His laugh dwindledto a chuckle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously . Turkey ? Samlon ? Where 's the other dog ? He said , " There 's a . . . critter living up in the rocks . Like a marmot . The dogs sniff ' em out just fine . " He paused . " It would be polite to invite you to supper , but I 'm not feeling terribly polite right now . Why do n't you just say your piece and leave ? " " I miss you . . . " Mary Ann began . Cadmann glared balefully at her , opened his mouth and for just a moment Sylvia was sure that he was going to say something to send her fleeing back to camp in tears . Instead , he just closed his mouth and seemed to chew on the thoughts . " Yeah . That 's great . I can do a whole lot with that . " There was a chorus of cheerful barks from the rocks at the northernperiphery of the mesa , and another shepherd came bounding out , radiating good , healthy-puppy energy . It ran up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartily , immediately gave the same treatment to Mary Ann and then to Sylvia . Satisfied , it trotted over to Cadmann , who ignored him , and then over to his littermate . They sniffed at each other 's hindquarters and bit playfully . " Crotch sniffers of the world , unite ! " Cadmann called . " Cadmann , " Sylvia said finally . " I 'm not going to lie to you . We need you . We lost a lot of good people last week . We 're trying to put the Colony back together again . You would n't have any opposition to the kind of programs that you were talking about . " " I do n't care now . " He shrugged . " Maybe in a couple more weeks I 'll give a shit , but probably not . Do n't tell me about your goddamned problems . I like it up here just fine . Dogs have their instincts , you know ? They do n't cripple themselves up with what they want to believe , and I like that just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the mountain and leave me alone ? " " Cadmann ... " " Get the fuck out of here ! " Carlos touched Sylvia 's arm and pulled her back . " Ah , . . . amigo .. . is your radio working ? If there 's any kind of problem , anythingwe can do ... " Cadmann nodded wearily . " Yeah . You 'll be the first to know . Do n't hold your collective breath . "  |p141Sylvia  turned , trying to hold the tears back . " Sylvia ! " Cadmann called . " Yes ? " " You take care of yourself . " Mary Ann was still staring at him , and for a moment something passed between them : regret or lonelinessor resentment . Something , but it was a message shared just by the two of them , and not for anyone else . " Go on , " he repeated . He stooped to pick up the flask . He shook it disgustedly , then tossed it aside again . " Me , I 'm going to stay very very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three of them returned to the Skeeter , but Mary Ann turned and faced them defiantly . " I 'm not going back . He ca n't say it , but he wants me to stay . " " Mary Ann  --  " " Ca n't you see him ? He 's killing himself up here . He really wants you , Sylvia  --  " Carlos wisely made no comment at all . Sylvia opened her mouth in protest , but Mary Ann cut her off . " Do n't say it , Sylvia . Do n't lie . He wants what he ca n't have . " She stood up straight , a short , strong , pretty blond girl on the ripe edge of plumpness . A woman whose hibernation instability was far more subtle than Ernst 's had been . But she was intelligent enough to know what was gone , and perceptive enough to know what was true between Sylvia and Cadmann . " He ca n't say that he wants me to stay , but what is he going to do ? Throw me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows it . Leave me here . I 'll be all right . " " I ca n't do that . " " Because you do n't know what kind of man he is . Not really . I do . I know just what kind of man he is . You do n't know him like I do . " For a long , hard moment they faced each other , then Carlos said . " All right . I expect to hear some kind of message from you or Cadmann about this over the radio in the next twenty-four hours . Otherwise I 'm coming back . " " Fine . " Carlos entered his side of the Skeeter . Sylvia looked at Mary Ann carefully . There was something in her , some strength that had not been there since the Landing . " It 's changed all of us , " Sylvia said quietly . " Maybe you 're right.  |p142Maybe  you 're the only one who knows him now . " She hugged Mary Ann , kissed her on one warm cheek . " For God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He needs someone . " Mary Ann clung for a moment , then stepped back . " I will . I 'll try . Now , go on . " They climbed into the Skeeter . The rotors whipped to life and Carlos levitated them , higher and higher and then to the east , until Mary Ann 's figure was a tiny , vulnerable speck , walking slowly and uncertainly toward Cadmann 's camp.  |p143The  dwarf sees further than the giant when he has the giant 's shoulder to mount on . SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE , The Friend " POWDERED EGGS and powdered milk and freeze-dried bacon did n't seem to be a promising start for breakfast . But in combination with Mary Ann 's skill and the last of the samlon meat , they produced a savory fragrance that drifted up from the pan in thin wisps . Tweedledee and Tweedledum , the twin shepherds , padded quietly around the camp , tongues lolling pinkly , looking hopefully at the fire . They sniffed at the smoke but kept their distance . If they were very polite Cadmann would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt stirred the leaves and dried grass on the mesa . Avalon 's eternal mist was blown away for minutes at a time . From the edge of the mesa she could look down onto the flatland , where the Colony was distantly visible : a flash of solar cell banks , the dim , interlocking rectangles of the tilled and irrigated land . The faroffhum of a Skeeter tickled the air . A protracted groan issued from the tent behind her , and she turned to watch Cadmann elbow himself clumsily out past the flaps.  |p144He  glared at her , rubbing granular sleep from the corners of his eyes , and grunted , " What the hell are you doing here ? " She did n't let him see her flinch . " Cooking breakfast . " She stirred the eggs and crumbled in another pinch of dried bacon crisps . Tweedledum , the male , crept up within a meter of the fire , drooling . Cadmann shooshed him away and crawled up closer , shouldering Mary Ann gently aside . His bloodshot eyes narrowed with interest . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and turned it into a yawn , scratching himself crudely . Mary Ann caught an awesome whiff of morning breath . Both of Cadmann 's big hands went to his head . " God , that hurt . " " You earned it . You finished off the vodka last night . " " No , " he croaked , genuine distress in his voice . His voice sounded as if something small and struggling were trapped in his larynx . Cadmann backed into his tent , and emerged holding his canteen . He waggled it in one hand , grinning through a week 's worth of beard at the answering swish . " Hair of the dog . " He tossed it back , guzzling with short , choppy movements of his Adam 's apple . Why do you do this to yourself ? Does n't matter . You 'll have to stop now . He tossed the canteen to the side to clank noisily against a pile of rocks . The dogs attacked him simultaneously from either side , yippingat him to play with them or feed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadmann wrestled with them for a tolerant moment , then shoved both away and glared at them nastily . " If you do n't shut the hell up , I am going to shoot you both . I am going to line you up and shoot you both with the same goddamn bullet . Do you understand me ? " They arfed and snapped playfully at each other 's tails and ears . Cadmann stretched , naked but for a baggy pair of shorts . His muscular arms were only fractionally better tanned than his chest . He 's lost weight . The wounds , and then the drinkingMary Ann stopped stirring the eggs as the first curl of smoke wafted up from the pan . " What in the hell is that mess ? " " Call it an Avalon omelet . It 's our breakfast , " she said . He thrust a fork into the pan , probing , and snapped at her , " I low much of it is poison ? "  |p145She  took the fork and shoveled a bite into her own mouth , glaringright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm tough . I can handle that . " He tried to sit in a gracefully cross-legged position , but finally just sort of collapsed into a heap . " My head . " " Your breath . Here . Eat . " Cadmann took the fork back and scraped half the contents of the pan onto a plate . The suspicion in his eyes faded after the first bite . " Damn , this is n't half  --  " At the first sign of her smile he shut up and hunched over the pan , sulking as he ate . Mary Ann poured reconstituted nonfat milk and sipped contentedly . It was startlingly clean , and aerated , filled with tiny , needlelike ice crystals from the snow-melt stream that ran near Cadmann 's campsite . Drunk . Hurt . Mad . And he 's still picked a better place than Zack ever did ... . She squinted across the fire at Cadmann . Time ? Yes , while the hangover lasts . " You can forget about me going back to the Colony . I 'm staying . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . If you want to break both of my legs , that might stop me , but I would n't bet on it . " " You are going , " he said . He ate the last forkful of the eggs , squinted at her and belched with satisfaction . " Right after lunch . " " KEEP the head down . " One of Cadmann 's broad hands clamped onto the back of her neck as they crouched behind an outcropping of rock near the eastern edge of the mesa . " Damn hangfires  --  " Brapp ! ! The sound was not as loud as Mary Ann expected , but she heard it as much with her body as her ears . The shaped engineeringcharge rent the mountainside . Rock chips and clots of dirt flew in all directions . A gout of dust and powdered earth mushroomed into the sky . Crouching next to her , Cadmann grinned . " Fun , eh ? " She bobbed her head nervously . " Finest kind . " His hands were gentle as he helped her to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed his handiwork . The third detonation of the day completed a hole in the granite face twenty meters above the mesa . It looked very like the opening excavation of a mine . Shelflike slabs of rock jutted out from the earth , their ends shattered by the concussion . " I 'm not sure I understand why you do n't just build on the flat . "  | " Were n't you in the camp ? " She heard the sarcasm change to something else . He stared at her . " Mary Ann  --  " His voice softened . " Yeah . Well , there are monsters here . " " I know that . " " So we  --  I  --  do n't want to be on the flat . Also , I want the flatlandfor farming  --  if I decide to stay , all of the farmland will be worth its acreage in gold foil . Second , drainage  --  if I build underground on the hillside , rain and snow melt will run right off , if I build my roof right . Third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll have the best damn view that ever was . Right down on their heads . And fourth , I want us to be unreachable . One path , and it twists , and I 'll guard it . I wo n't be on some tabletop watching one of those come at me at ninety miles an hour . " She saw it now , and her ears burned . My God , of course not ! Why did n't I see . .. the way he looked at me ? Oh . " It was a stupid question , was n't it ? " " Uh  --  " " Cadmann , I know . I can accept it . But  --  well , sometimes it hurts . " His hand moved to touch hers , then drew back . She held her breath . He turned away to survey his work , then turned back , a deeply satisfied smile creasing his face . " There are more reasons , but those will do for the moment . " He looked at her sharply . " Nobody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " I 'm staying . " She stood on her tiptoes and locked her arms around his neck . " I love you , Cadmann . I lost too much coming to Avalon . I 'm not losing you , too . " He reached back to unfasten her fingers from the back of his neck , but she clung too tightly , and finally he just met her eyes squarely . " You do things my way , " he said . " If you do n't like it , go home . Down there , things can be whatever way people decide by vote that they should be . This is not a democracy . Up here I 'm the bottom line . " " Male chauvinist , " she said , kissing him lightly . " I 'm a me chauvinist . I 'd probably be the same way if I was a woman . I just want to get this straight before we . . . start anything . " " I love you , " she repeated . The rock dust at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honor and obey . Is n't that what women used to promise ? I will , you know . "  |p147He  gave her a hard , brief hug . " Then let 's get started . " " Aye , aye , sir . What first ? " " Defenses . Notice anything about the  --  our  --  house site ? " " Many things . " " Boulder . That one . " " Big . " " And it will roll , once I dig it out . So I dig . Put chocks under it first . Levers on the chocks . Anyone wants to come up the path without permission  --  " " Any one ? " " Or any thing . If it comes up and we do n't like it , we roll the boulder down . " " I 'm for that . What next ? " " Terrace down the hill . Vegetable garden . Divert some water from the Amazon to keep the vegetables happy , and us too . Then finish the house . I have to finish the excavation by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want . Then I level the floor and set the corner posts . That will take about three weeks . " She smiled uneasily . " Three weeks . Cadmann , how long are you planning to stay up here ? " It was the wrong thing to say , and she knew it instantly . " Until I 'm finished . Until I feel like going the hell back down . And the instant you do n't like it up here , go . " Cadmann tore her hands loose from around his neck and withoutanother word opened the box of tools and building supplies that he had skeetered up from the camp . He was still limping . A TIRELESS machine , made of polished hickory and leather . That 's what Cadmann seemed to her . For all his injuries and his age , he worked on and on when she was exhausted , when the youngest , strongest men in the Colony would have collapsed and begged for rest . He worked eight hours a day , digging , shoring , piling . . . building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patio . No effort was lost . He never hauled any dirt or stone uphill . He built on the hill and he planned carefully , and every wheelbarrow of earth and rock moved downhill to the growing garden structure . In sonic ways the excavation was beginning to look like a smallishswimming pool , with the deep end  --  nine feet deep  --  at the low/est part , and the shallow higher . He cut deep " steps " into the hill above the excavation , so that the entire cavity measured five meters along the bottom edge and twelve meters along each side . When he was through with the morning 's work , Cadrnann stretched and took off with Tweedledee to check the traps . ( Mary Ann had found another difference between the twins . Tweedledee 's right ear was a bit  --  or , more precisely , a bite  --  short , a souvenir of a kennel brawl that had become serious . ) And here she was able to accompany him , learning to set the wire spring traps that Cadmann set for the slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He said it was a literary reference . At first she was able to do little but help him haul dirt , and cook the meals and clean the camp . But it was too easy for her to remember a time when she had been one of the most competent women on the expedition , and there was no way that she could remainsatisfied with this new role . She learned to set snares . Nets in the stream that ran past the site of the house from the heights of Mucking Great Mountain , a tiny ice-melt stream Cadmann had named the Amazon . With a largemouthedbasket in one hand and Tweedledee 's leash in the other , she explored the mountain , learning the paths and the patches of sliding rock . And it was among them that she found Missy . The snares were set near any of the half dozen or so bushes and plants that showed the characteristic gnawed parallel toothmarks . One patch of plants interested her . They were green and broad-leaved , with thick yellow veins branching from a central stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clustered in the center . None of its flowers were chewed or gnawed , but the roots and leaves were the favorite food of some local creature . When she took a closer look at the flowers , she noted a dusting of dried insect segments , and more dead , delicately winged husks on the ground beneath the blossoms . The word " poison " flashed through her mind , and she was pleased with herself for making the connection . Something was rustling behind the bush , and she carefully pulled the branches aside . There , its neck caught in a chewproof nylon spring loop , was eighteen inches of furred frustration . The Joe had huge orange eyes almost too large for its face . The eyes were imploring , terrified , confused . They reminded her of . . . what was it ?  |p149What  ... ? She stomped her foot in frustration and forgot about it . The creature was in one of the snares , bleeding from the throat , twisting and spitting at her . Tweedledee barked , and the little Joe almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the basket and then cut it lose from the snare . It chattered at her . " Well , Missy , " Mary Ann said . " Ca n't blame you for being upset . " Tarsier . That was the word she had searched for . An equatorial primate , the owner of the largest eyes of any mammal . Found in the forests of Malaysia and the Philippines . She laughed in relief . It was still there . Some of the information was still in her mind , she just could n't call it up on command as once she had . Maybe she could restructure the way she thought .. . She shook the cage and held it up close to her face . " Are you a good-luck charm , Missy ? " Missy spat at her and tried to hide in a corner of the basket . She was more slender than a tarsier , almost like a thick , furred lizard . She lay on her back , claws out and scrabbling blindly . On their way back down , Tweedledee suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dropped the basket . Tweedledeeyipped hysterically , struggling to climb up into the rocks . Missy went absolutely apeshit , squealing and clawing in the wire cage . " ' Dee Dee , get back here ! " Mary Ann yelled , suddenly suspicious . Reluctantly , the shepherd came back down , tail folded contritelybetween her legs . Mary Ann wound the leash tightly around a rock , then climbed up and took a closer look , Missy chattering more loudly . Her ears were rewarded before her eyes . She heard a thin , mewlingsound that reminded her of nothing so much as the cry of kittens starving for milk . There were six of them , curled up around each other like a tangle of hairy rope . They were just babies , barely able to wiggle . One lay still ; it seemed dead . The others looked up at her with curiosity untainted by fear . Mary Ann glanced from the wire cage to the babies , and sudden inspiration struck . Missy was climbing up the sides of the basket , and Mary Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaves into the cage until the bottom was completely matted. ' ' hen she carried the basket up the defile to the rocks . Missyp150chattered even more frantically now . Down below her , Tweedledee leaped and danced , yipping enthusiastically . Mary Ann braced herself between the rocks , thankful now for hours of jogging , because her calves were starting to burn from all the climbing . She reached down into the crevice and gently drew up one of the Joe kittens . It struggled and bit her hand  --  a scratch , hardly enough to break the skin . Mary Ann set the fur ball back down and pulled her jacket sleeve down over her hand in a makeshift glove . This time she could n't feel the teeth at all when she transferred the second Joe into the basket . Mary Ann had to knock Missy down from the side of the cage again , and then a third time when she tried to bite through the jacket . When the first baby was deposited in the cage , Missy scampered around and around in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her child , then licked , and finally wound herself around the kitten , enveloping it . One at a time , Mary Ann transplanted the Joes to the cage . Then she trundled it back down to Tweedledee . The mother chattered up at her vilely , then continued to tie her children into a ball for maximum warmth and protection . Mary Ann looked at the last small , sad body down in the crevice , and shook her head . " Time to head back to camp , Dee , " she said , unleashing the dog . She stood with small fists on hips , looking around the area . What did these things eat ? The adults , anyway ? The Joes looked close enough to mammalian ; there would be some sort of milk gland for the young . There were several types of plants : a kind of lichen or moss seemed to be breaking down some of the rocks , and a viny thing that resembled a colony of long-legged spiders . It grew out of the rocks in symbiotic relationship with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , which she had noticed from the helicopter . Which would the Joe family prefer ? She took a chance : the broadleafed plant that had concealed the snare . She tore loose a clusterof red berries and dropped them into the cage . Nothing . Momma Joe ignored them . Still following the hunch , she tore loose a clutch of leaves , sorted through them for the tenderest , and dropped them in . Missy sprang on them . After careful sniffing , she began to chew.  |p151Well  , that answered that . Feeling absurdly proud of herself , Mary Ann carried the cage hack down to the camp . The sun was unusually warm , and the air sweet , and her mind was already buzzing with ideas for cages . There was something . . . something bothering her about the enclaveshe had found . What was it ? It was beautiful . More beautiful , more lush , than anything she had seen down on the flatlands . Down on the flatlands there was little in the way of tender shrubs . Only the gnarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plant life at a higher altitude ? And come to think of it , animal life , too . That implied something , but what ? What ? Her mind was n't quite clear enough , and she cursed softly . Damn it . Why would n't it come into focus ? Suddenly all the pleasure she had felt disappeared in a welter of frustration . Why would n't her mind work for her ? Hibernation Instability . There . Say it . Accept it . Do n't try to pretend that it did n't affect you , as some of the others do . Do n't try to pretend you still have capacities that have fled . That kind of egotisticalnonsense gets you laughed at or killed . Work within your limits , and learn the steps you always pitied ' tweens for having to take . Where a Bright can lead , a ' Tween can follow . There used to be such smugness in that saying . A genius can take huge leaps , wearing intuitive seven-league boots . Then a corps of engineers and technicianscan turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fix something that it took a genius to devise in the first place . I lost my seven-league boots . But the germ plasm is still mine ! We can make good kids ... . All right . There was something wrong here . But if she had the time and the patience , she could reconstruct the thought processes that once came to her so easily . And it was important for her to reconstruct these . Very important . With the basket in hand , she traveled back down the hill . MARY ANN found it amazing . In three weeks , using a constant , unvarying work schedule , Cadmannhad carved the patio and shoring , tamped down the floor of his new house and covered it with layers of polyethylene sheeting . Hep152had set the corner posts using the lightweight foam-steel braces ferried down from the zerograv smelting facility aboard Geographic , and lined the walls with more of the polyethylene . The roof girders and additional support beams were finally in place . Cadmann disassembled their tent and laid it across the top in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new home . The northern wall was earth , but the southern , uphill side was open to the broad , high steps that Cadmann had cut into the mountainside . Their stove warmed the makeshift dwelling beautifully , and there was plenty of headroom and walking space , more than in some of the 1800s pioneer cabins she had visited in Kentucky museums . They sat cross-legged in the shelter . The stove and the body heat of the two dogs were quite enough to keep her warm as she wrote . Two sheets of paper were spread out , and on one she was listing every plant Missy had accepted as food . So far , there were six varieties . The other sheet was blank . I ought to be recording something , but I do n't know what it is . Damn . But  --  I am useful . Cadmann built it , but it 's our house . The earth that surrounded them on three sides was terrific insulation , and there was something womblike about it . So I 'm missing some brain cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's angry chattering in the distance . Four of the youngsters had survived with her and were old enough to run around the cage . If they could be bred .. . " A garden there , " Cadmann said with vast contentment , pointingback at the series of deep , rising steps cut into the mountain behind the house . " Hanging garden . . . climbing . . . I forget what you call it . Walk path cut in the middle . We 'll be able to mount mirrors at the top . We already get full sunlight as it crosses east to west  --  we can do even better . Roof next , and we 'll top it with soil . " He laughed lazily . " We could plant on our roof if we wanted to . " " It would be nice to have a little more natural light . " Mary Ann folded the sheet of paper and tucked it in with her backpack . He sipped at his coffee , then put an arm around her . It still sent a shiver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept together for the first week , and when he had finally taken her into his bedroll and made love to her it had been an angry , demanding , selfish kind of love  --  and she had not demanded in return . She was happy to he able to give . But now , as his house was taking form , as the Jocs and turkeys filled their cages and makeshiftp153pens , as the plot of worked land doubled and trebled , and the mesa became Cadmann 's Bluff , his personality and signature scrawled more boldly upon it hour by hour .. . He was softer with her at the end of the day , and spoke of " us " and " we . " And she was happy , despite her frequently aching muscles . In the weeks since the attack on the camp , Cadmann seemed to have purged his anger . It had taken useful work , done his way , in his time , to his ends . And the fruits of that labor were his . She moved closer to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel tomorrow , " he said . " I need the channel before I can blast . Mary Ann , I think I can run the channel through the house , through the living room . " " For what ? Oh , the Amazon , " she remembered . He wanted to divert water for the vegetable garden . Something ticked at her memory ... " F  --  F  --  Falling Water . " " What ? " " I remembered ! Falling Water , a house by F  --  F  --  Frank Lloyd Wright , and the water ran right through the living room ! " " That 's what I was trying to remember . You 're amazing ! " I 've never felt like this , she thought to herself . And I 've been married , and in love before , and have had . . . enough lovers to know the difference . There was something about the darkness and the warmth . About being next to a man who had built his dwelling by the strength of his back and his wits . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her feel warm and small and protected . Protected . . . A competent , civilized human being did n't need a protector . Mary Ann Eisenhower , Ph.D . in Agricultural Sciences , had been quite capable of taking care of herself , thank you . She remembered the doctor . . . she remembered . Now she was the dependantof a brawny , self-sufficient warrior . And yet there was no cruelty in this man , no demand for her subservience or helplessness : she was sure that he had accepted her because she could do certain things , she could take care of herself . She could go when she wished , and he made that clear . Yet he had accepted with pleasure her suggestions about breeding the Joes . She wanted to do anything for him , be everything to him  --  but if he ever abused her , that urge would vanish . How strange , and how wonderful . Ilow natural to be here , inp154the earth , huddled with the man she loved , who she hoped would one day love her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely , briefly , and kissed his shoulder , her lips parting slightly , tongue flickering out to taste the salt dried on his skin . He pulled her to him , and there , in their home , made love to her on the packed earth of the floor . And they rejoiced together until both were exhausted , until sleep stole the thoughts from her mind as she curled against his side . The two of them , surrounded by their home , their dogs , the whispering wind and the small night sounds . Together . CADMANN had finished digging the French drain  --  the rock-filled slit , a foot wide , five feet long and three deep , at the uphill mouth of their home . It would trap rain or snow melt before it could flood their home , and was just another of the little things , the thousand little things that Cadmann had done to their homeTheir home !  --  to make it safe , and warm , and ideal for her . For them . Their home was roofed now , and planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrots and corn stretched across the mesa wherever there was enough soil to give anything a chance . Much of it would be lost . She expected the strawberries and the hybridmelon-cactus to do the best . Two pens of captured turkeys and their cage of Joes were thriving , and as she fed the Joes their morning leaves , they were actually happy to see her . The kittens had sprouted into twelve-inch furred lovelies , only slightly less beautiful , and better-tempered , than young foxes . The furs would be useful , and the flesh .. . A sudden cramping wave of nausea fanned through her , and she doubled , gasping , choking back the sour fluid in her throat . This was the third morning that .. . Morning ... ? She grinned , looking up at Cadmann toiling at the drainage slit . Mary Ann threw the rest of the leaves into the cage and dusted off her hands . " Well , Missy , I think that I have some news for Madman Weyland . " The Joe looked up at Mary Ann and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  |p155CALL  her Mama . The taste of the river changed with the seasons . For a time the water would run sluggish and cold . Then the taste of life was scarce ; the flying things were scarce ; the swimming things were dead . Later the water would race , carrying the taste of past times . Mama had seen scores of cycles of seasons . She was wise enough to ignore the ancient tastes : bodies or blood or feces of life her kind had long since exterminated , long buried in mountain ice , released as the ice melted . In the hot season the water would be bland again , carrying only spoor of flyers and swimmers and another of her own race . Mama 's taste was discriminating . One of her kind lived upstream . Another lived even farther upstream , and that one was a weakling . It lived where game was so scarce that Mama could taste starvation in its spoor . Not worth killing , that one , or her nearer rival would have taken her domain . In winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't identify . Not life ; not interesting . The world began to warm again . . . and something new was on the island . Something she had never tasted , something weirdly different , was leaving spoor in the water . It was as yet too faint to identify . Mama began to think about moving . If she followed that spoor she would have to fight , and that was no step to be taken lightly . By summer she could taste several varieties of prey ! The things were n't merely leaving feces in the water ; she tasted strange blood too . I1er rival was eating well . Was it time ? Her rival was youthful ( Mama could taste that ) but large . The faintness of her scent placed her many days ' journey upstream . She would be rested and fed when Mama arrived . . . and Mama settled back into her pool . She had not lived two scores of cycles by being reckless . If her rival sickened , she would taste it . Days flickered past . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing time , for the taste of swimmer meat was always the same . Nothing attacked . Her curiosity lay dormant ... but it was active now , for living things were leaving spoor even in dead of winter , and blood ran down the river now and again.  |p156Oh  , the variety ! Here was blood from something vaguely like a flyer . This one must have been big , a plant-eater ; she had to dig far into her memory to find anything similar . That horrible chemical stench was entirely mysterious : hot metal and belly acid and thoroughlyrotted grass . This unfamiliar scent , judging by its components , would be the urine of a meat-eater not of her own kind . Hunger and curiosity warred with discretion , for Mama had never tasted anything like that , nor seen one either . Once there was a living thing in the water . She snapped it up and chewed contemplatively , trying to learn of it . A swimming thing , primitive , built a little like a swimmer .. . The world was warming when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species . Bottom feeders tasting of mud , they must be breeding despite the presence of her rival upstream . And that , one bright hungry morning , was the burnt blood of her own kind ! Taste of fear and speed and killing rage , taste of chemicals , taste of burning . If lightning or a forest fire had killed her rival , then an empty territory lay waiting for her upstream . If another rival , then Mama would face a formidable foe . The swimmers were startled when Mama came forth in an eatingfrenzy . Swimmers were nothing ; the taste did not engage her curiosityat all . But Mama 's rival would be fat now , and hyperkinetic from impact of sensory stimuli , and Mama dared not come upon her as a desperate starveling . She had not fought a serious rival in many years.  |p157Alas  how easily things go wrong ! A sigh too much , or a kiss too long , And there follows a mist and a weeping rain , And life is never the same again . GEORGE MACDONALD , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tweedledee bounded around Cadmann 's feet . She was leaner , stronger now than she had been only eight weeks before . She was acclimated to the heights and rigors of Mucking Great Mountain , but still seemed happy to be coming back to the Colony . Even here , only a few meters past the firebreak , the distant grind of machinery assaulted Cadmann 's ears . That sound , a constant background hum down on the flatlands , never reached his home in the mountains . A thin line of dust marked the bass rumble of a tractor tilling the fields . Mary Ann walked next to him , her blond hair barely rising to his shoulder . Her presence was a comfort in ways that would have been difficult to imagine just a few short weeks before . How long ago had he walked this path with Ernst and Sylvia ? Back before any of the grief . Back when he could reasonably expect ap158quiet slide into old age amidst herds of children . And he 'd wished for kodiak bears . The view had changed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreckage left by the monster 's assault was not visible from here . With twelve adult casualties out of a hundred and ninety-two , the Colony felt pressure to work . There was healing to be done . Now Cadmann had his home , and something new . . . something very new with the only person in the camp who had believed iii him . He put his arm around her waist and pulled Mary Ann in closer to him . She had lost some weight , much like Tweedledee , but her curves were still rounded , and now .. . Now .. . His arm wound all the way around her shoulder , down to her belly , which was firmer than it had been  --  the work and the life up on MGM was not conducive to softening . Soon her figure would be filling out . And out ! And then . . . He looked at her almost surreptitiously . The nine-mile walk had n't tired her . All downhill , half a mile altitude change  --  the walk had strained his own healing wounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it . He smiled , utterly content . The machine stutter was more distinct now , and when Cadmann looked up , the tractor was rumbling up the glazed earth road toward them , and someone atop it waving his hands semaphore style . Cadmann cupped his hands to his mouth . " Yo ! " Tweedledee galloped off down the road , kicking her hindquarters up into the air with every lope . In his backpack he carried skins and dried meat and samples of all of the plants near their camp , carefully bundled and labeled . CadmannWeyland , first of the mountain men ! Much better than Great White Abo . The tractor was close enough to make out the driver . It was Stu Ellington taking his rotation in the fields . " Hey , hey ! If you 'd waited another two days , I would have won the pool . " Cadmann laughed , yelling back , " If you 'll split it with me I 'll vanish for another forty-eight hours . Who wins ? " Stu stopped the tractor in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled from the engine in waves . " One of the twins . Phyllis , I think . Not sure . Hell with it . It 's great to see you , Cad . Mary Ann . Back to stay ? "  | " ' Fraid not . Opening negotiations . Somebody had to break away from the Colony first . " Stu looked down at them from his seat , his grin cutting through the dust and sweat , and shook his head . " Just glad you 're both back , man . " His expression grew somber . " I 'm so sorry for what happened . " " Yeah . " Cadmann looked decidedly uncomfortable ; then Mary Ann hugged him and patted her stomach . " Stu ! Think I 've got a piglet in the pen ! " " Oh ! Whoa ! Well , this is an occasion . M'lady ! " Stu swung down from the tractor and offered a hand to Mary Ann . She looked back at Cadmann , who just picked her up by the armpits and hoisted her aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these things , I believe ? " " Betcha , " she said happily , and swung up into the seat . She gunned the engine . The tractor made a great , lazy circle . The two men followed it at a short distance . For a while there was companionable silence , and then Stu broke it . " We 've done a lot of rebuilding since you 've been gone . Not just buildings , Cad . We 've got the defenses up , and stronger . Stupidity . Just stupidity . " He seemed to need to hear something in return . " We got blind-sided once , but it 's not going to happen again , I can guarantee it . " " Good to know that . " Stu was almost as tall as Cadmann , but somehow at the moment he seemed much smaller . " Do they know that you 're coming back ? Did you radio ? " " No , I sent a homing pigeon . " Stu looked stricken , and Cadmann felt a little disgusted with himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really felt was right , then fine . I have no interest in seeing or hearing anyone crawl . What 's got inc twitchy  --  skip it . " They have defenses . Great , but where do I come in ? Can they make me inspect them ? Damn . There was a general shout of greeting ahead of them as Mary Ann and the tractor passed the first of the outer pens . Within momentsCadmann was the center of attention . I 've only been gone for five weeks ... . But any momentary discomfort was quickly drowned in a sea of reaching hands . " Cad ! Welcome back ! " "  --  to see you  --  "  | "  --  things have n't been the  --  " And other fragments piled one atop another , overlapping , irritatingand at the same time deeply soothing . Mary Ann stopped the tractor by the machine shops and dismountedwith Cadmann 's assistance . She melted into his hands with a calculatedly sensuous grace that put him on guard . What was she projecting ? She was using that " forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting themselves before a rival . Sylvia . She wore her lab smock , which was freshly pressed and looked like nothing so much as a maternity gown . And a maternity gown that she would n't be wearing much longer . She waddled a bit when she walked , and was carrying the baby low in her belly . She smiled at him , at them both , and there was something very like a wall of glass between her emotions and the smile . Her pageboy haircut was a little longer than the last time he had seen her , and needed a trim around the edges . She held out her hands to him , then , not quite smoothly , shifted positions to offer them to Mary Ann first . " Mary Ann . You look wonderful . " " So do you . I 'm hoping to get some of that glow pretty soon now . " You mean . . . ? " Yep . Sylvia hugged Mary Ann hard , then held her hands out to Cadmann . He took them , fighting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some sense of proportion was called for here , but the instant he touched her skin , something inside him melted . He ached for her . " Cadmann . " Her mouth tweaked in an attempt at a casual smile . " Is Mary Ann right ? You have n't been shooting blanks ? " " Nope , someone slipped a live round in there . At least , that 's what we 're hoping . At least , that 's what we came down to find out . " He hesitated . " Would you take care of my lady for me ? " " You know it . " There were tiny moist jewels forming at the corners of her eyes , and she squeezed his hand . " Hey , big man  --  arc we going to be seeing more of you ? I 'm going to be losing a passenger in a month . " It had to be his imagination , but her hands suddenly flushedp161with warmth . He released them , embarrassed by the strength of his reaction . " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll head back clown . Promise . Aside from that . . . I 've got livestock now , and crops . I just do n't know . " She nodded , unwilling to pressure him . " Listen . . . I 'll take Mary Ann for a full checkup . Stay for dinner ? " " Count on it . " Mary Ann hugged Cadmann and planted a long , proprietary kiss on his mouth , pressing herself against him , to the appreciative guffawsof the crowd . Then she and Sylvia linked arms and marched off together . Cadmann shifted his pack around until the pain in his ribs eased ( and a fresh ache started in the bone of his right hip ) . He continued on into the camp . A zigzag walkway through the mine field was painted bright green , and he followed it , noting the guns placed to cover that path . He nodded approval . None of the children were walking yet . We 'll have to fence off the mine field when they get older . And  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small pink face passed him carried in a papoosekabackpack . What the hell . He did n't have to live here to love those little faces . It was n't the children 's fault that their parents were idiots . Dammit , these were his children too . The veterinary lab had been repaired . Its side was a mass of patches welded in great discolored blotches at the corners . The structuraldamage to the quad had been repaired . Nothing could hide the scorch marks , but there were strings of colored ribbon wired up around the edges , and the beginning of a banner painted in bright orange and green . In the center of the quad was something new that glistened in the morning light . Cadmann bent to read it . Set into the concrete was a metal tablet , tinted to look like brass , that said simply : " Day 295 , Year One . REMEMBER . " Following those words in a silent tribute were etched thirteen names . He traced them with his fingers . Alicia : gone . Barney , Jon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what else to do , " Zack said behind him , and Cad turned to greet him , clasped his hands strongly . Zack did n't look tired  --  he looked hard and wiry and serious . Hep162had trimmed his mustache short , and there was a partially healed burn scar along the inside of his forearm . " We were wrong  --  you were right . I 'm sorrier than I can say . " " Do n't bother being sorry . Just do n't let it happen again . " Zack took Cadmann by the arm . " Come on . Let me show you Monster Watch . " " The mine field  --  " " We turn it on at night . " " And new fences along the gorge . I like it . " " You 'll like it better . " Zack held the door of the corn shack open as Cadmann shucked his backpack . Pain eased in ribs and hip . Two extra screens had been mounted in the room , and there was a cot in the corner that looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat in a swivel chair , his dark face speckled with crawlingdots of reflected light . He distractedly waved a hand in greeting . One of the six flat video screens was dark , but three others viewed the Colony from varying local angles , and two scanned their island from the geosynchronous satellites . " We 've got the ocean-observation program going  --  this is the long view . We 're also analyzing weather patterns to attempt to build up a model . But we 've got optical and infrared sensors working . We should be able to track anything man-size moving close to the surface . If the computer scans an object moving in our direction , it 'll call our attention to it . " The picture abruptly changed to a high-altitude view of the ocean itself . Endless gentle white waves rolled in from the west . The ocean seemed deeply and peacefully azure . The illusion was one of guileless transparency . Of an ocean without secrets , welcoming their inspection , soothing away their fears . " The ocean lies , " Cadmann muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything has surfaced yet . " " Nothing notable . Not so far . " The screen flickered again , and a roughly fish-shaped outline flashed darkly across the display . A wave of liquid crystals , and the silhouette became an animation . A statisticaltable ran its estimate column along the edge . Andy watched the figures hawkishly , then relaxed . " Twenty meters along the side , surfacing fifty kilometers east of Landingp163Beach . Totally aquatic , Zack  --  I 've seen these before . They do n't pose a threat to anything on the land . " Zack traced a finger across the image . " Keep me posted . We ca n't have damage to one of the Minervas . " To Cadmann : " We can get a lot more precise than that . " " I was just about to ask  --  but you 've made a good start . " " We need more , a lot more . All the intelligence that we can gather . " He paused a careful moment , then asked , " What can you report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoping to talk to you about . Mary Ann and I have kept journals . I have skins from six different small animals , and botanical samples . I want to trade my knowledge of the island for other services . I 'll map the interior , let you know anything that I find . In exchange , I want medicine and more vitamins . Mary Ann said Avalonian soil does n't have the right mineral balance . " The computer zoned up on another large , shadowy form . This one was smaller than the first , but was tracked moving in toward the island . It broke the surface of the water for a moment , cresting , then dived deeply . The video image was lost . " We need you , Cad . We have to assume that the thing we killed was one of a set . If there 's more than one , then there 's lots . We 're not slowing down expansion . We ca n't . I swear that this colony is going to be a city one day . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified to check our defense plans and suggest alternatives . If you do n't want to stay here , I wo n't try to change your mind . We need a test outbacker . Someone to give us an idea of how an individual family would fare in the south country beyond Mucking Great . Someone is going to do it eventually , and no one is better suited than you . What do you say  --  be our guinea pig ? " " I already am that . But outback guinea pig sounds better than hermit . " " Same situation , different definition . " Cadmann 's face split in a grin . " Bureaucrats . Damned if you ca n't take misanthropy and turn it into a virtue . " " Damned straight . " A huge weight seemed to have been lifted from Zack . The creases in his forehead vanished , and he sighed deeply . " Oh . Cad , will you take back some tools to take rock cores ? We 're hoping we 'll find an iridium layer . " " Iridium ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the makeup of an asteroid . Evidence of a Dinosaur Killer . Something that simplified the ecology . " " Huh . Maybe . What about the monster itself ? That thing sure did n't act like a carrion eater , and what else would have survived an asteroid strike ? Have you finished the analysis of the corpse ? " " Oh , sure , corpse . Well , we lost a lot of equipment in the fire . Some we repaired , some we worked around , but . . . anyway , Greg cremated too much of the monster . You can hardly blame him , but we 've been analyzing charcoal ! What we get is a picture of something that has a cell structure similar to the samlon or pterodons . Closer to the samlon ; pterodons have a lot more quick-twitch muscle fiber . We 'll be interested in looking at your samples . Half a dozen ? Damn . You 've found more in seven weeks than we did in the year we 've been down . You probably want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen for a while longer , and then nodded . He turned and left the room . Zack followed him out . The sun was high , and Cadmann shielded his eyes with one hand . Workers bustled around the quad . They were setting tables and stringing an orange-and-green banner along the west edge of the courtyard " Celebration ? " " Sure  --  anniversary of Waking Day . Do n't you remember ? " " I guess that I reckon time in terms of Landing Day . " " Most of them were n't even awake when we were down here . They outnumber us , Cadmann . " " I guess they do at that . " He stretched and picked up his backpackfrom the corn-shack stoop . " Where 's Sylvia ? I guess we should talk . " THE CREATURE hovered in the air above the holo stage , only a fourth its actual size , but still too vivid for Cadmann 's taste . He could almost smell its wet lizard stench , feel its heat , see Ernst 's blood drizzling out of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the major speculationis that it swam over from the mainland or that it was carried by driftwood . " Cadmann repressed a shudder and forced his mind back into the discussion . " Fifty miles ! That 's a long swim . Why are you so sure it 's not native to the island ? "  | " Not enough food . Not enough variety of food for a sound ecologicalbase . Not enough of them , either . A stable population needs numbers . Any pair of anything produces one pair that survives to breed , on average . " Sylvia shut down the projector , but the thing still hovered before his mind 's eye . Marnie was examining a Joe carcass . It lay in the middle of a dissection tray , its fur lusterless and limp . She flipped it over on its back , and pressured the paws , hawing as the dark little claws slid out . " You say that you 're domesticating these ? " Marnie 's lisp was still a bit jarring to Cadmann , but she was so totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raising them , at least . It 's Mary Ann 's project . You 'd need a lot of furs to make a bed cover . They 're not all that sweet-tempered . Something like a mink . Anyway , it 's something else that 's bothering Mary Ann . " " She told me . " With the gleaming tip of a scalpel , Marnie drew a line down the middle of the dead Joe 's pink , furred belly , then gingerly peeled away a layer of skin to inspect a fatty layer beneath . Sylvia sat on a stool with her knees pulled up flush with her swollen stomach . She looked like a pregnant elf perched on a mushroom . " In general , " Marnie continued , pinning the flap of skin back , " we do n't know a hell of a lot more now than we . . . should have known before . Built for speed . Incredibly strong . The thickness of the bones gives it enormous leverage . The skin is like armor plating . My point is that as underprepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some silent message passed between Marnie and Sylvia , and Marnie slid the dissection tray into a refrigerator . " I told Jerry I 'd meet him at the breeding pond , " she said , smilingshyly . " I 'll see you both later . " She slipped quietly from the room , leaving Cadmann and Sylvia alone . They stared carefully at the empty stage , and silence hung in the room . " Cad . . . " she began . He leaned back against the wall , crossing his arms , eyes thoughtfully half-lidded . " You know , it gets so damned quiet up there in the mountain . Sometimes , when the air is really still , and the dogs are asleep by what 's k ft of the fire , I look clown from the mountain , and I can just hear sounds from the Colony . Machinery . Maybe sing/ing . Maybe the mill . Maybe animal sounds . It sounds warm , and so damned far away . " He looked at her . She was close enough to touch , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting farther all the time . " " I miss you , Cadmann . I did n't know how much I would . " " Yeah . How is Mary Ann ? " " Knocked righteously up . You did a good job there . Three weekspregnant , and she 's healthy as a horse , and I 'll bet it 's a boy . " " What do you mean , you bet ' ? Is n't there a test or something ? " " Spoilsport . Half the fun is the speculation . She almost glows . She 's so in love with you , Cadmann . So ... " Cadmann watched the slow rise and fall of Sylvia 's belly . " Do you suppose that she 'll be as beautiful as you are ? " " All pregnant women are beautiful . And think that they 're ugly . Did n't you know that ? " Cadmann turned , staring out into the wall as though there were answers scrawled on the far side . " I 'm changing , Sylvia . I can feel it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and we know nothing about this place . When Mary Ann said that she was pregnant , I was happy ... but it was different . I have a daughter  --  you did n't know that , did you ? " Sylvia looked at him , startled . " No  --  it is n't on any of the records . " He grinned . " You 've been spying on me . " She reached out and took his hand . Her thumb rubbed the soft webbing between his knuckles . " I missed you too , big man . " " I was only about eighteen . Elva was twenty-four , and wanted the kid . Wanted to have it by herself . Picked me . Said that she thought I would probably make pretty good basic daddy material . " " I 'd say she was right . " " I only know she had it , Sylvia . And on the little girl 's third birthday , Elva sent me a holo . That was it  --  she did n't want to be bothered with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I suppose so . And resented the hell out of her . " " There you go . " " But still , to know . To know that you have a child somewhere . Learning to walk and talk and swim and read , and everything else , and you 're not there . It 's a little crazy-making . Anyway , that 's just background . "  | " What 's the payoff ? " Her hand closed gently on his . So warm . " That I was shocked at how hard it hit me . The thought that Mary Ann is the mother of my child . It does n't matter how much or how little I love her . What matters is that she 's going to be the mother of my child . " " I see . " Sylvia released his hand and stood up . " Well , that 's what she 's going to be , all right , and if preliminary workup indicates anything , she 's going to be a damned healthy one . Take care of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know . " Sylvia moved a step back , just out of touching range . " I love you , " he said quietly . " I wish that it meant something . " " Shh , " she whispered . " We do n't just belong to ourselves , Cadmann . This is n't an ordinary situation , and we 're not ordinary people . It 's wonderful , and it 's terrible , and it makes me feel old sometimes . But it 's what I chose when I came here , and I ca n't back out now . " " And if it was different ? " " Then . . . it would be different . Lay off . " " All right . " The moment was past , and he let the atmosphere lighten again . " Waking Day is day after tomorrow . Wo n't you stay ? " " So that 's why Zack loaned me a Skeeter . It 's a conspiracy . We 'll be back . Right now , I think that I need to be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She held out her hands to him , and he took them . She was so close , and so achingly far away . " Goodbye , Sylvia . " " Goodbye , Cad . " He bent and touched her lips with his , barely repressing an urge to taste more deeply , knowing that here , in the shadowed clinic , she would have resisted for only a moment , and then held him , even with the swell of another man 's child between their bodies . We 're not ordinary people ... . Cadmann turned and left . MARY ANN was outside , waiting for him , and he was suddenly very happy that he had n't given in to that impulse . He was able to meet her eyes squarely and to hold her . Please . Let me learn to love her . God knows I need to . But for now , the light in her eyes was enough love for the both of them , and together they headed for the Skeeter pad.  |p168MAMA  had never toured the island . The others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mama 's mind was not made up of distances , but of the changing taste of the river . The pond reeked of samlon blood when Mama departed . She staggered with the fullness of her belly . Three days later she was hungry but hopeful . Four mud-sucking alien fish had fallen foul of her . There would be more . The water ran clean again . Mama understood that lesson . She had tasted the burnt meat of her daughter in the water ; but the decayingcorpse was gone almost immediately . Whatever killed her daughterhad eaten the corpse . Once she was able to streak off the edge of a low bluff and catch a flyer rising from below . She caught another hovering just above the water . The flyers were n't timid enough here between territories . She fed when she could . If her enemy were to find her half starved , her body might betray her , holding her slow while her enemy boiled with speed . If she did not find enough food she would turn back . She moved cautiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , moving among rocks or trees or other cover where she could find it , returning to the river only when she must . None of this was carefully thought out . Mama was not sapient . Emotions ran through her blood like vectors , and she followed the vector sum . Anger against the creature who killed her daughter . Hunger : the richly , interestingly populated territory upstream . Curiosity : the urge to learn and explore . Lust : the urge to mate with a gene pattern other than her own . And fear , always fear . She moved slowly enough to learn the terrain as she traveled . Rocks , plains , grassland ; a waterfall to be circled . She found fish of interesting flavor before she would have had to turn back . Farther upstream , things began to turn weird . There were intermittentdroning sounds . Chemical tastes in the water and smells on the wind : tar and hot metal and burning , unfamiliar plants , pulverizedwood . Her progress slowed even farther . She kept to rocky terrain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . Sounds of an alien environment might cover her enemy 's approach . Her enemy must come . She would find Mama ; she could be watching her now ; she would come like a meteor across terrain she knew like the inside of her mouth . Mania 's life would depend on also knowing the terrain.  |p169There  was a cliff of hard rock , and softer rock below , and caverns the river had chewed below the waterline . One of the caverns became her base . Life was plentiful , foraging was easy ; she might wait here for the enemy , for a time . She found things pecking on dry ground . They tried to run ( badly ) , they tried to fly ( badly ) . She ate them all . There were bones all through the meat , and half of it was indigestible feathery stuff . On another day she saw something far bigger flying too far away to smell . It veered away before she could study it . If she could catch something like that , the meat would surely sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invader . The next day something came at her across the water.  |p170The  hour when you go to learn that all is vain And this Hope sows when Love shall never reap . DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI , " The House of Life " BY TEN in the morning , the small white disk of Tau Ceti had burned the eternal mist into fluffy white clouds that drifted across the startlinglyblue sky like flocks of sheep . It was appropriate , almost as though their sun were cooperating with the festivities , had offered them the first vivid day of the year . In the ribboned and bannered quad beneath that hard , clear sky , a dozen food and drink booths had been erected , and from them curled the sweet aromas of half a dozen international cuisines . The stands were all but deserted now , most of the colonists drawn by the sound and movement within the dining hall . Spring had come to Avalon . " Allemande left to your corner gal  --  " Zack wore a blindingly bright pair of red suspenders over handstitchedoveralls . A fiddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did n't actually coax music from it . lack was playing the hayseed image to the hilt as he stomped and sang on thep171low stage , guiding the flux and flow of the square dancers with a theatrically midwestern twang in his voice . His voice was flat but lively : the colonists followed his lead in an explosion of joyous energy . The music itself was an odd mixture of synthesizer keyboard , traditional woodwind and string . Some of the instruments had been shipped aboard Geographic , justified as vital cultural treasures . Some had been cobbled together after landing . And now all promenade , A-with that sweet corner maid , Singing " Oh Johnny , Oh Johnny Oh .. . Cadmann leaned against the wall , halfway through his third mug of beer . The last cold knot of tension in his stomach was coming unsnarled ; his head began to buzz politely . He hated lines . He had waited until the music blared from the hall and the dancers returned to their marks before tapping the cold kegs of beer . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bangled green skirt , throwing her head back to laugh deeply . The smooth white expanse of her throat flashed above a red kerchief . She caught Cadmann 's eye and crooked a challenging finger , blowing him a kiss , silently mouthing Come on before Elliot Falkland caught her hands and swung her around to the opposite corner of her square . Cadmann stretched . Tight spots , wounds not quite healed ? Yeah , he could find the pain in chest and left arm and hip and knee , if he needed an excuse not to dance . It was more fun to watch . Carlos bowed out of the dance , pecking Ida van Don on the cheek as he released her hands . She looked around uncertainly , with almost a touch of panic , then spotted Omar 's huge frame and pulled him from his seat , tugging him into the patterned chaos , whooping with glee . The glee was not entirely spontaneous . Her smile seemed too rigid . Cadmann wondered if her dreams still rang with Jon 's dying screams . Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles staining the armpits of his red flannel shirt . " Ah , amigo . I am getting old . The senoritas are too much for me . " " Then do n't get married . " " Vertical and horizontal dancing are much different . " He smiled evilly . " Bobbi lets inc lead . " le took a sip of Cadmann 's beer , smacked approvingly and drew himself a glass . He downed a third of the mug before coming up for air . he followed Cadmann 's gaze top172Mary Ann . " Your senorita  --  she also likes the dance , yes ? " He paused , considering . " I think one can tell much from the way a woman moves to music . The hips , the hands , the way she holds  --  " " Do n't you think about anything but sex ? " " Life is short . One must find one 's great gift , and practice it  --  how do you say ?  --  assiduously . " Cadmann sputtered out a noseful of suds . Together they strolled around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a food booth . Her long black hair twisted and pinned beneath a white paper cap , Bobbi was oblivious to the music piped out from the hall and did n't notice her fiance 's approach . With a long , thin knife , she carefully pared strips from one of three samlon on her cutting board . Movements almost mechanically precise , she sliced those strips into thinner pieces , then positioned them atop formed and pressed blocks of rice . Although not in full production yet , the rice fields were healthy enough for Zack to authorize the release of some of the grain stored aboard Geographic . Carlos leaned across the counter and kissed her wetly . Startled at first , she smooched back , then rubbed noses with him . " Leave me alone for fifteen minutes , then do with me what you will . " " I 'll hold you to that , chiquita . " " You had better . " She squeezed his hands , and there was enough heat in her emerald eyes to scorch stone . That 's what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm taking you down the rapids , mister . " Carlos grabbed a strip of samlon before she could protest and popped it into his mouth . Bobbi waved her knife at him as he skated away , chortling over his mouthful . " What a woman . Do n't you think we 'll make beautiful babies ? " Cadmann reflected for a moment . " The loveliest woman I ever knew was half Japanese and half Jamaican . Assuming the kids take after their mother , they 've got a chance . " The square dance ended with cheers and a thunderous round of applause , and the hall emptied into the quad . Mary Ann worked her way to him through the press , holding a foaming mug . She panted , face glowing and sticky with perspiration . " Cad , you 're such a stick . Why wo n't you dance ? " " War wound . Both legs blown off . Medics screwed up , sewed two left feet on . " She stuck her tongue out.  | " Look on the bright side : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killing ' em at the Waldorf . " " You 're just ashamed of me . You do n't want anyone to see us together . " Carlos nodded sagely . " It is true . Many times he has told of how he likes to hide you away in the dark , covering you with his own body if need be  --  " " Carlos  --  " Martinez took the hint . " I 've got to get ready for the Rapids . " " Turning into a tradition , is n't it ? " " Around here , anything that happens twice is a tradition . " Carlos disappeared into the crowd . The day just felt so damn good . Contests and exhibitions had been running since breakfast . Cadmannhad watched the archery and wrestling , cheering but not competing . Soon would begin the three-day boat race between the honeymooning couples . That he would enjoy ! Then the dance contest . . . silliness , that was really all it was , but he had to admit that he was catching the bug . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beer ? If he could work out a private deal with that worthy  --  say , fresh melon cactus every month in exchange for a keg ? ) He felt more comfortable around the camp than he had in months . But something was pulling him back from wholehearted participation . A voice that was weakeningby the minute . Or the mug . Whatever . He politely squelched a burp . Watching Mary Ann dance was good for him . He had n't had a chance to really compare her with the other women . There was no question that they were a couple : she had fixed the judges , bribed his cornermen and K.O. 'd him before he even knew the fight was on . But it warmed him to feel a healthy physical tug when a twirl or gust of wind raised her skirts . Her hard work up at Cadmann 's Bluff had trimmed away fat and added healthy muscle . The pregnancy did n't show yet , but there was something special about her . She did glow . . . . She squashed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when are you going to  --  " her face changed in the middle of the question , became more mischievous  --  " dance with me ? " Shoot the rapids with me ? The real question was behind the smile , behind the laugh . Itp174lived in the way she leaned against him , letting him feel the muted fire in her belly . What the hell . It 's just a formalization . Why not ? But not now . Not on Holotape , for God and the whole world to see . " Later , " he promised . " You 'll see . " The stands on the north edge of the quad displayed a mosaic of the Colony 's artistic craftsmanship . Cadmann was startled and gratifiedby the breadth and reach of the work on display . These people had not been chosen for artistic talent . They had hidden depths . Here was a kinetic sculpture , a globe filled with clear fluid , holdingiron flakes spiraling in a slow nebula of magnetic flux . There , a painting of Avalon 's twin moons setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mauve sunset . Mounted on a linen-covered table was a sculpture of woven , wired and glued bones . Hundreds of samlon and pterodon bones , sliver thin , formed and painted into a golden bull . As a sumi painting suggests flight or motion with the barest strokes , somehow the bull was challenging and frightened , bursting with animal power and achingvulnerability . The artist 's signature was simply " Sylvia . " Cadmann glanced over his shoulder , suddenly wondering if anyone was watching him study the incredible piece , then forced himself to move on . Next to it was a cameo of native obsidian , and several of Carlos 's scandalous thornwood carvings . They would have been right at home on the wall of a Nepalese temple , and Cadmann was suddenly glad that none of the children were old enough to point and ask embarrassingquestions . The crowd was flowing into the meeting hall . Food must be ready to serve . Cadmann followed the flow . He claimed two empty seats next to Terry 's wheelchair . Mary Ann brought two plates piled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious powdered wasabi horseradish shipped from Earth ; fresh spinach pasta , fresh tomato marinara , whole-grain wheat bread . Most of the food was from the fields and the nets . Avalon was yielding up her harvest , making what reparations she could for the damage done to her newest , strangest children . Terry ate quietly , slowly chewing each mouthful into liquid . Always thin , he seemed to have gained a few pounds since his injury , and it made his face less pinched and severe . " I approve , " he said neutrally.  |p175It  took a beat for Cadmann to realize Terry was talking to him . " Food 's pretty good , " he agreed . " No . You and Mary Ann . Good match . " Terry took another careful mouthful . Cadmann noticed the streaks of gray hair coursing through the curly brown . " How are things up there on the mesa ? " " Nice . Quiet . " Cadmann glanced at Mary Ann . " Wait until Sylviahas the baby . Come on up for dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this damned chair into a Skeeter . " " Sure , we can do that . Or have Carlos make you a folding model . " The projection equipment was wheeled out to the center of the floor . An enlarged holo field shimmered like a heat mirage : the faces and figures against the far wall were pale , wavering ghosts . The lights dimmed . The holo image hardened , and the speakers piped in sound . A motorboat was being lowered down the ravine and into the river below the dam . The boat was a ten-foot black oval , tough syntheticelasticized skin stretched over a metal frame , two low seats and crescent steering wheel mounted in the front . The Skeeter-type engineaft looked too big for the boat . The plastic-sealed knob of a holotape recorder showed above the central mast . It had reached the water . A second , identical boat dropped to join it . Sylvia came to sit between Cadmann and Terry , and she smiled shyly as she lowered herself uncomfortably to her seat . " You look ready , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marnie 's saying next week ! Cadmann , do n't ever get pregnant . " Her complexion was a little blotchy . She wheezed with relief as she settled herself , balancing a plate heaped with food in her hands . " I 'll remember that , " he said . " Last time Mary Ann gets on top . " " Hush . " Someone yelled , " Ta-ta-ta-daah ! " as Elliot Falkland and his fiancee , La Donna , dashed to the center of the floor amid a rowdy chorus of cheers . " Chunky ! " Falkland was all grin and jug ears and peeling tan , with a body almost twice the size of La Donna 's . But the little woman was known as an indefatigable construction worker . BehindCadmann , Andy guffawed something about La Donna " sweatingthat blubber off Elliot before they reach the ocean . " Cadmann raised a cheer as Carlos and Bobbi joined the firstp176couple . Carlos swept off a broad-brimmed hat in a low , gallant bow . Somehow , even dressed in denims , Bobbi managed a shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wore a yellowsafety vest , and skintight rubber pants . He carried a bedroll in his left hand . He and Bobbi would take the boat all the way to the ocean , camping along the way . Three days later they would be picked up by Skeeter , officially married . Cadmann chortled to himself , guessing that Carlos would triplecheckthat the recording equipment was off before turning in for the evenings ... . " Wish me luck , amigo . Falkland has more water experience than we do . " " More than anyone but the samlon . He 's got flippers for feet . " Elliot Falkland and Jerry minded the catfish ponds downriver . Falkland also coordinated the underwater repair operations and had overseen the construction of the dam . That was where he had come to know La Donna . " Anyway , it 's not when you get there , it 's how . " " Loser paints the winner 's house . " " I see your point . Kill him . " " Senor Falkland sleeps with the fishes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos shook hands with the men , kissed the women , then hustledout to supervise the lowering of his boat . Sudden envy stirred in Cadmann . A three-day trip down the river would be a nice honeymoon . But we had ours while we built the camp , and it was fine ! The holo field flickered to a different vantage point . An aerial view of the Skeeter pad swiftly expanded to take in the entire camp . Cadmann 's stomach lurched  --  the reaction he always had when in the air under another 's control . The Skeeter zoomed and veered explosively , rose straight up , then dive-bombed Civic Center . There was clapping , cheering and groaning . The holo field was expanded to fill the room , the magnificationbleaching a little of the color from the image . The three-dimensional aerial panorama was stunning , especially when it veered east , across the Miskatonic . There , Camelot , their new community , was already blocked out . Camelot was n't the cramped curlicue of the first year 's tern/porary dwellings . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such . Now that the crops were established , there was time to work on a more leisurely layout . Camelot covered a square kilometerof homes , boulevards , parks and meditation groves , recreation centers ... . Each plot of land was huge , larger than any of them could have afforded on Earth . Unbelievable wealth by any standard that they had left behind . And room for almost infinite expansion , as their worms and insects and terraforming lichens churned Avalon 's soil into somethingthat the less hardy plants and animals could use . Mineral supplementationand acid balancing created an ideal medium for their crops . Huge homes , ranch houses . Mansions that would one day overlook gracious estates . Room for a man to grow ! The boat engines were no longer ear-jarring burrs , and the Skeeter zipped off to follow the race . The camp cheered , bets flying and changing : Who would be the first through the rapids ? They were twenty kilometers from the northern mountains , and it would be a while before the real action began , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks . In the meantime , the band had apparently rested long enough . Zack mopped his forehead with a bandanna and yelled , " All right  --  we 've got enough time for a couple more turns around the floor . Let 's get it moving ! " He shouldered his fiddle . His fingers danced across the strings , producing sounds of surprising sweetness . Hey there ladies , grab your man Hold that lad as tight as you canSylvia 's hand sneaked around behind Cadmann and tapped Mary Ann twice , sharply , and they exchanged a silent message . It 's a conspiracy . I 'm doomed ... . Mary Ann stood , politely but firmly pulled his plate from his hand . Setting her heels into the composition floor , she dragged him to his feet . Sylvia and Terry and the surrounding crowd howled at his obviousdiscomfort , and Cadmann let that bolster him . " It 's been a long time , " he whispered , " and I am sore wounded , "  |p178relieved  that others were moving out on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments there were squares all over the hall , and Zack was calling and fiddling , the band was playing , and Cadmann 's considerationswere lost in the urge to keep the rhythm and watch his feet . Mary Ann was an excellent square dancer , and she pulled him along with her into the mood . Soon Cadmann was part of an interweavingpattern of human rectangles , do-si-do-ing and skip-stepping as their square broke and re-formed , changed places and swiveled joyously around the floor . Sharp reminders from half-healed wounds eased as he warmed up . The seated observers whistled and clapped and stomped their feet . Before he realized it , Cadmann was grinning and sweating and thoroughly convinced that he was keeping better time than anyone out there . At the end of an hour the dance broke up with a spontaneous cheer and hugs all around , and Cadmann 's drunken whoop was as loud as any . What the hell  --  this is your family . You need them  --  at least Mary Ann does . And do n't be surprised that square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth magic , that 's what it is . What it 's always been . The holofield projector was wheeled back to the center of the quad . Once again the air shimmered , causing squeals of delight  --  Carlos 's boat had breached the rapids , and it was deliciously easy for Cadmann to lose himself in the illusion . He was aboard their boat , hovering directly above Carlos 's shoulders as he spun the wheel , guiding the boat through the rushing water . The water was beginning to churn white , and there an outcroppingof glistening wet rock scraped the side of the inflatable . The boat jumped , and beside him Bobbi screamed delightedly . Elliot 's boat was right behind him , and with a jolt the holofield changed its perspective . La Donna was at the wheel , and the couple were whooping it up more than competing . As the boat hit each spill , they grabbed each other in mock fear , mugging ferociously for the cameras . The water grew whiter , choppier , and the race was really on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towering walls of the northern mountains rose up around them in jagged iron-gray sheets.  |p179Elliot  coaxed his engine to sharper life . With a sure hand La Donna wove them through the rocks . Every dip , every eddy was breathtakingly real , three times larger than life . The water splashed up and licked at them , and Cadmann wiped at his face reflexively . Elliot 's boat shot a short falls , landed flatbellied , with a crash and a whoop from the hall . The image switched back to Carlos , who was looking back over his shoulder at the approaching boat . Cadmann 's palms were sweaty and shaking . It was almost impossible to resist the urge to roll up his sleeves and grab a pole : there was a rock spur ! Ah , good . Bobbi , with movements as quick and light as the flicker of a whip , nudged their boat away from it . Everyone was cheering now , and it grew riotous as the image switched from one perspective to the other ; the gap between the boats narrowed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowedas it sluiced through a gap between two towering slabs of rock , and Carlos narrowly held his lead , Elliot coming up fast . Then , as they came out of it , and the way widened again , Elliot rammed Carlos from the rear . La Donna squealed as their boat hit a rock and lurched in a drunken circle . Elliot cursed fluidly as Carlos 's craft shot past . Elliot 's boat spun twice , dipped and swung perilously and then finally stabilized . The hologram switched to Carlos 's craft and a triumphant Bobbi shaking her fist at Elliot as they widened the distance . Carlos gunned the motor fully , and their boat rose in the water and shot north toward the ocean . Far behind them now , Elliot opened his throttle and skimmed along the surface , churning the water into white as he roared in pursuit . Rock walls flashed by . Cadmann 's heart thundered as he remembered the sheer speed of the boats , their near-hydrofoil design that kept a minimum of prow in the water , minimizing drag . Fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone yelled , and suddenly they were with Carlos 's boat , and it was in trouble . Something was terribly wrong , and the boat was spinningAnother rock ? But Carlos 's face was distorted , and he was grabbingfor Bobbi , set-canting something unintelligible . The boat seemedp180to be collapsing , the holoimage buckling and blurring . The last image that they had was of rocks and water and churning foam , and a brief glimpse of Bobbi tumbling through the foam toward the rocks , thrashing her hands frantically as she disappeared beneath the surface of the water.  |p181All  men think all men mortal , save themselves . EDMUND YOUNG , Night ThoughtsFIRST THERE WAS a humming . Mama was a good distance from the water , and her mouth was full of blood and feathers . She looked for insects swarming . If she found the nest she would eat it whole ... . But the swarm sound was louder now , and too uniform , and there were no dark clouds that could be insects . Something strange , in unfamiliar terrain . Mama made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The humming was louder as she reached the water . It came around a bend upstream . She could n't see the intruder 's shape ; it was too distant yet . But it moved on the water , not through it . Moved fast . Finally . Mama 's eyes were above the water . The snorkel between her eyes drew air ; her lungs heaved . There was rage in her , and something else : sphincter muscles relaxed back of her neck , speed began dripping into her blood , and her entire body began to fizz . The vulnerable snorkel withdrew into her head . Sic watched the intruderp182come  --  not quite toward her , she had n't been seen yet  --  then why was the intruder already fast ? But Mama was fast now , and she moved . This was her territory now . She knew it that well , she had been here that long . Mine . She too was almost above the water as she reached the intruder . She struck from the side . For a bare instant she knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taste like metal but not as strong , rupturedon impact and tore in her jaws . No meaty texture , no taste of blood . Not won : lost ! Tricked ! And where was her enemy ? The metallic skin filled with water and began to sink . Confusing tastes drifted in its wake . Things thrashed the water in slow motion , beasts caught between fighters . She ignored them . Where was her rival ? Still fast , Mama streaked for her cave before she could be blindsided . At the underwater mouth she turned . She could n't be attacked now except from the front . Now there was time . Mama lifted her eyes above the water and watched two beasts thrashing . If meat were suddenly snatched beneath the surface , she would know that her enemy was below . But the prey were swept downstream , thrashing , trying to reach the river 's edge . They reached shore unmolested , and scrambled from the water unmolested . Mama had been tricked . She had bitten something , but it was n't meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , it skimmed across the water , almost toward her . It swerved away as Mama streaked toward it . The intruder was fully on speed , and young , Mama thought . She herself had never moved so fast . . . but its turn was too slow . She was on it , and her teeth closed with terrible strengthOn thin , tough , tasteless skin , and flesh that ruptured and bone that broke  --  fragile bone , prey blood , prey meat , with no taste of speed . Not at all the flesh of her own kind , and she 'd been tricked again ! She had barely slowed . She kept moving , fleeing the site of her kill , curving toward safety , sliding across the bucking surface of the water . Where is my enemy ? Where ? Behind her , meat thrashed in the water , then subsided . More prey was climbing the cliff , unmolested , and that was hardly surprising . In the middle of a duel one does not pause to dine.  |p183How  may I lure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prey . Challenge ! CARLOS MARTINEZ was shaking : with cold , with shock and pain from the fractured cheekbone and the flap of scalp torn away when he wrapped himself around Bobbi 's unconscious body to shield her from the rocks . She lay curled on her side , flat stomach spasming , river water still trickling in a brown stream from her mouth , eyes glazed , but open and wandering blindly . ( Alive , vivo ! flashed insanely into his mind , alive , vivo ! , scrambling his thoughts . ) She was in shock , and probably concussed , but all that really mattered for the moment was that she was alive . He gripped his head tightly , fighting the ringing and the pain . In a few moments they quieted , and he massaged Bobbi 's rib cage firmly as he looked about him . Later in the year , when the snow from the northern mountains melted , the spot he stood on and another thirty meters of tumbled rock would be submerged . In another ninety days there might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and Bobbi might have been dashed against steeply sloping walls of naked rock . A few hundred meters north or south the water dashed against sheer cliff . As bad and barren as this shelf was , it still represented something very near a miracle . He would have to fight rapids or climb to get off the beach . He managed a quick prayer of thanks that he would n't have to try . Rescue would come soon . Thank goodness for the holo links ! The camp would have seen exactly what happened . His head throbbed . He kept up the steady , gentle massage on Bobbi 's ribcage . Her eyes fluttered open weakly . " Carlos . . . what happened ? " " We hit a rock . " That had to be it . That was all that it could be . So why was there a wet red flag on part of the memory ? Something trying to hide from him and warn him at the same instant ? Carlos ripped his shirt off and wiped her face with it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her head . Not long now . Elliot Falkland would be fighting upriver even now . He managed a smile to think of the rotund engineer piloting his way through the rapids . Bobbi would have treatment within the hour , and tomorrow they would be able to laugh about this.  |p184The  Colony would already be sending out Skeeters . He thought that he could hear the hum of a distant engine . " I 'll be right back , chiquita , " he said , and kissed her softly . Her lips felt bruised and flushed . She reached for him , gripped at the wet cloth of his shirt . " No . Do n't leave me . Please . " There was help out in the river . It tore him , but he pried her fingers loose . " Shh . Shh . I love you . I 'll be right back , I promise . O.K. ? " Shaking , unconvinced , she nodded her head . Carlos scrambled over the rocks to the south , to a higher point where he could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rush of the water , silver-white with dark patches as it exploded over rocks and took sudden dips and turns . To either side the mountain walls were steep , at least forty near-vertical meters of iron-gray , roughly weathered rock . The crusty gray was interrupted by bands of lighter color . High tides ? Geological separations ? His mind was n't working properly yet . From the new vantage point , he heard nothing , could see nothing , and that puzzled him . Where was Elliot ? Then he saw . He 's been wrecked too ! Dear God . Elliot lay inert on a patch of rocks by the far shore . He must have been thrown clear . The second boat was no more than a few dark shreds of fabric which still fluttered , wedged into rocks . There was no sign of La Donna . A dark , spreading stain grew from beneath Elliot 's head and dripped down into the rushing water . Carlos 's stomach went sour and tight . I 've got to help himAnd then Carlos saw it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was what his subconscious had screamed to him . He had caught a bare glimpse of that dark juggernaut churning through the water , smashing through the side of the boat ... . The foam suddenly churned , and the black thing erupted from the water , flashing up into Elliot with the speed of a striking snake . Elliot 's body jerked once , massively , and disappeared into the waves . Something that felt like a cloak of cold slime swept over Carlos , numbing him . But in its wake his mind began to work . His first conclusion was inescapable : If he did not think very clearly , Bobbi was going to die . What was there to do ? The monster would find them . He 'd hep185insane to assume anything else . They could n't hope to outrun that creature under the best of circumstances . With Bobbi barely conscious , it would take a miracle to escape . Do something . Odds do n't matter . Act ! In half an hour , no more , we 'll be rescued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race ! They must already know what they 're up against . And Cadmann 's back in camp . Carlos scrambled back down to Bobbi . She wound her arms around his neck weakly , and her black hair streamed back over her shoulders like seaweed . " Carlos ? What ? " " We 've got to move . " " Why ? " Her head lolled back as if her neck were fractured . She coughed wetly . " Why ca n't we stay here ? I hurt . I 'm so sleepy . " Lie , you bastard . " We need to be at a better vantage point for the Skeeters  --  if they 're going to pick us up . " He lifted her to her feet . She seemed a feather . " Come on , hon. " He grunted as she found her feet . He bent , unknotted the pillow he had made of his shirt and slipped it over one arm . He half pulled , half lifted Bobbi up over the first eastern row of boulders , then took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river  --  but another twenty-five meters up the rocks and they would be against the cliff . No hope there . The mountain stretched above them , a splintered pale fortress carved from the primeval clay by ragged knife strokes . Above the ridge the clouds that had been fleecy and white an hour ago had darkened , were tinged with black as though heralding a sudden thundershower . The air had gone chill . He might be able to climb that wall , but there was no way in hell that Bobbi could make it . And there was no place to make a stand here , nothing that would afford protection . What it looked like , he thought grimly , was a damn good place to die . There was an answer . Both of them could die , or one , or just maybe neither . But they had to separate . Watching his footfalls carefully , he carried her along with him , pulling , coaxing , babying her along . Scraping arms and legs , protectingher as best he could , but aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her to shelter . Have to get her to shelter . . . The . going was steep now , and twice they almost fell . Once they did , sliding and skinning hands and knees . Bobbi was a little morep186alert now , and more help . She managed to thrust a leg out , halting a tumble . He laughed weakly and kissed her forehead , and then pushed her up another few meters . Muscles tensing , tendons in his back stretching with the strain , afraid to stop for rest or to look back to see what was following them out of the water , Carlos helped Bobbi up the sharp incline . The pounding in his head grew worse . They slipped again , and this time her thigh caught on a sharp spur and made a nasty gash . Damn ! He whipped off his shirt and wrapped it around her leg quickly , before it could leak blood and destroy the tiny inspiration that had begun to flower . Above them and to their left was a shallow ledge , all but invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe . " Come on , just keep moving . " She must have sensed or seen some of the dread in his manner , because she was glancing back down at the river now , at the churning white and pale rushing blue . Carlos lowered her to the shelf . Perfect . There was even a slight overhang . If she crawled back into it , she would be safe . If all went well .. . He untied the hastily applied dressing and knotted the shirt into a tourniquet , applying it above the wound . Blood oozed in a sluggish stream . Good enough . One way or the other , it would do . He looked back out at the river . Nothing yet . Now he could remember : the image of Elliot 's body disappearing beneath the surface , fat arms and legs slapping the water once . And another image : that of the first creature back at the Colony as it dashed through the searchlights in a nightmare of fanged and taloned rage . He shivered . " Now listen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied to you . We 're not up here to make it easier for a Skeeter to pick us up . We 're up here because there 's another of those creatures in the water . I 've got to go , to make a trail to lead him away from you . " Her eyes widened . Her fingernails tore at his arm . " But Carlos ... " " Listen to me , " he whispered fiercely . " You 've seen what those bastards can do . I do n't want to give up what little chance we have . " Bobbi moved clumsily , trying to sit up . The blood trickling from the gash began to pulse more strongly . " Your leg is bad . Do n't make it worse . " Carlos forced her backp187clown . The leg ! He had to do something , but there was no time at all , only hope . " I have a chance , " he said . " I do n't think those things can climb as well as a human being . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can climb that damn mountain and keep it busy until someone gets here . It ca n't be long . When I 'm gone , climb as far back into the shadows as you can . Keep pressure on the tourniquet as long as you can . " " Carlos  --  " His mind stuttered , trying to find the right words , something brave and reassuring , and could n't . Finally he just held her , saying again , " I love you . " He left her . He climbed down again and examined her perch . Bobbi could n't be seen from below . Not seen , but what about smell ? The first stop was the rock that had gashed her leg . It was bloodstained , and he searched until he found a fist-sized stone . He pounded at the spur until it shattered . He scooped up the fragments and flung them as far as he could . There was no guarantee that his ploy would work , but one thing the knew for certain : he had to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the only way that he could , thankful that there was still fluid in his bladder , enough to leave a trail from beneath the bloodstainedrock well to the right , away from Bobbi . He began to climb . He was quickly blowing for air . How long had it been since the crash ? Twenty minutes ? It seemed an eternity . But the Skeeter would be coming ! We lived longer than I thought we would . He was up the grade above Bobbi now , and he saw that she had crawled farther between the rocks . Good girl . Now he was high enough on the cliff to see down into the river . There was the blood slick where Elliot had met the rocks . Beyond were limp black fabric and boat fragments at the river turn . To the south , there was nothing but the rushing river . Where were the rescueSkeeters ? Where was  --  ? Oh , Jesus . There was a movement iii the water , and something moved up out of it , as steady and inexorable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos cried out R tle  --  xivcly.  |p188It  was the same as the first creature , only larger , half again as large , and fleshier . It paused as if getting its bearings , then stared right at himFor one crazy , shameful instant he thought , Let it have Bobbi . Let it have anything . Then it blurred , as if shot from the water by compressed air . It crossed the rocks , paused for an instant , then took off again , cutting an angular trail up toward the wall  --  paused and exploded into a series of zigzags that was like nothing so much as a crazy pinball game , then hit the wall and ran almost straight up at him . Carlos tried to close his eyes , to wait in darkness for a swift and terrible death , but did n't have time . It was , it wasIt shot right past him and kept going until it perched on a rock shelf halfway between him and the top of the mesa . The creature crouched above him . It ignored Carlos entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for the rapidly turning head it stood entirely still , yet gave an illusion of motion , like an engine revving in neutral . What was it looking for ? More boats ? Whatever it was doing , it was n't watching Carlos . It can move . Faster than anything I have ever seen . Faster than anything I have ever heard of . I ca n't outrun it . It must have seen me , but it does n't act like it . MaybeThe cliff was steep . A fall would kill him . Better that than the monster , he thought , but he could n't make himself believe it enough to jump . He made his hands stop trembling , reached down , found a handhold , tested it . It was firm . He lowered himself a few inches , found a new hold , andThe creature snarled : a high-pitched scream like a drill biting into metal . Carlos looked up into its vast dark disklike eyes . The message in them was unmistakable : Where the fuck do you think you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath . The creature watched him for another few seconds , then turned away . Carlos pressed himself into the rock wall . Between terror and confusion , he could n't guess what his next move might be . But what does it think it 's doing ? Is it crazy ? A crazy thought , indeed . Carlos laughed , and it turned to look at him , and the laugh stuck jaggedly in his throat . It went back to scanning the river.  |p189AT  THE SHORE was injured prey , dying . Two more prey were climbing the cliff , characteristically clumsy . The enemy must regard these as hers . Mama planned her move , and thenChallenge . Mama charged across the water , straight at the feebly moving prey . Her jaw clamped on its hind leg . She dived beneath the froth , released the meat at once and swam for her life . Three seconds later she surfaced far downstream , to watch her enemy come to reclaimstolen meat . The corpse tumbled unmolested . Her enemy was too clever , far too clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one had disappeared . The last was halfway up the cliff . Mama studied the cliff . It was n't sheer , but the thought of being stranded there while something came at her was one she rejected at once . . . and retrieved , and toyed with . She could see most of the cliff , and no danger showed there . Her enemy might be in the water or at the top of the cliffs . She never doubted it was watching . There were footholds along the cliff . Take any path too fast and she might be stranded in midair , falling toward waiting jaws . Motionlessin white froth , with only her eyes showing , Mama chose her path . Then she moved . Across the seething water . Up along cracks in the rock , now quick , now slow , dancing her route , ready to face death with her footing firm . In seconds she was halfway up the cliff , poised on a ledge above live prey . Challenge . Come and get what 's yours !  |p190No  man quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prejudices " BUT WHAT could have happened ? " Zack demanded . Cadmann guided Skeeter One through the twisting canyon , barely noticing the naked rock walls rising to either side . " Do n't know . " The west side of the canyon was growing rapidly darker . The smaller sun cast shadows much sharper than he 'd been used to on Earth . It made judging distances harder . Cadmann moved the Skeeter toward the brightly lit eastern wall . It was banded in orange and pale reds . " Do n't know . Damn pretty country here . " " Yeah , sure  --  how can you be so calm ? " " I 'm not , but what 's the use of getting excited until there 's something to do ? " " Yeah . You 're right . " Zack took a deep breath . " Those walls are pretty . Like the Australian outback . Ever go there ? " " No , the U.N . never needed soldiers out there . " " It was a rock . Cadmann , it had to he a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " Why not ? And we do n't know that Elliot 's boat is gone  --  " " Like hell we do n't . " Cadmann 's mouth was a grim line . " Look , Zack , you can kid yourself about interpretation , but not about what we heard , and the last thing we heard was La Donna screaming . And the last thing we saw ? " " You saw . I ran the tape and I did n't see what you saw . " " Oh , maybe I did n't see it either . There was something . Somethingdark in the water near Carlos 's raft , something that I swear was moving across the current ... well , no , I wo n't swear . " Cadmann spoke into his comcard . " Skeeter Two . " " Here , " Stu Ellington answered . " We 're coming up to the bend . You go right across the canyon , down to the rapids , and turn back . We 'll start the search at the upstreamend . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " " Me too , " Zack said carefully . " I 'm still hoping we do n't find  --  " " Nobody had to remind you to bring your rifle . And damned if that spare clip does n't look loaded with incendiaries . " Zack grunted . " I 'm not going to be stupid about it . " Skeeter Two rounded the bend ahead . Cadmann had just made the turn when Stu 's voice came through the radio . " I 've spotted wreckage downstream , but no sign of  --  holy shit ! Nine o'clock . " Cadmann 's eyes flashed to the left , and for a moment all he saw was the sheer rock face of the gorge . Then he focused , and he saw the creature , perched like a house cat on a bookshelf , only a dozen meters above a stranded Carlos . " Straight in . Surprise . Shoot when you have a target , " Cadmann ordered . It 's not moving . Just sitting there . A little closer  --  " Zack , make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and head for the river . Stu ! " He shouted into the radio . " You check the river ! Look for other monsters . " " Look for Elliot and La Donna and Bobbi , too , " Zack said . Cadmann spun the Skeeter to hover twenty meters from the canyon wall . " Now ! " he shouted . Zack shouldered his rifle and squeezed off a burst . Spent shells whirred out of the rifle breech in a glittering arc . The monster twisted , turned toward the Skeeter , then swiveled wildly , searching the river and the cliff above , finally looking back at the Skeeter . Cadmann touched a button and spoke into the tiny microphonep192attached to his helmet . " Carlos ! Hang in there , amigo . " His amplified voice echoed through the canyon . Carlos was trapped , frozen except for one foot which slipped as he fought for a toehold . His hands and arms were stretched painfully taut . His head twisted back to look at them , then he pressed his cheek back into the cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Zack demanded . It was paying more attention to its sides than to Skeeter One . It licked at the bullet holes . Zack fired again , a long burst . The creature recoiled against the rock . Its gaze rested on them for an instant , then its head twitched to the left and the right with the speed of a hummingbird 's wings . Then with no warning at all it dove off the cliff , ran down the side faster than a rock could fall , hit the ground and sped for the river . Cadmann could n't pivot the Skeeter fast enough to see it dive between the rocks . Skeeter Two was just whizzing back across the river when the creature disappeared with a splash . Cadmann spoke through the amplifier . " Okay , amigo , you can come down now . " He switched to radio . " Stu . Did you  --  ? " " I 've got it , Cad . Not a clear view : there 's too much disturbance in the water . But it looks like there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got it penned . " Gotcha ! Cadmann crowed silently . " Hover . If it shows up , blow it away . " " Roger  --  but Cad  --  we have the remains of both rafts . And Elliot'sdead . We ca n't find La Donna or Bobbi . " The news hit home savagely , dulling the flash of pleasure . " Stay over the cave . We 'll look for the ladies . " " What about Carlos ? " " He 's moving , " Cadmann said . " When he gets to the ledge we 'll see if he needs help . Nothing I can do from here right now . " He turned back to Zack . " I could set you down where you can wait for Carlos .... " " No . " Zack squeezed out each word . " This is n't going to get any easier if we wait . " Cadmann pulled back on the stick , and the Skeeter peeled away from the wall and headed downriver , looking for what they really did n't want to find. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the water boiling over the rocks . Somewhere beneath the foam was the monster who had killed Elliot and La Donna , and wounded Bobbi . " You 're going to die down there , " he whispered . There was a sudden sound behind him , and Cadmann wheeled instinctively , rifle coming to bear without conscious thought . Carlos gave a weak smile , shaking a cigarette out of a plastic pack . " Smoke ? " " No , thanks . " Several different emotions warred on Carlos 's face , and he finally lowered the package . " Absurd , is n't it ? I mean , to want to give you something . A cigarette . . . a handshake ? " Cadmann extended his hand . " Thanks , Cadmann . I never understood what you went through until now . " His dark face was relaxed , his voice very quiet . " You 've forgotten your accent . " Carlos gave a short bark of laughter . " Yeah . Wait around . Bullshithas a way of piling back up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shaking badly . " Bobbi will be all right . Wo n't she ? She wo n't wake up . Why am I asking you ? " His eyes lost focus , were gazing into the wall of rock on the far side of the gorge . Too well , Cadmann knew what they were seeing . Skeeter Two was still hovering over the Miskatonic . " If there is n't another exit from the cave , then we 've got the damn thing pinned , is that it ? " " That 's it . " Skeeter Six was humming in , loaded cargo hoist swinging pendulously . Cadmann looked at Carlos critically . " Are you fit ? " Carlos ground out the half-smoked cigarette . " I 'm shaking . I 'll be over it . And the best way is to kill that thing . What are your ideas ? " " You 'll see . " The cargo hoist beneath the Skeeter was full , and the pilot loweredit . When it was down and released , the Skeeter touched down and Jerry dismounted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his left hand . Skeeter Six took Two 's place over the river . Jerry clapped Carlos on the back , shook hands with Cadmann . " Camp is in an uproar , not a panic . We 're moving . "  |p194They  headed back to the temporary shelter , where Stu and Andy were unpacking equipment . Zack had flown Bobbi back to camp first . There was very little said , and not much show of nerves . Just swift , purposeful action . With a grinding hum , another Skeeter bore in men and equipment . Cadmann grunted satisfaction to himself . The Colony 's response was swift and sensible . Maybe it took tragedy to bring out the survivor in them . They walked over to join the man and woman dismounting from the newest Skeeter . Cadmann nodded in greeting . " We 've got to move quickly . It 's badly wounded now  --  " " We may be able to capture it , " Jerry interjected . " We need to capture it alive if at all possible , Cadmann . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take any chances with it . I 'm laying the tightest trap I can . If everything goes perfectly , we may be able to take it alive . If one little thing fucks up , we kill it . " " And if more than a little thing goes wrong . . . " Carlos said grimly . Together they walked to the edge of the rocks overlooking the swirling depths of the Miskatonic . They could see little . Cadmann touched his headphone . " Any sign of activity ? " " None yet . Flash on the tiniest movement . " " That 's the way we want it . " The river bottom was dark , and cold , and somewhere down there was what Cadmann wanted . " You 're mine , " he whispered . " What was that , amigo ? " " Amigo . " Cadmann looked at him in disgust . " I said I knew it was too good to last . "  |p195One  of the greatest blessings of virtue is the contempt of death . He who has learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready to die frees us from all bondage and thralldom . MONTAIGNE , EssaysCADMANN WIPED AT his faceplate twice before he realized that the stain was on the inside . He waved to one of the waiting spearmen , got a nod and surfaced . Fresh air tasted good . He removed the faceplate and spat into it , rubbed out the fog and rinsed it . Better . The Miskatonic churned around him . Even with weight belt and tether line , the current threw his balance off , increased irritability , drained his strength . The wet suit slowed his every motion . And well worth it ! Many a man had survived a shark attack because of his wet suit . A wet suit did n't taste like blood ; and if something tore into him anyway , it could hold him together like a body bandage until a doctor could reach him . But he felt slow . He dared not hurry . Methodically he prepared himself for war , knowing that the enemy would interrupt him when it chose . Anchoring the net had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mud and rock around the cave , a third man hovering back , underwater lamp and spear gun at the ready . The net itself was stronger than steel c ble and as thin as spider silk , a synthetic organic polymer that was predicted to last for hundreds of years of ordinary use . No lesser durability would have been approved for shipment aboard Geographic . Ordinary use . Cadmann smiled thinly into his faceplate . This evening 's exercise would hardly be considered that . He reached back over his shoulder to adjust the re-breather apparatus . Very light , very compact , intended for underwater repairs on a docked Minerva . It was certified for an hour of swimming , half that of " vigorous activity . " It 'll do . Half an hour fighting that thing and one or the other of us wo n't need oxygen any more . Okay , down we go " Cadmann , this is Sylvia . " " Go . " It was impossible to speak distinctly into the throat microphone . " I 've analyzed the photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may spend more time underwater than on land . " " Uh-huh . " I already thought of that one . And they 're hard enough to kill on land .. . . " Thanks . More ? " " No  --  except , be careful . " " Uh-huh . " He stretched and dove down to join the others at their work at the net . He felt the reassuring pressure of Zack 's " monsterkiller " spear gun against his thigh . Moscowitz had promised them a stopper . Joe Sikes 's machine shop had delivered it . The device looked like a pistol with a webbed black plastic grip . Immediately in front of the handpiece was an ammunitionclip that looked as if it were constructed for shotgun shells . This was almost true : special cartridges drove carbon-steel-tipped spears carrying enough high explosive to blow the engine out of a Skeeter . This should stop them , and the net should hold them . Hah . The net had better stop them . This island is starting to look infested with the bastards . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunners watching the work . One waved back and went to join Carlos on the other side of the cave . Carlos had opened his wet suit down the front . One of the spearp197guns was strapped to his leg . He worked methodically , carefully , but he never stopped . He 'd done that all day , driving Cadmann on with his example , working through exhaustion , through fear . . . as if the devil was on his tail . Welcome to hell , Carlos . A silver trail of bubbles bobbled from the side of Carlos 's mouth , and he gave Cadmann a " thumbs up . " Cadmann wiggled the meterlongbarbed-steel pinions holding down his corners of the net . No give to them at all . If the rock held , the net would . A catfish and a samlon swam by almost in tandem , the samlon close behind , chasing playfully . Cadmann allowed himself a twinge of hunger . The fish were getting big and fat , especially the samlon . If he 'd had time , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascend . Cadmann 's aching muscles sighed relief . Their heads broke the surface . Both scrambled out in almost comic haste , sucking air . The sun had dipped below the west wall and there were only a few minutes of light left . Armed men and women surrounded the temporary camp . Packingand crating from boxes of hastily shipped equipment were piled randomly into a central area ; no one had taken the time to collect or remove them , but they were out of the way , no shelter for monsters to hide behind . Two machine guns occupied the top of an empty crate . A faint burning smell hung in the air . The low steady vibration of a flare drill tickled Cadmann 's feet . An electric generator hummed near the shelter . A series of cables linked it to batteries of portable lights set up on every side , giving the entire area a bright greenishyellowglow . Cadmann and Carlos stripped off their mouthpieces and gloves . Cadmann opened the zipper on his wet suit . Skeeters glided across the river . Their searchlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive and incendiary rounds patrolled in tight shifts while the technicians erected their tents and tested their equipment . The canyon thrummed with the sound of a Skeeter bringing in a second generator . Carlos pointed to the machine guns and patrols . " They take you seriously , amigo . " Sure . Now . " Good . " A tent flap raised , and Jerry waved a thin arm at them . " Over here . "  | " Join you in dos minutos , Cad . Want to get a gel on my facecut.  --  Cad nodded , then crossed to the tent . He had to duck going in . A small gas heater burned in the corner , and the air was toasty . " What do we have , Jer ? " " Everything you wanted , " Jerry answered . He held up a plastic pouch . Its contents seemed darkly purple in the artificial light . " This should do it . " " Great . How are the other preparations going ? Andy ? " The big engineer spread out a sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows a network of caves going back into the mountains for at least a kilometer . It would be death to go in there and take it on its own terms . " " There 's no way in hell to kill it and be sure it 's dead unless we go in . You know that . " " Swell . Shit , man . I do n't like it at all . " " Have to burn the egg sac , " Cadmann said . Jerry grinned . " I 've read Red Planet too . " His look became serious . " All right , I grant you that . There may be young . Or eggs . And right now it 's wounded . There is n't a better time , but I still do n't like it . " No more do I , but you just do the best you can up here . Do it right , and we wo n't have anything to do but collect a corpse . " " Corpses , if it has young . All right . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent where a tripod-mounted laser drill burned into the ground . The men working the drill were shielded and wore goggles against the glare and the fat sparks that popped and flew like flaming moths . Sizzling melted rock bubbled up out of the cavity , flowed a few inches , then turned sluggish and puddled . Thirty meters away , a second drill was searing into the rock , and just beyond a rise Cadmann could see the sharp , flickering lights of yet another . The laser shut down abruptly , and someone yelled , " We 're through ! " " Lay the pipe through . " Twelve meters of flexible metal piping was run through while the rock was still hot . The top end was fastenedto a pump and a twenty-gallon drum . " What have we got there ? " Cadmann asked , curious now.  | " Call it napalm , only nastier . Burns longer , hotter . Top layer will vaporize . When we touch it off there 'll be a shock wave that should kill anything down there . Its waste products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " " Just like Godzilla . Oxygen destroyer  --  " Andy laughed . " Always wondered why they had that film aboard Geographic . This stuff is n't magic , but it 's pretty nasty . Homemade , too . " " So was foo-foo gas . ' " " What the hell was that ? " " Gasoline and old-fashioned granular laundry detergent . Big factorin the 1995 Argentine revolution . " " Viva la revolution . " Andy grinned . " Stealing my lines , corn padre ? " Carlos joined them . His facial scar was sealed tight under a waterproof astringent salve . " You 'll get your royalty payment . " Andy breathed deeply . " You guys ready ? " Cadmann and Carlos nodded . " Then let 's do it . " CARLOS held the spear gun at the ready this time , while Cadmann worked the tip of his knife into the plastic unit of human blood Jerry had brought from the clinic . The pouch was rubbery-firm for a moment , then , as its skin was pierced , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave . The blood streamed through the lamplight in dark tendrils , then was sucked into the cave and vanished . If it worked , the thing would come streaking out of the cave and into the net . And Cadmann did n't care if the effect was like pushing a pound of Cheddar through a cheese grater . Carlos dimmed his light . Together they waited . And waited , clinging to anchor spikes . Cadmann listened to the hiss of the river and the steady sigh of his own exhalations as he pushed them into the re-breather . And waited . Nothing . After ten minutes , they surfaced . Cadmann spit out his mouthpieceas he climbed up , and swore savagely . Zack helped Carlos past a slippery patch . " Let 's go to plan two . " Andy was manning the pump , awaiting a hand signal from Zack before he sent the explosive liquid flowing into the ground.  | " If it 's in there , " he said with obvious satisfaction , " this is going to make it very unhappy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was suddenly aware of fatigue and cramped muscles . Somewhere someonewas cooking , and the fragrance of lamb stew with fresh vegetables was suddenly overwhelming . Carlos appeared , holding two heaping bowls . " They should give medals for this , Martinez . " " By the time the paperwork goes through , we 'll both be dead and gone . " Too true . " The stew was thickened with leftover Year Day rice , and utterly delicious . Cadmann leaned back against a rock , listening to the useful bustle around him , warmed by the food and the nearness of his friend . The clouds shrouded the stars . The twin moons must have alreadyrisen , but another two or three hours would pass before they were visible this low in the gorge . All there was now was the steady gurgle of the water and the human sounds around them . For some reason that he could n't name , Cadmann felt a sudden , strong urge to see the stars , the moons . Why ? Because you 're going down there tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary Ann . " His teeth wrestled with an undercooked , mildly seasoned portion of lamb . It resisted for a moment , then his teeth found the grain . " I 'm hoping she 's not worried . " " Si . I was thinking of Bobbi . I hope she 's well , out of surgery , and not worrying about me . It is not good for las palomitas to worry . " " Especially when there 's nothing to worry about . " " Precisely . " They turned to face each other , and Cadmann managed to hold his bland expression for about five seconds before both gave in to a wave of grim laughter . " Clear the holes ! " Andy shouted , and the hose was pulled from the ground , the pumps and barrels wheeled away toward the rock wall . A wire was run down the pipes and its end clipped into a deto/nation switch . Andy came over to sit with Cadmann and Carlos , twenty meters from the hole . " You ready for this ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the least you can do is give us time to swim for it . " " Naw . We 've got at least eight meters of rock under us . We 've already identified enough outlets to release the pressure . Fireworks no . Earthquakes yes . Ready ? " " As we 'll ever be . " He switched on his radio . " Two and three ? " " Standing ready . " " Good news . On zero . Three , two , one  --  " Cadmann squinted as Andy said " zero ! " sharply , and twisted the detonator toggle . There was a dull thud that shook the rock beneath them , and a jet of flame-tinged smoke erupted from the hole . There was a second , more violent tremor , and a tickle of panic shot up Cadmann 's spine . Then silence except for a steady hissing sound and a jet of grayish smoke from the hole . Cadmann sneezed against a horrid chemical smell . Andy got to his feet . " If it 's down there , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get them all killed . " How long before we can go down to check ? " " How quick can you get wet ? " " Got it . Zack ? " There was no reply , and he raised his voice . " Zack ? " The camp administrator 's voice came in over the radio . " Is that Cadmann bellowing for me , or has one of our elephants gone into rut ? " " We have n't hatched any elephants yet . " " Then put Cadmann on . " The smoke streaming from the ground was taking on a darker color . Got you ... I hope . " Zack , Cad here . I need those dozen men you promised me . " " You 'll have them . You 're sure you have to go in , Cad ? It 's probablydead . " Zack hesitated . " No , dammit , probably ' is n't going to help me sleep any better . We 'll Skeeter in the last two from camp . ' fake about twenty minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time for a short nap or ap202long prayer . Or another bowl of stew . Come on . " " Are n't you worried about cramps ? " " Nah . I 've been through menopause . " Cadmann stood , shaking the stiffness from his knees . " You 're a very sick man , Carlos . Probably your most endearing trait . "  |p203Beowulf  spoke : " Let your sorrow end ! It is better for us all to avenge our friends , not mourn them forever . I promise you  --  she shall have no shelter , no hole to hide , no towering tree , no deep bottom of a lake where her sins may hide . " BeowulfTHE WATER WAS DARK and cool , shallow now and calmer than the rushing currents of the Miskatonic behind them . Cadmann 's head broke the surface and he held his handlamp up . Its beam probed the blackness as he climbed out onto the limestone gallery . Carlos surged out of the water , and their combined beams gave Cadmann a grasp of the dimensions of the chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was dappled with some kind of webbed moss . Something far to the left gave off a faintly purplish luminescence . Although there was no smoke in the air , it had to be rich with nerve poison . He did n't dare remove his mask . The chamber was too small to hide anything much larger than a rat ; the torchlight splashed bright and hard against the farthest wall . Shallow pools stood beneath embryonic stalactites . A slow , steady drip of water raised echoes everywhere . The rest of the men were out of the water now , and Cadmann adjusted his throat mike.  | " All right . Anyone see anything ? Jerry ? " " Not a thing . I think it went deeper back . " " Agreed . " A slick , rounded hump of rock was the next barrier . Cadmann clambered to the top and played his torch down into the darkness . " Andy ! " The engineer responded with a hand-held scanning unit . He clambered up to the top of the rock and perched there . Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least twenty meters . Just rock and wet . Do we go for it ? " " You got anything better to do ? " " Not a thing . " Cadmann , Andy and Carlos hammered pitons into the rock , then attached cables and ropes and climbed cautiously down the side into a lower body of water . The gloom was absolute , as if no ray of light had penetrated this deeply since the Miskatonic first cut this chamber from the rock . Tiny blind things moved sluggishly aside as he swam through the murk . Some wriggled like eels , and others scuttled along the bottom of the pool like crabs . They groped through the dark , trying to avoid him , gliding through his torchlight as if totally unaware of it . No sound but the faint re-breather hiss in his ears , no natural light at all now . Just eleven men and two sterile women swimming silently through the murk . And we 've all made our deposits in the sperm bank . The rock walls began to close in from the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other as his finned feet flailed for balance before he found the right path . " Andy , " he croaked into his throat mike . He suddenly remembered the first time he had tried to use a mouthpiece and a throat mike at the same time : he had swallowed about two cups of Barrier Reef brine . " How far did you say these caves extend ? " " I did n't . All we can do is search for an hour , hope that we can find our target . Target . ' Sounds like I expect it to be standing still , does n't it ? Anyway , then we make our way back out . " Each of the thirteen members of the team carried two additional re-breather cartridgesin their bulky backpacks . That gave them a total of two hours  --  but Cadmann had no interest in letting things get down to the last few seconds . Fifty min/utes in , fifty out . Twenty-minute margin for error . If they could n't find the corpse , they had to assume that the creature was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a doubled guard and a continuously activated mine field around the camp . And constant worry until we know it 's dead . The walls widened out again . Cadmann surfaced cautiously . He held the handlamp up to shine the beam around in the smoke-filled chamber . There was another mild splash beside him , and Jerry surfaced , spear gun at the ready . " Peaceful in here . " " But not silent . Hear that ? " Cadmann was about to ask , What ? , then heard the distant gurgle . The other twelve were up now . Their lamp beams pinked the darkness and smoke , running pale disks across bare cave walls . " Let 's go with the current for a while . " Their flippers barely moved as they let the current carry them toward the exit . Half the team watched underwater . The others stayed at the surface , with only their heads and lamps above the oily water . They swam in a V formation , each close enough to see two others . Sometimes the swirling smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fangs . The current grew stronger . Cadmann surfaced . " Louder , I think . " " Rog , " Andy answered . " Stay together and head toward the shore ! " Cadmann 's arms and legs lashed powerfully at the water . Most of the others were right behind him . They were holding steady . He heard their regular breathing in his earphones . Then a sudden anguished cry , and he saw someone disappear over the lip of a falls . Moments later Cadmann heard the splash . " Who was that ? " A short pause , and then , " Kokubun , here . Wow ! What a ride ! Safe  --  only about a dozen meters . But it 's lonely in here . " " Could you climb out , Mits ? " " No sweat . Come on down . " Cadmann considered for a moment . " All right . By twos . " His men swam toward the lip of the waterfall . A pair of snaggled , broken rocks divided the water flow , like the grinning mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torches . The first two men tumbled down . There was silence for a moment , then laughter . " Piece of cake , " one shouted . Cadmann played his light behind him through the outer chamber . No disturbance , no movement . The yellowish smoke still swirled , but it was noticeably lighter even in the few minutes he had been there . " Go by twos . " Finally only Cadmann and Carlos were left , and together they swam for the lip . The pull of the current was strong , but not impossible to fight near the shoreline . When Cadmann let himselfgo there was a momentary sensation of weightlessness , then a ramp of water-polished stone to reach up from beneath them , and he slid the rest of the way into the water . It took all of his discipline to restrain a whoop . " Well . " He shook his head , grinning under his mask . " That was refreshing . What have we here ? " The smoke was even deeper , and it looked sulphurous . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their lamp beams ate through the smoke to the blackened ceiling . Patches of steaming scum still floated on the water . It looked like something out of the Inferno . " If it was in here , " Andy said positively , " it 's dead now . " " I 'll go with that . " A grainy column of light stabbed out . The chamber was smaller than Cadmann had thought , and it was empty . His flash showed three jaggedly framed black exits . " Now what , Coach ? " Jerry asked . " It was your soup . What do you think ? " " I think there was more than enough . " " Yeah . We do n't have any real choices , do we ? Divide into three teams and look into each of those exits . How is everyone fixed ? Anyoneneed to change yet ? " There was a quick chorus of negatives , and Cadmann checked his own supply . Still almost a third left on his first cartridge . Good enough . Jerry headed one team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something about that middle tunnel ... . " If the tunnels split again , that 's it . Wait at the junction and signal . Under no circumstances divide the team , do you understand ? When you 're ten minutes into the second cartridge , turn around and start making your way back . If the radios start giving out , turn aroundp207and head back to this chamber . We do n't want any heroes . If you spot the corpse , call for the rest of us . All right . Be safe . " JERRY and Andy swam with slow , even strokes . The engineer was rather clumsy on the land , but in the water his extra girth was less of a liability . A trail of tiny silvery bubbles escaping from Andy 's rebreatherreflected in Jerry 's lamp beam . Behind them , the other members of their team kept pace . Something brushed Jerry , and he nervously followed it with the light . It was almost a meter long , and looked more like a snake than a fish . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy said . " Water breather , " Jerry answered . " It 's probably blind . Even in the deepest caves on Earth , you can find blind salamanders and in-sects . " When this is over , I 'm coming back with a net and a sample case , he promised himself . " Think it 's dead ? " " Sure . We still have to know . " " Gotcha . I 'm checking topside . " Andy headed up toward the surface , and by Jerry 's light it was as if the man disappeared above the shoulders . " We 're through into anotherchamber . The air looks clear . " " Do n't take off your mask . Not all of the fumes are going to be visible . " " No problem . " Jerry surfaced next to him , shone his light around in the cave . This chamber was a little larger than the last , but still not more than thirty meters long . He directed his light straight up , and Andy whistled . Directly above , the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will you look at this pothole ? " " What 's that ? " " A dry chimney , in spelunking terms . Vertical channels formed by water flow . Water dried up , so we do n't call it a chimney anymore . Look over there . " To the left were a series of rounded steps , as flat as fish scales , each a half-dozen meters across , like a badly skewed stack of silver dollars or a stage for a Vegas musical . " Called ' gours . ' Formed as carbonate is precipitated from turbulentwater . Miskatonic must have been higher ... more likely , it getsp208higher later in the year . Come on . " Andy waved his light towards a widely arched opening . " I want to take a look back in the shadows . It might have crawled up there to die . " " Or get well . " " Come on , Jerry . No confidence in your soup ? Hell , that stuff would have killed a dozen monsters . " Jerry followed Andy 's lead . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in . Onyx and sparkling rocks glittered in the light of his flash . It was almost peaceful down here , and Jerry brought himself up short : that kind of thinking could easily get them both killed . Another of the blind fish brushed past him . This one 's eyes were pasty white , staring lifelessly in a broad face . Its mouth was crowded with needlelike teeth , and it nosed in for an experimental nip . He knocked it away with the tip of his speargun . " Looks like a dead end , " Andy said . " I 'll check out the far side . " He kicked his bulky frame through the murk with surprising grace . Andy went up , and up . He said , " Hey  --  " And then his entire body just levitated from the water , whipped out as if vacuumed up with a suction pump . What ? Had he climbed out ? Or pulled himself out ? " Andy ? " Andy 's body smashed down into the water almost atop Jerry . Just his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the raggedly torn stump on his neck . They fogged the light . Hordes of blind fish streaked into the cloud , tussling and snapping at each other . Jerry 's chest froze , and he backpedaled frantically . There would come a lethal moment of water pressure , the single instant of warning before horror swooped out of the cloud of blood . In that instant he might have to trigger the spear gun into its grinning , gaping mouth ... . Then he was through , into the other chamber . He scrambled backward up over the gours , the grooved stone surface scraping at his hands and legs . His voice was a squeak into the throat mike . " Danger . Mayday ! This is Jerry . I . . . we found it . Andy is dead . Repeat , Andy is dead . Converge on left tunnel at once . Repeat . We have located animal . It is alive and deadly . " Arnie Donovan and Jill Ralston joined him at the water 's edge . Together the three of them backed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had seen those things kill before , but this . . . what in the world ? Why had it killed Andy ? And then thrown the body back almost disdainfully ? Whatever a man might hunt on Earth , there were other men to tell him how to do it . Thinking like the prey is an old game , hundreds of thousands of years old . The first shamans who propitiated the spirits of antelopes might have got it wrong , hundreds of thousands of years back , but the need was there . You can not hunt what you can not understand . With this creature there was nobody to ask . Carlos popped up in the water , and in a few moments Kokubun and two others joined them . Then Cadmann appeared , striding huge and implacable from the dark of the river , spear gun at the ready . " What happened ? " Jerry slowed his trip-hammer breathing . His teeth chattered . " Andy and I went into th  --  the cave . He surfaced , and that was it . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scream . " " Volunteers , " Cadmann said . Carlos raised his hand immediately , and four of the others . " Fine . The rest of you  --  wait ten secondsand follow us in . Jerry ? " " I 'm right behind you . " Cadmann nodded and slipped into the water . Jerry was the last in . Suddenly the water felt slimy to him . Fear constricted his chest , and he could n't breathe . The water surface was silver above him . Andy had gone up , arms and legs thrashing , and back down without his head . A flash of light ripped the darkness from the water . A moment later the shock wave hit , and the numbing , thunderous roar of sound . Jerry surfaced . " Dear God in heaven ... " The cave was smaller than the one he had just left , with a broad shelf of gours to the left . On it the creature was whirling , spinning like a top with something dark and hideously limp in its mouth . It took Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ripped from its owner 's body like a twig from a sapling . Andy 's leg ; for Andy 's headless corpse had been thrown clear across the cavity and was slidingdown from near the ceiling . The creature froze for an instant . Jerry had just time to make out its squat monitor shape , the spiked tail thrashing restlessly , the gapingp210mouth lined with daggers . Then with a blur it was among them , churning in a circle , frothing the water with blood . Human and reptilian screams mingled . One of the spears explodedagainst the rock wall , one against the ceiling , another in the water with a blinding flash . The monster 's tail whipped twice , then slammed down on a diver 's head , driving it under . There was horrific crunch , and a man flew from the water , smashing into a heap on the shore . Cadmann tore out his mouthpiece and screamed at it , " Over here , you bastard ! Here ! " He whistled as loudly as he could , then put his mouthpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a centrifuge . The creature righted itself and jetted straight for Cadmann , too quickly , too damned quickly . Jerry did n't have time to scream warning , or even blink : the creature had changed paths and was streakingCadmann fired . The spear hit the monster precisely in the throat , and the explosion nearly decapitated it . Blood and bone and bits of flesh foamed from the water and showered on them . The water smoked as the shattered body rolled twice , then sank . For a long moment there was silence . Jerry could n't help shining his flashlight in Cadmann 's face . There was an expression that frightenedhim there . Satisfaction , and vindication , and something else . Something primal , and terribly strong . Then it faded , and Cadmann was himself again . He spoke slowly . " All right . All clear . We need a net in here , and medical care . Who 's got a med kit ? " Mits raised a weary arm . " Good . All right . Let 's get it moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shelf , feet dangling . His breath rasped in the throat mike . Cadmann slipped a re-breather cartridge from his backpack and clicked it into the front unit . He turned to look at Jerry , and his expression was indecipherable . " Are you all right ? " Jerry asked . Why am I nervous ? Cadmann smiled almost paternally . There was an edge to that smile , cold and sharp . " Never better . "  |p211To  stand still on the summit of reflection is difficult , and in the natural course of things , who can not go forward steps back . GAIUS VELLEIUS PATERCULUS ( 20 B.C. to 30 A.D. ) THE CORPSE STRETCHED almost fourteen feet from the tip of a rounded snout to the spiked ankylosaur tail . Its bulk filled two veterinarytables : its sour wet smell hung in the air like a curtain of flies . Its grayish-green hide was rent in a score of places . Ribs poked through in rows of stained ivory , denser and more roughly surfaced than human bone . Its webbed feet were torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull copper in the unwavering overhead light . Sylvia noticed half a dozen gawking colonists still crowded in the door . Triumph . They were n't there . They laughed at Cadmann . Now they gloat . Unfair , and she knew it , but she savored the taste of malice . You have your triumphs . I have mine . She looked to the corner where Cadmann stood erect , not bothering to lean against the wall . Cadmann has both . It was his radio messageGrendel is dead ! Grimy humor that ; grim hut oddly appropriate even so minutely removed from the horror of feat I ) ay . In death the creature ceased top212menace their future , and thus assumed an oddly mythic quality . Grendel is dead . It was funny . Even now , so soon after Bobbi 's death , she knew it was funny . God , she wished she could laugh . Carlos sat slumped in the corner , trying desperately to get drunk enough to cry . " Grendel is dead , " Sylvia said dully . " In the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heorot . " She swept her hand to indicate the quarter ton of quiescent monster flesh . " We mutilate corpses too  --  " Jerry paused in the act of of pulling on surgeon 's gloves . " For answers , I hope . " " Damn right you 'll get answers , " Cadmann muttered . There are so many questions . Life ? Death ? Is the nightmare over ? Or just beginning ? " Please , " Jerry said . " I need room to work . Cadmann , Carlos , Zack  --  I 'd appreciate it if you remained . Everyone else , please . " The doorway cleared and the sheet-metal door closed . But Sylvia knew that their audience had not retreated far : their impatiently shufflingfeet and choppy breathing hovered just beyond the threshold of perception . Jerry inhaled deeply . The light from above shimmered around his stick-figure body like an aura . " Cassandra Program . " The juryriggedcomputer hummed . Gears chugged and ground . Everyone watched . Then slowly , in jerks , the camera moved to position itself above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras , like everything else , had been severely damaged during the initial assault . Everything had been designed for durability , but that was on Earth , in a design laboratory , damage simulated by computer , not inflicted by monsters . Now  --  with Omar Isfahan 's help Jerry was redesigningthe system , restoring lost capabilities . This was the first practical test of Cassandra 's restoration . The computer hesitated anothersecond , and then the gooseneck camera snaked down . Carlos tore open a pouch of vodka , staring unblinkingly at the corpse . He guzzled half the pouch and coughed as it burned its way down . He handed the rest to Cadmann . There were no words . All of Carlos 's struggle had been for nothing . Bobbi had neverp213come out of shock . Her heart had simply given up . Carlos had not cried ; he had simply smashed his fist into the wall , damaging both plaster and knuckles . Without a word , he had gone to the camp liquor supply . No one had tried to refuse him . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard warrior . Both seemed cut from the same dark , dangerous cloth . Jerry moved the scalpel carefully along the creature 's head , slittingand then peeling away the skin , exposing the skull 's smooth , barely convex arch . " I do n't see any fissures at all , " he remarked for the record . He switched to the band drill . It whined , etching its way through the tough layer of tissue . The stench of burning bone tickled Sylvia 's nostrils through her gauze face mask . " Thickheaded tart , " Jerry muttered . " This one is definitely older an uglier than the first . Might even be its mama . " " Grendel and Grendel 's mother , " Sylvia said . " It fits , " She winked at Cadmann . He pretended to ignore her . You 're the one who sent that message , she thought . Jerry lifted a section of skull to expose a pale layer of membrane protecting the brain . Slitting it exposed darkly pinkish jellied pulp . " Cassandra . Watch this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carefully controlledvoice . " This has to be olfactory brain tissue . It 's well defined and coterminouswith nasal passages . Well penetrated with air passages . This critter had one hell of a sense of smell . " Behind and above that is more tissue that has some similarities , but it 's also well defined , and does n't appear to be part of the olfactory area . If there 's any parallel with human evolution , this is the equivalentof cortex , although it sure does n't look much like what we use for cortex . Lots of convolutions , though . Maybe that 's a universal ? " From the size and shape , if I 'm right about what this area is and does , the critter is at least as intelligent as a gorilla . Maybe more so . Better sense of smell than a dog or a cat . " The saw whirred again . " Moving back , there 's a whole series of enlarged ganglia complexes . Subsidiary brains , maybe ? I know there are at least three more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is they really are subsidiary brains that control reflexes and locomotion . That 's onep214reason the critter can move so fast . The central brain gives orders , but they get carried out by a whole batch of brains distributed along the systems . " Computer networks operate that way . Sylvia looked away from the monster and back to Cadmann . He was leaning forward , his teeth just showing . Jerry continued to work . His hands moved deftly , guiding the instruments in precise motions , exposing without damaging . From time to time he called up ultrasound and X-ray images on the computerscreen , consulted them , then went back to his grisly task . An hour passed . Presently Jerry removed some tissue samples . " All right . Sylvia , we 'll want microscopic examinations of this . Freeze and section and  --  " " And the rest . Sure , " she said . She kept her voice pleasant . " Sorry  --  " " ' S all right . " Sylvia moved closer . " That oversized jaw . The first one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic , I 'd say . " " Yes . Jaw . Oversized feet . Webbed , but with claws , designed for fighting , but also for traction . No hands , though . It was never designedas a tool user . " " Right on that . " Carlos took another stiff drink , then slammed the canteen down . He stood , stepping out of the shadow and closer to the table . " Traction ? Want to see traction ? Look at Cadmann 's ribs . Damned scars have n't healed yet . " She could see his eyes now . They were red-rimmed , bright with tears and loathing . " That bitch ran right up the cliff . It did n't climb , it sprinted . It just smashed into the boat , chewed it up like a grape skin . Bobbi never had a goddamned chance . " He was shaking , and seemed to calm only when Cadmann clasped his shoulder from behind . The tension drained out of Carlos and he retreated to the shadows . " I saw that too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gears , fast and superfast . I want some answers . " " You and everyone else , Cadzie . You 've both done your parts . Leave the rest of it to us . " She felt a kick , a sensation of pulling , of her pelvic girdlep215stretching , accompanied by momentary faintness . She caught her balance and shut her mind to the fatigue . " Sylvie ? Are you all right ? " Cadmann asked from the shadows . He sees everything . " Fine . " " No , you 're not  --  " " Good enough . Look , I promise . As soon as we 're finished with the preliminaries , I 'll take a nap . I just ca n't miss being in on this one . " Saw and drills continued to sing and strip away the skin and the flesh from the thing that had haunted their nightmares , while ultrasoundrecorders watched and remembered . The dissection would later be computer-corrected to form an in-depth holographic template . Then the analysis could begin . Zack spoke for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He indicated Cassandra and the other complex instruments in the room . " It could n't have known what it was up against . " Carlos growled deep in his throat and stood . Before  --  he could move he was halted by Sylvia 's laugh . She looked to Cadmann and grinned . " No . It could n't . " Carlos sat on his stool as the saw began a new song . They peeled away the ribs . At first Sylvia concentrated on the lungs : flatter than human lungs , less a pair of bags than a webwork with blood vessels running through them . Arteries and veins were thumb-thick , oversized , capable of pumping blood and oxygen to working muscles at a fantastic rate . She could only shake her head in wonder . She probed into the gland sacks , flattened organs perching atop the lungs . " What in the world ? " she whispered . " Cassandra . Close up . " She sliced into them with the tip of her scalpel . The walls were elastic and wrinkled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whateverthis is , it can hold a lot more than it does right now . " A brilliant carmine fluid jellied in the sacks , and she spooned out a sample . " I 'm going to run an analysis on this . " Sylvia placed the sample in the spare biothermograph ferried down from Geographic . There was a faint humming sound as it pumped the air from the sample chamber . Thank God that this apparatus , at least , had been duplicated . So much equipment had been lost ; they would have a hell of a time working out this creature 's gene patterns now . Its flesh might have top216be preserved for years before such apparatus could be replaced . When the BTG had finished evacuating , the dollop of red fluid was burned in a flash , and a quick band of color flashed across the viewer . Sylvia whistled softly . " Eh ? " Jerry prompted . He looked to the screen where the computeranalysis of the chromatography would appear . Sylvia 's voice was pensive . " How can this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oxygen bonded with carbon , iron , magnesium , but mostly oxygen . I would n't have believed it . What 's the structure of those sacks ? " " Honeycomb . They were filled with the fluid . " He probed with the scalpel , frowned and cut again . " Hah . Muscle bands . Herehere  --  yep . Set up to constrict the sacs , which would inject this stuff into the blood streams . The duct leads directly into the heart chambers  --  " " Super oxygenated blood supplement , " Sylvia said . " Which means " Right ! " Jerry shouted . " That 's it ! Supercharger ! Good lord , no wonder this thing is so damned dangerous . " " What ? " Zack demanded . " What have you found ? " Jerry almost danced with excitement . " This is it , I 'm sure of it . " " How can you be so damned happy about how powerful this thing is ? " Carlos demanded . " Do n't you see ? " Sylvia shouted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " The monster depends on superoxygenation . That means it 's vulnerable . We can kill it . " " Maybe I 'm stupid , " Zack said . " But I do n't see  --  " Jerry ignored him . " Cadmann . Was there , say , anything unusual about the amount of body heat from this thing ? You 've been closer than anyone . " Cadmann paused for a moment , then spoke . " Yes , dammit , there was . When the first one killed Ernst at the blind . It was stalking the calf , and everything was fine . But as soon as we took a shot at it , the temperature went through the roof . " " Enough to cause a flare in your infrared , as I recall . " " Right . " Jerry took a step back from the graying thing on the tables , the dead , cold hulk leaking blood and cloudy fluid drop by slow drop onto the stained tile floor . " And amphibian . We 'll never find thesep217things far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen . There ca n't be many of these things on the island  --  " Carlos cursed vilely and smashed his pouch to the ground . " I swear to God . The next idiot who says that , I am going to break his face . Shit . " He kicked at the plastic skin , squirting liquid out into a puddle . Cursing again , he scooped it off the floor and stormed out of the room . " Before , it was a guess , " Jerry said . He did n't sound worried . " Now we know . " " Know what ? " " There ca n't be many of them . By many I mean more than a dozen or so . Cadmann , there 's not enough for them to eat ! Look at the teeth . A couple of grinders . They can crunch of seeds and grass and bark in a pinch , but they 're sure as hell not evolved for eating plants . They want meat , and lots of it , and there just is n't enough meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia said . " That 's why they were so scared of the water ! These things hide in the water . The poor pterodons ! They have to fish , but they never know , when they dive for a samlon , but what one of these will be waiting for them  --  " " Right . " Jerry stepped back from the table and dropped his mask . " Look , we can wait for the computer analysis , but we do n't really need it , do we ? We had a brood of them . Heck , this one might well have been the mother . Picture her swimming over , or floating over on a piece of driftwood , or any other scenario you like . She 's already pregnant , with a clutch of eggs ready to be laid . Land her ten or twenty years ago , perhaps , and they proceed to strip the island of animal protein . " " Everything except sarnlon , " Sylvia said . " Yeah . " Jerry looked thoughtful . " And there is our next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What protects samlon ? Maybe our monster only hunts on the land . And by the way  --  we need a name for this thing . We ca n't just keep calling it monster . " Sylvia forced a smile . " I think Cadmann already named it . Grendel . ' " " Name it be damned , " Cadmann said . " You said it was vulnerable . How vulnerable ? " " In a minute , " Jerry said . " Damn . It really is a puzzle . These things eat everything . Have eaten everything , they damned near stripped this island clean  --  Sylvia ! It alI fits ! Dopey Joes in the hills ,  |p218none  near water . Pterodons , nothing else . Everything but the samlon . All right , what keeps the grendels from eating all the samlon ? " " Poisonous ? " Sylvia asked . " Or  --  oh , damn . " " What ? " " Something  --  I have the feeling I 'm forgetting something . " " Ca n't be important . " " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Does n't seem reasonable . They ate cattle . We eat samlon . " " Yeah  --  " " Or , " Jerry said , " maybe Grendel only hunts warm-blooded creatures . " " Given its choice , sure , " Cadmann said . " That bitch would eat her own children if she were hungry enough . Believe it . " " I do n't know what to believe now . That 's what we 're  --  " Jerry 's voice faded out , and Sylvia groped for support as the room seemed to ripple and she lost her footing . Cadmann was under her in an instant , and the last thing that she felt before darkness overwhelmedher was the comforting strength of his arms , and his whisperedwords : " I 'm here . " SYLVIA 'S eyes were open , but totally unfocused . Light and shadow mingled indeterminably . As her senses returned she heard the slow rumble of Terry 's breathing , and finally realized that she was in her own bedroom . Somewhere outside her window men were arguing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horribly drunk. "  --  the hell , marica ? You think you could have done better ? " "  --  do n't have to think . You killed her , you left her and ran , you dickless wonder  --  " She heard the sharp , sudden sound of bone meeting bone , and the side of her cabin shuddered as a body slammed into it . Briefly the shadow of two struggling bodies fell across the window . She watched the dark , shifting shapes , overcome with an hallucinogenicsense of unreality . Another sharp crack . Gasps , a creak of tortured metal , the stifled sobs of pain and anger . A swift curse in Spanish , and a softer thud . Then Cadmann 's voice : " Break it up . All right . You 've both had enough . We have a bigger fight than this  --  " There were a few more muttered words , then the voices faded . The shadows dissolved before the sweep of the searchlight , meldedp219into the darkness , and once again the night was still . Sylvia rolled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar above his head and pulled himself upright . " You 're awake . " " Only when I heard the racket . " Her head buzzed hollowly . Somebody tranked me ... . " Damn . Listen  --  you have n't had a full night 's sleep for three clays , and I want you to get one . You 've been running on adrenaline . " His hand slipped from her chest to her belly , the warm , gentle swell there , and she suddenly realized the truth in his words . Both of her needed rest . And food . Now that the adrenaline rush had slowed , she could hear the dull roar of hunger and fatigue . The tension had masked it . The tension of waiting , of helplessly watching the search for Carlos and Bobbi . Of watching Cadmann and the others descend into the earth to do battle with the unknown . Of standing at Marnie 's shoulder , waging a losing battle for Bobbi 's life . Of waiting to convey the terrible news to Carlos . . . if Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . But now .. . Terry was right . " Carlos and Stu just needed to get it out . They 'll probably cover each other 's backs tomorrow . There 's nothing anyone can do for it . " He ran his hands lovingly through her hair , scratching her scalp with the tips of his nails . " And anyway , I 'm here to make sure that you do n't go running off . Junior needs you to be reasonable . " For an instant she thought of arguing , then fatigue completed what tranquilizers and low blood sugar began , and she slipped back into a light and fitful sleep . WHEN Sylvia finally emerged from the caverns of narcosis some ten hours later , the camp was on full alert . The mine fields beyond the perimeter fence were activated . Current pulsed through the wire . Sylvia 's skin hummed if she approached it too closely . She wrapped her sweater around her more tightly and headed through the thin morning fog toward the communal dining hall . In the midst of total alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitted against human enemies . It 's only an animal . Intelligentas a gorilla . Maybe as intelligent as a primitive human . Does n't matter . It ca n't use tools ! It 's only an animal . We  --  Cadmann hunted it down , went into its den , and it was n't a dragon at all . Only an animal , with a brain smaller than a man 's , and no tools.  |p220A  tiger in the dark room is a monster . Turn on the light , and it is just an animal . Cadmann turned on the lights for us . Zack held the door for her as she entered the dining hall . She asked him , " How 's Carlos ? " " Sleeping it off . Stu has a busted lip . Well earned , if you ask me . Virtually every adult male , and half the women , were clustered in the hall . The walls and ceiling of the hall were illuminated with views of the Colony and points south . Cadmann stood in the front of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kill team . He stands there  --  does he know just how arrogantly he 's standing there ? But the rest of them , they 're taking it seriously . They accept it . I never saw him like this before . In his element . The bad time is over for Colonel Cadmann Weyland . One of the wall videos wavered , and Cadmann 's face loomed into focus . " We 'll be using a portable holo system , " he continued . " Rachel will carry it into the first assault  --  and I want her to stay back . The idea here is to perfect a system . If we make any mistakes , we want the camp to know it fast . If we do it right , we can be sure that the National Geographic people will be interested . This will head back to Earth along with the rest of the data on grendels . George , Jill , you 'll bracket the pool here , and here  --  " Sylvia looked at the maps . One was a digitalized thermal breakdownrepresenting fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall was a contour map , and on a third a wildlife vector . Greatest concentrations of samlon had been detailed . Four of the water holes had been identified as likely hidey-holes . These had large populations of samlon , and no hot springs nearby . Grendels would want cold water to dump heat into . Distance from the other holes was an important factor . Any creature as voracious as a grendel had to be extremely territorial , requiring substantial hunting ground . Sylvia found her eyes drawn time and again to the center maps . The Colony . A small area , really . Terribly small when examined in contrast to the entire island . Barely two square kilometers . The view from the Geographic made hollow their assertions of mastery . From that perspective , how very little change they had wrought . So presumptuous had been the children of Earth . When all was said and done , might not this new world , this terribly old world ,  |p221swallow  them and their folly , leaving nothing behind but bones ? Bones , and some films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send others this way again . Earth was rich , and jaded . She touched her belly , trying to sense the slumbering life within . It shifted , kicking , and suddenly she felt awesomely small and vulnerable . What was she doing here ? What were any of them doing here ? All she could think of was the image of that hideous beast twisting through the searchlights , sprinting forward like a windup toy with a broken spring . Bathed in flame , skin coated in jellied gasoline . By all sanity dead , but living still . God in heaven . Then there were the Knights of Avalon , men and women descendinginto the caves beneath the northern ravine . There , in the abysmal darkness , confronting a larger , more powerful version of the first beast . Armed with better weapons , more certain knowledge , and something else : the kind of foolhardy courage that had lured men beyond the edge of shadow since time immemorial . Now forty grim determined men and women waited , armed and ready . Waited to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to stand between Sylvia 's unborn child and the hideous grasp of a grendel . Suddenly her eyes blurred with tears , and an unbidden , heartfelt prayer echoed in her mind . God be with you , Cadmann . Because the Devil has already dealt himself in.  |p222Chance  favors the trained mind . LOUIS PASTEURCARLOS WIPED his forehead with the back of a gritty hand and adjustedhis throat mike . " Martinez here . In place . " The water hole was situated eighty miles north of the Colony , an hour 's flight by Skeeter . Just a wet spot hidden by bushes , forty feet long by half that wide , one he would never have believed could be sixty feet deep . Some ancient seismic activity had torn the rocks apart and the Miskatonic had filled the hole . That was long ago . A monster lurked there now . Probably , Carlos reminded himself ; but in his heart he knew . You 're there , and I have come to kill you . The clearing was roughly horseshoe-shaped , narrowing into an eastern bottleneck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The overflow bubbled up over a western rise of crumbled stone and disappeared into a marsh . Probability 78 percent . Those words had sounded encouraging back at the camp , but here at the killing ground , with twenty huntersp223surrounding the hole , that 22 percent uncertainty looked as big as Mucking Great Mountain . In just a few minutes they would know . Carlos stared at the chill depths . Grendel , Grendel , are you there ? Grendel , we have come to kill you , he thought ; but all that Carlos had seen so far were samlon flashing like silver shadows . Be here . Be here and die . Die slowly , die and taste death  --  " You okay , amigo ? " Hendrick Sills asked . Carlos flashed a quick smile at his companion . " Si , compadre . " He let Bobbi 's image fade , forgot the still , pale face and the memory of a last desperate kiss shared beneath a shelf of rock . No mistakes this time . Twenty men and women surrounded this hole . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than enough to take down one of these bizcuernos . The satchel team stood by . Three men : on signal they would run forward to throw eight kilograms of explosives into the hole , then run away as the charge sank until either the depth fuse or the timer detonatedit . The hydrostatic shock would either kill or drive it out of the hole . Hendrick Sills , their chief engineer , had verified that there was no other exit . And then ? Well , Cadmann had worked that out well , using terms like " field of fire , " " optimal egress " and " killing ground . " Carlos had never heard the terms , but they resonated , sounded totally right , calmed him more than any prayer . Cadmann knows these things . " Can you believe this ? " Hendrick demanded . " Ten lightyears from home . When my grandparents took the solar system we did n't have anything like this to fight . Just physics , just our own ignorance . Another goddam star and we 're standing here like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strong , these grendels , " Carlos agreed . " But  --  " Hendrick grinned like a wolf . " But . Damn straight , but . ' No brains . " Carlos felt unreasonable resentment . " They have brains . They  --  " " Hey , " Hendrick said . " It 's okay , I 'm on your side , remember ? " Carlos grinned " I remember . My apologies . More , you are correct . The grendels must use instincts . What they know is in their genes . Not so with humans . Once we had conquered all the animals on Earth we began on each other . We have ten thousand years of war experience . "  | " And well enough , " Hendrick said . " And well enough . The objective is to kill them . And that we will do . " His comcard spoke . " Carlos , this is Cadmann . You ready ? " " As I 'll ever be , amigo . " " Let 's do it , then . All units , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed men and women looked to their weapons , then waited . " Alpha team , go ! " Three men ran forward , one of them George Merriot , still limpingfrom his burn wounds . Ten feet from the sinkhole they paused . One stood with flame thrower ready as the other two swung the heavy satchel they held between them . " One , two , three , go ! " The dark brown box arced out toward the swampy hole . " That 's it ! " the team leader called . " Run away ! " They were laughing as they rejoined their comrades in the line facing the hole . The bomb splashed into the dark water and vanished . One . Two . . . Carlos counted half consciously ... ten , eleven .. . WHAM ! It came as a surprise , as it always did , no matter how hard Carlos tried to be ready for it . Water shot skyward , water and samlon and tiny crustaceans and mud . Now wait .. . For about four seconds . The water exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle burst from the surface of the water . The grendel came at an impossible speed over the lip of the sinkhole . It dashed over the floppingsamlon that lay at the water 's edge . Once it had a firm footing it paused , black bullet body glistening in the afternoon light . Its enormoussaucer eyes glared at themThen fixed on Carlos . Directly upon him , and he froze in fear and impotent horror . We ca n't do it . We ca n't kill this thing .. . " Shoot ! " Cadmann ordered . Someone fired automatically . Then someone else . Carlos screamed wordlessly . He forced himself to center the grendel in the sights of his weapon . It was out of the hole , out and charging , moving at speeds that no animal could possibly reach , moving so fast that although time had slowed for Carlos , the creature had become faster , so fast thatp225everything happened at once  --  and he squeezed the trigger . Carlos 's bolt exploded in the bushes behind the creature . Three other hits . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come forward but tripped over its own severed foreleg . Even then it did not die . It pulled itself up onto the rocks and took off like a good racing car , away from the pain , away from the foaming , smoking water and lancing spears , running east through the shallow stream , toward the safety of the MiskatonicAs Cadmann had said it would . " Down ! " Cadmann 's voice was calm and reassuring in the earphones , and Carlos was down . One second later there was an awesomeroar , and after that he was showered by dirt and falling rock . ' I'wo big mud drops struck his cheek . " All clear . " Cadmann sounded cheerful . " Chalk up one more . " One more . " Like I said , no brains , " Hendrick said . " They 'll always go for the river . Plant some mines and wait  --  " " Would you have thought of that ? " " Aw , I do n't know . " " Nor would I , " Carlos said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You or I , perhaps we would have thought of the mines , and perhaps we ' night have thought of whatever it is that we will need when those no longer work . Would you be willing to bet that either of us will think of that before Cadmann does ? Or know that it is right ? " Hendrick stood and shook off the dirt from his coveralls . " Lighten up . Let 's go see what we got . " " Yes . " Carlos stood . " Let us look at our grendel . " His forefinger picked a speck of wet red flesh from his cheek . Not a raindrop . There was n't much . Craters in the dirt , splashes of bright crimson , torn alien flesh and bone , a flailing severed tail , ropy red strands splashed against the rocks . Carlos felt a grin pulling his face toward his ears . Twenty hunters stood up from their positions around the clearing . All twenty of them . They had n't lost a single man , and the grendel was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , " Cadmann ordered . " All units , stand by . Alpha team , move out . " Once again three men moved forward . One stood with flamep226thrower ready as the others tossed the satchel charge into the pothole . WHAM ! Mud , water and samlon showered the area . Carlos stood tenselyAnd nothing happened . " All clear , " Cadmann said at last . He left his command post and came over to Carlos . " And that 's what I call ballin ' the jack . " " Damn straight , amigo . " Carlos raised his weapon . " Damn straight ! " The victory cry built deep inside him , rolling slowly up through his chest and out of his throat like the cry of a more primitive , more basic animal . The others joined in . Twenty hunters , screaming to the cloud-muddied sky , the glory and perfection of the moment connecting them with a simpler time . They were alive , and the enemy was dead , its limbs and guts spread before them . Still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the shamans , the ancient men and women of the village , should scramble out from behind the rocks , should examine lengths of twisted gut , stare into the scarred and lifelesseyes of a foe and speak of the signs within . Eat handfuls of jellied brain and sing of dark portents and bloody dreams . Then again , he realized that he did n't need diviners to tell him the future . Here , on Avalon , mankind was the future . The howls from twenty throats rose to the sky .. . JERRY sighed in disappointment as he examined the gutted corpse . There was samlon meat in its belly . Jerry identified parts of three samlon , two nearly dissolved , one nearly fresh . " Now we know . Nothing protects samlon , " Jerry said . " No great secrets here at all . " " So why are they still around ? " Sylvia wondered . " They probably breed faster than hell , and there are n't enough grendels to wipe them out . That 's good news . I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attention ; above the creature 's staring eyes . He moved his tweezers under something , and lifted . Half a meter of limp tubing rose from a cleft in the forehead . " I 'll be damned . Will you look at that ? It 's got a snorkel for breathing underwater . Here , you can see where the blood vessels fill to lift it . Just like a penis . Sorry . "  |p227Sylvia  said , " We 're out to kill them . You 're starting to admire them . " " Know your enemy . " ONCE the technique was devised , the killings themselves became almostroutine . The adrenaline was there , the sense of satisfaction , but experience had dampened the true danger , replacing it with caution and structure . Because , after all was said and done , the grendels were mortal . Heirs to the same failings as any other creature of protoplasm . Vulnerableto the same techniques of killing that had worked on Earth , evolved through countless big-game hunts and wars since the beginning of recorded time . Flush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killing ground . The second killing team utilized an additional refinement . There was a chance , no matter how small , that a grendel might be hiding outside the water hole , or might find an auxiliary exit and attack them from the rear . Transverse observers were posted , one for every two hunters facing the killing ground . Two hovering Skeeters watched from above , scanning for grendels . There were only twelve sites on the entire island with a probabilityabove 30 percent . Twelve holes . One a day , with the Colony kept under full battle alarm the entire time . They would not lose another human being . IT WAS good to have a system : Skeeter above , and a first pinning team moved into place while the engineering corps designed the mine field , worked with Cadmann to determine the field of fire that would best funnel the creature to its death . Where natural walls of rock were insufficient , walls of flame were utilized , flame throwers backed by men and women with rifles and spear guns . And always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain-maddened creature could run to safety , to freedom . . . To certain death . So died the fourth grendel , blown in half and then roasted by jellied flange , dead even as it crawled for the depths of the Miska/tonic , pitifully torn claws outstretched , eyes open and fixed . Yearning , perhaps , for one last taste of the samlon flashing within . And the fifth , dead before it ever reached the mine field , Carlos 's explosive spear in its brain . He took limited pride : he had been aimingat the heart . And always , always , there was Cadmann , driving them on and on , past exhaustion with his boundlessly murderous energy . The spirit was infectious , and when they trudged back to their temporary camp at the end of the fourth day , no one wanted to be skeetered back to main base . The temporary camp was a fifty-meter stretch of cleared brush , burned out and then chopped and plowed . Supplies were flown in from the Colony . The entire perimeter of the camp was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning with infrared . At first Carlos disliked the endless hum of the Skeeters overhead . Now , the cessation of the sound , or the occasional sound of two overhead rotors as Skeeters changed shifts , would awaken him instantly , sending a hand reaching out for the spear gun . He was tired but happy . The muscles in his calves had seized up , and the tendons ached . He massaged them for a half hour before they stopped screaming . Cadmann 's tent was near the southern periphery of camp , and Carlos rapped on the foil , saying , " Knock knock . " Cadmann laughed . " Come on in . " The big man was sitting cross-legged on the ground . A light was suspended from the tent pole , shining onto a map . " What do we have here , corn padre ? " " Well , a peek at tomorrow 's kill . We 've identified the monster here  --  smaller than the others . It 's the southernmost beast . " Dumping blood , sheep intestines and chunks of monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , but here we have one . " He grinned , and turned to Carlos , teeth gleaming . " Do you know what that means ? " " It means that we 're almost finished . " " By God , yes ! " Cadmann slammed his fist down . " Cigar ? " Carlos shook his head at first , and then nodded . " I did n't even know you smoked . " " Only on verra special occasions , my man . " He conjured two thin cheroots from a plastic pouch and clipped the tip off both . They lit and inhaled smoothly , enjoying the thick , sweet aroma . " About sixp229months ago , I can remember being upset that we had n't brought along a kodiak bear or a mountain lion . " " Well , your wish sure came true . " " Yeah  --  in spades . No offense , heh heh . . . " Cadmann leaned back against his bedroll and exhaled a long , fragrant stream . " No . I wondered if I was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know what I see ? " " What ? " " Survivors . We came , most of us , because life was too easy on Earth , but it was still a guided vacation . There were the colonists , and the crew . And me , Great White Hunter , professional killer . My God , most of them felt safe . That attitude would have been passed on to the children , and their children . And if something like this had happened in two generations instead of right now , our grandchildren might not have been able to handle it at all . So we 've lost a few people , and they were n't dead weight , do n't get me wrong  --  but the ones who are left are true pioneers , not tourists . Fighting for their wives and husbands and children , and their future . " Carlos nodded soberly . " I can see what you mean . " " I figured you would . And I could n't sit here and tell you that I 'm sorry it happened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody dies . The obstetrician slaps you on the ass with one hand and hands you a postdated death certificate with the other . What 's important is that our children have a better chance . It 's always been about the children . Always . Women have never loved being kept from education and treated as second-class citizens . Men have never enjoyed having their balls shot off in wars . Men and women did n't fall into their roles accidentally , and each side does n't hate the other . It happened because for a thousand generations , that was the best way we knew to build a civilization , to build a better future for our children . The industrial revolution doomed slavery  --  racial , sexual , social . Civilization is worth fighting for . " Cadmann seemed more at peace than Carlos had ever seen him . And why not ? Vindicated , loved , appreciated . Involved in the work he was born for . Regardless of what happened from this point forward , the work that Cadmann had done would earn him respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Colony 's only real warrior , but with luck , he could teach the rest of them to be soldiers.  | " Here . " Cadmann opened a flask and handed it to Carlos . It was strong , unwatered whiskey . Carlos sputtered , but did n't lose a drop . " You 'd better not . Probably the most valuable thing in the known universe . Two-hundred-year-old Scotch . " " Salud . " Carlos felt the sweet liquid fire flowing down his throat . " Jesus , that 's good . " " Unfortunately , that 's all there is . " " Yeah . Things could be a lot better . " Sadness clouded his face as he drew deeply on his cigar , but he relaxed as he exhaled a misty wreath around the lamp . " But do you know something ? " " What ? " " Com  --  adre , they have been a hell of a lot worse . "  |p231The  difference between a good man and a bad one is the choice of cause . WILLIAM ! AMESNUMBER SIX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baited , all the other underground rivers mapped . If there was another grendel left on Avalon , it had no interest in blood , no fear of hydrostatic shock . It never turned on its supercharger at night , when Geographic 's thermal scan dissected every square meter of the island . No , this one was the last , and here in the highlands , the farthest south on the island that any human had been , Cadmann felt a minutesense of loss . He listened to the live tone in his ear from the radio link , and to his own breathing . He plucked a sprig of avalonia grass , chewed on it absently and spit out the faintly sweet fibers . He was propped on his elbows at the edge of a bluff overlooking a marshy stream , just upriver from one of the largest hot springs . The thermal gradient had thrown the scans off for a little while , giving this last monster a temporary reprieve . Skeeter Two had hired it out with grendel blood and fresh meat.  |p232The  monster had come sniffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatched the joint of raw beef . It looked and acted starved : much thinner than the others , and only two thirds the length . The Skeeter 's tape had been played back at the Colony . Cadmannvividly remembered the image of a gaunt , hollow-chested reptiletearing at the meat as if it had n't eaten in a week . Jerry had taken the podium and fought for the creature 's life . " We do n't know we can find more of them on the mainland . Think about it  --  an animal which can produce a high-grade organic oxidizer . Imagine a herd of them . Hobble the legs or even amputate them . Breed them to get that oxygen-bonding stuff , that superhemoglobin , like cows give milk ! " Grendels , serving man ? It might be . They would try it . . . once . But Cadmann wondered to himself , wondered about the sadness that he felt . What if this was the last grendel in the universe ? After all , there were earthly species restricted to just one subcontinent or group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big things , as large as anything that ever walked the Earth ; creatures reminiscent of Tyrannosaurusrex , things that man would hunt only with robots and advancedweapons . They glowed in infrared . Easy to guess , now , that there were small , fast things too . Grendels or worse , blazing in infrared , then subsiding before a telescope could find the sources ; mistaken for giants until now . Cadmann tried to imagine Jerry 's pet scenario : a single freshwater grendel , pregnant , clinging to a piece of driftwood after some natural disaster swept her out to sea , a clutch of eggs protected within her body or in an external case , to be deposited in safe territory . These had to be freshwater creatures , did n't they ? Nothing that could effectively compete with the grendels had been found in the oceans , and the oceans held plenty of food . The eggs , hatched downstream , would produce a brood of insanely competitive monsters who fought each other for the prime hunting grounds , driving their weaker siblings farther and farther south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if it had happened once , it could happen again . The mainland was worth a look . Jerry was working on a possibility . Maybe a grendel could be triggered into releasing its superhemoglobin , by sonics or by the smell of an attacker . It would he forced to cook itself before it reached any vulnerable target.  |p233When  Jerry had something to test , then they would seek grendels on the mainland . Only for testing . The mainland belonged to anothergeneration . Today Avalon belonged to humankind . A pregnant grendel on a piece of driftwood . A tricky , temporary current . What 's wrong with this picture ? Why was there a piece of the puzzle that seemed so distant , so lost ? Hibernation Instability ? Damn , there it was  --  the possibility that he had kept from himself for so long . Certainly , anybody could suffer from Hibernation Instability . Anyone but Cadmann Weyland . And he could discount the mood swings , the inability to adapt to a changing social situation when adaptation meant survival , the need to move himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such symptoms could hardly be construed as symptoms of H.I . ! And he 'd been scanned ... but that could only diagnose gross structural damage . There were subtler problems , some of which only a battery of psychological tests would reveal . He had taken no such tests . Cadmann did n't need them  --  no . He brought his attention back to the bend in the river . As in the case of the second monster , the hole was difficult to see . It might have been no more than a fold in the shadow , but it was more . A quarter ton of death lurked there . The last monster . . . They would try to bring it back alive . And if a human being was put in the slightest danger , that would be that . They would return home with a leaking corpse . No woman would mourn her man , no child cry for its mother . " Stage one , " Cadmann whispered into his microphone . Skeeters Two and Four rose up from behind the ridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water where its weighted edges settled quickly to the bottom . The two autogyros braced the hole , humming there like dragonflies hovering over a pond in summer . He smiled grimly at the lazy image . That image was about to explode . Grendel-blood sacks were punctured and tossed into the water upstream from the hole . As the dark stain began to spread , Cadmann started a slow count . " One ... two . . . three . . . fo  --  " The water erupted . A clawed , toothed demon exploded from the depths . Both Skeeters juddered violently as it struck the nets , twisting and yowling.  |p234Stu  's radio voice screamed triumphantly from Skeeter Two : " We 've got it ! " Engines whined with exertion . The Skeeters hoisted the creature free of the water . Cadmann watched carefully , ready to bark a command : if the grendel 's struggle threatened the Skeeters , it would be released , dropped netted onto the land , and charred with flame throwers . The Skeeters bobbed and twisted like paper airplanes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regained controlof his craft , and the Grendel was secured . The two autogyros maneuvered the creature over the far bank and set it down . The net was a Tasmanian Devil of crazed motion , the creature 's legs and head so entangled that it looked as if it was trying to break its own limbs . It would n't break the net . Of this they were certain . But it did n't know that , it could n't know that , and when the Skeeters touched the net down , it burst into furious action and the grendel 's roar of anger and . . . fear ? ( Was that what it felt ? Could it feel fear ? He had never thought of them in those terms . Grendels were living death , and that was all . But something in its screams , its frantic , helpless contortions , flashed the sudden , dreadful image of a tortured child into Cadmann 's mind . He squeezed his eyelids tight to make it disappear . ) Stakes had already been pounded into the ground to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each stake . From his position on the bluff , Cadmann saw his crew run up and connect each line into the net to stabilize it . Now the Skeeters were disconnected , and Stu flew back across the river , hovered over Cadmannand extended his hoist cable . Cadmann wrapped the cable around his arm and hooked the bottom clip to his belt buckle . " You 've got me . All right , Stu . Up . " He had barely repositioned his rifle on his shoulder when Stu swooped up , yanking him into the air . As he swung across the stream , the ring of colonists moved in to surround their captured grendel . Jerry rushed in with a tranquilizer pistol . His hand jerked up as he fired . The creature twitched as the dart hit , then exploded back into movement . Stu touched Cadmann down , and he unhooked himself . The grendel was in continuous motion , growing more frantic by the moment.  | " What do you think ? " Cadmann yelled . Jerry 's limp yellow hair whipped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is pump it full of tranquilizer . We sure ca n't move it like this . " As if in response to Cadmann 's question , the grendel lunged toward them . One of the stakes groaned and popped free from the ground . Faster than conscious thought , Cadmann unshouldered his rifle and thumbed off the safety . But the other stakes held . The beast hissed and thrashed crazily , but could n't come any closer . It began to convulse , its movements without direction or aim . Jerry 's eyes narrowed . " It 's not slowing down  --  " He loaded another tranquilizer dart , and then another . They lanced into the grendel 's sides with dull phutts . It shrieked and twisted more frantically , clawing furrows in the rocky soil , snapping and glaringbalefully through the tangled netting . Jerry jumped back and shook his head . " Each of those carried enough somazine to knock over a rhino . I 'm afraid I just do n't understand how it 's wired  --  " The thing snarled and lunged at them , sendingfragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ground . Heat rose from its body in palpable waves , but it no longer seemed a threat to anyone but itself . " It 's dying , " Jerry said softly . Its labors were pitiful . It tried to head back toward the river , but the last six stakes held , and it just struggled at the end of the lines . And struggled . And struggled . " Is n't there anything that we can do ? " Cadmann said . " We could let it go . " " No , thank you . " The large body movements were growing spastic now , replaced with a kind of overall tremble , a desperate , dying convulsion . It exploded back into motion , moving so quickly that it scarcely seemed to be anything made of flesh , seemed more an engine with a shattered governor , a dark whirlwind . Its screech spiraled up and up and up the scale , clawing toward a terrifying crescendo . It bounced and thrashed at the end of the cables . The incredible effort went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in its body in one last all-out effort , nothing held hack , nothing in reserve for the functioning of any organ , just the now , now , now of a creaturep236with no way to tell its cortex that there is no threat . Then it was still . Only its tail tremored . The hunting crew moved back in and re-anchored the loose cables . Jerry , his face glum , poked at the thing 's tail with a long stick . It twitched reflexively . " Asleep ? " " Dead . " Jerry waved the Skeeters down . The netting was refastened , the cable hoists reattached . Cadmannwatched the Skeeters hoist the body , so hot it was almost sizzling , from the ground and into the air . CADMANN was one of the last back to the camp . He supervised the final disarming and removal of all unexploded mines , and accounted for all weaponry . Then he commandeered a Skeeter and spun it up toward the eternally gray bed of clouds pillowing the sky . The campfireshad been quenched , the tents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underbrush would grow in to obscure the scars , to conceal the fact that this effort had ever taken place . That a group of determined , prepared human beings had journeyed together into the darkness , to meet and destroy the greatest natural predator the children of Earth had ever faced . He breathed deeply as the Skeeter rose and headed north toward the mist-shrouded bulk of Mucking Great Mountain . The light of a setting Tau Ceti diffused redly through the clouds . AT FIRST the landing pad was an indistinguishable part of the sprawlingcamp , then a postage stamp , and then cracker-sized , and finally the familiar square studded with radio beacons and lights . Mary Ann stood there , looking a little rounder than when last he 'd seen her . A little warmer , more vulnerable . She shielded her face from the wind and dust . The smile beneath her forearm shadow was wide and bright and welcoming . She came to him , held him , and he buried his face in the warm notch between her neck and shoulder and felt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roar of dying Skeeter engines . The whipping air began to still , and at last he could hear her whispered words. "  --  you so much , " she said , and kissed him again . She looked up to him , eyes shining with pride and relief . " You 're done now , " she said.  | " Yes . " " Then let 's go home . " He kissed her this time , marveling at the simple pleasure it gave him . He nodded . " Let 's go home . "  |p238For  one swallow does not make a summer , nor does one day ; and so too one day , or a short time , or a great deed , does not make a man blessed or happy . ARISTOTLE , Nicomachaen EthicsTWEEDLEDUM BARKED energetically , wagged his tail and pranced to attract Cadmann 's attention . Cadmann chuckled indulgently and ignored him . He pointed down the hillside at the bare-chested workers who labored to widen his patio . " The house as planned now will be about twelve hundred square feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A warm wind from the south had blown away the usual mists . The view ran forever , from the tiny workmen across land and ocean to tiny mountains on the continent itself . It was as if he could see the whole planet . They 'll call it the new world . They always do Good day for this . Beside him , Carlos Martinez nodded solemnly : the role of video host suited him to the hilt . " I just can'tp239believe how much progress you 've made in the past five months . " " It 's been a lot of work , but given enough time and manpower , almost anything is possible  --  " " Hold it , Cad , " Sylvia called from the hillside above them . " The field of focus is off . " " Ca n't have that . Casa Weyland is the star of the show . " Cadmann swallowed his irritation while Carlos climbed up to help Sylvia fiddle with her video pack . Building a documentary had sounded great ten light years ago . It was fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society massively in debt . They were entitled to know the results . They would learn from the first expedition 's mistakes . Sales to Sol system 's twelve billion would help to finance a second expedition . In practice the running documentary had become a pain in the ass . Cadmann might have given the whole thing a pass but for the chance to see his two friends . He looked back down the hill , out over Cadmann 's Bluff , down to where Mary Ann sat holding Sylvia 's seven-week-old son . She waved one of Justin 's chubby hands at them , and some of his irritationdissolved . Three months of pregnancy remained to her , and it warmed him to have a preview of his future family . Mary Ann 's fringe of pale golden hair riffled in the mild salt breeze . She hugged their surrogate child while Tweedledee sat contentedly at her side . The sprawling silver ribbon of the Miskatonic split the valley behind and below her . His crops were coming up in rows of green and yellow now , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had wrested from the soil , but his true joy was the spreading infrastructure of his homestead . Hendrick Sills , Gregory Clifton and two former members of his kill team were immediately below him , deepening the boxlike foundationof his house . The original structure had been expanded east and west , but building farther back into the hill added the possibility of clerestories  --  staggered , louvered roofs that allowed greater view , greater access for light . The effort would have exhausted a lone man . In the three and a half months since the death of the sixth grendel , the Colony had demonstrated its gratitude in the only way it knew how : by contribut/ing time and labor . So the earth was broken , rocks moved and walls raised , floors and ceilings extended . Cadmann 's Bluff had become the showpiece of Tau Ceti Four . Carlos clumped back down the mountainside . " All right . Repitan , por favor . " " Hold it , Carlos , just hold it . This is getting old real quick . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The view is beautiful . I 've got the house , the bluff , the Colony , the northern mountains and the tips of the mainland peaks . Do you have any idea how rare it is for a hundred kilometers of mist to burn away ? " " That 's a once-in-a-lifetime shot , cornpadre . Our sponsors expect it . National Geographic wants us to show Earth 's landstarved masses the joys of homesteading in the stars  --  " " There goes the local neighborhood . " "  --  and one of its joys is the chance to become a hero , like Avalon 's greatest citizen , Cadmann Weyland , sometimes yclept Beo-wulf . " Sylvia whistled her approval . Cadmann laughed disgustedly . " All right , all right . Get the rest of your damned footage and let 's quit . " " Deal . " The camera ran . Carlos declaimed . They walked the perimeter of the cleared rectangle that would one day be the greenhouse . They skirted a new excavation to the northeast . " And here , " Carlos continued theatrically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Camelot . Stored on board Geographic are frozen cuttings from some of California 's finest vineyards . Someday , when the basic crops have stabilized , it may be time to start less .. . vital foodstuffs . " He cleared his throat . " Purely for medicinal purposes , of course . " " Carlos , do n't you know that grapes can be eaten straight ? " " No hablo Ingles . " They walked down the narrow path beside the house , past the massive boulder rigged as a deadfall , set to crush anything trying to force its way uphill . Cadmann winced as Carlos pretended to lean against it . Sylvia circled to get a better view . " This is probably an unnecessary precaution . The grendels are dead , slain by Colonel Cadmann Weyland . Even so , our Cadmann is a cautious fellow . " Cadmann raised his hand in protest . " Carlos . You 've got top241stop this . I do n't like being painted as Beowulf . I just did what had to be done . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . " " This is n't reality . This is theater . " " If it was only going to be seen throughout the solar system , fine . But you 're going to show it down in the Colony , too . It 's not good for them , it 's not good for me . " Cadmann left them and followed Tweedledum downhill . He knew that the colonists just wanted to thank him , and yet somehow it all seemed meaningless . Sure , you saved the Colony . Right . But Ernst is dead , and he was the only one you were really responsiblefor , dammit . He stopped down by the Dopey Joe cages . Their flock had grown to twenty , and Carlos had created a modular cage design for Mary Ann , simple to build or expand , easy to clean . Cadmann was happy with the new model , and the sight of it eased his annoyance . He put on another smile for the cameras . Just a few more minutes of this nonsense . Mary Ann was suddenly beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . They 'd love this image back on Earth . He leaned over and kissed her warmly . " Feeding time for our flock ? " " Just about . Justin is a nice baby , " she whispered , " but ours is going to be much prettier . " " Hush . " Cadmann grinned as Carlos and Sylvia caught up with them . He slipped a glove on , lifted a handful of green fodder into the slit at the top of Missy 's cage . He raised his voice as Sylvia focused . " And these little darlings are called Dopey Joes , ' the only indigenous mammalians found on Camelot so far . They may hold the key to a treasure trove of  --  ow ! " Missy snapped her sharp little teeth into his glove , and Cadmann struggled to twist it free without breaking her furry neck . " Bad girl . " Sylvia laughed . " No dessert for you . You ca n't just eat the meat and ignore your vegetables  --  " " Hah hah . Funny lady . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his glove and threw it at Carlos , who caught it and thoughtfully examined the rip in the fingertip . " Not exactly sheep , are they , Senora Weyland ? " " Baa baa . " Mary Ann took Justin to Sylvia . " Unhook that cam/era and give it to Carlos . Will you take Justin ? I want to talk to Cadmann . " There was a quick , clumsy exchange of burdens , and Mary Ann hooked her arm through Cadmann 's . " Carlos and Sylvie staying for dinner ? " she asked . He heard her distantly , but gazed up at the expanded house , strong and solid in the warm Avalonian sunlight . Up at the top of the hill , Gregory Clifton 's bronzed , corded body arched , swinging a pick to break up resistant soil . As with Carlos , the violent action and backbreaking labor of the pasts months had burned out Greg 's hatred and healed his emotional wounds . Cadmann found it easy to respect that response , that need . " Are Carlos and Sylvia staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and led him to the edge of the bluff . They looked down over the valley . They had done so very much , and given time would do more . He did n't have to close his eyes to visualizethe march of humanity across the valley , the slow spread of their cities . His grandchildren might live to see a city of a hundred thousandwhere once only jungle had sprawled . But false heroes would n't help . Especially if they were used as a blind for guilt and uncertainty . " I 'm worried too , " Mary Ann said quietly . " I 'm sorry . Am I upsetting you ? It 's nothing , really . " " You have your reasons , I have mine . " He held her tummy and frowned . " I think you think I 'm a little crazy . " " Pregnant women are supposed to be a little crazy . What 's my excuse ? " " Do n't need an excuse , you 've got reasons , silly . I just know that something still bothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the picture'swrong . " " It 's an alien planet . Did n't anyone tell you ? Two moons , bluer sunlight , critters and plants straight out of Oz  --  " Sylvia moved up beside her , cradling Justin in her arms . His hair was pale straw , and he seemed to fit comfortably into a shoulder harness . He nursed contentedly at one discreetly covered nipple . " I know what you mean , " she said . " We 're still working on the corpses . I do n't understand enough about grendels yet . I 'd give anything to have one alive . If we 'd known that they could burnp243themselves up like that , we might have cooled the last one off with water . " " It was that hot ? " Sylvia laughed . " It cooked itself . " " Heat . Fire , " Mary Ann muttered . " What ? " Mary Ann cuddled close to Cadmann . " I remember . . . I did a summer of study in the forests in Wyoming . And they told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . " Cadmann hugged her comfortingly as she searched her memory , struggling to make the unlikely connection . " They told us about what happens in fall . Then , a forest fire that seems to be out can smolder under a mat of leaves . You ca n't see it . You ca n't smell it . But it 's spreading underneath . It can surround you . And then suddenly break up to the surface , and whoosh ! " " Shh ... " " I 'm so glad you 're here , " she whispered . " I 'm so glad you 're mine . Do n't let anything happen to you , Cadmann . I 'm not sure I 'd know how to go on . I 'm not sure I 'd want to . " He was aware that Carlos and Sylvia were nearby , watching , and was also aware when they turned away to give the two of them privacy . For a moment Cadmann and Mary Ann were in their own secret world of warmth and familiar smells . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get dinner started for our crew . " THE EVENING 'S meal was a simple affair , an open-air picnic around a roaring campfire . Decent-sized catfish and a huge samlon from the nets were the main course , cooked into a casserole with long-grain brown rice from the hydroponics garden down at the Colony . Carlos and Sylvia and Hendrick 's four-man work team joined them . Cadmann watched Mary Ann pick over her food . She had a strong appetite for rice and catfish , but could n't bring herself to eat samlon . " More for the rest of us , " he had teased her at first , but her glum smile told him that the joke had died . Her eyes scanned from the edge of the bluff to the notebook at her side . From there to the Joe cages . Tonight the furry creatures chewed frantically at the wire and threw themselves against the wooden walls of their prisons . Carlos watched them for a while . ' The natives are restless . Dop244they think they 're going to be dessert ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sparks and oily smoke drifted up . The night was a continuation of the phenomenally clear afternoon . A faint salt breeze from the ocean five miles west made the air clean and crisp . The twin moons were bright and unshrouded . It should have been a night for laughter and song , but Cadmann felt another of his morose moods fall over him like a blanket . He could n't seem to fight it . Carlos tickled Justin , held the child for a few minutes , while Sylvia fed herself . The three of them seemed pretty damned comfortabletogether , and for a moment Cadmann indulged in pointless speculation . Then Mary Ann took his hand and placed it over her swollen stomach , smiling wistfully as their unborn child thumped and bumped . " Floop ( loop . " " Kid 's doing a half gainer in there . " " He loves you already , you know . " There was more sadness than joy in that conversation , and he did n't know why , did n't know how to deal with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fernando Valley spreading to oppositesides of a veranda . Carpets of light . Never again in my lifetime . Win something , lose something ... . Hendrick Sills watched the four of them ruminatively . With his short , square-cut beard he looked every bit the Freudian analyst . " What 's all the moping about ? " he finally demanded . " We got a cracking good day 's work under our belts . " " True enough , " Greg said . His calm oval face was painted with the firelight . It was growing more difficult to remember him in that other time , on that other night , spewing jellied gasoline , the glow of madness in his eyes . Carlos rose from the fireside . " I think that it 's time for Sylvia and me to head back down . " " You could spend the  --  no , there 's Justin . " Sylvia hugged Cadmann briefly . " Walk us to the Skeeter ? " " Sure . Mary Ann ? " " I 'm a little tired . You go ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . As they moved away toward the eastern edge of the bluff , Hendrick 's rough voice broke into song :  |p245Banish  the use of the four-letter wordsWhose meanings are never obscureThe Angles , the Saxons , those hardy old birds , Were vulgar , obscene , and impure . But cherish the use of the weaseling phrase That never quite says what you meanYou 'd better be known for your hypocrite ways Than as vulgar , impureand obscene ... . Another breeze stirred the foot-tall rows of corn as they walked . Cadmann found himself humming with the song , and he linked arms with his two friends . " It 's not so bad , is it , Cadzie ? " " It 's like Carlos said a couple of months ago : It 's been a whole lot worse . " ' He dug at the ground with the toe of his boot , making a mental note to get some of the soil lichens started soon . " I just wanted to have this to get away from everything , and I seem to have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You ca n't get away from  --  " Sylvia started to say , but Carlos quieted her . " Amigo , if you really do n't want us up here , any of us , just say the word . We love you . We 're grateful to you . We 're still embarrassed about the . . . fiasco . Hendrick , Greg , the others , they 're just responding to you the way men have responded to leaders since Alley Oop . " " I never wanted to be a leader . " " Some of us do n't have choices . Just let them do a little more work  --  hell , you can use it , you know that 's the truth  --  and then send them back . You 'll be alone , and Greg will have had his therapy . " It was true , all true , but dammit , why was it so hard for a man to just be alone ? When Nature is calling , plain speaking is out When the ladies , God bless ' em , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty the glass You can powder your nose , even Johnny can pass . Shake the dew off the lily , see a man about a dog When everyone 's drunk , it 's condensing the fog . But please to remember if you would know bliss That only in Shakespeare do characters " What the hell . Hendrick 's right . It 's been a good day . Listen , you two have a safe flight back . I 'm going to go sing dirty ditties . " He shook Carlos 's hand , kissed Justin and helped Sylvia buckle herself in . Then Cadmann stood back , shielding his eyes as Carlos expertly lifted the Skeeter from the ground and spun it up into the sky . His friend flashed the landing lights in farewell and vanished over the lip of the plateau . Feeling unseasonably warm , Cadmann walked back to the fireside , voice already rising in the next bawdy verse . " I THINK he 's going to make it , " Carlos said . " I never really doubted it . " Sylvia looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really seen the old Carlos much lately . " " Has he been missed ? " " Muchly . Avalan 's unmarried lovelies mourn almost nightly . " Carlos skimmed the Skeeter sideways , riding out a gust of wind . " What , in formal ceremonies ? Perhaps it is time I began making my rounds again . " He paused thoughtfully for a moment . " Only the unmarriedones ? " " Discretion , Carlos . Please . " " I 'm nothing if not discreet . " Carlos could have begun the descentthen , but he kept the Skeeter hovering . " And what about you ? " he asked soberly . " Terry 's problem is hardly a secret . I know how you and Cadmann feel about each other ... " " I promised Terry . Anyone but Cadmann . " She sighed . " I could n't anyway . It would destroy Mary Ann . Cadzie and I just .. . had bad timing . " Slowly , Carlos began to dip toward the landing pad . He chose his next words carefully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering voice was small . " Looking for a friend ? " Carlos reached out his hand , covering hers . Her fingers seemed so small , so warm . " Since Bobbi , I think that is what has stopped me . I have n't been looking for a relationship . Or just a palomita . I think I , too , need a friend . Perhaps ... " ... we could both stop looking ? " Sylvia squeezed Carlos 's fingers , then pulled away and hugged Justin to her . I hope so , Carlos said to himself , surprised by the intensity of hisp247response . Warmth and cheerfully lecherous optimism spread through him like a brushfire . Carlos hummed happily as he brought the Skeeter in for a landing.  |p248I  strongly wish for what I faintly hope ; Like the daydreams of melancholy men , I think and think in things impossible , Yet love to wander in that golden maze . JOHN DRY DEN , " Rival Ladies " SYLVIA TOUCHED her lips to Justin 's brow . She savored his baby smell of powder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was careful not to touch him as she tucked the edges of the blanket around him . Seven weeks old today . I should remind Terry . Justin had begun to lose the newborn 's wrinkly look , to cease being a generic baby and take on a personality of his own . He could focus his eyes , reach and grab with coordination , make sounds that often seemed appropriate to the situation . Terry had read Kistakovsy 's classic revisions of the Gesell studies and pronounced Justin well ahead of normal development . Those things mattered , but there was a way that they did n't . Genius or idiot , she loved the tiny , helpless child as she had never loved anything in her life , as if he were still a part of her own body . Plastic stars and pterodons dangled above his crib . They would circle at the slightest touch of a breeze . For now , they , like Justin , were still.  |p249Terry  was in the front room clearing away the debris of the eveningmeal . Her hands shook . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to calm down , and thrust them beneath her arms until they started to feel warm . Terry stacked the last dishes in the cabinet beneath the sink . One hand gripping the wheelchair arm , muscles in his arm and back standing prominent as he leaned far forward to reach . Done , and he smiled in satisfaction . His wheelchair purled as he glided it over to her . " Justin asleep ? " " For now , " she said , honestly relieved . She waved at the sink area . " You 're getting good at that . Making order out of chaos . " " Yeah . What I am , I 'm good at . I never had arms this strong . Which reminds me  --  " " The expedition . " " Yeah . Time to turn the plans over to Zack . It could be five or ten years before anyone actually goes to the mainland , but hell , our resources wo n't have changed much . The plans 'll still be good . I 'm afraid to tell Cadmann . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I 've expressed enough milk to keep Justin happy if he wakes up . I 'll only be gone a couple of hours . " She stretched , forcing a mild yawn . " We have to get the tapes edited and off . We 're overdue on our broadcast . " " You 've been busy , " Terry said . His face , always slender , seemed unhealthily gaunt despite his smile . She knelt by the wheelchair . " You 'll be all right ? " " Oh , I 'm fine . " His quick smile faded slightly , and he was lookingpast her . His gaze lingered on diplomas and plaques , a photo album , a pair of crystal goblets : the things they had brought from Earth . " What are you thinking of , love ? " His smile saddened . " It 's been a long time since you 've called me that . " " I 've thought of it every day . " " Have you ?
