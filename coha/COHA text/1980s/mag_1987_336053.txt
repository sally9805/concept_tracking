Armed men approach the car , clearly intending harm to its passengers . Ryan singlehanded puts a stop to this nefariousness , suffering a shoulder wound in the process . Next morning in the hospital , he learns that he has rescued the Prince and Princess of Wales from a terrorist attack by the U.L.A. , a Maoist offshoot of the Irish Republican Army . <P> Pretty soon the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh arrive to pay their respects , telling Ryan that his wife and young daughter are safely ensconced in Buckingham Palace and that he is now Sir John , a Knight Commander of the Victorian Order .

When , for instance , the Princess announces that she is two months pregnant , Ryan knows just what the etiquette of the situation demands . He turns to the Prince and says , " Way to go , sir .
