Brideshead Revisited ( PBS ) . Faithful , sometimes to a fault , to Evelyn Waugh 's most popular novel , this visually ravishing series offered a lovely elegy to a time that never was . Eleven episodes that warmed an Anglophile 's winter . <P> CBS Cable . An arts showcase that , in its 14 months on the air , presented some of the medium 's finest theater ( Sizwe Banzi Is Dead ) , dance ( Twyla Tharp 's Confessions of a Cornermaker ) , film ( The Tree of Wooden Clogs ) , music ( a series on Broadway composers ) and conversation ( Gregory Jackson 's Signature ) . After losing an estimated $30 million , it expired on Dec. 16-one of 1982 's saddest death notices . <P> Donkey Kong ( Coleco Industries Inc . ) . Video games continue to crowd TV programs off the family tube . This one , probably the best translation of an arcade game to home use , boasts bemusing graphics and the most congenial cast ( savage ape , imperiled heroine , undaunted hero ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letterman ( NBC ) . Laid-back and amiably hip , Letterman presides over a menagerie of stupid pet tricks , oddball celebrities and the man with the worm farm . A lullaby for the eccentric insomniac . <P> Life On Earth ( PBS ) . A tale of wonders , the saga of evolution and the ascent of life , from bacteria to man , lovingly told by British Host David Attenborough . <P> MTV ( Warner Amex Satellite Entertainment Co . ) . Basically FM with pictures , MTV ( Music Television ) is a 24-hour cable service whose imaginative videotapes illustrating rock recordings expand TV 's generally unadventurous visual vocabulary . <P> NBC News Overnight . TV 's wittiest , toughest , least snazzy news strip . The late hour ( 1:30 a.m . E.S.T. ) allows for lengthy and caustic reports , sutured by two droll , articulate anchors : Lloyd Dobyns ( now succeeded by Bill Schechner ) and Linda Ellerbee . <P> Police Squad ! ( ABC ) . The folks responsible for the hit movie Airplane ! found TV a congenial medium to spoof cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and went in six spring episodes ; it should have stayed . <P> Roses In December ( PBS ) . A taut documentary by Ana Carrigan and Bernard Stone about the killing of Jean Donovan , a lay missionary who worked with the Maryknoll nuns in El Salvador . An exemplary piece of humane film making that avoided political sentimentality and glib answers . <P> Sweeney Todd ( The Entertainment Channel ) . Terry Hughes directed Stephen Sondheim 's operatic musical for cable with seamless theater and TV technique . George Hearn was magnificent as Sweeney , the misanthropic cutthroat ; Angela Lansbury was delectably deranged as his helpmeet.
