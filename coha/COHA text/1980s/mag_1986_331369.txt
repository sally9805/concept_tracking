" Where in hell is the bird ? Where is the bird ? " shouted a space engineer at Cape Canaveral . " Oh , my God ! " cried a teacher from the viewing stands nearby . " Do n't let happen what I think just happened . " Nancy Reagan , watching television in the White House family quarters , gasped similar words , " Oh , my God , no ! " So too did William Graham , the acting administrator of NASA , who was watching in the office of a Congressman . " Oh , my God , " he said . " Oh , my God . " <P> Across the nation , people groped for words . " It exploded , " murmured Brian French , a senior at Concord High School in New Hampshire , as the noisy auditorium fell quiet . A classmate , Kathy Gilbert , turned to him and asked , " Is that really where she was ? " At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , scientists turned away from their remarkable new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the telecast from Florida . " We all knew it could happen one day , " said one , " but , God , who would have believed it ? " <P> It had happened . In one fiery instant , the nation 's complacent attitude toward manned space flight had evaporated at the incredible sight in the skies over Cape Canaveral . <P> Americans had soared into space 55 times over 25 years , and their safe return came to be taken for granted . An age when most anyone , given a few months ' training , could go along for a safe ride seemed imminent . Christa McAuliffe was the pioneer and the vibrant symbol of this amazing new era of space for Everyman . An ebullient high school social-studies teacher from Concord , N.H. , she was to be the first ordinary citizen to be shot into space , charged with showing millions of watchful schoolchildren how wonderful it could be . She was bringing every American who had ever been taught by a Mrs. McAuliffe into this new era with her . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to horror as the reality became all too clear : McAuliffe and six astronauts had disappeared in an orange- and-white fireball nine miles above the Atlantic Ocean . So too had the space shuttle Challenger , the trusted $1.2 billion workhorse on which they had been riding . Transfixed by the terrible sight of the explosion , Americans watched as it was replayed again and again . And yet again . Communal witnesses to tragedy , they were bound , mostly in silence , by a nightmarish image destined to linger in the nation 's shared consciousness . <P> Then the national mood shifted . America wept . From the White House to farmhouses , Americans joined in mourning their common loss . Flags were lowered to half-staff . Makeshift signs appeared in countless cities : WE SALUTE OUR HEROES . GOD BLESS THEM ALL . President Reagan , in a moving broadcast to the nation that afternoon , paraphrased a sonnet written by John Gillespie Magee , a young American airman killed in World War II : " We will never forget them nor the last time we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved goodbye and ' slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God .
