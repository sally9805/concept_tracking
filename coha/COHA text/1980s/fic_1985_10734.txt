" Slow down , will you ? " The Gnome freed his arm irritably . " They 're all fine and they 're all here , so stop worrying . The Elf took a dart in the shoulder , but he 'll live . Only one who 's in danger at the moment is me . And that 's because I 'm shut up in this room with you , dying of boredom ! Now will you climb out of that bed so we can get out of here ? " Jair did n't hear all of what the Gnome was saying . Everyone 's all right , he was repeating to himself . Everyone made it . No one was lost , even though it had seemed certain that some of them must be . He breathed deeply in relief . Something the King of the Silver River had said recalled itself suddenly to his mind . A touch of magic for each who journey with you , the old man had told him . Strength for the body , given to others . Perhaps that strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them safely through last night . " Get up , get up , get up ! " Slanter was practically hopping up and down with impatience . " What are you doing just sitting there ? " Jair swung his legs out of the bed and glanced about the room in which he found himself . It was a small , stone block chamber , sparsely furnished with bed , sitting table , and chairs , its walls bare save for a broad heraldic tapestry hung from the far supports of its sloped ceiling . A second window opened out at the other end of the wall against which Jair 's bed rested , and a single wooden door stood closed , opposite where he sat . In one corner , a small fireplace cradled an iron gate and a stack of burning logs . He glanced at Slanter . " Where are we ? " Slanter looked at him as if he were a complete idiot . " Now where do you think we are ? We 're inside the Dwarf fortress ! " Where else ? Jair thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength as he stretched and peered curiously out of the window in back of him . Through its narrow , barred slot he could see the murky gray expanse of the Cillidellan stretching away into a day thick with mist and low-hanging clouds . Far distant , through this shifting haze , he could discern the flicker of watchfires burning along the shores of the lake . Gnome watchfires . Then he noticed how quiet it was . He was within the fortress of Capaal , the Dwarf citadel that stood watch over the locks and dams that regulated the flow of the Silver River westward , thep201citadel that one day earlier had been under assault by Gnome armies . Where were those armies now ? Why was n't Capaal under attack ? " Slanter , what 's happened to the siege ? " he asked quickly . " Why is it so still ? " " How should I know ? " the other snapped . " No one tells me anything ! " " Well , what 's happening out there ? What have you seen ? " Slanter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've said , have you ? What 's the problem  --  ears not working or something ? I 've been right here in this room with you ever since they dragged you out of the lake ! Shut away like a common thief ! Saved that confounded Borderman 's skin out there and what do I get for my trouble ? Shut in here with you ! " " Well , I . . . " A Gnome 's a Gnome , they think ! Do n't trust any of us ! So here I sit , mother hen to you while you slumber on like you do n't have a care in the world . Waited all day for you to decide to wake up ! You 'd be sleeping still , I suppose , if I had n't lost patience entirely ! " Jair drew back . " You could have woken me sooner ... " " How could I do that ! " the other exploded . " How was I to know what was wrong with you ? Could have been anything ! Had to let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances , could I ? That black devil Weapons Master would have had me flayed ! " Jair grinned in spite of himself . " Calm down , will you ? " The Gnome clenched his teeth . " I 'll calm down when you get yourself out of that bed and into your clothes ! There 's a guard on the other side of that door keeping me shut up in here ! But with you awake , maybe we can talk him into letting the two of us out ! Then you can be amused on your own time ! Now , dress ! " Shrugging , Jair slipped off the night clothes that had been provided him and began pulling on his Vale clothes . He was surprised , though pleased , to find Slanter so vocal again , even if his discourse was , for the moment at least , limited to a tirade against the Valeman . Slanter seemed more his normal self again , more that voluble fellow he had been that first night after making Jair his prisoner in the highlands  --  that fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the Gnome had chosen now to comep202out of his shell , but he was delighted to have the old Slanter back as company once more . " Sorry you had to be locked in here with me , " he ventured after a moment . " You ought to be , " the other grumbled . " They put me in here to look after you , you know . Must think I make a good nursemaidor something . " Jair grinned . " I 'd say they 're right . " The expression that crossed the Gnome 's face then caused Jair to turn away quickly , his face a carefully frozen mask . Chuckling inwardly , he was in the process of reaching for his boots when he abruptly rememberd the vision crystal and the Silver Dust . He had not seen either while dressing . He had not felt them in his pockets . The grin he had allowed to slip back over his face faded . He ran his hands over his clothing . Nothing ! Frantically , he pawed through his bedding , his bedclothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Silver Dust were gone . Then he thought back to the night previous , to the long jump into the Cillidellan . Had he lost them in the lake ? " Looking for something ? " Jair stiffened . It was Slanter speaking , his voice laced with false concern . Jair turned . " Slanter , what have you done . . . ? " " Me ? " the other interrupted quickly , feigned innocence in the crafty face . " Your devoted nursemaid ? " Jair was furious . " Where are they , Slanter ? Where did you put them ? " Now it was the Gnome 's turn to grin . " Enjoyable as this is  --  and believe me , it is enjoyable  --  I have better things to do . So if it 's the pouch and the crystal you 're looking for , the Weapons Master has them . Took them off you last night when they brought you in here and stripped you . Would n't trust them to my care , of course . " He folded his arms across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to this . Or do you need help dressing , too ? " Jair flushed , finished dressing , then wordlessly walked over to the wooden door and knocked . When the door opened , he informed the Dwarf standing guard that they would like to go out . The Dwarf frowned , told them to stay put , glanced suspiciouslyat Slanter , and pulled the door firmly shut again.  |p203Growing  curiosity over the absence of any sort of battle withoutand impatience with things in general notwithstanding , they had to wait fully an hour before the door to the room opened a second time , and the guard at last beckoned them to follow . Leaving the room hastily , they turned down a windowless corridorthat ran past dozens of doors similar to the one they had just passed through , climbed a series of stairs , and emerged on battlements overlooking the murky waters of the Cillidellan . Wind and a faint spray blew off the lake into their faces , the midday air chill and hard . Here , too , the day was still and expectant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched between the peaks that sheltered the locks and dams . Dwarf sentries patrolled the walls , eyes shifting watchfully through the haze . There was no sign of the Gnome armies , save for the distant flicker of the watchfires , reddish specks of light in the gray. 0 The Dwarf took them down off the battlements , turning into a broad courtyard that spanned the center of the high dam where it walled away the Cillidellan . North and south of where they walked , the towers and parapets of the Dwarf fortress rose up against the leaden sky , stretching away into mist . It was an eerie , ghostly look that the day lent to the citadel , shrouding it in halflightand haze so that it almost seemed as if it were something strayed from a dream that threatened to be gone in a moment 's time upon waking . Few Dwarves were in evidence here , the vast courtyard all but deserted . Stairwells burrowed down into the stone at regular intervals  --  black tunnels that Jair presumed must run to the inner workings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a shout brought them up short , and Edain Elessedil came running to greet them . Grinning broadly , his injured arm and shoulder heavily wrapped , he went to Jair at once and extended his hand in greeting . " Safe and sound after all , Jair Ohmsford ! " He put his good arm about the other as they turned once more to follow their taciturn guide . " Feeling better , I hope ? " " Much better . " Jair smiled back . " How is your arm ? " " Just a small scratch . A little stiff and nothing more . But what a night ! Lucky that any of us got through safely . And this one ! "  |p204He  indicated Slanter , who trailed a step behind . " His escape was nothing short of miraculous ! Did he tell you ? " Jair shook his head , and Edain Elessedil promptly informedhim of all that had befallen Slanter and Helt during their harrowingwalk through the Gnome encampment the previous night . Jair listened with growing astonishment , casting more than one glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference , Slanter was looking a bit embarrassed by all the attention . " Simplest way out , that 's all , " Slanter announced gruffly whenthe effusive Elf had finished his tale . Jair was smart enough notto make anything more out of it . Their guide took them up a stairway onto the battlement onthe northern watch , then led them through a set of double-doors into an atrium filled with plants and trees , flourishing in an obviouslytransplanted bed of black earth beneath glass and open sky . Even here , within the high mountains , the Dwarves carried with them something of their home , Jair thought in admiration . Beyond the gardens lay a terrace occupied by tables andbenches . " Wait here , " the Dwarf ordered and left them . When he had gone , Jair turned back to Edain . " Why is thereno battle being fought this day , Elven Prince ? What of theGnome armies ? " Edain Elessedil shook his head . " No one seems certain whathas happened . The locks and dams have been under siege for almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposures ofthe fortress . But today , no attack has come . The Gnomes gather at their siege lines and watch us  --  nothing more . It appears as if they are waiting for something . " " I do n't like the sound of that , " Slanter muttered . " Nor do the Dwarves , " Edain said quietly . " Runners havebeen sent to Culhaven and scouts slip through the underground tunnels to the rear of the Gnome army to keep watch . " He hesitated , then glanced at Jair . " Garet Jax is out there , too . " Jair started . " He is ? Why ? Where has he gone ? " " I do n't know , " the Elf shook his head slowly . " He said nothing to me . I do n't think he 's left us . I think he 's simply out looking around . He took Helt with him . "  | " Scouting on his own , then . " Slanter frowned . " He would do that . " " Who can say ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps his own counsel , Slanter . " " Dark reasons and dark purposes drive that one , " the Gnome muttered , almost to himself . They stood in silence then for a few moments , not looking at each other , lost in their private speculations of the actions of Garet Jax . Jair remembered Slanter telling him that it was the Weapons Master who had possession now of the vision crystal and the Silver Dust . That meant that if anything were to happen to Garet Jax , the magic of the King of the Silver River would be lost . And that meant that Jair 's only chance of helping Brin would be lost as well . The sound of the door opening brought them about , and Forakerappeared from out of the fortress . He came quickly to where they stood and greeted each with a handshake . " Rested , Ohmsford ? " he asked gruffly , and Jair nodded . " Good . I 've asked that dinner be brought to us here on the terrace , so why do n't we find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest to them , and the other three joined him there . The trees and shrubs of the gardens darkened further the gray cast of the late afternoon , so candles were lighted against the gloom . Moments later , a meal of beef , cheese , bread , soup , and ale was brought , and they began to eat . Jair was surprised to discover how hungry he was . When the meal was finished , Foraker pushed back from the table and began fishing through his pockets . " I have something for you . " He glanced briefly toward Jair . " Ah-ha , here we are . " He held in his hand the bag of Silver Dust and the vision crystal on its silver chain . He pushed them across the table to the Valeman . " Garet said to give these to you . Said to keep them safe until you woke . He had a message for you , too . He said to tell you that you showed courage last night . " Surprise flashed over the Valeman 's face , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced self-consciously at Edain Elessedil and Slanter , then back to the Dwarf . " Where is he now ? " he stammered . Foraker shrugged . " He 's gone with the Borderman to explore a passage that will take us out from the fortress behind thep206Gnome siege lines north . He wants to be certain it 's safe before we all go . And we go at nightfall tomorrow . Ca n't wait any longer on the siege ; it may go on for months . We 've been shut away too long already for his taste . " " Some of us have been more shut away than others , " Slanter grumbled pointedly . Foraker faced him , brows knitting fiercely . " We have vouched for you , Gnome  --  all those who came with you from Culhaven . Radhomm , who commands this garrison , feels that our word is enough . But there are some within these walls who feel much differently  --  some who have lost friends and loved ones to the Gnomes who lay siege without . For them , our assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard not as a prisoner , but as a charge . Your safety is of some concern , believe it or not  --  particularly to Ohmsford here . " " I can look after myself , " Slanter muttered darkly . " And I do n't need anyone 's concern  --  especially this boy 's ! " Foraker stiffened . " That ought to come as good news to him ! " he snapped . Slanter lapsed into silence . He withdraws into himself again , thought Jair ; he shields himself from everything happening about him . It is only when he is alone with me that he seems to be willing to come out of that protective shell . It is only then that he seems to recover even a bit of the old Slanter he showed when we first met . The balance of the time he is an outsider , a self-proclaimed loner , unaccepting of his role as a member of our little company . " Did our message get through ? " Edain Elessedil was asking Foraker . " About the destruction of the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dwarf removed his dark gaze from Slanter . " Your plan was well conceived , Elven Prince . Had we known better the extent of this siege and the army that mounts it , we might have escaped in the bargain . " " Are we in danger here , then ? " " No , the fortress is secure . Stores are plentiful enough to withstand a siege of months if need be . And no army can bring the whole of its strength to bear with the mountains so close . Any danger to us will be found outside these walls when we resume our journey north . "  |p207At  his elbow , Slanter muttered something unintelligible and drained the remainder of his ale . Foraker glanced at the Gnome and his bearded face tightened . " In the meantime , there is something that must be done  --  and you and I , Gnome , must do it . " Slanter 's eyes lifted guardedly . " What is it we must do  --  Dwarf ? " Foraker 's face darkened further , but his voice stayed calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know well the castle of the Mord Wraiths  --  someone who claims to know it better than anyone . If true , that knowledge could be of great use to us . " " If true , then you have no further use for me ! " Slanter snapped . " What have I to do with this ? " " The knowledge is of use only if it is true , " Foraker continued carefully . " The only one who can tell us that is you . " " Me ? ' The Gnome laughted mirthlessly . " You would trust me to tell you whether or not what you are being told is the truth ? Why should you do that ? Or do you think to test me ? That seems more likely , I think . You would test what I tell you against what another says ! " " Slanter ! " Jair admonished the Gnome , a flush of anger and disappointment stealing through him . " You are the one who mistrusts , " Edain Elessedil added firmly . Slanter started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Foraker who spoke then , low and pointed . " If I thought to test you , it would not be against this one . " The table was silent . " Who is it ? " Slanter asked finally . The Dwarf 's fierce brows knitted . " A Mwellret . " Slanter went rigid . " A Mwellret ? " he growled . " A lizard ? " He said it with such loathing that Jair Ohmsford and Edain Elessedil looked at each other in astonishment . Neither had ever seen a Mwellret . Neither had even heard of one until now , and both , having witnessed the Gnome 's reaction to the mention of one , wondered if perhaps they would have been better off remainingignorant . " One of Radhomm 's patrols found him washed up at the edge of the lake a day or two before the siege , " Foraker went on , his eyes holding Slanter 's . " More dead than alive when they pulledp208him out . Mumbled something about being driven from the Ravenshornby the black walkers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed . The patrol brought him here . Did n't have time to get him out before the siege . " He paused . " Until now , there had been no way to test the truth of what he has to say . " " The truth ! " Slanter spit . " There is no truth in the lizards ! " " Revenge against those he feels have wronged him may bring out the truth . We can offer him that revenge  --  a trade , perhaps . Think carefully . He must know the secrets of the Ravenshorn and Graymark . Those mountains were once his . The castle was his . " " Nothing was ever his ! " Slanter came out of his chair with a lunge , stiff with anger . " They took it all , the lizards did ! Built their castle on the bones of my people ! Made slaves of the Gnome tribes living in the mountains ! Used the dark magic like the walkers ! Black devils , I would as soon cut my own throat as give them an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising as well . " Slanter , what . . . ? " " A moment , Ohmsford , " Foraker cut him short . The fierce countenance turned again to Slanter . " Gnome , I give the Mwellretsno more trust than you . But if this one can help , then let us take whatever help we find . Our task is difficult enough as it is . And if we find that the Mwellret lies . . . well , then we know what can be done with him . " Slanter glared down at the table in front of him wordlessly for a moment , then slowly reseated himself . " It is a waste of time . Go without me . Use your own judgment , Foraker . " The Dwarf shrugged . " I thought that this would be preferable to being left under lock and key . I thought you might have had enough of that . " He paused , watching the dark eyes of the Gnome snap up to find his own . " Besides , my judgment is uselessin determining whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one who can help us with that . " For a moment , no one spoke . Slanter 's eyes remained locked on Foraker . " Where is the Mwellret now ? " he asked finally . " In a storage room that serves as his cell , " Foraker answered . " He never comes out , even to walk . Does n't like the air and the light . "  | " Black devil ! " the Gnome muttered in response . Then he sighed . " Very well . You and me . " " These two as well , if they choose . " Foraker indicated Jair and Edain . " I 'm coming , " Jair announced at once . " And I , " the Elven Prince agreed . Foraker rose to his feet and nodded . " I 'll take you there now . "  |p210They  went from the terrace gardens down into the bowels of the locks and dams of Capaal . From the gray light of an afternoon rapidly fading into dusk , they descended stairwells and passageways that curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools of hazy light given off by the flames of oil lamps dangling from iron brackets . The air trapped within the massive rock of the dam was stale and damp . Through the silence that pervaded the lower levels came the distant rush of waters flowing through the locks and the low grinding of great wheels and levers . Closed doors came and went as the four passed deeper , and there was the sense of a beast hidden somewherewithin , stirring in response to the sounds of the locks and their machinery , caged and waiting to break free . They came upon few Dwarves within these levels of the fortress . A forest people who had survived the Great Wars by tunnelingwithin the earth , the Dwarves had long since emerged from their underground prison into the sunlight and in so doing had vowed never again to return . Their abhorrence of dark , closed places was well known among the people of the other races , and it was only with some difficulty that they managed to endure such closures . The locks and dams at Capaal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waters of the Silver River as they flowed westward to their homeland , and so the sacrifice was made  --  but never for long and never more frequently than was required . Brief shifts to monitor the machinerythat they had built to serve their purposes were followed by hasty exits back into the world of light and air above . So it was that the few faces the four companions did come upon as they made their way downward bore a look of stoicp211endurance that barely masked an abiding distaste for this most unpleasant of duties . Elb Foraker evidenced a trace of this , though he bore his discomfortwell . His fierce , dark face was turned forward into the maze of corridors and stairwells , and his solid frame was erect and purposeful as he took his companions through lamplight and shadow toward the storage room yet further down . As they went , he told Jair and Edain Elessedil the story of the Mwellrets . They were a species of Troll , he explained in beginning his tale . The Trolls had survived the Great Wars above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energies those wars had unleashed . Mutated from the men and women they had once been , they had altered in form , their skin and body organs adaptingto the frightening conditions the Great Wars had created over almost the whole of the earth 's surface . Northland Trolls had survived within the mountains , grown huge and strong , their skin toughened until it had taken on the appearance of rough tree bark . But the Mwellrets were the descendants of men who had sought to survive within forests that the Great Wars had turned to swamp , the waters poisoned , the foliage diseased . Assumingthe characteristics of creatures for whom swamp survival was most natural , the Mwellrets had taken on the look of reptiles . When Slanter called them lizards , he was describing them in truth as they now appeared  --  scaled over where skin had once been , arms and legs grown short and clawed , and bodies grown as flexible as snakes . But there was a greater difference yet between the Mwellrets and the other species of Trolls that occupied the dark corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the ladder of civilization had been more rapid , and it had been marked by a strange and frightening ability to shape-change . Survival had made fearful demands upon the Mwellrets , as upon all of the Trolls ; in the process of learning the secrets of that survival , they had undergone a physical transformation that enabled them to alter body shape with the pliability of oiled clay . Not so advanced in their art as to be able to disguise their basic characteristics , they nevertheless could shorten or elongate all of the parts of their bodies and could mold themselves in ways that would allow them to adapt to the demands of any environment in which they found themselves . Little was known as to how the shape-chang/ing was done . It was enough to know that it could be done and to know that the Mwellrets were the only creatures who had mastered it . Few beyond the borders of the Eastland knew of the Mwellrets , for they were a reclusive and solitary people who seldom ventured beyond the shelter of the deep Anar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Councils at Paranor . No Mwellrets had fought in the Wars of the Races . Withdrawn into their dark homeland , within forest , swamp , and mountain wilderness , they had kept themselves apart . Except where the Gnome people were concerned , that was . Sometime after the First Council at Paranor , a time more than a thousand years earlier , the Mwellrets had migrated up from swampland and broken forest into the wooded heights of the Ravenshorn . Leaving the dank and fetid mire of the lowlands to the creatures with whom they had shared those regions since the destruction of the old world , the Mwellrets had drifted into the higher forestlands inhabited by scattered tribes of Gnomes . A superstitious people , the Gnomes had been terrified of these creatures who could change shape and who seemed to command elements of the dark magic that had been brought to life with the advent of the Druids . In time , the Mwellrets began to take advantage of that fear and to assert their authority over the tribes living within the Ravenshorn . Mwellrets assumed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves . At first , there was resistance to these creatures  --  these lizards , as they were called  --  but after a time all resistance ceased . The Gnomes were not strong enough or organized enough to fight back , and a few terrifying examples of what would be done to those who failed to submit made a lasting impression on the others . Under the rule of the Mwellrets , the fortress at Graymarkwas constructed  --  a massive citadel from which the lizards governed the tribes inhabiting the immediate region . Years passed , and the whole of the Ravenshorn fell under the sway of the Mwellrets . Dwarves to the south and Gnome tribes to the north and west stayed out of those mountains , and the Mwellrets in turn showed no inclination to venture beyond their newly adopted home . With the coming of the Warlock Lord in the Second War of the Races , it was rumored that a bargain had been struck in which the lizards offered a number of their Gnomep213subjects to serve the Dark Lord  --  but there was never anyone who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the aborted Third War of the Races  --  the war in which Shea Ohmsford had gone in search of the mystic Sword of Shannara and the Warlock Lord had been destroyed  --  the Mwellrets had unexpectedly begun to die out . Age and sickness began to deplete their numbers and only a handful of young were born into the world . As their numbers declined , so did their sway over the Gnome tribes in the Ravenshorn . Bit by bit , their small empire crumbled away until at last it was limited to Graymark and the few tribes that still remainedwithin that region of the world . " And now it seems that these last few , too , have been driven back into the swamps that bred them , " Foraker concluded his tale . " Whatever their power , it was no match for that of the walkers . Like the Gnomes they ruled , they would become slaves as well , were they to remain within the mountains . " " Better they had been wiped from the face of the earth ! " Slanter interjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do they in truth possess the power of the dark magic ? " Jair asked . Foraker shrugged . " I 've never seen it . The magic is in the shape-changing , I think . Oh , there are stories of the ways in which they affect the elements  --  wind , air , earth , fire , and water . Maybe there is some truth to that simply because they have developed an understanding of how the elements react to certain things . But for the most part , it is just superstition . " Slanter muttered something unintelligible and gave Jair a dark look that suggested he was n't in complete agreement with the Dwarf . " You will be safe enough , Ohmsford . " Foraker smiled gravely . The dark brows lifted . " If he were foolish enough to use the magic within these walls , he would be dead quicker than you could blink ! " Ahead , the darkened corridor grew suddenly light , and the four approached an intersecting passageway and a line of doors stretching down to their right . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hard eyes turned to oversee their approach . Foraker spoke a quick word in greeting and ordered thatp214the door be opened . The sentries glanced at each other and shrugged . " Take a light , " the first said , passing Foraker an oil lamp . " The lizard keeps it black as pitch in there all the time . " Foraker lighted the lamp from the wick of one hanging beside the door , then glanced over at his companions . " Ready , " he told the sentries . Latch bolts released and a crossbar lifted . With a mournful groan , the ironbound door swung open into total blackness . Forakerstarted forward wordlessly , the other three a step behind . As the faint circle of the oil lamp penetrated the gloom , the humped and shadowed forms of crates , packing cases , and sack stores came into view . The Dwarf and his companions stopped . Behind them , the door swung closed with a bang . Jair glanced about the darkened room apprehensively . A rank and fetid odor permeated the air , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay over everything , deep and silent about their little light . " Stythys ? " Foraker spoke the name quietly . For a long moment , there was no answer . Then from the shadowsto their left , from out of a corner of crates and stores , a stirring broke the silence . " Who iss it ? " something hissed . " Foraker , " the Dwarf answered . " I 've come to talk . Radhomm sent word to you that I would come . " " Hss ! " The voice rasped like chain being dragged over stone . " Sspeak what you would , Dwarf . " Something moved within the shadows  --  something huge and cloaked like death itself . A shape appeared , vague and shadowy , rising up beside the stores . Jair felt a sudden , overwhelming repulsion for what was there . Keep very still , a voice within him warned . Say nothing ! " Little peopless , " the figure murmured coldly . " Dwarf and Elvess and Gnome . Musst n't be frightened , little peopless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foraker snapped impatiently . " Hss ! Do n't like the light . Need darknesss ! " Foraker shrugged . " Then we 'll both stay where we are . " " Sstay , " the other agreed.  |p215Jair  glanced quickly at Slanter . The Gnome 's rough face was twisted in a mask of hatred and disgust , and he was sweating . He looked as if he might bolt at any moment . Edain Elessedil must have seen the look , too , for all at once he moved around Jair and Foraker and placed himself almost protectively on the other side of the distraught Gnome . " I 'm fine ! " Slanter muttered almost inaudibly , brushing with his hand at the darkness before him . Then abruptly the Mwellret came forward to the edge of the light , a tall , cloaked form that seemed to materialize from out of the shadows . Essentially man-shaped , it walked upright on two powerful hind legs , crooked and muscled . Forearms reached out tentatively , and where there should have been skin and hair there was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within its cowl , the Mwellret 's face turned toward them , reptilian snout lifting into the light , scaled and split wide to reveal rows of sharpened teeth and a serpent 's tongue . Nostrils flared at the snout 's blunt end ; further up , almost lost within the cowl 's darkness , slitted green eyes glimmered . " Sstythyss knowss what bringss you , little peopless , " the monsterhissed slowly . " Knowss well . " There was silence . " Graymark , " Foraker said finally . " Wraithss , " the other whispered . " Sstythyss knowss . Walkerss that desstroy . Come from out of the pitss , from the black hole of the Maelmord . From death ! Climbss to Heaven'ss Well to Poisson the waterss of the Ssilver River .

" Slanter spit suddenly into the darkness , muttering as he shifted back a step and kicked at the stone flooring . " Sstay ! " the Mwellret hissed suddenly , an unmistakable tone of command in its voice . Slanter 's head snapped up . " Gnomess have no need to fear uss . Friendss have we been  --  not like the Wraithss . Wraithss desstroy all that iss life becausse they are not life . Thingss of death ! The dark magic ruless . All the landss will fall to them . "  | " But you have a way to destroy them !

" " Passages ! " Jair exclaimed suddenly , so intent on what the other was telling them that for an instant he forgot his vow . At once the Mwellret 's head snapped up , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of something tremendously evil settling over him as he stood there in the sudden silence . The Mwellret 's serpent tongue snaked out . " Magicss , little friend ? Magicss do you have ? " No one spoke . Jair was sweating violently . Foraker glanced about at him sharply , momentarily uncertain as to what had happened . " In your voisse , little friend ? " the Mwellret whispered . " Ssense it in your voisse , I do . Ssense it in you . Magicss like my own . Do it for me , yess ? Sspeak ! " Something seemed to wrap itself about Jair , some invisible coil that squeezed the breath from him . Before he could help himself he began to sing . Quick and sharp , the wishsong slipped from between his clenched teeth and waves of color and shape rode the air between them , dancing through the darkness and lamplight like living things . An instant later Jair was free again , the coils that had bound him gone . The wishsong died into silence . The Valeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slanter was at his side at once , pulling him back toward the door , yelling wildly at the Mwellret , grappling with his free hand for Edain Elessedil 's long knife . Hurriedly , Foraker parted them , his own sword drawn free as he turned to face Stythys . The Mwellret had suddenlyshrunk in size , withdrawing into the shadows of the cowled robes , stepping back again into darkness . " What did you do to him ? " Foraker snapped . The Mwellret shrank back further , slitted eyes gleaming in the black . Foraker wheeled abruptly . " That 's enough . We 're leaving . " " Sstay ! " the Mwellret wailed suddenly . " Sspeak with Sstythyss ! Can tell you of the Wraithss ! " " Not interested anymore , " Foraker replied , banging his sword handle against the storage room door.  | " Hss ! Musst talk with Sstythyss if you wissh the Wraithss desstroyed ! Only I know how ! Ssecretss mine ! " the creature 's voice was hard and impossibly cold now , all pretense of friendlinessgone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ! Be ssorry if you leave ! " " We 're sorry we came ! " Edain Elessedil threw back . " We do n't need your help ! " Jair was walking through the open doorway now , supported on one side by the Elven Prince and on the other by Slanter , who was muttering every step of the way . Shaking his head to clear it , the Valeman glanced back at the Mwellret , a cloaked and faceless shape squeezed deep within the shadows as Foraker took his small light from the room . " Needss my help ! " the creature said softly , scaled arm lifting . " Comess again , little friendss ! Comess back ! " Then the Dwarf sentries were closing and barring the storage room door once more , latch bolts and crossbars snapping tightly into place . Jair took a deep breath and straightened himself , shrugging free of the supporting arms . Foraker stopped him , peering closely into his eyes , grunted , and turned back down the passageway that had brought them . " Guess you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get back up into the air . " " What happened , Jair ! " Edain Elessedil wanted to know . " How did he make you do that ? " Jair shook his head . " I 'm not sure . " Still shaken , he began walking after Foraker , the Elven Prince and the Gnome on either side . " I 'm just not sure . " " Black devils ! " Slanter muttered heatedly , invoking his favoriteepithet . " They can twist you . " The Valeman nodded briefly and walked on . He wished he knew how that twisting had been done.  |p218Light  swept down about Capaal , black , misted and still . Moon and stars lay screened away from the mountain heights , and only the oil lamps of the Dwarves and watchfires of the Gnomes gave light to the shadowed dark . Frost began to form on stone and scrub , moisture freezing white as the temperaturefell lower . An unpleasant stillness lay over everything . Atop the battlements of the Dwarf fortress , Jair and Elb Forakerlooked down upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Silver River flowed . " More than five hundred years old now , " the Dwarf was explaining , his voice low and rough against the night 's silence . " Built in the time of Raybur , when our people still had kings . Built when the Second War of the Races was ended . " Jair stared wordlessly over the parapets into the darkness below , tracing the massive outline of the complex against the faint light of torches and lamps that lit its stone . There were three dams , broad bands curving back against the flow of the Silver River as it dropped downward to the gorge below . A series of locks regulated that flow , the machinery seated within and concealed by the dams and the fortress that protected both . The fortress sat astride the high dam , sprawled end to end and guardingall passageways leading in . Behind the high dam , the Cillidellanstretched away into blackness , ringed by the red watchfiresof the siege army , yet oddly opaque in the moonless shadows of this night . Between the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two small reservoirs on its passage downward from the heights . Sheer cliffs flanked both ends of the lower levels , and the only way down was across catwalks or through underground passageways that tunneled into the rock.  | " Gnomes would love to have this , " Foraker grunted , his arm sweeping over the complex . " Controls nearly the whole of the water supply for the lands west to the Rainbow Lake . In the rainy seasons , without this , there would be flooding , as there used to be before the locks and dams were built to guard against it . " He shook his head . " In a bad spring , even Culhaven would be swept away . " Jair looked about slowly , impressed with the size of the complex , awed by the effort that must have been expended in its construction . Foraker had already taken him on a tour through the inner workings of the locks and dams , explaining the machineryand the duties of those who tended it . Jair was grateful for the tour . Slanter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ravenshorn  --  maps , the Gnome had been quick to point out when they were shown him , which were entirely inaccurate . Anxious to avoid the necessity of a return to the storage room where the Mwellret was caged and determined to establish his own expertise , Slanter had agreed to make notations on the maps so that the little company would be properly advised as to the geography of the lands they must pass through during the journey that lay ahead . Edain Elessedil had excused himself and gone off on his own . When Foraker , therefore , had offered to show Jair something of the locks and dams , the Valeman had been quick to accept . Part of the reason for the tour , Jair suspected , was to take his mind off Garet Jax , who had still not returned . But that was all right , too . He preferred not to think about the missing Weapons Master . " Cliffs do n't allow the Gnomes a way down to the lower dams , " Foraker was saying , eyes turned back toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . Our ancestorsknew that well enough when they built Capaal . As long as the fortress stands , the locks and dams are safe . As long as the locks and dams are safe , the Silver River is safe . " " Except that it 's being poisoned , " Jair pointed out . The Dward nodded . " It is . But it would be worse if the whole of the Cillidellan were let loose into the gorge . The poisoning would be quicker then  --  all the way west . " " Do n't the other lands know this ? " Jair asked quietly . " They know . "  | " You would think they would be here to help you , in that case . " Foraker chuckled mirthlessly . " You would think so . But not everyone wants to believe the truth of things , you see . Some want to hide from it . " " Have any of the races agreed to aid you ? " The Dwarf shrugged . " Some . The Westland Elves are sending an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . Callahorn promises aid ; Helt and a handful of others already fight with us . Nothing from the Trolls yet  --  but the Northern territories are vast and the tribes scattered . Perhaps they will at least help us along the northern borders . " He trailed off . Jair waited a moment , then asked , " And the Southland ? " " The Southland ? " Foraker shook his head slowly . " The Southlandhas the Federation and its Coalition Council . A bunch of fools . Petty internal bickerings and power struggles occupy all of their energies . And the new Southland has no use for the peoples of the other lands . The race of Man reverts to what it was in the time of the First War . If there were a Warlock Lord alive now , I fear the Federation would be a willing follower . " Jair winced inwardly . In the First War of the Races , fought hundreds of years earlier , the Warlock Lord had subverted the race of Man and convinced it to attack the other races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still not recovered from the humiliation and bitterness of their loss . Isolationist in policy and practice , the Federation had absorbed and become spokesman for the majority of the Southland and the race of Man . " Still , Callahorn stands with you , " Jair declared quickly . " The Bordermen are a different breed . " " Even the Bordermen may not be enough . " Foraker grunted . " Even the whole of the Legion . You 've seen the gathering of tribes without . United , they are a power greater than anything we can match . And they have the aid of those black things that command them ... " He shook his head darkly . Jair 's brow furrowed . " But we have an ally of our own who can stand against the Mord Wraiths . We have Allanon . " " Yes , Allanon , " Foraker murmured , then shook his head once more . " And Brin , " Jair added . " Once they 've found the Ildatch ... "  |p221He  trailed off , the warning of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Leaves in the wind , he had said . Your sister and the Druid . Both will be lost . He shoved the whisper aside roughly . It wo n't happen like that , he promised . I 'll reach them first . I 'll find them . I 'll throw the Silver Dust into Heaven 's Well to cleanse its waters , throw the vision crystal after , and then . . . He paused uncertainly . What ? He did n't know . Something . He would do something that would keep the old man 's prophecy from coming to pass . But first there was the journey north , he reminded himself glumly . And before that , Garet Jax must return .. . Foraker was walking along the battlements once more , bearded face lowered into his chest , hands stuffed into the pocketsof the travel cloak he wore wrapped about his stocky frame . Jair caught up with him as he started down a set of broad stone steps to a lower ramp . " Can you tell me something about Garet Jax ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained lowered . " What would you have me tell you ? " Jair shook his head . " I do n't know . Something . " " Something ? " the other grunted . " Bit vague , do n't you think ? What sort of something ? " Jair thought about it a moment . " Something no one else knows . Something about him . " Foraker walked to a parapet overlooking the dark expanse of the Cillidellan , resting his elbows on the stonework as he stared out into the night . Jair stood silently beside him , waiting . " You want to understand him , do n't you ? " Foraker asked finally . The Valeman nodded slowly . " A little , at least . " The Dwarf shook his head . " I 'm not sure that it 's possible , Ohmsford . It 's like trying to understand a . . . a hawk . You see him , see what he is , what he does . You marvel at him , you wonder at his being . But you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be him to understand him . " " You seem to understand him , " Jair offered . Foraker 's fierce countenance swung sharply about to face him . " Is that what you think , Ohmsford ? That I understand him ? " He shook his head once more . " No better than I understand thep222hawk . Less , maybe . I know him because I 've spent time with him , fought with him , and trained men with him . I know him for that . I know what he is , too . But all that does n't amount to a pinch of dust when it comes to understanding . " He hesitated . " Garet Jax is like another form of life compared to you , me , or anyone else you 'd care to name . A special and singular form of life , because there 's only one . " The eyebrows lifted . " He 's magic in his way . He does things no other man could hope to do  --  or even try to do . He survives what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after time . Like the hawk , it 's instinct  --  it lets him fly way up there above the rest of us where no one can touch him . A thing apart . Understand him ? No , I could n't begin to understand him . " Jair was quiet for a moment . " He came to the Eastland because of you , though , " he said finally . " At least , he says that is why he came . So he must feel some sort of friendship for you . You must share a kinship . " " Perhaps . " The other shrugged . " But that does n't mean I understandhim . Besides , he does what he does for reasons that are all his own and not necessarily what he says they are  --  I know that much . He 's here not just because of me , Ohmsford . He 's here for other reasons as well . " He tapped Jair on the shoulder . " He 's here as much because of you as because of me , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps you do . " The Valeman hesitated , thinking . " He said he would be my protector because that was what the King of the Silver River had said he must be . " He trailed off . " Well and good . " Foraker nodded . " But do you understand him any better for knowing that ? I do not . " He paused , then looked back out across the lake . " No , his reasons are his own and the reasons are not ones he would tell to me . " Jair barely heard him . He had remembered something , and a look of surprise flitted over his face . Quickly he turned away . His mind froze . Were the reasons that Garet Jax would not tell to Foraker ones that he would tell to the Valeman ? Had n't the Weapons Master done just that in the dark , chill rain that second night out of Culhaven when the two had crouched alone beneath that ridgeline ? The memory stirred slowly to life . I want you to understand . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dream promised a test of skill greater than any I have ever faced . Ap223chance to see if I am truly the best . For me , what else is there . . . ? Jair breathed deeply the chill night air . Maybe he understood Garet Jax better than he thought . Maybe he understood him as well as anyone could . " There is one thing not many know . " Foraker turned back suddenly . Jair shoved aside his musings . " You say he found you in the Black Oaks . Ever wonder why he happened to be there ? After all , he was coming east out of Callahorn . " Jair nodded slowly . " I had n't thought about that . I guess the Black Oaks are rather out of the way for one traveling from the borderlands to the Anar . " He hesitated . " What was he doing there ? " Foraker smiled faintly . " I 'm only guessing , you understand . He 's not told me any more than you . But the lake country north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home . That was where he was born , where he grew up . Once , long ago , he had family there . Some , anyway . Has n't said anything about it for a long time , but maybe there 's still someone there . Or maybe just memories . " " A family , " Jair repeated softly , then shook his head . " Has he told you who they were ? " The Dwarf pushed himself back from the parapet . " No . Mentionedit once , that was all . But now you know something about the man no one else knows  --  except me , of course . Does that help you understand him any better ? " Jair smiled . " I do n't suppose so . " Foraker turned and together they started back across the battlements . " Did n't think it would , " the Dwarf muttered , pulling his cloak close about him as the wind caught at them beyond the shelter of the wall . " Come back inside with me , Ohmsford , and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for our hawk 's return together . " Foraker 's rough hand clapped his shoulder gently , and he hurriedafter . The night slipped away , its hours empty and lingering and clouded with dark anticipation . Mist crept down out of the heights on cat 's paws , thickening , shrouding the whole of the locks and dams , and draping Gnome and Dwarf armies alike inp224veils of damp , clinging haze until even the bright glow of the watchfires disappeared from view . Jair Ohmsford fell asleep at midnight , still awaiting the return of Garet Jax . Slumped wearily in a high-backed captain 's chair in a watch lounge while Foraker , Slanter , and Edain Elessedil talked in low voices over mugs of hot ale and a single candle lighted against the deepening gloom , he simply drifted off . One minute he was awake , listening in weary detachment to the drone of their voices , eyes closed against the light ; in the next , he was sleeping . It was almost dawn when the Elven Prince shook him awake . " Jair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his eyes and pushed himself upright . Barely visible through the gloom of fading night , the embers of a dying fire glowed softly in the little hearth across the room . Without , the patter of rain sounded on the stonework . Jair blinked . He 's back . Garet Jax . He stood up hurriedly . He was fully dressed save for his boots , and he quickly snatched them up and began to pull them on . " He came in not half an hour ago . " The Elf stood next to him , his voice strangely hushed , as if fearful he might wake someone else within the room . " Heft was with him , of course . They 've found a path north beyond the tunnels . " He paused . " But something else has happened , Jair . " The Valeman looked up expectantly . " Sometime after midnight , it began to rain and the mist to dissipate . When the light returned with dawn 's approach , the Gnomes were there , too  --  all of them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end of the high dam to the other , dozens deep , just standing there , waiting . " Jair was on his feet . " What are they up to ? " Edain Elessedil shook his head . " I do n't know . No one seems to know . But they 've been out there for hours now . The Dwarves are all awake and on the battlements . Come with me and you can see for yourself . " They hastened from the watch lounge down the maze of corridorsbeyond until they had passed through doors leading out into the courtyard that spanned the central section of the highp225dam . A chill wind blew across the Cillidellan , and the rain stung their faces as they hurried forward . It was still night , the predawn light a distant gray haze beyond the tips of the mountains east . The Dwarf defenders had taken their positions along the rampartsof the dam and fortress , cloaked and hooded against the weather , weapons in hand . The whole of Capaal lay shrouded in silence . On reaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edain took Jair up a series of stone stairs and across a line of battlements to a watchtower high above the complex . The wind seemed to grow stronger here , and the rain beat harder through the gray night . As they paused before an ironbound oak door leading into the tower , a cluster of Dwarves pushed past them and started down the stairs adjoining . Foremost of these was a fierce-looking Dwarf with flaming red hair and beard , armored in leather and chainmail . " Radhomm , the Dwarf commander ! " Edain whispered to Jair . Hurriedly , they pushed through the oak door into the tower beyond , shutting the weather behind them as they entered . A faint glow of lamplight barely penetrated the gloom within as a handful of cloaked forms seemed to materialize before them . " Humph , he 'd sleep all the time if you 'd let him ! " he heard Slanter grumble . " Well met again , Jair Ohmsford , " a deep voice greeted him , and Helt 's massive hand extended to clasp his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the night about him , implacable and unchanging as the stone of the mountains . They faced each other , and no words were spoken . Lean face intense , the Weapons Master rested his hands gently on Jair 's shoulders and within the eyes of ice there flickered a strange , unfamiliar warmth . Only for the briefest second was it there ; in the next , it was gone . The hands slipped away , and Garet Jax turned back into the gloom . The door burst open behind them , and a rain-soaked Dwarf hastened over to where Elb Foraker crouched above a pile of maps that rested on a small wooden table . They conversed in low , hushed voices ; then as swiftly as he had come , the runner was gone again.  |p226Foraker  walked over at once to Jair , the other members of the little company gathering about them . " Ohmsford , " he said quietly , " I 've just been told that the Mwellret has escaped . " There was a stunned silence . " How could that happen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . " A shape-change . " Foraker kept his eyes on Jair . " He used it to fit himself into a small ventilation shaft that circulates air to those lower levels . It happened sometime during the night . No one knows where he might be now . " Jair went cold . There was no mistaking the Dwarf 's intent in telling him this unpleasant piece of news . Even locked within that storage room , the Mwellret had been able to sense the presence of the Elven magic and to force Jair to reveal it . If he were loose .. . " This was something he could have done anytime , " Edain Elessedilpointed out . " There must be a reason that he chose to do it now . " And I could be that reason , Jair acknowledged silently . Forakerrealizes it , too . That is why he made it a point to speak first to me . Garet Jax reappeared from out of the gloom , sudden and purposeful . " We are leaving at once , " he advised . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us lies north . Whatever is to happen here , we need not be part of it . With the Gnomes gathered about the Cillidellan as they are , it should be easy enoughto ... 000000MMMMMMMMMM ! Startled , the members of the little company looked hurriedly about . A monstrous wail assailed their ears , deep and haunting as it shattered the predawn silence . It grew louder , thousands of voices giving it life , rising up against wind and rain into the mountains about Capaal . " Shades ! " Slanter cried , his rough yellow face twisting in recognition . All six broke for the door in a rush , burst through , and in seconds were clustered against the battlements without , rain and wind thrusting at them as they peered north across the choppy waters of the Cillidellan. 000000MMMMMMMMM !  |p227The  wail rose higher , one long , continuous howl that swept through the heights . All about the shoreline of the Cillidellan , the Gnomes joined in the dark chant , voices blended into one as they faced the murky lake , the air filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , shouting orders , and runners scurried from his side as he dispatched them to his captains . Everywhere there was a frenzy of activity as the garrison braced for whatever was to come . Jair 's hand moved to his tunic , searching out and finding the reassuring presence of both the Silver Dust and the vision crystal . Garet Jax snatched Slanter by his cloak and hauled him close . " What is happening here ? " There was unmistakable fear in the Gnome 's eyes . " A summons  --  asummons to the dark magic ! Once before I saw it  --  at Graymark ! " The Gnome twisted in the iron grip . " But it needs the touch of the walkers , Weapons Master ! It needs their touch ! " " Garet ! " Foraker pulled the other about roughly , pointing to the near shore of the Cillidellan , not a hundred yards from where the high dam arced away . The Weapons Master released his grip on Slanter . All eyes turned to where the Dwarf directed . From out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-cloaked figures approached , tall and hard against the coming dawn . " Mord Wraiths ! " Slanter whispered harshly . " The walkers have come ! "  |p228Down  to the Cillidellan the Mord Wraiths came , gliding to to the water 's edge almost without seeming to move . Hooded and featureless within the shadow of their cowls , they might have been ghosts of no substance but for the black-clawed fingers slipped from beneath their coverings to wrap with death grips about three gnarled gray staffs of burnished witch-wood . The wail of their Gnome believers rose all about them , shrieking into the whistle of the wind ; to those who watched from the battlements of Capaal , it seemed as if the black ones had been born of its sound . Then , without warning , the terrible wail died into silence as the Gnomes grew suddenly still . The wind 's strident shriek sounded across the empty expanse of the Cillidellan , and the lapping of the waves stirred with its passing . The foremost of the Mord Wraiths lifted his staff high , his skeletal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A strange and vibrant hush fell over the heights , and it seemed to the defenders that for an instant even the wind had gone still . Then the staff came slowly down , reaching toward the blackened waters of the lake . The other staffs joined it , witchwoodtouching and becoming one as burnished tips slipped within the waters of the Cillidellan . For an instant , nothing happened . Then the staffs exploded into lances of red fire , the flames ripping downward into the lake , burning and scorching its cool darkness . The waters shudderedand heaved , then began to boil . Gnomes shrieked in a cacophony of glee and fear , stumbling back from the shore 's edge . " It is the summons ! " Slanter cried.  |p229The  red fire burned through the murky , impenetrable blackness , down into the deepest recesses of the lake to where no light ever shone . Like a stain of blood , the light of those flames spread outward through the waters , reaching . Geysers of steam burst skyward with a violent hiss , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ramparts of the Dwarf fortress stood frozen with indecision . Something was about to happen , somethingunspeakable , and no one knew how it could be stopped . " We 've got to get out of here ! " Slanter snatched at Garet Jax urgently . There was fear in his eyes , but reason as well . " Quickly , Weapons Master ! " Abruptly the fire from the witch-wood staffs died away . The gray wood lifted from the Cillidellan , clawed hands drawing back within their robes . Yet still the waters boiled feverishly ; the reddened stain had become a deep and distant glow that shone from far beneath the surface like an eye slipped open from sleep. 000000MMMMMMMMM ! The wail of the Gnome siege army rose once more , shrill and expectant . Hands lifted and joined , stretching as the staffs of the Mord Wraiths signaled anew . Steam ripped from the lake in answer to the wail , and the whole of the Cillidellan seemed to erupt with a newfound fury . Then something huge and dark began to rise from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . But Garet Jax shook his head . " Stand fast . Helt , bring the long bows . " The Borderman disappeared back into the watchtower at once . Jair glanced after him momentarily , then turned back to the Cillidellan  --  back to the deafening wail of the Gnomes and to the black thing rising from the deep . It came swiftly now , growing in size as it neared the surface . An evil summoned by the Wraiths  --  but what manner of thing was it ? Jair swallowed against the tightening of his throat . Whateverit was , it was monstrous , its bulk seeming to fill the whole of the lake bottom as it lifted free . Slowly it began to take shape , a great and hulking thing with arms that twisted and groped . . . Then , with a thunderous surge , it broke the surface of the lake and burst free into the gray dawn . A misshapen black body wrenched clear of the confining waters and hung silhouetted forp230an instant against the light . Barrel-like in appearance , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea life and corral . Four great fin-legs propelled it as it rose , clawed and spiny . Its head was a mass of writhing tentacles that surrounded a giant beak-shaped maw lined with razor teeth . Suckers coated the insides of the tentacles , each the size of a man 's spread hand , the whole protected without by scales and spines . Immediately back of the tentacles and to either side , a pair of reddened eyes blinked coldly . Stretching as it rose , the thing was more than a hundred feet from tip to tail and forty feet across . Cries of dismay sounded from the battlements of Capaal . " A Kraken ! " Foraker said . " We are done now ! " The wail of the Gnomes had risen to a shriek that forbore all semblance of anything human . Now , with the monster 's appearanceinto the light , the wail dissipated into a battle cry that broke across the length and breadth of Capaal . Down into the waters of the lake the Kraken thundered , its black body twisting in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fortress that protected it . " It comes for us ! " Garet Jax whispered in surprise . " A thing that can not live within freshwater , a thing that comes from the ocean  --  yet here ! Brought by the dark magic ! " The gray eyes glittered coldly . " But it shall not have us , I think . Heft ! " Instantly the giant Borderman was at his side , three long bows clasped in one great hand . Garet Jax took one , left one with the Borderman , and passed the third to Edain Elessedil . Slanter pushed forward . " Listen to me ! You can not stand against this thing ! It is a monster summoned out of evil and too much even for you ! " But Garet Jax did n't seem to hear him . " Remain with the Valeman , Gnome . He is your charge now . See that he stays safe . " He went down off the watchtower , Helt and Edain Elessedil close upon his heels . Foraker hesitated only an instant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed . The Kraken surged up against the wall of the Dward citadel , its giant bulk hammering into stone and mortar with stunning force as it breached . The giant tentacles swept from the water , reaching for the Dwarves that clustered on the battlements . Dozenswere caught up , knocked from their feet into the waters of the lake , and wrapped in the suckers and spines of the thing thatp231attacked them . Shrieks and howls filled the morning air as the Dwarves died . Weapons rained down upon the black thing , but its hide protected it from harm . Steadily it cleared away the small figures who sought to hold it back , tearing at them with its whiplikearms , breaking apart the battlements behind which they sought to keep safe . Now the Gnomes joined in the attack as well , the siege army battering the gates at both ends of the high dam , scaling ladders and grappling hooks clutched in their hands as they came . Dwarf defenders rushed to the parapets , holding fast against this fresh assault . But the Gnomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being inflicted upon them , they flung themselves against the gates and walls to die . Yet there was purpose to this seeming madness . While the Dwarf defenders were thus distracted , the Kraken worked its way north until it was up against the wall where it banked closest to the gates . With a sudden lurch , it rose from the waters of the lake , fin-legs braced upon the stone of the dam where it curved into the shoreline . Massive tentacles snapped forward along the walls , suckers fastened to the gates , and the monster heaved back . With a splintering of wood and iron , crossbars snapped and locks broke apart . The gates to the citadel tumbled down , ripped from their hinges , and the army of the Gnomes poured through with a roar of triumph . On the battlements of the watchtower , Jair and Slanter viewed the struggle with growing horror . With the gates gone , the Dwarves could no longer hold back their attackers . In a matter of minutes the fortress would be overrun . Already its defenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clusters rallyingabout their captains , desperately trying to stand against the onslaught . But it was clear from where the Valeman and the Gnome stood watching that the battle was lost . " We 've got to escape while we can , boy ! " Slanter insisted , a hand gripping the other 's arm . But Jair refused to leave , still searching for his friends , almost too horrified by what was happening to do anything else . The Kraken had slipped once more into the waters of the lake , draggingits bulk back along the sea wall toward the center of the dam . In its wake , the Mord Wraiths glided to the edge of the shattered battlements , gray staffs raised in exhortation as theirp232Gnome followers surged forward . With implacable purpose , the Gnomes moved into the fortress of the Dwarves . " Slanter ! " Jair cried suddenly , pointing into the heart of the battle . High atop the ramparts of the forward wall , Helt 's giant form rose up through the smoke and dust , Elb Foraker at his side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself against the parapets , sighted downward to where the Mord Wraiths stood , slowly drew back the bowstring , and let it slip free . A shadowy blur , the long black arrow sped away to bury itself deep in the breast of the foremost Wraith . The creature straightened with a shudder , hammered back by the force of the blow . A second arrow followed close upon the first , and again the Wraith staggered back . Shrieks of dismay rose up from those closest to the black things , and for an instant the whole of the Gnome advance seemed to falter . But then the Mord Wraith steadied . One clawed hand grasped the arrows embedded within it and drew them free with effortlessease . Holding them high for all to see , the monster crushed them into splinters . Then the staff of witch-wood lifted and red fire burst from its tip . All along the battlements the fire burned , exploding into stone and defender alike . Helt and Foraker flew back as the fire reached them and disappeared in an avalanche of broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Slanter yanked him about . " You ca n't do anything to help them , boy ! " Without waiting for any argument on the matter , he began dragging Jair along the ramparts toward the stone stairway leading down . " Better start worrying about yourself ! Perhaps if we 're quick enough ... " Then they caught sight of the Kraken . It had lifted itself out of the Cillidellan midway along the sea wall where the broad courtyard joined together the fortress that guarded the ends of the high dam , its tentacles and fin-legs gripping at the stone . Once clear , with only the hindmost portion of its barreled body still submerged within the lake , it pivoted slowly to where the Dwarf defenders were attempting to escape the north fortress . Tentacles stretched across the girth of the high dam in a writhing mass ; in seconds , all passage out was blocked . " Slanter ! " Jair cried out in warning , falling back against the stairs as one giant feeler swept past his head.  |p233They  retreated back up the stairway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved back into the parapets . Spray from the monster 's tail fin that thrashed within the lake mixed with dust and shattered stone to rain down about them . Below , the Kraken 's tentacles groped and hammered about the fortress walls , clutching at anything that ventured within reach . It seemed for a moment as if any chance of escape back across the courtyard had been lost . But then the Dwarves counterattacked . They rushed from the lower levels of the fortress , the darkened stairwells , and the tunnels that ran beneath . Foremost among them was the Dwarf commander Radhomm . Red hair flying , he led his soldiers into the tangle of giant arms , cutting and hacking with a broadax . Bits and pieces of the Kraken flew in a froth of blood , reddish ichor spilling down upon the dampenedstone of the dam . But the Kraken was a monstrous thing , and the Dwarves were little more than gnats to be brushed aside . The tentacles came down , smashing the tiny creatures who swarmed about it , leaving them lifeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way for those trapped within the doomed fortress . But the Kraken swept them aside as quickly as they appeared , and they fell dying all about the monster . Finally the Kraken caught Radhomm as the Dwarf commander fought to break past . The monster swung the red-haired Dwarf high into the air , unaffected by the broadax that still flailed in stubborn determination . The Kraken lifted Radhomm ; then , with horrifying suddenness , it smashed him downward to the stone , broken , twisted , and lifeless . Slanter was pulling vainly at Jair . " Run ! " he screamed in desperation . Tentacles swept past them , hammering into the battlements and smashing the stone so that it flew in all directions . A shower of jagged fragments struck the Valeman and the Gnome as they struggled , knocking them sprawling , half burying them in debris . Shaking his head dazedly , Jair regained his feet and staggered forward against the stone balustrade . Below , the Dwarves had fallen back within the beseiged fortress , demoralized by the loss of Radhomm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edging closer now to the walls upon which Jair crouched . The Valeman started to drop back , then stopped inp234dismay . Slanter lay stunned at his feet , blood oozing from a deep cut in his head . Then far below , seemingly from out of nowhere , Garet Jax appeared . Lean and black against the gray light of the dawn , he darted swiftly from the shelter of the battlements on the sea wall , a short spear gripped in his hands . Jair cried out as he saw him  --  a sudden , wild cry  --  but the sound was lost in the wail of the wind and the screams of battle . Across the blood-soaked length of the high dam the Weapons Master raced , a small and agile figure  --  not away from the deadly tentacles of the Kraken , but directly into them . Weaving and dodging like a shadow withoutsubstance , he broke for the monster 's gaping maw . The tentacleshammered down , swatting at him , missing him , sliding past him , far too slow for anyone so impossibly quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the hooked beak , the Weapons Master leaped , against the very jaws of the beast . He struck with stunning swiftness , the short spear burying itself deep within the soft tissue of the open maw . Instantly , the tentacles collapsed , the giant body lurching . But Garet Jax was already moving , spinning sidewaysand diving clear of the trap that sought to snare him . On his feet once more , the Weapons Master caught up a new weapon , this one a lance fixed with an iron pike , the haft still clutched in the lifeless hands of its owner . With a quick scooping motion , Garet Jax had wrenched it free . Too late , the Kraken caught sight once more of this dangerous attacker , barely two yards from one lidded eye . The iron-tipped lance thrust upward at the unprotected eye , piercing through skin , blood , and bone into the brain beyond . The stricken Kraken wrenched backward in obvious distress , fin-legs churning madly . Stone ramparts shattered all about it as it sought to regain the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lance embedded within the monster 's brain , refusing to release it , grinding it deeper and deeper as he waited for the life force to expend itself . But the Kraken was impossibly strong . Heaving upward , it lifted free of the high dam , then fell ponderouslyinto the Cillidellan and dove from sight . Hands still fixed upon the haft of the lance , Garet Jax was carried with it . Jair stumbled back against the shattered balustrade in stunned disbelief , his cry of anger dying soundlessly in his throat . Below ,  |p235the  high dam lay clear again and the Dwarf defenders trapped within broke from their prison for the safety of the south watch . Then Slanter was next to him once more , staggering back to his feet . Blood covered the wizened yellow face , but the Gnome brushed it aside wordlessly and yanked the Valeman down the stairs after him . Stumbling and falling , they gained the courtyard and started across in the direction taken by the fleeing Dwarves . But already they were too late . Gnome Hunters had appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and screaming , a mass of armored , blood-soaked forms , they poured across the crest of the high dam and streamed down into the court . Slanter took one quick look back and abruptly wheeled Jair into one of the dark stairwells . They raced down several flights of lamp-lighted stairs , deep into the shadowed dark of the lower levels that led to the inner workings of the locks . Above , the sounds of pursuit began to fade . When the stairs ended , they found themselves in a dimly lighted corridor that disappeared down the length of the dam . Slanter hesitated , then turned north , pulling Jair after him . " Slanter ! " the Valeman howled , struggling to slow the Gnome . " This leads back the way we 've come  --  away from the Dwarves ! " " Gnomes will be going the other way , too ! " Slanter snapped . " Wo n't be hunting Dwarves or anybody else this way , will they ! Now , run ! " They ran into the gloom , stumbling wearily along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , distant and faint against the steady grinding of the machinery and the low rush of the waters of the Cillidellan . Jair 's mind spun with the shock of what had befallen them . The little company from Culhavenwas no more  --  Helt and Foraker struck down by the walkers , Garet Jax carried away by the Kraken , and Edain Elessedil disappeared . Only Slanter and he were left  --  and they were running for their lives . Capaal was gone , fallen to the Gnomes . The locks and dams that regulated the flow of the Silver River west into the homeland of the Dwarves were in the hands of their most implacable enemy . Everything was lost . His lungs tightened with the strain of running , and his breathing was harsh and labored in his ears . Tears stung his eyes , and his mouth was dry with bitterness and anger . What was he to do now ? How was he to reach Brin ? He could never find herp236before she stepped down into the Maelmord and was forever lost . How was he to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs went out from under him , knocked away by something he had n't seen , and he went sprawling into the darkness . Ahead , Slanter ran on , unheeding , a dim shadow in the darkness of the tunnel . Hurriedly , Jair scrambled back to his feet . Slanter was getting too far ahead of him . Then an arm shot out of the darkness and a hand clamped across his mouth , rough and scaled , sealing away his breath . A second arm encircled his body , hard as iron , and he was dragged back into the shadows of an open door . " Sstay , little peopless , " a voice hissed . " Friendss , we of magicss . Friendss ! " Jair 's voice was a soundless scream in his mind . It was midmorning when Slanter pulled himself clear of the Dwarf escape tunnel , exiting through a thick mass of scrub that concealed the hidden entrance , there to stand alone upon the windswept heights of the mountains north of Capaal . Gray , hazy light filtered down out of skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night still lingered in the mountain rock . The Gnome glanced about cautiously , then he hunched down against the scrub and moved forward to where the slope dropped away into the gorge . Far below , the locks and dams of Capaal were swarming with Gnomes . All across the broad bands of stone block , about the battlements and ramparts of the fortress , and deep within the inner workings of the complex , the Gnome Hunters scurried like ants about the business of maintaining their hill . Well , this was the way it had to end , Slanter thought . He shook his rough yellow face in silent admonition . No one could stand against the walkers . Capaal was theirs now . The siege was done . He stood up slowly , eyes still fixed on the scene below . There was little danger of being discovered this high up . The Gnomes were all within the fortress and what remained of the Dwarf army had fled south to Culhaven . Nothing was left for him to do but to go his own way . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted all along.  |p237Yet  he stood there , his mind adrift with unanswered questions . He still did not know what had become of Jair Ohmsford . One minute the Valeman had been right behind him ; the next he had vanished just like that . Slanter had looked for him , of course ; but there had n't been a trace . So at last the Gnome had gone on alone  --  because , after all , what else could he do ? " Boy was too much trouble anyway ! " he muttered irritably . But his words lacked conviction somehow . He sighed , glanced upward into the graying skies , and turned slowly away . With the Valeman gone and the rest of the little company dead or scattered , the journey to Heaven 's Well was finished . Just as well , of course . It was a stupid , impossible quest from the beginning . He had told them so time and again  --  all of them . They had no idea what they were up against ; they had no idea of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had failed . The frown on his rough face deepened . Nevertheless , he did n't like not knowing what had happened to the boy . He slipped back past the scrub guarding the hidden entrance to the tunnel and climbed to a rocky projection overlooking the Eastland and giving view to its sweep west . At least , he had been smart enough to plan his own escape , he thought smugly . But that was because he was a survivor , and survivors always took time to plan for an escape  --  except for the crazed ones like Garet Jax . Slanter 's frown turned to a faint smile . He had learned long ago not to risk himself unnecessarily where there was no reason for it . He had learned long ago to keep one eye open for the quickest way out of any place into which he ventured . So when the Dwarf had been kind enough to provide him with maps showing the underground tunnels that would take them north behind the siege army , he had been quick to study them . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the rest of them had n't been so foolish .. . The wind blew against his face , harsh and bitter as it came out of the mountain rock . Far north and west , the forests of the Anar spread away into patches of autumn color , dampened by mist and rain . That was the way for him , he thought grimly . Back to the borderlands , to some semblance of sanity and peace , where his old life could be regained and all of this forgotten . He was free again and he could now go where he wished . A week , tenp238days at the outside , and the Eastland and the war that ravagedit would be left behind . He scuffed his boot against the rock . " That boy had sand , though , " he said quietly , his thoughts straying yet . Undecided , he stared out into the rain.  |p239Late  in the afternoon of the day that marked the disappearance of Paranor from the world of men , the whole of Callahorn from the Streleheim south to the Rainbow Lake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the borderlands , swept across forest and grassland , and over the Dragon 's Teeth and the Runne , falling at last across the broad expanse of the Rabb Plains . It was there that it caught up with Allanon , Brin , and Rone Leah as they journeyed eastward toward the Anar . They camped that night , exposed to the downpour and huddiedwithin their sodden cloaks , beneath the sparse shelter of an oak broken and ravaged by years of seasons passing . Empty and barren , the Rabb stretched away on all sides as the storms thundered overhead , the glare of the lightning revealing in vivid flashes the starkness of the plain . No other life could be found on its cracked and windswept surface ; they were all alone . They might have pushed on that night , ridden east until dawn , and thereby gained the Anar before stopping to take their rest . Butthe Druid saw that the highlander and the Valegirl were exhaustedand thought it better not to press . So they stayed that night upon the Rabb and rode on again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gray and rain-filled , the sun 's light a faint and hazy glow behind the storm clouds that blanketed the autumn skies . They rode east across the plains until they reached the banks of the Rabb River , then turned south . Where the river branched west out of its main channel , they crossed at a narrows close to the forest 's edge and continued south until daylight had slipped into a murky , sodden dusk . They spent a second night unsheltered upon the Rabb , crouched within cloaks and hoods , with the rain a constant , an/noying drizzle that drenched them to the bone and kept them from sleep . The chill of the season settled in about them . While neither cold nor sleeplessness had an apparent effect upon the Druid , it wore with singular perseverance on the stamina of the girl and the highlander . On Brin , particularly , it began to take its toll . Yet at dawn of the following day , she was ready to travel once more , her determination as hard as iron , reforged out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of the night to keep herself sane . The rains that had followed them since their departure out of the Dragon 's Teeth were gone , turned now to a soft , feathery mist . The skies were clearing into wisps of whitenedclouds as the sunlight began to slip above the forestline . The appearance of the sun rekindled in the Valegirl a strength of mind and body that the rains and the dark had done much to erode , and she fought valiantly to ignore the exhaustion that seeped through her . Back astride her horse , she turned gratefully toward the warmth of the still hazy sunlight and watched as it crept steadily out of the east . But exhaustion was not so easily dispatched , she found . Though the day brightened as they traveled on , a weariness still persisted deep within , besieging her with doubts and fears that would not fade . Faceless demons darted in their shadows  --  darted from her mind into the forest they rode beside , laughing and taunting . There were eyes upon her . As it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being watched , sometimesfrom far away through eyes that were not bound by any distance , sometimes from eyes that seemed very close . And again there was that insidious premonition . It had come to her first in the rocks and shadows of the Dragon 's Teeth , following after her , teasing her relentlessly , warning her that she and those she traveled with played a game with death they could not win . She had thought it lost after Paranor , for they had escaped the Druid 's Keep alive and safe . Yet now it was back again , reborn in the gray and wet of the last two days , a familiar and haunting demon of her mind . It was evil , and though she sought to drive it from her thoughts with determination and a savage anger , still it would not stay gone . The hours drifted aimlessly away in the course of the third morning 's travel , and Brin Ohmsford 's determination graduallyp241began to drift with them . The drifting manifested itself first as an inexplicable sense of aloneness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even recognize  --  theValegirl began to withdraw into herself . It was done in self-defense to begin with , a withdrawing from the thing that sought to ravage her with its viperous warnings and insidious teasings . Walls came up , windows and doors slammed , and within the shelter of her mind she sought to close the thing out . But Allanon and Rone were closed out as well , and somehow she could not find a way to bring them back in . She was alone , a prisoner within her own self , chained in irons of her own forging . A subtle change began to overtake her . Slowly , inexorably , she began to believe herself alone . Allanon had never been close , a distant and forbidding figure even under the most favorable circumstances , a stranger for whom she could feel pity and for whom she could sense an odd kinship  --  yet a stranger nevertheless , impervious and forbidding . It had been different with Rone Leah , of course ; but the highlander had changed . From her friend and companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Druid . The Sword of Leah had wrought that change , giving to Rone Leah power that made him in his own mind equal to anything that sought to stand against him . Magic , born of the dark waters of the Hadeshorn and the black sorcery of Allanon , had subverted him . The sense of intimacy that had bound them each to the other was gone . It was the Druid to whom Rone was bound now and to whom the kinship belonged . But the drifting of Brin 's determination grew quickly beyond her sense of aloneness . It became a feeling that somehow , in some way , she had lost her purpose in this quest . It was n't gone entirely , she knew  --  yet it had strayed . Once that purpose had been clear and certain ; she was to travel into the Eastland , through the Anar and the Ravenshorn , to the edge of the pit they called the Maelmord and there descend into that pit 's blackenedmaw to destroy the book of dark magic , the Ildatch . That had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the dark , cold , and discomfort of their travels , the urgency of that purpose had slipped from her until it now seemed distant and tenuous . Allanon and Rone were strong and certain  --  twin irons against the shadows that would stop them . What need had they of her ?  |p242Could  they not act as well as she in this quest , despite the Druid 's words ? Somehow she felt that they could , that she was not the important member of this company , but almost a burden , a thing not needed , her usefulness misjudged . She tried telling herself that this was not true . But somehow it was ; her presence was a mistake . She sensed it , and in sensing it grew even more alone . Midday came and went , and the afternoon wore on . The mist of early morning was gone now , and the day had become bright with sunlight . Bits of color reappeared on the barren plains . The cracked and ravaged earth turned slowly once again to grassland . Brin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By nightfall , the riders had reached Storlock , the community of Gnome Healers . An aged , famous village , it was little more than a gathering of modest stone and timber dwellings , settled within the fringe of the woods . It was here that Wil Ohmsford had studied and trained for the profession that he had always sought to follow . Here Allanon had come to find him so that he might accompany the Druid on his journey south to find the Chosen Amberle in the quest to preserve the Ellcrys tree and the Elven race  --  a journey that ended with the infusion of the Elfstone magic into Brin 's father , thereby bequeathing to her the power of the wishsong . It had been more than twenty years ago , Brin thought in somber , almost bitter reflection . That was how the madness had begun  --  with the coming of Allanon . For the Ohmsfords , that was how it always began . They rode through the tranquil , sleepy village , drawing to a halt behind a large , broad-backed building arrive . Silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more took Brin , Rone , and Allanon inside , down dark and shadowed hallways to separate rooms . Hot baths waited , clean clothes and food , and beds with fresh linens . The Stors spoke no words as they went about the task of caring for their guests . Like ghosts , they lingered for a few minutes and then were gone . Alone in her room , Brin bathed , changed , and ate her meal , lost in the weariness of her body and the solitude of her mind . Nightfall slipped down across the forestland , and shadows passed over the curtained windows , the light of day fading into dusk . The Valegirl watched its passing with sleepy , languorous un/concern , given over to the pleasure of comforts she had not enjoyed since leaving the Vale . For a time , she could almost pretend that she was back again . But when the evening deepened , there came a knock upon the door and a white-robed Stor beckoned for her to follow . She went without argument . She knew without asking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the hallway , Rone Leah seated beside him at a small table on which an oil lamp burned to cast away the night 's shadow . Wordlessly , the Druid beckoned to a third chair , and the Valegirl moved to occupy it . The Stor who had brought her waited until she was seated , then turned and glided from the room , closing the door softly behind him as he left . The three companions faced one another in silence . Allanon shifted in his chair , dark face hard and fixed , eyes lost in worlds that the Valegirl and the highlander could not see . He looked old this night , Brin thought and wondered that it could be so . No one had known Allanon to age , save for her father , and that had come about just before the Druid disappeared from the Four Lands twenty years earlier . Yet now she saw it , too . He had aged beyond what he had looked when first he had come to the Vale to seek her out . His long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face more lined and time-ravaged , his look more bent and rough . Time was working against the Druid , even as it worked against them all . The black eyes swept up to meet her own . " I would tell you now of Bremen , " he rumbled softly , and the gnarled hands folded before him . " Long ago , in the time of the Councils of the Druids at Paranor , in the time between the Wars of the Races , it was Bremen who saw the truth about the coming of the magic . Brona , who was to become the Warlock Lord , had unlocked the secrets years before and fallen prey to their power . Consumed by what he had hoped to master , the rebel Druid became a slave . After the First War of the Races , the Council believed him destroyed , yet Bremen saw that it was not so . Brona lived , preserved by the magic , driven by its force and its need . The sciences of the old world were gone , lost in the holocaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic of a world older still , a worldp244in which only Eerie creatures had existed . It was this magic , Bremen saw , that would preserve or destroy the new world of men . " Thus Bremen defied the Council as Brona had before him  --  yet with greater care for what he was about  --  and began to learn for himself the secrets of the power that the rebel Druid had unlocked . Prepared for the Warlock Lord 's eventual return , he saved himself when all the other Druids were destroyed . It became his mission , the sole and fixed purpose of his life , to regain the power that the evil one had let loose , to recapture it and seal it away where it could not again be tampered with . No easy task  --  yet a task to which he pledged himself . The Druids had unlocked the magic ; now , as the last of those Druids , it was left to him to lock it away once more . " Allanon paused . " He chose to do this through the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elven magic that could destroy the Warlock Lord and the Bearers of the Skull that served him . In the darkest hour of the Second War of the Races , with the whole of the Four Lands threatened by the armies of the evil one , Bremen forged , from magic and from the skills he had acquired and the knowledge he had gained , the fabled Sword . He gave it to the Elven King Jerle Shannara . With that Sword , the King would face in battle the rebel Druid and see him destroyed . " As you know , however , Jerle Shannara failed . Unable fully to master the power of the Sword , he let the Warlock Lord escape . Though the battle was won and the armies of the evil one driven forth , still Brona lived . Years would pass before he could return , but return he would . Bremen knew that he would not be there to face Brona again . Yet his pledge had been given , and Bremen would never forsake a promise . " The Druid 's voice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of intense pain within the black , impenetrable eyes . " He did three things , then . He chose me to be his son , the flesh and blood offspring of the Druid line who would walk upon the Four Lands until the time of the Dark Lord 's return . He gave added life to himself first and to me later through the sleep that preserves so that , for as long as might be necessary , a Druid would stand as protector of mankind against the Warlock Lord . And finally , he did one thing more . When the time of his passingp245was at hand and he could not make himself lee go , he used the magic in one last , terrible evocation . He bound his spirit to this world in which his body could not stay , so that he could reach beyond life 's end to see fulfillment of the pledge that he had made . " Gnarled hands tightened into fists . " He bound himself , spirit out of flesh , to me ! He used the magic to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world of dark where past and future joined , where summons could be had when the need was there . That was what he chose for himself , a lost and hopelessbeing , never to be freed until it was done , until both had passed ... " He stopped suddenly , as if his words had brought him farther than he wished to go . In that instant , Brin caught sight of what had been hidden from her before  --  a quick , elusive glimpse of the secret that the Druid had withheld from her in the Valley of Shale when Bremen had risen from the Hadeshorn and spokenof what was to be , and which gave substance to the whisperingsof her premonition . " I thought it done once , " Allanon went on , brushing past the sudden pause . " I thought it done when Shea Ohmsford destroyedthe Warlock Lord  --  when the Valeman unlocked the secret of the Sword of Shannara and made himself its master . But I was wrong . The dark magic did not die with the Warlock Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be . It survived , kept safe within the pages of the Ildatch , secreted away within the bowels of the Maelmord to await new discoverers . And , finally , the discoverers came . " " And became the Mord Wraiths , " Rone Leah finished . " Made slaves to the dark magic as had been the Warlock Lord and the Skull Bearers in old days . Thinking to be master , they became only slaves . " But what is the secret that you hide ? Brin whispered in her mind , still waiting to hear it told . Speak now of that ! " Then Bremen can not be freed from his exile within the Hadeshornuntil the book of the Ildatch is destroyed  --  and the magic with it ? " Rone was too caught up in the history of the tale to see what Brin saw . " He is pledged to that destruction , Prince of Leah , " Allanon whispered.  |p246And  you . And you . Brin 's mind raced . " All of the dark magic gone from the land ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem possible . Not after so many years of its being  --  of wars fought because of it , of lives ex-pended . " The Druid looked away . " That age ends , highlander . That age must pass . " There was a long silence then , a hushed stillness that filled the night shadows about the flame of the oil lamp and crowded close about the three who huddled there . Wrapped by it , they thought their separate thoughts , eyes slipping past one another 's faces to shield what whispered within . Strangers joined in commoncause but without understanding , thought Brin . We strive for a common good , yet the bond is curiously weak .. . " Can we succeed in this , Allanon ? " Rone Leah asked suddenly . His wind-burned face turned toward the Druid . " Have we strength enough to destroy this book and its dark magic ? " The Druid did not answer for a moment . His eyes flickered with hidden knowledge , elusive and quick . Then he said quietly , " Brin Ohmsford has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him and shook her head slowly . Her smile twisted with irony . " Hope and no hope . Savior and destroyer . Remember the words , Allanon ? Your father spoke them of me . " Allanon said nothing . He simply sat there , dark eyes staring into her own . " What else did he tell you , Allanon ? " she asked him quietly . " What else ? " There was a long pause . " That I shall not see him again in this world . " The silence deepened . She was close now to the secret the Druid kept hidden , she realized . Rone Leah stirred uneasily in his chair , eyes shifting to find those of the Valegirl . There was uncertainty in those eyes , Brin saw . Rone did not want to know any more . She looked away . It was she who was the hope , and she who must know . " Was there more ? " she said . Slowly Allanon straightened , dark robes wrapping close about him , and on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is an Ohmsford obsession with knowing the truth of allp247that is , " he replied . " Not a one of you has ever been content with less . " " What did Bremen say ? " she pressed . The smile died away . " He said , Brin Ohmsford , that when I go from the Four Lands this time , I shall not come again . " Valegirl and highlander stared at him in shocked disbelief . As certain as the cycle of the seasons was the return of Allanon to the Four Lands when the danger of the dark magic threatened the races . There had never been a time in memory when he had not come . " I do n't believe you , Druid ! " Rone insisted heatedly , unable to think of anything else to say , a trace of outrage in his voice . Allanon shook his head slowly . " The age passes , Prince of Leah . I must pass with it . " Brin swallowed against the tightness in her throat . " When .. . when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , Brin , " the Druid finished gently . " When it is time . " Then he rose , a tall and weathered form as black as night and as steady as its coming . The great , gnarled hands reached out across the table . Without fully understanding why , the Valegirl and the highlander reached to clasp them in their own , joining for just an instant the three as one . The Druid 's nod was brief and somehow final . " Tomorrow we ride east into the Anar  --  east until our journey is done . Go now and sleep . Be at peace . " The great hands released their own and dropped away . " Go , " he said softly . With a quick , uncertain glance at each other , Brin and Rone stood up and walked from the room . All the way out , they could feel the dark gaze following after . They walked in silence down the hallway beyond . The sound of voices , distant and fragmented , wafted through the shadows of the empty hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thick with the smell of herbs and medicines , and they breathed in the aromas , distracted from their thoughts . When they reached the doors to their sleeping rooms , they stopped and stood together , not touching or looking at eachp248other , sharing without speaking the impact of what they had been told . It can not be true , Brin thought , stunned . It can not . Rone turned to face her then , and his hands reached down to take hers . For the first time since their departure from Hadeshornand the Valley of Shale , she felt close to him again . " What he told us , Brin ... what he said about not returning ... " The highlander shook his head . " That was the reason we went to Paranor and he sealed away the Keep . He knew he would not be coming back ... " " Rone , " she said quickly and put her finger to his lips . " I know . It 's just that I can not believe it . " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am afraid , Brin , " he said finally , his voice a whisper . She nodded without speaking , then wrapped her arms about him and held him close . Then she stepped back again , kissed him lightly on the mouth and disappeared into her room . Slowly , wearily Allanon turned from the closed door and seated himself once more at the small table . Eyes shifting from the flame of the oil lamp , he stared fixedly into the shadows beyond , his thoughts drifting . Once he would not have felt the need to reveal the secrets that were his . He would have disdained to do so . He was the keeper of the trust , after all ; he was the last of the Druids and the power that had once been theirs belongednow to him . He had no need to confide in others . It had been so with Shea Ohmsford . Much of the truth had been kept from Shea , left hidden for the little Valeman to discoveron his own . It had been so as well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quest of the Bloodfire . Yet Allanon 's resolve for secrecy , for deliberate and iron-willed refusal to tell to any  --  even those closest  --  all that he knew , had somehow weakened through the years gone past . Perhaps it was the aging , come upon him at last , or the inexorable passing of time that weighed so heavily upon him . Perhaps it was simply the need to share what he carried with some other living soul . Perhaps.  |p249He  rose again from the table , another of night 's shadows floatingbeyond the reach of the light . A sudden breath of air , and the oil lamp went dark . He had told so much more to the Valegirl and the highlander than to any of the others . And still he had not told them all.  |p250Dawn  broke over the Eastland and the forests of the Anar , and the journey of the three who had come from Shady Vale resumed . Supplied with fresh provisions by the Healers of Storlock , they rode east out of the village into the woodlands beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sad-faced and voiceless , gathered at the stables behind the Centerto lift their arms in farewell . Within minutes , the three had disappeared into the trees , gone as silently and as enigmatically as they had come . It was the kind of autumn day fond memories conjure up of a milder season 's passing when winter snows lie deep about . It was warm and sun-filled , with the colors of the forest trees radiantand sprinkled with soft beams of light and the morning smells sweet and pleasant . Dark and chill as the days gone by had been in the wake of the passing of the late-year storms , this day was light and comforting with its dazzling blue skies and sunshine . The promise of the day was lost , however , to Brin Ohmsford and Rone Leah . Haunted by Allanon 's dark revelation and by a tense expectation of what lay ahead , neither could share much of the warmth that the day had to offer . Separate and withdrawn , each within a dark covering of private emotions and secretive thoughts , Valegirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of the great , dark trees , feeling only the cold that lay buried within themselves . " Our path hereafter will be a treacherous one , " Allanon had told them as they gathered that morning before the stables where their horses had been tended , his voice low and strangely gentle . " All across the Eastland and through the forests of the Anar , the Wraiths will be watching for us . They know that we come ; Par/anor removed all question of that . They know as well that they must stop us before we reach the Maelmord . Gnomes will seek us , and where they do not , others who obey the walkers will . No path east into the Ravenshorn will be safe for us . " His hands had come up then to rest upon their shoulders , drawing them close . " Still , we are but three and not so easily found . The Wraiths and their Gnome eyes will look two ways for our approach  --  north above the Rabb River and south out of Culhaven . Safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise man would choose . We will choose neither , therefore . Instead , we will pass where it is most dangerous  --  notonly to us , but to them as well . We will pass directly east into the central Anar  --  through the Wolfsktaag , Darklin Reach , and Olden Moor . Older magics than theirs dwell within those regions  --  magics that they will be hesitant to challenge . The Wolfsktaag are forbidden to the Gnomes , and they will not enter , even though the Wraiths command it . There are things there more dangerous than the Gnomes we seek to avoid , but most lie dormant . If we are quick and cautious , we should pass through unharmed . Darklin Reach and the Moor are the haunts of other magics yet , but there perhaps we shall find some more friendly to our cause than to theirs ... " They rode through the western fringe of the central Anar up into the high ground that formed the doorstep to the rugged , forested humps of the Wolfsktaag . As they traveled , they searched past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark things that lay hidden there . By midday , they had reached the Pass of Jade and begun a long , circuitous climb along its southern slope , where trees and scrub hid them from view as they walked their horses in the deep shadow . Midafternoonfound them well east of the pass , wending their way upward toward the high peaks . Timber and rock stretched dark and silent about them as the daylight began to wane . By nightfall , they were deep within the mountains . In the trees through which they passed , the shadows slipped now like living things . All the while they searched , yet found no sign of other life and felt themselves to be alone . It was curious and somehow frightening that they could be so alone , Brin thought as the dusk settled into the mountains and the day came to an end . She should sense at least a touch of lifep252other than their own , yet it was as if these peaks and forests had been stripped . There were no birds within these trees , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only the silence , deep and pervasive  --  the silence , itself become a living thing in the absence of all other life . Allanon brought them to a halt in the shelter of a grove of rough and splintering hickory to set their camp . When provisions were sorted , the horses tended , and the camp at ready , the Druid called them to him , ordered that no fire be lighted , and stalked off into the trees with a quick word of farewell . Valegirl and highlander stared after him wordlessly until he was out of sight , then sat down to consume a cold meal of bread , cheese , and dried fruit . They ate in darkness , not speaking , watching the shadows about them for the life that never seemed to come . Overhead , the night sky brightened with a great scattering of stars . " Where do you think he has gone this night ? " Rone Leah wondered after a time . He spoke almost as if he were asking himself the question . Brin shook her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just like a shadow , is n't he ? Shifts with every change of sun and moon , appears , and then he 's gone again  --  always for reasons all his own . He would n't share those reasons with us , of course . Not with mere humans like us . " He sighed and set aside his plate . " Except that I guess we 're not mere humans anymore , are we ? " Brin toyed with the bit of bread and cheese that remained on her own plate . " No , " she answered softly . " Well , no matter . We are who we always were , nevertheless . " He paused , as if wondering how sure of that he really was . Then he leaned forward . " It 's odd , but I do n't feel the same way about him now that I did before . I 've been thinking about it all day . I still do n't trust him entirely . I ca n't . He knows too much that I do n't . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , I think , in the best way that he can . " He stopped , waiting for Brin to agree with him , but the Valegirlstayed silent , eyes turned away . " Brin , what 's troubling you ? " he asked finally . She looked at him and shook her head . " I 'm not sure . "  | " Is it what he told us last night  --  that we would n't see him again after this ? " " That , yes . But it 's more than that . " He hesitated . " Maybe you 're just ... " " Something is wrong , " she cut him short , and her eyes locked on his . " What ? " " Something is wrong . " She said it slowly , carefully . " With him , with you , with this whole journey  --  but most especially with me . " Rone stared at her . " I do n't understand . " " I do n't understand either . I just feel it . " She pulled her cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've felt it for days  --  ever since the shade of Bremen appeared in the Hadeshorn , and we destroyed that Wraith . I feel something bad coming . . . something terrible . And I do n't know what it is . I feel , too , that I 'm being watched ; all the time I 'm being watched , but there is never anything there . I feel , worst of all , that I 'm being ... pulled away from myself , from you and Allanon . Everything is changing from what it was when we started out at Shady Vale . It 's all different , somehow . " The highlander did n't say anything for a moment . " I suppose it 's because of what 's happened to us , Brin . The Hadeshorn , Paranor  --  Allanon telling us what the shade of Bremen told to him . It had to change us . And we 've been away from the Vale and the highlands for many days now , from everything familiar and comfortable . That has to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jair , " she said quietly . " And your parents . " " But Jair most of all , " she insisted , as if searching for a reason for this . Then she shook her head . " No , it 's not that . It 's something else , something besides what 's happened with Allanon and missing home and family and . . . That 's too easy , Rone . I can feel it , deep down within me . Something that ... " She trailed off , her dark eyes uncertain . She looked away . " I wish I had Jair here with me now  --  just for a few moments . I think he would know what was wrong . We 're so close that way ... " She caught herself , then laughed softly . " Is n't that silly ?  |p254Wishing  for something like that when it would probably mean nothing ? " " I miss him , too . " The highlander tried a quick smile . " At least he might take our minds off our own problems . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped , realizing what he had said , then shrugged away his discomfort . " Anyway , there 's probably nothing wrong  --  not really . If there was , Allanon would sense it , would n't he ? After all , he seems to sense everything else . " Brin was a long time responding . " I wonder if that is still so , " she said finally . " I wonder if he still can . " They were silent then , neither looking back at the other as they stared fixedly into the dark and pondered their separate thoughts . As the minutes slipped away , the stillness of the mountainnight seemed to press in about them , anxious to wrap them in the blanket of its stark , empty solitude . It seemed more certain with the passing of each moment that some sound must break the spell , the distant cry of a living creature , the small shifting of forest wood or mountain rock , or the rustle of leaf or insect 's buzz . But nothing did . There was only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Brin said suddenly . Rone Leah shook his head . " We travel a fixed course , Brin . There is no drifting in that . " She looked over at him . " I wish I had listened to you and had never come . " The highlander stared at her in shock . The beautiful , dusky face stayed turned toward his own . In the girl 's black eyes there was a mix of weariness and doubt that bordered too closely on fear . For just an instant he had the unpleasant sensation that the girl who sat across from him was not Brin Ohmsford . " I will protect you , " he said softly , urgently . " I promise . " She smiled then , a faint , uneven smile that flickered and was gone . Gently her hands reached out to touch his own . " I believe that , " she whispered in reply . But somewhere deep inside , she found herself wondering if he really could . It was nearly midnight when Allanon returned to the campsite , stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the Wolfsktaag . Moonlight slipped through the boughsp255overhead in thin streamers of silver and cast the whole of the night in eerie brightness . Wrapped within their blankets , Rone and Brin lay sleeping . Across the broad , forested sweep of the mountains , all was still . It was as if he alone kept watch . The Druid paused several dozen feet from where his charges slept . He had walked to be alone , to think , and to ponder the certainty of what was to be . How unexpected the words of Bremenhad been when the shade had spoken them  --  how strangely unexpected . They should not have been , of course . He had known what must be from the beginning . Yet there was always the feeling that somehow it might be changed . He was a Druid , and all things were possible . His black eyes shifted across the mountain range . The yesterdaysof his life were far away , the struggles he had weathered and the roads he had walked down to reach this moment . The tomorrows seemed distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . The tomorrows were right before him . So much had been accomplished , he mused . But not enough . He turned and looked down at the sleeping Valegirl . She was the one upon whom everything would depend . She would not believe that , of course , or the truth about the power of the wishsong , for she chose to see the Elven magic in human terms , and the magic had never been human . He had shown her what it could be  --  just a glimpse of the limits to which it could be taken , for she could stand no more , he sensed . She was a child in her understanding of the magic and her coming of age would be difficult . More difficult , he knew , because he could not help her . His long arms wrapped tightly within the black robes . Could he not help her ? There it was again . He smiled darkly . That decision that he should never reveal all , only so much as he felt necessary  --  that decision that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , truth was best learned by the one who would use it . He could tell her , of course  --  or at least he could try to tell her . Her father would have said that he should tell her , for Wil Ohmsford had believed the same about the Elven girl Amberle . But the decision was not Wil Ohmsford 's to make . It was his own . It was always his own . A touch of bitterness twisted his mouth . Gone were the Councilsat Paranor when many voices and many minds had joinedp256in finding solutions to the problems of mankind . The Druids , the wise men of old , were no more . The histories and Paranor and all the hopes and dreams they had once inspired were lost , and only he remained . All of the problems of mankind were now his , as they always had been his and would continue to be his for as long as he lived . That decision , too , had been his to make . He had made it when he had chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would there be another to make the same decision when he was gone ? Alone , uncertain , he stood at the edge of the forest shadows and looked down at Brin Ohmsford . They rode east again at daybreak . It was another brilliant , sunfilledautumn day  --  warm , sweet , and alive with dreams of what could be . As night fled westward from the Wolfsktaag , the sun lifted out of the eastern horizon , slipping from the forestline in golden streamers that stretched and spread to the darkest corners of the land and chased the gloom before them . Even within the vast and empty solitude of the forbidden mountains there was a feeling of comfort and peace . Brin thought of home . How beautiful the Vale would be on a day such as this one , she thought to herself as she walked her horse along the ridgeline and felt the sun 's warmth upon her face . Even here the colors of the season spread in riotous disarray against a backdrop of moss and groundcover still green with summer 's touch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their mix . In the Vale , the villagers would be awake now , about to begin their day 's work . Breakfast would be underway , the succulent aroma of the foods that were cooking escaping through windows thrown wide to catch the warmth of the day . Later , when the morning chores were done , the village families would gather for stories and games on an afternoon that too seldom came this time of year , anxious to take advantage of its ease and recapture for at least a brief time the memory of the summer gone . I wish I were there to share it , she thought . I wish I were home . The morning slipped quickly away , its passing lost in the warmth of the sun and the memories and the dreams . Ridgelines and mountain slopes came and went , and ahead the deep forestsp257of the lowlands beyond the Wolfsktaag began to appear in brief glimpses through the humped peaks . By noon , the bulk of the range was behind them , and they were starting down . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It began as sound long before it could be seen  --  a deep , penetratingroar from beyond a wooded ridge that broke high and rugged against the sweep of the Eastland sky . Like an invisible wave , it surged toward them , a low and sullen rumble that shook the rutted earth with the force of its passing . Then the wind seemed to catch it , magnifying its intensity until the forest air was filled with thunder . The way forward leveled off , and the timber began to thicken . Atop the ridge head , freezing spray and a deep , rolling mist masked all but the faintest trace of distant blue from a noonday sky now lost far above the tangled branches of the forest trees with their damp , moss-grown bark and earthcoloredleaves shimmering bright with wetness . Ahead , the trail sloped upward once more through clusters of rock and fallen timber that loomed spectrally out of the haze like frozen giants . And still there was only the sound , massive and deafening . Yet slowly , as the trail wound on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the thrust of the wind as it raked down across the summit of the land , out of the Wolfsktaag to the lowlands east . The bowl of the valley opened before them , its wooded slopes dark and forbidding in the shadow of the mountain peaks beneath a line of ridges colored gold with sunlight . And here , at last , the source of the sound was discovered  --  a waterfall . An awesome , towering column of churning white water poured wildly through a break in the cliff rock and tumbled downward hundreds of feet through clouds of mist and spray that hung thick across the whole of the western end of the valley , downward into a great river that twisted and turned through rocks and trees until it was lost from view . In a line , the three riders drew their mounts to a halt . " The Chard Rush . " Allanon pointed to the falls . Brin gazed down wordlessly . It was as if she stood at the edge of the world . She could not describe what she felt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely a hundred yards distant , the waters of the Chard Rush crashed and swirled down rock and through crevice in a magnificent , breathtaking spectacle thatp258left her filled with wonder . Far beyond the valley into which the waters fell , the distant Eastland spread to the horizon , shimmeringslightly through the windblown spray of the falls , colored like a painting faded and worn with age , its clarity muted . A steady mist washed over the Valegirl 's dusky face and whipped through her long black hair and forest clothing like a light rain . She blinked the water from her eyes and breathed deeply the cold , hard air . In a way she could not explain , she felt as if she had been born again . Then Allanon was motioning them ahead , and the three riders began working their way down the inside slope of the wooded valley , angling toward the break in the cliff face where the falls dropped away . Single file , they wound through brush and slanted pine that clung tenaciously to the rocky soil of these upper reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathway that ran down past the falls . Rising clouds of mist enveloped them , damp and clinging against their skin . The wind died behind the rim of the ridgeline , the sound of its shrill whistle lost in the muffled roar of the falls . Sunlight dropped away into shadow , a false twilight settling over the forestland through which they passed in gradually deepening waves . Finally they reached the base of the falls and continued along the dark pathway that had brought them there to emerge at last from mist and shadow into warm sunlight . They rode eastward along the banks of the river through deep grass still green and fresh beneath a scattering of pine and yellow-leaved oak . Graduallythe roar of the falls subsided and the air grew less chill . In the trees about them , birds flew in sudden bursts of color . Life had come back again to the land . Brin sighed gratefully , thinking how relieved she was to be clear of the mountains . And then abruptly Allanon reined his horse to a stop . Almost as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest about them went still  --  a deep , layered silence that hung over everything like a shroud . Their horses came to a halt behind his . Valegirl and highlander stared at the big man and then at each other , surprise and wariness in their eyes . Allanon did not move . He simply sat there astride his horse , rigid against the light , staring ahead into the shadows of the forest trees and listening.  | " Allanon , what ... ? " Brin started to ask , but the Druid 's hand lifted sharply to cut her short . At last he turned , and the lean , dark face had drawn tight and hard , a look within the narrow eyes that neither Valegirl nor highlander had ever seen . In that instant , without understanding why it was that the feeling had come over her , Brin was suddenly terrified . The Druid did not speak . Instead , he smiled  --  a quick , sad smile  --  and turned away . His hand beckoned them after , and he started ahead into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattering of trees and dying scrub to where a small glen opened before them beside the banks of the river . There Allanon again drew his mount to a halt and this time dismounted . Rone and Brin followed him down . Together they stood there before the horses , looking out over the glen into a deepening stand of trees beyond . " What 's wrong , Allanon ? " Brin finished the question this time . The Druid did not turn . " Something comes . Listen . " They waited , motionless beside him . So complete was the silence now that even the sound of their own breathing was harsh within their ears . Brin 's premonition whispered anew in her mind , come from the rain and the gray of the Dragon 's Teeth to find her . Fear stroked her skin with its chill touch and she shivered . Suddenly , there was a sound , faint and cautious  --  a soft rustlingof dried leaves as something moved among them . " There ! " Rone cried , his hand pointing . Something came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glen . Still hidden within the gloom , it stopped suddenly , catching sight of the three who watched it . For long moments , it stayed frozen within its shelter , invisible eyes staring out at them , a silent shadow within the dark . Then , with swift and certain intent , it stepped from the trees into the light . The chill that had settled within Brin turned instantlyto frost . She had never seen anything like the creature that stood before them now . It was man-shaped in appearance , raised upright in a half-crouch , its long arms dangling loosely before it . It was a big , strong creature , lean and heavily muscled . Its skin was a strange reddish color , drawn tight against its powerfulbody ; it was hairless except for a thick ruff that grew aboutp260its loins . Great , hooked claws curled from its fingers and toes . Its face lifted toward them , and it was the face of some grotesque beast , blunt and scarred . Gleaming yellow eyes fixed upon their own , and its snout split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked teeth . " What is it ? " Rone Leah whispered in horror . " What was promised , " Allanon replied softly , his voice strangelydistracted . The reddish thing came forward a few steps further to the edge of the glen . There it stopped and waited . Allanon turned to the Valegirl and the highlander . " It is a Jachyra , a thing of another age , a thing of great evil . It was locked from the lands by the magic of the creatures of faerie in a time before the dawn of man  --  in a time even farther back than that in which the Elves created the Forbidding . Only magic of equal power could have set it free again . He straightened and brought his black robes close about him . " It appears that I was wrong  --  the Mord Wraiths did anticipate that we might come this way . Only within a place like these mountains , a place where the magic still lives , could a thing like the Jachyra be set loose again . The Wraiths have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Suppose we find out how dangerous , " Rone suggested bravely and drew forth the ebony blade of the Sword of Leah . " No . " Allanon caught his arm quickly . " This battle is mine . " The highlander glanced at Brin for support . " It seems to me that any battle to be fought on this journey must be fought by all of us . " But Allanon shook his head . " Not this time , Prince of Leah . You have shown your courage and your devotion to this girl . I no longer question either . But the power of this creature is beyondyou . I must face it alone . " " Allanon , do n't ! " Brin cried suddenly , grasping his arm . He looked down at her then , the worn face and the eyes that penetrated past all that she would hide a mask of sad determination . They stared at each other , and then without quite knowingwhy she did so , she released him . " Do n't , " she repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far side of the glen , the Jachyra gave a sudden , sharp cry that shattered the silence of the afternoon  --  a cry that was almost like a laugh . " Let me come with you ! " Rone Leah insisted , again starting forward . The Druid blocked his way . " Stand fast , Prince of Leah . Wait until you are called . " The black eyes fixed those of the highlander . " Do not interfere in this . No matter what happens , stay clear . Give me your promise . " Rone hesitated . " Allanon , I can not ... " " Give me your promise ! " The highlander stood before him defiantly for an instant longer and then reluctantly nodded . " I promise . " The Druid 's eyes turned back to the Valegirl one last time , a lost and distant look in the gaze they gave to her . " Keep you safe , Brin Ohmsford , " he whispered . Then he wheeled about and started down into the glen.  |p262Sunlight  spilled from out of the cloudless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form as it passed against the backdrop of the forest color . Warmth and sweet autumn smells lingered in the air , a teasing whisper to the Druid 's senses , and across the woodlands a soft and gentle breeze blew down through the trees to ruffle the long , black robes . Within its banks of still summer-green grasses , the river of the Chard Rush glimmered azure and silver , its gleam reflected coldly in the tall man 's eyes . He was conscious of nothing now but the sleek , reddishskinnedform that crept catlike down the far slope of the glen 's shallow bowl , yellow eyes narrowed , muzzle curled back in anticipation . Please come back ! Brin cried out the words in the silence of her mind , rendered voiceless by the horror of the familiar premonitionthat had returned suddenly to haunt her and dance in wild glee at the edges of her sight . It was this that the premonition had warned against ! The Jachyra dropped down upon all fours , muscles rippling in corded knots beneath the taut skin as slaver began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of its spine and flexed with the movement of its body as it crept to the floor of the sunlit glen . Muzzle lifting toward the dark figure across from it , the monster cried out a second time  --  that same , hideous howl that rang like maddened laughter . Allanon drew to a halt a dozen yards from where it crouched . Motionless , he faced the creature . On the hard , dark face there appeared a look of such frightening determination that it seemed to the Valegirl and the highlander that no living thing , however evil , could stand against it . Yet the Jachyra 's frenzied grin merelyp263broadened ; more hooked teeth slipped into view from out of its drawn muzzle . There was madness in the yellow eyes . For a long , terrible instant Druid and monster faced each other in the deep silence of the autumn afternoon and the whole of the world about them ceased to be . Again the Jachyra 's laughter sounded . It stepped sideways  --  an odd , swinging movement . Then , with terrifying suddenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fast . Little more than a blur of reddish fury , it sprang clear of the earth and tore into the Druid . Somehow it missed . Allanon was faster than his attacker , slippingaside as swiftly as a shadow gone with night . The Jachyra flew past the Druid , tearing into the earth beyond as it landed . Whirling with scarcely a moment 's pause , it sprang at its prey a second time . But already the Druid 's hands were extended , blue fire bursting forth . The fire ripped into the Jachyra , throwing it backward in midair . It struck the ground in a tangled heap and still the fire tore at it , burning and searing and thrusting the beast back until it came to a jarring halt against a great oak . Astonishingly , the Jachyra was back on its feet almost at once . " Shades ! " Rone Leah whispered . It came at Allanon again , dodging and twisting past the Druid fire that flew from the other 's fingers . Raging , it flung itself at the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue fire hammered into it , flinging it away , but it caught the Druid with the claws of one hand , tearing into black robes and flesh . Allanon staggered back , shrugging at the impact of the blow , the fire disappearing into smoke . In the tall grass a dozen feet away , the Jachyra came back to its feet once more . Cautiously , the two antagonists circled each other . The Druid 's arms and hands extended guardedly before him , and the dark face was a mask of fury . But in the grasses through which he stepped , droplets of his blood streaked the deep green crimson . The Jachyra 's snout split wide once more , an evil , maddened grin . Trailers of smoke curled from the reddish skin where the fire had seared it , yet the monster seemed unharmed . Iron musclesrippled as it moved , a sleek and confident dance of death that led its intended victim on . Again it attacked , a swift , fluid lunge that carried it into the Druid before the fire could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beast , holding it upright so it could not reach his body . The crooked teeth snapped viciously , trying to fasten on the tall man 's neck . Locked in this position , the two surged back and forth across the glen , twisting and squirming in an effort to gain the advantage . Then , with a tremendous heave , the Druid flung the Jachyra over backward , lifting it off its feet and throwing it to the earth . Instantly the blue fire burst from his fingers and engulfed the monster . The Jachyra 's cry was high and terrible , a frenzied shriek that froze the whole of the woods about it . Pain was in that cry , yet a pain that sounded of something inexplicably gleeful . The Jachyra leaped from the column of fire , twisting to free itself , its powerful red form steaming and alive with small bits of blue flame . It tumbled over and over through the grasses , a maddened and raging thing , consumed by an ever darker fire that burned within . It came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muzzle drew back , yellowed eyes bright and ugly . It likes the pain , Brin realized in horror . It feeds on it . Behind her , the horses snorted and backed away from the scent of the Jachyra , pulling against the reins secured in Rone Leah 's hands . The highlander glanced back worriedly , calling to the animals , trying unsuccessfully to calm them . Once again , the Jachyra came at Allanon , darting and lunging through the blaze of Druid fire that burned into it . It almost reached the black-robed figure , claws ripping , and again Allanon stepped aside just in time , the blue fire thrusting the creature away in a burst of power . Brin watched it all , sickened by the struggle but unable to look away . A single thought repeated itself in her mind , over and over . The Jachyra was too much . The Druid had fought so many terrible battles and survived ; he had faced awesome creatures of dark magic . But the Jachyra was somehow different . It was a thing ignorant and incautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's laws  --  a creature of madness , frenzy , and purposeless destruction . An ear-shattering shriek broke from the Jachyra 's throat as the monster flung itself at Allanon again . The horses reared in fright , the reins tearing free of Rone 's hands . Desperately , the highlander sought to recapture them . But the instant they pulledp265tree , the horses bolted wildly back toward the falls . In a matter of seconds , they had disappeared into the trees beyond . Rone and Brin turned back to the struggle below . Allanon had thrown up a wall of fire between himself and his attacker , the flames darting out at the Jachyra like knives as the creature sought vainly to break past . Purposefully the Druid maintained the wall , arms extended in rigid concentration . Then suddenly the arms dropped downward in a sweeping motion , bringing with them the wall of fire . Like a net it dropped across the Jachyra and the beast was consumed . It disappeared entirely for an instant , lost in a raging ball of flame . Twisting and turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it tenaciously , held fast by the Druid 's magic . Try as it might , the Jachyra could not shake free . Brin 's hand fastened on Rone . Perhaps .. . But then the Jachyra bolted sharply away from Allanon and the open grasses of the glen , into the forest trees . Still the flames clung to it , but already the fire was beginning to dissipate . The distance between Druid and beast was too great , and Allanon could not maintain his hold . Howling , the monster flung itself into a stand of pine , shattering limbs and trunks , throwing fire everywhere . Wood and pine needles splintered and flamed , and smoke rolled out of the shadows . At the center of the glen , Allanon 's hands dropped away wearily . At its edge , Brin and Rone waited in hushed silence , staring at the smoky gloom into which the beast had disappeared . The forest was still once more . " It 's gone , " Rone whispered finally . Brin did not reply . Voiceless , she waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and darkened stretch of pine . Brin felt the cold that had settled deep within her flare sharply . The Jachyra stepped out from the trees . I t glided to the edge of the glen , muzzle split wide in that hideous grin , yellow eyes gleaming . It was unharmed . " What manner of devil is this ? " Rone Leah whispered . The Jachyra crept back again toward Allanon , its breath harsh and eager . A low , anxious whine broke from its throat , and its snout lifted as if to catch the Druid 's scent . On the long grass before it , a trace of the big man 's blood dappled the green a bright scarlet . The Jachyra stopped . Slowly , deliberately , it bentp266to the blood and began to lick it from the earth . The whine turned suddenly deep with pleasure . Then it attacked . In a single , fluid motion , it gathered its hindlegsbeneath it and flung itself at Allanon . The Druid 's hands came up , fingers extending  --  too slow . The creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They tumbled down into the long grass , rolling and spinning , locked together . So quick had the attack come that the monster was atop Allanon before Brin 's sharp cry of warning could reach his ears . Blue fire flared at the tips of the Druid 's fingers , searing the wrists and forearms of his attacker as they grappled , but the fire had no effect . The Jachyra 's claws ripped into Allanon , tearing through cloth and flesh , ripping downward into bone . The Druid 's head jerked back , pain flooding across the dark face  --  a pain that went beyondphysical hurt . Desperately , the Druid sought to dislodge the beast , but the Jachyra had gotten too close and there was no room for leverage . Claws and teeth tore at Allanon , the corded body of the monstrous attacker holding its victim fast to the earth . " No ! " Rone Leah screamed suddenly . Tearing free of Brin as she sought to restrain him , the Prince of Leah charged down into the glen , the ebony blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leah ! Leah ! " he cried in fury . The promise he had give the Druid was forgotten . He could not stand back and watch Allanon die . He had saved him once ; he could do so again . " Rone , come back ! " Brin screamed after him futilely . Rone Leah reached the struggling figures an instant later . The dark blade of the Sword of Leah lifted and swept downward in a glittering arc , cutting deep into the neck and shoulders of the Jachyra , driven by the force of magic , tearing through muscle and bone . The Jachyra reared back , a frightful howl breaking from its throat , its reddish body snapping upright as if it had been broken from within . " Die , you monster ! " Rone cried in rage as he caught sight of the torn and bloodied figure of Allanon beneath . But the Jachyra did not die . One corded arm swung about sharply and caught the highlander across the face with stunning force . He flew backward , hands releasing their grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was after him , howling all the whilep267in maddened delight , almost as if the greater pain pleased it in some foul , incomprehensible way . It caught Rone before he fell , seized him in its claws and flung him the length of the glen to lie in a crumpled heap . Then it straightened . The dark blade of the Sword of Leah was still buried in its body . Reaching back , the Jachyra wrenched the sword free as if the blow had meant nothing to it . It hesitated an instant , the blade held before its yellow eyes . Then it hurled the Sword of Leah from it , into the air high above the waters of the Chard Rush , to fall into their grasp and be carried from sight like a piece of deadwood , bobbing and spinning in the swift current . The Jachyra spun back around toward the fallen figure of Allanon . Astonishingly , the Druid was on his feet again , black robes shredded and stained dark with his blood . Seeing him risen , the Jachyra seemed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this time the Druid did not try to stop it . Catching the Jachyra in midleap , his great hands closed about its neck like a vise . Heedless of the claws that tore at his body , he forced the monster backward to the ground , the hands squeezing . Shrieks rose out of the Jachyra 's damaged throat and the reddish body twisted like a snake that has been pierced . Still the Druid 's hands crushed inward . The muzzle split wide , teeth snapping and rippingat the air . Then abruptly Allanon 's hands released and jammed downwardinto the open maw . They thrust deep into the monster 's throat . From the clasped fingers blue fire ripped downward . Convulsions shook the Jachyra , and its limbs flung wide . The Druid fire burned through its powerful body , down into the very core of its being . It struggled to break free for only an instant . Then the fire broke out of it from everywhere , and it exploded in a blinding flash of blue light . Brin turned away , shielding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allanon knelt alone atop a pile of charred ash . Brin went first to the unconscious Rone , who lay sprawled in a twisted heap at the back edge of the glen , his breathing shallow and slow . Gently she straightened him , feeling carefully about his limbs and body for signs of breakage . She found none and ,  |p268after  wiping clean the cuts on his face , she hurried down to Allanon . The Druid still knelt within the ashes that had been the Jachyra , his arms folded tight against his body , his head lowered against his chest . His long black robes were shredded and soaked with his blood . Slowly Brin knelt beside him , a stricken look on her face as she saw what had been done to him . The Druid lifted his head wearily , hard eyes locking on her own . " I am dying , Brin Ohmsford , " he said quietly . She tried to shake her head , but his hand lifted to stop her . " Hear me , Valegirl . It was foretold that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade of Bremen , my father , said to me that it should be . He said that I must pass from the land and that I would not come again . He said that it would happen before our quest was done . " He winced with sudden pain , his face tightening in response . " I thought that perhaps I could make it otherwise . But the Wraiths . . . the Wraiths found a way to set free the Jachyra , knowing perhaps . . . at least hoping that I would be the one it would encounter . It is a thing of insanity . It feeds on its own pain and on the pain of others . In its madness , it wounds not just the body , but the spirit as well . There is no defense . It would have torn itself apart . . . just to see me destroyed . It is a poison . . . He choked on the words . Brin bent close , swallowing back the hurt and fear . " We must dress the wounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is finished , " he cut her short . " There is no help for me . It must be for me as it was foretold . " He glanced across the glen slowly . " But you must help the Prince of Leah . The poison will be in him as well . He is your protector now . . . as he said he would be . " His eyes shifted back to her own . " Know that his sword is not lost . The magic will not let it be lost . It must . . . find its way to mortal hands . . . the river will carry it to those hands . . . Again he choked on the words , this time doubling over sharply against the pain of his wounds . Brin reached out and caught him , held him upright , close against her . " Do n't talk anymore , " she whispered , tears filling her eyes.  |p269Slowly  he pulled away from her , straightening . Blood coated her hands and arms where she had held him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Wraiths think that I am the one they need fear  --  that I am the one who can destroy them . " He shook his head slowly . " They are wrong . You are the power , Brin . You are the one that . . . nothing can stand against . " One hand fastened on her arm in a grip of iron . " Hear me well . Your father mistrusts the Elven magic ; he fears what it can do . I tell you now that he has reason to mistrust it , Valegirl . The magic can be a thing of light or a thing of dark for the one who possesses it . It seems a toy , perhaps , but it has never been that . lie wary of its power . It is power like nothing I have ever seen . Keep it your own . Use it well , and it will see you safely through to the end of your quest . Use it well , and it will see the Ildatch destroyed ! " " Allanon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried softly , shaking her head in despair . " You can and you must . As with your father ... there is no one else . " His dark face lowered . She nodded dumbly , barely hearing him , lost in the jumble of emotions that raged within her as she fought back against the inevitability of what was happening . " The age passes , " Allanon whispered and the black eyes glistened . " So must the Druids pass with it . " His hand lifted to fall gently on hers . " But the trust I carry for them must not pass , Valegirl . It must remain with those who live . That trust I give now to you . Bend close . " Brin Ohmsford leaned forward until her face was directly before his . Slowly , painfully , the Druid slipped one hand within the shredded robes to his chest , then brought it forth again , the fingers dipped into his own blood . Gently he touched her forehead . Holding the fingers to her flesh , warm with his lifeblood , he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his touch and of the words seemed to seep into her , filling her with a rush of exhilaration that swept across her vision in a surge of blinding color and then was gone . " What ... have you done to me ? " she asked him haltingly . But the Druid did not answer . " Help me to my feet , " he commanded her.  |p270She  stared at him . " You can not walk , Allanon ! You are too badly hurt ! " A strange , unfamiliar gentleness filled the dark eyes . " Help me to my feet , Brin . I will not have to walk far . " Reluctantly she wrapped her arms about him and eased him from the ground . Blood soaked the grasses upon which he had knelt and the mass of ashes that had been the Jachyra . " Oh , Allanon ! " Brin was crying freely now . " Walk me to the river 's edge , " he whispered . Slowly , unsteadily , they stumbled across the empty glen to where the Chard Rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone a brilliant gold , warm and friendly as it brightened the autumn day . It was a day of life , not of death , and Brin cried within that it could not become so for Allanon . They reached the bank of the river . Gently the Valegirl let the Druid settle once more into a kneeling position , his dark head lowered against the sunlight . " When your quest is done , Brin , " he said to her , " you will find me here . " His face lifted to hers . " Now stand away . " Stricken , she stepped slowly back from him . Tears ran down her face , and her hands made pleading motions to the slouched form . Allanon stared back at her for a long moment , then turned away . One blood-streaked arm lifted toward the waters of the Chard Rush , stretching out above them . The river went still instantly , its surface as calm and placid as that of a sheltered pond . A strange , hollow silence descended over everything . A moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently and from the depths of the river rose the cries that had come from the waters of the Hadeshorn  --  high and piercing . They sounded for but an instant , and then all was still once more . On the river 's edge , Allanon 's hand dropped to his side and his head bowed . Then the spectral figure of Bremen rose from the Chard Rush . Gray and nearly transparent against the afternoon light , the shade rose to stand upon the river 's waters , ragged and bent with age . " Father , " Brin heard Allanon call softly  |p271The  shade came forward , gliding motionlessly on the still surface of the river . It came to where the Druid knelt . There it bent slowly downward and gathered the stricken form in its arms . Without turning , it moved back across the water , Allanon cradledclose . It stopped again at the center of the Chard Rush , and beneath it the waters boiled fiercely , hissing and steaming . Then it sank slowly back into the river , and the last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still an instant longer , and then the magic was ended and it began to churn eastward once again . " Allanon ! " Brin Ohmsford cried . Alone on the riverbank she stared out across the swift-flowing waters and waited for the reply that would never come.  |p272After  capturing Jair at the fall of the Dwarf fortress of Capaal , the Mwellret Stythys marched him north through the wilderness of the Anar . Following the twists and turns of the Silver River as it wove threadlike through trees and brush , over cliffs , and across ravines , they passed deep into the forestlandand the darkness that lay close about . All the while they traveled , the Valeman was kept gagged and leashed like an animal . Only at mealtimes was he freed of his bonds so that he might eat , and the cold reptilian eyes of the Mwellret were always upon him . Gray , rain-filled hours slipped away with agonizing slowness as the march wore on , and all that had been of the Valeman 's life , his friends and companions , and his hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods were dank and fetid , infused by the poisoned waters of the Silver River with rot and choked by dying brush and trees clustered so thickly that the whole of the sky was screened away by their tangle . Only the river gave them any sense of direction as it flowed sluggishly past , blackened and fouled . Others passed north in those days as well , bound for the deep Anar . On the wide road that ran parallel to the Silver River , which the Mwellret cautiously avoided , caravans of Gnome soldiersand their prisoners trekked in steady procession , mired in mud and laden with the pillage of an invading army . The prisonerswere bound and chained  --  men who had fought as defendersat Capaal . They stumbled past in long lines , herded like cattle , Dwarves , Elves , and Bordermen , haggard , beaten , and stripped of hope . Jair looked down on them through the trees above the roadway over which they traveled and there were tears in his eyes.  |p273Armies  of Gnomes from Graymark also traveled the road , southbound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes already advancing into the lands of the Dwarf people . Thousands came , grim and frightening , their hard yellow faces twisted with jeers as they called to the hapless prisoners that marched past them . Mord Wraiths came , too , though no more than a handful , dark and shadowed things that walked alone and were avoided by all . The weather turned worse as the journey wore on . Skies turned black with thunderclouds and the rain began to fall in steady sheets . Lightning flashed in brilliant streaks and booming peals of thunder rolled the length of the sodden land . Autumn 's trees drooped and matted with the wet , the colored leaves sinking and falling into the mire , and the ground turned muddied and uncertain . A gray and dismal cast settled down across the forestland , and it seemed as if the skies pressed against the earth to choke its life away . Jair Ohmsford felt as if that might be so as he trudged helplesslythrough the wilderness brush , pulled on by the leather bindings gripped in the hands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within him . As the hours passed , exhaustion began to take its toll . A fever settled in , and , as it did so , his mind began to wander . Flashes of what had brought him to this sorry state mingled with childhood memories in garbledbits of still-life that hovered briefly within his sticken mind and disappeared . Sometimes he was not entirely lucid , and strange and frightening visions would wrack him , stealing through his thoughts like thieves . Even when he was free momentarilyof the effects of the fever , a dark despair colored his thoughts . There was no hope for him now , it whispered . Capaal , the defenders that had held her , and all of his friends and companionswere gone . Images of them in the moment of their fall flashed in his mind with the blinding clarity of the lightning that crackled overhead through the canopy of the trees : Garet Jax , pulled deep into the gray waters of the Cillidellan by the Kraken ; Foraker and Helt , buried beneath the wall of stone rubble brought down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running heedlessly down the underground corridors of the fortress before him , never looking back , never seeing . Even Brin , Allanon ,  |p274and  Rone appeared at times , lost somewhere deep within the Anar . Sometimes thoughts of the King of the Silver River would come to him , clear and strangely poignant , filled with the wonder and the mystery of the old man . Remember , they whispered in soft , anxious tones . Do not forget what you must do . But he had forgotten , it seemed . Tucked within his tunic , hidden from the prying eyes of the Mwellret , were the gifts of magic the old man had bestowed on him  --  the vision crystal and the leather bag with the Silver Dust . He had them still and he meant to keep them . But somehow their purpose was strangely unclear , lost in the swell of the fever , hidden in the wanderings of his mind . Finally , when they stopped for the night , the Mwellret saw that he was taken with fever and gave him a medicine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist with a cup of dark , bitter ale . The Valeman tried to refuse the drink , wracked with the fever and his own sense of uncertainty , but the Mwellret forced it down him . Shortly after , he fell asleep and slept that night untroubled . At dawn he was given more of the bitter potion ; by dusk of the second night , the fever had begun to subside . They slept that night within a cave on a high ridgeline overlooking the dark curve of the river , dryer and warmer than they had been on previous nights , free of the extreme discomfort that had plagued them in the open forest . It was on this night that Jair again came to speak with his captor . They had finished their meal of ground roots and dried beef and drunk a small measure of the bitter ale ; now they sat facing each other in the dark , huddled down within their cloaks against the night 's chill . Without , the rain fell in a slow , steady drizzle , spattering noisily against trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced the gag in the Valeman 's mouth as he had done the past two nights , but had left it loose about his neck . He sat watching Jair , his cold eyes glittering , his reptilian face a vague shadow within the darkness of his cowl . He made no move , nor did he speak . He simply sat and watched as the Valeman crouched across from him . The minutes slipped by , and at last Jair grew determined to engage the creature in conversation . " Where are you taking me ? " he ventured cautiously.  |p275Slitted  eyes narrowed further , and it was then the Valeman realized that the Mwellret had been waiting for him to speak . " We go into the High Benss . " Jair shook his head , not understanding . " The High Bens ? " " Mountainss below the Ravensshorn , Elfling , " the other hissed . " Sstay for a time within thosse mountains . Put you in the Gnome prissonss at Dun Fee Aran ! " Jair 's throat tightened . " Prison ? You plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine sstay there , " the other rasped , laughing softly . The Valeman stiffened at the sound of the laughter and fought back against the fear that washed through him . " Why are you doing this to me ? " he demanded angrily . " What do you want from me ? " " Hss ! " A hooked finger pointed . " Doess the Elfling truly not know ? Doess he not ssee ? " The cloaked form hunched closer . " Then lissten , little peopless . Hear ! Ourss wass the gifted peopless , lordss over all the mountains ' life . Comess to uss the Dark Lord many yearss gone passt now , and a bargain wass sstruck . Little Gnome peopless ssent to sserve the Dark Lord if he leavess our peopless be , lordss sstill within the mountains . Doess thiss , the Dark Lord , and in hiss time passsess from the earth . But we endure . We live ! " The crooked finger twisted slowly . " Then comess the walkerss , climbed from the dark pit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dark Lord , they ssay . Give we up our homess , they ssay . Give we up the little peopless that sserve uss . Bargainss mean nothing now . We refusse the walkerss , the Wraithss . We are sstrong alsso . But ssomething done to uss . We ssicken and die . No young are born . Our peoplessfail . Yearss passs , and we weaken to a handful . Sstill the walkerss ssay we musst go from the mountains . At lasst we are too few , and the walkerss drive uss forth ! " He paused then , and the green slitted eyes burned deep into the Valeman 's , filled with rage and bitterness . " Left me for dead , did the walkerss , the Wraithss . Black thingss of evil . But I live ! " Jair stared at the monster . Stythys was admitting to him that the Mwellrets in the time of Shea Ohmsford had sold to the Warlock Lord the lives of the mountain Gnomes so that theyp276might be used to fight against the Southland in the aborted Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to preservetheir lordship over their mountain kingdom in the Ravenshorn . It was as Foraker had told him and as the Dwarf people had suspected . But then the Mord Wraiths had come , successors to the power of the dark magic of the Warlock Lord . The Eastlandwas to be theirs now , and the Ravenshorn would no longer belong the the Mwellrets . When the lizard things had resisted , the Wraiths had sickened and destroyed them . So Stythys had indeed been driven forth from his homeland to be found by the Dwarves and brought into Capaal .. . " But what has all this to do with me ? " he demanded , a sinking suspicion settling through him . " Magicss ! " the Mwellret hissed instantly . " Magicss , little friend ! I wissh what you posssess . Ssongss you ssing musst be mine ! You have the magicss ; you musst give them to me ! " " But I ca n't ! " Jair exclaimed in frustration . A grimace twisted the other 's scaled face . " Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my peopless  --  not to the Wraithss . Your magicss sshall be given , Elfling . At the prissonssyou sshall give them . You will ssee . " Jair looked away . It was the same with Stythys as it had been with the Gnome Sedt Spilk  --  both had wanted mastery over something that Jair could not give them . The magic of the wishsongwas his , and only he could use it . It would be as useless to the Mwellret as it had been to the Sedt . And then a chilling thought struck him . Suppose that Stythys knew that ? Suppose that the Mwellret knew he could not have the magic , but that he must make use of it through Jair ? The Valeman remembered what had been done to him in that cell in Capaal  --  how the Mwellret had made him reveal the magic .. . He caught his breath . Oh , shades ! Suppose Stythys knew  --  or suppose that he even suspected  --  that there were other magics ? Suppose he sensed the presence of the vision crystal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he whispered , almost before he realizedwhat he was saying . There was a hint of desperation in his voice.  |p277The  Mwellret 's reply was a soft hiss . " Prissonss will change your mind , little peopless . You will ssee . " Jair Ohmsford lay awake for a long time after that , gagged and hobbled once more , lost in the darkness of his thoughts as he listened to the sounds of the rainfall and the breathing of the sleeping Mwellret . Shadows lay all about the entrance to the little cave ; without , the wind blew the stormclouds above the sodden forest . What was he to do ? Behind him lay his quest and his shattered plans for saving Brin . Before him lay the Gnome prisons of Dun Fee Aran . Once locked within their walls , he might never come away again , for it was certain that the Mwellret meant to keep him there until he had revealed what he knew of the secrets of the Elven magic . But he would never give up those secrets . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver River in exchange for the life of his sister . He would never give them up . Yet he sensed that , despite his resolve and whatever strength he could muster to resist his captor , sooner or later Stythys would find a way to wrest those secrets from him . Thunder rumbled in the distance somewhere , rolling across the forestland , deep and ominous . More ominous still was the despair of the Valeman . It was a long time before exhaustion overcame him and he at last fell asleep . Jair and the Mwellret resumed their march north with the coming of dawn on the third day , plodding through rain , mist , and sodden woods , and at midday they passed into the High Bens . The mountains were dark and rugged , a cluster of broken peaks and crags that straddled the Silver River where it washed down out of the high forestland below the Ravenshorn . The two climbed into their midst , swallowed by mist that clung to the rocks until at last , as the day waned and the night began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortress of Dun Fee Aran . Dun Fee Aran was a sprawling , castlelike complex of walls , towers , watches , and battlements . The whole of the fortress had a gray and dreary cast to it as it materialized out of the rain before them , one that would have been there , Jair sensed , even in the best of weather . Wordlessly , they trudged from the trees , the tall , cloaked Mwellret leading the hobbled Valeman , and passed through the brush and scrub of the bluff face into thep278sodden camp . Gnome Hunters and retainers of all ranks and standings plodded past them across the muddied grounds , cloaked and hooded against the weather and caught up in their own concerns . No one questioned them . No one gave them a second look . They passed over stone parapets and walkways , over walls and causeways , down stairs , and through halls . The night began to deepen and the light to fail . Jair felt as if the world were closing in about him , shutting him away . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetid reek of cells and human bodies . Lives were expended here without much thought , he sensed with a chill . Lives were locked away within these walls and forgotten . A huge , blocklike structure loomed before them , windows no more than tiny slits through the stones , doors ironbound and massive . They entered this building and silence closed about them . " Prissonss , Elfling , " Jair heard the Mwellret whisper back at him . They traversed a maze of dark and shadowed corridors , hallwaysfilled with doors whose bolts and hinges showed rust and cobwebs undisturbed by the passage of time . Jair felt cold and empty as he watched row after row of these doors pass away . Their boots echoed dully in the silence , and only the distant sound of iron clanging and stone being chiseled came otherwise to his ears . Jair 's eyes scanned dismally the walls that rose about him . How will I ever get out of here ? he wondered in the silence of his mind . How will I ever find my way ? Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small cloaked form came into view . It was a Gnome , aged and ruined , yellow face ravaged by some nameless disease so loathsome that Jair pulled back against the leather ties that bound him . Stythys advanced to where the Gnome stood waiting , bent over the ugly little man , and made a few cryptic signs with his fingers . The Gnome replied in kind ; with a brief motion of one crooked hand , he bade them follow . They went deeper into the prisons , the light from the world without all but lost in the twist of stone and mortar . Only the torch showed them the way , burning and smoking through the blackness.  |p279They  stopped at last before an ironbound door similar to the hundreds they had passed before it . Hands twisting roughly about the metal latch , the Gnome wrenched its bolt free . With a grating screech , he brought the heavy portal open . Stythys looked back at Jair , then pulled at the leash and brought him forward into the room beyond . It was a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw bundled in one corner and a wooden bucket next to the door . A single tiny slit cut into the far wall let though a sliver of gray light from without . The Mwellret turned , cut free the bonds that tied Jair 's hands and slipped loose the gag that bound his mouth . Roughly , he shoved the Valeman past him onto the bed of straw . " Thiss iss yourss , Elfling , " he hissed . " Home for little peopless until you tell me of the magicss . " The crooked finger pointed back to the hunched form of the Gnome behind him . " Your jailer , Elfling . He iss mine , one who sstill obeyss . Mute he issdoessnot sspeak or hear . Ssongss of magicss usseless on him . Feedss and tendss you , he doess . " He paused . " Hurtss you , too , if you dissobeyss . " The Gnome 's ravaged face was turned toward the Valeman as Stythys spoke , but revealed nothing of what the mind behind it thought . Jair glanced about bleakly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Mwellret whisperedsuddenly . " Tellss me or never leavess thiss plasse ! " The cold voice hung with a hiss in the silence of the little room as the yellow eyes bore deep into the Valeman 's . Then Stythys wheeled away and strode back through the cellroom door . The Gnome jailer turned as well , crooked hands gripping the ironbound door by its latch bolt and pulling it firmly shut . Huddled alone in the dark , Jair listened until the sound of their footfalls had disappeared . The minutes slipped away into hours as he sat motionless within the cell , listening to the silence and thinking of how hopelesshis position had become . Smells assailed his nostrils as he sat there , rank and harsh , mingling with the sense of despair that coursed relentlessly through him . He was scared now , so scared that he could barely bring himself to think . The thought had never crossed his mind before in all the time that had passed since he had abandoned his home in Shady Vale , fleeing fromp280the Gnomes that hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . You are going to fail , it whispered . He would have cried then if he could have made himself do so , but somehow the tears would not come . Perhaps he was too frightened even for that . Think about how you will escape this place , he ordered himself . There is always a way out of everything . He took a deep breath to steady himself . What would Garet Jax do in this situation ? Or even Slanter ? Slanter always had a way out ; Slanter was a survivor . Even Rone Leah would have been able to come up with something . His thoughts drifted for a time , wandering through memories of what had been , sidestepping effortlessly into dreams of what might somehow yet be . All of it was fantasy , false rendering of truths twisted in the madness of his own despair to become what he would have them be . Then at last he made himself rise and walk about his tiny prison , exploring what he could already see was there , touching the damp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that slipped through the airhole from the skies without . He journeyed all about the cell , studying to no particular purpose , waiting for his emotions to still themselves and his thoughts to settle . Suddenly he decided to use the vision crystal . If he were to have any sense of what time remained to him , he must discover what had become of Brin . Hurriedly , he brought the crystal and its silver chain out from their place of concealment within his tunic . He stared down at the crystal , cupped gently within his hands . He could hear the old King 's voice whispering to him , cautioning him that this would be the means by which he could follow Brin 's progress . All he need do was sing to it .. . Softly , he sang . At first , his voice would not come , choked with emotions that swam restlessly through him still . Yet he hardened himself against his own sense of uncertainty , and the sound of the wishsong filled the tiny room . Almost at once , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom and chasing the shadows before it . He saw at once that it came from a small fire , and Brin 's face was before him , obviously studying the flames of a campfire.  |p281Her  lovely face was cupped in her hands . Then she looked up and seemed to be searching . There were signs of strain and worry , and she looked almost haggard . Then she looked down again and sighed . She shuddered slightly , as if repressing a sob . All of her that Jair could see seemed to be given over to despair . Whatever had happened to her had obviously been unpleasant .. . Jair 's voice broke as worry for his sister flooded through him , and the image of his sister 's frowning face wavered and vanished . The Valeman stared down in stunned silence at the crystal cupped in his hands . Where , he wondered , was Allanon ? There had been no sign of him in the crystal . Leaves in the wind , the voice of the King of the Silver River whispered in his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly about the vision crystal and stared sightlessly into the darkness.  |p282ight  had settled down across the forests of the Anar whenBrin Ohmsford saw the lights . They winked at her like fireflies through the screen of the trees and shadows that stretched away into the dark , small , elusive , and distant . She slowed , her arms wrapping quickly about Rone to keep him from falling as he stumbled to a halt beside her . An aching weariness wracked her body , but she forced herself to hold the highlander upright as he fell against her , his head drooping to her shoulder , his face hot and flushed with the fever. ... ca n't find where ... lost , ca n't find ... " he muttered incoherently and the fingers of his hand gripped her arm until it hurt . She whispered to him , letting him hear her voice and know she was still there . Slowly the fingers relaxed their grip , and the fevered voice went silent . Brin stared ahead at the lights . They danced through forest boughs still thick with autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She whispered the word urgently , and it pushed back against the despair and the hopelessness that had closed in about her in steadily deepening layers since the march east from the Chard Rush had begun . How long ago it all seemed now  --  Allanongone , Rone so badly wounded , and she alone . She closed her eyes against the memory . She had walked all that afternoon and into the night , following the run of the Chard Rush eastward , hoping , praying that it would lead her to some other human being who could help her . She did n't know how long or how far she had walked ; she had lost track of time and distance . She only knew that somehow she had managed to keep going.  |p283She  straightened , pulling Rone upright . Ahead , the lights flickered their greeting . Please ! she cried silently . Please , let it be the help I need ! She trudged ahead , Rone 's arm looped about her shoulders , his body sagging against hers as he stumbled beside her . Tree limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bent her head against them . Putting one foot before the other with wooden doggedness , she went forward . Her strength was almost gone . If there was no help to be had here .. . Then abruptly the screen of trees and shadows broke apart before her , and the source of the lights stood revealed . A buildingloomed ahead , shadowed and dark , save for slivers of yellow light that escaped from two places in its squarish bulk . Voices sounded from somewhere within , faint and indistinct . Holding Rone close , she pushed on . As she drew nearer , the building began to come into focus . A low , squat structure with a peaked roof , it was constructed of timbers and sideboards on a stone foundation . A covered porch fronted a single storey with a garret , and a stable sat back away from the rear of the building . Two horses and a mule stood tied to a hitching post , heads loweredto crop the drying grass . Along the front of the building , a series of windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the gaps in the shutters that light thrown by oil lamps had escaped and been seen by the Valegirl . " A little farther , Rone , " she whispered , knowing that he did n't understand , but would respond to the sound of her voice . When she was a dozen feet from the porch , she saw the sign that hung from the eaves of its sloping roof : ROOKER LINE TRADINGCENTER . The sign swayed gently in the night wind , weathered and split , the paint so badly faded into the wood that the letters were barely legible . Brin glanced up at it briefly and looked away . All that mattered was that there were people inside . They climbed onto the porch , stumbling and tripping on the weathered boards , to sag against the door jamb . Brin groped for the handle , and the voices within suddenly went still . Then the Valegirl 's hand closed about the metal latch , and the heavy door swung open.  |p284A  dozen rough faces turned to stare at her , a mix of surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a haze of smoke and exhaustion  --  bearded and unkempt , their clothes of worn leather and animal skins . Hard-looking , they clustered in groups about a serving bar formed of wood planks laid crosswiseon upended ale kegs . Animal pelts and provisions lay stacked behind the counter , and a series of small tables with stools sat before it . Oil lamps hung from low-beamed ceiling rafters and cast their harsh light against the night shadows . With her arms wrapped about Rone , Brin stood silently in the open doorway and waited . " They 's ghosts ! " someone muttered suddenly from along the serving counter , and there was a shuffling of feet . A tall , thin man in shirt-sleeves and apron came out from behind the counter , head shaking slowly . " If they was dead things , they 'd have no need to open the door now , would they ? They 'd just walk right on through ! " He crossed to the middle of the room and stopped . " What 's happened to you , girl ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain that assailed her , how they must appear to these men . They might well have been something brought back from the dead  --  two worn and ragged things , their clothing damp and muddied , their faces white with exhaustion , hanging onto each other like strawfilledscarecrows . A bloodied strip of cloth had been bound about Rone 's head , but the rawness of the wound showed through . On his back , the scabbard that had once held the great broadsword lay empty . Her own face was soiled and drawn , and her dark eyes haunted . Spectral apparitions , they stood framed in the light of the open doorway , swaying unevenly against the night . Brin tried to speak , but no words came out . " Here , lend a hand , " the tall man called back to the others at the counter , coming forward at once to catch hold of Rone . " Come on now , lend a hand ! " A brawny woodsman came forward quickly , and the two usheredthe Valegirl and the highlander to the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumped forward with a groan , his head sagging.  | " What 's happened to you ? " the tall man repeated once again , helping to hold the highlander in place so he would not fall . " This one 's burning up with fever ! " Brin swallowed thickly . " We lost our horses in a fall coming down out of the mountains , " she lied . " He was sick before then , but it 's grown worse . We walked the riverbank until we found this place . " My place , " the tall man informed her . " I 'm a trader here . Jeft , draw a couple ales for these two . " The woodsman slipped behind the counter to an ale keg and opened the spigot into two tall glasses . " How about a free one for the rest of us , Stebb ? " one of a group of hard-looking men at the far end of the counter called out . The trader shot the man a venomous look , brushed back a patch of thinning hair atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Should n't be in those mountains , girl . There 's worse than fever up there . " Brin nodded wordlessly , swallowing against the dryness in her throat . A moment later the woodsman returned with the glasses of ale . He passed one to the Valegirl , then propped Rone up long enough to see that he sipped at the other . The highlander tried to grasp the glass and gulp the harsh liquid down , choking as he did . The woodsman moved the glass away firmly . " Let him drink ! " the speaker at the end of the bar called out again . Another laughed . " Naw , it 's wasted ! Any fool can see he 's dying ! " Brin glanced up angrily . The man who had spoken saw her look and sauntered toward her , his broad face breaking into an insolent grin . The others in the group trailed after , winking knowingly and chuckling . " Something the matter , girl ? " the speaker sneered . " Afraid you . . . ?  --  Instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was doing as she snatched her long knife from its sheath and brought it up in front of his face . " Now , now , " the woodsman Jeft interceded quickly at her side , pushing her gently back . " No need for that , is there ? "  |p286He  turned to face the speaker , standing directly before him . The woodsman was a big man , and he towered over the men who had come down from the end of the counter . The members of the group glanced at one another uncertainly . " Sure , Jeft , no harm meant , " the offender muttered . He looked down at Rone . " Just wondered about that scabbard . Crest looks like a royal seal of some type . " His dark eyes shifted to Brin . " Where you from , girl ? " He waited a moment , but Brin refused to answer . " No matter . " He shrugged . With his friends trailing after him he moved back down the counter . Gathering close to resume their drinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woodsman stared after them for a moment , then knelt down beside Brin . " Worthless bunch , " he muttered . " Camp out west of Spanning Ridge masquerading as trappers . Live by their wits and the misfortuneof others . " " Been drinking and wasting time here since morning . " The trader shook his head . " Always got the money for the ale , though . " He looked at the Valegirl . " Feeling a little better now ? " Brin smiled in response . " Much better , thank you . " She glanced down at the dagger in her hand . " I do n't know what 's wrong with me . I do n't know what I was ... " " Hush , forget it . " The big woodsman patted her hand . " You 're exhausted . " Beside him , Rone Leah moaned softly , his head lifting momentarily , his eyes open and staring into space . Then he slipped down again . " I have to do something for him , " Brin insisted anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fever . Do you have anything here that might help ? " The trader glanced at the woodsman worriedly , then shook his head . " I 've not seen a fever as bad as this one often , girl . I have a tonic that might help . You can give it to the boy and see if it brings the fever out . " He shook his head again . " Sleep might be best , though . " Brin nodded dumbly . She was having trouble thinking clearly , the exhaustion folding in about her as she sat staring down at the dagger . Slowly she slipped it back into its sheath . What had she been thinking she would do ? She had never harmed anythingp287in her entire life . Certainly the man from west of Spanning Ridge had been insolent , perhaps even threatening  --  but had there been any real danger to her ? The ale burned warmly in her stomach , and a flush spread through her body . She was tired and strangely unnerved . Deep within , she felt an odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in here for sleeping , " the trader Stebb was saying . " There 's a tack room in back of the stable I let the help use in the trapping season . You can have that . There 's a stove and bed for your friend and straw for you . " " That would be fine , " Brin murmured and found to her astonishment that she was crying . " Here , here . " The burly woodsman put an arm about her shoulders , blocking her away from the view of those gathered along the serving counter . " Wo n't do for them to see that , girl . Got to be strong , now . " Brin nodded wordlessly , wiped the tears away , and stood up . " I 'm all right . " " Blankets are out in the shed , " the trader announced , standing up with her . " Let 's get you settled in . " With the aid of the woodsman , he brought Rone Leah back to his feet and walked him toward the rear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ran past a set of storage rooms . Brin shot a parting glance at the men gathered about their ale glasses before the serving counter and followed after . She did n't much care for the looks directed back her way by the ones from west of Spanning Ridge . A small wooden door opened out into the night at the back of the building , and the trader , the woodsman , Rone , and Brin moved toward the stable and its tack room . The trader slipped ahead , quickly lighted an oil lamp hanging from a peg on one wall , and then held wide the tack room door to admit the others . The room beyond was clean , though a bit musty , its walls hung with traces and harness . A small iron stove sat in one corner , shielded by a stone alcove . A single bed sat close beside it . A pair of shuttered windows stood against the night . The trader and the woodsman laid the feverish highlander carefully on the bed and covered him with the blankets stacked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wood was burning brightly and carried in a pallet of fresh straw for Brin.  |p288As  they were about to leave , the trader placed the oil lamp on a stone ledge next to the stove and turned briefly to Brin . " Here 's the tonic for his fever . " He passed a small , ambercoloredbottle to the Valegirl . " Give him two swallows  --  no more . In the morning , two more . " He shook his head doubtfully . " Hope it helps , girl . " He started through the doorway with the woodsman in tow . Then once more he turned . " There 's a latch on this door , " he declared , pausing . " Keep it drawn . " He closed the door softly behind him . Brin walked over and drew the latch into place . From just without , she could hear the voices of the trader and the woodsman as they talked . " A bad lot , that Spanning Ridge bunch , " the woodsman muttered . " Bad as any , " the trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time for me to be on my way , " the woodsman said . " Several hours back to the camp . " " Safe journey , " the trader replied . They started to move away , their words fading . " You 'd best watch youself that that bunch inside , Stebb , " the woodsman advised . " Watch yourself close . " Then the words died away completely and the two were gone . Brin turned back to Rone within the silence of the tack room . Propping him up carefully , she forced him to take two swallows of the tonic provided by the trader . When he had taken the medicine , she laid him down again and covered him up . Then she took a seat next to the stove , wrapped herself in her blanket , and sat back wordlessly . On the wall of the little room , cast by the solitary flame of the oil lamp , her shadow rose up before her like a dark giant . The charred stump of still-burning log collapsed with a thud inside the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke with a start . She had dozed , she realized , but did n't know for how long . She rubbed her eyes wearily and glanced about . The tack room was dark and still , the flame of the oil lamp faint and lonely in a gathering of shadows . She thought immediately of Allanon . It was difficult still for her to accept that the Druid was gone . An expectation lingeredp289within her that at any moment there would come a sharp knock upon the latched door and his deep voice would call to her . Like a shadow that came and went with the passing of the light  --  that was the way that Rone had described him that last night before the Druid died .. . She caught herself sharply , strangely ashamed that she had allowed herself to even think the word . But Allanon had died , passing from the world of mortal men as all must , going from the Four Lands in the arms of his father  --  perhaps to where Bremen kept watch . She thought about that possibility for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be with his father ? She remembered his words to her : " When your quest is done , Brin , you will find me here . " Did that mean that he , too , had locked himself into a limbo existence between the worlds of life and death ? There were tears in her eyes , and she wiped them hurriedly away . She could not permit herself tears . Allanon was gone , and she was alone . Rone Leah stirred restlessly beneath the heavy blankets , his breathing harsh and uneven . She rose slowly and moved to where he lay . The lean , sunburned face was hot , dry , and drawn tight against the fever that ravaged his body . He shivered momentarilyas she watched , as if suddenly chill , then went taut . Words whispered on his lips , their meaning lost . What am I to do with him ? the Valegirl asked herself helplessly . Would that I had my father 's skill . I have given him the tonic provided by the trader . I have wrapped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to be helping . What else am I to do ? It was the Jachyra 's poison that was infecting him , she knew . Allanon had said that the poison attacked not just the body , but the spirit as well . It had killed the Druid  --  and while his wounds had been so much worse than Rone 's , still he was Allanon and much the stronger of the two . Even the lesser damage suffered by the highlander was proving to be more than his body could fight . She sank down next to his bed , her hand closing gently about his . Her protector . She smiled sadly  --  who would now protect him ?  |p290Memories  slipped like quicksilver through her mind , jumbled and confused . They had gone through so much to reach this lonely , desperate night , she and Rone Leah . And at what terrible cost . Paranor was gone . Allanon was dead . Even the Sword of Leah , the one real piece of magic they possessed between them , was gone . All that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishsong would be enough .. . Booted feet shuffled softly on the earthen floor of the stable without . Blessed with the Elven senses of her forefathers , she caught the noise where another might have missed it . Hurriedly , she dropped Rone 's hand and scrambled to her feet , her wearinessforgotten . Someone was out there  --  someone who did n't want to be heard . One hand crept guardedly to the haft of the long knife sheathed at her waist , then dropped away . She could not do that . She would not . The latch on the door jiggled softly and caught . " Who 's there ? " she called out . A low cursing sounded from just outside , and abruptly several heavy bodies slammed into the tack room door . Brin backed away , searching hurriedly for another way out . There was none . Again the bodies slammed into the door . The iron latch gave way with an audible snap and five dark forms came crashing into the room , the faint light of the oil lamp glinting dully off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the shadows , grunting and mumbling drunkenly as they faced the girl . " Get out of here ! " she snapped , anger and fear racing through her . Laughter greeted her words , and the foremost of the intruders stepped forward into the light . She knew him at once . He was one of those from west of Spanning Ridge , one of those the trader Stebb had called thieves . " Pretty girl , " he muttered , his words slurred . " Come on . . . over here . " The five crept forward , spreading out across the darkened room . She might have tried to break past them , but that would have meant leaving Rone and she had no intention of doing that . Again , her hand closed about the long knife.  | " Now , do n't do that . . . " the speaker whispered , edging closer . Suddenly he lunged , quicker than the girl would have thought after having drunk so much , and his hand fastened about her wrist , yanking it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands grasping her clothing , pulling her to them , pullingher down . She fought back wildly , striking out at her attackers . But they were much stronger than she and they were hurting her . Then something within her seemed to snap as surely as had the latch on the tack room door when broken . Her thoughts scattered , and everything she was disappeared in a flash of blindinganger . What happened next was all instinct , hard and quick . She sang , the wishsong a new and different sound than any that had gone before . It filled the shadowed room with a fury that whispered of death and mindless destruction . Her attackers staggeredback from the Valegirl , eyes and mouths widening in shock and disbelief , and hands coming up to cover their ears . They doubled over in agony as the wishsong penetrated their senses and crushed in about their minds . Madness rang in its call , frenzy and hurt so bitter it could almost be seen . The five from west of Spanning Ridge were smothered in the sound . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had brought them in . From their open mouths , shrieks came back in answer to the Valegirl 's song . Still she did not stop . Her fury was so complete that reason could find no means tO stem it . The wishsong rose , and the animals in the stable kicked and slammed wildly against their stalls , crying out their pain as the girl 's voice ripped at them . Then the five at last found the open doorway and stumbled from the tack room in maddened desperation , curled over like broken things , shaking and whimpering . Blood ran from their mouths , from their ears , and from their noses . Hands covered their faces , the fingers knotted into claws . Brin saw them anew in that instant as the blindness of her fury left her . She also saw the trader Stebb appear suddenly from the darkness as the intruders ran past , a look of horror in his face as he , too , stopped and backed away , hands held frantically before him . Reason returned in a rush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , shades ... " she cried softly and collapsed in stricken disbelief . Midnight came and went . The trader had left her alone again and gone back to the comfort and sanity of his own lodgings , his eyes frightened and haunted . In the darkness of the forest clearing that sheltered the Rooker Line Trading Center , all was still . She sat curled close to the iron stove . Fresh wood burned in it , snapping and sparking in the silence . She sat with her legs drawn up against her chest , her arms wrapped about them like a child lost in thought . But her thoughts were dark and filled with demons . Fragments of Allanon 's words lay scattered in those thoughts , whispering of what she had for so long refused to hear . The wishsong is power  --  power like nothing I have ever seen . It will protect you . It will see you safely through your quest . It will destroy the Ildatch . Or destroy me , she answered back . Or destroy those about me . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , cramped and aching from the position she had held for so long , her dark eyes glistening with fear . She stared through the grated door of the iron stove , watching the red glare of the flames as they danced within . She might have killed those five men from west of Spanning Ridge , she thought despairingly . She would have killed them , perhaps , had they not found the door . Her throat tightened . What was to prevent that from happeningthe next time she was forced to use the wishsong ? Behind her , Rone moaned softly , thrashing beneath the blanketsthat covered him . She turned slowly to find his face , bending close to stroke his forehead . His skin was deathly pale now , feverish , hot , and drawn . His breathing was worse as well , turned shallow and raspy , as if each breath were an effort that sapped him of his strength . She knelt beside him , her head shaking . The tonic had not helped . He was growing weaker , and the poison was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . If it were not stopped , he was going to die .. . Like Allanon.  | " No ! " she cried softly , urgently , and she gripped his hand in hers as if she might hold back the life that seeped away . She knew in that instant what she must do . Savior and destroyer  --  thatwas what the shade of Bremen had named her . Very well . To those thieves from west of Spanning Ridge , she had been destroyer . Perhaps to Rone Leah she could be savior . Still holding his hand with her own , she bent close to his ear and began to sing . Softly , gently the wishsong slipped from her lips , floating like invisible smoke through the air about them both . Carefully , she reached out to the sickened highlander , probing for the hurt he felt , searching out the source of the poison that was killing him . I must try , she told herself as she sang . I must ! By morning he will be gone , the poison spread all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the body . Allanon had said it was so . Perhaps , then , the Elven magic can find a means to heal . She sang , sweet and lingering tones that wrapped the highlanderclose about and brought him to her . Slowly , he began to cease his shivering and thrashing and to become still beneath the calming sound . He slipped down into the blankets , his breathing growing steadier and stronger . The minutes slipped away with agonizing slowness as the Valegirlsang on and waited for the change she somehow sensed must come . When at last it did , it came so suddenly that she nearly lost control of what she was about . From the ravaged , wasted body of Rone Leah , the poison of the Jachyra lifted in a red mist  --  dissipating out of the unconscious highlander to float above him , swirling wickedly in the dim light of the oil lamp . Hissing , it hung above its victim for an instant as Brin interposed the magic of the wishsong between its touch and the body of Rone Leah . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed beside her , sweat bathed the face of the Prince of Leah . The drawn and haggard look was gone , and the breathing was steady and even once more . Brin stared down at him through a veil of tears as the wishsong died into silence . I have done it , she cried softly . I have used the magic for good . Savior this time  --  not destroyer . Still kneeling beside him , she buried her face in the warmth of his body , her arms holding him close . In moments , she was asleep.  |p294T  hey stayed on for two days at the Rooker Line Trading Center , waiting for Rone to regain strength enough to resumethe journey east . The fever was gone by morning and the highlander was resting comfortably , but he was still entirely too weak to attempt to travel . So Brin asked permission of the trader Stebb to keep the use of the tack room for one day more , and the trader agreed . He provided them with food for their meals , rations of ale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers of payment . He was happy to be of help to them , he assured the Valegirl . But he was uneasy in her presence and he never quite managed to let his eyes meet hers . Brin understood well enough what was happening . The trader was a kind and decent man , but now he was frightened of her and of what she might do to him if he refused it . He would probably have helped her out of his basic generosity , but fear had added urgency to his impulse . He obviously felt that this was the quickest and most expedient way to get her out of his life . She remained for the most part within the confines of the little tack room with Rone , seeing to his needs and talking with him of what had befallen them since the death of Allanon . Talkingabout it seemed to help ; while both were still stunned by what had happened , the sharing of their feelings brought forth a common determination that they must go forward to complete the quest that the Druid had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger and more certain in its purpose . With the death of.Allanon , they now had only each other upon whom to rely and each felt new value in the other 's presence . Alone together in the solitude of their tiny room at the rear of the trader 's stables , they spoke in hushed tones of the choices that had been made to bring them to this point in their lives andp295of those that must yet be made . Slowly , surely , they bound themselves as one . Yet despite their binding together in spirit and cause , there remained some things of which Brin could not bring herself to speak , even to Rone Leah . She could not tell him of the blood that Allanon had taken from his own ravaged body to place upon her  --  blood that in some way was meant to pledge her to him , even in death . Nor could she tell Rone of the uses to which she had put the wishsong  --  once in fury to destroy human life , a second time in desperation to save it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlander  --  in part because she did not fully understand them , in part because the implications frightenedher so greatly that she was not sure she wanted to . The blood oath was too remote in purpose now for her to dwell upon , and the uses of the wishsong were the result of emotions that she promised herself she would not let get away from her again . There was another reason for not speaking to Rone of these things . The highlander was troubled enough as matters stood by the loss of the Sword of Leah  --  so troubled , in fact , that he could seem to think of little else . He meant to have the sword back again , he told her over and over . He would search it out and reclaim it whatever the cost . His insistence frightened her , for he seemed to have bound himself to the sword with such need that it was as if the weapon had somehow become a part of him . Without it , she guessed , the highlander did not believe that he could survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must surely be lost . All the while she listened to him talk of this and thought about how deeply he seemed now to depend on the magic of the blade , she pondered as well her own dependence on the wishsong . It was just a toy , she had always told herself  --  but that was a lie . It was anything but a toy ; it was magic every bit as dangerous as that contained in the missing Sword of Leah . It could kill . It was , in fact , what her father had always said  --  a birthright that she would have been better off without . Allanon had warned her as he lay dying : " The power of the wishsong is like nothing I have ever seen . " The words whispered darkly as she listened to Rone . Power to heal ; power to destroy  --  she had seen them both . Must she be as dependent on the magic as Rone nowp296seemed to be ? Between her and the Elven magic , which was to be master ? Her father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , she knew . He had fought it when he had struggled to overcome his inability to master the power of the magic contained within the Elfstones . He had done so , survived the staggering forces it had unleashed within him , and then cast it aside forever . Yet his brief use of the power had exacted its price  --  a transmutation of the magic from the Elfstones to his children . So now , perhaps , the battle must be fought yet another time . But what if this time the power could not be controlled ? The second day drifted into night . The Valegirl and the highlanderate the meal brought to them by the trader and watched the darkness deepen . When Rone had grown weary and rolled into his blankets to sleep , Brin slipped out into the cool autumn night to breathe smells that were sharp and clean and to lose herself for a time in skies grown bright with a crescent moon and stars . On her way past the trading center , she caught sight of the trader as he sat smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilted against the rail . No one had come by for drinks or talk that evening , so he sat alone . Quietly , she walked over to him . " Evening , " he greeted hastily , sitting forward a bit too quickly in the chair , almost as if he were poised to flee . Brin nodded . " We will be leaving in the morning , " she informedhim and thought she detected a look of immediate relief in his dark eyes . " But I wanted to thank you first for your help . " He shook his head . " No need . " He paused , brushing back his thinning hair . " I 'll see to it that you have some supplies to get you through the first few days or so . " Brin did n't argue . It was pointless to do anything other than simply to accept what was offered . " Would you have an ash bow ? " she asked , thinking suddenly of Rone . " One that could be used for hunting when we . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a matter of fact . " The trader was on his feet at once . He ducked through the doorway leading into the center and emerged a moment later with a bow and quiver of arrows . " You take these , " he pressed . " No charge , of course . Good , solid weapons . Belong to you , anyway , since they were dropped by those fellows you chased off . " He caught him/self , and cleared his throat self-consciously . " Anyway , you take them , " he finished . He set them down in front of her and dropped back into hischair , fingers drumming nervously on the wooden arm . Brin picked up the bow and arrows . " They do n't really belong to me , you know , " she said quietly . " Especially not because of ... what happened . " The trader looked down at his feet . " Do n't belong to me , either . You take them , girl . " There was a long silence . The trader stared past her resolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know anything of the country east of here ? " she asked him . He kept his eyes turned away . " Not much . It 's bad country . " " Is there anybody who might know ? " The trader did n't answer . " What about the woodsman who was here the other night ? " " Jeft ? " The trader was silent for a moment . " I suppose . He 's been a lot of places . " " How would I find him ? " she pressed , growing increasingly uncomfortable with the man 's reticence . The trader 's brows knitted . He was thinking about what answerhe should give her . Finally , he looked directly at her . " You do n't mean him any harm , do you , girl ? " Brin stared at him sadly for a moment , then shook her head . " No , I do n't mean him any harm . " The trader studied her a moment , then looked away . " He 's a friend , you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's got a camp a few miles downriver , south bank . " Brin nodded . She started to turn away , then stopped . " I am the same person I was when you helped me that first night , " she said quietly . Leather boots scuffed against the wooden planks of the porch . " Maybe it just do n't seem that way to me , " came the response . Her mouth tightened . " You do n't have to be afraid of me , you know . You really do n't . " The boots went still and the trader looked down at them . " I 'm not afraid , " he said , his voice low . She waited a moment longer , searching futilely for something more to say , then turned and walked into the dark.  |p298The  following morning , shortly after daybreak , Brin and Rone departed the Rooker Line Trading Center for the country that lay east . Carrying foodstuffs , blankets , and the bow supplied by the trader , they bade the anxious man farewell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm day that greeted them . As they made their way downriver along the south bank of the Chard Rush , the air was filled with the sounds of forest life and the smell of drying leaves . A west wind blew gently out of the distant Wolfsktaag , and leaves drifted earthward in lazy spirals to lie thick upon the forest ground . Through the trees , the land ahead could be seen to run on in a gentle sloping of rises and vales . Squirrels and chipmunks scattered and darted away at the sound of their approach , interrupted in their preparations for a winter that seemed far distant from this day . At midmorning , Valegirl and highlander paused to rest for a time , sitting side by side on an old log , hollowed out and wormeatenwith age . In front of them , barely a dozen yards distant , the Chard Rush flowed steadily eastward into the deep Anar ; in its grasp , deadwood and debris that was washed down from out of the high country twisted and turned in intricate patterns . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really gone , " Rone said after a time , eyes gazing out across the river . Brin did n't have to ask whom he meant . " For me , too , " she acknowledged softly . " I sometimes think that he really is n't gone at all  --  that I was mistaken in what I saw  --  that if I am patient , he will come back , just as he always has . " " Would that be so strange ? " Rone mused . " Would it be so surprising if Allanon were to do exactly that ? " The Valegirl looked at him . " He is dead , Rone . " Rone kept his face turned away , but nodded . " I know . " He was quiet for a moment before continuing . " Do you think that there was anything that could have been done to save him , Brin ? " He looked at the girl then . He was asking her if there was anything that he could have done . Brin 's smile was quick and bitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to die ; he was told that he would not complete this quest . He had accepted the inevitability of that , I think . " Rone shook his head . " I would not have done so . "  | " Nor I , I suppose , " Brin agreed . " Perhaps that was why he chose to tell us nothing of what was to happen . And perhaps his acceptance is something we can not hope to understand , because we could never hope to understand him . " The highlander leaned forward , his arms braced against his outstretched legs . " So the last of the Druids disappears from the land , and there is no one left to stand against the walkers except you and me . " He shook his head hopelessly . " Poor us . " Brin glanced down self-consciously at her hands , folded in her lap before her . She remembered Allanon touching her foriead with his blood as he lay dying and she shivered with the memory . " Poor us , " she echoed softly . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey east . Barely an hour later , they crossed a shallow , gravelbottomedstream that meandered lazily away from the swifter flow of the main channel of the Chard Rush back along a worn gully . They caught sight of a single-room cabin that sat back in among the forest trees . Built from hand-cut logs laid crosswise and caulked with mortar , the little home was settled in a clearing upon a small rise that formed a threshold to a series of low hills sloping gently away into the forest . A handful of sheep and goats and a single milk cow grazed in the timber behind the cabin . At the sound of their approach , an aged hunting dog rose from his favorite napping spot next to the cabin stoop and stretched contentedly . The woodsman Jeft stood at the far side of the little clearing , stripped to the waist as he cut firewood . With a sure , practiced swing downward of the long-handled axe , he split the piece of timber that stood upright on the worn stump that served as a chopping block . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloven halves before pausing in his work to watch his visitors approach . Lowering the axe-head to the stump , he rested his gnarled hands on the smooth butt of the handle and waited . " Morning , " Brin greeted as they came up to him . " Morning , " the woodsman replied , nodding . He seemed not at all surprised that they were there . He glanced at Rone . " Feelinga bit better , are you ? " " Much , " Rone answered . " Thanks in part to you , I 'm told . " The woodsman shrugged , the muscles on his powerful body knotting . He gestured toward the cabin . " There 's drinking waterp300on the stoop in that bucket . I bring it fresh from the hills in back each day . " He led them down to the cabin porch and the promised bucket . All three took a long drink . Then they seated themselves on the stoop , and the woodsman produced pipe and tobacco . He offered the pouch to his guests , but they declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to smoke . " Everything fine back at the trading center ? " he asked casually . There was a long silence . " I heard about what happened the other night with that bunch from Spanning Ridge country . " His eyes shifted slowly to Brin . " Word has a way of getting around a lot quicker than you 'd think out here . " The Valegirl held his gaze , ignoring her discomfort . " The trader told us where to find you , " she informed him . " He said you might be able to help us . " The woodsman puffed on the pipe . " In what way ? " " He told us that you know as much as anyone about this coun-try . " " I 've been out here a long time , " the man agreed . Brin leaned forward . " We are already in your debt for what you did to help us back at the trading center . But we need your help again . We need to find a way through the country that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sharply , then slowly removed the pipe from between his teeth . " East of here ? You mean Darklin Reach ? " Both Valegirl and highlander nodded . The woodsman shook his head doubtfully . " That 's dangerous country . No one goes into Darklin Reach if they can avoid it . " He glanced up . " How far in do you plan to go ? " " All the way , " Brin said quietly . " And then into Olden Moor and the Ravenshorn . " " You 're mad as jays , " the woodsman announced matter-offactlyand knocked the ashes from the pipe , grinding them into the earth with his boot . " Gnomes and walkers and worse own that country . You 'll never come out alive . " There was no reply . The woodsman studied their faces in turn , rubbed his bearded chin thoughtfully , and finally shrugged . " Guess you 've got your own reasons for doing this , and it 's none of my business what they are . But I 'm telling you here andp301now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest mistakeyou 'll ever make . Even the trappers stay clear of that country . Men disappear up there like smoke  --  gone without a trace . " He waited for a reply . Brin glanced briefly at Rone and then back at the woodsman once more . " We have to go . Can you help us ? " " Me ? " The woodsman grinned crookedly and shook his head . " Not me , girl . Even if I was to go with you  --  which I wo n't , ' cause I like living  --  I 'd be lost myself after the first day or so . " He paused , studying them shrewdly . " I suppose you 're set on this ? " Brin nodded wordlessly , waiting . The woodsman sighed . " Maybe there 's someone else who can help you then  --  if you 're sure this is what you want . " He blew sharply through the stem of his pipe to clean it , then folded his arms across his broad chest . " There 's an old man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive . Have n't seen him for almost two years , so I ca n't be sure if he 's even there anymore . Two years ago , though , he was living up around a rock formation called Hearthstone that sits right in the middle of Darklin Reach  --  formation that looks just like a big chimney . " He shook his head doubtfully . " I can give you directions , but the trails are n't much . That 's wild country ; hardly anything human living that far east that is n't Gnome . " " Do you think he would help us ? " Brin pressed anxiously . The woodsman shrugged . " He knows the country . He 's lived there all his life . Does n't bother coming out more than once a year or so  --  not even that the last two . Stays alive somehow in that jungle . " The heavy brows lifted . " He 's an odd duck , old Cogline . Crazier than a fish swimming through grass . He might be more trouble than help to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brin assured him . " Maybe . " The woodsman looked her over carefully . " You 're a pretty thing to be wandering off into that country , girl  --  even with your singing to protect you . There 's more than thieves and cowards out there . I 'd think on this before you go any further with it . " " We have thought . " Brin came to her feet . " We 're decided . " The woodsman nodded . " You 're welcome to take with you all the water you can carry , then . At least you wo n't die of thirst . "  |p302He  helped them refill their water pouches , carrying a fresh bucket of water from the spring that ran down out of the hills behind his cabin , then took several minutes more to give them the directions they needed to reach Hearthstone , scratching a crude map in the earth before the stoop . " Look after yourselves , " he admonished , offering each a firm handshake . With a final word of farewell , Brin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly from the little cabin into the trees . Behind them , the woodsman stood watching . It was clear from the look on his bearded face that he did not expect to see them pass that way again.  |p303They  journeyed through that day and the next , following the twists and turns of the Chard Rush as it wound steadily deeper through the forests of the Anar and crossed into Darklin Reach . Rone was gaining in strength , but he had not yet fully recovered , and progress was slow . After a brief meal on the second evening , he went directly to sleep . Brin sat before the fire , staring into the flames . Her mind was still filled with unhappy memories and dark thoughts . Once , before she felt herself growing sleepy , it seemed that Jair was with her . Unconsciously , she looked up , seeking him . But there was no one there , and logic told her that her brother was far away , indeed . She sighed , banked the fire , and crawled into her blankets . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day followingtheir departure from the Rooker Line Trading Center that Brin and Rone caught sight of a singular rock formation that loomed blackly in the distance and knew that they had found Hearthstone . Hearthstone was a dark , clear silhouette against the changing colors of autumn , its rugged pinnacle dominating the shallow , wooded valley over which it stood watch . Chimneylike in appearance , the formation was a mass of weathered stone carved by nature 's fine hand and shaped with the passing of the years . Silence hung starkly over its towering shadow . Solitary and enduring , it beckoned compellingly from out of the dark sea of the vast , sprawling forestland of Darklin Reach . Standing at the crest of a ridge , staring out across the land , Brin felt its unspoken whisper call out through her weariness and her uncertainty and experienced an unexpected sense of peace . Another leg of the long trek east was almost over . Thep304memories of what she had endured to reach this point and the warnings of what yet lay ahead were strangely distant now . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by surprise . Then , touching his arm gently , she started downward along the shallow valley slope . The barely discernible line of a trail snaked down through the wall of the great trees . As the sun moved steadily toward the western horizon , the forest closed about them once more . They picked their way carefully over fallen logs and around jagged rock formations until the thickly grown slope leveled off at its base . Within the forested canopy of the valley , the pathway broadened and then disappeared altogether as the dense scrub brush and fallen timber began to thin . Warm afternoon sunlight flooded softly through the cracks and chinks of the interwoven branches overhead and lighted the whole of the darkened woodland . Dozens of wide , pleasant little clearings pocketed the valley forest and lent a feeling of space and openness . The earth grew soft and loose , free from rock and carpeted with a layer of small twigs and leaves that rustled gently as the Valegirl and the highlanderwalked across them . There was a sense of comfort and familiarity to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , and Brin Ohmsford found herself thinking of Shady Vale . The life sounds , insect and animal , the brief traces of movement through the trees , sudden and furtive , even the warm , fresh smell of the autumn woods  --  all were similar to that distant Southland village . There was no Rappahalladran , yet there were dozens of tiny streams meandering lazily across their path . The Valegirl breathed deeply . No wonder the woodsman Cogline had chosen this valley for his home . The travelers passed deeper into the forest , and time slipped slowly from them . Now and again they caught brief glimpses of Hearthstone through the webbing of the dark forest limbs , its towering shadow black against the blue of the sky , and they pointed themselves toward it . They walked in silence , worn and anxious to be done with the day 's long march , their thoughts concentrated on the terrain ahead and the sounds and sights of the forest . At last Rone Leah came to a stop , one hand fastening guardedlyon Brin 's arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked quietly , after listening for a moment . Brin nodded . It was a voice  --  thin , almost inaudible , but clearly human . They waited a moment , gauging its direction , then began walking toward it . The voice disappeared for a time , then returned , louder , almost angry . Whoever was speaking was directly ahead . " You had better show yourself and right now ! " The voice was high and strident . " I 've no time for games ! " There was some muttering and cursing , and the Valegirl and the highlander looked at each other questioningly . " Come out , come out , come out ! " the voice shrilled , then trailed off in an angry murmur . " Should have left you back on the moor ... if it was n't for my kind heart ... " There was more cursing , and the sound of someone crashing through the underbrush reached their ears . " I 've a few tricks myself , you know ! I 've got powders to blow the ground right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in knots ! Think you know so much , you . . . Let 's see you climb a rope ! Let 's see you do that ! Let 's see you do anything besides cause me trouble ! How would you like me to leave you here ? How would you like that ? Would n't think yourself so smart then , I 'll wager ! Now get out here ! " Brin and Rone stepped through the screen of trees and brush blocking their view and found themselves at the edge of a small clearing with a wide , still pond at its center . Across from them , crawling aimlessly about on his hands and knees was an old man . He scrambled to his feet at the sound of their approach . " Ha ! So you 've decided ... ! " He stopped short as he saw them . " Who are you supposed to be ? No , never mind who you are . It does n't make a twig 's difference . Just get out of here and go back to wherever it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dismissive gesture and resumed crawling along the forest 's edge , his skeletal arms groping left and right , his thin , hunched body like a twisted bit of deadwood . Great tufts of ragged white hair and beard hung down about his shoulders , and his green-colored clothes and half-cloak were tatteredand worn . The Valegirl and the highlander stared blankly at him and then at each other . " This is ridiculous ! " the old man stormed , directing his wrath at the silent trees . Then he looked around and saw that thep306travelers were still there . " Well , what are you waiting for ? Get out of here ! This is my house , and I did n't invite you ! So get out , get out ! " " This is where you live ? " Rone asked , glancing about doubtfully . The old man looked at him as if he were an idiot . " Did n't you just hear me say so ? What else do you think I 'd be doing here at this hour ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man should be in his home at this hour ! " the other continued in something of a scolding tone . " As a matter of fact , what are you doing here ? Do n't you have homes of your own to go to ? " " We 've come all the way from Shady Vale in the Southland . " Brin tried to explain , but the old man just stared blankly at her . " It 's below the Rainbow Lake , several days ' ride . " The old man 's expression never changed . " Anyway , we 've come here looking for someone who .. . " No one here but me . " The old man shook his head firmly . ' Except for Whisper , and I ca n't find him . Where do you think . . . ? " He trailed off distractedly , turning again from them as if to resume his hunt for whoever it was that was missing . Brin glanced doubtfully at Rone . " Wait a minute ! " she called after the old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this man . He told us he lived here . He said that his name was Cogline . " The old man shrugged . " Never heard of him . " " Well , maybe he lives in some other part of the valley . Maybe you could tell us where we might ... " " You do n't listen very well , do you ? " the other interrupted irritably . " Now I do n't know where it is that you come from  --  do n't care either  --  but I 'll wager you do n't have strange people running around your home , do you ? I 'll wager you know everyoneliving there or visiting there or whatever ! So what makes you think it 's any different with me ? " " You mean this whole valley is your home ? " Rone demanded incredulously . " Of course it 's my home ! I just told you that half a dozen different times ! Now get out of it and leave me in peace ! "  |p307He  stamped one sandaled foot vehemently and waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stood there . " This is Hearthstone , is n't it ? " Rone pressed , growing a bit angry with this cantankerous oldster . The fellow 's thin jaw stiffened resolutely . " What if it is ? " " Well , if it is , there is a man living here by the name of Cogline  --  orat least there was up until two years ago . He 'd been living here for years before that , we were told . So if you 've been out here for any length of time , you ought to know something about him ! " The old man was silent fora moment , his craggy brows tight ening in thought . Then he shook his wispy head firmly . " Told you before , I never heard of him . No one around here with that name now or any other time . No one . " But Brin had seen something in the old man 's eyes . She took a step closer to him and stopped . " You know the name , do n't you ? Cogline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ground . " Maybe I do and maybe I do n't . In any case , I do n't have to tell you ! " Brin pointed . " You 're Cogline , are n't you ? " The old man erupted in a violent fit of laughter . " Me ? Cogline ? Ha-ha , now would n't that be something ! Oh , I would be talented , indeed ! Ha-ha , now that 's funny ! " Valegirl and highlander stared at him in amazement as he doubledover sharply and fell to the ground , laughing hysterically . Rone took Brin by the arm and turned her toward him . " For cat 's sake , Brin  --  this old man 's crazy ! " he whispered . " What did you say ? Crazy am I ? " The oldster was back on his feet , his weathered face flushed with anger . " I ought to show you just how crazy ! Now you get out of my house ! I did n't want you here in the first place , and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't mean any harm , " a flustered Rone tried to apologize . " Get out , get out , get out ! I 'll turn you into puffs of smoke ! I 'll set fire to you and watch you burn . I 'll . . . I 'll ... " He was jumping up and down in uncontrollable fury , his bony hands knotted tightly into fists , his tufted white hair flying wildly in all directions . Rone came forward to calm him.  | " Stay away from me ! " the other fairly shrieked , one thin arm pointing like a weapon . The highlander stopped at once . " Stay back ! Oh , where 's that stupid . . . ! Whisper ! " Rone glanced about expectantly , but no one appeared . The old man was beside himself with anger now and he whirled about , shouting into the forest darkness and flinging his arms about like windmills . " Whisper ! Whisper ! Get out here and protect me from these troublemakers ! Whisper , drat you ! Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to them ? What good are you , you fool . . . ! Oh , I never should have wasted my time on you ! Get out here ! Right now ! " The Valegirl and the highlander watched the antics of the old fellow with a mixture of wariness and amusement . Whoever Whisper was , he had apparently decided some time back that he wanted nothing to do with any of this . Yet the old man was not about to give up . He continued leaping about hysterically and shouting at nothing . Finally , Rone turned again to Brin . " This is getting us nowhere , " he declared , keeping his voice purposefully low . " Let 's be on our way  --  look about on our own . The old man 's obviously lost his mind . " But Brin shook her head , remembering what the woodsman Jeft had said about Cogline : an odd duck , crazier than a fish swimming through grass . " Let me try one more time , " she replied . She started forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would n't listen to me , is that it ? Well , I gave you fair warning . Whisper ! Where are you ? Get out here ! Get her ! Get her ! " Brin drew up short in spite of herself and looked about . Still there was no one in sight . Then Rone stalked past her , gesturing impatiently . " Now look here , old man . Enough is enough . There 's no one else out here but you , so why do n't you just stop this ... " " Ha ! No one else but me , you think ? " The old man leaped into the air with glee and landed in a crouch . " I 'll show you who 's out here , you . . . you trespasser ! Come into my house , will you ? I 'll show you ! Whisper ! Whisper ! Dratted . . . ! " Rone was shaking his head hopelessly and grinning when all of a sudden the biggest cat he had ever seen in his life appearedp309from out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen yards away . Dark gray in color with spreading black panels on its flanks that ran upward across its sloping back , a black face , ears , and tail and wide , almost cumbersome-looking black paws , the beast measured well over ten feet and its massive , shaggy head rose even with his own . Corded muscles rippled beneath the sleek fur as it shook itself lazily and regarded the highlander and the Valegirl with luminous , deep blue eyes that blinked and narrowed . It seemed to study them for a moment , then its jaws parted in a soundless yawn , revealing a flash of gleaming , razorsharpteeth . Rone Leah swallowed hard and stayed perfectly still . " Ah-ha ! Not so funny now , I 'll wager ! " the old man gloated and began chuckling merrily , his thin legs dancing about . " Thought I was crazy , did you ? Thought I was just talking to myself , did you ? Well , what do you think now ? " " Nobody meant you any harm , " Brin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man edged forward a step , his eyes brightening beneath the tufted hair that hung down about his wrinkled forehead . " Think he might like you for supper ? Is that what you think ? He gets hungry , old Whisper does . The two of you would providehim with a nice bedtime snack ! Ha ! What 's the trouble ? You look a little pale , like you might not feel so good . That 's too bad , too bad now . Maybe you ought to ... " The grin vanished suddenly from his face . " Whisper , no ! Whisper , no , wait , do n't do that . . . ! " And with that , the big cat simply faded away and was gone , much as if he had evaporated . For a moment all three stared wonderingly at the space he had previously occupied . Then the old man stamped his foot angrily and kicked at the empty air in front of him . " Drat you ! You quit that , you hear me ! Show yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailed off wrathfully , then looked over at Brin and Rone . " You get out of my house ! Get out ! " Rone Leah had had enough . A crazy old man and a disappearingcat were more than he had bargained for . He wheeled without a word and stalked past Brin , muttering for her to follow . But Brin hesitated , still not willing to give it up.  | " You do n't understand how important this is ! " she exclaimed heatedly . The old man stiffened . " You can not just turn us away like this . We need your help . Please , tell us where we can find the man called Cogline . " The old man regarded her silently , his sticklike body hunched and bent , his shaggy eyebrows knitting petulantly . Then abruptly he threw us his hands and shook his white head in resignation . " Oh , very well  --  anything to get rid of you ! " He sighed deeply and did his best to look put upon . " It wo n't help you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Valegirl waited wordlessly . Behind her , Rone had turned back again . The old man cocked his head , reflecting . One thin hand ran quickly through the tangled hair . " Old Cogline is right over there at the foot of the big rock . " He waved his hand almost casually in the direction of Hearthstone . " Right where I buried him almost a year ago . "  |p311Brin  Ohmsford stared fixedly at the old man , disappointmentwelling up inside and choking back the exclamation forming in her throat . One hand lifted in a helpless gesture . " You mean that Cogline is dead ? " " Dead and buried ! " the truculent oldster snapped . " Now be on your way and leave me in peace ! " ' He waited impatiently for the Valegirl and the highlander to go , but Brin could not bring herself to move . Cogline dead ? Somehow she could not accept that he was . Would not word of that death by some means have gotten back to the woodsman left or to others who lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center ? A man who had lived for as long as Cogline had in this wilderness , a man known to so many . . . ? She caught herself . Possibly not , for woodsmen and trappers often stayed apart for months at a time . But who then was this old man ? The woodsman had made no mention of him . Somehowit was all wrong . " Let 's go , Brin , " Rone called to her gently . But the Valegirl shook her head . " No . Not until I 'm sure . Not until I can ... " " Get out of my house ! " the old man repeated once again , stamping his foot petulantly . " I have put up with enough from you ! Cogline is dead ! Now if you 're not gone from here by the time I ... " " Grandfather ! " The voice broke sharply from out of the wooded darkness to their left where , in the distance , the rugged pinnacle of Hearthstoneloomed blackly through the interwoven branches of the silent trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went suddenly still . Whisper reappeared to one side of them ,  |p312his  blue eyes luminous , his great , shaggy head raised and searching . The old man muttered to himself and stamped his foot one time more . Then there was a soft rustling of leaves and the mysterious speaker appeared , stepping lightly into clearing . Brin and Rone turned to each other in surprise . It was a girl , barely older than Brin , her small , supple form clothed in pants and tunic and wrapped loosely in a braided short cloak of forest green . Long , curling ringlets of thick , dark hair hung down about her shoulders , softly shadowing a sun-browned , faintly freckled pixie face that was strangely beguiling , almost compelling in its look of innocence . It was a pretty face , and while not truly beautiful in the way of Brin 's , appealing nevertheless with its uncomplicated freshness and vitality . Dark , intelligent eyes mirrored frankness and honesty as she studied the Valegirl and the highlander curiously . " Who are you ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to know . Brin glanced again at Rone and then back to the girl . " I 'm Brin Ohmsford from Shady Vale and this is Rone Leah . We 've come north from our homes in the Southland below the Rainbow Lake . " " You have come a long way , " the girl observed . " Why are you here ? " " To find a man named Cogline . " " Do you know this man , Brin Ohmsford ? " " No . " " Then why do you look for him ? " The girl 's eyes never left hers . Brin hesitated , wondering how much she should tell her . There was something about this girl that warned against lying , and Brin had not missed the way in which her sudden appearance had quieted the old man and brought back the disappearing cat . Still , the Valegirl was reluctant to reveal the whole of her reason for their being at Hearthstonewithout first finding out who she was . " We were told that Cogline was the man who best knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she repliedguardedly . " We were hoping he would offer his services on a matter of great importance . "  |p313The  girl was silent for a moment , apparently considering what Brin had told her . The old man shuffled over to where she stood and began fidgeting . " They 're trespassers and troublemakers ! " he insisted vehemently . The girl did not reply nor even look at him , her dark eyes still locked into Brin 's , her slim form motionless . The old man threw up his hands in exasperation . " You should n't even be talking with them ! You should throw them out ! " The girl shook her head slowly then . " Hush , grandfather , " she cautioned . " They mean us no harm . Whisper would know if they did . " Brin glanced quickly at the big cat , who was stretched out almost playfully in the tall grass bordering the little pond , one great paw flicking idly at some hapless insect flying past . The great oval eyes shone like twin beacons of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal wo n't even come when I call him ! " the old man groused . " How can you depend on him ? " The girl looked at the old man reprovingly , a hint of defiance crossing her youthful features . " Whisper ! " she called softly and pointed at Brin . " Track ! " The big cat suddenly came to his feet and without a sound padded over to Brin . The Valegirl stiffened as the beast 's black muzzle sniffed tentatively at her clothing . Cautiously , she started to step back . " Stand still , " the girl advised her quietly . Brin did as she was told . Forcing herself to remain outwardly calm , she stood frozen in place as the huge animal sniffed downwardalong her pant leg in a leisurely fashion . The girl was testing her , she realized  --  using the cat to see how she would react . The skin on the back of her neck prickled as the muzzle pushed at her . What should she do ? Should she continue just to stand there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid ? But she was afraid , and the fear was spreading all through her . Surely the animal would smell it , and then . . . She made up her mind . Softly , she began to sing . The words hovered in the dark stillness of the evening , floating in the quiet of the little clearing , reaching out , touching like gentle fingers.  |p314It  took only a few moments for the wishsong 's magic to weave its spell , and the giant cat sat back on its haunches , luminous eyes on the Valegirl . Blinking in sleepy cadence to the song , he lay docilely at her feet . Brin went still . For an instant , no one spoke . " Devils ! " the old man shrilled finally , a shrewd look on his weathered face . The girl came forward wordlessly and stood directly in front of Brin . There was no fear in her eyes , merely curiosity . " How did you do that ? " she asked , sounding puzzled . " I did n't think anyone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brin answered . The girl hesitated . " You 're not a devil , are you ? You 're not one of the walkers or their spirit kin ? " Brin smiled . " No , nothing like that . I just have this gift . " The girl shook her head in disbelief . " I did not think anyone could do that to Whisper , " she repeated . " They 're devils ! " the old man insisted and stamped his sandaledfoot . Whisper , meanwhile , had come back to his feet and moved over to Rone . The highlander started in surprise , then shot Brin an imploring look as the beast pushed his black muzzle against him . For a moment longer Whisper sniffed the highlander 's clothing in curious fashion . Then abruptly the great jaws opened and fastened loosely about his right boot and began to tug . What remained of Rone 's composure began to slip rapidly away , and he tried to pull free . " I think he wants to play with you , " the girl announced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knowing look at the old man , who merely grunted his displeasure and moved several paces further away from them all . " Well ... could you . . . make sure ? " Rone gasped in exasperation , struggling valiantly now to keep his feet as the great cat continued to pull and tug vigorously at the worried boot . " Whisper ! " the girl called sharply . The huge creature released his grip instantly and trotted to her side . She reached out from beneath the short cloak and rubbed the shaggy head roughly , her long dark hair falling down about her face as she leaned forward to place her head close top315his . She spoke softly to him for a moment , then glanced back at Brin and Rone . " You seem to have a way with animals . Whisper is quite taken with you . " Brin cast a quick glance at Rone , who was struggling to pull his boot back in place on his foot . " I think Rone would be just as happy if Whisper did n't take to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl smiled broadly then , a hint of mischievousness flashingbriefly in her dark eyes . " I like you , Brin Ohmsford . You are welcome here  --  both you and Rone Leah . " She extended a slim brown hand in greeting . " I am Kimber Boh . " Brin accepted the hand , feeling in its grip a mixture of strength and softness that surprised her . She was surprised , too , when she caught sight of a brace of wicked-looking long knives strapped to the girl 's slim waist beneath the short cloak . " Well , they 're not welcome as far as I 'm concerned ! " the old man snapped from behind the girl , making a gesture of brushing them all aside with a broad sweep of one sticklike arm . " Grandfather ! " Kimber Boh admonished . She gave him a sharp look of disapproval and then turned back to Brin . " You must n't mind him . He is very protective of me . I am all the family he has , so he sometimes feels ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about us ! " the old man interrupted , shaking his wispish head in dismay . " What do we know of them ? How can we be sure what really brought them here ? That girl has a devil 's voice if she can back off Whisperlike she did ! No , you are much too trusting , girl ! " " And you are much too quick to distrust , " Kimber Boh replied evenly . Her pixie face tightened with resolve . " Now tell them who you are . " The old man 's mouth screwed into a vise . " I 'll tell them noth-ing ! " " Tell them , grandfather . " The sandaled foot stamped petulantly . " Tell them yourself . You think you know so much more than me ! " Rone Leah had come forward to stand next to Brin , and the two glanced at each other awkwardly . Whisper looked up at the highlander , yawned and dropped his massive head back onto hisp316paws . A deep , purring sound rose out of his throat as his blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valegirl and the highlander . " My grandfather forgets sometimes that the games he is so fond of playing are not real . One of the games he plays often involves changing who he is . He does this by deciding to bury the old self and start life over . He last did this about a year ago . " She gave the old man a knowing look . " But he is who he always was . He is , in fact , the man you have come to find . " " Then he really is Cogline . " Brin made it a statement of fact . " I am not Cogline ! " the old man insisted heatedly . " He 's dead and buried , just like I told you ! Do n't be listening to what she has to say ! " " Grandfather ! " Kimber Boh admonished once more . " You are who you are , and you can not be otherwise . Pretending is for children . You were born Cogline and that is who you will always be . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Try to be their friend . " " Ha ! I did n't invite them here , so I do n't have to be a good host ! " Cogline snapped obstinately , determined to have nothing whatsoever to do with either the Valegirl or the highlander . " As for being their friend , you be their friend if you want  --  that 's up to you ! " Brin and Rone looked at each other doubtfully . It did not appear that they were going to have much luck obtaining help from the old man in finding their way through Darklin Reach . " Vry well , grandfather  --  I shall be host and friend for the both of us . " Kimber Boh sighed . She faced them squarely , ignoringthe old man . " It 's growing late . You have come a long way and you need food and rest . Home is just a short distance from here , and you are welcome to stay the night as my guests  --  and my grandfather 's . " She paused to consider something more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me if you would stay . Few travelers come this far east , and even then I seldom have a chance to talk with them . As I said , grandfather is very protective . But perhaps you would consent to talk with me  --  to tell me something of your home in the Southland . Would you do that ? " Brin smiled wearily . " For a place to sleep and something to eat , I think that is the least we could do . "  |p317Rone  nodded in agreement , although not without an apprehensiveglance at Whisper . " It is settled then , " Kimber Boh announced . She called to the big cat , who rose , stretched leisurely and padded up to her . " If you will follow me , we can be there in a few minutes ' time . " She turned , with Whisper beside her , and disappeared back into the forest . The Valegirl and the highlander hitched up their backpacks and followed . As they passed Cogline , the old man refused to look at them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brows furrowed . " Dratted trespassers ! " he muttered . Then with a wary glance about , he shuffled after them into the trees . A moment later , the little clearing stood empty.  |p318Home  for the girl , the old man , and the disappearing catwas a pleasant , but very average-looking stone and timber cottage situated in a broad , grass-covered clearing sheltered by centuries-old oak and red elm . Porches ran along the front and rear of the cottage , and the walls were grown thick with flowering vines and bush evergreens . Stone walkways ran from the home through gardens that lay all about  --  some flower , some vegetable , all carefully tended and neatly draw . Spruce and pine lined the perimeter of the clearing , and hedgerows ran along the bordersof the gardens . A great amount of work had gone into the care and nurture of the entire grounds . The same care was evident inside the cottage . Neat and spotlesslyclean , the sanded wood plank floors and timbered walls gleamed in the soft light of the oil lamps , polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the walls , and bright tapestries draped the rough wooden furniture and windows . Odd pieces of silver and crystal sat upon tables within a broad-shelved hutch , and the long trestle table at one end of the main room had been set with earthenware dishes and crafted utensils . Flowers blossomed from vases and clay pots , some grown from plantings , some cut and arranged . The whole of the cottage seemed bright and cheerful , even with the nightfall , and there was that feeling of a Vale home at every turn . " Dinner is almost ready , " Kimber Boh announced when they had come inside , casting a reproachful glance in Cogline 's direction . " If you will seat yourselves , I will put it on the table . " Grumbling to himself , Cogline slid onto the bench at the far side of the table , while Brin and Rone sat down across from him . Whisper padded past them to a braided throw rug situated in front of a wide stone fireplace where a small stack of logs burnedp319cheerfully . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell asleep . The meal that Kimber Boh brought to them consisted of wild fowl , garden vegetables , fresh-baked breads , and goat 's milk , and they consumed it hungrily . As they ate , the girl asked them questions of the Southland and its people , eager to hear of the world beyond her valley home . She had never been outside Darklin Reach , she explained , but someday soon now she would make the journey . Cogline scowled his disapproval , but said nothing , his head lowered in unyielding concentration on his plate . When dinner was finished , he rose with a sullen grunt and announced that he was going out for a smoke . He stalked through the door without a glance back at any of them and disappeared . " You really must n't mind him , " Kimber Boh apologized , risingto clear the dishes from the table . " He is very gentle and sweet , but he has lived alone for so many years that he finds it difficult to be comfortable with other people . " Smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a container of burgundy-colored wine . Pouring a small amount into fresh glasses , she resumed her seat across from them . As they sipped at the wine and chatted amiably , Brin found herself wondering as she had wondered on and off from the first moment that she had laid eyes on the girl how it was that she and the old man had managed to survive alone in this wilderness . Of course , there was the cat , but nevertheless .. . " Grandfather walks every evening before dinner , " Kimber Boh was relating , a reassuring look directed to the two who sat across from her . " He wanders about the valley a good deal when the late fall comes . All of our work is done for the year , and when winter comes he will not go out as much . His body hurts him sometimes in the cold weather , and he prefers the fire . But now , while the nights are still warm , he likes to walk . " " Kimber , where are your parents ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you here all alone ? " " My parents were killed , " the girl explained matter-of-factly . " I was just a child when Cogline found me , hidden in some bedding where the caravan had camped that last night at the north edge of the valley . He brought me to his home and raisedp320me as his granddaughter . " She leaned forward . " He has never had a family of his own , you see . I 'm all he has . " " How were your parents killed ? " Rone wanted to know , seeing that the girl did not mind speaking of it . " Gnome raiders . Several families were traveling in the caravan ; everyone was killed except me . They missed me , Cogline says . " She smiled . " But that 's been a long time ago . " Rone sipped at his wine . " Kind of dangerous here for you , is n't it ? " She looked puzzled . " Dangerous ? " " Sure . Wilderness all around , wild animals , raiders  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone out here ? " She cocked her head slightly . " Do you think I should be ? " The highlander glanced at Brin . " Well ... I do n't know . " She stood up . " Watch this . " Almost faster than his eye could follow , the girl had a long knife in her hand , whipping it past his head , flinging it the length of the room . It buried itself with a thud in a tiny black circle drawn on a timber in the far corner . Kimber Boh grinned . " I practice that all the time . I learned to throw the knife by the time I was ten . Cogline taught me . I am just as good with almost any other weapon you might care to name . I can run faster than anything that lives in Darklin Reach  --  except for Whisper . I can walk all day and all night without sleeping . " She sat down again . " Of course , Whisper would protect me against anything that threatened me , so I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Besides , nothing really dangerous ever comes into Hearthstone . Cogline has lived here all his life ; the valley belongs to him . Everyone knows that and they do n't bother him . Even the Spider Gnomes stay out . " She paused . " Do you know about the Spider Gnomes ? " They shook their heads . The girl leaned forward . " They creep along the ground and up trees , all hairy and crooked , just like spiders . Once they tried to come into the valley , about three years ago . Several dozen of them came , all blackened with ash and anxious to hunt . They 're not like the other Gnomes , you know , because they burrow and trap like spiders . Anyway , they came down into Hearthstone . I think they wanted it for their  |p321seems  to know when something dangerous is about . He took Whisper with him and they ambushed the Spider Gnomes at the north end of the valley right by the big rock . The Spider Gnomes are still running . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rone cast uneasy glances at each other , less sure than ever what to make of this girl . " Where did the cat come from ? " Rone glanced again at Whisper , who continued to sleep undisturbed . " How does he disappearlike that when he 's so confounded big ? " " Whisper is a moor cat , " the girl explained . " MOst such cats live in the swamps in the deep Anar , well east of Darklin Reach and the Ravenshorn . Whisper wandered into Olden Moor , though , when he was still a baby . Cogline found him and brought him here . He had been in a fight with something and was all cut up . We took care of him and he stayed with us . I learned to talk with him . " She looked at Brin . " But not like you do , not singing to him like that . Can you teach me to do that , Brin ? " Brin shook her head gently . " I do n't think so , Kimber . The wishsong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the girl repeated the word . " That 's very pretty . " There was a momentary silence . " So how does he disappear the way he does ? " Rone asked once again . " Oh , he does n't disappear , " Kimber Boh explained with a laugh . " It just seems that way . The reason you ca n't see him sometimes is not because he is n't there , which he plainly is , but because he can change his body coloring to blend in with the forest  --  the trees , the rocks , the ground , whatever . He blends in so well that he ca n't be seen if you do n't know how to look for him . After you 've been around him long enough , you learn how to look for him properly . " She paused . " Of course , if he does n't wish to be found , then he probably wo n't be . That 's part of his defense . It 's become quite a game with grandfather . Whisperdisappears and refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not very fair of him , really , because grandfather 's eyes are n't as good as they used to be . " " But he comes for you , I gather . " " Always . He thinks I am his mother . I nursed him and cared for him when we first brought him back here . We 're so close now that it 's as if we 're parts of the same person . Most of thep322time , we even seem to be able to sense what each other is think-ing . " " He looks dangerous to me , " Rone stated flatly . " Oh , he is , " the girl agreed . " Very dangerous . Wild , he would be uncontrollable . But Whisper is no longer wild . There may be a small part of him that still is , a memory or an instinct buried deep inside somewhere , but it 's all but forgotten now . " She rose and poured them each a bit more of the wine . " Do you like our home ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brin replied . The girl smiled , obviously pleased . " I did most of the decorationsmyself  --  except for the glass and silver things ; those were brought by grandfather from his trips . Or some he had before I came . But the rest , I did . And the gardens  --  I planted those . All the flowers and shrubs and vegetables  --  all the small bushes and vines . I like the colors and the sweet smells . " Brin smiled , too . Kimber Boh was a mixture of child and woman  --  in some ways still young , in some grown beyond her years . It was strange , but she reminded the Valegirl of Jair . Thinking of it made her miss her brother terribly . Kimber Boh saw the look that crossed her face and mistook it . " It really is n't dangerous here at Hearthstone , " she assured the Valegirl . " It may seem that way to you because you are not familiar with the country , as I am . But this is my home , remember  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was little what I should know in order to protect myself . I have learned to deal with what dangers there are ; I know how to avoid them . And I have grandfather and Whisper . You do n't have to be worried about me  --  really , you do n't . " Brin smiled at the assurance . " I can see that I do n't , Kimber . I can see that you are very capable . " To her surprise , Kimber Boh blushed . Then hurriedly the girl stood up and walked to where Cogline had dropped his forest cloak on the arm of the wooden rocker . " I have to take grandfatherhis coat , " she announced quickly . " It 's cold out there . Would you like to walk with me ? " Valegirl and highlander rose and followed as she opened the door and stepped outside . The moment the latch clicked free , Whisper was on his feet , padding silently through the door after them.  |p323They  paused momentarily on the porch of the little cottage , losing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still-life . The air was chill and faintly damp and smelled sweetly of the darkened forest . White moonlight bathed the lawn , flower gardens , neatly trimmed hedgerows , and shrubs with dazzling brightness . Each blade of grass , soft petal , and tiny leaf glistened wetly , deep emerald laced with frost as the dew of the autumn evening gathered . In the blackness beyond , the trees of the forest rose against the star-filled sky like monstrous giants  --  ageless , massive , frozen in the silence of the night . The gentle wind of early dusk had faded entirely now , drifting soundlesslyinto stillness . Even the familiar cries of the woodland creatureshad softened to faint and distant murmurs that soothed and comforted . " Grandfather will be at the willow , " Kimber Boh said softly , breaking the spell . Together , they moved off the porch onto the walkway that led to the rear of the cottage . No one spoke a word . They simply walked slowly , the girl leading , their boots scraping softly against the worn stone . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest and was gone . A bird called sharply , its piercing cry echoing in the stillness , lingering on . The three moved past the corner of the house now , through groupings of pine and spruce and lines of hedgerows . Then a huge , sagging willow appeared from out of the darkness at the edge of the forest , its branches trailing in thick streamers that hung like a curtain against the night . Massive and gnarled , its humped form lay wrapped in shadowed darkness , as if drawn inward onto itself . There , beneath its canopied arch , the bowl of a pipe glowed deep red in the darkness , and puffs of smoke rose skyward to thin and vanish . As they passed through the trailing limbs of the willow , they saw clearly the skeletal form of Cogline , hunched over on one of a pair of wooden benches that had been placed at the base of the ancient trunk , his wizened face turned toward the darkened forest . Kimber Boh went directly over to him and placed the forest cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather , " she scolded gently . The old man grimaced . " Ca n't even come out here for a smoke without you hovering over me like a mother hen ! " He pulledp324the cloak about him nevertheless as he glanced over at Brin and Rone . " And I do n't need these two for company either . Or that worthless cat . I suppose you brought him out here , too ! " Brin looked about for Whisper and was surprised to find that he had disappeared again . A moment earlier , he had been right behind them . Kimber Boh seated herself next to her grandfather . " Why wo n't you at least try to be friends with Brin and Rone ? " she asked him quietly . - " What for ? " the other snapped . " I do n't need friends ! Friends are nothing but trouble , always expecting you to do something for them , always wanting some favor or other . Had enough friends in the old days , girl . You do n't understand enough about how life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced apologetically at Brin and Rone and nodded toward the empty bench . Wordlessly , the Valegirl and the highlandersat down across from her . Kimber Boh turned back to the old man . " You must not be like that . You must not be so selfish . " " I 'm an old man . I can be what I want ! " Cogline muttered petulantly . " When I used to say things like that , you called me spoiled and sent me to my room . Do you remember ? " " That was different ! " " Should I send you to your room ? " she asked , speaking to the old man as a mother would to her child , her hands clasping his . " Or perhaps you would prefer it if Whisper and I also had nothing more to do with you since we are your friends , too , and you do not seem to want any friends . " Cogline clamped his teeth about the stem of his pipe as if he might bite it through and hunched down sullenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly over at Rone , who arched one eyebrow in response . It was clear to both that despite her age , it was Kimber Boh who was the stabilizing force in this strange little family . The girl leaned over then and kissed her grandfather 's cheek softly . " I know that you do n't really believe what you said . I know you are a good , kind , gentle man , and I love you . " She brought her arms about his thin frame and hugged him close.  |p325To  Brin 's surprise , the old man 's arm came up tentatively and hugged her back . " They should have asked before they came here , " he muttered , gesturing vaguely toward the Valegirl and the highlander . " I might have hurt them , you know . " " Yes , grandfather , I know , " the girl responded . " But now that they are here , after having made such a long journey to find you , I think you should see why it is that they have come and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brin and Rone exchanged hurried glances once more . Cogline slipped free of Kimber Boh 's arms , muttering and shaking his head , wispish hair dancing in the moonglow like fine silk thread . " Dratted cat , where 's he got to this time ! Whisper ! Come out here , you worthless beast ! I 'm not sitting around ... " " Grandfather ! " the girl interrupted him firmly . The old man looked at her in startled silence , and she nodded toward Brin and Rone . " Our friends , grandfather  --  will you ask them ? " The wrinkles in the old man 's face creased deeper as he frowned . " Oh , very well , " he huffed irritably . " What was it that brought you here ? " " We have need of someone who can show us a way through this country , " Brin replied at once , hardly daring to hope that the help they so badly needed might at last be offered . " We were told that Cogline was the one man who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any Cogline anymore ! " the oldster snapped , but a warning glance from the girl quieted him at once . " Well then , what country is it that you plan to travel through ? " " The central Anar , " Brin answered . " Darklin Reach , the moor beyond  --  all the way east to the Ravenshorn . " She paused . " Into the Maelmord . " " But the walkers are there ! " Kimber Boh exclaimed . " What reason would you have for going into that black pit ? " the old man followed up heatedly . Brin hesitated , seeing where matters were headed . " To destroythe walkers . " " Destroy the walkers ! " Cogline was aghast . " Destroy them with what , girl ? " " With the wishsong . With the magic that ... " " With the wishsong ? With that singing ? That 's what you plan to use ? " Cogline was on his feet , leaping about wildly , skeletalp326arms gesturing . " And you think me mad ? Get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , get out ! " Kimber Boh rose and gently pulled the old man back down on the bench , talking to him , soothing him as he continued to rant . It took a few moments to quiet him . Then wrapping him once more in the forest cloak , she turned again to Brin and Rone . " Grin Ohmsford , " she addressed the Valegirl solemnly , her face quite stern . " The Maelmord is no place for you . Even I do not go there . " Brin almost smiled at the other 's emphasis on her own forbidding . " But I do not have a choice in this , Kimber , " she explainedgently . " I have to go . " " And I have to go with her , " Rone added grudgingly . " When I find the sword again , that is . I have to find the sword first . " Kimber looked at them each in turn and shook her head in confusion . " I do n't understand . What sword ? Why is it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that you have to destroy the walkers ? Again Brin hesitated , this time in caution . How much should she reveal of the quest that had brought her to this land ? How much should she tell of the truth that had been entrusted to her ? But as she looked into the eyes of Kimber , the caution that bade her keep watch over all that she so carefully hid suddenly ceased to have meaning . Allanon was dead , gone forever from the Four Lands . The magic he had given Rone in order that he might protect her was lost . She was alone , weary , and frightened , despite the determination that carried her forward on this impossiblejourney ; if she were to survive what lay ahead , she knew she must take what help she could find where she might find it . Hidden truths and clever deceptions had been a way of life for Allanon , a part of the person that he had been . It could never be so for her . So she told the girl and the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had befallen her since Allanon had first appeared in the village of Shady Vale those many days gone past . She hid nothing of the truth save those secrets she kept hidden even from Rone , those frightening suspicions and unpleasant whisperingsof the powers , dark and unfathomable , of the wishsong . It took a long time to tell it all , but for once the old man was quiet and the girl listened with him in silent wonderment.  |p327Whe  she had finished , she turned to Rone to see if there were anything further that should be said , but the highlander shook his head wordlessly . " You see , then , that I have to go , " she repeated the words one final time , looking from the girl to the old man and back again , waiting . " Elven magic in you , eh ? " Cogline murmured , eyes piercing . " Druid 's touch on the whole of what you do . I 've a bit of that touch myself , you know  --  a bit of the dark lore . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm gently . " Can we help them find their path east , grandfather ? " " East ? Whole of the country east is known to me  --  all thatthere is , here to there and back . Hearthstone , Darklin Reach , Olden Moor  --  all to the Ravenshorn , all to the Maelmord . " Heshook his wispish head thoughtfully . " Kept the touch , I have . Walkers do n't bother me here ; walkers do n't come into the valley . Outside , they go where they please , though . That 's their country . " " Grandfather , listen to me , " she prodded him gently . " Wemust help our friends , you and Whisper and I. " Cogline looked at her wordlessly for a moment , then threwup his hands . " Waste of time ! " he announced . " Ridiculous waste of time ! " His bony finger came up to touch the girl 's nose . " Have to think better than that , girl . I taught you to think better than that ! Suppose we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reach , right through Olden Moor , right to the Ravenshorn and the black pit itself . Suppose ! What , then ? Tell me ! What then ? " " That would be enough ... " Brin started to reply . " Enough ? " Cogline exclaimed , cutting her short . " Not nearly so , girl ! Cliffs rise up before you like a wall , hundreds of feet high . Barren rock for miles . Gnomes everywhere . What happens then ? What do you do then ? " The finger shifted like a dagger to point at her . " No way in , girl ! There 's no way in ! You can not go all that distance unless you know a way in ! " " We will find a way , " Brin assured him firmly . " Bah ! " The old man spit , grimacing . " Walkers would have you in a moment ! They 'll see you coming halfway up the climb  --  if you can find a place to make the climb , that is ! Or can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  |p328Brin  set her jaw . " We will find a way , " she repeated . " Maybe and maybe not , " Rone spoke up suddenly . " I do n't like the sound of it , Brin . The old man knows the country and if he says it 's all open ground , then we ought to take that into account before we go charging in . " He glanced at Cogline as if to reassure himself that the old man did in fact know what he was talking about . " Besides , first things first . Before we start off on this trek through the Eastland , we have to recover the sword . It 's the only real protection we have against the walkers . " " There is no protection against the walkers ! " Cogline snorted . Brin stared at the highlander for a moment , then took a deep breath . " Rone , we have to forget about the sword , " she told him gently . " It 's gone and we have no way of finding what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way again into human hands , but he did not say whose hands those would be nor did he say how long it would take for this to happen . We can not ... " " Without a sword to protect us , we do n't take another step ! " Rone 's jaw tightened as he cut short the rest of what Brin was about to say . There was a long silence . " We have no choice , " Brin said . " At least , I do n't . " " On your way , then . " Cogline brushed them both aside with a wave of his hand . " On your way and leave us in peace  --  you with your foolish plans of scaling the pit and destroying the walkers ; foolish , foolish plans ! Go on , fly on out of our home , dratted . . . Whisper , where have you got to , you worthless .. . Show yourself or I 'll . . . Yiiii ! " He shrieked in surprise as the big cat 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminous eyes blinking , cold muzzle pressed right up against his bare arm . Furious at being surprised like that , Cogline swatted at the cat and stalked a dozen yards away beneath the willow boughs , swearing as he went . Whisper stared after him , then walked about the bench to lie down next to Kimber . " I think that grandfather can be persuaded to show you the way east  --  at least as far as the Ravenshorn , " Kimber Boh mused thoughtfully . " As to what you will do after that ... " " Wait a minute  --  just ... let 's think this through a moment . " Rone held up his hands imploringly . He turned to Brin . " I know you have decided to complete this quest that Allanon has givenp329you . I understand that you must . And I 'm going with you , right to the end of it . But we have to have the sword , Brin . Do n't you see that ? We have to ! We have no other weapons with which to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration . " For cat 's sake , how can I protect you without the sword ? " Brin hesitated then , thinking suddenly of the power of the wishsong and of what she had seen that power do to those men from west of Spanning Ridge at the Rooker Line Trading Center . Rone did not know , nor did she want him to , but power such as that was more weapon than she cared to think  --  and she loathed the very idea that it could live within her . Rone was so certain that he must regain the use of the power of the Sword of Leah . But she sensed somehow that , as with the magic of the wishsong and the magic of the Elfstones before it , the magic of the Sword of Leah was both light and dark at once  --  that it could cause harm to the user as well as give him aid . She looked at Rone , seeing in his gray eyes the love he bore for her mingled with the certainty that he could not help her without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was desperate  --  yet without understanding of what he asked . " There is no way for us to find the sword , Rone , " she said softly . They faced each other wordlessly , seated close upon the wooden bench , lost in the shadowed dark of the old willow . Let it go , Brin prayed silently . Please , let it go . Cogline shambled hack to join them , still muttering at Whisper as he squatted warily on one end of the bench and began fiddling with his pipe . " There might be a way , " Kimber said suddenly , her small voice breaking through the silence . All eyes turned toward her . " We could ask the Grimpond . " " Ha ! " Cogline snorted . " Might as well ask a hole in the ground ! " But Rone sat forward at once . " What is the Grimpond ? " " An avatar , " the girl answered quietly . " A shade that lives in a pool of water north of Hearthstone where the high ridges part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since before the destruction of the old world , since the time of the world of faerie . It has the magic of the old world in its touch and the sight to see secrets hidden from living people . "  | " It could tell me where to find the Sword of Leah ? " Rone pressed anxiously , ignoring the restraining hand that Brin placed upon his arm . " Ha-ha , look at him ! " Cogline cackled gleefully . " Thinks he has the answer now , does n't he ? Thinks he 's found the way ! The Grimpond has the secrets of the earth all bound up in a pretty package ready to give to him ! Just a little problem of telling truth from lie , that 's all ! Ha-ha ! " " What 's he talking about ? " Rone demanded angrily . " What does he mean , truth from lie ? " Kimber gave her grandfather a stern look to quiet him , then turned back to the highlander . " He means that the avatar does n't always tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddles that no one can figure out . It makes a game out of it , twisting what is real and what is not so that the listener can not decide what to believe . " " But why does it do that ? " Brin asked , bewildered . The girl shrugged . " Shades are like that . They drift between the world that was and the one that will be and have no real place in either . " She said it with such authority that the Valegirl accepted what she said without questioning it further . Besides , it had been that way with the shade of Bremen as well  --  in part , at least . There was a sense of commitment in the shade of Bremen lacking perhaps in the Grimpond ; but the shade of Bremen did not tell all of what it knew or speak clearly of what would be . Some of the truth could never be told . The whole of the future was never unalterably fixed , and the telling of it must always be shaded by what might yet be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Grimpond , " Kimber Boh was explaining to Rone . " He does not approveof the way the avatar lies . Still , its conversation is amusing sometimes , and it becomes an interesting game for me when I choose to play it . " She assumed a stern look . " Of course , it is a different kind of game entirely when you try to commit the avatar to telling you the truth of what it knows when it is really important to you . I never ask it of the future or listen to what it has to say if it offers to tell me . It is a cruel thing , sometimes . "  |p331Rone  looked down momentarily , then up again at the girl . " Do you think it could be made to tell me what has happened to my sword ? " Kimber 's eyebrows lifted . " Not made . Persuaded , perhaps . Tricked , maybe . " She looked at Brin . " But I was not just thinking of finding the sword . I was thinking as well of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there were a way by which the walkers could not see you coming , the Grimpond would know it . " There was a long , anxious silence . Brin Ohmsford 's mind raced . A way into the Maelmord that would hide them from the Mord Wraiths  --  it was the key that she needed in order to complete the quest for the Ildatch . She would have preferred that the Sword of Leah , with its magic and its power , remain lost . But what matter that it was found again if it need not be used ? She glanced at Rone and saw the determination in his eyes . The matter was already decided for him . " We must try it , Brin , " he said softly . Cogline 's wrinkled face split wide in a leering grin . " Go on , Southlander  --  try it ! " His soft laughter echoed through the night stillness . Brin hesitated . At her feet , stretched between the benches , his gray-black body curled close to his mistress , Whisper raised his massive head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat 's saucer blue eyes . How desperate she had become that she must turn to the aid of a woods girl , a half-crazed old man , and a cat that disappeared . But Allanon was gone . . . " Will you speak to the Grimpond for us ? " she asked Kimber . The girl smiled brightly . " Oh , I was thinking , Brin , that itmight be better if it were you who spoke to the Grimpond . " And it was then that Cogline really began to cackle.  |p332Cogline  was still cackling on the morning following when the strange little company set forth on their journey to find the Grimpond . Muttering gleefully to himself , he skittered about through the leaf-strewn forest with careless disinterest for what he was about , lost in the shadowed , half-crazed world of his own mind . Yet the sharp old eyes strayed often to Brin 's worried face , and there was cunning and shrewdness in their gaze . And there was always a sly , secretive mirth that whispered in his voice . " Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed ! Ha-ha ! Speak with the Grimpond and ask it what you will ! Secrets of all that is and all that will be ! For a thousand thousand years the Grimpondhas seen all of what human life has done with itself , watched with eyes that no other can have ! Ask , Southland girl  --  touch the spirit thing and learn ! " Then the cackle came and he danced away again . Time and again , Kimber Boh chastised him for his behavior with a quick word here , a hard look of disapproval there . The girl found the old man 's behavior silly and embarrassing . But this had no effect on the old man and he kept on teasing and taunting . It was an iron gray , misted autumn day . The sky was packed with banks of clouds from the dark stretch of the Wolfsktaag west to the fading tips of the forest trees east . A cool breeze wafted down from out of the north , carrying in its wake dust and crumbling leaves that swirled and stung the face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn in the morning light , and the first hint of winter 's coming seemed to reflect in their gray cast . The tiny company traveled north out of Hearthstone with Kimber Boh in the lead , somber and determined ; Brin and Ronep333Leah following close behind ; old Cogline danced all about them as they walked ; and Whisper ranged far afield through the dark tangle of the trees . They passed beneath the shadow of the toweringrock that gave to the valley its name and on from the broad , scrub-free clearings of the sheltered hollow into the wilderness beyond . Deadwood and brush choked the forestland into which they journeyed , a thick and twisted mass of woods . As midday approached , the pace slowed to a crawl . Cogline no longer flitted about like a wild bird , for the wilderness hemmed them all close . They worked their way carefully ahead in a line . Only Whisper continued to roam free , passing like a shadow through the dark mass of the woods , soundless and sleek . The terrain had grown even more rugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a series of ridgelines lifted above the trees . Boulders and craggy drops cut apart the land through which they passed , and much of their progress now required that they climb . The wind was blocked away as the ridgelines drew nearer , and the forest smelled of rot and must . Then , at last , they climbed free of a long , deep ravine and stood upon the crest of a narrow valley , angling downward through a pair of towering ridgelines that ran north until they were lost in a wall of mist . " There . " Kimber pointed into the valley . A thick stand of pine surrounded a lake , its waters only partially visible within a blanketof mist that swirled and shifted with the currents of the wind . " The Grimpond ! " Cogline cackled , his fingers stroking Brin 's arm lightly , then slipping away . They passed through the maze of pine trees that choked the valley 's broken slopes , winding their way steadily downward to where the mist stirred sluggishly above the little lake . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone still , and the woodlandwas quiet . Whisper had disappeared entirely . Broken rock and pine needles lay scattered over the ground on which they walked , and their leather boots scraped and crunched with their passing . Though it was midday still , the clouds and mist screened away the light so completely that it appeared as if nightfall had set in . As she followed after the slight figure of Kimber Boh , Brin found herself listening to the silence of the forest , searching through the shadows for some sign of life . As she listened and searched , an uneasiness grew within her . There was indeedp334something here  --  something foul , something hidden . She could sense it waiting . Deep within the pines , the mist began to descend about them . Still they went on . When it seemed they must surely disappear into it completely , they stepped suddenly from the trees into a small clearing where aged stone benches ringed an open fire pit , its charred logs and ash black with the dampness . On the far side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist . Kimber turned to Brin . " You must go alone from here . Follow the trail until you reach the edge of the lake . The Grimpond will come to you there . " " And whisper secrets in your ear ! " Cogline chortled , crouchingnext to her . " Grandfather , " the girl admonished . " Truth and lies , but which is which ? " Cogline cackled defiantly and skipped away to the edge of the pines . " Do not be frightened by grandfather , " Kimber advised , her pixie face a mask of concern as she saw Brin 's troubled eyes . " No harm can come to you from the Grimpond . It is only a shade . " " Maybe one of us should go with you , " Rone suggested uneasily , but Kimber Boh immediately shook her head . " The Grimpond will only speak with one person , never more . It will not even appear if there is more than one . " The girl smiled encouragingly . " Grin must go alone . " Brin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remember my warning , " Kimber cautioned . " Be wary ofwhat you are told . Much of it will be false or twisted . " " But how am I to know what is false and what is true ? " Brinasked her . Kimber shook her head once more . " You will have to decide that for yourself . The Grimpond will play games with you . It will appear to you and speak as it chooses . It will tease you . That is the way of the creature . It will play games . But perhaps you can play the games better than it can . " She touched Brin 's arm . " This is why I think you should speak to the Grimpond rather than I. You have the magic . Use it if you can . Perhaps you can find a way to make the wishsong help you . "  |p335Cogline  's laughter rang from the edge of the little clearing . Brin ignored it , pulled her forest cloak tightly about her , and nodded . " Perhaps . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she hugged the Valegirl impulsively . " Good luck , Brin . " Surprised , Brin hugged her back , one hand coming up to stroke the long dark hair . Rone came forward awkwardly , then bent to kiss Brin . " Watch yourself . " She smiled her promise to do so ; then , gathering her cloak about her once more , she turned and walked into the trees . Shadows and mist closed about her almost at once , so utterly that she was lost a dozen yards into the stretch of pine . It happened so quickly that she was still moving forward when she realized that she could no longer see anything about her . She hesitated then , peering rather hopelessly into the darkness , waiting for her sight to adjust . The air had gone cold again , and the mist from the lake penetrated her clothing with a chill , wet touch . A few moments passed , long and anxious , and then she discovered that she could discern vaguely the slender shapes of the pines closest at hand , fading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to get any better than it was , she decided . Shrugging off her discomfort and uncertainty , she walked cautiously ahead , groping with her outstretchedhands , sensing rather than seeing the passage of the trail through the trees as it wound steadily downward toward the lake . The minutes slipped by , and she could hear the gentle lapping of water on a shoreline in the silence of the mist and the forest . She slowed and peered guardedly into the mist , searching for the thing she knew waited for her . But there was nothing to be seen except the gray haze . Carefully , she went forward . Then suddenly the trees and the mist thinned and parted before her , and she found herself standing on a narrow , rockstrewnshoreline looking out across the gray , clouded waters of the lake . Emptiness stretched away into the haze , and clouds of mist walled her about , closing her in . . . A chill slipped through her , hollowing out her body and leavingit a frozen shell . She glanced quickly about , frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharp , bitter , and **26;13990;TOOLONG shivered , a shudder apt to tear his joints apart . She held him tight , talisman of her own safety . She was aware of his maleness as she had been aware of it in their prison on Harukk , in a vague , disturbing way ; but Anuurn and home and men were very far away  --  excepting Khym , who was enough to remind her of such things though he was Pyanfar 's , and far too old . As for Tully , whatever humans felt , it was complex and alien and gods knew whether he even thought of her as female . But someone should defend him . Hilfy had known all her life that men were precious things ; and their sanity precarious ; and their tempersvast as their vanity . Na Khym was  --  well , exceptional ; and graynosedand sedate in age , whatever Pyanfar believed . Young men were another kind . One made a place for them and kept all unpleasantness away ; and they wore silks and hunted and made a woman proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , when disaster came . And they were brave with the bravery of last resort , no craft  --  no one expected slyness of males . Not when the madness took them . Not when they were young . Her Tully was clever . And brave . There had been a time kif had laid hands on her and Tully had thrown himself at them , clawless as he was . They had batted him aside , but he had tried to defend her till they knocked him senseless . And she could not reach him then . That hurt with more than the pain of the bruises it had cost . They had drugged her . And she had been helpless when they took him to question . " Chur 's all right , " she said  --  remembered to say , for he had not gone up topside yet to learn it . " Tully , she got out . " He looked at her and blinked . " Chur safe . " " Everyone . " He made a sound , wiped his face and ran his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # # # , " he said , something the translator mangled . He edged one foot and the other over the side . " I # crew . I crew , Hilfy , go work  --  Want work  --  understand . " He got himself on his feet . He wobbled in the process , caught his balance on her offered hand , then : " Bath , " he said . And headed that direction . She understood that . " I 'll wait for you , " she said . So they were all a little crazed . She felt like collapse herself and felt the dizziness a lump on her skull had left . But The Pride was close top71moving . They would be pulling out and getting out of this ; and she had undergone one long nightmare of jump in kifish hands -- shut below , trapped belowdecks , with no sense of where they went or where they were or when they would die . They were at Mkks , Chur had told her . And a host of other things  --  like a deal struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maing Tol with messages ; and brought Jik and Vigilance with them  --  improbable alliance , but a useful one . Jik 's got some piece of Ehrran 's hide , Chur had said , in the long waiting for results . He flashed some paper at her at Kshshti and she caved right fast . He 's no hunter-captain , that Jik , no way that 's all he is . He 's got connections got us out of port , used that fancy computer on Aja Jin and laid us a course that put us straight into Mkks , all three , neat as you please . We went out on our mark and by the gods we were on when we came in . Got that new engine pack back thereChur had showed her that , working the cameras aft ; and the sight of their tail assembly on the vid had sent a shiver up Hilfy 's back . The Pride had changed . Had become something else since they pulled into Kshshti . Like her . And she would have wished to see the old outlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something known and never changed . Pyanfar friend these kif ? Hilfy conjured scenes  --  things Tully had seen and she had not when Pyanfar had stayed alone in that room of kif ; and again when Pyanfar had gone in after Tully with Jik and Ehrran and all the crew but herself and Chur . So , gods , why would he even ask ? True , they had a kif aboard . Tully did not know that . The presence set twitches in Hilfy 's lip , and a shudder in her bones . The thing was down the corridor . Just a few doors down and around the bend . She sat on Tully 's bed and hugged her arms about herself , wishing as she had not wished since she begged to go to space and got a doting father 's leave  --  She wanted her home again , and safety , and not to see what she wanted now to do . Better hunting in the hills , that kind of killing . A clean kind . Find a mate . She was due that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and the sun on her back where no hani she might meet would understand what kif were or the things that she had seen . Tully staggered out again , naked . There were wounds on him that seeped blood ; bruises , bruises and burns and every sort of abuse . Shep72carried like scars . He hunted a drawer for another pair of Haral 's castoffbreeches and came up with what must be the last . " Need help ? " she asked . He shook his head , a human no . He sat down and tried with several attempts to get his leg in . He rested a bit , waved her off , hanging on the chair edge ; and finally succeeded , one leg at least . The door opened , unannounced . Chur stood there , all bandaged as she was . Her eyes widened ; her voyages-ringed ears flicked back . " Chur , " Tully said , and got the other leg ; and contrived to stand up and pull the breeches on and pull the drawstring in , with now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little we have n't seen of each other , " Hilfy muttered with a little shrug at Tully and a heat about her ears . " Him or me . It 's all right , Chur . " " You all right , " Tully said . He left the chair and reached out both hands for Chur . Chur winced instinctively ; but he did not grab , only took her hands and clasped them in his own . " Chur , good to see you . Good to see you  --  " " Same , " Chur said . Her mouth pursed in a gaunt smile , and Hilfy got to her feet . " We 're some sight , are n't we ? " " We fine , " Tully said , with simplicity that ached . He grinned , tried to stop himself , got his face into a hani pleasantness . " Chur , I think you got dead . " " Got dead , no  --  " Chur cuffed his cheek ever so gently . " Gods , they chewed you up and spat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning on the chair . " Let him sit down , for the gods ' sakes . You too . What are you doing here ? " " Got a small break . They 've got data coming in up there ; Tirun 's on it  --  thought I 'd take the chance to come down and see you while I had it . " " We 're going out , are we ? " Chur 's ears went down . " Are n't we ? " " Got some little deal going , " Chur said . " What deal ? " " Jik . We got this  --  well , we got this pay-off we got to make . Jik 's asked us to go to Kefk . He 's talked Ehrran into it . " " Gods-be . " Hilfy 's claws dug into the upholstery and she retracted them . Fear . Stark fear . She knew it in herself , that flinchings had been set into her , bone and nerve , forever . " What 's at Kefk but kif ? We still following this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of deal , " Chur said . Her ears stayed at halfmast . The white showed at the corners of her eyes . " I do n't know clearly what . Captain 's back and forth with Jik . " " Go Kefk ? " Tully asked . He wobbled over against the wall and stood there holding himself on his feet . " Kif ? Go kif ? " " What deal ? " " Jik 's deal , " Chur said . " Hilfy  --  we bribed you out . I do n't know what 's up , but it 's certain we 've got trouble on our tail and we 're clearingout of here to lead Akkhtimakt off Mkks in the likely case he comes this way . We got two kif headed for a showdown at Kefk and Jik 's taking sides . Mahen politics . And we 're in it . " " Gods , no ! " The room went black-tunneled . She thrust the chair skidding on its track and headed doorward , dodged Chur 's hand . " Hilfy  --  " Chur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tully 's , that cracked and broke . " In a mahen hell , " Hilfy said to everything in reach , and headed for the lift . " We got Ehrran agree , " Jik 's terse message had said , scantly after Jik could have gotten back to his ship and put the call through . ( " Good gods , " Haral muttered then . " What kind of blackmail 's he using ? " ) " Must be good  --  "  --  from Tirun . ) And straightway from Jik : " We got hakkikt send comp feed , lot interesting stuff We run through library . You take , we make check " And arriving with that feed from Sikkukkut 's Harukk : " I Sikkukkut send a gift . Kefk is not Mkks . You will discover this . We leave port in twelve hours or less . " " Aja Jin , " Pyanfar protested at once , " that 's a short turnaround . Iknow we 're pushing , but gods rot it , we have n't got relief . " " Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friend . We got problem . " " What problem ? " " Like vector on that stsho . " " Went to Kefk , huh ? " " Damn right . " " Gods be . " She raked a hand through her mane , leaned both elbows on the console , feeling the tension behind her eyes. crackle of kifish chatter andmahendo'sat , The corn kept o p a steady at the station central offices still in kifish control , but with a fewmahendo'sat speaking now from dock offices . The boards rippled systems-lightswith the feed from Jik 's Aja Jin , which was filtering Harukkp75data through its own computer and checking it against records before sending it on . " I 'd like to have a look at that comp system over there , " Tirun said . " One gods-rotted complicated son , I 'm betting , the way it put us in here . " " Better do it twice , " Haral said , " that 's all I say . Khym  --  get that thing , will you ? Help him , Geran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's gone . I 'm sorry . I lost it out of records . " " What 's one more bill ? " Geran said . Two crew down . Chur was not up to more work and Hilfy was R &R; with Tully belowdecks , while the accessible universe wanted through the com system with individual complaints . " We sue , " was a frequent note . " You gods-rotted optimist , " Pyanfar yelled at one mahe more persistentthan the rest . " Send your lawsuit to Maing Tol and I by the gods hope it gets through ! " Then she wished she had held her peace . Her hands shook and there was a hollow feeling at her gut that going hyper-ac after jump was guaranteed to do to a body . She ate concentrates , drank , and it did no good . They had to sleep , no matter what ; they all had to go off-shift and get some rest , and Jik 's communications streamed in without letup . " Gods-rotted mahe 's got no nerves , " she muttered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably had a five-course dinner . What 's he think we are ? " No one answered that . And : " Gods , " Geran muttered when the course plan and the Kefk information began to take shape . " That son 's mean . " " That 's before we even get there , " Haral said . " I 'm betting there 's more surprises in that system that kif does n't want to show us . " " Not taking that bet , " Geran said . There was no jump-point on their way to Kefk , no point of mass where three ships up to no good could come in , go dead silent and rest and sleep a while . The route was just two stars in each other 's gravitationalinfluence ; The Pride would ride its own jump field and Kefk 's pull directly in with a vengeance . Three stars , counting Mkks and Kefk 1 and Kefk 2 : Kefk was a close binary ; and that made for difficult navigation at best . " Six ships go in with Sikkukkut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We get the tailguard post . " " Alone with seven kif , " Geran said . " Gods , what a party . "  | " Beats going first . " " How much interval we got ? " " Not by the gods enough . " Haral took furious notes and Pyanfar 's comp slot spat out a paper . All she could think of was sleep , the chance to lay her aching bones on a mattress and let her mind go . . . while they sat on a kifish docksidewith a kifish strike force likely inbound at their backs from either of two enemies . . . kifish authorities at Harak or Akkhtimakt 's ships off by Kshshti . They hoped Akkhtimakt was no closer than Kshshti . Gods only knew . If an attack caught them like this , if Akkhtimakt came to Mkks before they left or got up to speed , they were sitting targets with their nose to station and no way to get up to Vin time  --  the same thing they had done to Harukk and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical reason why Jik wanted out of Mkks in a hurry . But other things occurred to her : like the chance Jik knew things he was not saying , about operations in progress elsewhere ; the absolute surety that Sikkukkut did . There is fire , hani . From Llyene to Akkt to Mkks . Even Anuurn . Even Anuurn . And Vigilance agreed to join in an act of unvarnished piracy . I surmised correctly that you would follow me , hunter Pyanfar , as soon as your ship could move . So why us ? Gods and thunders , what have we got either side wants but Tully ? And Sikkukkut gave him back . Jik could have laid claim to him . And Jik backed off . Why did Sikkukkut want us in this ? Kif in the washroom . Kif all about . Threatened lawsuits pouring in , because a hani merchant was easier to sue than a han deputy or a mahen hunter ship ; and , gods knew , the kit ' . " We just got a transmission from Vigilance , " Haral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Tell ' em eat it . " " Captain . " " No , do n't tell them that . Acknowledge . " She shifted her attention to another board where a systems check had just blinked clear . " Number two vane is clean . " She verified Tirun 's check , punched the test of number three and got back to the Kefk system data . The schematic showed armed guard stations . Three of them at Kefk . And the robot navigation beacon in the jumprange gave no inner-lanes data to incoming ships until it got a ship ID ; and if it disliked what itp77got , it would blank out entirely . That meant dumping speed early to avoid collision , and risking collision even at that reduced velocity . And without that incoming V they were sitting targets for anything those guard stations decided to throw at them . Gods , it was lunacy . " It 's sure something to run with clean equipment , " Tirun said . " I 'd gotten used to alarms . " " Huh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it clear , rubbed her right ear . The letters separated in a green haze and came back again . Not a complaint from the crew . A hani male sat over there bone-tired and working keys and grumbling in his throat in a kind of mindless reflex moan that occasionally became a mutter : poor Khym , too well-bred to swear like the rest of them , and doing a crewwoman 's job with a woman 's steady concentration , side by side with Geran . " Give me your information , " his litany ran , impeccably delivered . " I 'll get it to the appropriate officer . " And : " I 'm sorry , that 's not quite possible . " The lift worked  --  Pyanfar turned the chair half about to glance down the corridor , nervous reflex with a kif aboard and Ehrran crew on guard in The Pride 's airlock . Hilfy was coming bridgeward in some haste . Ears back . Eyes dark , when she had gotten past the door . " Aunt . What 's this Kefk business ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's direction and leaned her head back on the cushions . Nobody came onto The Pride 's bridge and used that tone to her . But Hilfy  --  Hilfy wanted latitude lately . Pyanfar gave it . " We 're going there , yes . Got a bit of business to take care of . " " Kif business ? " Her own ears went down . She saw the fracture-lines in Hilfy , the unreason . And said nothing for a breath . " Well , is it ? " " Jik 's business . Look , we got a bill to pay , niece . A godsrotted big bill . " " To whom ? " " Jik , for one . " In spite of herself her heart raced , her ears lay back , her claws jerked half out of sheaths and gouged the upholstery . " Jik . You think I got the influence to pull a mahen hunter-ship and a han deputy in here to help us bail you out without some tradeoff ' ? You 're expensive , niece . " That slapped young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ' corners . Her nostrils dilated . " What do we do , then ? "  | " What we do  --  " Pyanfar 's voice cracked , utter weariness . She waved a hand . Hilfy wavered there on her feet in no better condition . It was madness . All of them were that tired . " What we do , niece , is what we 're set to do , whatever we 're set to do . Yes , we go into Kefk . I do n't see we have much choice . Debts are being called We do n't doublecross Jik . Even Ehrran 's going on this one . Do n't ask me why . To spy , that 's gods-rotted sure . For us , it 's what I said . Debts . We got you out . Best I could do . " " We 've got a kif on this ship . " " Not my choice . " " What is , lately ? " She did not believe for a moment she had heard that ; and then her muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Hilfy backed up , stood there with her ears flattened and dismay on her face , as if she did not believe she had said it either . Khym climbed from his chair ; his ears were back ; and that was troubleon two feet . " How much territory do I give you ? " Pyanfar asked . " What are you due , huh ? " Down the corridor the lift doors had opened again . Chur and  --  gods  --  Tully both were on their way to the bridge , faster than either of them ought ; while all about the bridge there was a dire silence , whispery of leather as crew turned in their chairs . " You got some particularrecommendation , niece ? " " No . " The word got out , finally . Chur and Tully arrived on the bridge , all but carrying each other at the last . " Maybe you better go back on break , " Pyanfar said . " We 've got work to do . " " Gods rot it , aunt- " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you want to argue method with me ? " Tully pushed off from the counter edge  --  feckless , fever-crazy , wanderingbetween two mad hani . But he stopped there wobbling back and forth with panic in his eyes . So she understood then ; and had a look at the way things had been among the kif . So all the crew did . Further things she did not want to surmise . Hilfy took Tully by the shoulders and carefully set him to the vacant side , where Khym was not , back in Chur 's keeping . There was deathly silence after that , with only the beep and flash of unliving things . " Hilfy , " Pyanfar said , and sank into her chair . " Hilfy  --  "  --  hearing those beeps and the chatter of incoming printout . " We 're all tired . We'rep79not up to this . Other ships have got other shifts , crew to spare  --  Geran , put a call over to Jik . Tell him fry his gods-rotted schedule ; we 're going ofiline . Hilfy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirmish with the kif somewhere . He 'd twisted Akkhtimakt 's tail , right well . We do n't know where Akkhtimakt is right now , but he wants our hides , no question of it . Sikkukkut swears it was Akkhtimakt 's agents blew Kshshti docks to blazes and made a grab for you and Tully  --  " " Does it matter which gods-rotted kif  --  " " Shut up and listen . Sikkukkut grabbed you instead , for his own reasons . And it does n't call for gratitude . Just common sense . Akkhtimakt'sagents ran from Kshshti . They 'll have gotten back to him ; and that means we 've got precious little time . Chances are there 's one of Akkhtimakt 's spotters hovering about Kshshti system . It 's hard to find those kind of things till they transmit . And if that 's the case he 'll find out where we went the minute he skims through Kshshti system , he 'll get the whole story of what happened there before he dumps speed , and gods help them if he stays to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We think he 'll come for us non-stop . But we ca n't bet on that . We also have a report that earless stsho that just ran out of here took the Kefk route home , to spill everything gtst knows in the process , do n't doubt it . We 've got problems here , niece . " " We 're within a one jump of Maing Tol or Idunspol , for the gods ' own sakes ! What happened to getting Tully there ? Where did that prioritygo ? " " With Banny Ayhar , from Kshshti . Prosperity couriered Tully 's packet on , with a human-language translation tape , updated . If Banny did n't run into something , that packet 's already at Maing Tol . Or will be . " Her mind had trouble with trans-light figures , tired as she was . " We 're faster than we were . And think of this  --  if you 're so concerned for Tully 's welfare . If we do take him to the mahendo'sat at Maing Tol , they 'll grab him sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jik out there ? They 'd lock him up and go at him till he 's spilled everything . You want that for him , huh ? Maybe he still knows something . Maybe I 'm crazy not to get him off my hands ; but I 'm not doing that to him . It 'd kill him , after this . Hear ? They 'd never let him loose . " " You were ready enough to turn him over at Kshshti ! " Hilfy yelled , and over at her side there was a constant drone from the translating com-unit at Tully 's side . His eyes were dark and wide . " That was before , " Pyanfar said , " gods rot it , before the thing blew up , before we  --  " "  --  ended up in debt . Admit it . He 's for sale . He 's expendable if itp80gets us out of hock . That 's what you 're holding out for ! A better gods-be deal ! " " Mind your mouth , whelp ! " " Well , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , it 's not . Not  --  "  --  since that hall , she thought . Not since she went into a kifish stronghold after him . And had a look at how it was . " Not any more , it is n't . " " So we ally with them ? Risk all our lives when we 're within a onejumpof mahen space ? " " We got a debt . Like you said . And it 's mahen space . Under mahen law . Mahen politics . You want to walk into it , throw ourselves on their charity ? You want to gamble everything you got on someone else 's priorities ? " " I thought we were falling-down grateful to our allies here . I thought it was debt . Them to us . Now it 's something else . " " Maybe if I gods-be knew what it was , niece , I would n't be going along with this . Mahendo'sat go on status . You want Jik killed , do you ? Want him to go  --  and what happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Goldtooth and like us ? We got interests in this . And they do n't call for blind trust . " " We 're not a warship , aunt ! " " No , " she said . Her gut hurt . Missed meal ? Missed sleep ? Raw fear ? " We 're a trading ship without a cargo , in debt up to our noses , and the han deputy 's got enough in her files to ruin us , the stsho at Meetpoint are bound to send their own complaint back to the han  --  I do n't trust that bastard Stle sties stlen further than I can see him ; and we got a kif loose who 's got us down as number one target in the whole gods-forsakenuniverse . Akkhtimakt wants to be head kif over all the kif , and if he makes it you can make your own guess what our personal chances are . So you want to know why I take alliance with the mahendo'sat ? " " You do n't think they 'll let us have fair chance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , all our precious allies , first chance . " " I expect they 'll try . They 're good at that . But right now they 're all the credit we 've got . You want to go to Maing Tol , try to limp the long way back to Meetpoint to bail out our cargo  --  what with , niece ? Go back to Anuurn and try to argue away all the charges in the han ? WhenIp this gets back , your father 's going to have challenges ; every whelp with ambitions is going to try him , Ehrran 's going to make double-sure of that  --  and Kohan 's getting old , imp . He ca n't take everyone . That 's the way it is . " " So we risk The Pride ? "  | " That 's the way I choose . " No one moved . Hilfy stood there trying to catch her breath . There was a persistent beep from coin . " What we do , " Pyanfar said , " we take the rest we 're due . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we guard the deputy 's blackbreeched backside . And we hope to all the gods Goldtooth 's in reach . The best we can do is keep the mahendo'sat well-disposed . Sikkukkut 's only normal crazy . You got out alive . What I hear about Akkhtimakt I do n't half like . That kif 's got a real grudge against us . Sikkukkut 's only half mean  --  that 's the truth , niece . Listen to me . You want Akkhtimakt to be the great hakkikt , the one that unites the worlds , the leader the kif have been waiting for since they discovered piracy ? Or you want Sikkukkut , who at least has limits ? Maybe we have got a personal stake in this kif fight , huh ? " " So we let Sikkukkut into bed ? " The coarseness set her ears back . " We do n't let the bastard anywhere . Yes , we made a deal . It benefits both sides . " " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 've had that bastard 's hands on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick that kif could think of  --  gods know what all they did to Tully : he could n't even tell me  --  You want me to approve this deal ? " " No . I do n't . I did n't ask . " She rested her head back . " I just tried to let you know what happened . You want to ride this one out in quarters , go on . You 're due the rest . I do n't recommend you get off here at Mkks . It 's going to be real hot here in a little while . Real hot , about the time the word gets to Maing Tol and to Akkt . We 're talking about the mahendo'sat losing a star station , hear ? Or the kif taking one . And no one 's just real happy . You 're not alone in troubles . Gods know what the mahendo'sat will do or how good Jik 's credit still is back home . We 've lost any backing we might have had from the hon. All we 've got is Jik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got nothing . Nothing . Chances are they 'll double-deal us just the way you say . But if they go  --  chances are the Personage they work for goes down ; and there 'll be a new Personage . New deal . New policies . I 'm not sure we 'd like that . I 'm not sure even Ehrran would . " Hilfy 's shoulders fell . She had a look of pain . The beep from com went on . It was her station . She waved a hand in defeat and went over and picked up the earplug , pushed the button . " Pride of Chanur , " she said to someone . " Com officer speaking . " Hilfy sat down . Back turned . Got to work . " Tully , " Pyanfar said . She held out her hand and he came over to herp82chair . He gave her that blue-eyed , thinking stare . But he took her hand gently as he had learned ; and she curled her claws round his hand , not enough to prick his soft skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . It 's all right , Tully . It 's just a discussion . It 's just talk . Go on below and rest . " " I 'm crew . Scan tech . I work , " " You 're mincemeat ; and you ca n't read our boards , let alone work our controls without a probe . You want to work ? Go get some sleep . You work later . Go . " She freed her hand and gave him a swat on the rump to send him off , but Tully failed to move . Khym was standing there watching all of this . It set her teeth on edge . Her husband . This male . And an adolescent with a gut-deep hurt and gods knew what notions acquired in a kifish cell . " We all go off duty and get some rest . Sleep . Food . All right ? " A second swat , clawtips out . He did move , startled-like , and looked back at her in shock . " Get , " she said in a nononsenseway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt , " Hilfy said . Business voice , sane and sensible . " It 's Aja Jin . Captain 's compliments and he 's got a problem . He says he 's got to talk to you direct . He wo n't take no . You want to talk to him ? " " I 'll take it . " Anything  --  anything -- to maintain Hilfy 's quiet . " I can guess . " She swung her chair about . " Tully ; Khym ; Chur ; Geran ; get out of here , get fed , get to bed . Now . Move it . Hilfy . You too .  --  One other thing , Hilfy . " " Aye ? " Defensively . " Kif says Tahar 's friendly with Akkhtimakt . " ' Moon Rising ? " Hilfy 's eyes widened , " Since Gaohn . Makes sense , does n't it ? She played close with Akkukkak ; after Gaohn , where else could she go ? Vigilance is real interested . Thought you 'd like to know . " " Gods rot . Aunt " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , niece . " She punched the contact in as Haral switched it , a solid stream of mahen exigency in her ear . " Gods-be , Jik  --  " "  --  time . You got take comp feed . What you want , wait Akkhtimakt , wait Harak kif ? " " What you want , my crew loses it in jump ? " " Got no damn time this rest . I got same station authority my neck , got same want board ship . I got explain kif you want sleep , a ? " She raked her mane back and flicked her ears . Rings chimed , light and constant . " Then I 'll explain to the hakkikt , friend . You want that ? " A moment of silence from the other end . " I talk hakkikt . Damn . " " Thanks . "  | " Before sign off maybe get comp feed through . Deal , a ? " " No ! My crew 's gone the limit , understand ? No morel " " We got stsho run go Kefk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I send crew . " " Not on my deck , you do n't . No way . " " You want I come over there explain ? We got stationer trouble , got urgent request we clear dock , got big fear , Pyanfar . Got kif trouble . What I say to kif ? Sorry , hani got take nap ? " " Explain all you like . I got fall on my face , bastard . I 'm out , through ; whole crew 's going offshift . " " Got finish comp feed . " " Twelve hours . Then we do it . " " Nine . " " Eleven . " " Damn , hani , this not merchant deal . Nine . Nine all we possible got . We cover you tail that long . Listen . " " Nine , " she muttered . " Nine . " She punched the contact out , turned the chair and got up . Hilfy and Chur had gone . Khym and Geran . But Tully lingered , alone against the bulkhead door frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scared you , huh ? " " Pyanfar . " " I 'm not mad at you . I give you an order , na Tully , you move , hear ? Did I say get ? " " Pyanfar . " He stood his ground . His mouth was set , his eyes showed panic . But he stood away from his wall and came as far as the observer seat  --  came further suddenly and flung his arms about her . She hated that . But it spoke more than Tully could . She patted his head , pushed him back and looked at him . Trust . Gods knew he had no reason . " You 're a gods-be fool , Tully . " " Hilfy say you come . " " Hilfy 's another . " But it touched her all the same . And what had he thought when she left him with Sikkukkut ? What had he believed then  --  not being hani , not being kin or anything but trouble to them ? " You go rest , huh ? We take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . You do n't go to the kif . Not to anybody . We keep you with us. "  |p84She  thought things over and poked him with a foreclaw to get his attention . " We got a kif aboard . Hilfy tell you that ? " " Kif  --  on The Pride ? " " Prisoner . Name 's Skkukuk . Know him ? " A shake of his head . " No. # # prisoner ? " " Missed some of that . Sikkukkut gave him to us . That 's where we got him . You do n't be afraid , huh ? " A second shake of his head . " Hilfy  --  Hilfy  --  want # say  --  she # kif . " " Missed that too . She 's not happy . I know that . But we take care of her . " " She 's good . Good . " " I know that too . " She cuffed him gently on the arm . " They get some food for you ? " " Not want . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the arm and led him across the bridge . Stopped and looked at Haral and Tirun , whose eyes wept dark streams from exhaustion . Her own watered . She wiped at them . " Get off duty . " " You , " Haral said . " Me , " she said . " I am . " She held Tully by the wrist and headed up the gentle curve to the galley . Behind them , chairs hummed and there were sounds of switches thrown . There was activity in the galley : Geran and Khym had gone that way , and gods , she ought to have flinched at dragging Tully in there with Khym , but she was beyond it all . " Sit down , " she said to Tully , and he did that , in the nearest spot , took the cup Geran put into his hands  --  Geran 's own . He drank . " Going to have to take some food down to Hilfy , " she said . " And Chur . " " I will , " Geran said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tirun showed up and went over to haunt the counter and rummage the supplies . " Here . You need it . " Khym shoved a cup into Pyanfar 's hands . " Sit down yourself . " " Huh . " She subsided onto the bench and drank the steaming cup from both hands , set it down and wiped her mane back from her face . Coin beeped . " Gods rot , " Haral said , and took it from pocket corn . " Pride of Chanur : you got our recording ; we 're on shutdown . Is this an emer-gency ? "  | " I have a personal message from the hakkikt . I am waiting at your dockside . " " Gods and thunders , " Pyanfar moaned . " Kif . " " Do n't go , " Khym said . " Send it away . " " You can end up regretting a thing like that . " She swallowed a massivegulp of gfi . " Tell it come up . Tell Ehrran 's guards let it pass . I 'll deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . His alien eyes shifted this way and that in evident alarm . " Kif come  --  " Pyanfar signed for quiet . Haral relayed the message . " It 's coming up , " Haral said . And with a lifting of her jaw . " You know those gods-be Ehrran are going to report this business . " " I know . " Pyanfar stood up . " You coming ? " " I 'll come , " Khym said . " No sense all of us going . Just monitor from up here . Would n't want to give the impression we were worried , would we ? " " Maybe Sikkukkut 's sent to get that kif back , " Haral said , when they were riding the lift to lowerdeck . " It would solve a problem . I 'd give it with ribbons on . But I do n't have any hope . " The door whisked open . They walked out . The kif was already in the corridor , a dark shadow against the lights , arms tucked out of sight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pocket , finger curled about the trigger of her pistol . Haral 's too , she reckoned . The kif bowed as they approached . She neglected the courtesy . " Well ? " Dark , thin hands came empty from the sleeves . It was a tall one , impressively tall . A silver medal glinted on its chest , multifaceted . " You come from the hakkikt ? " " Hunter Pyanfar , you will never learn to tell us one from the other . " She looked more sharply . " Sikkukkut ? " The hakkikt spread his hands , palm outward . " Messengers are not to be trusted in this , hunter Pyanfar . And doubtless they would miss nuances . There will be a computer feed ; are you getting it ? " " Relayed from Aja Jin . Yes . " Sikkukkut lifted his head to stare down a long , soft-skinned snout . Veins stood out about it . The eyes were bright . " You have confidence in your allies . " " Let 's say our interests coincide . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their interests . " " Is this a deal of some kind ? " " I have offered gold . " " Does n't interest me . " " And you a merchant . " " Not in every kind of goods . " " Your human would not speak for me . Not a word . " " Huh . " She drew a deep breath , ignoring the ammonia smell . " I did n't try too hard . But doubtless his comrades on Ijir talked to Akkhtimakt when he took that ship . And what would they tell ? That humans are determined on trade links ... which will destroy the Compact ? Annoy the methane breathers ? Distress the stsho ? Do you see the forces ranged against you , ker Pyanfar ? Your own han is against you . You ally yourselves with mahendo'sat , and you know their mo-tives . " " Tell me them . " " To diminish us . To bring in yet another species at our backs as they brought hani to shield their left hand . On Ninan Hol there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond Ninan Hol ; they send out probes constantly hoping for some other contact they might use . They have their hands in everything . Like my old friend Keia . " " Friend , huh ? " " Our interests coincide . He wants me to defeat Akkhtimakt , disliking Akkhtimakt 's immediate objectives . I want the same , of course . So should you . " " Maybe I do . " Sikkukkut 's snout wrinkled and unwrinkled . " Kkkt . Let us assume we are allies . Remember this at Kefk . Should things go amiss , come to me . " She stared at him a long , long moment . " That what you 've come to say ? " " I find you of interest . " " Gods , thanks . " More wrinkles . " You are ingenuous . You have enemies at home . " Her ears sank . " What 's that got to do with here and now ? " " Much to do with the future . Will you sell me this human ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me . I confess to curiosity . " " I do n't know I 'll do anything . He 's crew . " " Hani perplex me . But you 've promised , have n't you ? You 'll give me Kefk. "  | " Jik said as much . Does it take a private deal with me ? " " I offer you pukkukkta on all our enemies . " " Revenge I do n't need . " " Do you not ? Tc'a sing your name . I have heard it . " The hair stood up on her back . " Fine . I imagine they gossip a lot of things . " " Pukkukkta . " The dark lips drew back and exposed keen incisors with their v-form gap ; one arm flourished outward , with a flare of dark sleeve . " Hani , there will be a day you want it . " " What by the gods does that mean ? " But Sikkukkut had turned and walked away , a diminishing blot on the light . He stopped and turned half about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out , of course . Friend . " " Tirun . We got a visitor leaving . Let him out . " " Aye , " the answer came back . Sikkukkut walked on in serene dignity and Pyanfar tautened the skin at her back to smooth the fur . Muscles resisted and turned the motion into a shiver . " Gods , " Haral muttered . " See he gets off , " Pyanfar said ; and Haral strode off down the corridorin that direction , where the kif had disappeared around the corner , headed for the lock . Her hair did not unbristle until Haral reappeared and walked back to join her . " You record that , Tirun ? " she asked of the empty air . " I got it , " Khym 's voice came back . " I was n't Mahn 's backroom lawyer for nothing . " She drew a whole breath and spat out a laugh . It was as if some thunderstorm had blown through The Pride 's corridor and the sun had come out again . But then Haral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyanfar turned abruptly . Hilfy stood there with a pistol in hand . " What do you think you 're doing ? " Pyanfar yelled . " I heard the hatch , " Hilfy said . Too quietly . " We handled it . Get back to quarters , huh ? " " Aye , " Hilfy said . The safety clicked back on . Hilfy pocketed the gun and disappeared around the corner . " Why did I yell ? " Pyanfar muttered to Haral , to no one in particular . " Idid n't have to yell , gods rot it . " " She 's all right , " Haral said . " Sure . "  |p88But  she did not get the cold of it out of her gut until she had gotten back to the bridge and into the galley . " What he want ? " Tully asked , worried-looking , half-rising from the table ; but Pyanfar pushed him down again , her hand on his shoulder . " Nothing but nuisance . " " He give money . Want me . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down onto the bench and reached for her abandoned cup . So what did he want ? Khym took the cup before her hand got there and slid a hot one into her hand . " Good , " Khym said . She looked up at her husband , puzzled . " Good , " Khym said again , meaning just , she thought , good job . She doubted it . But she sipped the gfi and looked up at him . She saw patiencein his amber eyes . Patience he had won the hard way . " Your cabin 's taken , " she said pointedly . " Huh . " He looked embarrassed at the invitation when he had realizedit . Geran was there . Another male was . Then he looked pleased in spite of himself . His ears flicked . Gods . Tc'a . Methane-breathers . She remembered the knnn that had paced them out of Meetpoint and the hair wanted to stand up on her back again . Something he said was important . Something was worth the trip here . Him . Would-be lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume we are allies . Remember this at Kefk . " Something wrong ? " he asked . Revenge on all our enemies . Hani , there will be a day you want it . " Not yet , " she said . She caught the plastic-wrapped confection Geran spun her way on the tabletop . Haral and Tirun blundered back in , hunting gfi and food . She tore the plastic and swallowed the mince in hunks , guaranteed to make for hiccups . She chased it with gfi . " Gods , tofi . " The spice made her sneeze . " Slow down , for the gods ' sake . " " What , slow down ? We 've got eight and a half hours to sleep . " She stood up and grabbed Khym 's arm . " Come on , husband . Suddenly I 'm in the mood . " " Gods , Py . " " Who notices ? Finish the gfi . Come on . "  |p89Eight  and a half hours was not enough . The alarm went off like attack and mayhem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was nothing for it then but to remember where she was and what there was waiting , and to pull herself and her half-conscious husbandout of bed and face it . She faced it in a plain twill pair of blue trousers , common-spacer-like , because they were headed out , and otherside of that jump was likely no time for washup or amenities . She saved her brightest silk pair for aftercleanupon the docks at Kefk . Healthiest to think in those terms , that there would be the need of red silk trousers and all the finery . But she did put on the ruby pendant earring , among the others , that winked and shone ferociously in the red-gold sweep of her tufted , manyringedear . It advised all who wanted to argue with a rather plainly dressed hani that she held a captaincy . On such a day she needed all the convincing it could lend . " Feed the gods-rotted kif , " she ordered Tirun when she found her on the bridge . " Feed it what ? " Tirun asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know : thaw something . Throw a steak through the door . Do n't get near it . And do n't carry weapons . " " Gods , it 's just one kif . I can  --  "  | " Do n't go near it . How much more trouble do we need on this ship ? " " Aye , " Tirun said , and swallowed all further argument . They were all up , all functioning : Chur came out from Khym 's formercabin to sit check-out on the bridge ; Haral and Hilfy and Geran arrived from below ; and Tully came up too , stiff and sore and pottering about the galley with Khym ( gods ! ) and Hilfy , getting breakfast . On the bridge the comflow started and The Pride began to drink down the information Aja Jin and Vigilance had been awake through the downwatchescomposing . Haral and Geran and Chur were in charge there , while Tirun went off to kif-feeding . " We got a request , " Chur reported , " from Aja Jin . They want conferencewhen you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fine . I 'll get to it . " " Checks are running fine . We just take Aja Jin 's course the way it stands ? " " We take whatever they give us . I 'm not quarreling with their comp . " She leaned over Chur 's seat and took a look at station output . It was mahen language again . Mkks began to have the feel of normalcy in its operations . Any kif on Mkks who valued his life , she reckoned , was headed for Sikkukkut 's ships . She thought of others of the noninvolved , non-kif , wishing they could have evacuated the entire station . But that was impossible . Mahendo'sat and stsho had to stay and trust the few conventionsof non-involvement and neutrality even kif observed in the Compact . Tc'a and chi were safe . Indisputably . And they protected the other , oxy-breathing residents by their own immunity and their insanity . C our r count ? " " Hour three minutes to undock , " Haral said . " Good gods , they 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a stubborn bastard . " " We on count ? " " We 're catching up . " She put her own board live . Ran a survey of systems and recent corn messages . From Aja Jin : You got no problem , you come in on coordinate numberone good . . . . Another optimist , she thought . " Put in a call to Jik . " " Aye , " Geran said . And a moment later . " He 's not answering . " " What , not answering ? We 're in countdown . Remind him who 's asking , huh ? "  |p91Another  delay . " Captain , his first is on if you want to talk to her . " She punched it in . " This is Pyanfar Chanur . Have we got a prob-lem ? " " This Soje Kesurinan . Not got problem . Fix good . " Unease ran up and down her spine . There was a do n't ask implicit in the mahe 's tone . ( So what for godssakes is the matter ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No need . All fine , honored captain . " " Pride out . " She punched it off . Gods , likely every kif on Mkks had access to that corn transmission . She caught Haral 's worried look . " He 's not there , " Pyanfar said . Haral 's brow wrinkled . " I 'm betting , " Pyanfar said , " he 's not aboard . Geran , get me Rhif Ehrran . " " Aye . " Geran made the call . " She 's on , captain . " That quick . So he 's not there , and Rhif 's at the boards . " Ker Rhif . Letting you know we 're back online . " " We have your count . We assume it 's accurate . " " It 's accurate . Do we have a sequencing yet ? " " Ca n't this be processed at some other level , Chanur ? Or is this a social call ? " " Just wondering , Ehrran . " She broke the contact without the protocols . Looked at Haral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the docks somewhere . " " Gods-rotted lousy time to take a walk . " " I figure he knows what he 's doing . " She got back to the messages . A Mkks consortium lodged protests . A mahen prophet babbled something about retribution and visions . A self-claimed psychic saw humans descendingon Mkks in their thousands and bringing some invention that would make antimatter obsolete  --  " Good gods , Geran , you screen this stuff ? " " Sorry , captain . That 's the good ones . We got crazier . Thought you 'd like the local temperature , huh ? " " They 're scared . Ca n't blame them for that . " She tried not to think about it . " Where 's Vigilance 's complaint about visiting kif ? " " They never logged it with us . " " Huh . " That bothered her . She bit at a snagging underclaw and watched the readout run past . Khym arrived with gfi for everyone on the bridge , regulations fractured . But it was her rule , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Geran said , " they expect us to take a lot of this data during system transit . " " They better . " She sipped the gfi and looked up again as breakfast arrived , Hilfy with a tray of rolled sandwiches . " Thanks , imp . " Hilfy glanced at her in a strange , ears-back way as if the little-girl word had jarred . Perhaps it had . Pyanfar noted that as Hilfy turned away and served the rest , with Khym and Tully . Tully 's moves this watch were full of winces . Besides the usual spacer 's breeches he wore a white , stsho-made shirt , likely the last he had . It covered the wounds . His mane and beard were combed and neat . His eyes , always light and unnerving-quick , darted and danced in a kind of desperate counterpoint to Hilfy 's quiet . He smiled . He looked happy . It had the look of desperation . Fear of them ? she wondered uncomfortably ; and then caught Tully 's look at Hilfy 's back , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through until Hilfy pricked up her ears in a semblanceof good humor -- for her , she thought ; he wore the cheerfulness for Hilfy 's sake ; and the inside-out of it shivered through her nerves . He moved like a woman walking round some man on the edge of his control . Do n't jostle , be pleasant , have your temper elsewhere . Hilfy might see it or might not . Human instinct ? Or were they tied together , one holding onto sanity because of the other  --  and Hilfy further gone than she suspected ? " Captain ? " Pyanfar blinked and gulped down a large part of the sandwich , turning to the board . " Thanks . " Data turned up . She swallowed the other half in two bites and punched a key . The nav-system engaged and ran the data . " Three quarters hour , " Haral said . " We are n't getting checkout from our friends out there . " " I 'm  --  " Geran said ; then : " We got a call from Aja Jin 's first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " There was a stir at her side . Hilfy slid into her seat and started checkout . Tully edged in next to Chur . " That 's Khym 's seat , " Chur said sotto voce . " Take the one the other side of Tirun 's . " " Captain , Jik 's on his way over here . So his bridge says . " " Huh . " Pyanfar 's eyes went to the time ticking away in the corner of main-monitor . Small alarms went prickling up and down her spine . Shep93sipped at the gfi . " Coming up on the half hour mark and Jik pays social calls . Are those Ehrran guards still on watch in our lock ? " " Had a call from Vigilance a few minutes ago , " Haral said . " They say they 're going to pull them out at the half hour mark . I gave them thank-you and told them we 'd take care of ourselves from then on out . " " Gods-rotted pointless anyhow . Gods-rotted Ehrran priggish gods-be punctilious nonsense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 're up to . Sealed lock and they 've got to set guards in it . " Pyanfar 's lip twitched . A thought came through . " That blackbreechedbastard knows something 's interesting in our downside corridor . Never mind what passes through our lock . " " You think ? " That rated a turn of Haral 's head . " Khym was on guard down there when Ehrran first came aboard . That kif Skukkuk walked up to our ship and never came off ; you want to bet no one on the dock saw that ? And that Rhif Ehrran has n't been sniffing round everyone she can interview on this station ? If she missed any of that , she heard me ask Sikkukkut what to do with the bastard : by the gods she knows . Knows about Sikkukkut coming here to talk . And she 's waiting on me to cave in and send some explanation what we 're doing with the kif , " " File 's got to fill whole banks by this time . " " Does n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She gulped the last of the gfi , looked around for someone free to carry it to the galley . Tully sat beside Tirun . Khym was rattling about in galley ; latches snapped and thumped . Tully turned wide eyes on her , blue and holding that perpetual hint of panic . " Trouble ? " he asked Chur , with a glance her way . " Explain it to him . " Pyanfar shoved the empty cup down the security-bin . " I 'm going down to talk to Jik when he comes in . " " Want company ? " Haral asked . " Sit on things here . Who 's going to do that undock ? " " Central says they 've got crew moving up . Mahendo'sat . " " Fine . " Pyanfar headed for the door . " Fine .  --  Get Tully 's drugs for jump . Tully , hear ? " " I got . " Tully patted his pocket . " But kif  --  " " Thank the gods . Brains . " " I work jump . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your back . You go to bed , hear ? And , Chur , you 're going to quarters on this , from undock out . " " Captain  --  " Chur powered the chair about and opened her mouth to protest.  | " You heard me . You 're still not sound . Have n't got time to take care of you . Do n't make me problems . " " I 'm begging you this one . Captain . I 'm going to be fit . It 's a rough one . 1 want to be there . " " Huh , " Pyanfar said . Thought about it a moment too long and shook her head . " Gods rot it , all right , take duty . " " I , " Tully said . " I work . " Another unanswerable stare , blue-eyed this time . His mouth trembledin that way he had when he had gone his limit . She remembered then she had put a thing in her pocket , transferred from yesterday 's plain trousers . She had meant to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel , like saying no to Chur . She fished it out between thumb and foreclaw and took his hand and laid it there , a small gold ring meant for human hands , not ears . He closed his fist on the small bit of gold that had belonged to some lost friend . It meant something profound to him . " Where get ? " " Just keep it on your hand this time . " He put it on his finger . Looked up again with fever in his eyes . Then he clasped her hand with a fierceness that disarranged joints and claws ; she flexed claws out in self-protection , strength opposed to strength , and he let go . " You sit this chair , huh ? " You sit here , stay steady , keep Hilfy gods , keep her thinking . Shame her into it . Do n't let her be a fool , Tully . " I work , captain . " " Captain . Huh . " Someone had taught him that . He managed it in hani , confounding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt . " Takes orders , does he ? Huh . Tully , you watch . " She walked out . The lift opened and let her out on the lower main . Tirun was in the corridor . She expected that . That Tirun waited there with her back against the wall and that trouble-look on her face , she did not expect . She slowed down , distracted from one crisis for one that confronted her , and Tirun 's ears sank further , tight-folded . " Captain . " " Spill it . " " Kit ' wo n't eat the frozen stuff . He wants to talk to you personally . " She let go a long slow breath . " Wonderful . Tell him we 'll have a long friendly talk at our next port of call . " " I told him you 're busy . " " He said ? "  | " That you were a fool . Captain . " Staring straight ahead , not a twitch of a tightly-folded ear , " I asked who was sitting in the washroom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsubtle " " You leave it the frozen stuff ? " " I left it . Thawed . I could puree the stuff . " " Kif 's got teeth . " She walked off . " Captain . I could  --  bribe a docker , maybe , well , get one of those small live things  --  " She looked back , at Tirun standing there with a revolted look . " Reasonwit/ it . " " I tried . " " Try again . " She headed for the lock , jammed hands in pockets , past the butt of a gun in the righthand one . Gods . Live food . Raw was one thing . Raw and protesting was another . She entered the short lock corridor and hooked the recessed button on the panel with a foreclaw . The inner hatch shot back unexpectedly and she glowered at the two Ehrran clanswomen on guard there , who faced her with an aborted leveling of rifles . " Who you planning on firing on from this side ? Escaping crew ? " " Captain . " Politeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their midst and reached toward the corn panel to tell Haral to open up the lock , an Ehrran arm shot into her way : " Captain , begging pardon , but it 's a half hour  --  " Pyanfar turned and looked , nose to nose with the Ehrran crewwoman . The ears wilted first , the arm dropped next , and the body went third , a backstep that got the Ehrran not quite out of her reach . " Haral . " " Aye , captain . " " Open us up down here . " The outer hatch shot back . Pyanfar heard it , felt the chill draft . She still glared at the Ehrran eye to eye . " You , " she said to the Ehrran . " You want to walk out there into the access and see if captain Nomesteturjai'sanywhere about ? " " I 'm not to leave my post . " " What ? Even if I cycle the airlock ? You 're a lunatic . " " I do n't think it 's a case  --  " "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What , captain ? " " Arguing with me . Get ! " They flinched , the pair of them ; they both flinched , and then it was too late . Pyanfar took the ground they gave , backed them up against thep96threshold of the open hatch , and it was suddenly a case of resisting a captain on her own deck or moving from their post " Out ! " For a moment she thought they would actually stand fast , rifles and all ; and her claws came out and her nose rumpled into a grin . But then one Ehrran 's foot hit the hatch-rim and threw her off-balance . The Ehrran caught herself and backed up ; the other did , and then they were both in retreat down the chill yellow accessway . Pyanfar followed in long strides , one hand on the gun in her pocket  --  it was still a kifish dockside once around that bend and into the rampway . She heard the thunder of hastening feet on the plates ; and when she had reached the right-hand turn she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mahe garishly dressed in red-striped green and laden with gold chains and bracelets and a monstrous large sidearm slung at his hip . Mahen guards , far below , held the foot of the ramp . Jik strolled up the center , and the outbound hani caught-step to avoid him and passed him in great haste . Jik stared back over his shoulder , faced forward and came on with a shrug . " What they got ? " he asked with a gesture backward . " Both ears , " Pyanfar spat . She was shaking  --  gods , she had been in dockside brawls and barfights and a set-to with her son and never lost her head like that . The peripheries around Jik refused to come clear ; hunter-vision had set in . Her ears were plastered tight against her skull and her muscles shuddered . Jik stopped just stopped , dead still and quiet . Pyanfar sucked air . Spat in the accessway . " You want something . " " You got time ? " Judiciously and from safe distance . A third spit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her vision began to clear . She jerked a hand back toward the lock , led the way , and as they rounded the turn , she saw Tirun standing there with ears flat and a pistol in her fist . " Haral said there was trouble , " Tirun said . " Over now . Get . Haral needs help up there . We got mahen guards outside . " " Aye . " Tirun went at a run . " Come on . " Pyanfar brought Jik on through the airlock into the inner corridor , and punched the corn panel . Haral . It 's all clear . Sealboth hatches . " " Aye  --  "  --  from the bridge , without comment . SSSShhhh-t . The door went . Sealed with an electric thunk . She looked at Jik . Her lip still twitched . She flicked her ears with ap97jingling of rings . " I tell you , Jik , the han 's changed . It 's changed . Mani used to go where they liked , do what they liked without some godsrottedgovernment notetaker stalking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a ? " " I think I just made a gods-rotted big one . Mistake/ When 'd it get to be a mistake to throw two lousy insolent spies off my deck ? When 'd it happen , Jik ? " " Maybe -- - " Jik cleared his throat . " Maybe you make , Pyanfar . You bring lot strangers to Anuurn . Anuurn hani  --  they not got used to outside . They scare . Lot scare , Pyanfar . They got hani renegade Tahar go work for kif You know what think ? I think this Ehrran got lot suspicionChanur got too much power " " Too much ? We got debts , friend we got debts up to our noses , my brother 's not getting any younger  --  he 'll go down one day , and gods even know if it 'll be a Chanur that takes him . My nephews are all fools . " It was too much to say . Far too much already . She shrugged and looked elsewhere down the corridor. y " Chanur got space , " Jik said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a ? " She slanted an ear back and looked at him then , this hunter-captain who was way , way up in mahen councils . Mahendo'sat had brought hani into space . Given them ships . Created , if hani ever admitted it , the very concept of the hon. And Jik understood that . He understood it very well indeed . " You longtime got your hands in every nest in the Compact , mahe  --  " She slipped deep into the pidgin , facing wrinkleringedbrown eyes , a sober , too-wise stare . " You know this Rhif Ehr-ran ? " She expected a shrug from Jik , denial , some glib answer . Instead : " Maybe Chanur enemy get organize , a ? Maybe you watch you back , friend . I make big mistake at Kshshti , bring Ehrran in this thing . Big mistake . " " I believe you , " she said . " Now I believe you .  --  What you want here , huh ? " " Want say same thing . Want make sure you not come ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one piece , hani . " " Come here . " She grabbed him by the arm and brought him down the corridor , around the corner and down again , where the lowerdecks washroom was . She pushed the button and the door shot back . The kif sat on a folded stack of blankets on the tiles against the farp98wall . Its robes were tucked close about it . It had dropped its hood . Now its head came up and it rose in one muscular glide and bowed , showing empty hands , before it looked up again . Courtesy of a killer-kind . " Is it ker Pyanfar ? " " It 's me . This is the captain of Aja Jin . " " Sssstk . " A deep nod of the head . " I am impressed . Nomesteturjai . " " Kif , " Jik said . " His name is Skkukuk . He says he 's mine . A gift , from Sikkukkut . " " A.  --  A noikkhe ? " " Skku nik kktitik kuikkht kehtk tok nif fik pukkukk. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weapon , for pride , revenge " Nfkokkth shokku hakhoth nkki to skohut . " " A , " Jik said . " Well ? " said Pyanfar . " You got kif , " Jik said , and shrugged . " I am starving , " it said . She shut the door , laid her eyes back and looked at Jik . " What do I do with it , huh ? Put it out the hatch ? " " They kill him sure . " " Well , gods rot it , do I run a charity for kif ? " Another shrug . " Sikkukkut give you crewman . Not number one important . Maybe fellow make mistake  --  " " Maybe a crewman whose loyalty 's in question ? Maybe even one off that disabled ship ? " Jik 's eyes flickered . " Maybe so . All same , he belong you . You got deal , a ? " " Gods rot , you want him ? " Jik rubbed at his nose . " Tell you truth . That give you sfik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean status with that gods-rotted kif ? Sikkukkut ? " " Best thing you kill this kif . Send same pieces to Sikkukkut . " " Huh . " " No do , a ? Maybe you turn him out naked on dock . " " So they kill him . " " He same kill few , maybe . " " I 've traded up and down docks from Jininsai to Meetpoint , and I 've never heard the like . You understand it ? What 's Sikkukkut up to ? " " I fight kif long time . Long time , Pyanfar . Kif at Meetpoint , they quiet kif . This be border . Dis-pu-ted Zone . This space no one got.  |p99Where  we go next , this be true kif space . You not see before . Not see before these thing . No hani see  --  ' cept maybe Tahar . And she lot crazy . " " You 've seen Tahar ? " " I talk with her , one time , two . She strange . Lot strange  --  " He touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and turned tail at Gaohn ; and took kif money  --  " " Hani law . " " You gods-rotted right , hani law . A lot of hani 'd like to get a piece of that ship . " " Maybe do . " " Maybe do . Rhif Ehrran was already headed for Kefk when we picked her up at Kshshti . You know why ? " " Maybe you know . " " I do n't . That worries me , Jik . " " Worry me too . " " What 's an honest hani doing going Kefk way ? What 's an honest hani know about a kifish system ? " Jik ducked his head and rubbed his nose . " Tell you , hani , few ship I know sometime maybe got rig turn off ID squeal . Sure you not know such thing . Maybe ship also got rig make fake ID to beacon . Vigilance hunter-ship , a ? Got lot stuff . Lot stuff . Also maybe know Kefk pretty good . " " Been there ? " " Stsho been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe sell in-for-mation . " " I 'll believe that . But what 's she doing there ? " " Kefk be Tahar port , " Jik said . " She hunt Tahar . Also  --  maybemaybeshe got stsho interest . Stsho business . You think , hani : stsho do n't fight . Stsho always hire guard . Who they hire ? " " Mahendo '  --  " The suspicion got through . She looked up into mahen brown eyes , murkier and darker than any ham 's . " Good gods , they count us barbarians . They would n't hire hani for anything but  --  " " Who else they got hire when got falling-out with mahendo'sat ? Hire kif ? They not fools . No , maybe all sudden they got idea hani not bad neighbor  --  maybe all sudden want make good friend with the hon. Maybe one day there be hani guard at Meetpoint , not mahendo'sat . Big advantage to hani . To some hani . Lot money . Lot stsho money  --  and they plenty rich . I tell you truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hani make problem this deal . Moon Rising . You . "  | " You put us in the same  --  " " Ehrran do . " " Gods . " She flung a gesture up , put distance between herself and Jik . Stared at him . " I tell you , you got lot enemy , hani . " She stood there a long moment . Jik made his mouth a thin , inturned line , as if more might get out . " What you do ? " he asked finally . " What do I do ? What do I do ? I ought to gods-be head out of here and leave you and Ehrran to the kif . " " You not do . " " Try me . " " No , you not do . Where go ? Maing Tol ? Han got ' nough suspicion already . Also  --  you not stsho . Chanur do n't go hide in fight , wait for thing be better , let friend die . .. " Friend ! " " I save you neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same good reason , a ? " " Gods rot you , Jik . " " I try save you now . Want you at Kefk . Need you . Need you stay ' live , hani . " She looked off across the corridor . Anywhere else . Jik 's voice was dim . Her ears lay flat against her skull . " So what do I do with the godsbekif in my washroom , huh ? " " You keep . I want you keep . He yours . He got nowhere to go , a ? You got plenty sfik he fight like devil kill you enemy . " " And if he decides I do n't have ? " " You kill him quick . He offer you weapons , a ? " " Huh . " " He tell truth . Kif truth . " Jik laid a careful hand on her shoulder . " You keep him lock up tight . A ? Later I take . I got reason . " " I 'm sure you do . " Her nose wrinkled . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned and stared up into his face . " So what 's the game at Kefk ? What 's Sikkukkut want ? He wanted me . Before you ever got into it . He got me to Mkks . What 's he want , dragging me into this Kefk business ? " " You got damn lot sfik . " " You 're crazy . " She shook the hand off . " He 's crazy . " " You got think like kif . " " I 'm sure you 're good at it . "  | " You friend . " " Friend , my  --  " " Maybe kif play same game like Ehrran . " He shrugged , hands in the back of his belt . " He kif . Kif mind got twists . One , he hate Akkhtimakt . Two , he want take opposite from Akkhtimakt . Three , he got no heart . Got no way understand you not all time mad like kif . You add all up , think like kif . He give you kif advisor  --  he number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you do . You got lot sfik with him . Also you got tame human . " " What 's that got to do with it ?

Same way stsho not understand kif : stsho want make deal with Akkhtimakt , want make same deal with Sikkukkut , same with Ehrran hani , a ? Someone eat they heart someday . Maybe Sikkukkut . Meanwhile , Sikkukkut want get me , a ? Want also get human . Human be big problem soon . Same tc'a . Stsho  --  they nothing without make alliance with hani , if they not more trust mahendo'sat . Anuurn hani damn fool get involve in this politic . " " They 're not the only ones . " " You born involve , Pyanfar . You spacer hani . You too smart . " " Then why am I here ? " " You got stake . We all got stake . " " Like what , like hani do all the fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your partner did to me at Gaohn ? Same as get me barred from Meetpoint  --  same as  --  " " Pyanfar . We all got stake . This Mkks be half mahen station , a ? I go take walk , I talk few people . Learn thing . " " Learned what ? " An expansive shrug . " Like knnn be upset . Like tc'a big disturb . Chi crazy like always . Like big rumor on methaneside got lot human come . Lot human . Stsho damn upset . " Mahen visionaries . Prophecies on the corn . " Gods-be . " It was there to have been read .

" Tc'a . Tc'a territory , right up to Meetpoint . " What fool set that up ? " " Kif know . I think they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into at Kefk ? For godssakes , Jik  --  "  | " Big game . Number one big game , hani . " " Game . Gods rot it , human ships have fired at knnn . " Jik 's jaw dropped . He closed it . " Tully told me . Now you trade me one , partner . Tell me the gods-be truth ! " " What you know ' bout knnn business ? " " Nothing else . Absolutely nothing , But a knnn ship was tracking me directly after Goldtooth gave me Tully ; stayed with me when I left Meetpoint headed for Urtur . I lost it . I do n't know where it went . But it was on me . It could have been at Urtur . It might even know I went to Kshshti . Hear ? We did have tc'a activity there . " " Damn , " Jik said . " Damn . " " Let me tell you something else . I do n't trust that tc'a stationmaster at Kshshti . I do n't know what it heard . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tc'a do ? " " Do ? It was scared witless , that 's what . Mention knnn near it and it went into gibbering lunacy . Avoid , it said . It talked about hani dying at Mkks . It talked  --  talked about three sets of kif to watch out for , one of them the kifish homeworld . " " I hear this . Not surprise . Homeworld kif wait see who win , a ? They not stupid . " " No , they 're not stupid , just a lunatic mahe who thinks I 'm going to play tag with the knnn and politics with the gods-be kif  --  " " You listen . " Jif looked her in the eyes and jabbed her in the chest with a blunt-clawed finger . " I tell you truth , tell you truth , hani and mahendo'sat be longtime friend , a ? Stsho friend only to stsho , same like kif . We got Sikkukkut , got same this fellow in the loo , a ? We got lot sfik , this kif Sikkukkut get some from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kif .

Sikkukkut enemy all be kif ; but I tell you , Pyanfar  --  lot people be Akkhtimakt enemy who not be kif Whole damn Compact . Humanity . Where he stop , huh ? And we already got knnn trouble . How much trouble we need ? " " They 're all crazy . " " You hani , you like too much law . Kif , they got Personage . Sen-sible , like mahendo'sat . Make life more simple . " He touched her shoulder again . " You see why I want you ' live ? You do n't cross Vigilance , a ? "  |p103A  clank sounded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This fancy ID system I 'm not supposed to ask if you got  --  any chance it can fool the beacon at Kefk ? " He rubbed the bridge of his nose and gave her an anxious glance . " I not say got . " " Can you ? " " Maybe I run  --  little ahead main group . Maybe we get beacon . One good look all I need . " " Maybe ! Kite in there alone ? " " A , got good kif friend , good friend Vigilance follow real close . " " Sure , sure . " " Hey , you no worry  --  you damn smart pilot , a ? " " Sure . No worry . No worry . Gods rot it , that 's a binary system , Jik , and that 's a kif you 've got to rely on ! " " Got you come . " " Gods , what do you think I am ? You 're crazy , you know that ? This whole thing is crazy ! You 're going to trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ana be right . You got nice eyes . " " You  --  " " Hey , I got go , " Jik said , holding up his hands . And with a lift of brows : " A. " He reached into one of his belt-pockets and pulled out a small square packet . " Want give you this . " " What ? " Her ears went down flat . " Gods-be , Jik , no more tricks ! No more  --  " " You take . " He pulled her hand forward and slapped the packet into her palm . " Things go bad you take , run , go Meetpoint , find help . " " What is this thing ? " " Record . Got same microfiche . You do n't worry . " A blithe mahen grin . " All code . " " Jik  --  " " I trust . " The Pride 's bow rang to a second thump ; the ventilation fans died and started up with a different , more rapid sound . They were on their own . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He started away down the corridor and looked back . " You be smart , Pyanfar . " " Go on , you 'll miss the ramp . " She pocketed the microfiches and picked up the pocket corn . " Haral . Stand by to let Jik out . His people still outside ? " " Still there . I 've been keeping an eye on them , captain . They 're all right . "  | " Huh . Good . " She broke the contact and walked back the other way , not without a misgiving glance at the washroom door . More thumps from the bow . The dockers were working fast . Anxious to get them out , one guessed . Pyanfar headed for the lift . A cold lump had settled in her stomach , indigestible . Gods , gods , and Jik himself never told all the truth . Not ever the part that told what he would do.  |p105It  was chaos in the bridgeward corridor as Pyanfar headed out of the lift . Tully was there with Hilfy , doing final latchcheck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing that . Tirun came running to catch the lift door with a covered bowl in either hand . " Hurry it , " Pyanfar yelled as Tirun darted past . " Aye , " Tirun said . " And do n't go in with it ! " The door shut . Upship , Chur was at her cabin door , with Geran ; she had a new and tightly wrapped bandage round her middle . There was a crash from lowerdecks , another seal in place . " You sure about this , " Pyanfar said in passing . " Absolutely , " said Chur . " Captain , " Geran said in courtesy , and Pyanfar left them both behind , headed bridgeward in long strides . Haral was at her post , the only one as yet , but Chur and Geran were trailing in at Pyanfar 's back . The boards were lit and The Pride 's initial systems were all up , with ready-lights on the rest . Pyanfar threw herself into her own chair and powered it about . " Captain . " Haral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , never a turn of her head or a missed beat in the routine switch-flicking of power-up . Pyanfar shoved the corn plug intop106her own left ear and leaned , fished the microfiche packet out of her pocket and shoved it in the security bin . " That it ? " Haral said . " That 's the latest bit of trouble . Gods , I 'm tired of mail-carrying . Gods give that Ehrran  --  " Khym showed up , from the galleyward corridor , his hands full of food-packets , his face all cheerful.  - -  sons , the ancient curse went . Pyanfar swallowed it and listened to the corn . The voice out of central was mahendo'sat , likewise the dockingchief talking to them on the outside line . One could believe the universe safe and sane ; and then a kif spoke up from down the row , giving them its outbound time . Khym reached past her to clip the concentrates at her elbow . Three packets , one of water . " Thanks , " Pyanfar muttered . And to Haral : " You mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's not on the plan . Something recent . Real recent . Did n't want to use that system in front of the kif , that 's what , and Sikkukkut was n't going to use his  --  eggs 'll get pearls Harukk 's got that equipment too and Sikkukkut wo n't use it . " " That where Jik was , you think ? Push-and-shove with the kif ? Tryingto get them to  --  " " Might 've been . Gods know . Gods know if Ehrran knows what he 's up to . " " He 's got to fill her in . If she comes in alone with the kif  --  " Clang-Chunk ! The accessway was loose . Crash ! The grapples fromMkks station retracted . They had their own grip on Mkks and theywere against the docking boom : that was all that held them now . " He did n't want to tell us , " Pyanfar said . " He was n't going to .

You do n't need to be part of it . " Haral 's ears went back . Offended . " Aye . If you want it that way . " " I do . Who heard ? " " Me . " " Huh . " Pyanfar looked to the controls and brought her board up . Ap107seat hissed under weight . She half-turned and saw Tully settle in next to Chur . " Tully . " " Captain ? " Tully turned his head , not using com and the translator . " You crew , huh ? " " I  --  " Tully misunderstood the question and fished up a small syringefrom the chairside pocket . " I sleep at jump , wake at Kefk . I work . " It sounded chancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them crazy . So they ran ships in and out of jump unconscious . Lunatics . " No fear , huh ? " A primate grin , quickly compressed to a hani smile . " I scared . " " Huh . Us too . " " Hurry it up ! " Haral said over shipwide corn . The voice echoed through the bridge and corridors . " Tirun , move it . " " Vigilance lodge a protest ? " Pyanfar asked , swinging round . " Aye , " Haral said , and wrinkled her nose and laid her ears back . " I 'd give this voyage 's profits to 've been in range of one of that pair in that lock . " " Huh . " Profits . She laughed . But humor died . " It was a stupid thing . Stupid , that 's what it was . Like a gods-rotted  --  " Khym was on the bridge and Pyanfar swallowed that ancient comparisondown too . Called up the outbound schedule . " Log that Ehrran business . Right down to the exit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I already had it separated . " " I 'll lay it out for the rest of us  --  Put Geran wise to it , huh ? " ( Gods , Khym back there , coming and going in all this business betweenher and Haral , between mahendo'sat in the lower corridor , and not a question out of him , not a What 's going on ? or a Why ? The world was out of shape . But she and Khym had both said a lot of things in the dark . Last watch . ) She glanced aside . Khym settled into observer one , between Hilfy 's as yet vacant post and Geran 's seat , flicking switches . He brought com live there , backup now to Hilfy . Geran would sit Chur 's post at scan one ; Tully observer two ; Chur moved to second scan ; and Tirun , with belowdeckscargo ops and second-bridge shut down , was left observer three , when she got to it , as auxiliary switcher , comp operator , engineer , and if things went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Pyanfar punched in lowerdeck monitoring . " Tirun . You all right down there ? " " I 'm coming , " said a breathless , moving source . The sound of runningfeet in main corridor below . Pyanfar broke the contact . Hilfy tookp108her post . Pyanfar caught the reflection in the monitor , against the light from Khym 's boards . Back in place . Home again . A ready light came on her board from Hilfy . A mahen voice sputtered in her ear : " Clear when ready . You got clear , Pride of Chanur " Hilfy acknowledged the station communication Khym had brought through , taking over . " Thank you , Mkks . " Routine and cool . Thank you , Mkks . Pyanfar 's blood went cold . Aft , the lift worked . That would be Tirun . " Geran , " Haral said , " put Vigilance on the guard-it list right along with the kif . " A moment 's silence . " You serious , huh ? " " Real serious . Jik says . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their scan operators were onto it . " Aja Jin to Pride , you got number one depart , go , go . " Running footsteps in the topside corridor behind . " Gods rot , " Haral said into the mike , " sister , we 're going , move , move , move ! " Footsteps reached the bridge , a body dropped into a chair and Haral hit the ungrapple program . Clank-bang . They were under power then , a little queasiness as The Pride came off station and gave herself that little bit of thrust that got her outbound . Nothing showy . The Pride could move . It was not a fact they cared to advertise to the kif or to any other watchers at Mkks . Haral brought The Pride about at leisure and took her time . They might have been hauling eggshells . " We got an update on the entry projections , " Pyanfar said . " Jik 's got a- " Then : " Priority , " said Hilfy , that dreadful word from a post with bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " from Mkks central 's ice-clear voice , " we got tc'a go outbound .

" Confirm something outbound from the methane-sector  --  " " That 's a kif away , " Haral said , overriding . " Scan two . Comp , get that tc'a figured . " " I 'm on it , " Tirun said . " Stand by , Geran . " Pyanfar gnawed her mustaches and snatched helm function to her board while Haral sorted priorities . Thank gods for full crew : com was babble from three prime sources and a dozen unauthorized outputs ; Geran was on station scan output and Chur tried to sort out blips exploding off Mkks station about them like seeds from a pod . Pyanfar kicked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rolled them up in a move that got to the pre-set course the hard way . Gods , they were on a hair-breadth schedule out to that jump-point , they had everything calculated down to the instant for that tandem jump , and the situation behind them looked like feathers in a windstorm . " Schedule 's blown to a mahen hell , " Haral said . " Gods blast that split-brained fool ! We got a lunatic mess back there ! " " Hilfy  --  " From Khym , urgently . " Priority , " Hilfy said . " Station transmission , general to all ships . " Image turned up on second monitor . Violet light : a writhing serpentshape , gold-mottled , that dipped and wove before the lens . Methane-sector was talking to them : methane traffic control on visual output .

" Hilfy : get comp on that . Tirun , go to corn one . " " Aye , " Hilfy said . Not a word of criticism . No outcry from the crew . The tc'a ship was out ahead of them , likely to foul their schedule ; a tc'a official onstation was talking about knnn , and no one sane wanted them involved . No one could talk to knnn but tc'a ; and tc'a talked like that , in matrices thatp110had to be read in all directions at once . It spoke of two tc'a presences , one at Mkks , going , perhaps  --  ( give a chi ? )  --  to tc'a at Kefk ; while knnn were involved all across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Kefk-bound ? ) and two kinds of hani ( gods , did it pick that schism up ? ) only one lot of kif was going to fight ?

Compose a message to the tc'a and tell it we go and itwaits . " " Aye . " From Hilfy , tautly . No ship talked to methane-breathers withoutfilling out abundant official queries afterward .

That engine-pack back there , this fancy new rig  --  nothing 's free , is it ? We 're in Chock , Hilfy Chanur . Nothing money pays for . And that Ehrran busi-ness- " Lines trued up . They were on , headed for their mark . The tc'a was out in front of them now , having gotten up to its speed : no more turns now , even for it . Nothing but a knnn played games with physics . " Gods-rotted tc'a 's going to be in front all the way , " Pyanfar said . " Gods only know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this .

" How much ahead ? " " He did n't say . No schema . Nothing . I tell you this , if he does n't make it , we got trouble . Real trouble . We got a nest of kif for one thing . We got some other things too . What are we going on corn ? We got some quiet out there ? " " Nothing worth listening to , " Haral said . " Lot of kif stuff . " " Vigilance has stopped transmitting , " Geran said . " So 's Aja Jin , " Hilfy said . " All right . Geran , I want you com backup right now ; take number one scan after jump . " " Got it . " " Hilfy . " " Aunt ? " " You asked about Ehrran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far in this business . Our troubles are n't just bad luck . They 've been coordinated . " " Ehrran ? " " Oh , higher than that , imp . We settled that dustup at Gaohn , we busted our hani enemies out of Kohan 's way , drove Tahar clan into near collapse , pushed Moon Rising into exile  --  We brought mahendo'sat to the homeworld , we brought humans and we brought knnn , which sets off the isolationists back home right proper , does n't it ? Naur . Her bunch . Llun clan got chewed up helping us at Gaohn ; so 'd others of our friends . Tahar , enemy that they were  --  we broke them and broke their power over their allies ; and that left vacuum , and that let some other clans move up in the hon. " " Naur and Jimun and Schunan , " Haral muttered . " Ehrran 's precious patrons . " " That 's precisely the shape of it . We were better off with Tahar for enemies . They were bastards , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldbound old eggsuckers like Naur ; and those fat old women 'd just as soon see us all back in kilts and sofhyn . " " It 's me , " Khym said . " Swallow it , Khym . " " Look , if I 'd stayed downworld  --  " " If not that , some other thing . We brought outworlders into Anuurn system  --  " "  --  and got a male offworld . " " So we got every bigot in the han stirred up . The spacing clans got chewed up bad at Gaohn ; among the Immunes , our Llun friends lostp113too gods-rotted many good women ; and Ehrran 's been itching after a piece of their rumps for years . Sure , Ehrran 'll kiss-foot for the Naur ; they got themselves that shiny ship , got themselves big ears and notebooks , and the stsho  --  those fluttering bastards have got their fingers in the stew . The macheno'sat leaned on the stsho to get our papers reinstatedbecause Goldtooth suddenly wanted our help  --  wanted spacing hani on his side . So the stsho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got Ehrran 's ear and sucked that fool right in . Ehrran was out at Meetpoint hunting down Tahar and doing any other bit of businessthe han wanted with the stsho  --  like secret negotiations , maybe , for a whole lot of things  --  and then the stsho up and offered them our hides for a bonus . " " Stle sties stlen , " said Hilfy . " Stsho got humanity coming in at their backs . They waffled on Goldtoothat Meetpoint . Gods know what they spilled to Ehrran ; and I think if Stle sties stlen were less corrupt and less scared of Goldtooth the old bastard would have sold Tully to the kif right off . But we were there , and Ehrran did n't bribe them , iron-spined fool that she is . Rotted stsho xenophobes are climbing all over each other , thinking about humanscoming in at their backs and straight up against stsho territory . But Ehrran played politics and got outbid  --  I 'm guessing . Stle sties stlen lost his nerve about doublecrossing Goldtooth when we turned up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be surprised if old Stle stles stlen worries a lot nowadays about the mahen guards at his door at night . And I 've got to tell you something else . Something you 'd better hear . Haral  --  you got that tape from down in the corridor ? " " Aye . " " Run it . That and the one with Sikkukkut.  --  We 've been getting a lot of offers , cousins . On all sides . " It was a long , long silence on the bridge , except for that thread of sound . Operations interrupted it . Pyanfar listened with one ear andwinced now and again , kept The Pride running , tried not to think what Hilfy was going to say . Or what the translator was doing with it in Tully 's ear . Tc'a . Tc'a . Methane-breathers were upset , Jik had said . Jik had been out in the station at large . In secret . Conniving with gods knew what agencies ; and tc'a were high on the list of possibilities . Right along with Sikkukkut . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got us into a mess , " Pyanfar said . " One gods-be mess . I thought you 'd like to know just what kind . " " Sounds like  --  " Tirun said , " sounds like Jik 's right . We were born involved . Being Chanur . When we get home  --  I 'm betting we wo n't find the han what we left . " " I 'm betting we wo n't , " Pyanfar said . " But what is , nowadays ? " Another long silence . " Well , I 'm with you , " Tirun said . " Same , " Chur said ; and : " Same , " her sister said . " Aunt , I  --  " " Maybe you want to think about it , niece . " The beep and tick of instruments went on . Tc'a matrix came up as comp sorted it , but it was all the same . " Tully , " Pyanfar said , " you understand even half of it ? " " I hear some . " Pyanfar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection in a monitor , one un-hani silhouette . " I hani , " he said . " I hani . " She blinked , thinking that through . But it made a warm spot all the same . " Khym , " she said . " My opinion ? " he said . A great sigh gusted into corn , a low rumbling . " Pity Ehrran 's Immune . " " But they are , " Hilfy said . " They 'll go at father . They 'll go for him at home . We may not have Chanur any more . " " I figure , " said Pyanfar , " I figure Kohan Chanur 's still no easy mark , niece . My brother and your father 's no fool . Neither 's any of our sisters , to let the bastards maneuver them out of the house . They 'll be holding on . Long as we 're in space , long as there 's Chanur ships loose to worry about  --  Naur and her pets 'll use some caution about dirty tricks . Kohan can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight 's fair . " And she thought of Khym when she said it , and felt an old pang of guilt : If I 'd been home when Kara challenged him , if I 'd been there to prevent hangers-on from interferingKhym might still be lord in Mahn if she had been home  --  if she had come blasting in for him the way Chanur clan had rallied for Kohan Chanur against her son Kara Mahn . Khym might not be in exile now if she had been there  --  even alone . Even when the rest of his wives and sisters and daughters deserted him . She might have stood by him against their son and their blackguard daughter . Chanur might then have had its best ally intact , in Khym lord Mahn . And the likes of Ehrran would not have risen and the world would not have changed.  | " Nav fix positive , " said Haral . " Wonder if that tc'a up there understands the flight plan , " Tirun said .

Doubtless the rest of them were flutternervedas well . " I 'm with you , " Hilfy said hoarsely . " Thanks , niece .  --  Stand by , everybody . We 're coming up on jump . Tully . You better use the drugs . Help him , Chur . Make sure he 's out . " " Aye , " Chur said . She punched in all-ship . " Kif  --  Skkukuk . Get ready : we 're going for jump .

As well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they talked good hani back to it ; and nothing intelligible got said to either mind . I offer you your enemies . There was stress in its voice .

It was , gods knew , as trapped in its fortunes as they were  --  their good luck talisman ; or their personal jinx . " Jump plus ninety , " Haral said . " Fixed on Kefk . " " Get it in your heads , " Pyanfar said , because the other side of jump , things fuzzed and habits took over . " Jik might not make it . If he does n't , we 've got to move fast : get position first . Locate Harukk next . Remember that , hear ? We 're going in with G. We 'll make it that easy on ourselves . If it goes real sour we 've got a few options . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tt'av'a'o ; we run for Meetpoint if we have to . That 's not Jik 's plan ; it 's mine .

" I 'm on-duty . " " Khym ? " He was the sick one . She had thought so . No answer but a moan . " We 're nominal on equipment , " Tirun said . " We still got the kif back there , " Geran said . " Got another ship just blipped in behind us . Ikkiktk . . . I think . . . right on mark , five minutes Light . " Everywhere about them the tick and blip of instruments went on , The Pride 's ordinary functions , unflappable mechanical processes . " Tully ? " Chur said . " Tully , you all right ? " " What that ? " A slurred , faint voice on coin . " What ? " " Tc'a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Closest I ever want to hear about . " " That 's blip two : second kif in. "  | " We just got a message from the lead kif back there , " Hilfy said . " It 's confirming it 's behind us , that 's all . " " Acknowledge , " Pyanfar said . Their realscan showed their own little packet of space ; their passive-signal pickup , half a roundtrip quicker than bounce-signal scan , showed them the stars and the things that reflected light , and the lead ships ' recent emission-trails . A lot of them . " We 've got time-calc on that image , " Tirun said . " Jik 's doing fine . Jik , Ehrran , Sikkukkut and a flock of the hakktkt 's best . Haaa we gotHarukk scan now  --  Clear , clear , clear ! " " Good luck to ' em , " Haral muttered . " Even the gods-be kif . " " Hope those earless bastards at Kefk have n't moved any rocks , " Geran said . " We 're running into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't aware yet of anything , on this timeline . Geran , I 'm going to feed you sequencing on this stuff . See if you can do a locator on it , get an update on these positions . " " Lot of scatter , " Geran said . " Chun , take scan one . " Down the time line again , racing their own incoming wavefront toKefk station . Waiting for the message to come back . But this time they had shed a lot of speed . Kif talked behind them in another time-reference , station-kif talked , and that clicking chatter occupied corn . More kif dropped in behind them . And the tc'a glided along beside . " We 're getting reaction now , " Hilfy said . " That 's a guardstation talking , I think . They 're challenging . That 's minus twelve Light . " Two guard stations , one at Kefk 1 nadir , to stop escapees ; one atKefk 1 zenith , not so far away . The third off in Kefk 2 's ecliptic . And Kefk station itself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . " Harukk just answered , " Hilfy said . " Harukk ordered Kefk system to surrender . Challenge goes on . . . . I ca n't make out if they'velaunched anything . Translator , Khym ; help ; gods-be  --  " " Is that it ? " "  --  Back it up . Geran . " " Sorry , " Khym said . " I 'm sorry  --  " " I got it , " Geran said . " That 's affirmative on launch . Two interceptorsaway from Kefk 1 on Jik 's contact-moment . " " Intercept vector for Jik , " Hilfy said . " Kif behind us report  --  " Khym said , " they just heard that defense-engage. "  |p121Pyanfar  bit her mustaches , watched the steady rotation of images Haral shunted past her screens . " Unchanged , " Hilfy said . " Tc'a 's unchanged , " Chur said . " Still by us . " " Let 's hope it stays put , " Haral said . " Unchanged , " Hilfy droned on . Then : " Wait , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're real disturbed and they 're speaking pidgin as well as mainkifish . We wo n't get the guardstation transmission to station or to Jik 's bunch at their angle . " " What 's it doing ? " Khym 's first out-of-line question , in a careful , quiet voice . " What the godssakes is it up to ? " " Easy . " Haral 's voice . " We 're not skinned yet . " " Kif , " Tully said sharply . " Tully 's right , " Chur said from scan . " Another one of our party just came in . " " Huh , " Geran said , " By the gods all and sundry , we may just make it . " That 's a hakkikt , five kif hunter ships , Aja Jin and a han deputy telling them there 's a tc'a inbound at their tail , " Tirun muttered . " And they do n't know what more or how many . You think that wo n't shake them up ? If I was kif with my nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real upset just now . They 'll fold . Sikkukkut 's not half crazy . " " Huh , " Pyanfar muttered . Crew talked themselves to confidence . Her stomach fought her again and she fought it back . Comp asked a question , offered choices . She kept her eyes focussed , read comp 's suggestion , scanned two other monitors and punched confirm . Another desperate swallow . Her hand shook , terror catching up to her in a chill when the moment was long past . The tc'a could have hit them . Gods . How much closer ? How much closer before they got pulled apart ? Or before they made one ball of fire , hani , tc'a and kif together ? " They friend ? " Tully asked and no one had time . " Tc'a insystem are upset , " Hilfy said . " We 're starting to get chatter out of our own tc'a . It identifies itself and us . They 're sixteen minutes down the timeline . " Camera image came up on the screens : Haral had gotten them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange sun washing out the stars . There was a red dwarf companion , Kefk 2 , invisible or inconspicuous . Everything else was still too far . Heavy debris orbited Kefk , by Sikkukkut 's outdatedcharts . And four stations all told , with a lot of disturbed kif.  | " Transmission , " Hilfy said . " It 's them ! "  --  forgetting protocols . " It 's Jik ! " "  --  Hold course , " the message reached Pyanfar via Haral 's switching . " You hold course . We go ahead in . Got no trouble yet  --  " " They know the guard ships are on their track ? " Khym wondered . " Ca n't tell , " Haral said . " They ought to . That 's  --  ten minutes Light . We 're still getting output . . . just chatter . Jik 's bunch is n't upset , and they 're further into the timeline than we are . " " Looking good , " Geran said . Pyanfar let out a breath . A chill went up her back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the gods , to come in blind like that and pick up signal on the mark , with all the kif behind them . Navigation like that was a hunter-ship trick . Not for honest merchant-folk . But they did it . They had done it . They were alive so far . " Haral , " Hilfy exclaimed , " we just got beacon ! " Image flashed up on monitor . Full current system composite : it showed Sikkukkut 's cluster of ships inbound for the main station ; showed a skein of ships inbound where they themselves ought to be . the kif , the tc'a , The Pride . And the interceptors . Three guard stations ; a belt full of miners ; an outbound ship ; a schema of the main station that show forty-six ships in dock , origin indeterminate . Same as Jik 's initial snatch of image before beacon shut down . Give or take their own presence . And the interceptors . " We believe that thing ? " Tirun asked . " Kefk 's talking , " Hilfy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  welcomingus in . " " Gods , " Haral said . " Now it 's really working I do n't like it . " Pyanfar gnawed her mustaches . " I do n't either . Message . Relay Jik what it sent and put our wrap around it . " " Aye , " " Kif are talking , " Khym said . Haral switched it . " Behind us. " "  --  kkthos fikkthi kthtokkuri ktokkt Harukkur shokkuin . " " They 're querying Harukk , " Pyanfar translated . " Sounds like they'reconfused as we are . " " That 's good news , " Haral muttered . " Our tc'a 's transmitting too , " said Hilfy . " Same stuff as before . I 'm coming in with hani and kif. ' "  | " That 's the reason for our welcome , " Geran said . " That lunatic tc'a . They ca n't shoot . " " Yet , " said Pyanfar , and chewed her mustache-ends . She reached for another packet and drank it in one forced series of gulps . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurtled at C-residual V toward a kifish stronghold that wanted to let them in . Past a doubtless armed guard-station . Get them onto the docks , she could imagine the counsels in that chunk of fragile metal up ahead . We outnumber them . Lure them out of their ships if possible . Send poison through their ventilation tubes if not . Let the tc'a dock peacefully in the methane-sector and then destroy the intruders on the oxy side . " We brought our own private kif along , did n't we ? " Pyanfar said . " Tirun . Khym . We 've got a little time inertial . I want you two to go down , get some flex , and bring our guest in the washroom up here . His name 's Skkukuk . Be polite . Tell him I sent for him . " " Aye , " Tirun said . A moment later . " Aye , " said Khym . Kif on The Pride 's bridge . The other side of Mkks , she would have sooner died.  |p124The  lift worked , down-bound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one kif coming up topside , near sensitive controls . Unease crawled up and down Pyanfar 's spine . She flicked switches at her board , taking some of The Pride 's automatic reflexes under her own hand while Tirun and Khym , where that lift let out , entered corridors that could become a four story plunge straight down if The Pride 's thrust cut in for some unexpected reason  --  like an avoid-alert . They were perhaps cavalier about such scramblings-about while The Pride was inbound at some commercial port , with safe lanes and the prospect of a long , sedate voyage under inertia . Kefk lacked all such guarantees . " You stay course . " Jik 's voice sputtered into the complug in Pyanfar 's left ear : Haral had relayed it , on slight delay . Pyanfar flicked her ears back , looked at the time-differential of several situations ticking away on the upper margin of the number four monitor . Not enough time for her query to have gotten Jik 's direct response : half that . He had anticipatedthe question , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some source , maybe one from Kefk station itself . " Sikkukkut 's transmitting , " Hilfy said . " Same sort of thing . " If anything short-flashed between Harukk and Aja Jin or vigilance , close as they were riding within their own little band of kif , Jik gave nop125clue to this . " We got system scan now , got Kefk output ; they not want trouble , a ? Nice friendly port . " Gods . " We stay it , " Pyanfar said to the crew about her . She twitched in misery ; fatigue settled like a hot iron between her shoulderblades and into that shoulder and elbow locked into the brace above the control board . She sweated and stank and shed hair ; crew were no better . The hunter-ships would likely have had a shift to backup crew now and again , all crew seated in a touchy situation like this , but taking the shunt to give main-crew a chance to stretch and eat and take the kinks out of their backs . The hunter-ships would have that luxury ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead ; and gods only knew if the multibrained tc'a even needed relief . She left shed fur on what she touched . And the aches  --  gods . " Jik says they 've asked for a ship list over and over again . No responsefrom station . " " That 's not good , " Haral said . " Not at all friendly of them , " Chur said . " Hope that tc'a stays real close , " said Pyanfar . " The tc'a 's still transmitting , " Hilfy said . " Same stuff . " " How are you doing , Chur ? " Pyanfar asked . " Uhhhn . Lost a bit of weight . Gods-be concentrates . . . we got to get a hot-box on the bridge if we keep this up . Nice warm food . " " Food ? " Tully asked . " He has a hard time biting through the packets , " Geran said . " Here ... now . You got to have the teeth for it , friend . . . He 's catching on with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . " " Math , " Tully said . " Help if he could read , " Pyanfar said . " Sure might . " No knowing whether human instrumentation was anything like their own . And his blunt-nailed hands had no hope of hani recessed buttons . Thank the gods . There was nothing he could push . But a kif 's retractable claws were quite another matter . She should , she thought , have gone down to the lower deck herself and left the ship in Haral 's capable hands . Not called a kif to the bridge . It was too late to do otherwise . She saw the flash from the optionaltelltalethat was presently linked to lift operation and withdrew her arm from the brace . " Haral . You 've got it . " " Aye . " " We got a kif coming up . All of you  --  " Pyanfar rotated her chairp126crew-ward . " All of you keep your minds on your work , huh ? Is this going to be a problem for anyone ? " Silence . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From multiple throats . Tully turned a bewildered look her way . Hilfy never budged . " Geran , take over corn for now . Hilfy wants a relief . " " Aye , captain . " Hilfy swung her chair half about . Her ears were back . " I did n't say  --  " .1 " I know you did n't . I want you on guard . Something wrong with that ? " " No , aunt , " Hilfy said , a quiet voice . She spun back to the board andlooked up as Geran released restraints and prepared to shift . Pyanfar spun her chair the other way and undid her own restraints . " Is this a test ? " Hilfy asked . " No , " Pyanfar said . " It is n't . It 's the real thing . I figure you know the kif well enough . Do n't you ? Maybe your considered opinion 's worth something . " Hilfy 's ears slanted back . Her adolescent mustaches drew down in a look of distress . " Putting it on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't by-the-gods patronize me . " " Do n't by-the-gods foul up . " Hilfy 's mouth opened ; she shut it definitively . The ears struggled erect . There was a nick in one . A gold ring swung from the sweep of the other . " All right ? " Ears twitched . " All right . " Hilfy 's voice shed its edge . The eyes stayed black . Down the corridor the lift-door had opened . " We 've got company . " Silence then . Pyanfar stood up , facing that oncoming set , in the centerof which was a tall , robed darkness that set her teeth on edge . So a kif arrived on the bridge , in the doorway , Tirun and Khym oneither side . Hilfy stood up and Geran switched seats . " Tirun . Take scan one . " Tirun took the indicated post without question . Khym stayed still at Skkukuk 's side , tall as the kif , twice its size in other ways . Tirun could have cracked its bones barehanded . Khym could take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs did not flex back conveniently . " Captain , " Skkukuk said.  |p127Tully  had turned in his seat , just once and briefly . Something had touched his face  --  wariness , surely . Maybe something else . But he was eyes-to-the-scope again , his back turned to the kif . Pyanfar noted it , and her estimation of the human went up another notch with that . " You all right , Skkukuk ? " Politely posed . Skkukuk lifted his bound hands and let them fall . His dark , redrimmedeyes wept tears of eyestrain in the light . " This is stupidity , " Skkukuk said . " Behind the neck , hani , is far more effective . We can bite through wire . " " Thanks . We 'll remember that next time . Do you know where we are ? " " Kefk , I suppose . " " Why do you suppose that ? " Yet another shrug . " It was the hakkikt 's intent . " " Sikkukkut 's . " " That hakkikt . Yes . " " He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well known among his ships . " " Were you  --  among his ships ? " Skkukuk ducked his head . " You were Akkhtimakt 's , huh ? " " I am yours now . " The dark head lifted , the jaws worked . " I lend you my sfik . I am formidable , even now . " " You lend me confidence . Tell me , Skkukuk . Do you know Kefk ? " " Yes . Thoroughly . " " Why do you suppose Kefk has n't launched a defense ? " " You want my assistance . " " I 'm asking you , kif . " Skkukuk gave a kifish shrug and lifted his hands toward the scan posts , miming request . " Show me the situation . " " Haral , put the scan image up on main . " It arrived . The kif 's face lifted to the overhead , where the big screen was . " What we 've got here , " Pyanfar said , " is Vigilance and Aja Jin and Harukk out in front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship 've gone inertial now . No great hurry on them . Beyond that interval , ourselves . A tc'a beside us . The rest of the kif with a ship named Ikkiktk in charge of the rest . " " A tc'a . " " That ship 's named So'oa'ai . " Another small gesture of joined hands . " This is ominous . "  | " Why ? " Skkukuk 's eyes went to her and Hilfy . The stink of unwashed hani and human was already on the bridge . Now there was a strong ammoniascent . " The methane folk are unpredictable . " " Have you got reason to say that ? They 've been stirred up . Have n't they ? " " Yes . " The ammonia reek was very strong . Kif sweat . " I advise caution . Do n't offend this thing . Do n't speak to it . Let it dock . " " That 's what the station seems to be doing . " " That 's the wisest thing . " " We conduct our little disagreement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kkkt . That 's adequate . Yes . We do . There are always the methane folk . " " What were you  --  before you offended Sikkukkut ? " " Skku to him . Subordinate . " Her ears went back . She pricked them up again . " Friend of Akkhtimakt 's , huh ? " " Skku to him also . " " You have one chance , kif , to tell all the truth in terms I understand . You play games with me and I 'll serve you back to Sikkukkut for dinner . After I give you to the human and my niece for their amusement . Hear ? " The kif 's head drew subtly lower between his shoulders . The hands lifted and fell . " I hear , hani . " " Then tell the gods-be truth ! " " I 've offered you my weapons . I will give you your enemies . Name them to me . Or let me hunt them out . I will lend you sfak . Hani can be fools . " " So can kif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those ahead of us are going in . Sikkukkut says come in . Is it a trap , kif ? " " Of course it 's a trap ! " " Whose ? " " Sikkukkut 's . And theirs . No one is to be trusted . Keep your speed , blast all and run . " Thin hands spread as best they could . " Perhaps the station and its defenses would take out the rest . But strike Aja Jin and cripple him ; Nomesteturjai would pursue you to the death . Harukk would be the lesser danger in those circumstances . Kif would desert the hakkikt in such an attack . But strike him if you have time , the same with Vigilance . Still  --  " The hands fell , the shoulders hunched . " Your ship lacks weapons ; and hani would not respect your sfik . Do thesep129things and go to the hakkikt Akkhtimakt . Bring him your weapons and he will welcome you . " " Gods be , " Pyanfar said . Her fur bristled down her back . Her ears had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ldf 's shoulder , Khym stood with ears still flat . And Hilfy " He would , " Hilfy said . " Our kifish ally would do that . What 's he waiting for ? " " Shall I answer this person ? " " Answer her , " Pyanfar said , " and respect my crew , rot your guts . You belong to all of us . " Again a hunch of the shoulders , a sinking of the hooded head . " I answer . Sikkukkut thinks he had sfik enough to lure Akkhtimakt to a place of his choosing . He thinks he has sfik enough that Kefk will offer him its weapons  --  " "  --  meaning what ? " "  --  that . They will be part of his sfik . He will hold Kefk temporarily , beyond doubt . Possibly he will take it completely . " " Make sense , " said Khym . " It 's truth . " Skkukuk turned that way and theirs again , opening his narrow hands before him . " Am I to blame that Sikkukkut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nourish hope this is a strategem . " " You hate Sikkukkut , huh ? " " I would spit him from my mouth . " Her stomach turned . " How are we doing , Haral ? " " Steady on . Transmission from our lead still says come ahead . Other situations unchanged . " Maybe there was time to put this atrocity safely back in its confinement . Maybe not . " Get him to a seat , " Pyanfar said to Khym and Hilfy : " Move . We do n't know what we 're into . Belt it in real tight . " " There is no need . I tell you I could free myself , " " See he does n't . " " Do n't be a fool , " Skkukuk said , straightening as Khym took him by one arm and Hilfy moved to take the other . " One moment , " Pyanfar said . Motion stopped . " Question , " Pyanfar said . " Is there a hani ship named Moon Rising with Akkhtimakt ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . They are  --  kthok kakatk kthi nankkhi sfikun  --  of diminishing sfik . They brought some of the sfik of Akkukkak to Akk1 ? timakt , but it was n't much by then.  |p130They  've been of use . Ktoht-sfik . A good knife has that . But without ornateness . One values it . One can take another . " Gods , the logic . " Go sit down . Trust me , kif . " " The captain jokes . Further , I am hungry . I protest this treatment . " Pyanfar hissed and sank into her chair . " I wish to tell the captain  --  " " Sit it down . And hurry it up . " Her back was still bristled ; she looked back again , to see Hilfy and Khym drop the kif into observer four and jerk the restraints tight over his arms . Tully looked her way . There was stark fear in his eyes . Observer four was a non-working post one seat removed from him  --  much too close , by Tully 's evident reckoning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me too  --  " And louder : " You 've got a job , Tully . Do it , huh ? Work " A " Aye , " Tully said , and swung about and glued himself to the scope . Chur muttered something to him . He muttered something back . Pyanfar spun her chair about . " Kif says it 's a trap , " Haral said . " Figured that , " Pyanfar said . " From the start , did n't we ? " " Sounded like good kifish advice . " " I 'm sure it is . " A moment 's silence . " Wonder what Jik 's got in mind , " Haral said . And after a moment more : " Captain  --  That business about Vigilance I 've got no trouble believing . I know Jik 's saved our necks before . " " But ? " " But coming in here like this  --  Captain , you ever remotely wonder if Jik 's been working the dark spots  --  a bit too long ? " " It occurs to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Occurs to mereal strong lately . It 's going to be a lot stronger feeling on that dock . " There was quiet on the bridge , except for the occasional beep from asystem needing the crew 's attention . " Revert to posts ? " Tirun queried . " When you 're covered , " Haral said . Seats whispered and hummed , Hilfy and Khym settling in . Readylightscame live in the sorting-out of crew . " Kkkk-kkt . " From the kif . " Shut it down . " ( Tirun 's voice . ) " Jik 's response , " Hilfy said . " He says to our query , just stay it . Vigilancesays , quote : Follow orders . " " No reply , " Pyanfar said . So what 's Vigilance up to , huh ? Ehrran was still going along with it  --  at this range.  |p131And  Jik with that ship at his sideStrike first , the kif advised , knowing his own kind . Kif would . A dire , ugly thought offered itself in the wake of that musing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ships came in ; among all those kif , with projectiles loosed , accidents might happen , ships losingtrack of where fire had been laid down -- if things went wrong , if they were betrayed and shooting started  --  A very easy accident . Like one hani ship running into the other 's fire .  --  blast Viglance 's vanes and leave them for the kif . Take out thewitnesses and all those recordsIt was not Chanur 's style . It was , gods help them , Sikkukkut 's own simple way.  --  want make sure you not come ' cross bow with Vigilance at Kefk  --  Take out the witnesses . With The Pride lost  --  there were piles of evidence and charges in Vigilance 's databanks . And Vigilance could go back to the han and offer it all uncontested , how Chanur betrayed hani and the han . Take The Pride out and accuse Chanur , and let Kohan Chanur fall ; then the carrion-lovers moved in and homeworld took the course Ehrran and her ilk longed for . But accidents could go either direction  --  if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . Vigilance had no kif to advise them : could an Anuurn hani ever think of such a vile thing unhelped ?  --  Out in the dark spots too long , Haral said of Jik . Maybe , she thought , it described an aging hani captain all too well . " We 're getting dock assignment , " Haral said at last , as if they were approaching any port in all the Compact . " Number 12 . That 's Jik beyondEhrran , Harukk way down the row . " " Methane-side 's transmitting , " Tirun said , " docking for the tc'a . " " Looks like a Compact standard setup , " Haral said while Pyanfar kept her attention on business . " Give or take the guns and the guard stations . No ship-names , rot their eyes . But we got a knnn in there , along with six tc'a . " " I do n't like that , " Pyanfar said . " Gods , I do n't like that . " A handful of tc'a in port and two more insystem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mostly mining and some cultivation , in their side of the station , of the cultures which methane-breathers relished , part furniture , part food . No threat there . But anomalous behavior around a knnn  --  drew attention . Undoubt/edly they had its notice . It was sitting still . Minding its own business . Watching , maybe , the curious madness of oxybreathers . " Acknowledge the instruction , " Pyanfar said . " Kkkkt . " From the kifThey were far past the mark when they should have started realspace braking in any friendly system . Lagtime between themselves and Jik stayed constant . Between them and station collectively it had decreased . Suddenly Jik 's number started ticking down . " Jik 's group is braking , " Chur said in the same moment . " We get a confirm on coin , " Tirun said . " Looks like here we go . " " Transmission from Harukk , " Tirun said . " They want  --  get that !  --  Orders to the kif to brake . " " Priority : Aja Jin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tc'a ' , " Haral muttered , switch-flicking . " Match moves with a polybrained gods-be snake  --  Good gods . What 's he think we are ? " " A prime target , " Pyanfar said . " That 's what . He 's next to Sikkukkut . He wants us in the old snake 's shadow , right up to station . Like we were real cozy . I 'm willing if it is . " She reached and snapped the restraintsin place , chest-belt and arm-brace . " Snug in . Gods , Chur  --  you fit for this ? Straight answer . " " I 'm fit . Soon be in this chair as walking that corridor back to quarters , I 'll tell you . " " You play hero I 'll send you for a walk . " The tc'a-blip stayed steady on , ghosting along inertial as if it knew it served as shield . She reached for another concentrates packet , solids , this time . It tasted horrid . Her stomach rebelled and she shuddered . Beside her , Haral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brain functioning . By this time the hunter-ships were surely on their second shift of wellrestedcrews . " The tc'a 's being real reasonable so far , " Haral said . " Does it understand ? " Khym asked from corn . " Are those things ever friendly ? " " Those things do what they want and gods forbid it zigs or zags . It will when it gets to approach V. " " Knnn , now , " Haral said , " have fewer rules . " Vid came up on last-monitor , a collection of spheres and drivepack with five vanes irregularly spaced about it . " That tc'a ? " Tully asked  | " Closest you 'll ever want to see one in motion , " Haral said . " Yes , it 's tc'a . " " Kkkt " From Skkukuk , " Kkkkt . Kkkkt , " a soft droning , talking to himself . Gods-rotted kit ' . Skkukuk 's advice was what Skkukuk would do . If he had the guts . The sfik , The self-assurance .

" Mysteries and mysteries . Doubtless hani puzzled Skkukuk too . " Kkkkt , " it said . " Kkkkt . " " Kif , shut up . " There was silence then . " Tc'a , " Khym said in distress . " Hilfy , tc'a  --  " Communications matrix came up on-screen . " Priority . It 's going to  --  " The Pride yawed , and power slammed in . " Gods and thunders ! " Pyanfarswore. "  --  maneuver , " Hilfy said . Stable again . Gods-be earless gods-be lunatic  --  A stream of profanity , holding the concentrates that wanted to crawl back up her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deep gasp . The Pride kept up the braking thrust .

" Kif back there are n't happy , " Geran said . " Neither am I , " Pyanfar muttered . " Gods rot  --  " The tc'a left them , rolled and slewed off in an approach maneuver that made sense to a multibrained snake.  |p134She  held course . " No following that . We 're on our own .

" Guard ship 's braking , " Haral said . " Message from Harukk : Sikkukkut 's compliments and he invites our docking . Says Kefk has surrendered . " " Tc'a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Hilfy 's voice , weak and strained . " That 's station , docking instructions for the tc'a . " " Kkkkt . " " Skkukuk . " Pyanfar shifted her eyes to look up at a reflection of the bridge . " What 's your opinion , huh ? " " The station has surrendered . " " Where 's the trap now ? " " Kkkt . They will let you dock . Beware Sikkukkut . Beware your allies . Return my weapons , hani . Arm me with the best you have . I will be an advantage . " " To which side ? " " Kkkt . To the side of advantage . Sikkukkut has none for me . Kkkotokkto ufikki Sikkukkutik nifikekk nok Akkhtimaktok kektkhikt nok nokktokme -- kkkkt . " Something about Akkhtimakt and meals and unique objects .

" Sounds like he 's got a problem , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which I do n't , not half . " " That 's confirmed from Jik , " Hilfy said . " Jik 's committing himself to dock . Harukk 's transmitting . " " Gods rot it . " Pyanfar flexed her hand in the brace and laid her ears back . The pulse kept on hammering in her ears . " We 're fools . Gods-be kif station , gods-be lunatic mahe  --  " Where 's our shiplist , Jik ? " What 's he up to ? " Haral asked . So Haral had thought much the same , in the secrecy of her old and wily heart , that at the last moment Jik might pull something . " I do n't know . Hilfy ; feed the schema down to Skkukuk 's screen . " " Aye . " " Does that look normal , kif ? " " The traffic is heavy here , but it often is . They give you no ship names . "  | " No . " " That is alarming . " " Vigilance going in , " Khym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I wonder about . " " Sure thought that son would bolt , " Tirun said . " Skkukuk . What will they do ? " " They will surrender . Slowly . Testing sfik against sfik . Withholding the shiplist may be the station 's test of the hakkikt . " " Or Sikkukkut 's order ? " " He has no motive to withhold it . The ships about us obey him . No , it 's a test of him . It will be an expensive test if they are not careful . Kukottki-skki pukkuk . Sikkukkut may interest himself to find the one who withstood him . Do you wish to gain sfik at Sikkukkut 's expense ? Discover this fool on the station and kill him before Sikkukkut does . Captain , I tell you , it is a waste  --  " " Priority ! " Chur yelled , simultaneously with Tully . " System entry , ecliptic 23-45 , V z-70-aught factor 9  --  " Pyanfar 's heart stopped . A lurking ship was on a nine-G startup and headed in ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relayed as it came " Relay on ! " she ordered , and Hilfy already had the system set : the message went , calmly : " This is The Pride . We 've got an incoming , Aja Jin . Take  --  " And over-riding her own message : " Priority , " Hilfy said . " Aunt , it 's Mahijiru ! That 's Goldtooth coming in ! The kif  --  Harukk 's sending . Do n't fire , he 's telling his ships , do n't fire , it 's allied . " Keep your speed , blast all and run , the kif advised . No one is to be trusted . They were hani . Not kif . " Send , " Pyanfar said past the nausea in her throat . " Pride to MahUiru . Gods fry you , Goldtooth , it 's about time you showed up ! "  |p136Harukk  went into dock ; Aja Jin ; Vigilance and the advance kif guard followed in final approach : " The hakkikt take dock now , " word came from Aja Jin then ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oxy-side traffic control will shut down briefly , " first in mainkifishand then in hani . " Pride of Chanur , this is Kefk central : oxy-side traffic control will shut down transmission briefly and resume with Harukk personnel , compliments of the hakkikt Sikkukkut an'nikktukktin ; methane-side operations will continue . Please stand by . " " Skkukuk ? " Pyanfar asked . " The hakkikt Sikkukkut has secured the dock around his ship , " the kif said from his seat across the bridge . " His force is on its way to take station central ; central indicates no resistance . Hani , I am suffering . Kkkt . I am  --  " " So are all of us . Shut up , " " Beware traps .

You lost it , kid , everyone knows it , the kif knows it . Pick it up again , huh , niece ? Let 's pick it up , mind on business , you 're doing all right , kid . And a little later : " Aunt , " Hilfy said ; and from corn : "  --  This is Kefk traffic control , compliments of the hakkikt resuming transmission .

" Politeness . Listen to ' em . " " Skkukuk ? " Pyanfar asked . " You hear that ? " " It seems straightforward . " Skkukuk said from his post at the rear of the bridge .

Not hurrying as much as he might . But decidedly on his way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we dock and take no connections but shielded line and personnel access . " " Affirm and acknowledge . " " Kkkt . Most of all beware your allies . Beware  --  " " Shut it down , kif . " " Fools , I have been given to fools . " They kept coming . Ahead of them their lone tc'a escort underwent its lunatic evolutions on its way to docking on Kefk 's methane side . Kefk 's methane-side control sent out data matrices in tc'a communication . And camera image came up now on monitor 4 , Haral 's sending.  |p138Kefk  station shone in its own floods like a baleful star , lit in orange and red . " Gods-be mahen hell , " Chur said . " Kif have a hell ? " Tirun wondered . " How about it , Skkukuk ? " No answer . " They do n't swear , either , " Hilfy said . " Kif do n't swear , do they , kif ? " " Mind on your business , " Pyanfar said shortly . " Kefk , " Haral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khym 's board . Kefk stats started up , and Tirun sorted them on comp , searching for anomalies and trouble . " All clear , all clear , " Tirun said , " we got a normal approach at this V. all standard for Kefk 's size . " More numbers started rolling in . " Auto this ? " Haral wondered . " Affirm , " Pyanfar said . There was no reason not to . The Pride took the numbers in as Haral punched into the auto-approach : tired , gods , they were all tired . A red light blinked urgently , comp 's advisement that armament was live and it was being asked to violate the law . Pyanfar overrode with a triple keypunch and logged that decision with another press of a key . " Approach under hostile conditions , " she muttered into the recorder . " Armaments will stay live until dock . " The vid screen caught her eye . There was a tone-difference in the slowly rotating station , a few ships not taking the floods in the same way as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots in Kefk 's asyet indistinguishable row of oxybreatherships , beside the methane-sector rim . She keyed in a tighter shot . Tighter still . " I 'm not picking up any heat , " Haral said , " except on the ships I think are ours . " Meaning no hostile ship 's engines were hot and no one unanticipated was lately come or about to bolt dock . Yet . " We got more than kif at this station , " Pyanfar said . " Haral , have a look at vid one . We 've got more bright spots on that rim than we ought to have . " " I see it . Maybe the spare 's our fugitive stsho . Maybe it docked here . Maybe it had to . " " Might be . " " Or more of Jik 's gods-be conniving ? " " Or Goldtooth 's . " The Pride trimmed up and lines trued on : Kefk station kept talking , realtime now for all practical consideration . The system schematic indicated a scatter of miner craft , all insystem and hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardships , which had shed their V and began a sedate return to their base . And MahOiru advancing with the only speed in the system besides their own that still warranted a flashing red line on the course-plot . " Aja Jin says they 've got the dock secure , " Hilfy said . " Mahijiru 's requesting docking instructions . " " Huh , " Haral said , and : " thank the gods , " from Geran . Not going to attack then . Once the braking started in earnest  --  Goldtoothmeant to come in . Why ? for the gods ' sakes , when he was safe and secret out where he was ? Why leave cover , Goldtooth ? What are you up to  --  friend of mine ? Another doublecross ? Or did Jik always know you were here ? " Captain , " Haral said , and gave her station-image . " Vid one . That anomaly looks mahen-type . " Pyanfar looked . The brightness among the dull grim shapes of kifish vessels resolved itself . It was indeed another ship of mahendo'sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dock  --  or a hani . Closer and closer . Pyanfar wiped her eyes . Fool , stay awake , stay alert , or you wo n't have to worry . Kif-taint had permeated the bridge . Her nose twitched in the promise of a sneeze . She restrained it , and it crept up again and erupted . She wiped her nose . Another revolution . Aja Jin and Vigilance and one bright-shining ship too many . " That 's about berth 18 or 20 , " Haral said . " I 'd sure like to know what it is . " " So would I , " said Pyanfar . Ask Jik , Haral meant . But Jik was not saying anything about the discrepancy . No one was talking . Neither Jik nor Vigilance . " Put in a call to Vigilance . Ask them to confirm status dockside . " " Aye , " Hilfy said , and it went . Pyanfar bit at a hangnail and watched Kefk station in its slow turning at the highest magnification The Pride could use . Definitely mahen-type craft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten through unscathed : it would take phenomenal luck for even hair-triggered kif guard stations to stop a through-bound starship that meant to jump out again without pausing . There was small chance a sedentary force could fire anything that could intercept a high-V transit  --  unless they were virtually in its path . That was the nature of stations . That was their vulnerability . And the vulnerability of ships that shed V and went to dock.  | " Message from Vigilance , " Hilfy said . " They confirm . Central 's secured . They indicate we 're to come ahead with caution . " " Thank them , " Pyanfar muttered absently . They have n't noticed ? Ehrrancame into a kif station denied a shiplist and never tried the vid ? Jik did n't ? In a mahen hell . Jik knows there 's a ship here that does n't belong . And Rhif Ehrran ca n't be that much of a fool . What are they together on ? Do they know that ship ? She fired retros . Hard . " Huhhh ! " Haral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're off-pattern , " Tirun said calmly then ; and Hilfy : " Message from Kefk , from our escort , they query  --  " " We just missed a rock , " Pyanfar said . " Tell them sweep their lousy lanes , huh ? " " We going to take a look at that ship ? " Haral asked , having figured it out for herself . " Gods-be right we are . " She had just thrown The Pride off the autoapproachtiming with the station 's revolutions . Now they had to revise their figures and fuss about with revised lane-assignment and approach . A few judicious pulses might put them closer to station on a timing that would swing that surplus ship under the camera 's scrutiny . " Gods , " Haral said , " priority , priority  --  we show that knnn 's engines live on the rim . " " Gods be . " Pyanfar scanned a ripple of new information across her screens , heard Khym talking urgently on one channel while Hilfy queriedthe other  --  " We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jik says  --  "  --  a new image came up .

" I 've got translator on it , " Hilfy said . " Our tc'a escort 's talking to the knnn . " " Kefk transmission , " Tirun said . " Methane-side 's talking on several wavelengths . " " Keep going , " Pyanfar said and gnawed her mustaches . " We keep on approach until they try to stop us.

They 're scheduling us on in . " " Knnn ? " Tully asked . " What do , what do ? " " Hush , " said Chur . " Quiet . It 's not . . . not ... doing anything , it 's just out there . " " We 're just going on in , Tully . Quiet . " " Kkkkt . Kkkkkt . Kkkkkt . " " Shut up . " From Tirun . " Or we give you to it . " " Easy , easy , " Pyanfar muttered . " Chur  --  you all right ?

" That 's match with the  --  Tc'a 's moving . There 's the knnn  --  " " Track it . Get vid . " " Trying , " Haral said . " Gods-be  --  " Image came up , magnified in a series of jolts , the tc'a 's jumbled planes in its running lights and floods : the flare of fire where the knnn was  --  no running lights , no numbers , no names : the knnn took no care in navigation at all and obeyed no lanes . It was out there , that was all  --  it showed on scan . Fire showed . Braking . " That 's intercept with the tc'a , " Geran reported . " Minus 23 , 22 , 21  --  " Goldtooth was back there  --  minutes outside the timeline and taking cues from what old information got to him . He might have spotted the knnn by now . Might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them . Slowing down  --  continuing at V  --  anything was potential provocation with a knnn . Pyanfar gnawed her mustaches and spat them out again , her heart pounding against her ribs. " .. .. 3 , 2  --  Priority . " Scan image came up . The knnn was moving into pattern with thep142tc'a . Was matching V with it  --  that quickly , that easily . Dead stop to course-reverse : metal could never stand it . Bodies would flatten . Tully muttered to himself . It sounded like oaths , a steady drone of them . The tc'a and knnn began to accelerate together , the joint blip moving faster and faster away from the station vicinity . " Gods , " Geran muttered , " they 're going , they 're going . Plus 10 , 25  --  Look at that ! " The other way . The knnn was heading outsystem , nadir with the tc'a either grappled or close in pattern . Colors shifted on the scope , incredibleacceleration . " Ah ! " Tully said . " It 's jumped ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Pyanfar snapped . Nothing had stopped , least of all The Pride hurtling inbound to station and the chrono flicking numbersdown . It was over . The tc'a was gone . Lost . And Nav-comp was flashing red lines on second monitor . " Off the mark , off the mark , gods rot it , Haral -- I want that flyby . Get that equipment up , get it , hear ? " " Aye , aye , up and coming . " " We are observed , " Skkukuk said faintly . " Kkkkt . The methane folk , I warned you . Pull us out of here . Kkkt . Fools . " " Shut up , " Tirun said . " There is no profit to this ! " " Skkukuk , " Pyanfar snarled , " shut it up . " Silence then . The beep and click from instruments went on . Kif ships talked to each other . "  --  honor to the hakkikt , " the station took up the refrain again , " there is no damage . We are secure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahijiru , incoming , silence , while the knnn business unfoldedon Goldtooth 's timeline . " Stand by , " Pyanfar said , " Tirun , I want that approach caic . Take stats and set me up again . " " Got it , got it , I 'm working . " And a little later , when station handed revised schedules down the line : " Bastards ! I just had that ! " " They 're not going to bump us down-schedule , " Haral said . " They 're going to revise the whole list of ships behind us . They want us in before the kif just real bad , do n't they ? " No one answered . " Run that schedule , " Pyanfar said . " Can we do it ? Are they going to route us blind to that ship again ? "  | " We got it , we got it , " Tirun said after a moment , and a course plot came up . Closer then and closer . Vid clarified . One full revolution of Kefk station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ship , " Pyanfar muttered . " Digitalrecord . If we miss it on sight we 'll try that . " The station revolved slowly past The Pride 's dome cameras . No need of amplification . The serial numbers showed plain on the next station revolution , on a bright vane column . Hani ship . 656 YAAV . " Moon Rising , " Haral muttered . " That 's Moon Rising . Tahar ! " Oaths went through com all over the bridge . Pyanfar sat silent . Not surprised , no . It fit . It fit very well . So how large does this party get ? How did Goldtooth know to meet us here ? Gods , what have I got us into ? It was the red trousers , a dash of perfume enough to mask the sweatingshe was likely to do in hours ahead  --  Pyanfar took time for that , with The Pride only tentatively in dock . Shielded com line and personnelaccessway connections were still all that any of their ships took from station , and station dockers made weak protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they swallowed it . Sikkukkut 's ships stayed ready to move ; and so did they . It was not vanity , this scrub-down : one of them ought to look and smell presentable to kifish hosts , and she made feverish haste about it . Three of them were off-shift at the moment . She had gotten Chur to rest , over protests she should go on sitting duty while her captain took showers ; " Up , " Pyanfar had said , and Chur disengaged herself and headed down the corridor from the bridge to Khym 's cabin , wobbling as she walked . The wrapped bandage about Chur 's side had gone looser , her drawstringed trousers tending perilously low on the hips . " Get her bedded down and fed , " Pyanfar ordered Geran , laying a hand on Geran'schair-back . " See she 's all right , huh ?  --  - Khym  --  " She paused for more assignments , reviewing what useable crew she had : the **26;14018;TOOLONG out wrong , but she took what there was . " Khym , you get the galley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And : " Aye , " Tully said with never a flinching on his part and only an unreadable look from Khym as he got out of his chair and headed galleyward . Pyanfar came pattering out of her quarters still damp , still putting on her bracelets as she headed down the main corridor bridgeward . Tullyp144was coming out of Chur 's cabin , having brought food in , she supposed . " She all right ? " Pyanfar asked . Tully laid a hand on his side . " Hurt , " he said in hani , and by his look had more to say he did not trust the translator for . He blocked her path . Gestured at the door . " See . Go see , captain . " " Huh . " She lowered her ears . Tully tended to anxieties : deaf to most that went on , he got the wrong of most crises . There was no time at present for them or him . But the worry was quiet this time , anguished ; and Chur  --  " Get , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the worst of them save the kif . " I 'll see about Chur . Go . " " Chur  --  " He refused to be moved . " Pad hurt . " " Get ! " She waved a half-hearted blow to be rid of him , turned and punched the door control . Geran turned from Chur 's bedside as the door hissed back , quick and quick about getting her ears up and her face composed . Chur lay there with one arm on the covers . Indeed things were not right  --  not right , Chur 's listlessness . Not right , the tray sitting on the table , untouched by a spacer just out of jump . " How 's she doing ? " Pyanfar asked and let the door shut . " She 's pretty tired , " Geran said . " Fine , " Chur said . " Sure . Sure , you are . You 're not working next jump . " Pyanfar caught Geran 's eyes with a glance . I 'll talk to you later . And to herself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Huh ? I do n't care if she does n't want it . " " Right , " Chur said , and stirred in bed . She propped herself up on her arms . " My side 's doing a lot better . I 'm a lot better , swear I am . " Pyanfar walked up to her bedside and swiped a hand across Chur 's shoulder . Dead fur came away . Too much of it . " I 'll see to her , " Geran said . " Captain , she 's all right . She 's doing all right . Just a little drained . " Pyanfar laid her ears back and wiped the hand on her trousers . " Take care of her , " she said . " Chur , you stay put , hear me ? " " I 'll be fine , captain . " Pyanfar stood there a moment . It was a conspiracy of silence . Chur and Geran  --  Chur always the busier one of the sisters , the cheerfullest , quickest wit.  --  the ancient hall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dothon Chanur . The day the cousins had come down from their mountain home to apply to Chanur for domicile -- Chur answering always , laughing , dissembling a rage at fate andp145the fall of Anify to its new lord . Geran dour and grim ; and letting Chur do the talking , letting Chur make light of the awful decision to desert their own new lord to his folly . " Lord Chanur , that man 's a fool , " Chur had said . " And worse , he 's boring . " While Geran sat silent as a gravewraithand tongue-tied in her wrath.  --  Geran looking to Chur when Pyanfar spoke to her now ; brief answerand a reflexive glance Chur 's way  --  Cover for me , sister , talk for me , deal with themGeran had come out of her reticence once she took to space and freedom : she had found her own competence , learned to laugh , learned to deal with strangers , swaggered with rings in her ear and a spacer 's easy grace . But suddenly it was Chanur 's hall again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Chur doing the thinking and Geran with the knife . Conspiracy . And it was clear again who in that pair ran it all . " Huh , " Pyanfar said . " Huh . " Chur beckoned for the tray on the table . Her ears were up . Geran moved the tray to Chur 's lap . " She 's all right , " Geran said. l Pyanfar walked out and closed the door . She punched the pocket corn . " Hilfy  --  are we still all right up there ? " " We 're all right , " Hilfy 's voice came back from the bridge , even while Pyanfar walked . " We got a call from Jik , just told us take it easy , he 's handling what needs be ; Goldtooth 's on a leisurely approach and he 's in no great hurry to make dock as long as things are the least bit unsettled . No one 's doing much right now , they 've got a little set-to in the methane side got a couple of tc'a/chi locals in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The kif are n't talking about it . At least there are n't any more knnn in port , and things are getting calmed down over there on methane-side , it sounds as if Gods hope . " Pyanfar overtook the voice , walking onto the bridge , and wrinkled up her nose with the pungent aroma of the kif . Skkukuk lay listless and neglected in his chair , still secured , a mere heap of black , while Hilfy and Tirun fended calls and Haral ran ops . At least his chatter had stopped . The kif was one more problem on her mind . One more neglected and suffering piece of protoplasm . She paused by the kif , her hand on the chairback . Skkukuk turned his long jawed head and gazed at her with red-rimmed eyes . " Kkkkt . Captain . I protest this treatment . " " Fine , fine . " The ammonia reek was overwhelming . She felt pity and loathing at once . And a desire to sneeze . " Hilfy , Tirun , go offshift  --  getp146this kif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " She let go the buckle of Skkukuk 's restraints herself and hauled on the kif 's bound arm . " U " Skkukuk cooperated , as far as the edge of the seat . " Captain , " he said . And plummeted through her hands . Pyanfar recoiled as Skkukuk hit her legs and folded the rest of the way down onto his face in a blackrobed , ammonia-smelling heap . Hilfy and Tirun rose from their chairs and Haral looked and quickly swung back to business . " Gods , " Pyanfar muttered , between dismay and disgust , and squatteddown as the kif began to stir and Tirun moved to help.  --  Chur . Chur lying abed , the hair peeling from her skin , Chur , of the red-gold coat , the shining mane that got second looks from every man she met  --  fading out . Wasting under their eyesShe grasped the kif 's thin , robed shoulder and remembered jaws that could bite wire in two . It was a shoulder hard as stone . " Watch it , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Skkukuk levered himself up on one elbow and his bound hands . His hood had fallen back . He lifted his bare head in a dazed way , blinking and looking from her to Tirun . " Get him water , " Pyanfar said . Hilfy stood there . It was Tirun who got up and went . " Get your hands back from it , aunt , " Hilfy said . It was , reckoning those jaws , only sensible advice . " Help me , " Pyanfarsaid , got a grip on the shoulders of Skkukuk 's robe and hauled the kif upright . " Get his feet . " Hilfy grimaced and gathered the knees up ; the two of them heaved the kif into the chair he had fallen from . Tirun came back across the bridge in haste , bringing a cup of water . Pyanfar took it and held it under Skkukuk 's mouth . His tongue darted and the water level dropped to a last soft gurgle as the cup emptied . Then he leaned his head back against the headrest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyanfar muttered . " Get to galley  --  get something thawed . " Tirun left again in haste ; and she put an unwilling hand up Skkukuk 's sleeve and felt the abnormal chill of his arm . " He 's gone into shock , that 's what . Gods rot , I do n't want to lose him . " Hilfy looked at her in a guarded , hostile way . " You want him ? " Hilfy asked coldly . " I by the gods do n't want him dying like this . Come out of it , niece . Is that my teaching  --  or something you learned in other company ? " Hilfy 's ears went back . Nostrils flared and pinched . And Hilfy turned and walked away to the corridor with business-like dispatch.  | " Where do you think you 're going ? " " To fix your gods-be kif , " Hilfy snapped . " Captain . By your leave , ker Pyanfar " " Niece  --  " Pyanfar muttered . But what she had was Hilfy 's back as Hilfy headed away down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gods . Gods be . " She unwound the flex which had bitten into the kif 's wrists . His hands were cold and limp , and he regarded her hazily , unresponsive to a fight among hani that might have greatly amused him on a better day . " Kkkkkt . Kkkkt , " was all the sound he made in his misery . Shut up , they had told him when he had begun to make that noise , Khym came in from the galley and stood there with his ears back . Tully came in after him , and stood observing the situation with one of those inscrutable expressions that evidenced something going on in his blond-maned head . Perhaps , like Hilfy , he wanted the kif 's death . Perhapshe was afraid , or wanted to warn them of the danger in this creature , and lacked words to do it . " Get cleaned up , " Pyanfar snapped at them both . " You think we got time to stare ? Gods-be kif 's wilted on us , that 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go . Get to it . The rest of us are waiting on you . " " Food  --  " Tully said lamely , and pointed back at the galley . " Come on , " Khym said , and caught him by the arm and took him on through the bridge to the corridor . Tully went , with a backward look from the bulkhead doorway . " Get ! " Pyanfar said . " Captain , " Haral said from her post . " Harukk calling . The hakkikt advises us the guard stations have officially surrendered . " " Thank the gods for that . Acknowledge . " " Aye . " Tirun came back from the galley , carrying a cup of chopped raw meat that reeked of thawing and chill even at arm 's length . " Kkkkt , " Skkukuk moaned , and averted his face when Tirun offered it . Pyanfar scowled . " Shut up and eat it , hear me , kif ? I have n't got time for your stupid preferences . " " Kkkkt . Kkkkt . Kkkkt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup from Tirun 's hand and held it under Skkukuk 's mouth . " Eat it . I do n't care what you do n't like . I have n't got time for this . " " Kkkkt . " And the jaws clamped together with a swelling of muscle down their long length . The nostrils drew inward . Skkukuk gave a long shiver , and kept his face averted , his eyes shut , his throat spasming.  |p148Pyanfar  took the cup back . " He eat anything we gave him before jump ? " " I 'm not sure , " Tirun said . " A lot of it had dried up . " " Captain , " Haral said , " We got a definitive whereabouts on that stshothat went out from Mkks : kited through here this morning and never stopped for hellos . " " Gods rot . Naturally it did . What 's happened to Tahar ? Any word on Moon Rising ? " " Make inquiry ? " Haral said . " Has anyone else ? " " Negative . " " Gods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't you ? No . Do n't ask . Just go on listening . " " Maybe we ought to ask the hakkikt advice in kif-feeding , " Tirun muttered at her side . " Captain  --  maybe if we ask the kif to get some-thing  --  " Pyanfar turned a flat-eared look on her and Tirun tucked the stinking cup back into her hands and covered it and shut up . And Hilfy came back from down the hall . With another cup in hand . " He eat anything ? " " No . " Hilfy offered hers . It smelled of blood . It was . Pyanfar drew in her nostrils as Hilfy extended it past her face . " Where in the gods ' good sense did you get this ? " " Med stores , " Hilfy said , ears back , jaw set . There was already a twitch of kifish nostrils . The head turned , the eyes opened and a desperate tongue investigated the air . Skkukuk lifted his own hands to cup Hilfy 's holding the vessel ; and the darkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's long jawmuscles . " Good gods , " Tirun said . " Just selective , " Hilfy said . " A real delicate appetite . Freezerstuff 's just too far gone for him . " " Get him cleaned up , " Pyanfar said . " Feed him again if you have to . But do n't by the gods get generous . We need those supplies . And you  --  " Reprimand died in her mouth and left a bad taste after . Hilfy was on the edge . She saw it in the look in Hilfy 's eyes , the set of her jaw . " Get some rest , " she said to Hilfy ; and that brought Hilfy 's ears down as quickly as a blow to the face would have . " I 'm fit . "  | " Are you ? " Hilfy said nothing . The ears stayed down . The eyes stayed dark . Get him off this ship , off my deck , send him back to Sikkukkut . Gods , gods , gods , the med supplies . How often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kkk-t , " Skkukuk breathed . Pyanfar looked at the kif , and saw already a focus to the eyes as Tirun made shift to move him out of the chair . " Kkkkt , " he said softly , " kkkkt  --  " - trying to get his booted feet under him . His head came up and the reddened eyes looked at Pyanfar . He knew what he had drunk . After the rest of it , are you , kif ? Tirun got him on his feet . Hilfy took an arm and they led him away , slowly , holding onto him and holding him up at the same time . Ought to bind those jaws when we handle him . There was a patch on her left arm where the fur grew wrong : plastic surgery , once and long ago , in her wilder youth . Wonder if he 'd smother  --  the nostrils run close to the surface . Gods , get him off my ship , that 's all ! And get Hilfy away from him . " Going to give that bastard to Jik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by Haral 's side . And before Haral could venture commentinto a family situation : " Go on . Get yourself cleaned up . I can handle things solo a while . We 've got enough gods-be problems . I do n't know how long we 're going to be in this port . Not long , I 'll guess . Hours , maybe . Maybe a day or so . With luck . " " Aye , " Haral said , no demur , no comment , and no delay in shunting things to her board and bailing out of her seat . " Anything you need below ? " " Negative . Just hurry at it . Send Hilfy and Tirun to the same when you see them . " " Aye . " Haral headed off at all deliberate speed . Throw water and soap on herself , pull on fresh trousers , stagger back to the galley if there was time and get food in her belly . None of them carried any spare fat nowadays . A gaunt and haunted look hung about all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in snatches , while jump after jump burned them up from inside . There was a physiological penalty for every jump . The kif paid it . They did . She found herself eating from knowledge that she had to , not because food appealed to her , when she should have been ravenous . Only the wobbles signaled need for food : no appetite . Another jump  --  gods , another jump and we 'll begin to feel it for sure . No one can stand this schedule.  |p150Chur   --  ca n't . I was a fool to listen to her at Kshshti . She 's in serious trouble , thinner and thinner . Bone and hair goes next . Bowel function . Kidneys . Heart , It 's not only kifish fire that can kill us . We ca n't run now . If anything goes wrong here we ca n't pull out . Chur needs those hours . Needs days here . Get a med ? Whose ? No . No . Chur 's on the mend . The side 's healed . The jump took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . Feed her vitamins . Lots of red meat . She 'll make it now . She 's past the crisis and she 's still got reserves . But I shed a lot . The kif collapsed . Pyanfar tongued a sore spot in her mouth , a tooth that promised soreness after brushing . So we 've been running hard . Gods-be kif wilted after one jump . We 've been  --  gods , how many jumps on short rations and short sleep ?  --  and we 're still holding on . We need a hani med , gods rot it . Not mahendo'sat , someone who knows what the margin is . And hani medical personnel are scarce out here . If I ask Vigilance -- In a mahen hell . But her hand punched through to ship-to-ship while her mind was still arguing the matter , " Vigilance . This is The Pride of Chanur , PyanfarChanur speaking . Put me through to your med staff . " ( Gods , Chur 's going to chew sticks if we call over a Vigilance med . But by the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like that look in her . ) " Pride of Chanur , this is Vigilance watch . Captain , we have operations in progress . Our boards are busy . I 'll put your request through and call you back " She read between the lines , a big lazy ship with personnel to spare , crew on rest , backup crew on duty , Rhif Ehrran was offshift along with her high officers to shower and sleep and eat at leisure . And not wanting advertisement of their status . Telling their ships ' internal schedules and habits to the kif did none of Ili them any good . " All right , Vigilance . " She shifted to Jik 's channel . " Aft , Jin , this is The Pride . " " Aja Jin here , got all personnel busy . This emergency ? " It 's Pyanfar Chanur , rot your hide , get me Jik ! But that was panic . Jik was in communication with Mahijiru , likely , Aja Jin 's crew up to its noses in running codes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to keep track of that situation and take the whole operations load off Vigilance because they had nop151trust for that ship , and off The Pride because The Pride had no crew available to carry it . " No , " Pyanfar told Aja Jin 's corn officer . " Put it through when things settle down . " There was a delicate question  --  how to get in touch with Jik and get Jik to twist Ehrran 's ear for that medic without being too evident about it . They had made light of the stack of charges Ehrran accumulated . But they needed no more of them . Nothing to complete the pattern and damn them with the han . Follow channels . Do it the safe way . Keep to protocols . There had to be time . Even if that stsho had run for Meetpoint and babbled all gtst knew ; even if knnn were stirring about . Goldtooth and Jik acted as if there were time . They laid plans . Goldtooth was still coming in to dock , which meant he expected at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least personal business here to make the trip worthwhile . But Chur -- Geran 's covering for her , that 's what . And Geran 's scared . So am I. Gods rot it , I never should have let her come past Kshshti . But we needed her . We still need her . Gods , she 's not getting better . She 's worse . Com chatter kept up , Kefk adjusting to the reality of its occupation . Methane-sector was settling down at last  --  only a small portion of Kefk 's territory , but a precinct with which kif did not trifle and out of which little coherent information came : the chaos at least seemed less . And there were no more knnn involved . Geran came back to the bridge . Came and leaned on Pyanfar 's chair , and Pyanfar turned it about to face her . " She all right ? " Pyanfar asked Geran . No . Not all right , Pyanfar thought with a sudden chill . Geran 's mouth was clamped tight , jaw clenched . Tongue-tied again . Like in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Geran 's mouth twist , the strain of her throat , just to get words out . " She could n't keep it down , captain . " " Listen , cousin , I 've already got a call in for a med . " " Aye , " Geran said , and to her surprise made no argument . Then with a look more naked and more wretched : " I really think you 'd better . Captain , she choked pretty bad trying to eat . She 's that weak . She could n't get her breath . " No words for a moment or so . Mortal equations . Points of no return.  |p152Healing  in jump cost and cost , And if the wound drew too profoundly on Chur 's resources and the jump-stretch went onThere was another jump beyond this ; it might come in a day  --  or hours ; and if things went really wrong here , there might be jump and jump and jump with kif on their track and somewhere , somewhen down that course  --  having to send The Pride into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was what they faced . " All right , " Pyanfar said quietly . " All right , we do it . We get that med in here right now . A hani med . Vigilance has got staff . I 'll get one . i do n't care what it takes . " Another convulsive effort to speak . " Let me . Captain , let me . " And quietly , the dam broken : " Begging your pardon  --  but maybe I can talk to staff , go the quiet route , huh ? Kin-right . " Without the arrogance of captains involved , Geran meant . " Do it , " Pyanfar said without rancor . " They 've got a com-hold on . You 'll have to get past it . " " Aye . " Geran took com one post , sat down and went on the corn , quietly , urgently . It was not a thing Pyanfar cared to listen to  --  Geran pleading Chur'scase with an Ehrran crewwoman who wanted to argue channels in the matter of a Chanur life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Gods , I do n't carewe 've got to get a hurry-up on this . But it was more likely Geran couldI win it . Doubtless it would come to captains and her having to plead with Ehrran personally before all was done ; but something still had to be sacred among hani  --  like kin-right and the bond between sisters . A ship incoming with family crisis on Anuurn outranked all other traffic . A woman homebound in such events could board any plane , commandeerany conveyance without stopping for formalities like fares till later . Kin-right could unsnarl red tape , overcome barriers , silence opposition and objections . There was law higher than han law . There had always been . Vigilance had to respect that . " Captain . They want your request on file . " Pyanfar turned the chair and met an anguished stare with a quiet one before she took the call . " This is Pyanfar Chanur , " she said to com . " Chanur . " It was Rhif Ehrran in person . " You want your crewwoman transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do it . " Gods , to put Chur in Ehrran hands . " I 've got a next-of-kin request , ker Rhif . " Humbly . Quietly . With as much of Chanur dignity as she could save . " Geran Anify par Pyruun : she 's got the right to go with her sister if she has to be taken off . " You'llp153have an able Chanur loose on your ship if you take them , you eggsucking Ehrran bastard , no luck getting your hands on one of us helpless and undefended  --  and we 'll be two crewwomen down , blast your eyes , and you 'll have two hostages and you know it . " I 'd take it kindly , captain , if you could get a little speed on this . She 's pretty sick . " A long delay . " Dispatch the case records . Such as you have . My medicalstaff does n't work on suppositions . " " You know I have n't got a medical staff , Ehrran . " " You expect me to take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release from Geran Anify as next of kin and from you as clan senior here before my staff touches her . " " You 'll get it . " Cover your backside , you gods-be parasite . Protect yourself You give me the chance and it wo n't be a lawsuit when I go for you . " With respect , can we get this underway ? We do n't know how long we 've got in this port . " " It 's waiting on that release , Chanur . Or if you 'd rather have the mahendo'sat or the kif see to your problem  --  " " We 'll get your release . Thank you , ker Rhif . I owe you one . " The contact went discourteously dead . " Gods fry her , " Geran muttered . " By the gods , " Pyanfar said , turning and matching Geran 's look with one of her own , " we owe her one , Chanur owes her one for this . " " Aye , " Geran rasped . The breath came from the depths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hearth and blood , captain . When we get a chance . " " When . " Pyanfar flicked her ears . Rings chimed , reminder of voyagesand experience . They dealt with an Immune . Unchallengeable , by every principle of civilized law . But Chanur was older than any Immuneclan . Older than Ehrran in all senses . " Get that release . Get Khym in here . And get the automed and relay Chur 's vital signs over to Vigilance ; let 's give the meds all the help we can and save the Ehrran for our own time , not Chur 's . " Khym came onto the bridge and got to legal files ; Tully strayed through the door : " Here , " Pyanfar said , called Tully over and leaned aside in her chair to fish a size three probe out of the under-console toolkit . She extended one claw in demonstration , punched a harmless button with the probe while Tully watched , and turned and slapped the probe into his palm . His blue eyes lighted with sudden understanding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Chur help , " she said . " Meanwhile we need crewman , huh ?  |p154Understand  ? Buttons . Controls . Gods , you ca n't read . Use your imagination . Go to Khym , tell him you do what he says , can you ? " " I understand , " he said . " I do . I work , I help . " " Good for you . " She patted an available leg and sent him off , the halt to help the inexperienced , and both to do what they could . Gods , gods . She dropped her head against her hands and wiped her mane back . She was shaking with fatigue . She heard someone else come onto the bridge . Geran had come back with stats from the little medical equipment they had , and she flung herself into Haral 's vacant seat to put the data through to Vigilance , no motion wasted . Gods know how long we 'll be here . Geran guesses the risk we 're at if we have to run for it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all now . Or thinks she 's dying anyway and wo n't burden us with helping her . Gods-be stubborn hillwomen . We go to space . We never get home out of the blood . Gods , gods  --  There had been a look on Geran'sface for a moment in the dealings with Vigilance , a look such as she had seen on Hilfy 's with the kif , and neither expression looked much toward personal survival . Her own heart beat hard when she thought on Ehrran , when she reflected on herself , on a fool who had gotten a little ship and a merchant crew involved in the affairs of Personages and hakkiktun and gods forbid , the knnn . There was nowhere left to run but home , nothing but charges and challenge there , and no way with a sick woman aboard to do that running without killing her . They could get back to Mkks from here . Or reach Tt'a'va'o , in space no hani had ever visited and where no hani was welcome ; or run for Meetpoint  --  where The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hides . Chur might not live to get to any of those places and The Pride itself might not last much longer than their arrival . She gave her mane a second wipe , flicked the rings on her ears into order and listened to Geran getting the data through and insisting on an acknowledgement from the Ehrran medical staff . Haral came back onto the bridge , still wet from her bath , as Khym got up from his board and quietly handed Geran the legal release for fax-transmission to Vigilance . " What 's underway ? " Haral asked . " Getting a Vigilance med over here , " Pyanfar said quietly ; and Haral 's damp ears went back in quiet acknowledgement . Haral knew who ; why ; was relieved , and avowed she had not been worried it would get done , all in that one twitch . It comforted her , such friendly familiarity , close as her own mind . There had been times in their youth whenp155she and Haral had come to blows . Never on The Pride 's deck . Never since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's controls . " Chur 's not so good , huh ? " Haral asked . " Not critical , " Pyanfar said , " but none too good . It 's not now that worries me . " Haral added up other upspoken things right too , with a scowl for their luck and Chur 's and for allies they had to rely on . " Goldtooth 's on  --  "  --  insertion approach , Pyanfar started to say , and corn started flashing an attention-light . She reached and leaned over the mike . " Pride of Chanur . You 've reached the captain . " It was neither Ehrran nor Jik . It was the tinny putter of the shieldeddockside line . "  --  kokkitta ktogotki , Chanur-hakto . Kgoto naktki tkki skthokkikt . " " Gods rot it , I 'm not opening that hatch . " " kohogot kakkti hakkiktu . " " Not even for him . " " Khotakku . Sphitktit ikkti ktoghogot . " " Speak pidgin ! " " Gift . From the hakkikt . " Pyanfar drew in a long breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Do n't ask me , that look meant . You know what choice we 've got . " I 'm coming , " Pyanfar said into the coin . " Kgakki tkki , skku-hakkiktu . " Politeness grated . And when the contact was broken : " Gods , what else did we need ? Khym . Tully . Haral and I are headed for the lock . Get on the corn and tell Tirun and Hilfy meet us down in lowerdecks  --  armed , and hurry it . Geran : get that camera on . " She flung herself to her feet as Haral headed for the weapons-locker . " And , Khym , when you 've done that get on shortrange and advise Jik we 've got kif arriving with presents at our lock . Do n't use the station lines ! Hear ? " " Aye , " Khym said , and shifted himself into Hilfy 's vacant place , already throwing coin switches . No argument . Gods , the menfolk had settled in and become useful  --  somewhere something had happened , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to move on its own impulse . She took the light pistol Haral handed her , checked the safety in haste and headed out of the bridge a step in front of Haral . " Gifts , " Pyanfar muttered as Haral overtook her in the main corridor . " Gifts ! That 's how we got into this godsforsaken mess in the firstp156place . Knnn . Chur sick . Vigilance playing games . And a gods-be kif wants to give us presents . " With Goldtooth in the last stages of his docking approach , they were losing their free-space shield ; and from here on , it was stand prepped for a hasty undock and a mad scramble for defense at any moment . They had caught station with its defenses low . It was an easy trick to take a starstation out  --  a few C-charged rocks carried through jump and let fly  --  if an attacker had no scruples . And , she kept recalling , Akkhtimakt 's reputation included none , even among kif.  |p157Tirun  and Hilfy met them in front of the lift lowerdecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid back and both of them wetterthan Haral had been . " What have we got ? " Tirun asked as they headed down the corridor to the lock . " We got a present coming from Sikkukkut , " Pyanfar muttered , and gave a look Hilfy 's direction ; Hilfy showed nothing now but a cleareyedattention to business . " That 's what they say out there , at least ; I did n't like the last present much ; and b'gods , if Sikkukkut gives me another earless hanger-on I 'll feed it to Skkukuk and solve two prob-lems . " " I do n't like this , " Haral said . " I do n't like it at all . Captain , let Tirun and me sort this out in the lock . We might get more kif than we bargained for and they could sabotage that hatch  --  " " Airlock gives them advantage of position , " Pyanfar said . " Geran , you got image on them ? " " No , captain  --  one 's in sight at the bend ; there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light 's lousy . " " Gods-be mess , " Pyanfar muttered . " Stand by , Geran . " A single shot from their airlock toward the accessway might blow them to hard vacuum , even with light pistols ; and Kefk was rife with potential suicides willing to bet their lives hani would hesitate one necessaryinstant to take the opposition with them.  | " We could take it from lowerdeck ops , " Haral said . " Sfik , " Pyanfar said , and took her gun from her pocket and threw the safety off . " Besides , sabotage at that hatch we do n't need . Airlock it is . You and I go in , cousin . Hilfy and Tirun hold the rear and keep your hand on that close-switch . And , Geran , you look sharp up there . " " I 'm on it , " Geran said . Tirun 's ears were back . Tirun had the clear ruthless sense to throw the emergency seal , backup to Geran ; Hilfy was there because Hilfy happened to be belowdecks , and sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Huh , " Tirun said , commentary on it all . They rounded the corner toward the lock . " Geran . Inner hatch only , Geran . " Ssssnnk . The big inner hatch went back on the instant , and the lock glared white with lights . Tirun took up position where the hatch rim gave some cover from fire and a split-second longer survival in an explosivedecompression , her left hand set on the emergency switch . Hilfy stood armed on the opposite side of the hatchway . " Easy , " Pyanfar said ; and walked into the airlock with Haral behind her . " Geran , open her up . " The outer hatch whisked back . A single kif who stood there a distancedown the orange-lighted access , its hands in plain sight . It looked not at all startled at the pair of guns it faced ; and it wisely refrained from all sudden movement . Sikkukkut himself ? Pyanfar wondered . But it was not so tall as Sikkukkut . It smelled different . She caught the different smell of Kefk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , fit to raise the hairs on a hani 's back . Her nose twitched . Gods , I 'm allergic to the bastards- " The hakkikt sends , " it said . " Will you accept the gift ? " " What gift ? " The kif made a slow turn . "  --  Kktanankki ! " he called out . Bring it  --  a word that implied other things beyond bring , like a present that was able to walk under its own power . A faint sound came from further down , around the corner of the accessway . More kif arrived , a massed drift of shadow with the red-gold of a hani in their midst , a hani in torn blue silk breeches . Pyanfar 's heart lurched , first in startlement and then in recognition of that face , the tangled mane with the bronze tone of Anuurn 's southlands ; left ear ripped , a black scar that raked mouth and chin . " Dur Tahar , " Pyanfar said.  |p159The  captain of Moon Rising raised her eyes as the kif brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ears came up and flattenedas the first kif and two more took her inside , under the white light . Her eyes were the same bronze as her mane , wild and hard and crazed-looking . " Pyanfar Chanur , " Tahar said , in a distant , hoarse voice . " The hakkikt gives you your enemy , " the foremost kif said . " His compliments , Chanur . " " Mine to him , " Pyanfar muttered . " Kkt , " the kif said , and turned with a sweep of its robes and left , taking its dark companions with it , in kifish economy of courtesy . " My crew , " Dur Tahar said . Her voice struggled for composure and failed . " For the gods ' own sake , Chanur  --  go after them ! Ask for them ; get them out of there ! " Pyanfar expelled one breath , sucked in a new one and strode out into the accessway in pursuit of the departing kif . " Captain ! " Haral called after her ; but Pyanfar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had view of the down-bound knot of kif on the ramp . " Skku-hakkiktu ! " she yelled after the collective shadow . " I want the rest of the hani ! Hear ? " The kif came to a leisurely halt , and gazed up at her as his band halted around him . " Tell the hakkikt , " Pyanfar called down the icy chute of the ramp , " I appreciate his gift . Tell the hakkikt I want the rest of the hani . I set importance on that . Tell him so ! " " Kkt . Chanur-hakto . Akktut okkukkun nakth hakti-hakkikta . " Something about passing the message on . Modes eluded her , the subtletiesof when or how fast , woven into the words kif used with each other like fine-edged knives . " See to it ! " she yelled back . The kif bowed like a slide of oil , turned and walked on down the ramp with his companions around him . Pyanfar scowled , snicked the safety onto the pistol , then turned and hastened back into the airlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at corn . " And lock her up good ! " The door hissed behind her , and the electronic seals clashed and thumped . " Where are your crew ? " Pyanfar asked Tahar . " Station Central . Last I knew . " Tahar staggered as Haral took her by one bound arm and pulled her through into the warm corridor outside . As she passed , Tahar looked from Hilfy at her left to Tirun at her right ; and with Hilfy whose mother was Faha-clan there was a feud as grievousas Chanur 's own . But Dur Tahar showed not a spark of defiance ,  |p160only  weary acquiescence as Pyanfar pushed her over to stand against the corridor wall . " Get them out ! " Tahar said hoarsely . " Chanur , anything you want , just get them out . Fast . " " Tirun , you got a knife ? " " I got it . " Tirun drew her folding-knife from her pocket , turned Tahar 's face to the wall and sawed through the binding cords that held her hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat  --  stuffed the cut cord into her pocket , spacer 's neatness , while Dur Tahar leaned against the wall , rubbing the blood back into her hands , her eyes glassy with shock . " I sure did n't fancy to meet you under these circumstances , " Pyanfar said . " We were off our ship when you came in . They held us in the offices  --  Gods , I do n't care what you do to me , just get them away from the kif . " " I 'm going to try . I sent Sikkukkut a message out there in the accessway . I 'm not sure I 've got enough credit the hakkikt 's going to listen , but I think I 've got enough it 'll get to him . " Dur Tahar pushed away from the wall . " You can do better than that , Chanur ! " " Listen , you make me trouble , Tahar , you 'll die earless . Hear me ? " " I hear . Just get on it . Talk to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . But that message has to get there before I can do anything . You should know that well as any . I 'm going to call Harukk on corn . Suppose you tell me what you 're doing in port ; where Akkhtimakt is . Maybe you can give me some coin to bargain with , huh ? " Tahar 's mouth tightened . She gestured vaguely outward , elsewhere , anywhere , with a lifting of her eyes . " There . Out there . Kshshti , likeliest . " It was the ghost of a voice . " You want our word , you have it from me . Anything . Just for the gods ' sakes do n't let them die like that . " Pyanfar stood staring at her . Old-fashioned words meant something on Anuurn ; like our word , like clan and law and other things alien to the far dark place they had gotten to , in the modern age of Vigilance and stsho connivance . " It 's a long way from home . A long way , Tahar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shut her eyes . " They 'll turn on you . Mahendo'sat same as kif . They will . Take my example  --  get out of here . Shed all of them and run , Chanur . " " You know a place to run to ? " Dur Tahar opened her eyes and looked at her , such a look as ached with exhaustion and terror and months and years of running . " No . Notp161ultimately . Not if you 're like me . And you 're getting there real fast , are n't you , Chanur ? " It was not a sight any of them would ever have looked for Moon Rising 's captain sitting at The Pride 's galley table up by the bridge , taking a cup of gfi Geran pressed on her . Dur Tahar drank , and Pyanfar sat across the table with a cup in her own hands and more of the crew lounging against the cabinets with whatever bits of food Tully had scrounged : two males in the galley  --  so beaten Dur Tahar was that she hardly spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at Khym . She knew Tully was with us , Pyanfar noted . Or at least knew he might be . So the rumor 's got to Akkhtimakt . Tirun was back on duty , trying to query Vigilance on the medical assistance and get Jik 's attention to the Tahar matter  --  ( " Let me take this round , " Tirun had offered , while Geran was back seeing to Chur . " Do it , " Pyanfar said . And between the two of them : " Put the fire under Vigilance , huh ? Discreetly . Gods rot them . Get some hurry out of them . " ) Khym and Haral and Hilfy and Tully  --  they lounged about the walls , guns on hips , all of them armed but Tully ; and Tahar drank her gfi in silence , eyes at infinity . " I want it straight , " Pyanfar said to her . " I want the whole story , ker Dur . And fast . Tell it to me . " Focus came back , " My crew  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the com lines right now , We 'll begin to get some movement out of the kif soon now . Ships are on short crew , same as us . Even the kif . Your cousins 'll be safe enough for the time being  --  the kif 'll hold off till they 've got some direct order from Sikkukkut , or until Sikkukkut 's free to see to them ; and Sikkukkut'sreal occupied just now . Depend on it . Drink that down . My watch officer 's sending to Aja Jin . We 're doing more than it looks like we are . But you play me for a fool , Dur , and I 'll  --  " " No . " Tahar took a swallow . The cup trembled in her hands . " You run in rough company . This hakkikt of yours  --  " " Not mine . " " he 's winning , do you understand that ? The kif think Akkhtimakt'salready lost . The word 's spreading  --  How well do you know the kif ? " " About as well as serves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , gods , believe me that I do . Sfik . Godsforsaken kif change sides quick as stsho in a situation like this , two kif at the top of the heap and both of them near-matched : Sikkukkut and Akkhtimakt  --   |p162they  both served Akkukkak in different capacities till he went , and now the two of them have all kif space in chaos . Every wind , every whisper that comes along , ordinary kif sniff it and change their politics . And all of a sudden Akkhtimakt 's small stuff . His move against Kita was a big threat ; gods , he 's from Akkht , he 's big stuff there  --  got powerful skkukunhunting down all his rivals on homeworld , while Sikkukkut 's just a jumped-up provincial boss from Mirkti , for the gods ' sake . But the mahendo'sat know him . Sikkukkut 's a longtime neighbor of theirs , someone they 're used to dealing with ; and they 're dealing with him . Do you see ? All of a sudden Akkhtimakt looks like a kif a long way from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own home territory , using old connections , and Sikkukkut 's cut Akkhtimakt bad  - -  thanks to you and the mahendo'sat . Real bad . " Pyanfar leaned her elbows on the table . " Where 's humanity fit into this , huh ? " The whites showed around Tahar 's eyes , a slight tic in Tully 's direction , but Tahar did not turn her head , not even when Geran drifted quietly into the room and stood there with arms folded and her face like boding storm . " Humans , " Tahar said , " are coming in . They 're moving slowly but your ally ought to be able to tell you that . " " Sikkukkut , you mean ? " " This human . Or the mahendo'sat . Akkhtimakt 's program was to stop the human ships ; keep them out of Compact space . Or prey on them one by one on the fringes . Humans are mahen allies , the way the kif read it . But Sikkukkut 's got the mahendo'sat working with him . He 's got you , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sweet sake . Got a pet human of his own . How do you fight a combination like that ? Kefk took one look at that situation and all of Akkhtimakt 's partisans here started looking at their neighbors and refiguring every tie they had  --  I 've been through it before . A kif looks at a situation , adds up his own sfik and whether he 's got any advantage to the other side , and if he does n't , he 'll know his neighbors are adding it up too , and one of them may try to get more sfik by killing him . If he kills his attacker he 's got more sfik for the moment , but if he suddenly gets too much , he may look like a threat and lose all the benefit of it . It 's a bloody game , Chanur . I 've played it for two years . " " Looks like you missed a step , does n't it ? " " Oh , I tried . Kif do n't understand hani , that 's all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crises  --  but they do know we 're different and the way we choose sides is n't predictable or sensible by their lights . So that 's what happened to us . We did n't get a chance to switch sides.  |p163We  were in an office  --  the staff just turned without warning and killed one kif who was too high up  --  too much sfik to trust ; and they rounded up others to hand over to Sikkukkut for  --  o gods . " Tahar shuddered and set the cup down with both hands . " My crew , Chanur , my crew  --  Sikkukkut handed me on for a gift . I 've got sfik enough . The situation has . But my cousins  --  if you do n't get them out of there -- -Chanur , I 've seen what happens when a kif wants to throw a celebration . I 've seen it . " " I 'm working on it . My word on it , Tahar . Gods know I 'd cheerfully break your neck if things were different . But not here and not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got . Want a warm-up on that ? " " No . " " Take it anyway . You can use it . " She retrieved Dur Tahar 's cup , held it for Tirun to fill and set it back in front of Tahar 's hands . " You get news from home ? " Tahar raised her eyes with apprehension . " Short and straight , " Pyanfar said . Gods , it had a bad taste in her mouth when delivering the news once would have been revenge in itself . " Tahar 's in deep trouble  --  but you 'd figure that . I do n't know how bad or how much internally , or what 's going on at Anuurn at the moment , but you could figure it . Tahar was having trouble getting cargoes last year . Victory , Sunfire and Golden Ring are all working over farside , last that I know about it , as far from kif as they can get . If they haul their own cargo , someone raises a question whether it might be pirated goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to post a bond of guarantee in the case they should decide to pirate it themselves . " " Cut it , Chanur ! " " I 'm telling you the truth . What do you expect you 've done for Tahar 's reputation ? Gods rot it , you knew it when you bolted with the rest of the kif at Gaohn ! You might as well listen to it . " Tahar 's ears were back , she set the cup down hard and looked as if she were coming over the tabletop in the next breath ; but then the wind went out of her in a long shuddering sigh , and she bowed her head and flexed her claws out , points on the hard table surface . " You gave me gods-be little choice . Do what ? Come home and face my brother ? Go on running Tahar cargoes after what the kif did to hani at Gaohn ? " " You knew they were kif when you bedded down with them . " " So do you know it . " Tahar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember that . Remember that , Pyanfar Chanur . You ca n't shed your clan . You never can . What you do comesp164back on your kin at home . And kif are kif and hani are hani , and one ca n't trust the other in the end . Get us out of here . Get my crew out and let 's go home , Chanur , for the gods ' sake , I 'm begging you , let 's both of us go home ! " " Captain . " Tirun 's voice came over the com on the wall . " Vigilance is sending : Quote : You 've boarded Tahar personnel . ' I 'm reading it exact , captain . We require you stand &v; to transfer this person to Immune custody . ' " " Gods rot them , " Pyanfar muttered , and slid out of the bench . " Ehrran , " Dur Tahar murmured darkly , and started to her feet in a move that brought Chanur out of their leisured poses all about the galley . Tahar 's ears went flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The law , " Pyanfar said , " They 're here , Tahar . Han law . They 've been hunting you for two years . " " Chanur  --  take my parole ! " Take custody , Tahar meant ; clan to clan . Take her back to Anuurn justice in Chanur custody . It might even one-up Chanur enemies ; and humiliate Rhif Ehrran . That was what Tahar offered , knowing what she offered . It also might backfire . Pyanfar stared at Dur Tahar eye to eye within the half-ring of Chanur crew and the hair bristled down her back . Gods , that I have to be afraid . That one hani has to look at another like this , and worry about the han . She brushed past and headed for the bridge . " Chanurl " Pyanfar looked back , at Tahar with Haral 's hand clamped in a firm grip on her arm . Pyanfar jerked her chin up in a gesture that freed the Tahar captain , turned and walked the narrow , curve-floored corridor to the bridge . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , as she settled into her own chair . " Your two , " Tirun said , and Pyanfar spun her chair about , and punched that channel in on speaker , along with the recorder . " Pyanfar Chanur speaking . " " Rhif Ehrran , " the answer came back , delivered over speaker from the board , as others gathered on the bridge to hear it . " We understand the kif have turned one of the Tahar over to you . " " That 's correct , ker Rhif . Dur Tahar . She 's advised us that her kin are still in the custody of the hakkikt 's forces , and that they 're in immi/nent danger . We made immediate application through all channels for their release . We 're holding her pending a quieter situation on the docks  --  " " You undertook this without notifying us " " The notification to the hakkikt was a matter of emergency . Hani lives are in danger . Regarding the general situation , Tahar showed up at my lock in ldf custody without advance warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secure communication . " " You 're obstructing a han order , Chanur . " " As a matter of record , Tahar has appealed to us to take her parole . " Dead silence on the other end for a moment . Then : " Cooperation , Chanur You do n't take that parole . Hear me ? Hear me ? You want ours , we get yours . You 'll turn her over . " Pyanfar 's pulse skipped . She flicked a glance at the recorder light 's green glow . It was being logged on Vigilance and assuredly she wanted it on The Pride 's tapes . " You 're implying , are you , that our request for medical assistance to injured personnel hinges on our rejecting Tahar 's appeal ? " More silence . The trap was too obvious . Rhif Ehrran was too wary to confirm that with any chance of it being logged verbatim . " Nothing of the kind , Chanur . But I do n't send my crew into a situation I do n't trust . And pending resolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Gods rot you , you 're talking about a critically ill woman and a gods-be short schedule ! You 're  --  " Click , " Gods blast you ! " Tirun 's voice quietly : " Log it ? " " Log it . Log that cut-off , to the minute . " Pyanfar cut the recorder off . She was shaking when she spun the chair about , and her heart hurt her when she looked at the faces about her ; Geran 's face ; and Tahar 's . " Geran , " Pyanfar said quietly , to the killing-rage she saw in Geran 's eyes . And with profoundest shame : " Tahar . I 'm still trying . " " What are they doing ? " Tahar asked in a hollow voice . " Chanur , what 's going on ? " " The law . The law that wants you is telling me they 'll by the gods let Chur Anify die if we do n't hand you over on the spot . That 's what 's happened on Anuurn since Gaohn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spies and note-takers out to prove their case at any cost . Law by innuendo , by threat , by payoff and profit and political gain . That 's what we 've got . Deals with the stsho . Buy-outs and sell-outs . Hani so gods-be anxious to get the advantage of their rivals they do n't see anything else  --  like you and me , Tahar . Like both us gods-be fools . I watched you and you watched me and we fought each other , and our menfolk did , and all the while the old women in Naur and Schunan licked their whiskers and planned how to skin us both . They sent Ehrran out . The stsho found a chink and they 're using it  --  stsho money ; and hani godsbestupidity . Incarnate in Ehrran . By the gods , Tahar , I 'll help your crew , I swear to you . But they 're demanding I turn you and them over to Ehrran . And I do n't see a way out of it . I 've got a sick woman aboard with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the medic that can help her ; and they 're going to play dirty . " " My sister , " Geran said quietly . Her voice achieved a pitch of deep hoarseness it had never reached . And stopped though it was clear Geran had more to say than that . Shame , shame to have a transaction like that to Chanur 's account and Anify 's , and there was nothing else to do . " Chanur , " Tahar said , hands clenched on the co-pilot 's cushion till the claws gouged . " Chanur , I 'm a gift . A kifish gift , hear ? You want the hakkikt to think Chanur ca n't hold what they give you ? " " Gods , you argue like a kif . " " You 're dealing with kif , Chanur . You 're in their station . This is their game . Not the pan 's . Not yours . You give me to the han you lose sfik . And you can lose your life for it . You can lose all you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't send me yet ! Gods , Chanur , if you 're going to throw it all away , at least get my crew out first , while you still have the sfik to bargain with ! " " I 've got a woman sick , I 've got gods-be little time to bargain in . " " They 'll kill you . The kif will kill you if you slip . You hear me ? Where 's Chur Anify or any of you then , huh ? You think Tahar 's the only lives at stake at this gods-forsaken station ? " More silence , profound and dreadful . The crew listened ; Tully 's face was set and pale , for what small amount he followed . " Maybe  --  " Geran 's voice came softly , hoarse and hollow . " Maybe a mahen doctor  --  Captain , maybe Chur 'd be better off with someone not Rhif Ehrran 's pick in the first place . I trust her that little . And I know how Chur feels about it . " What for godssakes has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrowing tunnel in which one course leapt out with white-edged clarity . " By the gods , no ! We 're not taking this from that blackbreeched foot-licker . Tirun ! Get me Jik . " Pyanfar spun her chair about to the board and hit the recorder and the corn . " Priority  --  " Thep167corn came live . " The Pride of Chanur to Aja Jin , priority , priority ; this is Pyanfar Chanur . Get the captain on  --  " And as a mahen voice droned back : " Move it , crewman  --  Tirun , gods rot it , give me those med stats . " She punched buttons , hunting in two banks . " Where in a mahen hell 'd you put that gods-be file ? " " Four , captain , it 's your comp four , I 'm getting it  --  " " Stand by comp transmission , Aja Jin , priority  --  Where 's Jik , gods blast your eyes ! " " I got , " a deeper voice came back . " Jik , get our comp-send and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mahen , hani , I do n't care what , just hurry , code one , hear ? Hurry it , Jik ! " " You got . Ready you send . " She sent , two keystrokes . " Got . We go , go . " " Go ! " She broke the contact and spun the chair about . " Tirun . Log a medical emergency . Log the call . " She leaned back in the cushions and stared at her crew and at Tahar , darkly smug . " There 's more than one way to get something done around here . Now let Ehrran play politics with an emergency call . " It was not safe . Sudden moves in a stationful of nervous kif might open something else up . No move at all was unthinkable . She looked at Geran , whose ears were canted back , whose eyes were white-edged about the amber and black . " So we get Jik in on it , " Pyanfar said . " And by the gods if he can get Blackbreeches to Kefk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Rhif Ehrran likes it or not , and by the gods she 'll do her job . " Geran gave a smile far from pleasant , prim pursing of her mouth . No smile at all from the rest of the crew ; a wary look from Khym ; a warier one yet from Tahar ; and from Tully a lost and worried stare . He laid a hand on Haral 's arm , questioned her with a look . " We get help for Chur , " Pyanfar said in simplicity , for him , and got up from her chair . " Tahar , your crew gets my help nonconditional . I 'm not Rhif Ehrran . If you doublecross me or get in my way I 'll just break your neck right off and send the remains to the kif . And let me make one thing more clear : my crew 's not in any state to be patient with your mouth . We 're short on sleep and gods-be mad , and I do n't know if I 'd save you if you cross one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears went back , a visible flinching . It was the truth , at leastp168the first part . And maybe the second . And Tahar gave no sign of doubtingit . " Better be ready on that access , " Pyanfar said , and turned a look toward Haral . " Tirun , stay your post . You know who you 've talked to . Hilfy , Khym , put Tahar in Tully 's room a while . " It was one of the few places on the ship relatively damage-proof , and it at least had a bed . " Move it . Geran  --  see to Chur , that 's all . " Crew scattered , except Tully . He still had that lost look  --  anxious , frightened . Chur . That was all he could likely make out . Next to Hilfy , the closest friend he had . Pyanfar walked over to him and set a hand on his arm . Claws half out . He had that disconnected look of hysteria , and she gripped his arm to wake him up . " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? " " Tahar , " he said . " Kif . Kefk . What do , Pyanfar ? What do , what do ? " What are you up to ? What kind of game are you playing ? I trusted you . What 's going on , Pyanfar ? " Captain , " Tirun said , " Jik lot 're headed up the dock . Estimate three minutes . Mahijiru queries : assistance wanted ? " " Affirmative . " She left Tully , walked over to Tirun 's side and leaned there . " Kif query , " Tirun said . " It 's Harukk . " Then the minuses of the trick came home to nest . " Respond : medical emergency . Injured crew . " Tirun relayed it . " We have a call already in  --  " Tirun added , reminderto the kif on the other end . And : " We understand that . Will you go on trying ? " Another incoming-light lit . Haral snatched the call . . Right . We got you . We 'll open for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell Hilfy intercept them as they come in . Tully  --  go help Geran . Go to Chur . Take Geran 's orders . " Tully went without question . It was off the bridge , it kept him from underfoot and he could fetch and carry if someone could get it through to him what was wanted . Loyal , she thought ; he was that . Friend . And alien and dangerous as the mahendo'sat when matters got beneath his skin . There was a coming and going belowdecks , grim mahen personnel bristling with weapons taking up station in the accessway , along the lowerdeck main corridor and at the lift . And on the upperdeck main , where a frowning Ehrran medic worked with a tall black Ksota mahendo'sat , and Chanur 's off-duty and motleyp169assortment standing grim and glowering round the walls of Chur 's sickroom  --  two males , either one of whom might have raised the Ehrran'shackles for completely different reasons ; Geran Anify and Hilfy Chanur , Hilfy standing there with her hand consciously or unconsciouslyon the butt of a pistol . They went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it was not only the kif that concerned them . Pyanfar hovered by the door , with a complug in one ear , listening to operations as Tirun sorted them past . The medics exchanged surly technicalities . " No gods-rotted good , " the hani said ; and Geran moved closer , hands in her belt and a frown clenching her jaw . " What is n't good ? " " Captain , " the medic protested , not for the first time . " I 'd like this room cleared . " " That 's all right , " Pyanfar said from the doorway . " We 're all friends . I 'm sure Chur does n't mind . " " Get them out of here  --  " With a look at The Pride 's two menfolk . " Why ? " Pyanfar said . " You going to object to your professional colleaguetoo ? "  --  who was male , and mahendo'sat . The hani medic gave a bleak hard stare and turned and laid out supplies . Plainly she did object to males in medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better be good , " Geran said . The medic hesitated with a bottle in her hand . " Mistake might damage your career real bad , " Hilfy said , hand still on the gunbutt . " I did n't come here to take abuse and threats from junior crew . " " Better be right , " Chur said for herself , rousing herself to tilt herhead back on the pillow and look at the drip stand the medic-assistantswere setting up by her side . " Mahe , haosti . " Check it , will you ? " Shishti , " the mahe agreed . The hani medic glared , and handed the bottles and the bags over to the mahe one by one . " Seals , " the hani said , pointing out the tops . " This woman never should have left Kshshti . By the gods she never should have sat a post  --  " " You going to quote us another regulation ? " Khym asked in his deep rumble . " I 'll quote you laws . Like criminal negligence , malpractice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Huh , " Pyanfar said , and leaned on the doorframe and turned with it at her back until she was in the hall.  | " Captain , " the voice came from corn . " Medic down with Skkukuk says he 's fit enough . Says we got a diet problem with him , they want to send some stuff over . " " Live ? " " They say  --  well , the things are real dumb and they breed fast . " Pyanfar grimaced . The skin between her shoulders drew tight . " Vermin , huh ? What 's it eat ? " A moment of silence . " I 'll ask . " She rolled back around the corner and looked into the room . Looked askance again when the lift door opened down the corridor and let in another band of mahendo'sat . For one moment the grim look of them sent Pyanfar 's hand instinctively to the gunbutt . Then recognition took over , and she flung herself from the doorframe and strode down the dead middle of the corridor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyanfar  --  " He was a black mahendo'sat , and he came in the somber black of his companions , not a flash of gold except when he smiled wide and glittery . He towered there in that dark company on whom the only metal was the black sheen of AP guns and belts and buckles . And the grin died a fast death . " Say Chur she all right , huh ? " " No thanks to you , you rag-eared bastard ! " She jerked the corn-plug from her ear and looked up at his black , worried face . " I got my tail wrecked at Urtur , got my crew shot up at Kshshti  --  " " Message go . " " Yes , rot you , your gods-be message went . Banny Ayhar and Prosperitytook it on , if she got through alive . " She recalled the open door and the Ehrran medic , snagged Goldtooth by a lanky , powerful arm and dragged him toward her own cabin . " Stay out ! " she snapped at his gunbearingescort as she opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faces of his guards and turned and glared at him in the privacy and soundproofing of her own quarters . " So no more merchant . No more play-acting . This is your real face , huh , huntercaptain ? Leave us a message at Urtur  --  head us at Jik and never tell us . You play games , you earless bastard , and we do the bleeding , all over Kshshti docks . You good-humor me right now and I 'll break your godsbeneck . Where have you been ? " Goldtooth 's small ears were back . He had a different look than he was wont , no humor at all . " You want list ? " His voice was hoarse and quiet , unlike himself . " Jik number one fool , Pyanfar , he fool listen to this kif. "  |p171A  cold feeling settled into her , worse than before . " He 's your friend , gods rot it ! You sent him after me at Kshshti . Did n't you ? " " I send . He friend . He same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe I fool , same . " Goldtooth sought a place to sit down and sank down on her rumpled bed , leaning back on one arm to look at her . " We got trouble , Pyanfar . Fool Jik talk tc'a . Knnn take tc'a .

" " He got no grudge on me . I bring him lot sfik . Same you , hani . Same Jik . Same Vigilance . We give that kif so damn much sfik he eat whole Compact . " It made sense . It made an uncomfortable lot of sense . " So why did you come in ? " The ears flicked . Dark mahen eyes half-lidded . " Maybe I got no more choice . Maybe Jik got whole thing . " A fist closed about her heart . " You 're lying to me , Goldtooth . I 've had enough of it . " Long silence . " Maybe good thing one smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're planning to kill him ?

I tell you truth , Pyanfar . You talk that kif I die real slow . You know same , a ? "  | " Gods , I do n't want to hear this ! Do n't make me your cocon-spirator ! " " Old friend . " " Friend ! " She strode over to her dressing table , unlatched the drawer and searched inside it for a small presentation box . Goldtooth had sat up straight ; she tossed it and he caught it . " What this ? " NI " Expensive present . From Stle stles stlen , your precious friend at Meetpoint . The stsho you told me to trust . A note . Go on . Read it . It 's short .

Same gods-rotted kind of help as Stle sties stlen . Gods fry you , you sent me across the Compact like a gods-be lightning rod for every piece of doubledealing for forty lightyears round !

She stood there staring up at Goldtooth ; breath hung in her throat and the dark was all about them both . She coughed her throat clear and a shiver gathered in her gut and ran outward . " You , " she said finally , " you  --  " 1 " You no fool , Pyanfar . You got brain . You , me , Jik  --  not matter look right ; matter what we do . Akkhtimakt got hani , got stsho ally , he make them fool . Where hani guns , a ? Two , three ship . Stsho got none . Got proverb , hani  --  you go bed with some people half hour you got hundred year kid , and he got kids and they got in-laws . Same make deal with kif when you got no gun . " She stood there silent , staring up at this mahe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kif , he had said . Deal and double-deal . He could do it . Strike at Sikkukkut after the whole fragile structure was built and it would all tumble into chaos again . More lives and ships . More years of hazard . And knnn with their black legs into it , weaving gods-knew-what about the fringes of the Compact , with humans trying to come and go . Mahendo'sat . He 's fighting for mahen survival . His whole species is in danger . And where 's hani survival ? Not , for sure , with Akkhtimakt . She drew a deep breath and folded her arms . " So . So you got me listening , mahe . But you 'd better know this : that tc'a the knnn snatched was n't the only thing we lost out of here . A stsho craft bolted Mkks , and it came this way , full sail for Meetpoint . " " Ah , no . Not Meetpoint . Go out Tt'av'a'o vector . " A small flash of gilt teeth . " Try maybe take short cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships ? " " Xenophobe stsho got big surprise , a ? " " The gods-rotted stsho are cozy with the tc'a , friend . " " Maybe we fix . " " O gods , gods , human lunacy 's catching you 're playing tag with the knnn , you rag-eared bastard ! " " That do be problem , true . " She stared into his dark eyes and had another cold moment of doubt . " More secrets ? Where are the humans going , friend ? Where next ? Here ? Meetpoint ? " Goldtooth 's humor had fallen away like a shed cloak . He gazed atp174her long and thoughtfully . " Maybe we make deal with knnn . Maybe e-qui-librium . Tape you got , tape I give you at Meetpoint , you say Banny Ayhar take on  --  one thing in this tape be knnn record ; hani , we got hope this thing get to Maing To ! . You courier knnn message . " " Good gods . " " Tully  --  he be cover for message . He know . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got paper say he crew of The Pride . You fight save him if you not fight for me . " " You bastard . You son of a  --  " " You listen . " He held up a hand and with the other reached into his belt-pouch . " What 's that ? " " From Jik . You got fine new comp unit downstair , a ? You feed this . Got code sort . You process our private message real good , you get talk to us . Ehrran not got . " " Best present I 've had in a while . " She took it and tucked the envelopeinto her pocket . " Also , " Goldtooth said , " my medic get look stats on Chur Anify ; we got piece equipment we bring aboard . Number one fine she go through jump . Same like be in hospital , give her all she need . " " Gods rot it , why did n't Jik give us that at Mkks ? " " He not got . This from MahUiru . We big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aja Jin , he maybe more fast , Mahijiru got more crew  --  got need have this thing . Save few lives . Now you got need , a ? " He set his hands on her shoulders , hard and heavy . " We settle detail later . I got go , not like be longtime off my ship . Damn lousy place , Kefk . But one thing more I give  --  " He reached into his belt pouch and took some other small thing from it , took her hand and hooked over her finger an earring , with one great perfect pearl . " Best I find . I owe you long time for welders , a ? Come from Llyene oceans , number one most beau-ti-ful . " " Goldtooth  --  Ismehanan-min  --  " But for the second time words failed her , and Goldtooth laid his hand on the door switch . " You fine woman , " he said . " Beau-ti-ful thing belong you . " " Where are they going ? Gods rot it , what 's their route ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door and walked out into the corridor . " Goldtooth , gods rot you  --  " She pursued to the doorway , stopped abruptly as a pair of mahendo'sat came dollying a large polystyrene crate past the door . Goldtooth pressed himself against the wall on the other side of thep175corridor till it passed , waved his hand cheerfully toward the crate that headed for Chur 's room . " There , see , we move quick . I promise . It be done . " He gave an engaging grin . " You trust . You trust , Pyanfar . " " Ismehanan-min  --  " " Chur do fine now , " Goldtooth said definitely , and walked off toward the lift , with a nod of his head gathering up his darkclad crew that hulked along on all sides of him , formidable and irresistible . She stood alone in the doorway with the pearl clenched in her hand . And felt entirely numb.  | " She 's not to get out of that bed , " the hani medic said . The Ehrran 's ears were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stood in the corridor prepared to leave . She looked up at Pyanfar the half-hand of difference in their height . " Whatever you imply about my ethics , captain , I did the best for her I could do , and the mahendo'sat have moved in a gods-rotted expensive piece of equipment she 'll stay hooked up to during jump . It 'll take the load off her heart and kidneys and prevent any more deterioration . With luck  --  " Geran had showed up in the corridor and stood there with a face like thunder . " With luck she even may build back a little on the trip . Depends on a lot of things . You 're lucky this far . So is she . We do n't have that kind of resources . We ca n't buy it . " There was bitterness in the woman , a tight jawed hani anger at outsider wealth , and the laws and agreements between mahendo'sat and stsho that forever shut hani out . And that was an old story Pyanfar well understood . " I appreciate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forbear adding : " And I do understand you , Ehrran . " " Thanks , " Geran said for her part . The word all but strangled on its way out . The hani medic nodded curtly and hitched the strap of her carry-sack higher on her shoulder as the mahen medic came out of the room . " Shep177explain ? " the mahe asked . " I hook up machine , she stay connect . No take off . You get list procedure . I leave supply in cabinet . " " She explained it . Yes . Thank you . Mashini-to , a ? " " A. " The mahe grinned and bowed and swung off down main corridorwith the hani slogging along beside , an unlikely pair headed for the lift . Mahen guards peeled themselves out of the corridor in their wake and followed , Goldtooth 's remaining intrusion withdrawing itself . Geran looked drawn and shaken . Silent even yet . Pyanfar put her hand on Geran 's shoulder . " Hey , she 's going to be all right . Best newfangledstuff Iji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more good news . I do n't think we 're pulling out of here real soon , not like we were afraid we might . Day or so , maybe . Maybe more . We know where Akkhtimakt is ; I just got word from Goldtooth , and it looks like we 're going to have a little chance to breathe . There 's more to it than that , but for Chur 's sake it 's the best news we could come up with on short notice . " Geran said nothing . But her face went defenseless and ordinary as if she had come back to them finally . Pyanfar pressed with her hand and Geran drew a deep breath . " What did Goldtooth have to say ? " " A lot of stuff that takes explaining . " Pyanfar looked in on Chur , leaned there in the doorway of a room which had a great lot of machinerysitting over against the wall ; and a crowd of visitors : Hilfy and Tully and Khym still lingered . " Hey , you , " Pyanfar said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " And as the file passed her in the doorway : " Chur . Cousin , you hear me ? " " Uh ? " Chur lifted her head from the pillow . " We just got a present , a little while to rest . We got a message where Akkhtimakt is and we 've got time for a little R and R. You do n't be getting out of that bed or you walk back to Kshshti . " " Gods-be needles , " Chur said . " I hate needles . " " Got more news for you . You get more of them on the way . Get some sleep , huh ? " " Trying , " Chur said , and shifted in the bed and settled as flat as the tubes and one arm strapped outward let her . Pyanfar shut the door and looked at the somber gathering in the hall . " So what is it , captain ? " Geran asked . " Not something I much want to dump on you right now , " Pyanfar said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not about her . Us . Bridge . Everyone . " The four of them followed her . Tirun and Haral turned their chairsp178about as they walked in . Pyanfar went to her own seat near Haral and leaned on the back of it while the rest of the crew settled on chair-arms and against cabinets . " Haral , Tirun , you catch that business in the corridor ? " " Aye , " Haral said . " Both of us . Good news on Chun , Thank the gods . " " Thank the gods and friends where we have ' em . Such as they are . We got anything essential running now ? " " All right . " She took Goldtooth 's code-strip packet from her pocket and put that down on the counter by her seat , powered her chair about to face the crew and sat down . " Humans are moving out from Tt'a'va'o . I do n't know what route they took ; maybe you do , Tully , but the choices from there are real limited . I 've talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She watched Tully 's face , saw anxiety  --  the least little flicker of his strange eyes . " Humans on the move . And that 's not the worst of it . Goldtooth 's been lurking about Kefk regions keeping the Meetpoint route closed and creating a real difficulty for Akkhtimakt  --  Jik said sometime back that Goldtooth might be up to something hereabouts . But it turns out they do n't check things out with each other real well . It seems Jik took off on his own and made the deal with Sikkukkut . Unauthorized , as it were . Or at least without consulting . Forced Goldtooth 's hand . Tully , I 'll try to use small words . Goldtooth had come in from deep space  --  at least from outside the Compact  --  with Tully aboard , off Ijir . He left Ijir to go its way  --  but he had a duplicate of the message packet Ijir carried . He had Tully . And he had gotten something else  --  some kind of message from the knnn . From the knnn , gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile Akkhtimakt aimed to take Kita Point , while his agents were busy eliminating all opposition on the kifish homeworldsettinghimself up as hakkikt of all the kif , that 's what he was after . And back at that stage , a few months ago , Sikkukkut was no more than a provincial boss from Mirkti  --  with ambitions . Sikkukkut courted his old mahen connections at Meetpoint , approached Goldtooth trying to outflank Akkhtimakt , probing for every weakness he could get  --  Meetpoint'salways a good place for intrigues . A real good place to pick up rumors . And right around that time rumors were running heavy  --  like hani deals with the stsho ; mahen deals -- everybody who was high up enough to get advance warnings was trying to get the best advantage against this new kifish hakkikt . Against Akkhtimakt . " But Sikkukkut had a spy with Akkhtimakt , gods know how orp179where . Undoubtedly he had some stsho on the take at Meetpoint . He knew about the courier-ship falling into Akkhtimakt 's hands . He knew  --  I suspect from his spy with Akkhtimakt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldtooth had Tully aboard . And it was n't too hard to figure Goldtooth had handed Tully to us at Meetpoint , when we showed up with our papers cleared with a gods-awful monstrous bribe from the mahendo'sat . Which we did n't know about . But Sikkukkut may have , " Sikkukkut set us up , deliberately put us in a bind at Meetpoint . He snagged us into his reach , he snagged Ehrran , and Ayhar ; and he steered us out of Akkhtimakt 's trap at Kita . Steered us right for his own front yard , step by step . And snagged Jik by having us in his net , while he was at it . By that business at Kshshti he gathered himself enough sfik to take Mkks on his own ; and now he 's got Kefk . So all of a sudden momentum 's on his side and deserting Akkhtimakt . Akkhtimakt 's supportersare beginning to desert him . Fast . Kifish logic : shoot your formerallies in the back and run for the winning side . Akkhtimakt 's got to be worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this idea mahendo'sat are a lot better off with their old familiar neighbor from Mirkti as hakkikt over all the kif . And Jik got Ehrran in on it ; and he got us . Never mind Mkks ' safety . That was n't all he was after in those negotiations at Mkks . And Ehrran 's on a lot more than Tahar 's track now if she 's got half sense  --  she 's up at the top of this little information pyramid . She 's got access to highlevel strategy  --  and if she 's not a total fool , and if she knows anything about this , it 's a lot more than Tahar got her to come to Kefk . Treaty law , yes . Jik 's got credentials clear from the top , I 'm sure he has . And what he specifically said to her that got her out of Mkks and headed this way  --  gods know . I have an idea the whole urgency behind Ehrran 's search for Tahar has a whole lot to do with the han 's negotiations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think they wanted Tahar dead . Wanted to eliminate any possibility of her advising and helping a hakkikt predict what hani would do . Xenophobia again . But in this case , xenophobia with a real good reason . I 'm guessing Ehrran 's real and immediate motive in going along with this lunatic expedition is because she knew she had n't a spit in a hurricane of getting back to Meetpoint and hani lanes in one piece if she did n't tag close by Jik  --  and learn what he was up to . Meanwhile Akkhtimakt supposedly held Kita , remember . " " Supposedly ? " Haral said . " I think Jik gods-be knew where Goldtooth went when he left Meet/point : straight for deep stsho-tc'a space ; right for a rendezvous with someone who was going to guide the humans in . And then he was supposed to go  --  probably from Tt'a'va'o ( the tc'a connection again ! ) to Kefk  --  harassing Akkhtimakt , making him divide his efforts between holding Kita and trying to keep the Kefk lane open , while Goldtooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a two-way stranglehold on it , trade cut off by the kif at Kita ; and by Goldtooth at Kefk . Goldtooth 's plan was to bring Akkhtimakt down by weakening him  --  lessening his credibility  --  all the while playing another game designed to soften up this whole gods-be zone from Kefk to Meetpoint because he knew humans were going to come through in this vicinity . If he could link up a mahen-human traderoute right past kifish borders , he 'd ruin Akkhtimakt 's credibility once and for all . Devastate him . " Meanwhile the kifish homeworld is in complete chaos with huntersquadsand assassinations , trying to handle Goldtooth and hunt humansand balance its attentions between two rival hakkiktun . And the kif get information what 's going on at Kefk ; and some of that informationgoes to Mkks . to kif , but not to mahen authorities  --  unless the tc'a talked , and they may not have , to unauthorized mahendo'sat . No , Sikkukkut knew exactly where Goldtooth was all the time . But I 'm not sure Jik did , when he accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think Jik even knew for sure whether Goldtooth was alive . So when he was offered a deal that might provide a hakkikt that mahendo'sat could deal with  --  he took it . It 'd take him to Kefk . It would let him link up with Goldtooth , if Goldtooth was still alive . I think mahen information broke down at that one really critical point ; and now Goldtooth 's in danger  --  because I think Sikkukkut sees a lot more of Goldtooth 's thinking than Goldtooth thinks he sees  --  a lot more even than Jik may be aware of . Sikkukkut 's drawn Goldtooth into the open now . Sikkukkut 's got him accessible ; and Goldtooth 's come in , on his own , real close to Sikkukkut . Not playing coy at all . You see ? " " We got trouble , " Haral said . " Gods , we got trouble . " " Oh , it gets worse , cousin . Jik used some kind of credit at Mkks to get that tc'a to go with us . The knnn are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maing Tol  --  that packet that we sent on with Banny Ayhar , if you can believe Goldtooth that far . I do n't know what else Jik did at Mkks , but I 'm betting he gave the tc'a stationmaster our navigation data and got a tc'a to run cover for us and make sure Kefk fell without a shot . The knnn may consent to it . Or the knnn may have taken exception to it . Gods-rotted sure they took the tc'a . We do n't know how they think . Or what they want . But humanity , remember , isp181cutting real close to the knnn 's territory in getting here , if they have n't cut right through it : gods know where the knnn think their zones extend  --  ifthey even understand borders . And Tully says humans have fired at knnn ships . " Eyes dilated all round the bridge . Ears flattened . " So here we are , " Pyanfar said . " We moved into Kefk and caught Kefk by surprise and a high dice roll , and Kefk did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they could spit . Sikkukkut takes everything on the table . " Except for one thing . Akkhtimakt 's got one recourse . The stsho hire mahen guards for top security , right ? The stsho do n't trust hani for anything but the lowest level guard jobs , and they trust kif for bully jobs . But . But . Mahendo'sat are trying to get the humans into the Compact , same way they bullied the stsho into admitting hani once upon a time . Now we have a common border with mahendo'sat that kept us satisfied with trade in that direction for a long time ; and we 've got a natural barrier on the stsho side , with a gulf our ships ca n't jump . Hani have n't been bad neighbors for the stsho . It 's a lot different with humanity . Humanity wants through stsho space . Wants through tc'a and knnn space . Through kif space , if it ca n't get the other routes . That 's got the stsho worried . Real worried . And meanwhile , on Anuurn , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to space and we 've got hani who 're gods-be near as xenophobic as the stsho . Old-fashioned hani who do n't know the stsho . They are n't capable of knowing the stshogods , they are n't capable of imagining the stsho . But stsho money gets to them and buys votes in the han . Sets up new hani authorities of a mindset the stsho approve . That takes care of one border problem . Hire hani guards , then . Displace the mahendo'sat from every security post they hold on stsho property . Get them out . That takes care of the inofficestuff and gets rid of the mahen stranglehold ; and gets mahen fingers out of stsho lines of communication . But there 's one more thing the stsho need to stop the humans , something the nonspacing faction of the han ca n't provide them and no stsho can possibly handle gtstself . Armed ships . In numbers . " " 0 my gods , " Tirun said . " You 've got it , cousin . The humans are headed either for Meetpoint or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stsho to get closer to the mahendo'sat . Make ' em deal with humanity . Bring Akkhtimakt down hard when he ca n't stop the human advance right under kifish noses . But the plan 's backfired , partially thanks to Jik and thanks to us . By taking Kefk , Sikkukkut just piled a pressure on Akkh/timakt that 's forcing Akkhtimakt to do something he 'd never ordinarily do  --  he ca n't handle Sikkukkut and the mahendo'sat and the humans without more help than he 's got . So Akkhtimakt 's headed to Meetpoint to deal with the stsho . Same as the han is . The han 's just ended up on Akkhtimakt 's side . " There was profound silence . Sound whispered from a loose complug ; the ducts hissed . " Well , we got a real problem , do n't we ? " Haral said . " Well , it 's the han ! " Geran said . " It 's the likes of Ehrran , it 's the likes of Naur and all of them back home , the gods-be fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " alone on this side with the mahendo'sat . And the kif . We 're headed for Meetpoint . That 's where the hakkikt will take this party for sure . If he 's sure humanity 's going there and not coming here to take Kefk . That 's the one thing he 's got to be scared of  --  the one thing that could sink him , destroy everything he 's built  --  and Goldtooth might do it to him . He wants to know that . He desperately wants to know that , and Goldtooth is n't talking . If you want other possible motives for Goldtooth coming tamely in to dock  --  try the possibility that he 's got help coming . A lot of it . That has to worry Sikkukkut . He dare n't move til he has some way to cover himself and he dare n't stay here and lose his momentum with his own followers . Goldtooth 's got him worried bad , and Goldtooth wants to keep it that way . " One other thing you can figure : Ehrran . Ehrran 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the least , she 'll run for home  --  straight for the han to try to get a policy decision . And she 'll take them everything in those records . Everything . Our troubles may come to a head at home before we can possibly get there ; if we can get there at all . And there 's no way we can get word to the House and Kohan what 's coming . No way we can warn them  --  unless we break and run for home ourselves . I 'm not about to tell Chur what 's up : she ca n't stand this right now . But the rest of you had better know . You 'd better think about it real hard . We can tear out of here at first excuse and go home . We can lay course straight from Meetpoint , run for all we 're worth the second we hit that system , while everyone else is busy . And we can face whatever we have to back at Anuurn . We ca n't outrun Vigilance . But we might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the han . Organizea fight  --  when , gods help us  --  it may have already been lost out here . " Or we can stay and fight with the mahendo'sat , when it comes , against Akkhtimakt and whatever force the han may have set to assistp183the stsho at Meetpoint . You can guess what captains they might have talked into it . And where that ends then , I do n't know . But I do know this beyond a doubt : if Akkhtimakt should win  --  he 'll own Meetpoint , he 'll move in on the stsho with no one to stop him , once he 's past their security systems ; and gods know what the knnn and the humans and the han will do in their separate craziness . But I do n't decide this one . On this one you tell me . " " What do you think we ought to do ? " Haral asked . " I 've told you . " " Tell us plain . " " Aye , " Tirun muttered . " You 've seen through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? " Pyanfar drew a deep breath , pressed her hands against her eyes . Time went in loops . Anuurn sunset . The old vine on the estate wall . Hilfy playing in the dirt . A ship at Meetpoint , dying because it happened to be hani , and in the wrong placeTully , crouching naked on her deck , writing numbers in his own bloodChur , handing them a white plastic packet , as she lay bleeding on a Kshshti dock  --  A kifish den . Jik 's ridiculous smoke  --  playing sfikgameswith the kif . " I 'd go with the mahendo'sat . Maybe I 'm a fool . Maybe it 's the worst kind of a fool  --  but being a fool has n't stopped Ehrran from dealing left and right , has it ? We ca n't do worse . We ca n't do worse than the ban 's done . Maybe that 's a fool 's arrogance too . Maybe , maybe , and maybe . Maybe it 's Anuurn 's last chance . Last chance for hani to do anything independent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; but that 's the plain truth . I 'm not sure where we 'll end up , or what we 'll do to Chanur back at home , or how they 'll survive this . Or what we 'll be even if we win  --  on Sikkukkut 's side . But I do n't want to see what happens when Akkhtimakt laps up the stsho like an appetizer . That 's what I think . If you think the same , we get our minds on short-term business and we ride the waves the best we can . If it 's go home , you tell me and we go that way long and hard as we can , while we can . " " I 'm on your side , " Haral muttered . " The stsho go down  --  we have n't seen trouble yet . " " Same , " Tirun said ; and : " Same , " said Geran . " No question . " " Same with me , " said Hilfy quietly . " No choice , is there ? " Pyanfar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " I owe you an apology for this , " she said . Understate/ment . But her voice threatened not to work . She bestirred herself to the side and picked up the codepacket from the counter and handed it to Haral , " Mahen codes . We just got made official . As of now , we 're guilty of everything in Vigilance 's files . I just do n't want to spook Vigilance out of our company too fast . So we go on doing what we 've been doing and we do n't give any hints , if by some wild chance Ehrran has n't guessed what Goldtooth 's up to , and what Jik 's done . Gods help us , if we were really lucky , Ehrran would catch some common sense and side with us , and drag the han over to our side , out of the mess it 's in . But that 's about the last hope I entertain . " " She 's snake enough to twist two ways at once , " Tirun said . " Inside out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Meanwhile , " Pyanfar said , " while we 've got some time , we do n't have much , and work goes on . Hilfy , Tully , Khym , they 're sending over some stuff for the kif I 'd like to get rid of him , but I do n't see a way to do it without creating a problem with Sikkukkut , and we do n't need that . On the other hand , whatever he is , he 's stood about what he can . I want him transferred to a regular cabin , I want the room safed , understand . We 're going to have some sort of live stuff to take care of . Skkukukcan do his own vermin-herding . I want it decontaminated . Never mind the docking-check on this watch , except the filters , the ops and the lifesupport ; we 'll catch the little things next . Someone looks in on Chur now and again in Geran 's off watch ; you arrange that , Geran . Do n't wear yourself out . Tirun , call down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . She 's probably chewing sticks down there . I have n't got time to talk to her . Tirun and Geran , Hilfy and Haral when you 've got time , I want this code-strip fed in and checked against the translator . And when you get all that done , I want a regular dinner set up , none of those gods-be sandwiches . " There was dismay in tired faces until the matter of the dinner . " We 'll go off shift , " Pyanfar said , " at need . When there 's a lull , sleep . Feel free to trade off jobs and watches  --  I do n't care who does it , just so it gets done before watch-end , and it gets done with due precautions : no one visits Skkukuk or Tahar alone . Sorry about the schedule . Goldtooth offered a full crew but I turned him down . Trust is fine ; but I 'm not handing over The Pride 's codes to anybody . Not these days . " " Gods-rotted right , " Haral said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a flick of ears and a tautness of jaws . " So get it done , huh ? " She nodded a dismissal . Hilfy got up and walked out with Geran , down the corridor . Tirun turned back to corn and Haral turned to the main board and systems-checks again . Thep185menfolk were last on their way out , separately . And  --  " Khym , " Pyanfarsaid before he could go : " You all right in this ? Tully ? " Khym stopped and stuck his hands in his belt , glanced at the deck with a deference natural in Chanur matters . " You pick the fight , I 'll settle the bastards , was n't it something like that we promised each other fifty years ago ? " It was their marriage vow , less elegantly phrased . But then he looked up , and a curious quirk came and went she had not seen in years . " But I think you 'll have to help , though , wife . " She laughed despite it all and he grinned as if pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders as he walked off the bridge . Somewhere he had got a swagger in his step . The ache in her own bones felt less , for that . " Py-anfar ? " " Tully . " She rose from her chair . Walked over near him as he stood there with confusion on his face . " Tully . Did you follow what I was saying to the crew ? You understood ? " He nodded his head energetically yes , that peculiar gesture meant . " I work , " he said . " I work . " And he turned his shoulder to her , there by the scan panel , his hands busy with some printout which he could no more read than he could breathe vacuum . Avoidance . " Tully , " she said . " Tully . " " I work , " he said . " Put those ridiculous papers down . " She snatched them from his hand and flung them onto the counter . He backed up , hit the chair and caught himself with an arm against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human sweat and Anuurn flowers . And sudden terror . Tirun half-turned her chair , and kept staring in distress . Tully stayed frozen , stsho-pale . Fear . Indeed , fear . It set her heart to poundingand touched off her aggressive reflexes : but child she made herself think , dismissing hunter-mind ; and alien and friend and hair-triggered male . It was not her move that had frightened him . He was beyond that . He knew she would never lay hands on him ; she knew that he knew . It was a deeper thing . " You worried about something , Tully ? " " Not understand lot you say  --  " He waved a vague gesture at the room . At the scan panel . " I work . I do n't need any understand . " " Tully , old friend . " Pyanfar laid a hand on his shoulder and felt the slight shift of muscles as if he had rather not have it resting there ; she smelled his sweat despite that their air was cool for a human . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sputtered through the com Tully wore at his belt . She wore no earplug : she needed none at this range . " You and Goldtooth worked together . He told me . Gods rot you , Tully , you did set me up  --  " The translator rendered something in its flat , Tully-voiced way , and he sank down on the chair arm to evade her hand , out of room to retreat . " You tell me the truth , huh , Tully . What 's got the wind up your back ? Something I said ? " " Not understand . " " Sure . Let 's talk about things . Like things maybe I might like to know  --  What 's the humans ' course ? " " Ta-va  --  " " Tt'a'va'o . You heard that from me just now . Maybe you know more than that . Maybe you know what Goldtooth 's not saying . Truth , Tully , gods blast you ! " He flinched violently . " Truth , " he said . The translator gave him a woman 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his own . " I do n't lie , I do n't lie . " " Where before that ? " " Not sure . Ta-vik . Think Tavik . " " Tvk . At least one kifish port . Tvk . I 'll guess they did n't stop to say hello . Skimmed in and out . And then to Chchchcho , not Akkti , not likely . Chchchcho . The chi homeworld . That 's a real fine route , Tully . Real great . Who planned it ? " " I come  --  Iii . " You mean you do n't know . " " Not know . " " Tully . That packet . Packet . Understand ? What did it say ? " " Make offer trade . " " To whom ? Who to , Tully ? " A desperate wave of the hand . " All . All Compact . " " Kif too , huh ? " " Mahe . Hani . " " Tully , what else was in there ? A knnn message , for instance . Knnn . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was no . The eyes were wide and blue and anxious . " Not . Not know knnn thing . Py-anfar  --  I tell you , I tell you all thing . # # I do n't lie to you . " " Funny thing how that translator always spits on sentences I 'd really like not to doubt . "  | " I 'm friend , I 'm your friend , Py-anfar ! " " Yeah . I know . " " You think I lie . " " Did n't say you lied . Just wish you 'd tell the truth before things get hot , huh ? I just do n't like the feeling there 's something still rattling round back of those pretty blue eyes of yours . Something 's been there since a long while back . " She raked his mane back from his face with a judicious claw  --  let the hand rest on his shoulder again , gently . " Look , Tully  --  you 're not scared of me , are you ? " " No . " " Then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep things from me when we started this voyage ? " " I tell . " " About the ships , yes . You did try . Why not the rest of it ? " " I try  --  try tell  --  You all time # busy not #  --  " " Knnn 's a word would get my attention real fast , Tully . You ever talk about the knnn with Goldtooth , huh ? You tell him about firing on the knnn ? " A blink , a shake of the head , a shift of the eyes . Evasion . " Well , you 've been real helpful to a lot of people , have n't you ? Youtell me the truth about him taking you off that courier ship ? " " Truth . " " He personally ? " " Goldtooth . " " Ever hear anything about another ship ? Another hunter-ship out there  --  someone with the rest of the humans ? " " No . " " You mean these human ships are just careening about Compact space on their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Come on , Tully . How many ? " " I do n't know . " " Two . Ten ? " " Not know . Ten . Maybe ten . Maybe more . " " More . " " I do n't know ! " " Where 'd these ships come from , Tully ? Who 's bringing them ? Who told them to ? You know about that ? " " Not know . " " Goldtooth knew . Truth , Tully . What do you know about these other humans ? " A darting of the eyes aside , elsewhere , back , away again.  | " Huh ? " she asked . " What do you know , Tully ? " " Come fight kif . They come fight kit " " Uhhnnn . " She caught his stare and held it . His eyes darted and jerked and stayed centered , dilated wide in the bright light of the bridge . " How do they sort out which kif , huh , Tully ? Who tells them ? " " Kif is kif . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Take on the whole by the gods kif species ? You 're crazy , Tully . No . The mahendo'sat do n't deal with crazy people . And you 're dealing with the mahendo'sat , are n't you ? " " I ask go to bring you , bring you , Pyanfar , I do n't # the mahendo'sat . " " Say again . " " Mahendo'sat do n't speak all truth . I 'm scared . I do n't know what they do . I think maybe they want help us but I  --  II " He laid a hand on his chest and said it in hani , sending the translator into sputters . " I Tully  --  I scare , Py  --  anfar . " " Of what ? What scares you ? " " I think the mahendo'sat more want help self . Maybe hani have want help self . I do n't know . I do n't understand too much . The translator makes wrong words . I scare  --  I do n't know  --  " " You 're talking real clear now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want any more evasions . You do n't tell me you do n't understand , hear ? You know what kind of mess we 're in . " " I do n't understand . " " Oh , yes , you do . Who 's with the ships , Tully ? What 's the arrangementthey made ? Where are they going next ? " " I do n't understand . " " I told you I do n't want to hear that . I want to know what you know . Tell me this , Tully  --  what questions did Sikkukkut ask you ? What did he ask you , all alone ? " " Not  --  not  --  " His eyes widened . He twisted suddenly and looked behind him . Pyanfar glanced beyond , where Hilfy stood . Reflection and movement in the dead monitor screen . That had caught Tully 's eye ; and he seized on the chance . " Hilfy , " Tully said , pleaded , " Hilfy  --  " " Something wrong ? " Hilfy asked . " We 're just talking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how Chur 's doing , huh ? " " Geran 's with her . Was just there . " Blind to hints . Or ignoring them . " Fine . Go see about the filters . You want to walk through , walk . " Hilfy 's ears went down . She stood there.  | " I go help , " Tully offered , making to get up . " You stay put . " She shoved him back down on the chair arm . " I 'm not through with you . Hilfy . Get . " " What 's the matter ? What 's going on ? " Fear . Human sweat . It was distinct and general in the air . The quiet on the bridge despite two stations working , the look on Tully 's face " We 're discussing routes , " Pyanfar said evenly , quietly , and laid a quiet hand on Tully 's shoulder . He flinched from under it and glanced round in panic . " Discussing what things he may still know . What he might have told without realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular . " " I do n't talk , Hilfy , I do n't . " " Did n't say you were a liar , Tully . I asked you what Sikkukkut asked you . I want to know what Sikkukkut wanted to know . " " For godssakes , aunt  --  " There was sweat on Tully 's face . His skin had gone white . He looked up at her . " Let him alone , gods rot it , aunt , he 's had enough . " " I know he 's had enough . I know what he went through  --  " " You do n't know ! Keep your hands off him ! " Panic . Killing rage . 0 gods . Gods , Hilfy . Whoever wore that look was not a child , had never been a child . " Tully . All right . Get . " She gave him a shove to move him . " Go on , I 'll talk to you later . " " We send out ships , " Tully said , suddenly , perversely clinging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wrist when she made a gesture of dismissal , and he looked from Hilfy to her , to Tirun and Haral and back , his alien eyes flickering and distracted . " It long time  --  long time  --  I try  --  They leave the Earth , understand . They make # self a #  --  " And when she shifted in the pain of his grip , he held the harder . " You listen , listen , Pyanfar , I tell you  --  " " Make sense , gods rot it , the translator 's frying half you say . " " We send ships  --  " He let go her bruised wrist to make a vague and desperate gesture of displacement , of going away . " Ships go from Earth , from homeworld , they make # self # law , make # self # Compact . They do n't like Earth . We fight # long with these human . Now we get no trade # be # to Earth . There be two human Compacts . They # want # . Want Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . We want go  --  out in space  --  not the same direction like before . We find new direction , new trade . We find your Compact , find you . We want trade . This is the truth . If we get trade we make three Compact . Earth # be the third . Earth # be the # friend to hani , to mahendo'sat. "  | " Two human compacts . " Pyanfar blinked and wiped her mane backwith a sore hand and looked at Hilfy , who looked confused . " Three , " Tully said . " Also Earth . My homeworld . We got trouble #two humanities . We want trade . We the home of humanity we need this . We want make way into Compact space , come and go # # # . " " You know about this ? " Pyanfar asked Hilfy . " No , " Hilfy said . " No , I do n't know what he 's talking about . " " # # . Human be three kind . " Tully held up as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth-man . " " Politics , " Pyanfar muttered . " We got gods-be human politics , that 's what . Well , who 's telling the human ships where to go ? " " Earth . Earth tell . " " And what are you , Tully ? " " I spacer . " " You 're so gods-be quick with that . " " Aunt . " " You want to ask him ? " " Gods blast it , take it easy on him ! " Pyanfar drew a deep breath . " Look , maybe he never talked to the kif . I 'll take that on his say-so . Maybe he never spoke a word . But he does n't lie real good . He never did . " " Not to us . " " He speaks the language , niece . Watch the eyes when you ask him questions , never mind the ears , watch the eyes . He 's a lousy liar . He was alone with Sikkukkut . With drugs . With questions . All right , you know what and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he may have spilled something he does n't know he spilled . You think of that ? " " You ever ask me what I gave them ? " Pyanfar blinked in shock . Shook her head at the thought . " A cracked skull and nothing else , " Hilfy said . " I did n't give them anything . And they tried , aunt , that precious kifish friend of yours did try . You take my word , take his . I know he did n't . " " They had him quite a few hours to themselves , Hilfy . With all the pieces to this fractured mess starting to fit in Sikkukkut 's brain , with us in port and leaving Sikkukkut a last few precious hours to try for what he could get out of Tully  --  along with what he learned from other kif living at Mkks . So you want to be some help here and let Tully for godssakes answer for himself ? " " He 's told you . No ! He did n't talk ! I know him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the inside of Hilfy 's ears went suddenly deep rose ; and they folded . Eyes reacted . Everything shoutedp191reaction and shame . It was not what she had meant . Pyanfar felt her own ears go hot ; the flinch was unavoidable , the instantaneous glance aside from the matter they had skirted round and skirted round . She covered it with a cough and a wave with cold deliberation . " Maybe you take my word for something , huh , aunt ? Maybe you trust I got out of there with my wits about me , huh ? And I 'm telling you how he was , and how he handled himself , and I 'm telling you , he 's not a boy and he 's not the fool you take him for . Do n't talk to him like that . " Pyanfar looked at her . Saw no child , no petulance . " I never said he was a fool . I 'm saying you and he may be a little out of your territory , and smart , niece , smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clever as your enemy , you by the gods hope he 's over-confident : you sure as rain falls do n't need to make a mistake in that department . That kif 's not a dockfront tough ; that kif 's smart enough to put the han 's tail in a vise ; and con Jik ; and outwit Akkhtimakt down the line ; and by all the gods near take over the Compact . You want to tell me he could n't just ask you questions and watch your reactions ? You do n't want to remember that time . Fine . You do n't want to think . All right . But that cripples you . And if you 're number two in wit , you do n't need another handicap . We 're in it up to our noses . Remember what I said a while ago  --  what the stakes are right now ? We 've got a problem , Hilfy Chanur . I need a straight answer out of our friend here . I need to know what that gods-be kif 's onto and what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to be here or Meetpoint , which is what Sikkukkut would give a whole lot to learn right now . You think the Compact 's a tangled mess of ambitions ? I 'm betting what drives humanity is the same thing  --  politics we do n't understand . Three Compacts , good gods ! I 'll tell you something else . It 's a good bet Tully does n't know the answers I 'd really want . You think they 'd let him know everything and send him off with the mahendo'sat ? No . That kind of thing gets known by long-toothed old women in high councils . Politics is politics , at least in the oxy-breathing kinds we can talk to . I do n't take anything for granted . I think any thought that needs thinking . Like what deals Goldtooth 's made . Or Jik . Or  --  " She looked at Tully. "  --  what Sikkukkutand you could have talked about in those few hours when he knew by the gods for certain you speak hani . What about it , Tully ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tully 's pupils dilated and contracted and dilated again . He tried to speak and his voice failed him . " He say  --  say he know my friends die , he tell me  --  tell me # # # they # . Say I talk to him , what be humanp192deal with mahendo'sat . What deal with you . Lot time ask . He want know route .

" " I 'm not his friend , Tully . " " I know this kif . " " Know him . " Pyanfar looked from him to a sudden shift of Hilfy 's stance . " Sikkukkut said  --  " Hilfy 's voice was quiet , subdued . " Said he knew Tully from before . " " On Akkukkak 's ship . " Tully nodded . Emphatic . His eyes focussed elsewhere , on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akkukkak # # # . Long time he ask me , my friend question . " " Gods . Akkukkak 's interrogator . Is that what ? Is that where you know him from ? " " He kill my friend , " Tully said . " He kill my friend , Py-anfar . With his hands . " " O good gods . " She sat down against the counter edge , hands on knees . " Tully  --  " " Tully asked me when we got back , " Hilfy said , " just how close you 're friends with Sikkukkut . Now I know why . " " Gods , " Pyanfar said . " I 'm not , Tully . I 'm trying to save our lives , you understand me ? Did you tell him anything , did you give him any-thing ? " Tully shook his head . It was not the naive look , not the clear blue stare he generally had . It was a different Tully . Tully-inside , calm and cold and thinking . She knew it when she saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , do n't look at him . I go far away . I wait . I not be . You say you come to get me . So I wait for you . " Pyanfar let go a long , long breath . The silence stayed there a moment . " Politics , " she said . " All politics . You understand politics , Tully ? Kif are n't anyone 's friends . Not mine . Not anyone 's . But there 's kif and there 's worse kif . You know why I 'm dealing with him ? You understand ? Can you understand ? " " Politics , " Tully said . Not naive , no . " I know you come take me from kif . That be your politics . " " I 'm not any friend of Sikkukkut 's . Believe that . "  | " Bad thing happen . I do n't understand . You lot scare . Where we go ? What we fight ? We got enemy be friend , hani and stssts  --  " " Stsho. " " be enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jik . Do n't trust hani . Do n't trust kif . " " Goldtooth and Jik are friends . We just ca n't trust them much . Not where it crosses mahendo'sat interests . " " Where be hani ? " Pyanfar glanced Hilfy 's way , felt Tirun 's stare at her side . She slouched against the console . " Good question . " " What I do ? " Tully asked . " What I do , Py-anfar ? " " What did you do ? What are you going to do ? I wish I had an answer for either one . Friend , Tully . That 's all I can tell you . Same 's Goldtooth 's my friend ; and yours . Gods know what it counts for . Wish I had an answer for you . Wish you had one for me . " " I fight , " he said . " I crewman on The Pride . You want fight # , hani , kif , I do n't # to die with # . " " Gods rot that translator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it fouled up again ? " " You be my friend . You . Hilfy . All . I die with you . " " Gods , thanks , " Pyanfar murmured bedazedly . A superstitious chill went down her spine . " Translator again . I hope . " Hilfy 's ears had flagged . " I sure hope you come up with a better idea . " Perhaps he did not take the humor . His face stayed void of it . Of everything but anxiety . " Friend , " he said . " You 've got duties . Get . Hilfy . Get . " " Aye , " Hilfy said . And touched the seat-back . " Tully . " He rose from the chair arm . At the other side Tirun had just turned attention to something from the corn-plug in her ear and turned half about again with a flick of the ears and a tilt of the head . Some new difficulty . An incoming call . Pyanfar gave Tully room to get up , laid a hand on his back as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friend . Go help Hilfy , huh ? She wanted you for something . Uhhhnnn . Tully . " He looked back at her , all unprepared and trying to collect it again . " Is there anything you know that we do n't ? " Flicker . " Uhhhn , " she said again , eyes half-lidded . " Py-anfar  --  " " You think of something , huh , you come to me . You come and tell me . All right ? "  |p194The  kif had used shocks with him and got nothing . The mahendo'sat used wit ; and achieved something . She stared him in the eyes without any mercy at all . And tried for a piece of him . 7 " Do n't trust , " he said suddenly , miserably . " Do n't trust humanity , Py-anfar . " And he fled out the door walked out , but it was flight , all the same . Hilfy delayed at his back with one anguished look toward her . And turned and went after him . Pyanfar was unamazed , except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Jik 's . Hers . Humanity 's . Everyone 's but Tully 's  --  who , along with Chanur , had just betrayed his own kind . Gods knew his reasons . What drove him ? Anything hani-like ? Where was family , clan , House ? What was he ? He . Male . Houseless . Sisterless . Wifeless . Renegade . Nau hauruun . But not hani . There was no analogy in Tully to that kind of destructiveorphan , who killed and stalked at random . Nau hauruun . Not Tully their friend . Tully no-name . Tully from distant Earth , of the ships and the strangers . " Captain , " Tirun said quietly . " Captain  --  Ehrran 's on . ' Fraid they 've been on hold a while . They 're getting pretty hot . " " Good , " Pyanfar said flatly ; and went and flung herself into her wellwornchair and powered it about to the boards . Mind on business , Pyanfar Chanur . Wake up . Smell the wind and watch the branches overhead . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harukk on the Tahar business ? " " Not a thing , " Tirun said . " I keep calling ; keep getting the same answer . Sikkukkut 's still not available . Business , they say . " " Gods-be sfik games . I begin to get the feel of it . And I do n't like what 's going on . Put that call through again as soon as I finish with Ehrran . Have them tell Sikkukkut I 'm personally interested in the Tahar crew . Tell him we 've got sfik involved here . " That got a look from Haral , beside her . " Captain . Begging your par-don  --  2 ' Haral left it unfinished . It was hani lives at stake , feud with Tahar or no feud . A miscalculation with the kif might touch something off and get the Tahar crew killed outright . Jik might even be working near to success on the matter . All these things she thought of , and thought of again under that worried glance from Haral , and a like one from Tirun past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A deep frown . " Send it , " Pyanfar said . " Be tactful , that 's all . "  | " Tactful , " Tirun muttered , and turned to execute the first order . Pyanfar turned her chair again and touched the button to bring the long-waiting call through from Rhif Ehrran ; listened to Tirun address the Vigilance com officer . More games of politics and captainly protocols . The corn officer insisted on getting response from The Pride 's captain before putting her own on . " I 'll take it , " Pyanfar said  --  curiously , pride with Ehrran had just diminished in importance . She failed even to feel a twinge of temper with the Ehrran officer who tried to provoke her and put it on record . " This is Pyanfar Chanur . " Keep Ehrran quiet . Get the essentials done . Tahar was the emergency . Chur was safe . Tully assured her nothing critical had spilled into kif hands . There were things Sikkukkut still needed . And that meant at once a safer and a less predictable kif . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , captain . I 'm afraid the captain 's gone of line a moment . " Cold and calculatedly insolent . Games of provocation . Three human compacts ? Fights between them ? One human Compact , Earth , the human homeworld , trying to counter two rival human powers with new trading routes ? Or was it trade they were interested in ? That was a big section of space , if it had room for three starfaring economies ... correction : two . And one that just wanted to be bigger . Did Goldtooth know the situation inside human space ? Mahendo'sat with their scientists and their mad delving into oddities  --  always poking and prodding at things , hoping  --  hoping what ? For new species ? New alliances ? New situations they could use to deal with their old neighbors the kif ? Beware of Goldtooth . Thus the stsho , who had doubledealing down to an art . " Ker Pyanfar , this is Rhif Ehrran . I trust whatever emergency kept you was n't serious . " " No . It 's all handled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . I 'm going to relieve you of one . I 'm sending a detail over to pick up Tahar . " " Afraid not . I 've accepted her appeal for parole . Sorry , Ehrran . She 's under a Chanur roof , so to speak . And I 'm head of house  --  out here . " " This is n't Anuurn and we 're not in the age of sofhyn and spears , you hear me , Chanur ? "  | " No . We play with bigger toys nowadays , do n't we ? You 're fond of quoting the law . Me , I like the old laws right fine : like kinright . The kind of law you ca n't quote by the book , Ehrran . " " Put Tahar on . " Maybe you ought to concentrate on her crew . They 've got a real problem . They might appreciate your intervention . But Dur Tahar 's comfortable enough where she is . Is that all you want ? " Click . " Log that , " Pyanfar said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye , " Tirun said . " Good shot , " Haral said with a dip of her ears . Meaning Rhif Ehrran and a genteel stroll to the brink . " Huh , " Pyanfar said . " Why could n't the kif grab her , huh ? Do us a favor . " " Make a trade ? " Haral suggested brightly . " Gods , that 's a  --  " " Captain . " Tirun lifted a hand , signaling quiet . " Harukk 's going through real procedures this time  --  I think they 're going to try to put the call through . Maybe  --  Yes . The captain 's waiting , Harukk com , if you can do that . Yes . . . . Right . Captain , Harukk corn 's compliments , and they 'll try to reach the hakkikt if you 'll put the request yourself . " Protocols . Sfik games again . Pyanfar flicked her ears and made an affirmative handsign . Immediately the ready light came on and Pyanfar keyed it . Her claws flexed . She drew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to a cold , far place without a future . " Harukk , " she said calmly , " this is Pyanfar Chanur . I have an urgent message for the hakkikt , praise to him . " " Honor to the hakkikt , he may give you his attention , hunter . "  --  So we come up from our obscure beginnings , do we , kif ? Provincial boss and chief torturer  --  to prince ? And we by the gods set you there . She waited . Coldly , calmly . Long . Eventually : " This is Sikkukkut , ker Pyanfar . What is this urgency ? " " Hakkikt . I appreciate the courtesy . And the gift you sent me . I 'd like to talk with you further . I understand you have Moon Rising 's crew in your custody . . . . " " Hunter Pyanfar , your forwardness would daunt a chi . Is my gift too scant for your appreciation ? " " Hakkikt , I see a way to use it to your benefit and mine . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a courier I can be more specific . " Pause . " Hunter Pyanfar , you interest me . But I see no reason why onep197of my skkukun should come from my ship to yours and back again , when your own look to be in good health . And I have nothing to say to your crew . I made you a proposition at Meetpoint , you may recall , which you declined . I make it again  --  a rare offer . Come to my deck this time . If this offer has the merit you say . I trust it does . I 'll expect you  --  within the hour . " ClickShe leaned back in the chair . " Captain , " Haral said , beside her , " good gods  --  " She turned a look in Haral 's direction . " That did n't go right . " " Now what ? We call Jik ? " " Call Jik to mop up ?  --  We just got a challenge , cousin . I got it . Sfik The bet just got taken and doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , good gods , they ca n't get Goldtooth in reach  --  they want you ! You just heard Tully say what that son is and you said yourself what Sikkukkut wants most-Goldtooth was just here , talking to you . The kif have to know that . They know he could have passed us what they want to know  --  " " They 'll kill the prisoners . They 'll kill them sure now if I fail that appointment , and they 'll let us know about it . If that were n't enough , our credit with the kif hits bottom . Hard . " " You ca n't do it ! " " I ca n't duck it either . No . Sure that earless bastard is going to try us . One way or the other . And I think I 'm starting to think in kifish ; I think I read him . I 'm perfectly safe to walk in there  --  if I can keep him wondering . I 'm going to need company out there . Want to take a walk ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despairing shrug . " Gods , why not ? "  |p198The  air of Kefk hit like an ammonia-tainted wall . Haral coughed even on the ramp ; Pyanfar sneezed and felt the sting of her eyes in spite of the antiallergents . Haral had put on her portside finery , dark spacer blue with a collection of gold earrings , a set of bracelets , an anklet with a bangle , a belt with silver and gold chains that rattled right along with a monstrous black AP gun and a belt-knife . Pyanfar wore the red silk trousers , gold bracelets and belt and gold-earrings aplenty ; a knife and a pocket-gun besides the AP slung low on her hip . " We look a right set of pirates , " Haral had said before the lock sealed them out . " It 's the pirates outside worry me , " Tirun had retorted to them both , there in the lock . And Khym had said other things , while Geran and Hilfy fretted and gnawed their mustaches sparse  --  " Huh , " Geran had said , with exhaustionand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  " Haral : " My job . " And Tully , later : " Where she go  --  where go , Py-anfar ? " She avoided answers with Tully . " Out , " she had told him in that unwanted encounter in the downside corridor . " I got business , Tully . I 'm in a hurry . " " Careful , " he had said , anxious-looking . Frightened , doubtless from the time he heard that inner lock open , preparing to expose The Pride to the kifish docks . She reckoned the crew would tell him where they hadp199gone after she was well on her way . Or better yet , when she and Haral got back . When , They walked the dockside , she and Haral , in a sodium-light hell of clinging smokes and ammonia-reek and a moist chill like a swamp at sundown . Kif moved , black wisps in the dimmer shadow along the far wall of this section of warehouses and factory fronts . There was no color anywhere about Kefk docks but the sickly sodium-glow , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round steel doorway . " Kkkkt . Kkkkt , " the sound came to them , as they walked past kifish ships . Kif , doubtless some of their erstwhile companions  --  had seen them walk outside and gathered in clusters to whisper  --  and perhaps , Pyanfar thought , to wonder whether the two hani walking down the docks of Kefk had lost their collective minds . ( " Look at you , " Khym had cried in dismay while she dressed for this foray . " Wear that into a den of thieves ? Py , for godssakes ! " ) Crazy to wear that much gold into a kifish den if one had not the sfikI to hold onto it . " So we look like trouble , " Pyanfar had said to Haral when they laid their plan . " A lot of trouble , by kifish lights . That 's the idea . " Advertise their presence and hold it under kifish noses till they smelled it and looked at the gold and the weapons and remembered that The Pride 's crew had no general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kind . Dangerous . They were also the hakkikt 's invited guests . At least on the way to the meeting . " Marvelous thing about kif , " Pyanfar muttered in a moment when she and Haral were well out of earshot of kif , between one gloomy shipberthand another . " It occurs to me that these types out here on the dock are n't any more secure than we are . We 're high on the wave and so are they and kif sail a rotted choppy sea . Always wondering when the wind 's going to shift . " " They 're different , that 's a fact , " Haral muttered in her turn . " No lasting grudges  --  and , gods be feathered , nothing they wo n't trade . Flighty folk . I do n't think hani ever have got the right of them . Maybe we should have brought our friend Skkukuk on this trip , huh ? " " I did think about it . But I 've got an uneasy feeling that one 's a little crazy even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives . " " Huh . Me either , now I think on it . " A waft of something reached them down the dock . Blood . Evenp200through the ammonia . Pyanfar hissed and cleared her throat . " Good gods , " Haral swore in disgust . " That 's enough to kill your appetite . " " We 're nearly  --  "  --  there , Pyanfar started to say and suddenly lost the thread of her thought as she caught sight of the kifish numerals for 28 : Harukk 's berth . Kif traffic was thick hereabouts and the blood-smell grew stronger . It worsened rapidly , the closer they walked . The steel rampway rail had a series of metal poles chained to its stanchions , and a dark object sat atop each . " Gods and thunders , " Pyanfar muttered , " Haral , do n't flinch . " The heads were kif . Kif came and went on that number 28 ramp , pastthe awful watchers ; she and Haral headed that way among the rest , waiting for challenge from some guard or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and Pyanfar gave the gory object atop it a cold and curious glance . " So much for the opposition , " Haral said . " Sure ought to keep the new converts in line , " Pyanfar muttered . Every kif that came into Harukk had to see it , victory for some , grim warning for the others . At least , she thought in profoundest relief , none of the heads was hani . Kif turned and stared at them as they passed , upward-bound like all the rest who had business aboard Harukk . A knot of kif who stood at the accessway clicked and hissed as they passed but made no offer to delay them . There were , finally , guards inside the large airlock . " Hakktan , " one said in kifish . Captain ? " Ukt , " Haral answered with a nod at Pyanfar . Yes . Pyanfar stood by with her arms folded , arrogant to the slant of her ears , and let Haral do the talking . Two of the three kif kept their hands tucked within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore openly . They stood blocking other traffic into the lock from either direction , while the third reported their presence to the monitor above . The answer came , orders for their admittance . The guard at the inner hatch stepped aside ; and the third guard bowed with that hands-empty gesture : " Inside , " that one said . " Huh , " said Pyanfar ; bowed and slanted her ears back when she did it . Haral stayed close as they passed the hatch to Harukk 's ammoniasmellinginterior . More kif waited in the inside corridor  --  one who turned out to bep201merely delayed traffic , who stalked on ; and four tall kif rattling with weapons . " Follow , " one said , and stalked off in the lead without looking back . Three walked behind , while two stayed . And not a word of objection about the array of weapons their visitors brought aboard . Not a word of any kind . They passed kif in these dim corridors that stank of ammonia and machinery and blood and other , unidentifiable things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , Pyanfar thought . Do n't notice the hakkikt 's odd guests , do n't stare , do n't give offense . The aura of fear and fierceness throughout the place was infectious . It bristled the back , set the pulse beating faster , sent fight-flight impulses coursing the nerves . Hilfy knows this place , Pyanfar thought at sight after sight , with an involuntary tightening of her gut . Hilfy was in this awful place . Hilfy had stood silent by Khym 's side when she had broken the news to them where she and Haral proposed to go . Khym had had his opinion of it all . Like Geran . But Hilfy 's ears just went flat and her nostrils drew taut ; and : " Huh , " Hilfy had said . " Why ? " With a darkness of memory in her eyes ; and an estimation , and nothing else readable . " You know it 's a trap . " " I know , " Pyanfar had said . " At this point there is n't a better choice . " Hilfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her no argument . No offer to come either . The situation wanted cold steadiness and as little as possible chance of provoking the kif . And that put the job , by seniority and by disposition , on Haral Araun . Haral walked along beside her now as warily easy as on a trek down one of the Compact 's rougher docksides  --  kept her ears up and her face serene during the ride pent in a lift with the pair of kifish guards . The lift stopped ; one guard exited and the rest hung back as they had done below . And it was one more long walk down the dimly lit corridor aft from the lift ; then an open doorway , and a dim chamber where a handful of kif waited attendance on one seated on an insect-legged chair , a kif who wore a silver medallion , whose black robe and hood were edged in silver that shone dimly in sodium-light . " Hakkikt , " Pyanfar said , approaching this grim magnificence . And bowed with a carefully rationed measure of respect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark-gray hand . " Ksithikki . " Kif scurried to the corners of the room and carried back two chairs and a low table , all at a virtual run . " Ksithti. "  |p202Pyanfar  nodded and sat down in one , feet tucked . Haral took the other . More orders from Sikkukkut , and a wave of his hand in a silverborderedsleeve . Kif scurried after pitcher and cups with as great haste ; and hurried to put a cup into Sikkukkut 's outstretched hand before it had had time to tire of waiting . A cup went to Pyanfar ; a third to Haral . A kif had poured for Sikkukkut ; and came quickly to pour for them from the same pitcher . It was , thank the gods , parini . Liquor . Strong and straight and likely to go straight to the head ; but it was nothing objectionable . Pyanfar sipped gingerly and tried not to think of obvious things like whether the off-taste was the ammonia in her nostrils or something in the drink . But they were sitting in Sikkukkut 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in kif space ; and drugged drinks here seemed as superfluous as removing their weapons , which no one had offered yet to do . Haral followed her lead and drank : Haral , whose stomach was redoubtable in station bars from Anuurn to Meetpoint and who always made her duty schedules without a hangover . For the second time she was glad it was Haral by her and not Khym . " You turned down this invitation once at Meetpoint , " Sikkukkut said . " I remember . " A sneeze threatened her dignity . And their lives . She fought it back with an effort that made her eyes water . It was psychological , this aversion to kif . She had taken the pills . And gods , those pills made a hazardous combination with the liquor , dried her mouth , dulled her perceptions . And her nose still prickled . " I told you then I looked for a change of mind someday . " Sikkukkut dipped his nose into the ornate cup and drank . " And here it is . Kkkt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency , do you mind ? " Wits , get your mind working , Pyanfar Chanur . " There was a medical difficulty ; but the emergency call to the mahendo'sat was a matter of convenience . " She looked straight at the hakkikt and prayed the gods greater and lesser for no sudden sneezes . Attack the matter straight on . Rob the bastard of all his carefully laid traps and surprises . " Actually it was an excuse for consultation with two of my allies  --  without the nuisanceof a third , speaking plainly . On several matters . Your gift , hakkikt  - -  gives me options to deal with that nuisance . That 's why I came . It may rid you of one too  --  since I think my annoyance and yours has one source . " " Kkkkt . " Another sip , and a shadowed glance within the shadowing ,  |p203silver-edged  hood , black eyes reflecting the glare of sodium-light . " I take it then you do n't intend to kill this Tahar hani . " " No . I do n't . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain . This would be a rather large gift on my part . They are unusual  --  kkt . Ikkthokktin . A mild rarity . Amusing . I do n't say I 'm personally interested , but certain of my skkukun would be pleased to have one or another of them . Is it perhaps a certain  --  ethical reluctance  --  on your part ? Should your desires mass more than others of my captains ? " Think " I have reasons more than amusement . " Kifish logic . Pukkukkta . Let him lead himself astray . When outclassed in wit , create plausible complications and let the enemy think himself to death . " You have to understand , hakkikt , I 'm sure you do  --  that Rhif Ehrran is no particular friend of mine . I do n't doubt you 've heard from her , wanting them released to her . " " And from Keia and even from Ismehanan-min . These Tahar hani seem to be a matter of some excitement in your faction . A sfik-item , you say . But why should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests quite a few people , particularly hani . They 're a big family , they 've got wide holdings in the same continent as Chanur , as well as being spacer-hani , which also makes them valuable in some quarters . No . I 'm going to ask an even larger favor of you , hakkikttrustingMoon Rising got through the station takeover undamaged . I want that crew handed over to me -- and I want their ship . " " Kkkt . Pyanfar Chanur , your audacity grows larger by the hour . First Tahar , then the crew , now the ship . Next will you ask me for Kefk ? Akkht , perhaps ? " There was a hush in the room . Not a kif stirred . " You have Kefk . " Pyanfar assumed her most charming smile . " Myself , hakkikt , my ambitionsare different . I want this one small ship . And its crew . For my own reasons . " " Where are the mahendo'sat ? Where is Keia ? He could surely make hani reasonable to me . Kkkt . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And  --  kkt  --  the emergency call and the consultation . Kkkt . Kkkt . Who is injured ? " " One of my crew . A minor business . It gave me the chance to talk with Goldtooth . Ismehanan-min . It has to do with the ship . " ( Back to the trail , hakkikt ! ) " Goldtooth delivered me some information that makes me surer than ever where my interests lie . Rhif Ehrran and I are about to come to severe difference ; it 's possible she 'll attack us directly , but doubt it  --  she wants to survive . She has the means to create **36;14046;TOOLONG face , while behind the scenes his own preparations went ahead frantically . For now that the Germans and Russians were facing each other across a common border , there could no longer be any doubt what the Germans were preparing for , just as soon as Hitler extricated himself from his Western entanglement . But now , in this world , it was still July . The sudden show of solidarity with the Russians might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna Kharkiovitch thought as she gazed at the gray , foam-flecked waters of the Bay of Biscay . But this would be the last opportunity to save the situation in Europe . Everything depended on its being seized and exploited vigorously . Beside her , Gordon Selby closed the magazine that he had been thumbing idly . They had flown from Miami to Lisbon on Pan Am 's newly inaugurated transatlantic Clipper passenger service , and stayed overnight at the Hotel Duas Nocas to await a connection to Poole , in Dorsetshire , on an Imperial Airways flying-boatfrom South Africa . " You know , I think I 've come to terms with it , " Selby said , turning his head and leaning across to speak closer to her ear . After twelve hours in the air the day before , they had learned to be almost oblivious to the constant roar of four sixteen-cylinder aero-engines . " If we do end up being stranded back here , we might be better off in the long run . " Anna nodded as if she had been expecting something like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would happen . " Selby looked surprised . " How did you know ? " " I 've been wondering , too . " " Well , what do you think ? " Anna studied his face . " Out of curiosity , what difference would it make to you ? " she asked . " Do you have any ties that would make you want to go back ? " Selby shook his head . " None , really . " " No family or anything ? " " My parents were in the Congo when it was overrun and did n't get out fast enough  --  my father was a mining engineer there . Nobody ever found out what happened to them . " " How old were you then ? " ' About twelve . I was back in the States when it happened , on school vacation . I finished growing up in an orphans ' home and never got close to anybody . I wanted to be an engineer , though . It seemed . . . well , like a way of respecting my dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I ended up in nuclear engineeringbecause of a subconscious desire to make bombs to throw hack at them before it was all over . "  |p151Anna  smiled . " You think so ? " " I do n't know , but I cheered as loud as anybody when Kennedystood up and said we were through with being pushed around . " " You see , it 's the same with all of us , " Anna said . " Nobody on the team has any compelling reason for wanting to go back , and everyone has a score to settle with Hitlerism . It 's as if Claud picked us with that in mind . " Selby pursed his lips behind his black , pointed beard . " So , are you saying that Claud knew the gate was n't going to work ? " he asked . " I do n't know . Let 's just say that I do n't think he was taken completely by surprise . I believe he was hoping for the best , but he was prepared for the worst when it happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did he pick the particular mix of people we 've got , for example ? Some good techniciansand a couple of engineers would have been enough to assemble the gate . Were a historian and a diplomat necessary ? " " Exactly . And were all the military people necessary for security ? " Anna asked . " Even if they were , why do they all just happen to be experienced in overseas undercover work , especially in Germany ? " The Sunderland droned on , and parts of the French coast came into view in the haze on the horizon ahead . After a minute or two of silence , Anna asked , " Does Claud want the gate to work , do you think ? Or is this business about Einstein just a ploy to keep up morale until we 've all adjusted to the idea of not going back ? " " You mean did he knowingly abandon a lost cause in our world for the chance of a different outcome here ? " " Yes  --  just that . " Selby thought for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . Sure , he was prepared for what 's happened , but he 'll do everything possible to get the connection working if he can . Claud can be objective and calculating when the job demands it , but he 's human underneath . He would n't just leave our world to its fate , with complete disregard for the people in it who were relying on us . " " What makes you think that ? " " The fact that I 'm here , on this plane . " " So ? " " My field is nuclear weapons , which is no doubt the reason I 'm on the mission . If Claud 's only interest were defeating Hitler in order to build a nice , comfortable world to live in , the most important thing would he to get an American A-bomb programp152moving , okay ? Well , if that was what he wanted , I 'd be back there helping to start it . " Selby spread his hands briefly . " But Claud did n't do that . Instead he sent me over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way for a while and make sure that the scientists back there are n't distracted from the thing he wants them to concentrate on , which can only be the gate . That says to me that he 's serious about Einstein . I 'm just the insurance in case it does n't work and we end up having to make our own bomb . " Anna nodded and seemed relieved . " Yes , " she agreed . " That was how I saw it , too . I was hoping so much that you 'd say that . " They lapsed into silence for a while . Then Selby looked up from his magazine again and said , " What about Cassidy , though ? He 's got a reason for wanting to go back . " Anna turned her head . " Because of that girl he talks about ? Oh , you ca n't take that too seriously . You know what Cassidy 's like . " " You do n't think he is engaged , then ? " " Quite possibly he is , or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think it would be so much of a tragedy if they did n't go through with it ? " Selby rubbed his nose with a knuckle and grinned faintly . " I guess not . But then the whole thing was bizarre from the beginning . I mean , Cassidy 's okay in his own way , but he can be a bum . How did he ever get mixed up with a family like hers anyway ? " " Bum ? " Selby tossed his hands up in a candid gesture . " Well he is , is n't he ? Let 's be honest . " Anna looked at him curiously for a few seconds . " You do n't really know Cassidy , do you , Gordon ? " " Why , what 's there to know ? " " He comes from one of the wealthiest families in the southwest  --  thedirect heir to an oil and minerals fortune . But he despisedthe people around him for living lives of luxurious banality at a time when the country had its back to the wall , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army . As you said , Claud would never have picked the kind of jerk that Cassidy sometimes pretends to be . " Selby stared at her in astonishment . " How do you know about it ? " he asked . " Harry told me the story after we arrived in New Mexico  --  we were driving into Albuquerque in one of the trucks for something or other . I 'd been a bit hard on Cassidy over something , and Harry wanted to straighten the situation out . Those two work well together . "  |p153That  would have been typical , Selby thought . Harry was n't the team 's greatest talker , but for some reason it seemed natural for him to have confided something like this to Anna . " Hmm , strange , " he remarked . " You seem to have a knack for getting along with the troops . " " It 's not really strange , " Anna told him . " When I was younger , I fought with the Siberian partisans for five years before I got out . I 'd killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was eighteen , an SS colonel ordered all the men in my family 's village to be shot . I went to bed with him so that I could cut his throat while he was asleep . You see , Gordon , Special Operations soldiersand I speak the same language . " Back at Gatehouse , Professor George Pegram , head of the Physics Department and Dean of the Graduate Schools at Columbia , had collapsed weakly into one of the chairs in the mess area , stunned from the things he had learned in the last sixty minutes . Winslade , Greene , Scholder , and others from the Proteusteam , along with the three Hungarian physicists , were standing and sitting in various positions nearby . Pegram had been out of town , and over a week had gone by since Szilard 's first frantic phone calls from Gatehouse to Teller and Wigner . " Before you recover your wits , George , yes , we know there are seemingly impossible logical contradictions , " Szilard said . " But trying to grapple with them at this stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've tried . We all have . So has Lindemann over in England . It needs a different kind of approach , a mind with a knack for questioning the obvious and for seeing the problem from the angle that everyone else misses . That 's why we want Einstein . " " More than just Einstein , " Winslade said from where he was standing in the middle of the floor . " According to our original plan , the President and certain members of the government should already have become involved . I do n't see any reason why a technical hitch should justify delaying that any further , especiallysince we may find we need access to all kinds of resourcesthat a word from the White House could unlock . " " In short , we approach the President through Einstein , " Teller said to Pegram . Pegram blinked dazedly , shook his head , and at last found his voice . " Yes , I can see what you 're saying . But why not go to Rooseveltdirect in the first place ? " " Think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tuve were thrown out as cranks when they tried a direct ap/proach to the government , just to get backing for fission research . Do you really want to be the one to go back and tell them we 're into time machines now ? " Pegram nodded glumly . Wigner was right . Szilard had received a letter only a few days earlier , politely but firmly turning down their second attempt at interesting the Navy . " Einstein 's prestige would carry the right weight , " Pegram agreed . " But how is he going to get the message to Roosevelt ? I mean , with all due respect to him , could we rely on him to carry out a job like that ? You 've heard the stories .... " " I have negotiated suitable arrangements already , " Szilard said , sounding just a little officious . " Gustav Stolper , the Austrianeconomist , recently introduced me to somebody called AlexanderSachs , who 's an economics consultant to the Lehman Corporation and also a personal friend of the President 's . I 've talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Roosevelt personally , signed by Einstein . " Pegram looked aghast . " You 've talked to him already ? For God 's sake , Leo , we ca n't allow information of this kind to  --  " " Oh , of course , I did n't tell him anything about Proteus or the machine here , " Szilard said impatiently . " We 're using uraniumresearch and the possibility of a fission bomb as a cover story . The real subject will be divulged later , only to Roosevelt in person . " Pegram looked at Winslade . " You 're happy about this , Claud ? " " Oh , yes . Leo was kind enough to clear it with us before he said anything to Sachs , " Winslade replied . There was nothing more to be said . Pegram looked around one more time and then nodded . " Very well , let 's go and talk to Einstein . Can you arrange a meeting in Princeton , Leo ? " " He 's not there , " Szilard replied . " The last I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gone off to sail his boat . So , first we 'll have to find him . " And so it came about that on Sunday , July 30 , 1939 , while Teller and Pegram were at Gatehouse with Greene studying the construction of the machine , Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner found themselves driving with Winslade and Scholder in Wigner 's car , looking for a summer house belonging to a Dr. Moore , somewhere in the vicinity of Peconic , Long Island.  |p155IT  WAS PAST 3:00 A.M. , and Stan Shaw , " your very good friend , the Milkman , " was babbling a cheerful news bulletin between commercialson WNEW 's all-night radio program . Ferracini was dozing , chin on his chest and chair tilted back to rest his feet on the large table in the center of the mess area . Cassidy was sprawled in an armchair behind a newspaper , and Floyd Lamson was sitting on the floor with his back to the wall by the coffeepot , whittlingan owl from a piece of wood to add to the collection of animal forms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team at Gatehouse were either asleep or with Einstein and the other visitors , who were still examining the machine . Ferracini was picturing again the house that he had lived in as a boy , a yellow-painted wooden house with a brown shingled roof , near the gas station that one of his Uncle Frank 's brothers owned . He remembered Frank , lean and muscular , coming home from the construction jobs he worked on across the river in Manhattanand talking over dinner about ball games and plans for fishing trips . When the news in the papers was bad , he talked about the things the Nazis were doing in Asia and Africa . Aunt Teresa would become very quiet when Frank talked about things like that . In the evening , Frank and Harry would sometimes listen to ap156fight on the radio , with Frank blocking and jabbing to the commentaryas he followed the action blow by blow . Some nights he would shower , change , and pack his kit to go to one of the clubs where he boxed himself , or watched a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to sit down with Harry by the firesideand tell stories about the old days in Italy before Mussolini and the Fascists . Life then sounded so simple and carefree , with lots of singing , dancing , and weddings in the village church . The world had seemed to be just a small community of relatives , friends , and familiar faces such as Father Buivento , Luigi the Mayor , Dino the wagonmaker , Rodolfo the dairyman , and more whom Ferracini could still picture from his childhood imaginings . His fantasies had mirrored the security and contentment of the age at which he had created them ; sometimes , in harsher moments of later years  --  waiting inside a troop carrier to parachute out into the Greenland night during arctic training , maybe , or lying motionlessfor hours on an Alpine ridge while search parties with dogs combed the slopes below  --  he had thought back wistfully to that make-believe world of warmth and caring , where everybody knew everybody and all had a place to belong . Now , strangely , he felt he had found something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The remoteness from their own times was forging a bond among the members of the team that made them seem like a family in many ways ; and the circle of regulars at Max 's , the Indian restaurant upstairs , Mooney 's bar along the block , the pool parlor across the street , and other places that Ferracini was getting to know had a friendly familiarity that was a new experience to him . Back in January , he remembered , he had felt contempt for the America that he had found existing before the holocaust years of the forties ; but something in his perceptions had changed since then . Although Roosevelt 's New Deal had included its share of failures and miscalculations , it had nevertheless succeeded in inspiringthe nation with the determination it needed to help itself . And the nation , responding with rugged optimism , had pulled itself through the economic blizzard of the thirties , its basic human values of compassion and respect for individual freedom still intact . It had avoided succumbing to the forces of tyranny , hatred , mob-rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across Europe . Ferracini was beginning to think that there was something to be proud of and a lot that was worth preserving in a people who could do that . " Says here that with good behavior , and providing he pays the twenty grand he owes , Alphonse Capone 'll be eligible for re/lease from jail in November , " Cassidy announced over the paper that he was reading . " Where 's he at ? " Lamson asked from his position on the floor . " Some place called Terminal Island off San Pedro , Califor-nia . " " Well , I hope he behaves himself and stays in line this time , " Lamson drawled . " Otherwise , we might have to teach him some manners , too , like Bruno . " He set down his knife and turned the wooden owl in his hands to inspect it . " What kind of rap did they get him on in the end ? " he asked . " Forgot to mail his taxes , " Cassidy said . Lamson shook his head reprovingly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess that 's what happens . " At that moment , the door leading to the machine area opened softly , and Einstein appeared . Cassidy put down his paper . Ferracini took his feet off the table and sat up . Lamson set aside his owl and rose awkwardly to his feet . Einstein held up a hand and seemed apologetic for the intrusion . " Please , any need to disturb yourselves , there is not , " he said in his quaint , heavily accented English as he came in and shuffledacross to the table . " I am looking to get the cup of tea , if possible . Back there , politics they are all talking  --  such a dreary subject , even for one who understands , which I do not pretend to . So I ask where the bathroom is , and I sneak away . " He winked conspiratorially at Ferracini and whispered behind a raised hand , " I can always tell them I get lost trying to find the way back . It 's amazing what you can get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although he had , by this time , acquired a snowy halo of wispy hair , Einstein was noticeably younger than the image depictedin the better known photographs of later years . He had a high forehead , dimpled cheeks , and a stubborn chin . His eyelids drooped downward at the sides , and in combination with his raggedmustache , would have given his face something of the look of a sad walrus , were it not for his bright eyes and the mischievous half-smile playing around his mouth . He was wearing a frayed brown sweater and shapeless pants , and had arrived with Szilard and Wigner early in the evening . The others eyed each other uncertainly for a few awkward seconds . " Tea , " Lamson mumbled . " We got some hot water here . Do n't know about any tea , though .... " " In the cupboard underneath , " Cassidy prompted . " Where the sugar and cream are , " Ferracini said needlessly . " Oh , yeah . . . lemme take a look . "  |p158Einstein  pulled up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time stretching the neck of his sweater to take his pipe from a shirt pocket . " You know , this year I have my sixtieth birthday . In all this time , never do I learn to drive the automobile , and only just have I mastered the intricacies of a camera  --  too much fiddling and twiddling and fussing , you understand . " He gestured over his shoulder with the stem of his pipe . And now this machine of yours you spring on me  --  an old man , set in his ways and his thoughts , who was foolish enough to believe he had caught a glimpse of how God was thinking when He designed the universe . Always I am telling myself that when we see complicationsin Nature , then what we are looking at is not yet the truth . Underneath , truth is always the simplest . But now this ! How am I to reconcile the things I am hearing now with the faith I refuse to abandon that Nature reasonable and orderly is , and unreasonablymalicious is not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Cassidy made an extended performance of folding his paper . Loyalty in combat situations and so forth was all very fine , but this was something else : Harry was on his own . Ferracini swallowed and made a conscious effort to look smarter than he felt just at that moment . " That sounds kind of strange , sir  --  Professor , " he stammered . " ' Dr. Einstein ' is good , " Einstein said . " So what is so strange , Captain , yes ? Or is it the first name that you prefer , being Amer-ican ? " " Harry 's fine  --  everyone else uses it here , anyhow . . . . Oh , you being confused by something complicated , I guess . Most peoplethink of you as being about as complicated as a guy can get . " " Is not true , Harry . " Einstein looked around him invitingly . And ? ... " " Er . . . oh , I 'm Cassidy . " " Floyd . " " Harry , Cassidy , and Floyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap for the shaving and for the face-washing . Most people , they use two soaps . But , I ask , why there is need to use two soaps ? Those are the things that make life too fiddling and twiddling , like cameras  --  more things to do that are n't important , and more things to remember that do n't matter . So always I use just one soap . " Ferracini was perplexed . Here was probably the greatest physicist of the century , he 'd been told  --  supposedly , one of the greatest minds of all time , who had just been confronted by peoplefrom the future and the reality of time-travel  --  looking like ap159benign , Chaplinesque grandfather and rambling on genially about cameras and shaving soap . Ferracini did n't know what he was supposed to say . Army training had n't covered situations like this . The other two seemed to be having the same problem . " So you are with the Army , " Einstein said , pulling tobacco from a worn pouch that he had produced from somewhere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floyd , you are sergeants , I was told earlier  --  yes ? " " That 's right , " Cassidy said . Einstein nodded . " In Switzerland , when I was a young man , they turn me down for military service , because I have flat feet and varicose veins , they say . But then , perhaps , it was more seriousin the world that you are from . The whole country has become a military camp , to me it sounds . " That was a tricky subject . Einstein had refused vehemently to have anything to do with German militarism at the time of the Great War , and the soldiers were unsure how to respond withoutrisking offense . Cassidy said cautiously , " It had gone past politicsor economics . The only choice we had left was to surrender what we believed in , or else to defend it with everything we had . If you 'd seen the things that were happening all over the rest of the world ... " " But I have seen the things which for years now are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment there was a hint of sharpness in his voice . He nodded in acknowledgmentas Lamson placed an enamel mug of steaming tea in front of him , then relaxed with a smile and a sigh . " Your worrying is not necessary , Cassidy . People , they do not understand .... " " Wir konnen uns auch auf Deutsch unterhalten , wenn es Ihnen lieber ist , " Lamson interjected as he sat down . ( We can continue the conversation in German , if you prefer . ) Einstein 's eyebrows shot upward in surprise . " Das babe ich wirklich nicht erwartet , dass ihr alle Deutsch sprecht ! " ( I really did n't expect this  --  that you all speak German ! ) " We 've all worked overseas in Nazi Europe , " Ferracini said , switching to German also . " You had to speak German to get picked for those kinds of operations . " " So where did you learn it ? " Einstein asked , looking around the table . Army school , most of us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . It had to be  --  your life was at stake , usually for months at a time . " Einstein nodded . " Yes , I suppose so . . . . But , anyway , where were we ? Ah , yes  --  people do n't understand . Because I refused top160contribute to the war effort in 1914 , they think I 'm one of these pacifists who want us to pay any price for peace , as if ' peace ' could be anything but an illusion under those terms . " " You 're not ? " Lamson , who had decided that Einstein was human after all , sounded mildly surprised . " Not if it leads to the kind of world that you three are from . " Einstein held a match to his pipe and puffed several times . " Certainly , I deplore aggression and violence as a way of solving problems . They can only lead to worse grievances and problems in the long run . But being prepared to defend yourself if you have to is not the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization . When the body is infected , it mobilizes its antibodies and destroys that which is alien to it . So , too , must the planetary organism . In other words , I accept , regretfully , that there are some evils that can only be stopped by force . Appealing to their better nature is as futile as attempting to reason with a virus . " Einstein shrugged . " So , when , in Belgium , they asked me if young men should go to do military service , I answered that they should not only go , but go cheerfully , because they would be helping to save European civilization . But the pacifists , who had misunderstood my position all along and tried to adopt me as a patron saint , howled in fury and denounced me as a traitor . " " Maybe they were accusing you more of being inconsistent , " Lamson suggested . Ferracini was surprised . For Lamson to expressan opinion about anything in more than a grunt or a monosyllablewas unusual . Einstein seemed to be having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Really , there is no inconsistency . I am opposed to the cult of militarism and the suppression of freedomby force of any kind . Twenty-five years ago , resisting war served that goal . With the situation that exists today , however , the only hope that the free nations have for survival is the strength of their armed forces . So , the means that are different superficially , at a deeper level serve the same end . " He thought for a moment , and his eyes twinkled . " Or , as I suppose you might say , ' Everything is relative . " Ferracini grinned faintly and caught Cassidy 's eye . Cassidy nodded back in a way that said , this guy is okay . Lamson shifted his weight in his chair and frowned , then looked up at Einstein . " So , do you think it 's possible to avoid it  --  the kind of future we 're from ? " he asked . " Even if we do avoid the mistakes that led to that mess , who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? There are plenty of mistakes around , just waiting to be made . "  |p161Einstein  shrugged . " Maybe , maybe not . . . I 'm no longer young enough to know everything . I suppose I still have faith in people , despite it all , " he said . " The older you get , the less you know ? " Cassidy queried , raising an eyebrow . " Oh , but it 's very true , " Einstein assured him . " Except for scientists , of course . They never know anything at all . " The other three exchanged puzzled looks . " It 's true , " Einstein told them . He sipped his tea and puffed a cloud of smoke from his pipe . " Most of the world still does n't have the faintest notion of what science is . They think it is all madmen in white coats who want to take over the world with giant cabbages that eat people .. . But science is n't a thing at all  --  like electricity or gravity or atoms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , but science is the process itself  --  the process of studying them , or anything else , for that matter . It is a process for arriving at conclusions about what is probably true , and what is probably not . That 's all . Its end product is simply reliable information . And the problem of knowing what to believe  --  what is true and what is not  --  is surely the most important problem that the human race has been grappling with for as long as it has existed . How many isms and ologies have been invented , all purporting to have the answer ? And what were their answers worth ? " He looked around . The others waited without interrupting . " Most systems set out to prove or rationalize something that they have made their minds up about already . But that 's a hopelessway to proceed if what you really want to know is the truth . Science does n't do that . Its goal is to understand what 's really out there  --  what the world is really like  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally uninfluenced by what you or I might choose to think , or by how many others we might persuadeto agree with us . The truth is n't impressed and does n't care . That 's why scientists do n't pay much attention to debating skills . We leave those to lawyers and theologians . The eloquence and emotional appeal of the way ideas are presented has nothing to do with whether they 're right or not . " " Pretty obvious when you think about it , " Cassidy commented . " Just plain common sense . " " But that 's all science is , Cassidy , " Einstein said . " Formalizedcommon sense . And since the purpose is to understand the world as it really is , and not to persuade anybody of anything in particular , there is no place for deception , especially **25;14084;TOOLONG . You ca n't get away with fooling yourself . Because all that will happen at the end of the process if you fail to detect your errors is that your aeroplane wo n't fly . The laws ofp162Nature , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong underlying ethical principle woven into the very fabric of the scientific process  --  something which is all too often overlooked . Would n't it be nice if the same were true in certain other fields of human activity ? " Einstein put down the mug and sat back to spread his hands on the table . " So instead of trying to prop up the things that it would like to be true , science does the opposite  --  it tries everythingit can think of to bring its ideas down . That 's what experimentsare designed to do  --  to prove theories false . And if the theory survives , it comes out so much the stronger . Hence , like an evolutionary process , which indeed it is , science is all the time testing itself and correcting itself . It thrives on questions , challenges , dissent , and criticism . The most ruthless scrutiny that it is subjected to is its own . And so it stays healthy and grows sturdier . " But how pathetic and fragile are the systems of thought that dare n't expose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems are forced to ban what they have no answers for , and to suppress everything they ca n't compete with . Eventually , they wither , and , they die . Eventually , the oppressors always end up being buried by their intended vic-tims . " Einstein took his pipe from his mouth and nodded solemnly . " So it will be with Hitler and his ' Reich that will last a thousand years , " he assured his listeners . " And that , gentlemen , is why I continue to have faith in people . "  |p163THE  CLASSICAL NEWTONIAN UNIVERSE was an orderly affair of billiard-ballparticles hurtling around on gravitational and **27;14111;TOOLONG and bouncing off one another according to straightforward rules which in principle operated down to arbitrarilysmall scales of magnitude . Thus , it was a vast machine , and only the limits of observational accuracy and the sheernumber of observations that would have been required prevented the motions of all its parts from being specified precisely at any instant that might be chosen . Every past and future state of the machine , everything that had happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be computed by applying Newtonian laws to this all-embracing snapshot and extrapolating it forward or backward in time . Whether such a stupendous computation was possible in practice was beside the point ; the conclusion still followed that the universe was determinate , its future states unfoldingas inevitably from past conditions as the cycles of the planets or the alignments of parts in a clockwork toy . This might have been good news for hedonists or conscience-plagued criminals , but it bothered those who believed in free will and liked to believe that free will had some part to play in the shaping of humanity 's future . By the close of the nineteenth century , however , the strawsp164of irrefutable experimental data were accumulating on the back of accepted theory , and the revolution in physics that followed had , by the 1920s , permanently demolished any notion of the subatomic realm as simply a Newtonian world in miniature . It was made up not of intuitively familiar , billiard-ball-like objects that occupied definite positions in space , moved along exact paths , and behaved generally as ordinary things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new conceptual entities without parallel at the everyday level , which could be described accurately only in the abstract mathematical formulations that emerged as quantummechanics . Of particular consequence , events in the quantummechanicalworld were not determinate : A given present situationdid not lead inexorably to an automatically defined future one . What was usually described as a particle , for example , ceased being a solid , immutable " thing " located in a pointlike " place " , and became something that physicists called a " wave function "  --  a vibrating haze that moved and spread through space , its shape and density pattern changing continually . A haze made up of what ? Nothing that had any physical attributes . But when it encounteredanother such entity , for example , by interacting with a measuring instrument designed to find out something about it , the act of interaction caused it to take on the properties more commonly thought of as " particle , " which would instantly localizesomewhere within the volume where the haze had been . Where it would localize exactly , nobody could say for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The density of the haze at any point as it vibrated and changed gave , from instant to instant , the probability that the particle would be found at that point . Quantum-mechanical billiards , therefore , was played with the balls zipping around inside separate smokescreens , and it was never possible to predict in advance precisely what the outcome of a given collision would be . But it was possible to predict what it would probably be , and such predictions could be tested by experiments based on repeating an event many times and observinghow frequently its various possible outcomes , in fact , occurred . Judged on the basis of its predictions in this way , quantum mechanics turned out to be , perhaps , science 's most successful theory ever . The universe was no longer clockwork ; but neither had it reverted to being clay capable of being molded to freely expressed human will , either . For the laws of chance had replaced those of determinism . The idea of dice running the universe botheredp165some people even more than that of rigid causality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Niels Bohr and I went over this again and again , " he said in German to Winslade , Scholder , Teller , and Szilard . They were standing in one of the cluttered instrumentation bays below the raised walkway running alongside the return-gate cylinder . They had been studying a section of the system , and on the far side of a partition wall formed by electrical panels and a vacuum pump , Wigner , Greene , and others from the Proteus team , were repeating some of the tests . " The thought of being a lemon in a fruit machine has always struck me as even more repugnant than being a tooth on a cogwheel , " Einstein said . " So , I view the theoryas still incomplete . The reason it yields uncertainties is that experiments are n't sensitive enough yet to uncover the variables that operate at even finer levels . " Szilard shook his head . " I 've never accepted that . If there 's no experimental evidence of such variables , then there 's no justificationfor assuming they exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . " Only the mathematical formalism has been verified , nothing else . The idea of invisible variables serves no other purpose than to satisfy your ideological conviction , Albert . It 's imposed metaphysics , not physics . " " So , you do n't subscribe to any interpretation , " Scholder said . Teller spread his hands . " Give me a guideline to construct one , and I 'll consider anything . But if it 's based on intuition , it will probably be misleading and hinder more than help . We 've seen that time and time again . " " What other approach is there ? " Szilard asked . Allow the mathematical formalism to yield its own interpretation , " Scholder replied . " Do n't try to impose anything on it . " A faraway look came over Einstein 's face . He stood up from the box that he had been sitting on and paced slowly toward the far wall , where he halted before a tool locker , his hands clasped behind his back . " Yes , philosophically that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others watched him for a second , then looked away as Scholder went on , " Could n't the big mistake all along have been in viewing the quantum realm as some kind of ghost world whose symbols represent only possibilities ? Could n't the symbolsof quantum mechanics represent reality faithfully , just as much as those of classical theory ? " " Faithfully ? " Teller glanced uncertainly at Szilard , then looked back at Scholder . " Well , anything 's possible , I suppose . But what does that mean ? "  |p166Szilard  frowned as he thought about it . " How could it even be possible ? " he objected . " There are two ways in which the wave function of an object can change . It can evolve continuously and predictably in time in the manner described by its differential wave equation ; or alternatively , it can interact with the wave function of another object , such as when an electron interacts with a measuring instrument , in which case the change is discontinuousand the result will be one of a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the two are fundamentally different . The first implies an isolated system , and the second does n't . That must give contradictions if we attempt to interpret it literally . How can an inherently selfcontradictingmodel represent reality ? " " Perhaps it 's our assumptions about reality that we should be questioning , " Einstein suggested to the tool locker . He turned to face the others . " Very well , let us allow the mathematical formalismto yield its own interpretation . So , what kind of interpretationhad it yielded by the twenty-first century , Dr. Scholder ? " " Contemporary physics regards the process of interaction  --  observation , if you will  --  as the collapsing of the wave function into one of its possible outcomes , " Scholder replied . " Which particularone it will collapse into is indeterminate , and the various possibilities can only be assigned a probability distribution . " The three twentieth-century scientists waited expectantly . Scholder went on , " But this collapsing process and the assignment of probabilitiesto the outcome do not follow from any of the dynamic equations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed upon the formalism  --  an assumption every bit as metaphysical as what Edward accused Albert of a few minutes ago . " There was a short silence . " But what alternative is there to collapsing the wave function ? " Szilard asked at last , looking puzzled . " Not collapsing it , " Scholder said . Nobody could dispute the logic of that . Szilard brought a hand up to massage his eyebrows . " But if we do n't collapse the function to one of its outcomes , we 'll be left with all of them , " he said slowly . " Would n't that force us to postulate the reality of all of them ? " A distant gleam had come into Einstein 's eyes . He paused as if to recheck his thoughts before voicing them , and then began nodding slowly . " Yes , that is being honest , is it not ? " he murmuredhalf to himself . " Simply to take the mathematics as meaning what it says and not try to constrain it with preconcep/tions of what it ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's right , " Scholder said . " Now follow that through and face up to the implications squarely . " Szilard and Teller stared at each other as they grappled with the meaning of it . Then Einstein began nodding his head more vigorously . " Yes , why not ? " he whispered . " The real universe could be far vaster than we have ever imagined  --  a gigantic superpositionof staggering complexity , in which every interaction generates its own set of branching outcomes . And since there is nothing in the formalism to designate any branch as being any more real than any other , why ca n't they all be equally real ? " " Let 's make sure I 'm getting this right , " Szilard said to Scholder . " You 're saying that if there are n number of possible outcomes of an event , it is n't true that Nature somehow picks one of them arbitrarily , by chance . " Scholder shook his head . " Why one rather than another ? " " No rules . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dice that I have always said God does n't play with . " " Then what instead ? " Teller asked . All of them , " Scholder replied simply . " When a die is rolled , why ca n't the decomposition of the state vector represent a branching function that leads to six different worlds , all equally real , where each one contains a different result ? " Teller slumped back in his chair by the electrical panels . Szilard got up and began pacing restlessly , rubbing his chin with a knuckle while he struggled to come to terms with the proposition . Einstein looked at Scholder . " So , the unpredictability would follow not from one outcome 's being selected randomly from a possible six , but from uncertainty about which of the six branches an individual would experience , " he said . " In other words , which outcome would come to correlate with his sense of identity . His memories would be a correlated set of outcomes of previous interactions , a kind of path traced through a tree of constantlybranching possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a short silence , interrupted only by the sound of Szilard 's pacing and Payne 's voice from the far side of the partition , muttering numbers to somebody . " But there would have to be a different copy of him in each of the six worlds , " Szilard said at last . He stopped , and his eyes widened as the full implication registered . " Copies of everything , in fact  --  the world , everything  --  notjust six times over , but for everything happening , ev-erywhere .... "  | " Now I think I am beginning to see a little more clearly where this is leading , " Einstein said . He took out his pipe and began filling it . Szilard went on , ' Any cause , however microscopic , could ultimatelypropagate its effects throughout the universe . If what Kurt 's saying is true , then every quantum transition in every star , every galaxy , every remote corner of the cosmos , is splitting the universe into copies . . . . Every one of countless billions of variationsmultiplying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branching tree in which everything that might happen , does happen . . . somewhere . " " You see what I meant by the universe being bigger than we thought , " Einstein said . " What we perceive turns out to be an infinitesimally tiny part of the whole , a path traced through the totality by a correlated set of memories and impressions . " He puffed his pipe and gave a satisfied nod . " I must say that it appealsto me . The entire ensemble is deterministic , for all possible outcomes of any cause are firmly embedded in it ; and yet the path traced through it by an individual 's experiences can be influenced by what we call free will , in ways we have yet to understand . Yes , gentlemen , this makes me feel much happier . " The other two nodded slowly as they took it all in . It was becoming clear now how multiple futures could exist that could n't have evolved from present circumstances : how Hitler , for example , could be in communication with a 2025 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The line of events that had led to the future where Nazism was unknown and which Kurt Scholder had come from still existed somewhere in the ever-branching tree of possibilities and outcomes . It existed , in fact , as just one of countless lines leading to a whole sub-tree made up of countless Nazi-free futures , a countless number of which had sent countless Kurt Scholders back into the past , and , no doubt , a countless number of which had n't . And it was clear what had gone wrong with the communicationsconnection from 1975 : somehow , a crossed line had occurred , giving them contact not with their own selves as they had assumed , but with some other version of themselves whowere from some other 1975 and had arrived in some other 1939 . This still did n't help with the immediate problem of gettingthe return-gate operational . The gate was a slave device , operatingpassively in response to the main projector that was supposedto activate it from 1975 , at the same time conveying from 1975the required operating power  --  to prevent Gatehouse from suckingBrooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make calls out . But on the basis of what Scholder had said ,  |p169there  ought to have been lots of versions of the 1975 projector attempting to call in . But nothing was happening . Something was fundamentally wrong , somewhere . Szilard was looking curiously at Scholder . " What I do n't understandis why , if you knew about all this , you did n't explain more of it to Lindemann when you were in England , " he said . " He did n't seem to have any inkling of these concepts when I talked to him by telephone . " Winslade moved across from where he had been listening . " I asked Kurt to be vague over there because of their uncertain situationand the risk of leaks , " he said . " We could n't afford to let the Germans pick up even a whisper of things like this being discussed on our side . But you can see now why we need help . The situation makes no sense . What , I wonder , did the team who got through from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out yet ? " Einstein nodded . " We need a better understanding of the physics of this strange new domain , " he said . " Then you people will be in a better position to tackle the practical issues . Here , we have one end of a communications link that is in working order . The other end , we know , is talking , but nothing comes through . What could account for that ? An interesting problem , I think . " Over on the far side of Manhattan , Jeff and his fellow student Asimov were walking down the steps of Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia after a lecture . " You ought to take some time off and get into town sometime to meet them , " Jeff said . " That guy Gordonthat I mentioned knows all kinds of things about atomic physics . It beats me where he got it from . " " Maybe . . . if I can find some free time , " Asimov said . " But right now I 'm working on another idea for a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immediately Asimov became more enthusiastic and began gesticulating as they walked . " Well , there 's a spaceship trapped on a planet that 's deep in the gravity-well of a giant star . The crew are trying to send a distress message out . But because of the time dilation caused by the gravity field , their time runs slower and they do n't realize that all their radio frequencies are shifted .... " " Would they be able to survive if the field was that strong ? " Jeff asked dubiously . " Yes , well , that 's the part I 'm trying to figure out , " Asimov admitted . " But what do you think ? " Jeff reflected for a while , then shook his head . " I do n't think you 'll be able to make it work , " he replied dubiously.  |p170THE  EVENING WAS STILL young , and the Rainbow 's End was fairly quiet . A couple of people were at the bar and some more groups and couples at the tables , mostly city workers and businessmen easing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going home . Few of the regulars had arrived yet , and nobody took any notice of Walther Fritsch as he checked his coat at the door and stood looking around while his eyes adjusted to the lighting  --  he had left on his dark glasses . Then he walked across the floor and took one of the empty stools at the bar . " Hi , " Lou , the bartender , greeted gruffly as Fritsch sat down . " What can I getcha ? " " Good evening . Er , perhaps der Stin-ger , please ? " " One Stinger " Lou turned away and reached for a glass . Fritsch scanned the place again , just to be sure . Neither of the two men who had given Fritsch and his niece a ride back into Manhattan  --  the big fair-haired one with the mustache , or the darker , olive-skinned companion  --  was present ; nor was there any sign of the man they had called Johnny , who had arrived at the house later with the gangsters . Feeling more secure , Fritsch turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't proved difficult to trace the girl named in the newspaperarticle . She had given him the lead to the Rainbow 's End ,  |p171which  , she 'd told him , was where Johnny Six Jays usually hung out . She 'd never seen or heard of the ones called Cassidy and Harry before , though . Berlin 's failure to mention his report in their last message had been disappointing . He felt they were n't taking him seriously . He wanted to produce something that would convince them of his worth . Events were sweeping toward a climax in Europe , and at such a momentous hour it behooved loyal Party members everywhere to contribute their maximum effort . And besides , Fritsch was curious , personally . A cozy place , " Fritsch remarked . " I take it ziss is not its busiest . " " It 'll liven up later , " Lou grunted . " My first visit here . My name is Johann , incidentally . " " Glad to meetcha . " Fritsch took a slow sip and set the glass down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might possibly be able to help me .

Zank you . " Fritsch raised his glass again while Lou moved away a short distance to fill an ice bucket . " I haff n't seen him for a vile now , " Fritsch went on absently . " Vat he is doing these days ? Do you happen to know ? " " You 've got me . " George , the piano player , turned from where he had been halflisteningon the next stool . " I can help you , mister , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someplace over in Brooklyn , did n't someone say ? " He glanced at Lou , but Lou frowned , shook his head , and moved to the far end of the bar . George did n't catch the warning . " One of the warehouses around the basins south of the bridge , " he told Fritsch . " I think someone said it was Maloney 's old place  --  yes , that was it  --  Maloney 's . " " Tell me again vere ziss is , " Fritsch said , leaning closer . Lou , standing with his back to them at the far end , shook his head again as he set out dishes of olives , pickle slices , and pretzels . If Johnny Six Jays was happy to mind his own business about what people like Harry and Cassidy did , then that should have been good enough for everyone else . George blabbed too much . One day it would get him into trouble.  |p172In  Brooklyn , meanwhile , the group at Gatehouse had spent the first day of August polishing the last details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchanged in its essentials : The seriousness of fission research and the possibility of an atomic bomb would be used as a pretext to attract official attention , and the full story would be revealed when toplevelcontact was made . Nothing could be risked that might lead Hitler and Overlord to suspect they might not have a monopoly on Pipe Organ technology ; nothing could be committed to paper , therefore , that remotely hinted at the existence of the Proteus mission or its purpose . On August 2 , Teller and Szilard made a second trip to Einstein'srented summer house , this time in Teller 's 1935 Plymouth , and took with them the final draft of the letter they had composed for him to sign . It read : Albert yinsteinOld Grove Rd . Hassau PointPeconic , Long IslandAugust 2nd , 1939 . D. Roosevelt , President of the united States , Mite HouseWashington , D.S.Sir : Some recent work by . ? ermi and L. Szilard , which has been communicated to me in mr , nuscript , leads me to expect that the element uraniummay be turned into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for  --  atc ' ulness and , if necessary , quick action on the part of the Administration . I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations : In the course of the last four months it has been made probable - through the work of Joliot in ? rance as well as 7ermi and Szilard in America - that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium , by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated . Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future . This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs , and it is conceivable - though much less certain - that extremely power/ful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed . A single bomb of this type , carried by boat and exploded in a port , might very well destroy the whole port together with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air . The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities . There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia , while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo . In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Ad-ministration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America . One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity . His task might comprise the following : a ) to asproach Government Departments , keep them informed of the further development , and out forward recommendations for Government action , givin particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uraniumore for the United States ; b ) to speed un the experimental rork , which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories , by proviaine funds , if such funds be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to make contributions for this cause , and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment . I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over . That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State , von Weizsicker , is attached to the Kaiser-7ilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated . Yours very truly , ( Albert Einstein )  |p174Szilard  took the signed letter to Alexander Sachs , and at Sachs 's suggestion added a memorandum of his own , making the point that a chain reaction with slow neutrons was a virtual certainty , and one with fast neutrons , though less certain , would make a bomb highly probable . Then Sachs wrote a covering letter of his own to complete the dossier and departed to arrange a suitableappointment with Roosevelt . And so , for once , everything appeared to be going smoothly ... . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claud , you wo n't believe what they 've done over here , " she almost screamed in the ear of a startled Winslade . " Chamberlain'ssending a fossil admiral to head up the military talks in Moscow  --  he 's pratically on the retired list ! And the staff he 's taking with him are only tacticians . They do n't have any strategicexperience . And even if they had , they do n't have any negotiatingauthority . It 's straight out of Gilbert and Sullivan . And that 's not all . Claud , do you believe this  --  they 're going there by boat ! " " Damn ! " " Russians wo n't stand for it , Claud , certainly not after the way they were snubbed at Munich . Stalin has set up people like Voroshilov , Shaposhnikov  --  some of the highest Soviet officers . They 're serious . They want to talk business . This will only drive them straight into the arms of Hitler . " Sure enough , Hitler , sensing an unexpected opportunity , instructed his ambassador in Moscow to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian responsewas positive , and by the second week of August , while Admiral Drax and his party were still chugging sedately up the Baltic , Hitler was pushing for the German Foreign Minister , Ribbentrop , to meet directly with the Soviet premier . Stalin agreed , after extracting as a prerequisite handsome concessions in aIII trade and credit agreement . On August 22 , it was announced publicly that Ribbentrop would be arriving in Moscow the very next day . The implications were catastrophic as far as any hopes of averting the attack on Poland were concerned . By the time Ribbentropleft Berlin , Winslade was already on his way back across the Atlantic . Major Warren accompanied him this time in order to observe the military situation firsthand and meet some of the British commanders . He wanted to explore the possibility of gettingreplacements from the British Army for the military rein/forcements that should have materialized in July from the Proteus world . Winslade and Warren arrived in London in the early hours of August 25 . By that time , the Russo-German Nonaggression Pact had already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p176WINSLADE  HAD NEEDED TO be away for a short while to really notice , but something was different in the atmosphere pervading England . It manifested itself not as anything obvious or dramatic , but as a subtle alteration in the mind and mood of the people , and the tenor of the press that mirrored them . He wondered if perhaps he had been looking for the wrong things too soon . The untiring efforts of Churchill and the others had perhaps been achieving results , after all  --  results , possibly , that would prove more important in the long run , and from which all else would flow in time . ' Abaht time , too , if there is a punch-up , that 's wot I say , " the porter carrying the bags remarked in the elevator when Winslade checked back into the Hyde Park Hotel with Major Warren . " Mister'itler 's been arstin ' for trouble long enough , and it 's time someone give it ' im . Russians ? They do n't make no difference to me . A lot o ' bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firmness seemed to be taking hold in the higher levels of government , too , Bannering said , when he and Anthony Eden arrived at the hotel for breakfast the next morning . The day before the Nazi-Soviet pact was announced , the British Cabinet had reaffirmed categorically that the obligation to Poland would in no way he affected . By August 25 , twop177days after the pact , negotiations were being rushed through with the Polish ambassador in London to get signatures on a formal treaty before the day was through . This was in sharp contrast to the attitude taken in the previous world , where the Allies had used the Polish refusal to accept Russian aid as an excuse to declaretheir guarantee invalidated . Now the guarantee was firm , even though this time Russia and Germany  --  for the moment , anyway  --  were solidly in cahoots . The political scene throughout Europe was confused , and few doubted that war could be more than days away at most . As August 25 wore on , news arrived that the German Foreign Office had wired embassies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuation of German citizens by the quickest route . In Moscow , Voroshilov terminated the Soviet-British talks on the grounds that they no longer served any useful purpose . British and French press correspondents in Berlin were leaving for the frontiers , while neutral observers there reported antiaircraftguns being set up all over the city and bombers flying overhead continuously , toward the east . Only the members of the Proteus mission and the few whom they had taken into their confidence knew that by then in the former world , Hitler had already ordered the attack on Poland to commence at four-thirty the following morning , Saturday , August26 . That was how it had happened even without Soviet collusion ; who , then , could doubt that Hitler , with the only real risk to his first major gamble in overt hostilities eliminated , would do other than take full advantage of his diplomatic triumph by pressing forward as planned with all the speed and force at his disposal ? And yet , strangely , that was not how things turned out . The dawn hours of August 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Late in the morning , Eden brought reportsof apparent last-minute doubts and hesitation among the Nazi high command . The evening before , a Swedish businessmancalled Dahlerus had arrived in London as a go-between sent by Goering to convey Germany 's willingness to seek an " understanding " on the current situation . And then , early in the morning , the British ambassador in Berlin , Sir Nevile Henderson , had followed independently to present Foreign Secretary Halifax with preposterous proposals from Hitler guaranteeing the integrityof the British Empire and pledging Germany to defend it in the event of its being threatened . So , even with Russia neutralized , his military preparations complete , and Overlord behind him , a single gesture by the Allies of their determination to meet force with force had been sufficient to cause Hitler to falterp178at the last minute . It was a sobering indication of how differently the events of the past several years might have run had such a precedent been set from the beginning . Dahierus returned to Berlin that evening with a noncommitalreply , and was back in London again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memorized six-point offer put together overnight by Hitler and Goering . But the proposals he brought were not the same as those conveyed previously by Hendersonand seemed to be the start of a refrain that sounded painfullyfamiliar after Munich . Chamberlain expressed skepticism that any settlement could be considered on such terms and sent the indefatigable Swede back to Berlin with an unofficial response , to report back by phone on its reception before an official version was sent with Henderson . The British position remained essentially that they desired good relationships with Germany , but would stand by their obligation to Poland if she were attacked . Germany 's offer to protect the British Empire was politelydeclined . Hitler agreed to accept this standpoint provided that Britain undertook to persuade Poland to enter into immediate negotiationswith Germany . Accordingly , Halifax wired the British ambassadorin Warsaw to prevail upon the Poles for authorization to inform Hitler that Poland was agreeable . This they did , and Hendersonwas welcomed back to Berlin on the evening of August 28 by an honor guard of SS to deliver the official British note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jubilant that peace had been secured , but others more experienced in Hitler 's ways retained a cooler , wait-and-see attitude . Their wisdom was borne out by the official German reply , which reached London early on August 29 and stated that friendship with Britain could not be bought at the price of renouncing Germany'svital interests . It then launched into a familiar tirade of alleged Polish misdeeds and provocations and insisted on the returnof Danzig and the Baltic Corridor . Finally , it demanded as an indication of good faith the dispatch to Berlin of a Polish emissarywith full negotiating powers not later than August 30 . The last part contained the trap . By its arrogant insinuation that Poland was expected to send its emissary scurrying at the snap of Hitler 's fingers  --  clearly an intended prelude to more of the kind of treatment that had been handed out to the ministers of previous victim nations  --  the demand made Polish rejection all but certain . If the Poles declined to send a negotiator , or even if they did and Hitler 's terms were rejected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " peaceful settlement , " and Britainp179and France would have a justification for washing their hands of the business . " It 's a strange feeling now that this is really happening , " Anna Kharkiovitch whispered in an awed voice when the team assembled in Winslade 's hotel room at midday to hear the latest . " History is actually changing moment by moment from what we remember , and it 's because of what we did . It 's uncanny . " Duff Cooper looked thoughtful . " Right now , Hitler could well be more confused than we are , " he mused . " He 's been confidentthat we 'd seize the first chance we got to wriggle out , just as in your world . " " That explains what 's happening , " Bannering said , nodding . " He 's trying to give us an out . He does n't know that anything 's been changed , and neither does Overlord . They ca n't know . They do n't possess a connection to our world of 1975 and its history . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in that world this situation never happened . There , the Nazis faded away years ago . " By this time , none of the British diplomats or ministers had any stomach for another Munich . The Poles had never for a momentconsidered one . The British ambassador in Warsaw wired Halifax that they would sooner fight and perish than send a representative of their nation to be bullied and humiliated . If Hitler really wanted to negotiate , the Poles said , they would negotiate as equals in some neutral country . Accordingly , Henderson arrived at the German Foreign Officeat midnight on August 30 to deliver a note stating that Britaincould not advise Poland to comply with the German demands . Ribbentrop , the German Foreign Minister , began aping Hitler at his worst by launching into a hysterical denunciation , but for once the shock-tactic of insult and intimidation failed to work . In a heated exchange that the German interpreter would later describe as " the stormiest I have experienced in twentythreeyears , " the Englishman outshouted the German , and at one point both men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily that they seemed about to come to blows . When Henderson asked for the promised German proposals , Ribbentropread them aloud in German , speaking so quickly that Henderson could do no more than gather the gist of a few of them , after which Ribbentrop refused to supply a written copy of the text . It was out of date in any case , he maintained , since the Poles had not sent a plenipotentiary as stipulated . Henderson did finally obtain a copy indirectly from Goering the next day . The terms contained in the document turned out top180be generous  --  extraordinarily so  --  and would undoubtedly have formed a meaningful basis for negotiations had they been conveyed to the Polish government in time . But Hitler had never intended that they should be . They were a hoax , intended simply to fool the German people and foreign observers , as they succeeded in doing to a large degree when Hitler broadcast them at nine o'clock that night , August 31 . For by then , the decision had been made . All the frantic eleventh-hourdiplomatic scrambling that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already futile . At a half-hour after noon , Hitler had issued his final directive for the attack on Poland to commence at dawn the next day , September 1 , 1939 . Churchill , who had gone to France in a last-minute effort to sow more of the defiance that was taking root in England , had returned a few days before the end of August ; his wife , Clementine , followed via Dunkirk on the thirtieth . They decided to move into their Pimlico flat to be nearer the center of developments , and arrived to find the newspapers carrying banner headlinesof German armies pouring into Poland under an umbrella of ceaseless air attack , with the British Army mobilizing and the evacuation of children from the cities already in progress . The only light relief was Mussolini 's declaration that Italy was stayingout . Evidently , I1 Duce had thought twice about taking on the French Army and the British Mediterranean Fleet . So much for the Pact of Steel . That same afternoon another event occurred that had not taken place in the previous history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team 's efforts had brought about . Prime Minister Chamberlain invited Churchill to become a member of the War Cabinet he was forming to conduct the war that he now saw no hope of averting . Chamberlain 's eyes at last were fully open , and there would be no question in this world of staging a mere sham war to satisfy world opinion . Whether he would prove forceful enough for the job , however , was another matter . At nine o'clock that evening , Sir Nevile Henderson handed Ribbentrop a formal warning that Britain would , without hesitation , fulfil its obligations toward Poland if the German forces were not withdrawn . The French ambassador delivered an identicallyworded note one hour later . The French would have to bear the brunt if the Germans attacked in the west ; to facilitate French mobilization , Chamberlain tried playing for time when he addressed the House of Commons late on September 2 . Butp181the members would have none of it . After thirty-nine hours of unprovoked war in Poland , they were angry , impatient , and more than suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government benches . After a heated session , the government was in a precarious position and more than likely to topple if it failed to deliver the answer the nation wanted , and soon . The pace of events that the Proteus team had set in motion had now gone far beyond their capacity to influence further . For the time being , they were reduced to passive observers , able to piece together only a fragmentary picture from accounts brought by others of pandemonium in the Foreign Office , ceaseless phone calls to and from Paris , and rumors of a final ultimatum being issued jointly with the French . Then a news bulletin early the following morning , a Sunday , announced that the Prime Minister would address the nation that morning at eleven-fifteen . Winslade and the others breakfastedwith the Churchills before listening to the broadcast . It had been obvious for some time that the inevitable social contact would either compel the Proteus people to reveal their true identities to Clementine or lie to her . Since Churchill had refused to contemplate the latter , she now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking her to France had been to broach the subject in suitably detached surroundings . After her initial shock , she had adjusted to the situation with an aplomb that befitted a lady of her character and background . " I suppose that if you 're from 1975 , you could , if you wished , tell what is going to happen to all of us . . . or at least , what happened in your world , " she had remarked to Winslade over dinnerthe evening she arrived in London . " It tempts one to be curi-ous . " " I could , " Winslade agreed . " But would you really like me to ? " After a long silence , she said , " No . . . . On reflection , I do n't think it would be very wise , do you ? " " I think you are very wise . " " Do you ever discuss such matters ? " " No. , , ' A most commendable precedent , Mr. Winslade . Yes , I agree  --  let 's stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everyone 's thoughts were focused very much upon the present . Conversation across the breakfast table was sparse and the atmosphere solemn as the hour of eleven passed . Then the announcer introduced the Primep182Minister , and the clatter of cutlery ceased and teacups were set aside as Chamberlain 's voice came from the radio , sounding strained , but resolute . " I am speaking to you from the Cabinet Room at Ten DowningStreet . This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final Note stating that unless we heard from them by eleven o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland a state of war would exist between us . I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received , and that consequently this country is at war with Germany .... " Silence reigned for a long time after the address was over . Eventually Churchill said , " I must confess that despite the gravityof this moment , I find myself unable to suppress a certain feeling of elation . Glorious old England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer her call to duty once again . After my dejection at hearing how in your world we groveledand were destroyed , this brings relief and serenity of mind indeed . " He paused for a second or two and then shook his head sadly . " But how much we have sacrificed . The Rhine frontier , Italy , Austria , Czechoslovakia 's fortress line , now Poland . . . all gone . How different it would have been if we could only have mustered our courage and determination years ago . " " True , " Anna Kharkiovitch replied . She toyed with her teaspoonfor a second or two and then looked up again . " But it 's possible that in the long run it could turn out to be for the best . " Churchill looked puzzled . " How so ? " " Because , morally , the West 's credentials are now beyond question , " she replied . " The world has witnessed that every attemptat appeasement , reason , compromise , and accommodation has failed , and the only resort left now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America in on our side ultimately , this does . And that would be worth far more than all the things you mentionedput together . " " Provided , of course , that we survive long enough for Americato get in on the act , " Winslade commented . " Yes , " Anna agreed dryly . " Of course , there is always that . " Then a low moaning began somewhere outside the building and rose rapidly to a sustained wail . The sound was already familiarfrom airraid practice drills  --  the warning of enemy bombersapproaching . " Well , one has to give the Germans some credit for promptitude , I suppose , " Clementine conceded . The party went up to the roof to see what was happening . The rooftops and spires of London lay spread out all around them in the September sun , and above , even as they watched , scores ofp183silvery , blimp-shaped balloons of the antiaircraft barrage were rising slowly on every side . In the streets below , steel-helmeted air raid wardens were directing scattered groups of people toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slung from a shoulder-strap , containing a gas mask . The bright red Post Office mailboxes had been fitted with a yellow warning panel that was supposed to change color in the event of a gas attack . So , finally , it had come . " Now we 'll see , " Churchill murmured to Winslade through his cigar . Winslade nodded distantly as he stared out over the city . In the world that the team had come from , the outbreak of war had not brought the devastating air assault on the cities of England and France that most people believed would be inevitable ; Hitler had n't wanted to provoke action in the West while the German forces were engaged in Poland , and in any case expected the Allies to opt out after the Polish cause had gone away . There were no grounds for supposing anything had changed in that respectin this world . But the analysts advising Chamberlain and his government knew nothing about that , of course , and had produced gruesome forecasts of the numbers of dead and maimed to be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months . Haunted by visions of entire city populations driven to hysteria by bombs , gas , and a collapse of social and medical services , the government had laid secret plans for the mass disposal of bodies by dumping them in lime pits and from hoppers at sea . Even Churchill had mollified his views about Chamberlain when Bannering pointed out these facts . " If that is what he believedwould be the alternative , it makes it easier to be more charitable before glibly accusing him of moral cowardice at Munich , " Churchill conceded . " I still believe we should have fought , but I can see why he would consider the year that he purchased to be worth its high price . " In the team 's world the Luftwaffe had n't been turned on Englanduntil the end of 1940 . " If that pattern is adhered to in this world , and if by the grace of God I should come to have any influenceover the course of events , " Churchill promised grimly , " we will be ready . And this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Winslade stared for a second . " Do you really believe there 's a God ? " he asked curiously . " It does n't matter , " Churchill said . " One should behave as if there were , anyway . " They then went down to the shelter a hundred yards or so along the street , taking with them a bottle of brandy and some ofp184Churchill 's other " medicinal comforts . " The incident turned out to be a false alarm , and they returned after half an hour to the flat . Later that afternoon , Chamberlain spoke to Churchill again to offer him , as well as a seat in the War Cabinet , the post of First Lord of the Admiralty  --  the position that Churchill had held at the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 . Churchill accepted at once , and by six o'clock in the evening was back in his old office and chair , with the same wooden map-case beside him that he had had made during his previous tenure , and inside it the same charts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Kaiser 's High Seas Fleet . The signal WINSTON IS BACK was sent out from the Admiralty to all ships and bases of the Royal Navy . So as far as major historic events were concerned  --  what had happened and when  --  the net effect so far of the Proteus mission had been to delay Britain 's entry into the war by three days . Chronologically speaking , it did n't amount to very much . But in terms of the underlying " how " and " why , " there was all the difference in the world  --  grounds for hope , possibly , that the changes the team had been anxiously awaiting for many months might suddenly start coming in a torrent.  |p185WITH  FIVE OF THE team  --  Bannering , Anna , Selby , Winslade , and Warren  --  now in England , demand for the vehicles at Gatehouse had slackened . So Ferracini and Cassidy , along with Ed Payne , borrowed the sedan for a night out on the town  --  a black , 1936 four-door Packard , built as solid as a tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grilled front , and a luxurious leathery smell pervading its inside . After crossing the river to Manhattan , they stopped at Max 's to collect Janet , Pearl , and Amy , and then drove north out of the city , heading for the shore of Long Island Sound beyond Eastchester Bay . Going to the Glen Island Casino had been Ferracini 's idea . He had been curious to see the place ever since Winslade described it to him in a limousine en route from a submarine berth in Virginia , seemingly a thousand years ago . Ferracinihad particularly wanted to make it that night because the Glenn Miller Band was playing . The parking lot around the building was nearly full when they arrived , and more cars were coming in through the gates by the minute . They spilled out , already in high spirits , and joined the stream of people converging upon the doors . The evening was warm and calm , with barely a breeze stirring the surrounding trees . The Casino stood out in floodlights against the smoothp186waters of the Sound , rippling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet-black , cloudless sky . They reached the door behind a party of people blowing squeakers , wearing party hats , and making a lot of noise . One of the girls with the group had a bunch of balloons and held them out invitingly . " I just got married today . Have a balloon . " Amy took two and tied them to the front of her dress , and Janet screamed with laughter . Cassidy was wearing a derby that he had acquired at Max 's somehow . Pearl had been celebrating something or other since early evening and was already a little tipsy . It looked as if it would be a good night . The hall was packed and boisterous . The musicians , on raised tiers under spotlights at the far end , were wearing maroon blazers with black ties . They were already in full swing with a thumping , exuberant rendition of " Little Brown Jug . " The lightingwas soft , the air smoky , and the floor a mass of bobbing , twirlingbodies clad in everything from white-jacketed tuxedos and evening gowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people ran halfway along one of the sides , and tables , mostly taken , filled the remainder of the area around the floor . As they began threading their way through the room , Glenn Miller himself rose to take the trombone solo . Ferracini stopped moving and stared . The distinctive profile , familiar now from the many photographs that he had seen since that day in Norfolk , Virginia  --  clean-shaven , high-browed , receding hairline , goldrimmedspectacles  --  was discernible even at that distance . Many times during the training period at Tularosa , Ferracini had lain on his bunk alone in one of the billets and listened to recordings like this , trying to picture what the mission would be like . Now , in that moment , it seemed that the past had finally come alive . Or had the " present " that was now gone finally died ? " Hey , Harry , come on  --  I see a table . " Cassidy 's voice jerked him back from his momentary reverie . Janet grabbed Ferracini 's hand and tugged him along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Anyone would think you 'd never heard a band before . " They arranged the chairs as best they could in the cramped space left between the people at adjacent tables , and sat down . Amy sat on Cassidy 's knee . Cassidy grinned and cupped her balloonssuggestively . She had a pretty face and blonde hair that curled forward to form points in front of her ears , and she was wearing a straight , pale blue dress , reminiscent of the flapper style of the twenties . She and Cassidy had been getting along well , on and off , in a casual kind of way ever since the first nightp187that she and Janet had met him and Ferracini and brought them to Max 's . Ed Payne managed to catch a waitress and ordered drinks . Pearl reached into her purse , lit a cigarette , and tossed the pack and lighter down on the table . " So where did Gordon go ? " she asked . " I have n't seen him for weeks . " " He had to go away , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked Cassidy . " Europe . " " Do n't tell me  --  to look at pictures , " Pearl guessed . " Is Gordona collector or something ? Always going somewhere to look at pictures . " " Just business this time , " Ferracini said . Pearl shook her head and sighed . " Do you know , I still do n't know what kind of business you guys are in . Is it some kinda secret , am I just slow , or what ? Everything I hear gets confusing . " " Why worry about it now ? " Janet said . " I thought this was a night out . What happened to the party ? " " Yeah , what about the party ? " Cassidy agreed . " Nobody 's dancing yet , and we 've been here at least five minutes . Well , I reckon there 's  --  " " Hey , cut that out ! " Amy shrieked . " The balloon burst . " " I heard a joke about balloons , " Pearl said . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing is these balloons , and a guy says ... " She stopped and frowned . " No , wait a minute . . . . Oh , heck , I 've forgotten how it goes . I 'm always doing this . " A girl shows up at a costume party , and all she 's wearing is a black bra and a pair of black shoes , " Payne said . He looked around the table expectantly . Pearl shrugged ; Amy frowned . " Okay , I 'll buy it , " Janet said . " What is she ? " " The Five of Spades ! Ha-ha ! " Payne thumped the table gleefully , Cassidy roared , and the others joined in . Ferracini grinned . " What 's black and crispy , and hangs on the ceiling ? " he asked . Nobody knew . Being an Italian American , he usually told it as a Polish joke . But suddenly he remembered that the day before , with Hitler 's armies storming onward into Poland from the west , the Russians had attacked without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hapless country . It was n't a time for jokes like that . A lousy electrician , " he said instead . It was good enough , and the others laughed . Then the drinks arrived and jokes were forgotten for the time being . Pearl took a long sip from her glass , then sat back and closed her eyes . She shook her head disbelievingly . " Oh , jeez .. .  |p188should  n't have started so early . I need to work some of this stuff off . " She looked at Payne . " How come you have n't asked me to dance yet , Ed ? " " How about a dance ? " Payne obliged cheerfully . " That 's what I like in a guy  --  decisiveness . I thought you 'd never ask . Let 's go . " They stood up , and Payne took her elbow and steered her away in the direction of the throng on the dance floor , now jumping and gyrating to " I 've Got a Gal in **25;14140;TOOLONG . " Amy was now wearing Cassidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the club you were a gunrunner in South America ? " she asked , turning to accuse him . Cassidy made a face of protesting innocence . " Me ? When ? " " Yes , you  --  last Friday . " " What girl ? " " The dumb-looking one in the slinky dress . You know who I 'm talking about . " Cassidy turned his palms upward . " Okay , you 've got me . In my blameless innocence of youth , I 'm unable to tell a lie . I did it to make you jealous . I figured it might improve my chances of getting laid  --  you might be easier if you feel you have to com-pete . " " Cassidy , you 're impossible ! I do n't believe this . " Ferracini had gone quiet . In his mind 's eye , he was picturing waves of Stukas peeling and diving over defenseless towns , and refugees with their children trudging along endless , weary miles of road , pushing the remains of their belongings in handcarts while behind them their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , while people drank and laughed and danced . Somehow , there was an air of unreality about it all . He felt Janet 's hand close around his arm . " Come on , Harry , " she said in his ear . " This is no time to get melancholy . " She was right . There was nothing he could do . He nodded and summoned a grin . " Then do a better job of making sure I do n't . " " Like to dance ? I do n't have to wait for you to ask . " " I do n't feel athletic right now . How about waiting for somethingslower ? " " Sure . " Later , when the mood had mellowed , they danced for a long time . Janet did n't speak much but clung very close , as if she were trying to say something with her body that she did n't want to put into words . Ferracini was content to enjoy her closeness and softnesswhile inwardly savoring the strange feeling of a woman giv/ing herself , symbolically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , too , was new to him . In his world , people had rarely given themselves to anybody . The prospective future had been too short and demanding for things like that . Afterward , they went out onto the terrace , where people were taking a few minutes of fresh air and looking at the necklaceof lights along the Long Island shoreline and the colored lamps of the boats on the Sound . Janet pressed close and snuggled in his arms for a while . At last , she loosened herself to study his face curiously for a few seconds . " I do n't want to make you mad or anything , Harry , but . . . well , you have n't had a lot to do with girls , have you ? " There was nothing that he knew of to feel offended about . He grinned faintly and shrugged . " Not really . " That was the easiestthing to say . His had been a world of constant threat and danger , where everyone lived each day with the feeling that time was limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and available fairly freely ; but deep commitment , involving as it did too much risk of pain and loss , was more often avoided . In this world , it was the other way around . People dug emotional hooks into each other and got possessive even before there was anything to get possessive about . There seemed to be a whole - minefield of unwritten rules and conventions , and he had decided that he had better things to do than get mixed up in them . Or was that a rationalization ? Was he unwilling to risk being rejected for doing the wrong thing ? Janet misread his frankness as a signal for help . She moved closer again , kissed his mouth , and whispered against his shoulder , " Do n't get any wrong ideas and think I do this all the time , Harry , but we could make it so it 's just us . . . alone , I mean . Jeff 's working late and will be staying with a couple of the guys at the university tonight . The flat 'll be empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know if I want you to get that involved . " Janet giggled softly . " Harry , you really do say the strangest things at times . Sometimes I think you 're from some other planet . " " What I mean is , before long I 'll be going away , " he told her . " I do n't know exactly when , and there 's no telling how long . I just do n't want ... " Janet did n't show any great surprise . " Overseas ? " she asked . " Yes . " " But you will be coming back again , wo n't you ? " " Sure . "  |p190Janet  did n't seem reassured . " Is it . . . well , dangerous ? " " Look , I really ca n't go into it . . . . We 've talked about this before . " Janet moved back to see his face . " I guess I 've been halfexpectingit for a while , " she said . " Jeff worked out his own theory . Want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferracini said . " He figures the government is worried about Hitler and the Nazis getting the bomb that he 's always talking about , and that you 're with a secret part of the Army that 's been trained to go into Europe and sabotage their program . " " Even though we 're not at war ? " " Jeff thinks it 's important enough for that not to matter . Anyhow , there 's a good chance we will be , the way things are going . And even if we do n't , it could still be done undercover , through a deal with the British , maybe . Jeff figures that perhaps that was why the King of England came over to see the President a couple of months back . " " Ingenious , " Ferracini granted . He hoped he was managing to remain poker-faced enough to conceal just how ingenious . Am I supposed to comment ? " Janet sighed . " No , I guess not . It 's just that , well , when you do go away , wherever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you . You know what I mean . Do n't think nobody cares what happens . " Ferracini drew her closer and looked at her face for a long time . She met his eyes unblinkingly . " Really ? " he asked at last . " Really . " She nodded . He hesitated for a second . " What you were saying about Jeff a few minutes back ... " " If you go away , I 'd like to think you 'll remember me , too . " " We could slip away and get a cab , I guess ... " " I did just happen to bring my coat out with me . " " Well , yes , I had kinda noticed . " " You never miss anything , do you ? " " Only lots of opportunities , maybe . " Janet laughed and took his hand . " Then do n't make this another one . Come on , let 's go . "  |p191ON  SEPTEMBER 11 , FRANKLIN Delano Roosevelt , President of the United States , sent a curious letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Admiralty again and welcoming further communication on a personal basis . . For a head of state to initiate such contact with a subordinateminister  --  and one not responsible for foreign dealings , at that  --  of another state was unorthodox , to say the least ; and what made the incident more remarkable was that they were not even casually acquainted . They had met once , briefly , at a luncheonin London in 1918 that Roosevelt had attended as AssistantSecretary of the Navy , in the course of which neither had made much impression upon the other . In the years since then , apart from a common appraisal of the dangers of Nazism , their positions on most issues had been diametrically opposed . Churchill 's rigidly conservative , traditionalist ideology had nothing in common with the pragmatic experimentalism of Roosevelt , who was idolized by the American unions and the acknowledgedleader of American liberalism . With views on the New Deal indistinguishable from those of ex-President Hoover , who had remained aloof after the capsizing of laissez-faire capitalismand insisted that the wreck would right itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt 's " ruthless war onp192wealth and business , " while Roosevelt in turn had dismissed Churchill as a backward-looking , has-been politician . How , then , to explain this sudden gesture of sympathy and solidarity ? The answer lay in the grasp that both men shared of **26;14167;TOOLONG realities , which transcended domestic issues : they both understood the role of sea power as the vital instrument of world power , and the dependence of both nations  --  indeed , of the entire Western democratic world  --  on joint AngloAmericannaval supremacy . Roosevelt , following the doctrines of the American strategist and naval historian Admiral Mahan , whose writings he had devouredin his youth , recognized naval power as the key to America'sfuture defense , and more importantly , recognized the need to develop a policy of cooperation , not competition , with the Royal Navy in order to counterbalance the rise of Germany and Japan . Steam and electricity had shrunk America 's oceanic moat and made her part of a single cultural and ideological heritage that stretched from the Hawaiian Islands to the Rhine . American interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's maneuverings for a power-balance in Europe did on American reinsurance in the western hemisphere . They faced common adversaries back-to-back , and shared naval strength was essential to protect both their rears . The British had recognized this convergence of interests , too , which was the main reason for their benevolent neutrality during the Spanish-American War , and their quiet encouragementof the U.S. annexations of Hawaii and the Philippines beforeGermany could annex them . It also explained Britain 's concessions in the Alaskan boundary dispute and to the Americaninsistence on control of Panama . America , for her part , had reciprocated massively with her entry into the Great War in 1917 . America could n't afford to let Britain and France go down . Despite lofty phrases about keeping the world safe for democracy , the simple fact was that to save her own hide , America would have to halt the have-not nations in their drive to loot the haves , and the Maginot Line was her first line of defense . It had been true in 1917 , and it was true now . Roosevelt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his and Churchill 's having occupied similar positions during the Great War . Then he had gone on to use the telling phrase that the current situation was " essentially similar . " The letter , in languagethat another global strategist would understand , had signaledtheir unity of viewpoint and purpose . How he wished there were more people in Congress withp193similarly broad conceptual horizons , Roosevelt thought as he sat back from his desk in the room he had made his " oval study . " He watched Secretary of State Cordell Hull and adviser Harold Ickes depart with the three senators they had been talking with about the 1935 Neutrality Act that he wished he 'd never signed ; a vote on easing the restrictions against shipping arms to belligerents would take place at the end of the month  --  October . He preferred working here to his official office in the ExecutiveWing . It was a comfortable room , with dark green curtains , white walls , chintz covered furniture , and he had given it a personal touch with dozens of personal knickknacks , family mementos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and selected treasures from his collecton of naval charts and pictures . The desk had been a present from Queen Victoria . It was made from the timbers of a British ship abandoned after becoming trapped on northern ice ; the ship had subsequently been saved by American whalers , and restored and returned to Britain by the U.S. government . Roosevelt , in his fifty-seventh year , President since 1932 , had thinning hair starting to turn gray , a broad smile that came readilyand showed his teeth , and wore gold-rimmed pince-nez on a large , straight nose that suited his rugged , square-jawed head . He was naturally big in stature and had developed massive arms and shoulders after a polio attack eighteen years previously , which had left him with both legs paralyzed and would have ended the careers of many lesser men . He , however , had bounced back into the political arena to become Governor of New York State , and then President at a time when the nation 's distressed condition had presented government with perhaps its greatest challenge . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have had to say from the comparativeshelter of later years about the real efficacy of his measures , the sheer dynamism of his " First Hundred Days " had been enough to inspire the people that the strength of Uncle Sam was committed on their side . The plunging indicators of prosperity and confidence had leveled out and then begun rising again in the succeeding years , and his reelection in 1936 had been a landslide of popular endorsement . His second term , however , perhaps predictably , was proving to be a rougher ride . In his own words , he and his New Dealers had " earned the hatred of entrenched greed . " With the worst of the Depression behind them , the forces of the far right were now pouring out of their trenches to attack those who had dented their self-esteem by exposing their pretensions to knowledge that the public had once taken for wisdom . On another flank , hisp194move to alter the structure of the judicial branch  --  in effect , to liberalize it after a number of Supreme Court rulings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be miscalculatedand had failed . The experience had demonstrated that , irrespective of his continued personal popularity , there were certainprinciples and institutions that the American people cherishedabove individuals , and which they were innately suspicious of any attempts to meddle with . In this category was their determination , having disentangledthemselves from the Old World and its problems , to stay disentangled , and not to involve their sons in the very squabbles that they themselves had come halfway around the world to escape . The solid isolationist phalanxes of Congress reflected this mood , and if Roosevelt believed privately that America would have to enter the war sooner or later , clearly he would have to tread carefully in any attempt to reshape the nation 's perceptions . Until quite recently , he had n't been at all sure that he wanted to make any such effort . Munich and the events after it had filled him with a sense of hopelessness and despair , and by the summer of 1939 he had practically resigned himself to the thought of retiring from public life to enjoy his family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But **26;14195;TOOLONG firmness over Poland , which Roosevelt had n't expected , had given him new heart ; and then the appointmentof Churchill first to the War Cabinet and then to the Admiraltyhad rekindled all his old hopes . His letter to Churchill had also been partly an expression of the jubilation he had been unable to contain . In fact , the sudden turn of events had been so invigorating that he was even entertaining thoughts of flouting convention and running for a third presidential term . It was only a thought . He had n't mentioned it to anyone yet , not even Eleanor . In the meantime , however , there was the next meeting to think about . While Pa Watson , his appointments secretary , was marshaling the next group of visitors in the corridor outside , Roosevelt drew the top folder of his stack across the desk and opened it to quickly refresh his memory . Oh , yes , it was a follow-up to the meeting that Alexander Sachs had finally obtained on October 11 , after a two-month wait , to hand-deliver the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much free time could anyone expect a President to have when the fuse to the global powder keg had just burned down ? Roosevelt turned over the sheets in the dossier and scanned the underlined sections and the marginal notes he hadp195made . Uranium research at Columbia . . . possible source of enormous energy . . . single bomb might destroy a city . . . Nazi program ? Also present besides himself , Sachs , and Watson had been two ordnance specialists , Colonel Adamson from the Army and Commander Hoover from the Navy . " Not a relative ! " Watson had penned jokingly by the latter name in his briefing notes . Roosevelt smiled . The transcript of the October 11 minutes showed the meeting ending with Roosevelt 's words , " Pa , this requiresaction . " The action had taken the form of appointing an Advisory Committee on Uranium , to be chaired by the Director of the National Bureau of Standards , Lyman J. Briggs . The committee had scheduled its first meeting to take place at the Bureau on October 21 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given as being involved in the work . But then something unusual had occurred . Leo Szilard had contacted Watson to insist that a group representing the scientistsbe granted access to the President before that date . Demandedas absolutely imperative . Fixed for Oct. 16 . Roosevelt 's eyebrows rose as he read Watson 's note of the conversation . " Demanded , huh ? " he murmured to himself . " Boy , this had better be good . " Then he set the file aside and looked up as the five visitors filed into the room . Roosevelt already knew Einstein . The professor and his secondwife , Elsa , deceased three years now , had stayed as overnight guests at the White House early in 1934 after moving from Europe ; they had actually arrived in 1933 , but there had been a mixupwith the first invitation . Roosevelt spoke German well , and he and Einstein had found much to talk about concerning the darkening European scene and their common love of sailing . Szilard , the Hungarian scientist referred to in Einstein 's letter , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being tracked down by Watson at short notice . The other two names , however , were unfamiliar : Professor Mortimer Greene , and a German , Dr. Kurt Scholder . Roosevelt sat back and beamed when the introductory formalitieshad been completed . " Okay , " he invited . " Shoot . " Szilard , uncharacteristically nervous from his sense of the gravity of the occasion , sat forward on the edge of his chair . " Mr. President , thank you for agreeing to my most irregular request , " he began . " I 'm sure that when you have listened to us , you will agree there was good reason for it . I 'll come straight to the point .. " Please do , " Watson interjected . " We 've had to make time by squeezing you in. "  |p196Szilard  nodded . " The fact is , " he continued , " that what we have to say has nothing to do with uranium research , although that , too , is an important subject . The real matter that brings us here is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . " Adamson and Watson frowned . Roosevelt 's chin tilted upward a fraction , the movement alone doing all the asking that was necessary . " If I may . " Mortimer Greene reached inside his jacket and took out an envelope , from which he drew a photograph . He halfroseto give the picture to Watson , who passed it to the President . It was an enlargement of a photograph in a document from the microfilm library that the team had brought with them from 1975 . Roosevelt 's brow creased as he stared at the picture . Then his expression changed from puzzlement to baffled incredulity as the impossible implication of what he was looking at sank in . He looked up , and his mouth started to open . " Oh yes , it 's quite genuine , I assure you , " Szilard said . " Be thankful , perhaps , that happen every day , something like this does not , " Einstein offered , trying to be helpful . Roosevelt blinked and looked down at the photograph again . It showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated tree , with smiling people , children dressed in their Sunday best , and lots of packages and wrappings lying around . The family was his , and the place was clearly their mansion at Hyde Park , by the Hudson , halfway between Albany and New York . He himself was standing in the center with Eleanor ; three of their sons  --  John , James , and Franklin D. , Jr .  --  were there , with daughter Anna Eleanor ; and there were in-laws , grandchildren , and other relatives that he could identify immediately . The problem was that he could n't remember a Christmas on which this particular picture could have been taken . For one thing , there was a female cousin sitting with a baby on her knee that seemed to be hers , yet she had never had one and had only recently announced her engagement . And even more perplexing was the note scribbled across the lower right-hand corner in what was unmistakably his own handwriting . It read : To Catherine &; Johnwith happy memories to relieve these trying **27;14223;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully on the papers before him , stared at it for a few seconds longer , then took a cigarette from the box to one side and inserted it into his holder . " I think you people had better explain , " he said at last , looking up . The decision finally arrived at , as Winslade had hoped , was to try all-out for a working return-gate as first priority , which would automatically give them the bomb  --  from 1975  --  if they succeeded . A lower-priority program of ongoing atomic research would be maintained in the meantime as insurance in case they did n't succeed . This arrangement had the added attraction that the second area of activity could continue to provide a convenientcover for the first . The other thing Roosevelt ordered was that the remainder of the Proteus team be brought to Washington . " I want to meet every one of this bunch , " he told Watson . " And besides , every U.S. citizen ought to be able to talk to his President . What difference does it make which copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He thought for a moment and then looked at Greene . " How long did you say they 've been cooped up in that warehouse in Brooklyn ? " " Since February , " Greene replied . " Did the soldiers there bring uniforms back with them from 1975 ? " " Yes , as a matter of fact they did . " " Well , you can tell them that I want them to wear their uniformswhen they come here , " Roosevelt said . " It 'll be good for their pride and morale . " He made an empty-handed gesture at Watson . " Things would have taken a pretty bad turn if soldiers of the United States Army had to creep around in disguise to meet their own Commander-in-Chief , would n't t h e y , Pa ... and at the White House of all places ? If anyone gets inquisitive , they can just say that the subject 's classified and they 're not permitted to talk about it . " The meeting at the Bureau of Standards that had been fixed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , an appropriation of $6,000 was approved to commence the U.S. nuclearweapons program . The transcript of the proceedings depictedAdamson as a closed-minded officer of the old school , unwilling to consider new possibilities . At one point , he was recordedas asserting that moral superiority , not gimmicks in weaponry , brought victory . If that were so , Eugene Wigner re/torted , the Army 's budget could be cut by thirty percent . Edward Teller concluded that Hitler 's " moral superiority " had just smashed the Poles . But that was , after all , only for the official record.  |p199IN  THE HISTORY OF the Proteus team 's world , Hitler had delivered a major speech to the Reichstag on October 6 , 1939 , proclaiming his desire for peace . He had done no more than correct the injusticesinflicted upon Germany at Versailles , he maintained , and he offered to settle the few remaining differences between Germanyand the West at a conference . The West 's leaders , however , unable to back down in the glare of world opinion , but at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This had led Hitler to conclude that they needed a stronger justification if they were to disentangle themselves from the war . The Russians , sensing what was coming and anxious to improvetheir security , had begun pressuring Finland for border readjustments after seizing eastern Poland , and eventually opened hostilities against Finland at the end of November . With Russia thus preoccupied for the time being , Hitler ordered preparations for an attack into France through Belgium and Holland . Bad weather caused several postponements , but the blitzkrieg finallyrolled westward on January 30 , 1940 . The French , already demoralized internally and faced with three Fascist dictators  --  Hitler , Mussolini , and Franco  --  on their borders , sued for an armisticewithout any great show of resistance . The screen before the gathering of people in a darkened roomp200of Churchill 's flat in Morpeth Mansions showed newsreel extractsof German tank columns passing through French villages , artillery batteries in action , and thousands of bedraggled Allied prisoners being marched along roads by grinning Wehrmacht guards . Arthur Bannering 's voice continued its commentary above the whirring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition that France be partitioned into a German-occupied sector and a sector under a pro-German regime that would also administer the French colonies . The French accepted , leaving the British Expeditionary Force across the Channel in an impossible situation . It , too , was forced to surrender in March . " " They could n't have been evacuated ? " Churchill queried from where he was sitting in the center at the front , facing the screen . " Everything had been half-hearted , " Bannering replied . " Nobodyhad expected an attack of such ferocity . The Army was n't equipped to fight a real war , never mind to stage an evacuation . " " Hmph , " Churchill grunted . Churchill had moved into quarters above the War Room at Admiralty House , which besides keeping him close to his official duties , freed his own flat at Pimlico for use as an operations centerfor the Proteus team . Professor Lindemann , who was sitting by the fireplace , had also moved into Admiralty House , ostensiblyto set up a statistics department for aiding the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1939 , and the trusted inner circle that knew about Proteus had grown somewhat since the outbreak of war . The film showed German soldiers demolishing the wall of a museum building and then moving a railroad coach outside . Banneringcontinued , " The French surrender was formally signed in April , in the same railway carriage that Marshal Foch used to dictate the surrender terms to Germany that ended the Great War . It was moved for the occasion to the same spot in the woods at Compiegne that it had occupied on November 11 , 1918 . " Scenes of the surrender formalities followed , and then the view changed to one of German troops embarking and their ships putting to sea . " In May , Hitler 's forces invaded Denmark and Norway . The British position was hopeless  --  the Norwegian ports would enable the Germans to tighten the U-boat blockade ; we had no allies ; and all of our equipment , along with most of the Air Force , had been lost in France . With the end in sight , Mussolini entered the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty terms forbidding it , Hitler seized the French Fleet at Oran , which in combination with the Italiansp201gave the Axis the Mediterranean . We had no choice but to withdrawthe Navy to Gibraltar , leaving Egypt exposed . " Bannering 's voice took on a bleak note as he relived the anguishof years that were both long gone and imminent . " After that , the rest of Europe fell in with what was obviously the winningside , and we were soon overwhelmed . Spain opened its borders , enabling Hitler to take Gibraltar . Malta fell . The Balkan states aligned with the Axis to form a second strategic pincer closing on the Persian Gulf through Greece and Turkey , in addition to the Italian offensive across North Africa . " In November , Halifax , who had replaced Chamberlain as Prime Minister , sought a truce by offering to give up Egypt . But Hitler was unimpressed , since the collapse of the whole Middle East was now unavoidable , anyway . Seeing a chance to eliminate a possible base for future American operations , Hitler demanded occupation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed formations of massed Luftwaffe bombers , and then changed to more by-now-familiar shots of explosions , fires , and falling buildings . This time , however , the scenes were of London streets and landmarks . Gasps of protest came from some of the viewers . Bannering concluded somberly , " The remnants of the RAF were destroyed in the first three weeks . We were defenseless . Nothing was left to oppose the air bombardment or the invasion forces massing in the ports across the Channel . The Royal Family and other prominent figureswere taken to Canada , and German troops began landing in England , unopposed , on the last day of the year . The British surrenderwas signed on January 1 , 1941 . " The final sequence showed Hitler driving triumphantly through London at the head of a victory parade , along streets lined with panzer tanks and gray-coated German soldiers . Winslade switched off the projector . Over by the door , BrendanBracken , a close friend and aide of Churchill 's , turned on the lights . Heavy silence lasted a few seconds while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out all around the room . Admiral Pound , the First Sea Lord and a former naval colleague of Churchill 's , looked across at Bannering . " So was that when you got out , Arthur  --  with those people right at the end ? " Bannering shook his head . " I went a couple of months earlier with one of the departments that had been relocated to Canada in October . " Desmond Morton , another of Churchill 's close acquaintancessince the Great War days , stroked his chin thoughtfully.  |p202He  was a former artillery officer who had added to his Military Cross the distinction of being shot through the heart and living normally ever since with a bullet in him . " Then that would mean there 's a . . . copy , or whatever , of you , walking around somewhere in London at this very moment , would n't it ? " " Yes , " Lindemann tossed in . ' As a matter of fact , he 's been hoping to catch a glimpse of himself ever since January . " " Extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to his feet while the screen was being retracted out of the way of a large map of the world affixed to the wall . He turned to face the room and raised a hand . Silence fell quickly . Winslade came forward to sit down in the chair that he had occupied earlier . " Now you have seen the rocks of disaster to which our course of only a few months ago was leading , " Churchill said . " But let no one suppose that we now know how to avoid the worst . On the contrary , the situation here seems to be , if anything , even worse than that which existed without our meddling . We are at war with greater determination , certainly , but against that our prospects for success have surely weakened since Russia has been converted from cynical neutralityto active alliance with Hitler . " Nobody could be sure how much of what had changed in this world was really a result of the team 's actions , and how much of it would have happened , anyway . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their actions to seemingly disconnected , faraway events were astonishing . Churchill continued , " Corporal Hitler 's October 6 Peace Speech to the Reichstag , we are told , took place in both worlds . The version we heard in this world , however , blamed me specificallyfor the war . Since my counterpart held no office in the Proteusworld , it is clear that our actions are already altering the behavior of the Nazi leaders in Berlin . " Furthermore , as we know , Chamberlain and Daladier are staunchly refusing even to consider a conference while German armies stand on ground that they have seized by force ; in the previous world they were too paralyzed by the rush of events to reply . This difference , too , can be attributed to the Proteus opera-tion . " Churchill spread his hands appealingly . " On the other hand we have the deplorable incident of the Royal Oak . " In the middle of October , a German submarine had penetrated the defenses of the British Fleet 's home base at Scapa Flow , off the north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That did not happen in the previous world . As head of the Admiralty , I can assure you we would have been better prepared if it had . It 's diffi/cult to see how anything that we have done could possibly have brought about that change . " But what are we to make of the recent vote by the U.S. Congress to repeal the arms embargo section of the Neutrality Act ? " Churchill asked . This decision allowed American arms and munitions to be sold to belligerents as long as they were paid for in cash and transported in the buyer 's own ships , which favoredthe Allies because of Britain 's naval strength . " Was this no more than a whim of a different timeline ? Or was President Roosevelt , who became disillusioned in the previous world , sufficientlyinspired by our last-minute resoluteness to step up his pressure on Congress ? If so , then again we can take credit for bringing about the difference . " In short , how reliable a guide are the major events in that previous world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are searching feverishly for a pattern . " He paused and surveyed the room for a moment before concluding . " If German planning has followed the same course as before , we know that the blitzkrieg in the West has already been ordered . Only the foibles of the weather are causing its postponement . Previously the attack came finally at the end of January , but with all the uncertainties , who can say if that will be the case again ? It could come tomorrow . " Churchill raised an arm and extended his index finger for emphasis . " But nevertheless , we dare not risk making this knowledge generally available within the government . If word were to find its way back to Hitler and his masters that they no longer have a monopoly on this extraordinary time-technology , we have to assume they would try for an immediate victory by introducing atomic weapons now , instead of waiting until 1942 . Thus , everything depends on the scientists in America . We over here can only hold firm and await results with hope . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room remainedquiet . Churchill nodded to Winslade to take it from there and sat down . Winslade rose , rubbed his hands together for a few seconds while he stood looking at the map , and then turned to face the room . " But that is n't to say that we ca n't take advantage of our foreknowledge to reap some benefit , " he said briskly . An immediatestir greeted the statement . This was what everyone had been waiting to hear . " Let 's be honest with ourselves and admit that in view of the security precautions that we 've all agreed are essential , we 're not going to see any fundamental alteration in governmentpolicy in the next two months . We assume , therefore , that the blow upon Belgium will tall late in January , as before . Wep204hope , however , that because of what people like Winston have been doing , the French will hold out better this time . " Winslade paused , but no one spoke . He turned to gaze at the map again , and then ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence , this area , remote from all the action , should be very quiet . Now , while we as a group may not control the country , we do pretty much have the Navy  --  the First Lord and First Sea Lord are sitting right here . " The plan we have worked out is this  --  to take advantage of the attention being focused on the Western Front during these spring months by using the Navy to put ashore a landing force here , in northern Norway . Publicly , the justification will be to aid Finland through Sweden . In our world , the Finns surprised everybodyby giving the Russians a bloody nose , and there was a lot of popular support and sympathy for them . We see no reason to expectanything different in this world . The government , however , will believe that the purpose of the operation will be to cut Hitler 's iron-ore supply line from the Swedish mines here at Gallivare , and down here through the port of Narvik . " Winslade smiled crookedly for a second . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Norway , which we know will take place in May . Hence , we can deny Hitler not only his iron ore , but also the additional U-boat bases that he 's planning to seize on the Atlantic seaboard . " There was a short silence while the listeners digested the proposition . Then somebody asked , " How sure can we be that the Germans will stick to May ? " " Nothing 's certain , " Winslade conceded . " But so far at least , the timeline differences that we 've observed seem to be in details rather than in anything substantial . Events should tell us if that principle is continuing to hold . According to our experience , for example , the Russian attack on Finland should begin two days from now . Whether or not that happens again will be a good test . " " How well-prepared are we to mount an expedition like that  --  in training and equipment , I mean ? " Desmond Morton asked doubtfully . " Let 's not forget how much of a start the Germanshave got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Major Warren . Warren answered from a chair by the door , near Eden and Duff Cooper . " Not so well-prepared as we 'd like , " he admitted candidly . " The biggest thing that the people I 've talked to do n't comprehend yet is the power of planes against ships . If the Luftwaffemanages to get bases within effective range of the operation , we 're in trouble . Carriers ca n't compete with land-basedp205aircraft , and the British Navy does n't have enough carriers , anyway . Forget battleships . They 've had their day . " " But the Luftwaffe wo n't be anywhere near because they 'll be preoccupied in France , " Churchill said . And if the German Navy tries to intervene , well. , we know how to take care of them . " Laughter came from one or two places , somebody raised a query , and the discussion turned into a technical debate on the relative merits of land- and carrier-based aircraft and battleships . Warren caught Winslade 's eye and held it for a moment . Winslade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , which only the original , inner core of people knew about . Hitler 's return-gate to 2025 was located near Leipzig , in the eastern part of Germany , just under a hundred miles south of Berlin . It was contained in a rock-hewn cavern deep beneath a chemicals and munitions manufacturing complex at a place called Weissenberg . There could be no hope of defending the West effectively while it continued to exist . And since there was still no news of a connection back to 1975 , Winslade had decided on his own initiative to do something about getting rid of it . " We were supposed to be just sappers sent ahead to build the bridge for getting the tanks across , " he had told Churchill . " But it does n't look as if the tanks will be coming . Therefore , I propose that we attack the target ourselves , without any further waiting . Eliminating that machine must be our overriding priority . " Eliminating it would be the goal of operation Ampersand , " tiny in scale but immeasurably great in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other events in Europe were drawing attention elsewhere . Having provisionally agreed on the outline of a plan , the group waited to see if Russia would confirm Winslade 's predictionby attacking Finland , as she had in the previous world . She did , right on schedule , on November 30 . Encouraged that their information was continuing to prove reliable in its essentials , Winslade sent a message to New York , readying the rest of the mission 's military contingent for an immediate move to England.  |p206COLONEL  HANS PIEKENBROCK , CHIEF of the Abwehr 's secret intelligence and espionage section , stared dubiously at the file lying open on his desk . He reached across the desk and took the glossy pages from an American illustrated news magazine that Lt. Col. Boeckel was proffering from the other side . And this is the picture ? " he murmured as he examined the color photograph on the top sheet . It showed two men shaking hands in a spacious , elegantly furnished setting , while several others looked on from behind . The scene was of representatives from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the entrance hall of the White House after talks following the October conference of American nations . Piekenbrock was interested not in the foreground figures , however , but in the small group of uniformed soldiers behind them that the cameraman had inadvertently captured , just inside the edge of the frame . They were standing in a loose huddle , possibly waiting their turn for an appointment . A couple of men in civilianclothes were with them , also . Boeckel passed across an enlargement of part of the picture , which the Photographic Department had produced at his request . " If I may , sir . . . " He indicated two of the soldiers , who were standing together on one side  --  one tall , with a yellow mus/tache , caught in the act of waving a hand as he said something ; and the other , darker . " Fritsch sent us the article because he says he 's certain that those two were among the gang he described in his earlier report . " Boeckel picked up a further enlargement , showing very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignia on the tunics . " I did a routine check to identify the unit they 're from , but the result was puzzling . There 's no record of those designations in any of the U.S. Army manuals . And if you look carefully at the uniforms themselves , you 'll notice that they differ from the standard American pattern in a number of subtle ways . Again , we have no record of anything quite like them . " Piekenbrock sat back in his chair , his fingers steepled below his chin . Then he got up and walked over to the window to stare down at the traffic on Bendlerstrasse . " Let 's run through this very quickly once again , " Piekenbrock said at last . " First of all , this man Fritsch gets himself mixed up with American gangsters somehow and ends up at this house outside New York . But these mysterious men in masks , who walk up walls and put hoodlums in the hospital with their bare hands , appear from nowhere , seize the whole place , and hand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a rival gang , anyway . " " Whatever . And Fritsch sends you a report of this affair , includingan account from the New York newspapers . " At the time , it seemed to have nothing to do with anything except American criminals , " Boeckel said . " But we kept the matterunder review , nevertheless . " Piekenbrock held up a hand . " You did the right thing . Anyway , it now turns out that these men are not criminals , but American soldiers . Also , they belong to a hitherto unknown unit , which might conceivably just have been formed . They appearto have undergone some extraordinary training . And now they show up at the White House . . . to meet whom ? Could it be the President himself , perhaps ? If so , why ? Who are they ? " " I have been giving the matter some thought , " Boeckel said . And have you come up with any ideas ? " " Well , it 's merely a speculation , you understand , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been developing a secret unit to specialize in undercover urban activities  --  sabotage , assassination , or other such missons . The raid on the gangster 's house could have been a practice exercise with the added benefit of having some redeeming social value  --  perhaps by eliminating some criminal elements that the authorities could n't touch legally " Piekenbrock raised his eyebrows . " You mean the police did n't know ? Would n't that he a hit risky ? "  | " Not as risky as the real thing and someone else 's police , " Boeckel pointed out . " It would be the ultimate in training real-ism . " " Hm , yes  --  ingenious , I 'll grant you that . Go on . " Boeckel tapped the file lying on the desk . " The warehouse that Fritsch identified in Brooklyn could be their camouflaged operations base . What I suspect is that they 've been running an elaborate exercise to see if they can remain invisible for a protractedperiod in a major city while merging with the criminal fraternity and carrying out active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even any official knowledge that they exist . Having tested their methods , a visit to Washingtoncould represent their ' graduation , ' as it were , before becomingoperational elsewhere . " " Such as ? " Boeckel shrugged . " Well , we all know that Roosevelt would like to get into the war , but Congress and the people wo n't let him , openly . A good guess might be that they 're being sent over here  --  maybe even to Berlin . " And assassination , you said , might be among their spe-cialties ? " Boeckel drew a long breath . " With some obvious names as targets . " Piekenbrock nodded . Clearly , his own thinking had already led him to the same conclusion . " That could also explain why Roosevelt should be involved personally , " he mused . " Exactly , sir . " " Hmm . . . I think we should find out more about this warehouseif we can , " Piekenbrock said . " Not Fritsch  --  he 's just an amateur . Reads too many boys ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto it  --  someone like Musketeer . But I do n't want anyone breaking in or doing anything reckless if they 're likely to bump into the kind of people that Fritsch described . That will be all . " " Yes , sir . " Boeckel stood up and gathered the file and papers together . " I just want to know a bit more about the place , some idea of what goes in and out , " Piekenbrock said . " Low-key  --  know what I mean ? " " I 'll start on it right away . " " Very good . Oh , and Boeckel  --  about that secretary of yours . She 's an attractive woman . It 's not a good idea to flaunt it so much when Lady Luck smiles your way , you know . I 'm hearing jealous noises from several directions . I know the Fiihrer wants us to make more Germans , but he never said anything aboutp209making a public spectacle of doing so . I trust I make myself clear ? " " Oh , yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Very good . I 'll say no more . Good day . Heil Hitler . " " Heil Hitler . "  |p210FERRACINI  'S UNCLE FRANK HAD brought him here once as a young boy to see the place where he had been born . And from time to time as he grew older , when Ferracini felt sad or lonely , he had come back to this part of Queens to walk the streets that had made up the world of the parents he had never known , as if sharingthe memories of the sights and scenes they had lived among somehow brought him closer to them . The building that he remembered as derelict and boarded-up on the corner of a dingy street now had bright red curtains and flowerpots in the upper windows , and a bicycle shop was open for business on the ground floor . What he had known as an autopartsdealer 's next door , with a sparse assortment of gaskets , fan belts , cans , and tools clipped to a pegboard behind its dusty window , was a busy delicatessen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the hardware store was still a hardware store , although it looked more old-fashioned , with tin bathtubs hanging over the doorway , drums of kerosene and turpentine inside , and a bench out on the sidewalk stacked with bundles of firewood , candles , balls of twine , and all kinds of brushes . What had been a TV store was now selling vegetables , and the gap where a burned-out shell had stood was a house with green painted woodworkand children 's drawings chalked on the wall by the door.  |p211The  street as a whole , though recognizable and not without its scars , had a different feeling from the tired drabness of the scene he remembered from long ago and yet to come , in another world . It felt alive and colorful , as he had pictured it in his daydreams ; the way he would have liked it to be . Ferracini thrust his hands deep into his overcoat pockets and walked slowly past the houses and shops ; the church standing behind trees inside walled grounds ; the school at the bottom of the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his older brothers and sister had grown up in before he was born . He was n't exactly sure why he had come back again now ; he had never thought of himself as sentimental . Orders had come through from Winslade for the Special Operationsforce to be ready to move to England . A detachment of plainclothes U.S. Military Police would be taking over security at Gatehouse . This was just something that Ferracini had felt he had to do before they left . Just curiosity , he 'd told himself , not nostalgia . It was Janet 's day off ; she 'd wanted to come with him , but he had said no . It was something he 'd wanted to do alone . He would go back to the flat afterward and say good-by to her and Jeff . He stood for a long time on a corner , staring at his parents ' house from a short distance along the opposite side of the street . It had become run-down by the time Frank had first pointed it out , and Ferracini remembered feeling disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with freshly painted woodwork , bright curtains , and its small front yard neat and trim . A light drizzle began falling . Ferracini turned up his collar , but remainedstanding on the corner , his mind filled with memories of the stories his aunt and uncle had told him of times gone by , and of the photographs in the albums that he had pored over as a boy . As soon as he saw the woman in the dark coat appear around the corner at the end of the street , he knew why he had been waiting . It was his mother . The dark-haired girl walking beside her and gripping her sleeve would be his sister , Angela , who had been four in 1939 . He watched as they came nearer on the far side of the street , his mother small , frail , and hunched slightly with the weight of the shopping bag that she was carrying , and Angela chattering and skipping a step or two in every few They arrived at the house , entered the front yard , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment to glance curiously at the bareheaded , tousle-haired young man in the overcoat , watchingfrom the corner . For a fraction of a second , the distance seemed to telescope , as had the time , and he felt as if he were looking deep into the face that he had seen only in pictures  --  ap212brave and determined face , yet at the same time gentle as only a mother 's can be , lined by a lifetime of struggle and sacrifices that had deserved better reward . Then she turned away and disappeared into the house . After a while , Ferracini began walking slowly back the way he had come . It was n't a tear on his face , he told himself . The rain was getting heavier . He had only come out of curiosity , after all . Early the next day , in a chemistry laboratory at Columbia , Jeff was crouched down before one of the cupboards beneath the workbench , holding a list of apparatus required for the morning 's experiment in one hand , and lifting out tripod , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other . As he was finishing , a foot planted itself in his field of vision , and a tall , thinnish figure with glasses materialized above . " Did you bring it ? " Asimov asked . Jeff closed the cupboard door and stood up . " Bring what ? " he asked , at the same time feeling a pang of guilt as he remembered . Harry had showed up at the apartment the evening before to announcethat he was leaving for an indefinite period ; after his earlieradmission to Janet that he would be going overseas , the mystery and excitement had driven all thought of Asimov 's story from Jeff 's mind . " The draft you said you 'd read over , " Asimov replied . " The story about the spaceship trapped in the gravity field that ca n't communicate out because its frequencies are shifted . You promisedyou 'd let me have it back today . " " Oh . . . oh , yes . " Jeff reached for his bag on the stool behind him and pulled out folders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rummaging through them , he had already rememberedwith a sinking feeling that the manuscript had been lying near some things of Harry 's that Harry had scooped togetherand taken with him the night before . He was pretty sure , too , that it had no longer been there after Harry had gone . " I . . . I must have left it at home , " he mumbled . There was always a chance that Janet might have set it aside somewhere . Asimov 's face dropped . " Hell and dammit , Jeff ! I wanted it tonight to work in a couple of new changes I 've thought of , " he grumbled irritably . " Sorry , Isaac , it slipped my mind . I 'll look for it tonight . " " Look for it ? " Asimov blanched . " My God ! You do n't mean you 've lost it ? " " No , of course not . " " Okay , well , try and let me have it tomorrow , will you , Jeff ? " " Tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five outgoing members of the Proteus militarycontingent  --  Ferracini , Cassidy , Payne , Ryan , and Lamson  --  were assembling with their personal kit in the mess area at Gatehouse . The other baggage and equipment for England had already been sent ahead by ship to Liverpool , in two duplicate shipments because of the U-boat hazard . They themselves , followingconfidential arrangements made between Roosevelt 's and Churchill 's staffs , would be flown to England in a converted U.S. Army bomber ; for official records , the bomber would be making a test flight to evaluate transatlantic delivery routes for longrangemilitary aircraft . As to what was supposed to happen after that , all they knew was that they would undergo some kind of training and then proceed to active operations " somewhere over-seas . " " We 'll go in by sub , " Cassidy told the others as they collected their things in final preparation to move out . " Wait and see  --  straight into the Baltic . Five dollars says it 's by sub . " " They would n't risk it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baltic . The German defenses would be on alert all the time . " " Where else , then ? " " Up from the south  --  Mediterranean , through Italy , " Ryan said . " Why else d' ya think they brought Harry along ? He looks the part , see . " Cassidy looked at Lamson . ' Any guesses , Floyd ? " Lamson shrugged and heaved a backpack onto his shoulder . " Who cares ? Guessing is n't gon na change anything . It could be an air drop . " Mortimer Greene and Kurt Scholder were waiting to escort them to the front of the building . The two FBI agents who would he accompanying the party to Mitchell Field on Long Island came forward to help with the bags . After a last look around at what had become , since January , a home in many ways , they filed through the doorway in the partition that separated off the machine area . Some of the scientists were working as usual . Einstein was puffing his pipe and listening to Fermi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an immense brow formed by his recedinghairline , who was gesticulating excitedly as he talked . Szilard was busy at one of the consoles , and Teller had been around fifteen minutes or so earlier . In addition , partly to make up for the loss in technical assistance that the departure of the troops would entail , more technicians and scientists had been recruited to the group.  |p214Einstein  and Fermi stopped talking and came to say their farewells . Szilard got up from his console and joined them . " So the time has come , yes ? " Einstein said . " What should one say on an occasion such as this ? To each of you , may your own kind of God , whatever that might be , go with you . And to anyone that does n't have one , well , you might find one that suits you . But whatever , good luck , my boys . " " Good luck , " Szilard repeated as lots of hands were being shaken in turn . " Let 's hope that we manage something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not good-by , but arrivederci , " Fermi said . " I 'm sure you will all be back again sometime , when the Fascists are no more . Before then , too , all of America will be fighting with you . You will see . " Teller reappeared just in time to add his own good wishes , and then the group walked through the front area of the warehouseto the loading bay where another guard was waiting in the bus . As the bus passed the Brooklyn Bridge , Ferracini stared across the river at the familiar skyline and thought of all the things he had found that he had never imagined existed , and which would now have to be left behind . Always in his life it had been the same . Perhaps , he brooded inwardly , some things were better left undiscovered . Back at Gatehouse , Einstein came through from the machineinto the mess area and ambled over to the side-table where the coffeepot and tea urn stood . " Enough work for one morning . Now I will relax a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had returned from the front of the building and were talking over cups of coffee at the large table , nodded to acknowledge his presence . The place seemed strangely quiet and empty with none of the troops around . Einstein poured himself a cup of tea from the urn , stirred in a spoonful of sugar , and sat down in an armchairnearby to refill his pipe . More voices sounded from the other side of the partition . A moment later the door opened again , and Szilard came through with Fermi and Teller . Szilard , as usual , was doing the talking . " In each element of the superposition , the object-system assumesa particular eigenstate of the observer . What 's more , every observer-system state describes the observer as perceiving that particular system state .... " Einstein sighed and looked around while he sipped his tea . His eyes roamed over the mess of oddments and litter that the troops had discarded in the last stages of packing and eventually came to rest on an overflowing trash bin standing near his chair . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Einstein lifted itp215from the bin and set it down on his knee to scan casually while he lit his pipe . " Ach so , der spaceship that goes to the stars , ja ? " he murmured to himself . He turned the page and settled himself back more comfortably , moving his feet to make room as Fermi came over to pour some coffee . " In each element , the system is left in an eigenstate of the measurement , " Fermi said over his shoulder . " If a redeterminationof the earlier observation is made at that stage , then every element of the resulting superposition will describe the observer with a memory configuration in which earlier impressions are consistent with later ones . That makes it inevitable that any observerwill perceive the system as ' jumping ' into an eigenstate randomly , and then remaining there for subsequent measurementson the system . " " Yes , I agree , " Teller said . " The main point , though , is that ... " In the chair , Einstein smiled delightedly and nodded his approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Yes , very good , very good . . . . Trapped in the intense gravity field , eh ? .. . Oh , is not so good .... " " Each memory sequence yields a distribution of possible values , " Szilard was saying . And each of the distributions may be subjected to statistical analysis . " " Yes , exactly ! " Fermi answered , waving his hands . " That 's my point . The conventional statistical interpretation must emerge from the formalism itself . Every observer must deduce that his universe obeys the familiar statistical quantum laws . The universal state vector becomes a tree , and every branch correspondsto a possible universe-as-we-see-it . " " Mein Gott ! " The exclamation from Einstein stopped the conversation dead . The others looked at him as he rose slowly to his feet with a strange look on his face , while the papers which he had been reading fluttered to the floor . " Are you all right ? " Szilard asked cautiously . Einstein did n't seem to hear . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the two ends did n't run at the same speed . . . . " he murmured distantly . Szilard looked at Teller , then at Fermi . They all shrugged . Scholder and Greene watched with puzzled expressions . " If you will excuse me , I must go back to my calculations and think some more , " Einstein said , still sounding faraway . He began movingtoward the door , at the same time nodding rapidly to himself . " Yes , suddenly a chink of light ... possibly , possibly , " they heard him mutter as he hurried out of view.  |p216THE  FLIGHT TO BRITAIN was uneventful . A chilly , misty December dawn was breaking when the plane finally landed at Prestwick , on the west coast of Scotland , where the five Americans were met by a Captain Portel and a Lieutenant Cox of the Royal Navy . The arrivals were tired and bleary-eyed , and after brief introductionseveryone climbed into a wagon to drive ten miles to Kilmarnock , where they would catch the London train coming from Glasgow . The conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wet , gray stone houses , the soggylookinghills in the background , and the cold , ungodly hour of the morning . The station cafeteria was just opening when they arrived , and they had time for a ham and cheese sandwich and a pint mug of strong , sweet , steaming tea , which quickly put life back into their cramped limbs and restored some color to their faces . A Christmas tree was standing in one corner near the stove . Opened on display in front of it was one of the hamper boxes , containing various items of food and candies , jars of chutney , pickles , and preserves , and knitted articles such as socks , mittens , and ear muffs , that the local branch of the Women 's VoluntaryService was sending to " The Boys at the Front . " As they stood around the stove warming themselves , Paynep217commented on the frivolities being reported in the American press . " All that the troops in France seem to be doing is digging holes and playing soccer for newsreel cameramen , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on over there to write about ? " " I suppose everyone 's relieved that all the things the experts were promising for years did n't happen , " Portel replied . " They told everyone the sky would be black with Heinkels and Dorniers , wingtip to wingtip , within hours . There were thousands of papier-mache coffins piled up ready , all the hospitals were standing by with acres of empty beds . . . and nothing happened . Now , of course , it 's all the government 's fault for not knowing anything about anything . But you ca n't blame poor old Neville for everything . He 's not a bad bloke really  --  does his best , you know . " With evacuations , the military call-up , and relocations of key personnel and government departments , about half the familiesin England had at least one member on the move somewhere , and the train down to London filled quickly until even the corridor was packed with baggage and people , with many khaki , navy , and RAF uniforms . A lot of troops got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party had found themselves a compartment . " They wo n't tell us how many lives the bloody blackout has cost , " Lieutenant Cox said . " But it 's cost a lot more than anythingthe Germans have done . Personally , I would n't be surprised if we end up patching things up with Hitler and calling the whole thing quits . I mean , if either side were serious , they 'd have done something about it by now , would n't they ? " Even the sinking of the Royal Oak had been " a pretty good show by Raeder 's chaps , " in Portel 's opinion . Ferracini was incredulousas he listened . It was all still a game of king-size cricket . A sporting , " Well hit , sir ! " had been earned by the other side . It did n't seem to have registered that what had been knocked for six was over eight hundred British sailors . But at least the British were doing something , he reflected . " What do people in America think ? " Cox asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , most of them have forgotten there 's a war on over here at all . " There were innumerable stops and delays , and it was dark when the train arrived at King 's Cross Station . They emerged , stumbling over curbstones and sandbags , into an eerie , black , treacherous world of unseen steps , corners , and lampposts , vaguely outlined buildings , and shuffling bodies . Pedestrians materializedsuddenly in the gloom , most of them carrying flashlightsand wearing at least one piece of white clothing , usually anp218armband , coat , hat , or scarf . In the roadway itself , drivers cautiouslyinched their way forward , guided only by thin pencils of light coming through slits cut in their headlight masks . Portel vanished into the murk to find a cab . How , Ferracini could n't imagine . " Man , oh man , I never realized Broadway was so beautiful , " Cassidy 's voice muttered from somewhere behind as they stood waiting . Portel evidently knew the ropes and reappeared after what seemed a miraculously short time with a taxicab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , to prove it had n't been a fluke , Portel repeated the performance by finding another cab for the rest . Twenty minutes later , they were all reunited at the KensingtonGarden Hotel near the Albert Hall . Rooms had already been booked , and Major Warren and Gordon Selby were waiting to welcome them . While the arrivals from New York went upstairs to clean up and change into fresh clothes , Portel and Cox went for a quick " noggin " in the bar with Warren and Selby ; then , their charges safely delivered , the two British officers departed . The others reassembled for a late dinner , which Warren had arranged to be served in a private room . " It 's a lot different here from Manhattan , " Gordon Selby said as they sat down . " I still have n't figured out how the cabbies find their way around at all . " " Does n't anyone talk about anything else but the blackout ? " Ryan asked . Selby grinned apologetically . " I must be picking up English habits already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so now they grumble  --  about the food rationing , about the Civil Defense peoplesitting at their posts and drinking tea with nothing to do all day , about the lousy benefits that the wives of the guys who are drafted get paid . . . . " He nodded . " But sure , mostly about the blackout . " " How about the trains  --  have you tried them yet ? " Cassidy said . " They 're really something . " " But in this England , we just walked on , " Lamson reminded him . " We did n't need any travel permits stamped by the local Polizeifiihrer . The Gestapo were n't on the train checking papers . That 's something , too . " " That 's a point , " Cassidy agreed . " The saddest part 's the big toy stores , " Selby said . " They 're all trying to keep up a business-as-usual face with lonely Santas sitting around among mountains of train sets and dolls , but there are n't any kids . They were all evacuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But they are starting to trickle back in again , especially with the time of year , " Warren added . One lump of sugar for the coffee was allowed per cup . Each person received one pat of butter and one of margarine for the rolls , and the waiter pointed out which was which . Ferracini turned his head to scan the room after the waiter had left . " Is this place safe to talk ? " he asked . Warren nodded . " It 's okay . We checked it before you guys ar-rived . " " Then about the mission  --  what happens next ? " Ferracini asked . At last  --  this , of course , was what had been burning in all their minds . " We 're gon na go in and take out Ay-dolf 's return-gate , " Cassidysaid before Warren or Selby could reply . " Why act like you do n't know , Harry ? None of us thinks we came along just for the ride . " Nevertheless , all eyes remained fixed on Major Warren . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded . " Where is it ? " Payne asked . Warren frowned in the act of raising his fork to his mouth , and hesitated . " You 've all come a long way , and the subject is n't really appropriate to this evening , " he said . " Leave it until tomorrow , okay ? It 's going to be a busy day . First thing in the morning , we 'll be coming back here to pick you up for breakfast with Claud , Anna , and Arthur . After that , you 're all going to meet Churchill and Professor Lindemann for a preliminary briefing . " " Is that when we get to meet the British half of the act ? " Ryan inquired . Warren shook his head . " Forget it . " The others exchanged puzzled glances . " There is n't going to be any British half , " Selby explained . " Just us  --  everyone here except Gordon , " Warren said . " He has to stick around to help get a bomb program moving if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So what happened to this idea of getting British replacements for the backups we were supposed to have gotten from JFK back in July ? " " That 's out , " Warren said . " The politics between the British and the French stinks . The generals are all playing ostrich with their heads stuck in the last war . The staff in London does n't get along with their commander in France . He does n't get along with the French , and none of them gets along with the war minister . Some of them have even started bitching behind each other 's backs direct to the King . " Warren shook his head . " It 's all a mess.  |p220I  've talked about it with Claud , and we 've agreed we 'd be better off staying out and running our own firm in our own way . " Six men were going to pit themselves against what was probably the most heavily protected place in Europe  --  or , very likely , anywhere . Ferracini slumped back as the enormity of what Warren was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , and for once even Cassidy seemed dazed . Selby , watching , attributed their expressions to fatigue . Anyhow , you guys have come a long way . Let 's save it all for tomorrow and try to get some sleep tonight , eh ? " It was all right for Selby . Selby would n't be going . Cassidy leaned back in his chair . " Just us , period , or will we be using local contacts ? " he asked . Warren waved his hand decisively in front of his face . " Not another word about it until tomorrow morning , " he ordered . " Gordon , tell us again what you were saying earlier about that crazy horse and cart . " " There 's a famous old firm of hatters in London , called Scott 's , " Selby told the table . " They 've always used a horsedrawndelivery van  --  a kind of tradition now . It 's very distinguished , with nice woodwork all painted and varnished , and liveried coachman and footman in cockaded top hats . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street with everything just the same as usual , except that the guys have traded their hats for steel helmets  --  I guess until the war 's over . " He shook his head . " These people . . . I do n't know . . . I 'm not sure it 's so inevitable that Hitler will walk all over them . SometimesI still think it could go either way . " " We all know what happened last time , " Lamson drawled laconically . " True , but they were under the wrong management , " Selby said . Then he added , " If only something could be done about that .... " Payne caught the curious note in his voice . " What are you trying to say ? " he asked . Selby glanced uncertainly at Warren . Warren gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head , and Selby steered the conversation to other things . Later in the evening , after the dinner party had broken up and the others had turned in for the night , Ferracini , Cassidy , and Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lobby . " What did you mean earlier , Gordon , when you said something about changing the management ? " Payne asked as they sat down around him at a table . " Oh , nothing really ... "  | " Who do you think you 're kidding ? " Cassidy said . " Come on , give . We 're curious . " Selby hesitated , then emitted a long sigh and nodded . Anna 's convinced that Claud and Arthur are up to something that they 're not letting on about , " he said , lowering his voice . " Claud has taken more key people into his confidence over the gate and what 's going on in the U.S. He says it 's to stiffen the country 's morale , but Anna does n't think that 's the main reason . " What does she think , then ? " Ferracini asked . " That Claud 's meddling again , " Selby said . " It gives him directaccess to more of the nation 's policy shapers . He 's having dinner tonight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't here . They 're both among the people who have been saying some pretty tough things about the way the government'sbeen handling the war so far . You see , it broadens Claud 's base for pulling political strings . Chamberlain might be a sincere guy and all that , but he 's just not a war leader . Churchill 's the only one with any fighting spirit in the whole War Cabinet . Anna called him ' a cuckoo put in a nest of baby hedge-sparrows . ' Now she thinks Claud is carrying out preparatory maneuvers to capitalizeon having gotten Churchill in there . " " You mean some of the sparrows might be kicked out before much longer ? " Payne said . " That , " Selby agreed . He paused for a moment . " Unless the idea is to bring down the entire British government , which might explain why Claud and Arthur are being so secretive . " The others stared at him incredulously . " Surely not ? " Payne protested . " Not even Claud would try to pull off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange , humorless kind of way . " That 's exactly what I told Anna , " he said . And what did she say ? " Payne asked . " She agreed , " Selby replied . " She said her imagination must have been running away with her . Why , it would be almost as audacious as trying to go back in time to change history ! "  |p222LONDON  IN DAYLIGHT STRUCK Ferracini as a caricature of a city at war . The superficial trappings of wartime were in evidence everywhere , to be sure : shop windows boarded up or crisscrossed with adhesive tape ; balloons overhead ; signs over sandbagged entrancesindicating public airraid shelters ; lots of uniforms on the sidewalks ; but the people seemed like the mildly embarrassed hosts of a lavish masquerade party trying to act as if nothing had happened when none of the guests had shown up . Many of them were no longer bothering to carry their gas masks , he noticed , which the American newspapers had made a big thing of back in September . All the superficiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that England still did n't fully realizeit was at war , or if it did , nobody comprehended what war with modern totalitarianism meant . In September , the country had been grimly resigned to a mood of " let 's get it over with . " But since then the officially promulgated horror stories had been proven wrong , and the people had concluded that they 'd have been better off trusting in their own instincts all along . Now all authority was suspect , if not openly ridiculed . Foreigners  --  Germans , Italians , French , Russians ; they were all pretty much thep223same  --  were too excitable and not very bright . They just needed to be left alone for a while to sort out their squabbles and calm down . Then everyone would be able to forget the fancy dress and other nonsense , and get back to being decent and civilized . Yet at the same time it was a pleasantly different England from the one Ferracini had known previously . The grimness and the crushing despair that had come after years of universal impoverishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a swastika to be seen anywhere . In the tradition that had remained unbroken through centuries , it was free . That was the whole problem with the English , Ferracini was beginning to see : They were simply incapable of conceiving how things could be otherwise . The preliminary briefing for Ampersand took place in a vault beneath the Admiralty buildings on Whitehall , which on Churchill 's instructions had been permanently reserved for undisclosed , highly classified naval business . All ten of the Proteus team now in England , i.e. , everyone except Mortimer Greene and Kurt Scholder , were present , along with Churchill , Lindemann , and a confidential secretary to record the proceedings . Ferracini had learned something about Churchill during Proteustraining , as had all the team , and had gleaned more from further reading during the months at Gatehouse . He knew that Churchill had fallen from favor in the Great War , made enemies among British socialists and conservatives alike , and was alleged to be erratic and impetuous . But against that , Churchill had been one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that others were only now beginning to wake up to , and he had died gun in hand behind a barricade , defending what he believed in . In Ferracini 's book that said he could n't be all bad . Besides that , Ferracini had never found reason to doubt Claud 's judgment . As he stood in a corner sipping tea  --  he was learning already that the English could n't do anything without having a cup of tea first  --  and watching the stocky , red-haired , bulldog-jawed figure standing by the shrouded table in the center of the room and grumbling to Winslade about bureaucratic pigheadednessand red tape , Ferracini could sense already that Churchill was an exception to the general picture he had begun to form of the British . Back in 1975 , Claud had fought hard to get the mission planners to accept Churchill as the first contact . Ferraciniwas already responding to Churchill 's personality , even though Churchill had n't as yet really said anything . Whatever else might he going on between other English and French gener/als , politicians , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager . It was a shame , Ferracini thought , that he could n't do the same for the whole country . The session began with a few introductory words from Churchill , in which he welcomed the newly-arrived Americans to Britain and expressed the hope that many more would be followingbefore it was too late . Then Winslade picked up a pointer and took the floor , while Major Warren let down a set of successivelylarger-scale wall-maps showing Europe and parts of Germany . " I 'm sure there 's no need to tell you what the objective is , " Winslade began breezily . He glanced around to confirm his guess , then raised the pointer to indicate a region just over a hundred miles southwest of Berlin . " From this moment on , the Nazi return-gatewill be referred to as ' Hammerhead , ' " he said . " It 's locatedhere , in the Leipzig area , deep underground at the chemicals and munitions plant near Weissenberg . " He paused and looked around expectantly . " Leipzig ? " Cassidy repeated . He looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other assignment back in ' 71 or ' 72 ... to bring back those papers and stuff that somebody had copiedfrom some local archives . " " Purely a coincidence , " Winslade said with obvious insincerity . He turned and unveiled the table in the center to reveal a detailed model of the Weissenberg plant . " The target , gentlemen , " he said . The site was roughly square , and from familiar kinds of structures and the vehicles that had been included to indicate scale , looked about a mile or so along a side . The back lay along the bank of a river , probably the Elster , and consisted mostly of loading docks and moorings for barges . One side of the plant was flanked by trees cut back to leave a clear strip outside the boundaryfence ; on the other side , the land rose toward a bluff of open , rugged high-ground overlooking a bend in the river . The front faced an expanse of open ground that ended at a workers ' residentialsuburb of Weissenberg , consisting mainly of brick rowhouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight entrance , and a branch of the roadway ran outside the fence for some distance to the large main gate . The fence itself was unremarkable for an industrial installation , a high wire construction with floodlights at intervals and a number of small side gates . A cluster of what looked like office and laboratory buildings stood inside the main gate , and behind them stretched a confusion of factory buildings , processing towers , storage tanks , re/action vessels , smokestacks , and vats , all tied together in tangles of pipework , roadways , rail sidings , and canals , along with all the other paraphernalia of a large chemicals manufacturing complex . Whoever built the model had even added a few puffs of cottonwoolsmoke to some of the smokestacks for realism . But there was also something odd , Ferracini realized as he looked more closely . And now that he had noticed it , it continuedgetting odder . In a remote corner of the site , on the uphill side toward the bluff , a much smaller zone projected out from the main site area like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A separate road and rail link branched off the spur outside the main plant and followed the perimeter to enter the fenced-off zone through its own , formidable-looking gate . Everything about this appendage seemed out of place . The constructions inside it were squat , windowless , and solidlooking , with sloping walls , suggesting more a fortress or a system of blockhouses than anything connected with the rest of the plant . The surrounding enclosure consisted of three well-spaced fences with the strips between filled by tangles of barbed wire . And the watchtowers at the corners and halfway between looked as if they contained more than just floodlights . " Quite an asset to the German war economy , " Winslade commented after a suitable pause . He moved forward and pointed out various details . " For the most part it conforms to standard layout . The area over here is devoted to bulk chemical processing . This inner fence  --  here , along here , and around to here  --  encloses the munitions manufacturing compound , which produces heavy artillery shells and Luftwaffe bombs . Filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of buildings .. . of bombs in this group . . . and the finished products move through to final storage here , by the railhead , before shipment out . There 's also a ' specials ' section , here , which handles things like on-off experimental devices and low-volume test batches . Casings are n't manufactured on site , but come in by rail . " Winslade moved around a corner to reach the rear of the model . " The power plant is at the back by the coal-yard and unloadingwharves , and the place next to it is a central boilerhouse for raising process steam . The buildings inside the front gate are administrative offices , and the ones behind , quality assurance and research labs . Here , outside the front gate , is the works ' cafeteria and social club . This is the medical center , and that , a training school for apprentices . " There were no questions . By the time they left , everyone going on the mission would know the place as well as the streets they had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " But there is something unusual , as I suspect some of you have noticed already " His manner became less casual as he tapped the pointer on the casemate-like buildings of the fencedoffcorner annex . " Here , in 1935 , the Ordnance Department of the German Army began constructing a research and testing facilityfor secret work on explosives and rocket propellants . Becauseof the nature of the work , and because those who mattered knew that war would be only a matter of time , it was built underground , and its surface buildings made bomb-proof . However , when the basic construction work was completed two years later , the Nazi high command ordered the site to be handed over to the Todt construction organization of the SS . Hammerhead was dismantled , moved there , and reassembled from a place it had occupied in the Bavarian Alps  --  not far from Berchtesgaden , as a matter of fact , which was why Hitler 's mountain retreat was built there . " Churchill interjected , " My first reaction was that only a lunaticwould put a vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am assured it would be unaffected even if everything on the surface blew up at once . " " It 's more than strong enough and deep enough , " Lindemann confirmed . Winslade put the pointer down , slipped one hand into his jacket pocket  --  he was outfitted as a British naval officer that morning  --  and made a sweeping gesture over the model with the other . " On the other hand , this location offers many advantages . No one will question the need for security . Strange-looking objectsjects going in and out will attract no undue attention . It has good road , rail , and water freight-handling facilities . And it lies within easy traveling distance of Berlin . " He turned and gazed back at the model . " The surface portion of the installation that houses Hammerhead is referred to by the people at the plant as the ' Citadel . ' All that the average worker knows is that it 's a place the SS owns  --  you stay away from it and do n't ask what goes on inside . Hammerhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavern , behind concreteroof , walls , and floor all tens of feet thick . " There are two elevator shafts giving access , one at each end . The main one is under the large hexagonal blockhouse that the rails disappear into , there , and there 's a smaller emergency shaft at the rear . Each shaft is protected by its own system of alarms , armored doors , and guard posts . A permanent garrison of three hundred fully equipped SS infantry is housed inside . Both shafts connect to the facility on two levels . The connecting corridors are covered by observation and gun ports and can be sealed offp227from the inside . As an additional precaution , the approach passagewaysare also protected by gas-injection and flame-throwing devices . " As he finished , Winslade wheeled to face the Special Operations squad and beamed at them challengingly . A tomblike silence descended . Churchill allowed his gaze to flicker curiously over the faces of the Americans who were hearingall this for the first time . At last Ferracini said dryly , " I , er .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it by a frontal assault . " Winslade smiled as if he had been enjoying a small private joke . " There are limits , Harry , even to the things that I consider reasonable . " He turned back toward the table and slid away a movable section of the mc2el to reveal a cutaway view of the underground installation and the two shafts leading down to it . The model showed other things down below ground , too , such as rock strata , piping ducts , and drainage channels . Also , there was something that looked like another vertical shaft of some kind . It lay under the general plant area , outside the Citadel and its defenses . " The first industry on this site was a soap and dye works that grew around a potash and rock-salt mine dating from the late Middle Ages , " Winslade went on . " Although no mining has been done for over a century , some of the old shafts were found to be still in existence when the later plant was contructed , and subsequentlywhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , but some that proved useful were cleaned out and retained . " He indicated the shaft that the partitioning of the model had revealed . " This one , for example , still exists underneath one of the waste collection and disposal plants  --  that 's the building and the tanks behind it at the top , there . To avoid dangerous reactionsbetween inappropriate substances  --  acids and organics , for example  --  a number of separate waste-handling systems are used . In general , solid wastes are taken off down the river in barges , and liquids are simply dumped down old mine shafts such as this one and get lost in the collapsed workings and galleriesbelow  --  very simple , and very cheap . " But there was a further channel , running from the lowest level of the underground Hammerhead installation , diagonally downward and in under the main plant area to meet the old mineshaft deep down . Winslade traced it with his pointer . " I said earlier that the excavation housing Hammerhead was originally intended for secret chemical work . That , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloping conduit , which as you can see discharges into one of the main plant 's disposal shafts . " Winslade smirked apologetically through his spectacles ,  |p228unable  to resist it . " The armadillo 's anal orifice , as it were , " he told the listeners . And that 's our way in ? " Ryan said . Just at that moment hewas n't in the mood for bad jokes . " Quite . " There was a short silence . At last , Payne said , " With all that protection up top , well . . . it seems kind of strange that something like this was overlooked . " " The place is n't serving the purpose it was built for , " Winslade reminded everyone . " That conduit has never been used . There was a lot of confusion and mislaid blueprints when the SS took over from the Ordnance Department . It 's almost certain that nobody there today even knows it exists . It took us an enormousamount of detective work to find out about it ourselves , which involved tracking down one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of things . " " So all we have to do , " Cassidy summarized , " is get across to the other side of Germany with a war on , get inside the plant and into that shaft , go down it a few hundred feet and follow the conduit up into Hammerhead , blow the target , and then get out again after we 've stirred up a hornets ' nest of three hundred SS . " " Yes , " Winslade agreed pleasantly . " Except for one other thing . The conduit joins the main disposal shaft quite deep down . We ought to assume that it lies below the surface of the liquid that 's been poured down there , perhaps some considerable depth below . That , ah , would be another reason , of course , why somebody responsible for security would n't consider it very seriouslyas a possible means of entry . " " Exactly what kind of liquid are we talking about , Claud ? " Ferracini asked suspiciously . " Impossible to say , " Winslade replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that kind of thing . But you can generally count on a mixture of acid solutions , cyanides , nitrides , arsenic compounds , organics . . . in other words , it 'll be highly toxic and probably corrosive . Also , the gases trapped above the liquid surface are most likely lethal . " This time everyone in the group was too stunned to say anything . Winslade let the mood linger for a few seconds . Then he informedthem , " But the sealed canisters being shipped from New York were brought with the mission as insurance against preciselythis kind of eventuality . They contain kits of specially developedprotective clothing , complete with breathing apparatus , and other equipment . We 've already made arrangements for practice and familiarization sessions for you all , first at the Royalp229Navy 's submarine and escape school at Portsmouth , and then in a more realistic environment at a flooded tin mine in Cornwall . " Winslade , true to form , had delivered the worst up front and was saving no nasty surprises . As the initial shock started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the questions began coming thick and fast . If this stuff did turn out to be corrosive , how long could these suits be expected to give protection ? Cassidy wanted to know . It depended , Winslade told him . It was no accident that one of the party , Captain Payne , was a chemist . The equipment included an analysis kit , and the answer to the question would depend on his findings at the time . How would they descend the shaft and get up the sloping conduit ? They would be spending some time at the limestone caverns in Derbyshire for a course on caving techniques and equipment . What did the shaft walls consist of ? What was their probable condition ? How big was the conduit , what was its gradient , and how slippery was it likely to be ? What was at the top of the conduit ? A steel coverplate resting on a steel-rimmed concrete seating , secured by eight oneinch-diameterbolts . Thermite charges would be used to melt the fixed nuts holding the bolts . And when the seal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement level of Hammerhead , containing pumps , air circulation equipment , and other machinery , with the return-gate itself on the level above . Since the precautions against intruders were directed upward , not down , an experiencedteam proficient in stealth should have a reasonable chance of placing demolition charges and effecting a safe exit . " And if not ... well , that 's why we attach so much importance to initiative training , " Winslade completed . A silence followed , punctuated by shuffling feet and long intakesof breath . Then Ferracini said , " That 's all very fine as far as the assault goes , Claud , but how are we supposed to carry suits , weapons , caving and other gear , plus enough explosives to do the job , halfway across Germany ? " " You 're not , " Winslade replied . " That side of the operation depends on factors that could n't be anticipated , and therefore , has n't been finalized yet . You 'll be traveling in pairs , but the detailswill be the subject of another briefing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we just fly into Berlin from Sweden or somewhere as American neutrals  --  journalists or something ? " Ryan asked . " Too many problems with being kept under surveillance byp230the police all the time , " Winslade answered . " Best not to risk it . As for getting the equipment there , we 're looking into several alternatives . Air-dropping it is one possibility . Another is smugglingit in independently . Again , this will be covered in detail later . " " How about contacts in the area ? " Cassidy asked finally . " Can we expect local help ? " In reply Winslade looked inquiringly at Churchill , who looked at Lindemann . Lindemann cleared his throat . " Oh , my department , I think . " He stood up and moved a couple of paces forward . " As some of you may know , I spent some years in Germanyafter the Great War . When the Nazis came to power , I made several return visits to help endangered European scientists , especiallythose of Jewish descent , to escape and find suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as a matter of fact . Anyhow , to answer the question , yes , I have been making discreet inquiries through channels I prefer not to disclose , and it should be possible to arrange some help for you from people who are opposed to the Nazi regime enough to want to help , and whom I consider sufficiently reliable . " Winslade added , " But we wo n't say more about them for now . Naturally , each pair of you will be given the name of your own contact only . " There remained only one further question . Payne asked it . " When ? " Major Warren answered . " At present , we 're aiming for the end of February . " He looked at the squad and treated them to an imitation of a sadistic leer . " But do n't get carried away with visionsof a nice , cozy Christmas . We 've got one or two other things lined up in addition to what Claud talked about . You 've all been having it too easy for too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll all be getting back into shape . I 've booked us all a vacation on assault course training  --  as guests of the British Army . " Anna Kharkiovitch was sitting at the back of the room with Gordon Selby , reflecting on what had been said . It was obvious that long before the mission 's departure from 1975 , Winslade had seen fit to take elaborate precautions against a possible failure to reestablish contact . How much had Claud known all along , and how much more might he know now that he was n't telling ? Was there no chance of any of them ever returning ? Had there never been any chance ? Or was the explanation nothing more sinister than Claud 's habit , inculcated by a lifetime of working amid secrecy and in/trigue , of never telling anybody more than they needed to know to do what needed doing at the time ? As always , everything connected with Claud was murky , enigmatic , and uncertain . And that , to a woman of Anna 's dispositionand temperament , added up to : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientistsworking at Gatehouse . For the first time , the monitoring instruments connected to the return-gate indicated that it was picking up pulsed energy . The only evidence was a flickering trace on the screen of a primitive oscilloscope hooked up to a typically outlandish Fermi improvisation of coils , vacuum tubes , and bits of wire , but the characteristics of the pulses confirmed that the long-awaited contact between different universes had at last been initiated . Much had yet to be done before meaningful information could be exchanged , let alone physical objects , but it was a start . A fine seasonal present for all involved . In one of those inexplicable flashes of sudden insight that illuminate the lives of the truly great , Einstein had realized that a crucial but unquestioned assumption  --  that time at the two ends of a connection between future and past would run at the same speed  --  was without any proven foundation . In day after day of debating and theorizing that usually went on all through the night over take-out snacks and endless coffee , the red-eyed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revised mathematical model . The equations deduced from the model revealed that , indeed , as Einsteinhad suggested , the rates of time-flow at the two ends of ap233link would not be the same . They would differ , in fact , according to the fourth power of the time interval between the ends , with time at the future end running slower ; thus , if time ran twice as slowly a certain distance into the future , it would run sixteen times as slowly twice as far into the future , and so on . The exact relationship depended on certain constants that could only be found by experiment , and which were not yet known . This explained why the 1975 machine had failed to contact them . Before a projector could link with and power a return-gate , it first coarse-scanned the designated zone of spacetime with a probe " beam , " closing the connection only when it detected the formation of a multidimensional field resonance across the dividinginterval . For the probe to lock on , a precise synchronizationhad to be achieved with certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio receiver 's having to be tuned to the same frequency as the transmitter to pick up a station . Synchronization depended on timekeeping , and if no allowancewere made for the difference in time-rates at the two ends , the link-up would n't work . It really was  --  well , almost  --  as simple as that . With the key fallacy exposed , the rest was expected to follow fairly rapidly , and the scientists set up preliminary experiments to determine the unknown constants . This required little more than modifying the operating ranges of some of the electronics , which was a straightforward task , and the first tests produced an incoming signal that was identified as a component of the probe beam . Measurements of the pulse rate and other parameters , and comparison with the known design data for the machinetransmitting from 1975 , showed that , from the 1939 reference frame , time would be flowing slower in 1975 by a factor of 5.7 . Getting the link to work would n't be as easy as twiddling the tuning knob of a radio to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurt Scholder , who , in 1975 , had rushed through the construction of the system from purloined German records had n't fully understood the fundamentals , the return-gate was n't designed to be " tunable " ; and the fixed modethat it worked in was wrong . Putting it right would require the reengineering of some components and the complete redesign of others . By mid-December , a stream of requisitions and specificationsfor the required parts was going out to suitable laboratories and workshops . Thanks to Roosevelt 's involvement , there was no problem in obtaining whatever level of authorization was needed to ensure top-priority response . Once that work was under way , the scientists followed upp234some rough calculations they had poduced which suggested that , even though all modifications had not been completed , a partial interaction between the machine and the probe beam scanning from 1975 ought to be possible . When the first of the reengineeredcomponents came in and were fitted , the scientists set about putting their hunch to the test . " It 's right on the threshold , " Scholder announced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apparatusthat was strung together on a portable bench placed near one of the control panels . " It 's rising again . . . . Close  --  nineteen point two . Very close . . . fading slightly now , eighteen-nine .. . eight . " The green trace flickering on the tiny screen that Fermi was watching swelled for a second or two , then shrank again . " Q must have been above ninety-eight percent of critical that time , " he said . He adjusted a control on the panel and checked a reading . " I 've reduced beta to five . Recharge the bank and let 's try that again with everything else the same . " Einstein , Teller , and two of the assistants looked on , Einstein puffing his pipe and watching with amused interest like an amiablescience teacher ; Teller more intent , serious , and a shade edgy after almost forty-eight hours without sleep . It was Christmas Eve , and they had just finished installing the first of a set of resonantcavity devices delivered to Columbia University that morningfrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device would n't be enough to support the communications channel , the hope was that it might just give the system enough responsiveness for the probe beam to find it . That would be an important milestone reached . " Up to charge , " Scholder said . His voice was calm and matter-of-fact . " Loop energized . Okay . . . the ramp 's climbing now . " Fermi took up the commentary . " Nineteen . . . nineteenpointtwo . . . point three . . . " He tensed visibly with excitement . " Three-five . . . point four . . . my God , it 's going to make it ! " Teller stepped forward and peered over Fermi 's shoulder . " Q is critical now , " he said . " Nineteen point five ! " Fermi exclaimed . At the same instant , an orange lamp glowed on one side of a panel crudely hacked out of sheet aluminum , and a pointer on a dial next to it swung up from zero on the scale and steadied . Scholder smiled tiredly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've got contact ! " Teller shouted behind them . " The probe beam 's reacting ! " The assistants standing with Ein/stein cheered , and other figures began appearing from places around the rig to see what all the fuss was about . The readings confirmed that although the return-gate systemwas responding , the partial resonance that it was setting up was too feeble for the probe to lock on and open the auxiliary channel . The interaction itself , however , should have induced a disturbance in the physical dynamics of the beam sufficient to alert the operators at the far end to the fact that the probe was encountering something . If that condition could be maintained , it offered an opportunity , perhaps , for conveying a crude form of message by making and breaking the energizing circuit in a codedpattern . They had already agreed to try it if the test succeeded , so no time was lost on deliberations . As soon as the pointer registering contact had stabilized , Scholder commenced flipping the energizersupply switch up and down , using it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . P-R-O-T-E-U-S .. . He continued until Fermi announced that the fleeting contacthad been lost . It reappeared a few minutes later and then died completely . " We were lucky to get that , " Teller commented . " It was right on the threshold all the time . We 're not going to achieve much more until the phase modulator amplifiers arrive . " " Edward 's right , " Fermi said , sitting back in his chair . " And we wo n't see them until after the holiday . I vote we all take a break . Hitler or no Hitler , tomorrow is reserved for my wife .. . assuming I still have one . What 's the point of preserving freedom if you 're never free for a moment to benefit from it ? " The others agreed . They shut down the system and collected coats , hats , and papers to take home . After a final round of salutes , best wishes , and arrangements made by some to get togetherlater in the evening or sometime for dinner the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teller agreed to take Fermi in his car and drive Einstein to Princeton before returning to his own apartment in Morningside Heights . " You know , it 's a strange thought , " Fermi remarked as the three of them walked through the machine area toward the front of the building , where the vehicles were parked . " If they do spot the perturbations in 1975 , then with a dilation factor of almostsix , only two months or so will have gone by in their world since the Proteus people left . " " If it 's the same 1975 , " Teller said . " We do n't know how many universes might he aiming probe beams back at the zone we 're in . How do we know we 've hit the right one ? What 's the probability of another ' crossed wire ' ? In fact , just how does thep236whole mess manage to keep itself untangled at all ? " He sighed heavily as they descended the steps of the loading dock . " There 's so much that we do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them looked at Einstein . " I have n't the faintest intention of spoiling my Christmas by even thinking about it , " he informed them as they climbed into Teller 's car . A plainclothes military policeman opened one of the large doors to let the car back out . Evening was closing fast . Flurries of snow filled the air , and slush from an earlier fall still covered the ground . Just as Teller was about to engage first and move away , a shout came from across the road  --  a woman 's shout . The three in the car looked around . A week or so previously , someone had rented the small storehousewith adjoining office shack across the road . It had been standing empty since the summer . One day , a truck had appeared to unload a few crates , but the only signs of life observed since then by the Gatehouse security guards had been a woman going in and out once or twice , her car parked outside for most of the day , and a light inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine check , but nothing amiss was found . Now the woman was running toward them and waving . " Do n't go  --  wait a minute ! " She arrived , puffing , at the car , a woman in her mid-forties , perhaps , a little on the plump side , wearing a fur hat with earpieces and a heavy tweed coat . Teller wound down the window . " Thanks , " the woman said . She rested her purse on the window ledge and got her breath back . " Sorry to trouble you , but I 've been an idiot . I left my headlights on , and now the battery 's dead . Could I get a start off yours ? I ca n't use those hand-cranks , and I do have some cables . " Teller glanced at the others , nodded , and was about to reply when the security guard who had opened the door came over and intervened . " That 's okay , sir , you carry on , " he told Teller . Then , to the woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crank it for you , ma'am . " " Thank you . You 're so kind . " All part of the service . " The guard waved Teller on his way , and the car moved off along the street . Then the guard turned and began walking back to close the warehouse door . The woman followed him , but he stopped and raised a warning hand . ' Ah , wait out here , ma'am , if you do n't mind , " he told her . " I 'll just be a few seconds . " The woman , who was known as " Musketeer , " stopped obediently . She could see from where she was standing that there was nothing remarkable inside the doors . But she had managedp237to get a good view of the three men in the car . Albert Einstein she had recognized immediately . She had n't known the other two , but she 'd got a good shot of their faces from the car 's window ledge with the camera built into her purse . And there had been plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1939  --  1940 was the coldest that Europe had experienced in forty-five years . Around Britain the Channel froze off Folkestone and Dungeness ; the Thames was solid ice for eight miles from Teddington to Sunbury ; and in parts of Derbyshire the snow drifted up to the roofs of farmhouses and cottages . On the fifth day of the New Year , Minister of War Leslie HoreBelisharesigned , the first of Anna Kharkiovitch 's " baby hedgesparrows " to be pushed from the nest , and there was a reshuffling of ministers ; the machinations that Winslade and Bannering were orchestrating from behind the scenes were producing tangibleresults . Whether these would add up to enough and in time , however , was another matter . Ferracini and the rest of Ampersand knew no more about the incident than appeared in the papers ; they did n't have too much time to care what might be behind it . They spent the Christmas and New Year period with one of the British regiments training on Dartmoor , a bleak expanse of wild and windswept heath , scrub , hills , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed as American volunteers temporarily assigned to the unit pending further posting elsewhere . Although the course was tame in comparison to the brutalp239physical and psychological demands of the three-month screeningprocess that would-be Special Operations volunteers endured , everyone in the Ampersand group was grateful for the program of calisthenics , combat sports , and swimming that MajorWarren had imposed during the months at Gatehouse . For a month , they raced with full battle-packs over treacherous , iceboundassault courses ; hauled themselves , cursing and perspiring , up climbing nets ; scaled walls and ramparts ; and negotiated swaying plank and rope bridges over deep ravines . They trudged for days on cross-country marches until blisters appeared and hardened on all the old , familiar spots on their feet ; and they went through open-air physical drill , jumping , climbing , vaulting , and performing team sit-ups , squats , and presses with telephonepoles , ten men to a pole . During the course , they saw why Warren had abandoned his idea of replacing their missing reinforcements with British volunteers . Perhaps letting them see the reasons for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't that the British troops lacked guts or spirit . Far from it . The Tommies for the most part were enthusiastic and hard-working , did n't complain too much , and accepted the inevitablescrew-ups and lousy breaks that were the soldier 's lot with cheerful resignation . Lean and hardy like their American counterpartsafter the years of the economic slump , they were keen to get over to the other side , get the job done , and come home again . They knew that was how it would happen because that was how it had always happened . That was the problem : They had no idea what they were up against . They were inexperienced , naive , and totally trusting in officerswho belonged to a world that had ceased to exist . The Germanswere " all wind and trousers , " a lance corporal from Wigan told the Americans over a supper of bullied beef , beans , and gravy . " They like marchin ' oop an ' down wit ' flags an ' bands , an ' pushin ' poor little booggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally puts ' is foot down , they soon go scurryin ' for their ' oles . " The same mistakes had n't been made this time as in 1914 . The Maginot Line was there now , and the blokes behind it were ready . Ready for what ? Ferracini wondered . Their combat training consisted almost entirely of a few sessionson a rifle range and in grenade pits  --  with limited ammunition  --  andformalized , old-school bayonet drill . They learned how to dig trenches , shore them up with timber , and fit duckboards ;  |p240how  to blanco webbing ; and how to shine boots . It was ironic : yes , all the things were being done right that should have been done in 1914 . But this was 1940 . What of antitank weapons ? What of tactics for dealing with massed , air-supported armor smashing through on narrow fronts and racing along main roads at speeds that would have left the Great War commanders paralyzed ? The German field tractors could haul rubber-tired , six-inch guns up rough hillsides at forty miles per hour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could fixed batteries , dug in miles behind a front that would supposedly remain static , be expected to counter them ? What of cooperation with friendly tanks and aircraft ? The Germancommanders used radio to keep track of movements in the highly mobile , fast-changing situations that they anticipated . How could generals who still depended on dispatch riders and runners hope even to know what was happening , let alone do anything to affect it ? At one training session just after New Year 's Day , Ferracini , Cassidy , and Lamson looked on in disbelief while a British brigadier , complete with knee-high cavalry boots , white walrus mustache , and port-wine complexion , gave instruction on tackling the Junkers 87 dive bomber  --  the infamous Stuka  --  with a rifle . " You 'll find it quite straightforward if you keep your heads , " the brigadier assured his attentive flock . " Stand up to them and take them high on the climb , like a pheasant . A brace a day per man would add up to a jolly good bag  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't laugh . The next day , the hand-to-hand combat instructor , a big , sadisticsergeant from Glasgow who liked knocking the new recruitsabout , picked on Floyd Lamson as a stooge and came out of it lightly with a cracked collarbone , torn cartilage in the neck , and a raw shin . Cassidy explained hastily to the shocked C.O. that Lamson had ancestral blood from an Indian tribe notorious for its instability . " They were the ones who wiped out General Custer , " Cassidytold the officer , while Lamson winced inwardly . " His grandfather was a cannibal . It 's not really his fault . . . . And they do make good scouts . " The C.O. gave Lamson the benefit of the doubt and dismissed the affair with a plea for him to at least try to behave like a civilized Christian . The number of beers subsequentlybought for Lamson at the pub not far from the camp by grinning young Britishers more than compensated . The British were n't the only ones gearing up to fight the last war all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fromp241what Ferracini and the others had heard and read in the course of almost a year in America , the majority of U.S. generals still seemed to be having trouble grasping that the planet continued beyond Maine . It was n't so much that they were slow in responding to change . Leaders and rulers always had much to lose and little to gain from the disruptions brought by change ; therefore , invariably , they constituted the conservative elements of society . That much had been true throughout history . The difference this time was that the thinking of one side was being shaped by minds whose experience came from eighty-five years in the future . Even so , the Ampersand troops agreed privately , in the four months that had gone by since the beginning of September , the West 's leaders should have learned more from Poland than they had . The New Year was colder and icier than usual , even in Berlin . Despite years of incessant , vitriolic Nazi propaganda , the majority of the population had n't wanted war . In contrast to the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had marched off to the fronts , the streets had remained quiet and empty at the news of Poland 's invasion . Now with things like the blackout , a war surtax of fifty percent on top of income tax , the virtual disappearance of gasoline , the introduction of ration cards for food , soap , shoes , and clothing , and coffee'sreplacement by a coarse substitute made from roasted barley seeds , the average Berliner felt the cold of 1940 psychologicallyas well as physically . The scene in the Tiergarten presented a curious contrast , with children skating on frozen ponds , and sandbagged antiaircraftbatteries brooding menacingly beneath snow-laden camouflagenets . Colonel Piekenbrock and Lieutenant Colonel Boeckel were taking a lunchtime stroll from the Bendlerstrasse . They walked slowly side by side , caps pulled low , faces tucked down behind the upturned collars of their greatcoats , snow crunching beneath their jackboots . " There 's no chance of mistaken identity ? " Piekenbrock said . His breath turned to white vapor in the cold air as he spoke . Boeckel shook his head . " The faces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered in Teller 's name . We 're quite certain . " They walked on in silence for a while . " So what do you make of it ? " Piekenbrock asked . Boeckel knew by now that this tendencyof Piekenhrock 's did n't mean he was perpetually devoid ofp242ideas . It was simply his way to ask a subordinate 's opinions beforevoicing his own . It helped him recognize talent , and it disarmedyes-men . " Well , we seem to have uncovered a small , but highly professional , unpublicized unit of the American Army , specially trained in guerilla methods and undercover operations . They 've even staged practice missions from a disguised base in New York . " Agreed , " Piekenbrock said , nodding . ' And now we find Einstein visiting this same base . Not only that , but he 's with Teller and Fermi , both of them specialists in the same field . " Boeckel glanced at his superior uncertainly . " Oh , yes , yes , " Piekenbrock said , waving a leather-gloved hand impatiently and thrusting it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Einstein is a great scientist . Never mind the nonsense that Goebbels churns out for the masses . And you say that this Hungarianand the Italian specialize in the same field . What field is that ? " " I made inquiries at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute , " Boeckel replied . ' About a year ago , an important experiment was conductedhere in Berlin which caused an international stir among physicists investigating the inner structure of atoms . Apparently , there are good reasons to suppose that atomic processes involvingthe element uranium might release quite large quantities of energy  --  enormous quantities , in fact . Some of the scientists at the KWI say it could lead to a revolution one day in powering industry , ships , and so forth . And in weapons . " Piekenbrock frowned . ' Atoms ? But they 're just tiny things , are n't they ? " " Extremely so , sir . " Amazing . Anyhow ... " " It seems that both Teller and Fermi are noted for their work in that field . In fact , Fermi was awarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America when he went to Sweden to collect it . " ' A Jew ? " " His wife  --  partly . " " I wonder if we can really afford to lose too many people like that in the long run . Anyhow , that 's not our department . " They came to a small hump-backed bridge over a frozen stream and stopped for two Wehrmacht generals going the other way . The generals returned their salutes as they passed . They carried on walking again , and Boeckel continued , " In the last year , official interest in uranium has been expressed in England , France , and America . Also , in America especially , there has beenp243a marked decline in the amount of information being published on research connected with the subject . In other words , it seems that the West might be taking this notion of extra-powerful weapons seriously . " " Do you think this could have something to do with the super-bombs that the Fuhrer has been telling us we 'll have in two years ? " Piekenbrock asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It seems that both sides are onto the same thing . " Piekenbrock nodded . And the Americans have trained a specialunit to infiltrate Germany and conduct espionage or sabotageoperations on what our people are doing , " he completed . " These scientists were probably going to the training base in New York to give technical briefings on what to look for and things like that , eh ? It makes sense . I think we can forget this idea of an assassination squad being sent after the Fuhrer . " " My conclusion also , " Boeckel agreed . He waited for a moment ; then , seeing that Piekenbrock was n't about to reply at that point , he went on , " I 've been doing some further checking that suggests there might be still more to the story . " " Oh ? " " There seems to be some kind of a network of people involvedon both sides of the Atlantic . For instance , Fermi and Teller are both at Columbia University in New York . Another Hungarian , called Szilard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official staff , but lives in a hotel along the street . Now , he was previously engaged in similar work in England . One of the people whom he worked with was a Professor Lindemann , who is a personalfriend of Churchill 's and also his most trusted scientific advisor . " ' Ah , so Der Liigenlord appears in the picture , does he ? " Piekenbrock murmured . " Lying Lord " was the German newspapers ' latest term to describe Churchill . He was also referred to widely by his initials , WC , which were written on the door of every German toilet . " Lindemann spent some years here in Germany , and he and Szilard were mixed up in getting Jewish scientists out of the country , " Boeckel went on . " Now Lindemann has moved into Churchill 's Admiralty headquarters in London . Einstein stayed at Churchill 's Chartwell mansion when he was in England in 1933 . Einstein and Szilard were colleagues in Germany . Teller was there , too , at the time . He met Fermi in Italy before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names keep appearing . They 're linked in some kind of pattern , hut I have n't managed to interpret it yet . "  |p244Piekenbrock  halted at a junction in the path . Boeckel waited . A short distance away , an old woman was struggling to haul a wooden sled carrying a sack of coal , while a small boy pushed in the snow behind . Coal was the worst of the shortages that winter . Reportedly tens of thousands of homes in Berlin were without heating at all . " If they are all part of such a network , then our American friends would no doubt stop off at England on the way , would n't they  --  to coordinate with the Churchill end of the operation ? " Piekenbrock said at last . " Very probably , " Boeckel agreed . Piekenbrock nodded slowly . " I 'd like a special watch kept for them at the places they might be expected to appear  --  Churchill'snaval headquarters in London , for example , " he said at last . " It would be a useful confirmation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they 're up to . " He paused . " How much of our work on uranium is going on at the KWI ? Is it concentratedthere , or are things going on at other places , too ? " " It 's a confused situation , " Boeckel said . " The KWI people are working under a Professor von Weizsacker , with support from the War Office . But there 's another professor , called Esau , who 's running a setup for the Education Ministry over on Linden , and the Ordnance Department has something going at Gottow . It 's not clear how all the pieces fit together . Sometimes , I think it 's easier to find out what the enemy 's doing than these infernal bureaucracies of ours . " " Well , get a picture together of what 's happening , and especiallywhere , " Piekenbrock said briskly . " I 'd like a list drawn up of the major centers where work is in progress on this uraniumbusiness . If we do get wind that those Americans are on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what their potentialtargets might be . " " I 'll begin at once , sir . " " You 've done some good work , Boeckel , " Piekenbrock complimented . " Keep it up . You should go a long way . . . . Oh , and I trust that things are under control concerning that matter to do with your secretary ? " A puzzled frown crossed Boeckel 's face . " She 's gone , sir . She was transferred to Hamburg . " " She was ? " Piekenbrock managed to look genuinely surprised . " Oh , yes , I 'd forgotten . Well , behave yourself with her re-placement . " " That wo n't be difficult , " Boeckel said glumly . " They 've given me a hag who 's at least fifty . She 's as fat as a carthorse and has bad breath . "  |p245Piekenbrock  strolled on , admiring the patterns of snow on the trees and avoiding his subordinate 's suspicious glances . " Did they really ? Oh well , these things happen , I suppose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 , an incident occurred that had not taken place in the Proteus team 's universe : Two German officers made a forced landing at Menchelen , in Belgium , after their plane strayed off course . They were carrying copies of the German plan of attack in the West , which took the form of a thrust through the Low Countries as the Allied commanders had anticipated , and which the Proteus team 's history confirmed . The German planning staff had been urging Hitler to delay the attack because of the continuing atrocious weather  --  again , a departure from events in the Proteus universe , where conditions had been less severe . With the loss of the plans , Hitler conceded and ordered the campaign in the West to be postponed until spring . Hitler also decided that adhering to the captured plan would be too risky and called for a new one to be drawn up . He began paying close attention to a scheme that General von Manstein , the new commander of the XXXIII Army Corps , had been urging for a fast-moving armored thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of attack . The French considered the area impassable to tanks and had n't committed much of their strength to its defense . Even if the Germans did attack in that region , the French reasoned , they would need six or seven days to bring up their heavy artillery  --  ample time for the French reserves to move into covering positions . Von Manstein agreed with these calculations . Therefore , he was n't proposing to use heavy artillery ; he would use groundattackbombers , instead.  |p246DIVING  AND THE USE of scuba equipment were part of the basic training of all Special Operations troops ; so were parachuting , skiing , mountaineering , and travel across all types of terrain from arctic icefields to tropical jungles  --  in short , just about every means available for carrying warfare to an enemy . Furthermore , Paddy Ryan , in an another coincidence that Winslade refused to comment on , had previously been an instructor at the Navy 's Underwater Reconnaissance &; Demolition training base in Florida . Hence , none of the Ampersand group who arrived at the submarine school in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks , wet suits , dry suits , or underwaterbreathing apparatus . After a day 's practice to refresh basic skills , therefore , they were able to devote the rest of the time to the main object of their stay at Portsmouth : learning to use the the special equipment , both consignments of which had arrived safely from New York via Liverpool . Each suit consisted of an inner and an outer garment . The body-hugging inner was made of soft sponge rubber to trap bubblesof insulating air close to the skin , covered by a layer of treated flannel . The outer was a hooded , tight-fitting suit made from double-thickness oilskin impregnated with paraffin wax.  |p247The  design was based on underwater dress as it had developed by the 1970s , but with the added features of gloves and overgauntletsattaching at watertight wrist seals , tighter-sealing face masks , and hard outer helmets , colored for ease of identification . The aims were not only to prevent all contact with the surroundingmedium and to afford good heat insulation , but also to minimize the spread of liquid inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which fluid under pressure could penetrate even a pinhole was surprising . And if the contents of the mineshaft were corrosive and somebody suffered a major gash ? Well , that was one of the reasons why the person picked as medical officer , Ed Payne , just happened to have specialized in chemical burns . Unlike regular scuba gear , which supplied compressed air from backpack tanks , respiration was effected by means of an oxygen rebreathing system worn on the chest , far less bulky and unlikely to prove a hindrance in confined spaces . In addition , the suits were equipped with saturated magnetic-reactor telephones , which required no cords and functioned like radios up to distancesof a few hundred feet ; they were compact and required no electronics or heavy batteries . Some of the concepts employed were novel by the standards of 1940 ; for example , one-piece face masks instead of goggles that squeezed eyes uncomfortably at depth , and on-demand regulatorvalves delivering air at the pressure of the working depth to inflate the lungs against the weight of the overlying water . Care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implausible innovations . Thus , any equipment falling into German hands might cause a few raised eyebrows , but it would be unlikely to arouse further suspicions . " Well , the way I figure it has to be is like this , " Cassidy said , sitting forward and lifting his leg onto one of the cross-girders to adjust part of his harness . " You know what Kurt said about all these universes branching off from each other every time an atom flips its lid , or whatever he said they do ? " " Uh-huh . " Ferracini , clad in his own suit except for its face mask , leaned out from their perch on the steel-lattice gantry spanning the top of the fifty-foot-deep escape tank , and looked down at the muddy brown surface of the water six feet below . Major Warren and Captain Payne were on a wider platform in the middle of the gantry , from which a set of lines disappeared down to where Lamson and Ryan were demolishing obstructions at the bottom . The water in the tank had been dyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaft at Weissenberg , and the team was having to learn to work by feel and communi/cate via a system of touch signals instead of the diver 's usual hand signs . Payne had commented that the color was appropriate to Claud 's quip about armadillos . And every universe is a possible version of what might have happened , somehow different from all the others , " Cassidy went on . Ferracini nodded . " That 's the way it sounded to me , any-how . " " Okay , so once two branches divide and go separate ways , they can never merge again , right ? In other words , once two versionsof a past exist that are different in some way , they ca n't lead you to the same future , okay ? " " I du n no . . . . Well , maybe . . . . What is this , Cassidy ? Since when have you  --  " " Shuddup a minute , Harry , this makes sense . Now  --  " " Well , excuse me . " " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machine that sends people or a message  --  anything  --  back into the past , it has to create a new branch  --  in fact , a whole new tree of branches that begins right at the instant that the whatever-it-is appears . Now , all of those new branches have to be different from the line that was already there and led to the future that the whatever-itiscame from . They have to be different because they 've got a whatever-it-is on them  --  like a machine in Germany back in 1925 , for instance  --  that the line that was already there does n't have . Therefore , anyone who comes back through that machine ca n't do anything to change what 's on the line that was already there because the line he 's on now  --  the new line  --  leads someplaceelse up the new tree . " " Wait a minute . . . " Ferracini held up a hand while he thought over what Cassidy said . " Okay , so . . . " He stopped , and his eyes widened . Cassidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . Overlord must have known at least that much , seeing as how they figured out the original system and all that . So , any idea of them thinking they could change their own situation by setting up Hitler to take out the Soviets is baloney . They 'd have known that nothing they did could change anything to do with where they were at . " " So what did Overlord think they were achieving ? " Ferracini asked , puzzled . Cassidy shrugged . " All I can think of is that they did n't figure they 'd change their own universe , but set up a new one that suited them better . Then they 'd pack their bags , move in , and take it over . "  | " You mean after Hitler had gotten rid of the Soviets and set it up for them ? " " Exactly  --  except that he had other ideas and shut down his end of the connection before they made their move . " And that was where the world he had grown up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slowly , a frown crept over his face as he thought about what it meant . " Are you saying that Claud must have known about it , too  --  that he 's been holdingout ? " " Either that or he got it wrong , " Cassidy said . " Claud does n't usually get too much wrong . " " That 's what I figured . " " But if Claud knew , then ... " " If he knew , then he 'd have known also that the same applied to our universe , " Cassidy completed . " Nothing we do here can change the situation that JFK and the rest of them are in back there . All we can affect is the future of the branch we 're on now . " On the platform behind them , Payne said something into his telephone and looked over his shoulder at Warren . " Ryan says they 're done . They 're coming back up now . " Ferracini and Cassidy collected tools and other items in preparation for going down next . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claud had the same idea  --  our world had no future worth talking about , so he decided to transfer to another one that had more going for it ? " " If you were him , which one would you rather retire in ? " Cassidy asked . " I 'll tell you when I 've got a better idea where this one 's lead-ing . " " But at least it 's got chances . See my point ? " Ferracini stood up and thought about it while he fastened lines , knife , and tool belt , making sure that everything was tied and buckled such that it could be released instantly if it got caught in something . " So how come he never told anybody ? " he said at last . Cassidy spread his hands in a what-else-do-you-expect ? gesture . " If we 're stuck here , we 're stuck , but if it does turn out to be true , how many of us honestly feel now that it would be such a lousy deal ? We 've had a year to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot worse . Now that we 're all adjusting , Claud does n't talk too much about Gatehouse , anymore  --  had n't you noticed ? He talks about Hammerhead . See what I mean ? It 's what happens to this world that he 's interested in , not the one we came from . " " Einstein and all those scientists back there with Mortimerp250and Kurt  --  are you saying it was all a waste of time from the start ? Claud knew it was ? " " I 'm not sure , " Cassidy admitted . " But let me ask you this : Would you have had anything to do with this mission if you 'd known for a fact before we left that it was gon na be a one-way ticket ? " At the end of the week , Winslade came down from London to see how things were going . He showed up looking like a **25;14252;TOOLONG squire , in checked tweed suit , complete with topcoat , shoulder-length cape , deerstalker hat , and smoking a curved briar pipe . He announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of January , after all . The improvement in Allied resolve might be part of the reason ; the weather could have something to do with it . Nobody was sure . But in any case , the Allied plan was to meet a German thrust as far forward as possible by advancing into Belgium at the first sign of a German move westward . There was a lot of popular support for Finland , still putting up a good fight against the Russians . The Norwegian and Swedishgovernments , however , were balking at the thought of grantingthe Allies passage to render any aid . The British , for their part , now that war had come , had no qualms at the implied prospect of fighting the Soviet Union in addition to the Nazis . " They 've taken the view that Stalin is as bad as Hitler , and if they 're going to get rid of one , they might as well get rid of the other while they 're at it , " Winslade said . That the opposition the British were talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tiny island did n't seem to bother them at all.  |p251ON  THE LAST DAY of January , the scientists at Gatehouse again made a crude contact with the 1975 system by establishing what Scholder described as a " partial resonance . " This happened five weeks after the first occurrence , which had taken place on Christmas Eve . There had been delays in getting some of the redesignedcomponents delivered ; others had had to be scrapped and reordered , and progress in general had not been spectacular . Scholder repeated his attempt to attract attention at the far end by morse transmission , but nothing new was accomplished . Greene telephoned the news to Winslade as a matter of course , and Winslade asked to be informed immediately of any further developments . In Europe , the German assault in the West that had overwhelmedFrance and led to Britain 's defeat in the previous universefailed to materialize . By the end of the first few days of February , those with inside knowledge who had been anxiously following the situation concluded that the invasion was n't coming . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results and altered the course of history for the better . Reassured and emboldened , Churchill and his followers stepped up their pressure for action to forestall the Nazi movep252into Scandinavia , which in the Proteus world had taken place in May . Accordingly , on February 5 , the Allied Supreme War Councildecided upon intervention in Norway . The plan adopted followedclosely the lines that Winslade had outlined at Churchill 's flat in November , namely that the public justification would be to aid Finland , while the government would believe that the real objective was to cut off Germany 's iron-ore supply from Sweden . On February 16 , the British destroyer Cossack , acting on directorders from Churchill , sailed into a Norwegian fjord to apprehendthe German ship Altmark . Although the Norwegians were supposed to have searched the Altmark and had reported negatively , Admiralty intelligence held that the ship carried Britishseamen taken prisoner by the German pocket battleship Graf Spee , which had later scuttled itself after being cornered by Britishand New Zealand warships in the South Atlantic in December . A boarding party from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their release , causing immense satisfaction and jubilation among the British public  --  and to hell with whatever international law had to say about it . The incident also provoked concern among the German high command , who were under no delusions about the pretext of Alliedaid to Finland . If the British had n't hesitated to violate Norwegianterritorial waters for something as inconsequential as freeing a few prisoners , the Germans reasoned , surely they would be at least as likely to shrug off Norwegian neutrality for the far greater prize of denying Germany its ore supplies . Accordingly , the Chief of the German Navy , Admiral Raeder , began pressing Hitler to move the date for the Norway invasion forward . Meanwhile in England , after three more weeks of wriggling and squeezing through Derbyshire caverns , rappelling down slipperyropes into flooded mines in Cornwall , and working blind in watery , slime-filled blackness , the Ampersand team was recalled to London for a further briefing session in the vaults below AdmiraltyHouse . " Your Spanish visas have been fixed by nameless people at the U.S. State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handed two American passports across the desk for Ferracini and Cassidy to inspect . Winslade had acquired himself a permanent office at the Admiralty and was back in his British Navy uniform . " They 'll get you from Paris to Madrid . From there , you fly to Rome as Joe Hennessey and Pat Brewster  --  a news reporter and sound engineer both with CBS , traveling together for a planned broadcast from the Vatican reviewing the first year of the new papacy . Italy is on good terms with thep253Franco regime after the aid that Mussolini sent in the Civil War , and travel on that route is n't too restricted . " Cassidy studied his passport carefully . ' And if anybody checks , the CBS office in Rome will confirm they 're expecting these guys to show up ? " he queried . " Of course . " In a chair beside Cassidy , Ferracini examined the ID card , travel permit bearing official French and Spanish stamps , and other documents that Winslade had produced , all conjured up by a clandestine section of the MI6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where appropriate , they had been given a worn and aged look . " It says here that we sail to France direct from New York this week , " he remarked . Winslade opened a folder and began laying a series of items out on the desk . " Copy of a New York Herald Tribune from last Monday to put in your briefcase . . . two theater ticket stubs from Saturday  --  Broadway . . . dated receipt for shirts and pants from menswear store on Third Avenue . . . letter from wife to hotel address in Paris , postmarked Bensonhurst , Long Island , with snapshots of children  --  congratulations . " Ferracini studied them briefly one at a time and nodded . It went without saying that all their clothes , shoes , pocket contents , and personal belongingswould include nothing of British origin . Lindemann , sitting on a couch by the wall , was the only other person present this time . Each of the three pairs making up the Ampersand operation would be told only their own cover identities and route into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or under what guises , Warren , Payne , Lamson , and Ryan would be traveling . They did n't even know for sure who would be partnering whom , and therefore , if worse did come to worse , they would be unable even to describe the other pairs involved in the mission . Pairs whose descriptions were known were easier to spot than individuals . " In Rome , you change identities , " Winslade went on . He handed across two files in red binders . " When you arrive , contact the American Consulate . Somebody there will give you instructions for exchanging your documents and belongings for two new sets . The details are given in these files . Memorize them . They 're to be returned before you leave . Basically , you become Niels Jorgensen from Denmark , and Benito Cassalla , an Italian . One of you is a schoolteacher , the other an artist , and you share a commoninterest in classical archaeology . You 've been spending the winter in Italy looking at Roman architecture and ruins  --  you 'll he given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 'll he notes for you to copy in your own hand/writing . You 're returning to Denmark by train via Bologna , Verona , and Munich , with a change to make at Berlin for Hamburgand the Danish frontier . " Winslade spread his hands . " But you never make your connectionin Berlin . You get off the train early , at Leipzig . It will be nighttime , and if you 're stopped at Leipzig station you can say that as foreigners you were confused by the blackout and thought the train had reached Berlin . Wait until the train is just about to leave to make sure you 'll be left stranded , which will be your reason for checking into a hotel for the night . " Winslade looked at Lindemann and raised his eyebrows in an invitation for him to continue . Lindemann cleared his throat . " I will introduce you to someone who 'll be able to fill you in on current details regarding hotel registration , police checks , and so on , " he began . " Now , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square known as the Rathausplatz . One of the streets leading into it is called Kanzlerstrasse , a narrow , cobbled affair with a bierhaus on the corner , under a clock . A short distance along Kanzlerstrasse , you 'll find a shoemender 's with the name Hoffenzollen outside . You 're to go in there and say that you 've come for the shoes that were being heeled for Fraulein Schultz . You should be asked if she has recovered from her cold yet . You are to reply , ' Yes , she 's much betternow . It 's been such a dreadful winter . ' AAnd follow instructions from there on , " Winslade said . " You both know the drill . " Ferracini and Cassidy glanced at each other , but neither of them had any immediate questions . " What about the gear ? " Cassidyasked , looking back at Winslade . " We 've decided against air-dropping it , " Winslade replied . " Instead , it 's being independently routed , in two containers again , each going a different way . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Independently routed " was a trade euphemism . It meant that the equipment would be transported separately by people who were considered more expendable than the six Ampersand specialists . If a container fell into the wrong hands and the peoplehandling it were caught , they would know neither what its contents were nor its ultimate destination ; nor would they know that a second container even existed . If both containers went astray , at least the team would be preserved , with the option to try again later by some other means . Assuming all went well , however , the Ampersand personnel would be able to retrieve the containers once they had been brought to safe drop points by the anonymous " other parties , " asp255Lindemann called them , and after at least one of the Ampersand pairs had found its contact . But as a further precaution , until both conditions were satisfied the containers would not be retrievable . The whereabouts of a container would be represented by a standard six-figure map reference , of the kind that Ferracini and Cassidy were already familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other parties involved would place different small ads in two of the local papers . To anybody who knew how to decipher them , each ad would provide one half of the map reference . The Ampersand people would know which ad to look for in one paper ; their local contact would know which ad to look for in the other paper . Thus , only when the two had met would reconstruction of the complete map referencebecome possible . The second container would be obtained in the same way , but of course the two ads relating to it , and the group of other parties responsible for placing them , would be different . After completion of the mission , escape would be effected via a submarine rendezvous off the Baltic coast . A method of coded telephone calls to the American Consulate in Berlin had been worked out , whereby dates and timings for the rendezvous could be fixed with the British Admiralty via Washington . Departure date would be the end of February . The remaining time until then would be devoted to becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , and all the usual precautionary chores . A knock sounded on the door just as they were finishing up . The naval sentry outside opened the door , and Churchill came in to inquire on progress . The papers that day had applauded his decision to send in the Cossack and said it exemplified the kind of spirit that the government should be showing more of ; he was in a jaunty mood . " They 'd have all ended up in a prison camp if we 'd waited for our illustrious friend to move at his usual funereal pace , " he told them . Churchill 's latest choice epithet for Chamberlain was " The Undertaker from Birmingham . " He waved Ferracini and Cassidy back into their chairs as they started to rise and rubbed his palms together as he stood looking at them . " Well , and how does the plan strike you ? You 'll be the ones more affected by it than anybody . " " It seems . . . very thoroughly worked out , sir , " Ferracini said . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassidy agreed . Churchill nodded , satisfied . ' As the man in Brazil said when asked how his mother-in-law 's remains should he disposed of ,  |p256'Embalm  , cremate , and bury . Take no chances . ' With an enterpriseof this importance , a comparable measure of prudence seemed in order . " Winslade smiled . " Why Brazil ? " he asked . " I have absolutely no idea . That was how I heard it . " " We 'll be talking to the last two of you tomorrow , and then it 'll be hard swotting and memorizing for the rest of the month , " Lindemann said . ' And you feel confident that you can do it ? " Churchill asked , looking at the two young Americans . " Sure , " Cassidy replied , shrugging nonchalantly . If the missionscrewed up , he told himself , whatever he said would have ceased to matter , anyway . Ferracini answered more circumspectly . " The chances look good . Having the unexpected on your side always helps . " " Splendid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know there 's no necessity for me to spell out how much depends on the success of this undertaking . Therefore , I 'll spare you any speeches . But you know , I have a feeling that this venture in cooperationacross the seas will turn out to herald a grand alliance between our countries before this is over . That may sound strange in view of the current climate of isolationism on your side , but things like that can soon change . Did you two know that my mother was an American , by the way ? " They talked until lunchtime , at which point Churchill and Lindemann left to keep an appointment with some admirals to discuss U-boat matters . Winslade had arranged for the rest of them to meet Arthur Bannering and some of the others for lunch . They locked the room , ascended two levels , and went out by the front entrance . " You should be getting used to this London by now , " Winslade said as he trotted briskly down the main steps with Ferracini on one side of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what you 'd seen where we came from , eh ? " " It looks nicer without any of the wrong uniforms around , " Cassidy said . " Say , Harry , do you remember what this building we were just in used to be ? " " Southeast Region Gestapo Headquarters , " Ferracini said . And making sure it does n't become that again is what the mission is all about , " Winslade said as they began walking in the direction of Trafalgar Square . In the single room that he had rented in a dingy office buildingalmost across the street , the man with the telescopic camera removed the plate on which he had snapped the trio coming down the Admiralty House steps and added it to the pile he had been accumulating all morning . He sighed with boredom andp257glanced at his watch as he inserted another slide into the camera . Five more hours , and then a crowded bus home , a supper of pie and chips in the transport cafe down the street , maybe a pint at the corner pub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To think he 'd believed all those stories about a spy 's life of wine , women , fast living , and excitement . He had n't even received the money for the rent and the film yet ! At the end of the month , Ferracini and Cassidy departed by air from Croydon for Paris as scheduled , the other four having already disappeared during the preceding few days for destinationsunknown . A day later , Winslade received an urgent call from New York : Something was happening at Gatehouse again  --  another partial contact with the 1975 machine . It was faltering and intermittent , but this time the scientists were managing to sustain it . Mortimer Greene felt there was a good chance of connectingfully at any time . If a contact with 1975 seemed imminent , everyone agreed that Winslade as head of the Proteus group should be present , all the more so since his task in England was finished for the time being . If need arose , the Ampersand operation could be halted anytime within the next week  --  Ferracini and Cassidy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by similar means in the cases of the others . But the first thing was to get Winslade back to the States as quickly as possible . President Roosevelt had been interested to learn that Anna Kharkiovitch was a historian who had specialized in the politics of the times , and he sent a request via Churchill for her to come over with Winslade . Once more , he arranged for an American military aircraft to be made available for the journey . " Just imagine , dinner with the First Lord of the British Admiraltylast night , and now a personal invitation from the U.S. President , " Anna said to Winslade as a Royal Navy car drove them toward the airport at Hendon , in the northern outskirts of London . " My word , I am becoming popular in this world ! Do you know , I do n't think I 'd mind all that much if we never went back to ours at all . " Winslade smiled and pretended not to notice the pointed look that she flashed at him beneath the joking words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Roosevelt 's just hoping for some campaign tips , I bet . " Anna sighed . " You know , Claud , you have this rare gift for really boosting a woman 's ego . " " Oh , it 's no gift , I assure you . It requires lots of practice . " Anna 's face became serious and distant all of a sudden . " Itp258could mean good news , " she murmured thoughtfully . " Very good news , in fact . " " How come ? " Winslade asked her . " It could mean that , privately , Roosevelt has already decided to run for a third term , " she replied . " Now that , Claud , would really be a change from what we remember , would n't it ? "  |p259WINSLADE  'S FACE WAS SERIOUS as he and Mortimer Greene followedAnna up the steps of the loading dock in the front area of Gatehouse and walked toward the facade of boxes and crates screening the rear of the building . The two plainclothes military policemen who had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report back to the guard commander . " I do n't like it , " Winslade said . " The bumbling amateur businesscould be a clever second cover . You say that documents from Abwehr headquarters were found in his apartment ? That 's enough in itself to make me worry . Canaris is no fool , and he 's got some sharp people working for him . " " Yes , but those documents only dealt with routine matters , " Greene said . " There was n't anything that specifically pointed eitherto us here or to the mission . And if Fritsch were any kind of a professional at all , he 'd never have left even those lying around like that . " " I still do n't like it , " Winslade repeated as they threaded their way toward the hidden door that led into the machine area . " I 'd like to talk to him myself , later . " On their way hack from the airfield , Greene had told them of the man the guards had caught snooping around the building thep260day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had immigrated several years previously . He was being interrogated elsewhere , but a preliminary check had revealed that he was known to the FBI , who had dismissed him as something of a comic figure working outside the regular German espionage services , and probably not worth the bother of apprehending . In fact , American counterintelligence had found him a useful aid to unravelingthe labyrinthine tangle of the Nazi **32;14279;TOOLONG by feeding him planted information and tracing its path through the system . Now it appeared that this assessment might have been dead wrong . If Berlin had gotten wind of what was going on at Gatehouse , the consequences could only be disastrous . The machine area had a busy look ; lights winked , machineryhummed and whirred overhead and all around ; and techniciansworked at readout screens and control panels . Kurt Scholder was standing with Szilard and a technician by a large table covered with charts and papers that had been set up in one of the spaces below the machine . Fermi was tinkering with something in the background , while Colonel Adamson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt at the White House , looked on , along with a lean , sallow-faced man whose face was unfamiliar . Teller was talking to somebody on the walkwayabove . A round of handshakes welcomed Winslade and Anna back . Greene introduced the stranger as Harry Hopkins , a roving presidentialaide who had come from Washington in order to make a report on progress . The feeling of expectancy that hung in the air made elaborate preliminaries seem inappropriate . ' A good flight ? " Scholder inquired . ' As good as could be expected , " Winslade said . " The Ampersand operation ? " " They all left on schedule . " " Still no attack in the West ? " " Nothing . " Scholder nodded and changed to more immediate matters by moving back a pace and raising an arm to indicate the panel behind him . " Here we have a most peculiar situation , which has developed only in the space of the last few hours . We managed to stabilize the conjugate function this morning , and now we 're reading probe resonance harmonics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not low level . " Winslade 's brow creased . " You do n't mean rho-sigma ? " " No , that 's the point . The locking signature is clear and un-ambiguous. "  |p261The  frown on Winslade 's face deepened . He explained in answer to Anna 's questioning look , " It means we 're encountering a probe beam from the other end that 's trying to lock on . But it 's a full-power beam to activate the main transfer gate , not simply the auxiliary communications channel . " He turned to Scholder . " And have you had any luck with the communications side ? " " No . There 's nothing . That subsystem is completely dead . " " How about the beam that 's seeking  --  did you try a lock-on initiation to see if it would work ? " " Not yet . Since you were on your way , we decided to wait until you got here , " Greene said . He looked at Scholder . " Has there been any change in quality ? " Scholder shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threshold . We lost it for fifteen minutes about an hour ago , but it has restored itself since . " " But it could die on us at any moment , " Greene said . From what ' the instruments were saying , the chance was there now to connect the gate through to 1975 . In just a few minutes ' time , perhaps , they might be able to walk into the cylinder a few feet above their heads and be back in their home time . Winslade clasped his hands behind his back and paced a short distance away across the floor . There was really little to think about , but checking one last time for anything he might have missed before committing himself to a decision had long ago become a habit . " This intermittency worries me , Claud , " Scholder called across , reading Winslade 's action as hesitation . " If I could give details of the modifications here to the engineers at the other end , they would be able to make suitable compensations . It would give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it now , Claud , " Anna urged . " If there 's a chance that the Germans might be onto us , we ca n't risk losing even a day . " Winslade turned and came back again , smiling faintly at their anxiety . " Then let 's go for it , " he said . His manner became more brisk . " Okay . Kurt , start priming for lock-on initiation right away . " " I can handle that , " Szilard offered . Winslade raised an eyebrow . Scholder nodded . " Fine , " Winslade said . Szilard moved away to commence organizing the people around the machine . " You 'd better collect your information , Kurt , " Winslade said . He looked at Greene . " I 'll go through with Kurt if we connect , and leave you to carry on in charge here , Mortimer . Anna , you 'd better come with us top262start filling in our political people on what 's been happening here in the last year . " His gaze fell on Harry Hopkins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this era would n't be out of place as a gesture . " Hopkins held up a hand protectively . " Now wait a minute , I 'm just here as a passive observer , remember ? President 's orders . You 're not getting me inside that thing . " Winslade looked at Adamson . " Keith , how would you like to be the U.S.A. 's first ambassador to another time ? " " Not thirteenth ? " Anna queried . " What about us ? " " Depends how you look at it , " Winslade said . " We 're from 1975 . This is 1940 . Nineteen forty is earlier than 1975 . " Adamson was taken aback . " I really do n't know about that . . . . I do n't have any orders that say anything about  --  " " Fiddlesticks , " Winslade said . " Your orders are to facilitateour mission by all the means at your disposal . Well , this facilitates it . Here . . . " Winslade tossed him the briefcase that Scholder had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the steel stairway behind . Adamson shook his head helplessly , then sighed and followed . They climbed the steps and walked along the railed platform flanking the return-gate cylinder to the access port , an opening like a large doorway without a door , leading into the boxlike constructionat the end of the cylinder . In front of the port , the walkwaywidened into a broad platform of steel-mesh flooring , above which a system of pulleys and hoisting tackle hung from overheadgirders : There was no telling what might need to be brought through the gate  --  nuclear bombs , maybe . Winslade positioned himself in the center of the platform , facing the port , and Adamsondrew up uncertainly a pace or two behind him . A minute or so later , Anna and Scholder joined them ; Scholderwas clutching a second briefcase . Fermi appeared with one of the technicians and went over to a local monitor panel that communicatedwith the main control area below , where Greene had remained with Szilard . A group began forming at the back of the platform to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Pegram from Columbia . A hush descended as Fermi and his assistant donned telephoneheadsets and began making adjustments on their panel in response to instructions from the control area below . " Field couplingis established , " Fermi announced . " They 're getting a stronger reading of the section fundamental . " " It 's connecting ! " Scholder whispered , moving closer behind Winslade . " That 's the probe beam centering . " Winslade nodded.  |p263Beside  Scholder , Adamson stared into the blackness of the opening in front of them and licked his lips apprehensively . " It 's locking now , " Fermi said . A sequence of lamps changed color on the panel in front of him , and a display screen switched to a different data format . " Yes , both . . . and positive , " he said in a lower voice , answering something coming over the telephone . " Nine-eight , and eight-eight . . . yes . . . . No , I do n't think so . Very well . " He turned and glanced at the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . We 'll be a minuteor two . " " Typical ! " someone snorted . " But probably best , " Scholder said . The silence was broken only by occasional snatches of voices from below and Winslade whistling through his teeth . Anna stood immobile , staring expressionlessly at the port . Adamson began fiddling nervously with a button of his jacket . The minute or two dragged on endlessly . Then Fermi turned back toward the panel suddenly , nodded his head a couple of times as he began talking into the telephone again , and then announced , " We 're connected ! The loop 's closed . We 're starting to draw power now " Even as he spoke , the others on the platform felt a mild vibration surge through the structure . A dull red glow , like that in a photographic darkroom , illuminated the inside of the port . The chamber beyond it was long , rectangular in section , and bare . " That 's it , " Scholder said . Winslade set his jaw firmly and advanced toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Teller called from behind , and other voices joined in . The four entered the port and went through to the inner chamber . Those left outside clustered togethera short distance back , so they could see in . The glow changed slowly to a uniform orange that filled the chamber as if the air itself were incandescent . The four figures stood motionless , bathed in light . The light became brighter , and the figures seemed to become translucent , as if they were losing substance . The orange became yellow , then a pale blue , and the outlines of the figures disappeared . Violet followed , then black . Finally the subdued red glow returned to reveal . . . nothing . The chamber was once again empty . Three thousand miles away in Italy , the train heading northwardto Germany via the Brenner Pass was thirty minutes out of Rome . " Tickets and papers , please , " the inspector 's voice called along the corridor . " Have all tickets and papers ready . "  | " Papers , papers , always papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green coat grumbled as he fumbled in the bag next to him . Another ten years of the Fascists and we 'll all be living in a desert . They 'll have used up all the trees making their tons of wastepaper . " The woman smiled nervously at the others in the compartment . " Please excuse my husband . We 've had a tiring trip . It makes him irritable . He does n't mean everything he says . " " Better not to say it , then , " the man in the center seat , wearing a business suit , snapped , while the young , sharp-faced woman sitting across from him sniffed disapprovingly and looked away . Ferracini gave the woman in the green coat a reassuringwink as he felt in his inside pocket for the folder containinghis and Cassidy 's documents . Beside him , Cassidy stared silently out the window . The door from the corridor slid open , and the inspector , a big man with a thick black mustache , moved into the compartment . Two young , armed policemen in black uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers of the couple and the man in the center seat in turn , examined them , and handed them back with a grunt . Next came Ferracini and Cassidy 's turn . " Signore Jorgensen from Denmark and Signore Cassalla , " the inspector commented as Ferracini handed him the folder . He scanned the documents quickly . " Was winter in the north too harsh for your friend ? " Ferracini grinned . " If an excuse to go where it 's warmer presentsitself , then take it , " he said in Italian , which he had spoken since childhood . And what excuse did he manage to dig up ? " ' An excellent phrase to pick , " Ferracini said . " We are both archaeologists , you see . We spent the winter in Italy , and now we are going to my friend 's place in Denmark to write our paper . Caesars may turn to dust and the greatest empires end in ruins , but we will never be out of a job . " The remark was intended as a sly dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in situationslike this , Ferracini had learned . People who were too anxiousnot to offend often had something to hide . " Do you speak Italian ? " the inspector asked Cassidy . ' A little only . " " In order . " The inspector handed the folder back . " Perhaps when Hitler has finished with the Maginot Line you will have more ruins to occupy yourselves with . " " Perhaps , " Ferracini repeated neutrally . The papers of the remaining occupants passed scrutiny withoutincident . When he had finished , the inspector backed outp265into the corridor and closed the compartment door . " Tickets and papers , please . Have your tickets and papers ready , " he called out as he moved away . The bearded man took out a cigarette case , and the sharpfacedyoung woman buried herself behind a newspaper . The man in the business suit looked at Ferracini and Cassidy . " I am also an expert in archaeology , " he informed them pompously . " What perioddo you specialize in ? Mine was the Mesolithic in Western Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microliths from that region tell such an interesting story , do n't you think ? " Ferracini groaned inwardly . This was exactly the kind of thing he had been dreading . But before he could say anything , Cassidy turned his head sharply from the window and glared across the compartment , his clear blue eyes blazing . " We would not waste our time on the subhuman cultures of barbarians and savages , " he declared shrilly in German . " The sole origin of human progress lies in the racially pure Germanic ancestral warriortribes uncontaminated by non-Aryan blood , as taught in the official science of the Reich . All else is lies fabricated by Jews and decadent academics to hide their racial degeneracy . They will be exterminated . Heil Hitler ! " The man sat back in his seat abruptly . Oh , they were those kinds of archaeologists , were they , his expression said . " Pardon me , " he said , coldly . And with that he took a book from his pocket and immersed himself in it . Cassidy nodded curtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferracini eased himself back in his seat , exhaled a long breath slowly and silently , and pulled his hat down over his eyes to feign sleep . The white incandescent haze that had enveloped them faded slowly , and solid surroundings materialized . Different surroundings . The inner chamber of the Gatehouse machine was gone , and instead they found themselves standing on a shiny metallic floor inside a much larger space formed by two sides curving together overhead to form a semicircular roof , like a short , high tunnel . The surface was of some milky white substance glowing with an inner light , and formed a ribbed pattern interrupted by metal ring structures at intervals . On either side , gaps along the length of the floor separated it from the walls . The walls continued their curve downward and out of sight below , as if the tunnel were circular in section and the " floor " a platform supported halfway up inside it . Ahead of them , the platform led to a large set of double doors . Behind anp266observation window above the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only stand bewildered . Winslade looked quickly from one side to the other . He seemed puzzled and uncertain . Anna Kharkiovitch frowned as she took in the surroundings , and shook her head uncomprehendingly . " Claud , what is this ? I do n't understand . This is n't the place that we came from in New Mexico . It 's not the machine at Tularosa at all . I 've never seen any of this before . " " But I have , " Kurt Scholder said grimly . " It is n't even the U.S.A. This is Pipe Organ  --  Overlord 's secret installation in Brazil . Somehow we 've arrived in 2025 ! " Ahead of them , the large doors were beginning to slide open.  |p267THE  DOORS SLID ASIDE to reveal a brightly lit antechamber , with smaller doors leading out from either side and another set of larger doors facing from the far end . Higher up , a glass-enclosed gallery looked down from the corner formed by two of the walls , and from it a railed stairway descended to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receding hair was already hurrying down the stairs , followed by another man and a woman . He was wearing a white topcoat over a jacket and light blue shirt , plain at the neck . He looked agitated . As the trio reached the floor , one of the side doors opened and more people spilled out , babbling and gesticulating excitedly . Kurt Scholder 's mind raced to take in the situation . This was the other end of Hitler 's link to the world where the totalitarian state had been masterminded . It was from this place that Overlord'sagents had departed to make contact with the leaders of the discredited Nazi party of 1925 . The timings of transfers in and out of Pipe Organ had always been crucial , Scholder remembered from his time here , thirtyfouryears ago now by the scale of his own bizarre life span . A departure of even a few seconds from the planned schedule had been enough to send the program directors into hysterics , which could explain the pandemonium among the people who were ap/pearing in the antechamber ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sure ; but it might provide the best chance for saving the situation , or at least of preventing its rapid deterioration into a total disaster . He murmured quickly to the others , " Try to split up if we can , temporarily . If we 're all interned and immobilized together , we 'll never get out . I 'll need a diversion when we get among them . They 're used to Nazis  --  confuse them . Bluster . " The tall , bearded man stepped inside the doors and gestured frantically . " Come on ! Get out of the lock . Who are you people ? Where  --  " " We ? " Scholder cut him short with an indignant screech as he and Winslade began marching toward the doors . Behind them , Colonel Adamson hesitated for a split second and then moved hastily to catch up as Anna Kharkiovitch jabbed him in the ribs . " Who are we ? We should be asking who you are if you do n't know us ! What kind of reception is this ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ... . There must be  --  " " Where is Herr Oberkeltner ? " Winslade demanded , bellowingin German . " We were advised that he would be already waiting . He is not . And I do n't see Freidergauss . This is intolerable ! Someone will pay " The four arrivals walked into the antechamber , and a general melee ensued as more figures appeared on the stairs and through the side door . The bearded man turned to another , who was lookingbaffled and turning through sheets of paper in a folder . " What has happened ? " the lean man demanded . " Those names  --  where are they ? " " I 'm sorry , Director Kahleb . . . I do n't seem to see them , " the other man faltered . " This does n't make  --  " " Get them out of the way , " somebody else shouted . " TG297 is nine seconds late already . Mathers , call Control . Start bringing the beam up now . " " I 'm trying . Channel 's busy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use the emergency code ! " " But who are these people ? " " Oh , God , we 're all in for it now . " " Well , they must have . They 're here . The schedule must be in error . " " Impossible , I tell you ! " " What kind of organization is this ? " Winslade screamed at the top of this voice . " Where is the nincompoop in charge ? " Another side door opened and more people appeared , butp269they seemed uninterested in the tumult going on in the antechamber . Two men wearing side arms and dressed in white caps and uniforms of dark gray , satiny material cleared a path to the open doors through which Winslade 's party had just come . Then some more men , a couple in white coats and the rest in unfamiliarstyles of clothing , ushered through a small group wearingthe familiar attire of the 1930s ; this group had evidently been waiting to depart . At that point , the man called Kahleb succeeded in shepherding the others out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near end of the space they were now in was predominantlywhite in color and suggested a reception area of some kind , with soft carpeting , chairs and low tables scattered in clusters , and a counter running along one wall . On the opposite side were several seats facing video stations that resembled computer work terminals . Farther back , an open partition of shelves and colored designs screened the rear area , which looked more like an instrumentation room . It had lots of wall panels and electronicscubicles , and the farthest part , occupying the lower section of a split-level floor , seemed to form a windowed bay looking out over a vaster space of machinery and activity below . Still waving his hands and protesting loudly , Winslade marched to the center of the floor with Anna . Adamson moved instinctively to follow , but Scholder caught his sleeve . Winslade and Anna became the focal point of attention , drawing the tide of people around them . Scholder nudged Adamson closer to a door near one end of the counter . " Will you kindly calm down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last losing patience with Winslade 's ongoing tirade . " Carrying on like this wo n't resolve anything . " " Who do you think you are to talk to me like that ? " Winslade shouted back . " My name is Kahleb , and I am responsible for Section F-1 , Transfer Operations Control . I  --  " " Well , you very soon wo n't be ! I want to talk to the ControllerGeneral . " " This is outrageous . I  --  " " I insist ! " Winslade walked over to one of the terminals and stooped to hammer something into its touchboard . The screen flickered for a moment , and every eye in the room was drawn irresistibly to see what would appear on it . " Now , " Scholder hissed , and pushed Adamson through the door next to them . They were in a small room with a sink and faucets , refrigerator , coffee maker , several food closets , and a stack of boxes.  |p270Another  door opened out the far side . Scholder waved Adamson on through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short corridorsof bare concrete walls . There were iron stairs going up and down , more doors in every direction , and an elevator just a few feet away . But they had n't covered enough distance to be able to risk waiting . Instead , Scholder led the way downstairs for one level and pressed the call button there . The elevator was of the kind that had doors on two sides-as Scholder had probably known already and Adamson was beginning to realize . They stepped in , but instead of selecting a floor , Scholder opened the opposite door and let them out the far side . Then , as the doors were starting to close again , he reached back in to send the elevator up . At that instant , the noise of a door bursting open came from upstairs , followed by excited voices . Scholder and Adamson walked quickly away , turning a couple of times into more passageways , and came to another elevator . At this one they went down . " I 'm the one who should be concerned , Keith , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the car lurched into motion . " This is literally back where I came in . " Adamson pulled himself together with an effort . " I 'll file a complaint when we get back . " " The advisability of that might depend on where we get back to . " " Assuming we ever get back anywhere . " After a pause Adamsonsaid , " That was pretty quick thinking , Kurt . I 'm impressed . But where do we go from here ? " The elevator stopped , and the door opened . Scholder held up a restraining hand while he peered out . Then he motioned Adamsonquickly across the landing and opened a door . The inside was pitch black and noisy , and a gust of warm air came out . Scholder switched on the light to reveal a room full of motors , compressors , air circulation equipment , and ducting . Some shelves stood near the door with buckets , brushes , and cleaning aids . There was a small handcart like those used by janitors , and next to it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied grunt as he took out a grimy oversmock . " You 'll be all right in here for a few minutes , " he said as he pulled the smock on over his suit . " I 'm going to try to get us some better clothes . Our own are too conspicuous . " And then what ? " " Then we pay a visit to someone who might be willing to help us . " " Who ? " " Oh , in a way you already know him , " Scholder replied . Hep271put a couple of bottles of cleanser and some rags on the handcart and pushed it onto the landing . He smiled mysteriously , closed the door on Adamson 's puzzled frown , and walked away pushing the cart . Scholder reached the metalworking and machine shops on the lower levels of the complex a few minutes later and entered the changing room outside the washroom and showers . Two men were talking by the staff lockers , and Scholder fussed around in the background with a bottle and cleaning rag until they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found enough of them unlocked to provide a mix of garments that he judged to be his and Adamson 's sizes , choosing baggy and loosefittingitems to allow a margin of error . He dropped the clothes into his cart , bundled up a couple of white work coats and stuffed them in on top , and a few seconds later was on his way to rejoin Adamson . They changed silently in the cramped space of the machineryroom and emerged as passable imitations of bona fide PipeOrganworkers , provided no one looked too closely at the photographs on the badges pinned to their work coats . After they had reentered the elevator , Scholder pressed a button to take them back up several levels . As the car commenced moving , a grille overhead in the ceiling announced , Attention . Attention . Unauthorized persons are at large in the Security Area . All personnelare to return to their assigned work stations immediately for security checking . All personnel to assigned stations . Repeat ... " " We were just in time , " Scholder murmured . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few min-utes . " The car stopped , and they came out into a wide , carpeted hall with potted plants and pastel walls . Figures were hurrying this way and that between corridors leading away in different directions , and to one side some people came out of an adjoining elevator at almost the same time . " What 's it all about , any idea ? " one of them asked . " Have n't a clue , " Scholder said , sounding irritable . " What 's it ever about ? They 're probably springing another drill on us . " " Typical ! It 's only Security that never has anything better to do around this place . " More of the gray-uniformed guards appeared and fanned out to position themselves by the elevators . " Hurry up , " one of them told Scholder and Adamson . " You heard the announcement . " Scholder nodded and walked briskly away , with Adamson tagging along and doing his best to look as it he knew where hep272was going . They went past a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of laboratory benches , experimental equipmentwith lots of gleaming metal and glass , desks , computer stations , and partitioned-off offices . Unhesitatingly , Scholder led the way through the maze of shoulder-high screens and glasswalledclean-rooms to the door of one of the corner offices . He crashed in without slackening pace and signaled in the same movement for Adamson to close the door behind them . Two desks were inside , facing each other by the far wall . The man sitting at one of them looked up with a start . " What the hell ? ... " Another man , who was standing and had been about to put something in the drawer of a table behind the other desk , wheeled around . " Who are you ? " he demanded indignantly . " Did n't you hear the alert ? You should n't be here . What section are you from ? " Scholder smiled reassuringly . " Not so tense , my friend , " he said . " You should take things more easily , like Eddie here . " The man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , and had a rounded , open face with wide , pale eyes and sandy hair . Beside him , a screen displayed rows of mathematical symbols . " How do you know who I am ? " he asked suspiciously . " I do n't know you . " " Do n't you ? " Scholder looked amused . Eddie stared at him for a second or two , then shook his head . " No . " Scholder turned his head toward the younger of the pair , who was still standing . He was wearing a white sweater with dark pants and had sharp , intense features , straight , wiry black hair , and a thin , obstinate mouth  --  definitely German in appearance . " When you were seventeen , you had a skiing accident on the Dente Blanche , which left a distinctive scar on your left forearm and upper arm . " Scholder glanced at Eddie . " Did you know about that ? " " No , I did n't , " Eddie sounded mystified . " Why ? What does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the younger man . " Your sleeve  --  show us that scar . " " Why should I ? First I want to know who the hell  --  " " Please . " The word was a command , not a request . The man hesitated , then nodded and pulled back the sleeve of his sweater to reveal an L-shaped pattern of scar tissue . " Satisfied ? Now would you mind explaining ? " In reply Scholder pulled back the sleeve of his own coat , un/buttoned the cuff of his shirt , and turned it back . The same scar was there , faded somewhat by thirty-four more years of wear , tear , and living , but unmistakable . " You see , I , too , am Kurt Scholder , " he said . " This used to be my office when I worked for you , Eddie  --  or at least , another versionof you . And yes , I have to admit that we are the ones responsiblefor the excitement . We need your help to conceal ourselves until after the security check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the gaping copy of the person he had once been . " I 'm sure you 'll cooperate , Kurt . I am you , after all . And you would n't want to get yourself into trouble , now , would you ? "  |p274LEIPZIG  HAD NOT YET become the city that Harry Ferracini remembered from the early 1970s of his own world . In that world , the promises of glory , affluence , and power that had intoxicated the German people and dulled their senses while the Nazis were taking over the nation had long been forgotten . Instead of fulfillingtheir destiny as the proud and noble Master Race , they had awakened from their stupor to find themselves slaves to a ruthless , self-proclaimed elite wielding a total monopoly of authorityand power . Subscribing to no code of ethics , the members of that elite had been subject to no restraint except loyalty to their kind . Free to command the labor of defenseless peoples and to plunder the resources of entire nations through the unchecked use of terror , they had lived with their courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caesars , while the childrenof the craftsmen who built their palaces starved in rags . Thus , the Nazi leaders had inherited the utopia that Overlord sought to recreate . But the beginnings of it all were there already Ferracini could see as he and Cassidy walked slowly , hands in pockets , through the streets in the full light of morning . He could see it in the Nazi flags hanging from the windows ; in the youths in brownshirtuniforms with swastika armbands , swaggering through thep275crowd , their jackboots crunching on the cobbles , their thumbs hooked jauntily in belts with silver-eagle buckles ; and in the boarded-up shops with Jewish names overhead . And the fear  --  fear of ever-watchful police ; fear of never knowing which relative , neighbor , or workmate might be an informer ; fear of arbitrarysearch and arrest , interrogation on a whim , internment without trial  --  that was there already , too , in the faces of the people . Cassidy stretched as they walked . " You know , Benito , I 'll never complain about the seats on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half in that goddam train ! What were they doing at all those stops , changing the boiler ? Anyone would think there 's a war on . " " It 's not the seats . You 're too long and lanky . I 've always said you 're too long . " " It is the seats . Everything 's designed for mutants and amputees . . . . And anyhow , supposing you 're right , exactly what am I supposed to do about it ? " " It 's too late now , Niels . You ended up in the wrong job . You should have gone in for basketball or something . " " Oh , is that so ? And who 'd have saved your neck like I did the last time we were in this city ? " They split up as they came to the Rathausplatz . It was a marketday , and the square was filled with stalls and people . Ferracini stopped to buy a paper at a curbside kiosk , while Cassidy crossed the street and wandered around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite the bierhaus with the clock over its entrance as Lindemann had described . From there he could observe the whole square and see along the winding , cobbled lane that a sign confirmed was Kanzlerstrasse . Ferracini came into the square on the far side a minute or so later and walked slowly along the shopfronts to the bierhaus . He turned the corner into Kanzlerstrasse and had followed its single narrow sidewalk for only a short distance when he saw the shoemender'swith the sign " Hoffenzollen " ahead of him on the opposite side . It was a small place with a protruding gable , whirly leaded windowpanes , and paint flaking from its green door . Ferracinicould see nothing unusual or suspicious . Even so , he kept walking to the next corner and stopped there to stamp his feet in the slush , beat his arms across his chest , and take a quick look around . Then he turned and retraced his steps . He could see nobody loitering without obvious reason ; there was no sign of anyone watching the shop from across the street ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the street . In his doorway across the marketplace , Cassidy raised ap276hand to his mouth and yawned . It meant that no one had followedFerracini up the street . Satisfied , Ferracini crossed and entered the shoemender 's . The door creaked , and a bell tinkled overhead . It was dark inside after the daylight , and the smell was a mixture of mustiness and leather . Ferracini 's eyes adjusted after a few seconds , and he made out a battered wooden counter with shelves behind it stacked with used shoes , a rack carrying polishesand laces , and an empty display case  --  under war regulations , real leather had disappeared for the duration . He registered a hammer , a knife , and some shears lying together on one of the shelves , and a faded picture of horses in a frame with cracked glass hung on the wall opposite the counter , behind the door . A corner bureau was stuffed untidily with envelopes and papers . The calendar above it still showed January . The sound of a tool being tossed down onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by somebody belching and a heavy shuffling of feet . Then a giant of a man appeared , with black , unkempt hair and a thick ragged beard that gave him a wild look . He was wearing a leather apron , and his rolled-up shirtsleeves revealed massive forearms ending in two hams of fists that looked as if they could have crushed house bricks . His lips were drawn back , uncovering strong , even teeth that seemed to shine in the gloom . He dragged a leg as he moved . " Good morning , " Ferracini greeted . The giant placed two palms on the counter , raised his chin in a silent query , and waited . " I , ah . . . I believe you have some shoes being heeled for Fraulein Schultz , " Ferracini said . " I was told they should be ready about now . " " Fraulein Schultz , eh ? " " Yes . " " You are a friend of hers ? I do n't know you . " " I 'm a friend of a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The giant stared at Ferracini expressionlessly for a few seconds . " One moment . " He turned and shuffled back into the workshop . More sounds followed . Then Ferracini caught the faint click that only a trained ear would have recognized as a revolver being cocked . Ferracini moved instantly and flattened himself against the wall out of a direct line from the doorway . He felt along the shelf behind him , and his fingers closed around the hammer and the knife . And how is the Fraulein ? " the giant 's voice inquired from beyond the doorway . " Has she recovered from her cold yet ? "  | " Yes , she 's much better now , " Ferracini called back . " It 's been such a dreadful winter . " Ferracini 's ears followed the hammer being released , the safety catch reengaging , and the gun being returned to its hiding place . By the time the giant reappeared , Ferracini was standing nonchalantly behind the counter again . The giant put down a pair of lady 's boots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Go to the address on the ticket tonight , after eight , " he said , keeping his voice low . " You will be collected there . You did n't leave your bags at the hotel , I hope ? " " No  --  a luggage locker at the station . " " Good . Leave me the tags . " The luggage had served its purpose . Ferracini and Cassidy would have no use from now on for clothes purchased in Italy . " Thank you . " And good luck . " Ferracini rejoined Cassidy a few minutes later a block away on the far side of the square . " It looks okay , " Ferracini said . " I 've got a pickup address for tonight . Until then we 've got the rest of the day to kill . " A movie ? " Cassidy sighed . " I guess so . Any idea what 's on ? " " You would n't believe it . " " What ? " Cassidy gestured , and Ferracini turned to find a billboard behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adventure in China with Clark Gable . " Now all theyMeanwhile , over a hundred miles to the north , near the town of Kyritz , Inspector Helmut Stolpe of the local Gestapo was standing in the charge room of the area Security Police Headquarters . A half-dozen or so uniformed SS men and a couple of SD ( the intelligence branch of the SSA were standing around smoking and talking , while in the back of the room behind the desk the 1'ulizeifiihrer shouted into a telephone . The sounds of vehicles stopping , feet clattering , and a voice barking orders came from outside. need is yellow cabs and Max 's place just along the street . " Ferracini 's mind flashed back across a million light-years of trains , planes , English winters with submarine schools and army assault courses , London buses , and U.S. Army Air Corps bombers over the Atlantic , to the lights and sounds of Broadway and SeventhAvenue . All of a sudden , somehow , he wished Cassidy had n't said that.  |p278The  young man standing next to Stolpe in an **26;14313;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked haggard after the activity of the previous night , with tangled hair , a stubbly face , and the front of his tunic unbuttoned . He drew nervously on a cigarette as he talked . " But I 've been there , and you have n't . You do n't know what Heydrich 's Einsatzgruppen are doing in Poland . The people do n't know . Even the Army does n't know . Nobody tells them . They all think we were sent there to stop saboteurs and partisans in the rear . But it 's not true . They 're killing anyone they think might be capable of organizing  --  teachers , doctors , unionists  --  thousands of them . And the Jews ... " Stolpe was unimpressed . " You should know better than to talk like that , " he growled . This kind of softness had lost the last war . He was offended at finding traces of its contamination among the SS of all groups  --  the elite whom Himmler had selectedto become the new order of Germanic knights . " Were you cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The sergeant took no notice . " Old people , cripples , women with babies . . . We made them strip there in the snow , and we shot them down into the pits with machine guns . Thousands of them . . . day after day ... " " That 's enough , " Stolpe snapped . " Were n't you taught that the State embodies the will of the People , and therefore whatever the State does is legal ? Go away and think about how many Germansdied because of traitors and scum in the Great War . This time it will be different . " He caught sight of one of the security officers beckoning him from the door that led through to the rear of the building . " I have things to do . If you take my advice , Sergeant , you 'll learn to control that tongue of yours . Schooldays are over now " Making a mental note to recommend that somebody talk to the sergeant 's commanding officer , Stolpe walked across to the security officer and was ushered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the near end and farther back led to cells . The security officer indicated the medical room , and Stolpe entered to find an SS major and second lieutenant watching while a policedoctor and an assistant stood by the table in the middle of the room , examining the first of the four bodies that had been brought in a half-hour earlier . " What happened ? " he asked in a neutral voice . From the part of the face that had n't been shot away , he judged the man on the slab to have been middle-aged . One shoulder of his jacket was covered in a mess of congealed blood and tissue mixed with splintered jawbone . The doctor was cutting away the clothingp279while the assistant went methodically through the pockets and laid the contents out on a side-table . " Three of them were spotted receiving something from a small boat at night a couple of days ago near Rostock , " the major said . " The other one joined them later , and they began traveling south with a truck full of turnips . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered on the litters they had been carried in on . Stolpe stooped to turn back the first cover to reveal a teen-aged youth in a blood-soaked overcoatriddled with holes . " Any idea where this boat was from ? " He dropped the cover back . The major shook his head . " It slipped away before anyone could get close . The coast guard was alerted but failed to interceptit . That was why we decided to let the reception party go and keep them under observation  --  to see what they were up to . " He shrugged . " The boat ? From Denmark or Sweden , possibly .. . or maybe even from a British submarine . " The third body was of a man with a mustache ; there was a single neat hole in the side of his head . " And ? " Stolpe prompted . " The instructions were bungled , and some oafs at a road checkpoint about ten miles from here tried to detain them . They turned out to be armed , and they resisted . Two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them pinned down while we were called out . The rest you can see . " Stolpe turned back the fourth cover to find himself looking at the almost serene features of a woman who looked as if she had been quite attractive . Her face , however , seemed unnaturally low down as she lay facing upward ; Stolpe realized it was because her head had no back to it . " She was the last , " the major explained . " Suicide  --  through the mouth . " A shame . " Stolpe replaced the cover and straightened up . And what were they concealing beneath the turnips that was worth so much sacrifice ? " he asked . " Nothing . But the truck had a false bottom . What was inside was interesting . Come and see  --  it 's next door . " The major noddedto the lieutenant to carry on and led Stolpe back into the passage and along to one of the cells . Inside , an SD security officerand Erwin Poehner , Stolpe 's colleague from the Gestapo office , were unpacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The items they had already taken out were arranged on the cell 's two bunks . Stolpe picked up a strange , black , one-piece , hooded garment made from a greasy , rubbery material . He examined it curiously for a while , and then tossed it back down to look briefly at , in turn , some kind of transparent face cover , with valves and tubesp280fitted to it ; a body-harness with peculiar metal cylinders and slings for attaching tools or weapons ; and a kit of heavy underwear . On the other bunk lay a pile of ropes , snaplinks , pitons , and other unidentifiable metal devices in assorted shapes and sizes . " Make anything of it ? " he asked , looking back at Poehner . Poehner shook his head . " I 've never seen anything like some of this stuff . I do n't know if they were planning to join the fire brigade or climb the Eiger . And do you want to know something else , Helmut ? There 's enough explosive in those sacks over there to sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot higher up . " And that , Stolpe told himself , groaning beneath his breath , would mean spending the rest of the day writing up a report and filling in forms about it.  |p281THE  ADDRESS TURNED OUT to be a rowhouse in a shabby workingclassdistrict east of the city center . It was sparsely furnished , and the sole occupant a thin , bespectacled , baldheaded man , who said his name was Dr. Mueller . He effused a dismal cheerlessness that reminded Ferracini of the farmer depicted in American Gothic . He spoke little , and when he did speak , he sounded tense and nervous . Before they started asking questions , no , he did n't know who they were or where they were from , and neither did he want to ; all he knew was that they would be picked up the next morning . What happened afterward was none of his business , and why he was doing what he was doing was none of theirs . Along with ; inevitably , new sets of papers , Mueller provided some clothes appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , necktie , felt hat , and overcoat for Ferracini , and for Cassidy a workman 's leather jacket , shirt , sweater , and corduroy pants . Together they ate a funereal supper of black bread , sauerkraut , and a morsel of sausage and dry cheese apiece . Then , tired from their journey , Ferracini and Cassidy retired to spend the night sharing a straw mattress on the floor in a damp and drafty upstairs room . The place was clearly a " human drop-box , " a transitorylink in the chain . " Mueller " would evaporate as soon asp282they had left , and whatever attempts might be made to trace them to their origins , the trail would end right there . The next day had dragged through to lunchtime before a man in a belted raincoat at last appeared at the front door to collect them , introducing himself as Gustav Knacke . He was short and stocky , with a brisk , chirpy attitude that inspired confidence ; he had black curly hair , a tight mouth upturned at the corners , and dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . His breezy , uninhibited chattiness came as a welcome relief after the austere , silent presence of Dr. Mueller . Knacke worked at the Weissenberg plant , he told them as they drove out of Leipzig in a noisy , smoky Fiat that had seen better days . He was a chemist involved in the development of firefighting and safety equipment . His wife worked as a clerk at the same plant . They would be putting up " Ferdinand " and " Juggler "  --  Knackeknew Ferracini and Cassidy only by their Ampersandcode-names  --  until the time was ready . There would be more clothes at the house to replace the things they had left in their bags . " Gasoline is practically impossible to obtain as a private citizen , but I use the car on company business , " he told them as he drove . " Take these in case we 're stopped . They 're worker 's passes for Weissenberg . You 're a plant maintenance supervisor and an electrician . If anyone asks , we 've been to Leipzig this morning to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts are in the trunk . Here are the receipts . Read them so you 'll know what we 've bought . " " Is that how you 're planning to get us into the plant later ? " Ferracini asked . " Yes . " " So you must be where the six of us come together , " Cassidy said . " That 's right . " Each of the pairs coming into Germany would have its own contact like the shoemender , who would know nothing of where they were bound . Also , no doubt , Knacke did n't know where the bodies that he retrieved from the " drop boxes " had come from . " How about the others ? " Cassidy asked . " Have any of them shown up yet ? " Knacke shook his head . " Not yet . It 's still early , though . But we should n't be talking about that until . . . oh-oh . " Two armed policemen were standing in the road ahead , and another was walking forward with one hand raised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car a few feet away and his two passengers tensed , but the policeman turned awayp283and walked back to rejoin the others . Then they saw they were at a railroad crossing , and vehicles from the other direction had been stopped , too . A minute later , two locomotives in tandem rumbled through , pulling a train of freight cars , followed by flatcarsloaded with shrouded field guns and gray-painted tanks emblazonedwith the black cross of the Wehrmacht . " You see , that 's what we get , " Knacke exclaimed , tossing up his hands . " Swindles , always swindles . Our illustrious Dr. Ley will produce a ' People 's Car ' for under a thousand marks that everyone can afford , the Fiihrer promised . And so they invented a pay-before-you-get-it plan  --  neat , eh ?  --  in which every worker pays five marks a week , or more if they can squeeze it out of you . When you have paid seven hundred fifty marks , then you get your order number that entitles you to a car as soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you get . Nobody has seen a car yet . And the factory that they built with our money at Fallersleben  --  more cars per year than Ford turns out in America , they said  --  is making tanks . " He threw up his hands again . " What good is that to me ? Am I supposed to take my wife shoppingin a tank ? " Ferracini and Cassidy grinned at each other as the car began moving again . Ferracini settled back in the front seat to see where they were . Yes , he knew this area . Some things were as he remembered ; others had changed . Or rather , they had n't changed yet . It was a strange kind of reverse deja vu . Director Kahleb frowned . He was seated at one end of the table in the room upstairs from the reception area , where Winslade and Anna had been taken after Scholder and Adamson 's disappearance a half-hour previously . Nothing was making sense . " If your intentions are as innocent as you make out , why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " I still have n't heard a good answer . " " How should I know without asking them ? " Winslade retorted . " Perhaps they think everyone is insane here . I can see why they might . " The silver-haired man whom Kahleb had summoned held up a hand . " We can go into that when Shelmer arrives , " he said . He looked at Winslade . " Now , getting back to the subject , you say you 've never heard of the Nazis . You 're not with Hitler at all ? " " Hitler ? " Winslade blinked at him with a mystified expression . " You mean Adolf Hitler ? " " Well , of course . Who else ? " " The madman ? But he was assassinated , oh . . . I do n't know how many years ago . What does he have to do with anything ? "  | " How could we be connected with him ? " Anna Kharkiovitch chipped in . " You are from 1940 , " Kahleb said , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't a Reich Fuhrer back there , where you came from ? " " Fuhrer ? " Winslade looked blankly at Anna . " They must mean the Central European Commissar , " she said , doing a good job of sounding as if she were trying to be helpful . " Oh , yes , of course . " Winslade looked back . " That would be Comrade Georgi Yussenklovov . " " So you 're with him , then , " the silver-haired man concluded , nodding in a way that said they had gotten somewhere at last . " No , " Winslade said . There were groans followed by a baffled pause . " Look , " Kahleb said wearily , " let 's start all over again .... " One of the scientists listening from the side of the room turned his head and leaned toward another standing next to him . " This is completely unprecedented , " he whispered . " It should n't have been possible , but it sounds as if we cross-hooked into a wrong universe entirely . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been getting . " The Knackes ' home was a solid , respectable , brick house with a tiled roof and ivy-covered walls , comfortably secluded behindhedges and shrubbery in a quiet area of woods and houses about five miles from Weissenberg . Gustav Knacke said that it had been built by his father , who had been a teacher of theology and philosophy at the University of Leipzig . It seemed the family had a long history in the area . Knacke took them in the back door of the house and started a fire in the living room . They would have to make themselves at home for the rest of the afternoon , he said , since he was expected back at the plant . He would be back later in the evening with Marga , his wife . He cautioned them to stay inside the house , to keep the fire low to avoid advertising that the house was n't empty , and not to answer the door or the telephone . " Neighbors ! " he exclaimed despairingly as he left . " Because their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into other people 's . Fortunately , the houses are far apart around here , and we have lots of trees . But it 's better to be safe . " He shook his head . " They send you cards at Christmas and wish you good morning with a smile on their way home from church , butp285give them half a chance and they 're rushing to get themselves in the good books down at the police station . They bully their servantsand grovel to their bosses . I fear it 's part of the mentality of too many Germans . " Cassidy found a spare blanket in one of the closets , and after taking off his boots , stretched out on the couch in front of the fire and went to sleep . Ferracini had never known anybody with the stamina to go for such lengths of time without rest when the situation demanded , or the capacity for so much sleep when it did n't . He himself felt moody and restless . He prowled about the house , getting his bearings . It was a sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , with paneled entrance hall and stairs , solid furnishings of walnut and oak , and china and glassware in cabinets in the diningroom . The library had floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and a grand piano . There was a music stand near the piano with the score of a Mozart sonata lying open on top , and a violin case was propped against a nearby chair . Ferracini took down some of the books at random and turned idly the pages . Plays and poems  --  Goethe , Schiller , Shakespeare ... Lives of the Great Composers . . . art , history , and gardening . . . . He moved along to another section . Analytic Functions of the Complex Variable ; An Introduction to Differential Geometryand the Theory of Curvature ; Physics since 1900 . . . . And farther on , Eastern Mythology ; A History of Thought . He found himself growing depressed . So much had been created ; so much had been discovered ; but apart from what he 'd learned at school , he had been taught only how to kill and destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledgegained in a lifetime in order to create something that any fool with a hammer could smash in a second . On the face of it , nothing worthwhile should have lasted . Yet the strange thing was that over the ages cities and nations had grown ; works of art and science had accumulated ; civilization had spread . Did n't that say that mankind 's creative and constructive instincts far outweighed its destructive element ? Man 's overriding compulsionwas to build and preserve . The interludes of destructiveness constituted the aberrations . If that was so , then the whole world that Ferracini was from represented the supreme aberration , and he himself was just as much an aberration along with it . The resentment that had never been far below the surface welled up anew as the realization came home to him of just how much he had forfeited to that world and those responsible for shaping it . Now , finding himself face to face with a remnant of the world that had died , the            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
