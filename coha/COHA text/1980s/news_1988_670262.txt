TOKYO  --  With a combination of financial muscle and scientific know-how , Japan ' s largest household-products maker is cautiously entering the U.S. market . Last month , Kao Corp . , Japan ' s largest advertiser and a powerhouse in soaps , toiletries and cosmetics , completed the purchase of Cincinnati-based Andrew Jergens Co. from American Brands Inc . But Kao probably won ' t try to make a big splash in the U.S. soon . Rather than going head to head with Procter &; Gamble Co. or Colgate-Palmolive Co. in a battle over the massive laundry detergent or soap markets , analysts and Kao executives say the company will focus on skin-care products and cosmetics . They see the takeover as a shrewd way for Kao to make its first foray into the U.S. " Jergens has a respectable management and more than 100 years of history , " says Yoshio Maruta , Kao ' s president . " It also has distribution channels . By combining them with Kao ' s scientific knowledge or financial assistance , Jergens will be able to serve U.S. consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of practical , unglamorous , but quality products . In the U.S. , Jergens appeals mainly to a Good Housekeeping magazine type of consumer , says Julie Kanagawa , an analyst with Hoare Govett Japan Ltd . " You wouldn ' t see Jergens ads in Cosmopolitan or Vogue , " she says . " That ' s the tack ( Kao ) has taken here in Japan . " Says Richard Maynard , a research analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in Japan , Kao ' s image is " fairly staid . " The company , which had sales of $3. 77 billion in its year ended March 31 , has succeeded by creating innovative products and then by employing " marketing strength to squeeze all the benefits out of them , " he says . Research and development is considered to be Kao ' s strongest suit . Last year , it put 69 billion yen ( $522. 7 million ) into capital expenditures , up 24% from the previous year . The payoffs from this level of investment were obvious last year with Attack  --  an " enzymatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming out of nowhere to give Kao a 40. 5% share of Japan ' s detergent market , up 7. 1 percentage points from the year before . The focus on R &; is similarly trumpeted with Kao ' s Biore line of skin ceams and its Sofina cosmetics , both of which are expected to be broadly marketed in the U.S. eventually . Ms. Kanagawa says Sofina is marketed with the emphasis on skin care as science . Whether or not Kao ' s products actually represent scientific breakthroughs , the company has been able to successfully market them in Japan by sheer weight of advertising dollars . According to Tokyo-based Dentsu Inc. , the world ' s biggest ad agency , Kao spent 35. 4 billion yen on advertising in its last fiscal year , putting it ahead of Toyota Motor Corp . , Nissan Motor Co . , Honda Motor Co. and Lion Corp . , Kao ' s major competitor in some lines . Last year , Kao ' s profit was 13. 247 billion yen , up 22. 5% from 10. 811 billion yen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jergens acquisition , which has been estimated at between $250 million and $300 million , substantially higher than competing bids by U.S. companies . Kao ' s willingness to pay a premium for Jergens fits the pattern of other recent Japanese acquisitions in the U.S. , analysts say . Faced with the choice of building a production base and distribution network from the ground up , many Japanese companies have opted to buy U.S. companies instead . Fortified by the strong yen , they are even willing to pay prices that U.S. bidders consider too high . For the moment , Dr. Maruta says , Kao has no plans to market products under its own brand name through Jergens . He said Kao may introduce new products for facial care and hair treatment through Jergens , but it could be several years before Kao becomes visible in U.S. stores . He said Jergens will gradually shift its marketing emphasis to advertising from store promotions and dealer incentives . Analysts say there is a strong chance that Kao will take advantage of an earlier U.S. acquisition . Last year , it bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisclosed sum . High Point produces raw materials for toiletries and personal-care products . The analysts also think Kao is pursuing the correct strategy in the U.S. , particularly the decision to bide its time . " Kao is a very established , very old and somewhat prudent company . They would not jump into something blindfolded without thorough research , " Mr. Maynard says .
