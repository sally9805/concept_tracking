 | In a hushed conference room at Los Alamos National Laboratory , I watch an ancient calamity unreel . The only sound is the clickety-click of a 16-mm projector , turning thousands of computer-generated frames into a color movie . The movie could be called a day in the life of the solar system ? a day some 4.6 billion years ago , and now compressed into a few minutes of running time . At first I see Earth spinning in three-dimensional space . Actually it is a proto-Earth , an infant planet newly hatched from the swirling matter surrounding the Sun . It is still partly liquid , with an eggshell crust just forming . The computer has colorcoded it so that its iron core is purple , the granite mantle , red . Suddenly , another body , roughly the size of Mars , enters the frame . It too has a purple-coded iron core . Travel , Mg at 2,500 miles per hour , it strikes ' Earth a glancing but cataclysmic blow , shearing off part of Earth 's mantle and disintegrating in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat that great globs of matter vaporize and jet into space , flying around the now-deformed Earth in orbit . Soon , however , the iron core of the impactor , inexorably drawn by gravity , plows back into Earth , and settles to the center . And slowly coalescing in orbit about the new Earth is a clump of mantle material ? granite particles . That iron-poor mass is the newborn Moon . The celestial drama I have just seen is one version of what is now called the giant-impact theory of the Moon 's origin . Originally propounded in the mid-1970s , it was met with a reception ranging from indifference to derision . Today , the theory is being accepted by a growing number of the world 's astronomers as : the answer to the vexing puzzle of the Moon 's origin , a puzzle hundreds of years aid . As recently , as a few years ago , astronomers were bemoaning the seeming intractability of the problem . In 1983 , for example , University of Texas professor of astronomy Roman Smoluchowski wrote , in his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an embarrassing uncertainty about the Moon 's origin . " And writing in the preface of the recently published Origin of the Moon , one of that volume 's editors , astronomer William K. Hartmann of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson , Ariz. , summed up the general mood circa 1984 less gingerly : " . . . the Moon continues to tease us . Where did the blasted thing come from ? " Computing is the answer Why the switch from massive uncertainty about the origin of " the blasted thing " in a very brief time ? The answer is testimony not only to the power and elegance of the scien , tific process but also to the stunning contributions of supercomputing to that process . For it is likely that without the efforts of two teams of scientists working with such computers at two national laboratories , the giantimpact theory would still be just a fillip to the lore of lunar evolution . Instead , it seems to answer many of the objections that have plagued the three classical theories of the Moon 's origin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correct theory of the three ? but failed . Indeed , these theories have had a long and tumultuous history . Stephen G. Brush of the University of Maryland calls them the " wife , " " sister " and " daughter " theories . More 60 POPULAR SCIENCE  | formally , they are known respectively as the capture , co-accretion for double planet ) , and fission theories . Each one logically imposes certain constraints on the chemical and physical properties of the Moon , and on the Earth-Moon system . To the extent that they can be matched up with the known properties of Earth and its peculiar satellite , these theories are therefore testable . To see why they have ' all foundered , a little history is in order . The double-planet theory is probably the oldest , having suggested by Pierre-Simon Laplace , the French mathematician and astronomer who died in 1827 . It simply states that Earth and the Moon just happened to condense , or accrete ; put of the solar nebula in close proximity , so that one became the satellite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two bodies , apart from mass , ought to be virtually identical . That constraint is removed , however , if the Moon were formed somewhere else in the solar system ( where the region 's chemistry might be quite different ) and then sailed close to Earth , there to be captured and set ' in orbit by Earth 's gravitational field . That idea was championed in this ' century by Harold Urey . Most esteemed in the popular imagination of the time was the fission theory . Sir George Howard Darwin , second son of the more memorable Charles , was an astronomer who made a particular study of the tidal forces in the solar system . In 1878 , he proposed that while Earth was still liquid , forces set up by its own rotation , in conjunction with solar tides , created an unstable bulge at the equator , which eventually ripped off to become the Moon . The idea was seized upon in 1882 by the English physicist Osmond Fisher , who reasoned that the immense basin of the Pacific Ocean was actually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate tectonics and continental drift has shown that the Pacific basin formed much more recently than 4.6 billion years ago . The fission theory itself was apparently scotched in 1930 by mathematical analyses proving that the scenario Darwin proposed simply could not have happened . But some versions of formation by fission Dave been rein'vigorated more recently , and still have their proponents : So , indeed , did all three classical theories up to the time of the Apollo program , despite the fact that each . one had grave difficulties . In fact ; says A. G. W. Cameron , professor of astronomy at the Harvard Observatory and a dean of American lunar experts , , " that was one of the principal scientific objectives of Apollo ? to resolve the pickle we were in " ' Of course , astronomers knew something about the Moon before Apollo . Telescopic and early spacecraft observations , together with precise calculations based on Earth 's and the Moon 's orbits , provided data on the satellite 's size , mass , density , and so on . About its chemical composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon could not have very much iron in its core . The reason : The . average density of Earth is 5.5 grams ' per cubic centimeter ; that of the Moon is about 3.3 grams per cubic centimeter , close to the density of Earth 's mantle rocks without iron . Buried treasure Beginning with Apollo 11 in 1969 , and ending when Eugene Cernan clambered into his Apollo 17 lunar module in 1972 , the project provided a torrent of information about the Moon and its chemistry . A total of 12 astronauts walked on the Moon , scrabbled through its rock and soil for treasure ? and found it , retrieving some 850 pounds of rock , dust , and core samples snatched from beneath the surface . The samples , declared geophysicist Eugene Shoemaker , were " an unprecedented scientific bonanza . New techniques were applied and better analyses performed on them than had ever been applied to Earth rocks . " Many scientists were ecstatic : " The old Moon is dead , " chortle Gerald Wasserburg , who headed a Cal-@# @# @#  | ifornia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asylum " ) that had a principal role in the Moon rocks ' analysis . But which theory would the findings support ? Where was the Cinderella whose dainty foot the Apollo slipper would fit ? Data do n't jibe As the deluge of results continued , one conclusion became disappointingly clear : None of the three theories provided a perfect fit with the evidence ? or even a very close one . Some of the chemical fingerprints of the Moon rocks supported one theory or another , but contradicted the other two . For example , abundances of some of the major elements in Earth 's crust ? silicon , magnesium , iron , manganese ? were closely matched by the same elements analyzed in the Moon rocks . " They were similar enough , " says Henry J. Melosh , professor of planetary science at the University of Arizona , " that with a little chemical diddling you could say that on the basis of major elements the Moon and Earth are from the same parent body " But then important differences began to appear when researchers looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hard to vaporize , such as aluminum , calcium oxide , chromium oxide , and titanium . The Moon 's crust contains twice as much or more of these substances as Earth 's . So the investigators who looked at refractory elements , says Melosh , cried " Oh no , Earth and Moon are totally different . That rules out Darwin 's fission hypothesis . In fact , it rules out co-accretion , too . " Moon-rock analyzers found the most striking differences , however , in volatiles ? things that are easy to vaporize , such as sodium and potassium . The Moon has far less than Earth . And as for highly volatile water ? forget it . " Earth has a couple of percent water in its mantle rocks , " says Melosh . " The Moon has absolutely none . Not a single molecule of water has been found in any lunar rock . Oh , there was some excitement when one of the Apollo missions brought back what looked like a rusty rock . Now , rust is not just iron and oxygen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed that finally there was some evidence for water on the Moon , and there was a big flap . But it turned out that the water had just come from a leaky rock box . " The results therefore seemed totally contradictory . The evidence of the refractories and volatiles ruled out fission and co-accretion , but the major elements supported those theories and made capture unlikely . " The whole game was completely confused , " says Melosh . Cameron recalls that NASA provided a grant to study how the ideas of participants in the Apollo rock analysis would change as the project proceeded . " A psychologist from the University of Pittsburgh came around and interviewed everybody at the beginning of the program to see which one of the classical theories the scientists believed in . Then as the results came in , he kept checking with the same people to see how these beliefs were changing . What he found was that people 's ideas hardly changed at all . The scientists involved tended to stick to what they believed in the first place , and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have much of an impact . " The data supported all three theories to some degree , and conflicted with all of them ? so you could take your pick . And that 's when things petered out for a while , and interest in lunar origins tended to run along at a low level . " Then in the mid-1970s , another and very different theory of the Moon 's origin was advanced . Cameron and his colleague William Ward at Harvard were attacking another lunar puzzle : the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system . ( Angular momentum is a measure of the product of the mass and rotational velocity of a spinning or orbiting body ) Pre-Apollo , astrophysicists knew that this quantity was unusually high , compared with any of the other terrestrial planets . How did the EarthMoon system get so much spin ? " We came up with a very simple thought experiment , " says Cameron . " Suppose we had an initial Earth that was n't spinning very fast , like the other bodies in the early solar system . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . If we hit it in the most efficient way ? tangentially , along the equator ? how big would  | that impactor have to be ? The answer comes out to be an object about the size of Mars traveling about 11 kilometers per second . Once we had that picture , its consequences became worth investigating in their own right . " Cameron and Ward quickly realized that such a giant impact would vaporize a tremendous amount of material , and they evolved some complex routes by which this material could be put into orbit , eventually to form the Moon . ( Quite independently , and at about the same time , Hartmann and Donald Davis were also advancing an impact theory . But theirs relied on a steady and random bombardment of small planetesimals colliding with Earth and spewing out vapor ? a scenario that would not have solved the angular-momentum problem . ) The giant-impact theory was attractive from the start because it was capable of resolving all the conflicting evidence , both pre- and post-Apollo . First , a giant impact would have supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the impacting body were differentiated in much the same way that Earth was , with an iron core much denser than its mantle ( a belief thoroughly consistent with current ideas of the formation of the solar system ) , then the absence of a large iron core within the Moon could be explained , too . " Before Apollo , " says Cameron , " we knew from various measurements that the mean density of the Moon was abnormally low , so it had to be depleted in iron . But we did n't know just how small its iron core , if any , had to be . @#  | That required the seismic experiments and other measurements carried out on the Moon during the Apollo Project . " ( Earth 's iron core accounts for about 33 percent of its mass . The upper limit on the Moon 's iron core is about two percent . ) If the impact sheared primarily mantle material from both bodies and vaporized it , then that would account for an iron-poor Moon . Volatiles ? Most would be lost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , would condense out of the vapor early ; the portion lost from Earth 's crust would therefore wind up in the lunar material . If the giant-impact theory seemed to explain much , it attracted little attention at first . " I would n't say there was any real hostility , " says Harvard 's Cameron , " there was just a lack of any real interest . I remember presenting a paper on the idea at a conference in Houston . I showed a drawing of a round thing with a smaller round thing sitting on it to represent the scenario , and in the question period one of the astronomers got up and referred to my celestial Shmoo ' I the comical creature in the Li'l Abner ' comic strip . It got a big laugh . " Over the next eight years , however , the laughing died down , and more and more astronomers became seriously interested in studying the impact theory . In October 1984 , lunar scientists assembled in Kona , Hawaii , for a watershed conference on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting stimulated some people to begin real calculations on the impact theory , " says Cameron . " In fact , I had been intending to do some myself for several years , but the press of other things had interfered . There is nothing like an upcoming meeting to raise to the highest level the priority of something you 've been wanting to do , so I went ahead at Kona . " It was clear even before the meeting that a great deal of attention was being devoted to the impact theory . " Indeed , " writes Hartmann , one of the organizers of the conference , " we were surprised by this unexpected convergence I on the giant-impact model as we read the various abstracts that were prepared independently by various authors and submitted to us in mid-1984 . " " I can only assume , " says Cameron , " that the shift occurred because the classical theories remained intractable , and because more people saw @# @# merit in the impact theory for a variety of reasons . " Not that there was anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood of Harvard gave a talk on the various theories , he assigned them all academic grades , as if they had been turned in by students . " He gave the giant-impact theory an ' Incomplete , ' " Cameron remembers , " and that was fair because there was a lot of work left to investigate its validity . " Los Alamos and the Cray Enter the supercomputer . Cameron himself had done only simple analyses carried out on his own PC . But a month after Kona , in November 1984 , he went to Los Alamos National Laboratory to talk about the whole problem of the Moon 's origin and to discuss his presentation at Kona . That visit had important consequences for two Los Alamos researchers and for the impact theory . Wayne Slattery , a former postdoctoral student of Cameron 's , said he would enjoy working on the theory as a relief from the sort of humdrum work he was doing , because he was in the weapons division and could n't publish anything he was doing there . Also present at the talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived from Geneva University , where he had developed a computer code for the simulation of hydrodynamics ? fluid motions ? in three dimensions . It was much more effective than conventional techniques . He was running the code on one of Los Alamos 's several Cray supercomputers to investigate stellar collisions , his chief interest . " When Cameron came here , " Benz told me at Los Alamos , " I did n't have so much as an idea about the origin of the Moon ... I really did n't care about it . But then Cameron presented some simulations of collisions using his own code , and I thought , well I 'm smashing stars together in the astrophysics group , and I 'm already doing collisions with my own more sophisticated code , so I thought it might be a good idea to work on the Moon problem as well . " What this happy coincidence allowed Cameron to do was to get Slattery and Benz to work together on the impact theory . " And that was essential for any real progress to be made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supercomputer time were being made available to the theoretical-astrophysics people at Los Alamos . The attitude of the people in Slattery 's weapons division , however , was that the kind of time we wanted  | was trivial . But when I talked to people on the outside about the amount of supercomputer time we were able to get , the typical reaction was Wow ! ' It was very large by the standard of university access of supercomputers . " Benz 's hydrodynamic code ? or computer program ? became seven or eight thousand lines long after being modified for the impact-theory simulations . " That 's very short compared with the kind they are used to at Los Alamos in weapons research ; 100,000 lines would be a short one .... " The team began simulating collisions of proto-Earth , changing numbers of variables : the mass ratio of the two objects ; their composition ( for example , solid or molten ) ; their relative speeds . " You have to realize , " says Benz , " that one simulation is sort of expensive . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we could n't do hundreds of different combinations of things ; we had to stay within certain bounds . " Computer film The result of the collaboration was the movie described at the beginning of this article . The film I saw actually contained four different simulations , each varying the mass ratio of the impactor to proto-Earth . Only one , in which the mass of the sledgehammer body was one-seventh that of the proto-Earth , or a little larger than the mass of Mars , gave rise to an almost immediate formation of the Moon ; but the others all produced material in orbit that would eventually coalesce into the Moon . ( Incidentally , when I asked Benz how the computer data were transformed into photographic film , he said that because the computer itself was in a secret area to which he did not have access , he had no idea . " What happens , " he says , " is that I get these enormous files from the computer , I send them somewhere , and the next morning I have a roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice thing about these results , " says Benz , " is that it gives the impact theory great credibility ; one of astronomy 's greatest puzzles may have been solved . The theory takes care of all previous questions about the Moon 's formation . And our work would have been simply impossible without the supercomputers at the lab . The calculations would just have been too complex otherwise . " Meanwhile , back at another supercomputer .. . Melosh , like Benz , had had no riveting interest in the Moon 's origin at the time of the Kona conference . " I 'd been working with impact cratering for some time , " he told me one scorching day last July , in the relative cool of his office at the University of Arizona in Tucson . " I 've studied the impact of the ten-kilometer asteroid , or whatever , that supposedly wiped out the dinosaurs sixty-five million years ago " Killer Asteroid , " PS , Feb. ' 83 and , more recently , on the ejection of meteorites from planets . I 'd heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous commitments . But a colleague here did go , and when he got back we started talking about this giant-impact theory , which had been a hot topic at Kona . " Well , I found the whole idea very unappealing , and in fact decided that some of the people there did n't know about celestial mechanics , about how material could be put in orbit after a big impact , and were blabbering away in ignorance of facts . It just did n't make sense to me from an impact point of view , at least not for solid debris . So I decided to see if I could n't rule out the idea altogether . " But in a very short time I realized I was wrong ? that it is n't solids that make any contribution ... but that if a large body strikes Earth obliquely at high speed , you get a jet of molten or vaporized material that shoots out on the order of ten to fifteen kilometers per second . The idea of gas ejection had been suggested by Al Cameron in 1975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth , but I did n't know about it . Anyway , the impact theory began to look very good to me because it explained the chemistry problems rather nicely and also could explain the orbital dynamics of how this stuff gets into orbit around Earth . It required no special pleading , unlike other theories . It seemed very natural and straightforward . " I presented my calculations at a lunar and planetary science conference in Houston , in March 1985 . There had been so much interest raised at Kona that there were enough papers to put together a special session on the origin of the Moon . I submitted an abstract to that session , along with about seven other people . Mine was strongly in favor of the giant-impact theory . I mean , there 's no one quite so enthusiastic about an idea as a recent convert . I knew that Bill Hartmann was going to give a talk in support of the impact theory , and that the other five papers about which I 'd heard were going to prove that it was all wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real good fight , which , " Melosh announced with a shake of his @#  | formidable beard , " I am not exactly known to avoid ... So the session started and the first speaker was S. R. Taylor of the Australian National University , who had gone through in his pre-program abstract all the reasons why the impact theory could n't possibly be true . But he got up and said , Well , I 've gone through the other abstracts submitted to the conference on the impact origin of the Moon and thought about it , and I have to withdraw my abstract . In fact , I think it is a wonderful idea . ' And then two other speakers , whose abstracts showed they were going to be highly critical of the impact theory , got up and explained why it worked really well . " So instead of a fight , the whole session was a consensus . Kevin Burke , the director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute , told me afterwards , You know , I 'm just bewildered ... I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon in my entire career . ' I think it 's fair to say that giant impact is the consensus theory for the origin of the Moon right now . Everything fits . " Similar simulations Melosh had been consulting at Sandia National Laboratories , working on problems of rock fragmentation with the help of one of Sandia 's computer experts , Marlin Kipp . One day after the Houston meeting , Melosh started talking about all the excitement over the impact theory and Kipp became fascinated . " Why do n't you just do the necessary numerical calculations ? " Kipp asked , and Melosh responded that he just did n't have the supercomputer resources available . Whereupon Kipp sat down at the terminal connected to one of Sandia 's Crays and began to type , using one of the lab 's well-validated hydrodynamic codes . " That 's how I got into the business of computer simulations of Mars-sized objects smashing into Earth ? accidentally , " said Melosh . The results : not a movie like the Los Alamos simulation , but a series of color-coded slides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different codes , and vary in many technical matters , they are in fundamental agreement about one thing : the credibility of the giantimpact theory . Both groups say there are no basic conflicts between the two simulations . In fact , Melosh and Benz ( who has now joined Cameron at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ) are trading important technical nuggets missing from each other 's codes , in the hope of deriving more realistic simulations . Sandia , however , will no longer be a participant in such supercomputer work . " Star Wars " ( Strategic Defense Initiative ) has preempted things there , and Melosh is looking elsewhere for access to a Cray or its equivalent . Solving other mysteries What next ? The solar system holds other mysteries besides the Moon 's origin , and the giant-impact theory may contribute to their solution . " Mercury evidently has a huge surplus of iron in its core , " says Cameron . " Perhaps late in its formation it suffered a collision with another planetsized body and most of the mantle was driven off . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really spectacular . " And then there 's Uranus , with its bizarrely tilted axis of rotation , unlike any other planet 's . There have been previous suggestions that only some massive collision could have knocked Uranus on its side . Finally , there is the Pluto/Charon system , at the farthest reaches of the solar system . The ratio of the mass of this satellite to Pluto 's is even higher than that of the Moon to Earth 's . " In two or three years , " says Cameron , " we may be analyzing that system in terms of an impact . " Despite the wave of excitement over the giant-impact theory , there are astronomers who resist it , either because they favor another theory of the Moon 's origin or because they find the impact theory flawed , improbable , or at least inadequately proved . John Wasson , a UCLA astronomer , is one of the unconverted . " One thing that bothers me about the theory , " he says , " is that you must have available for the collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar system , and I do n't believe there are any good models that would produce such a body so late . Also , the probability of the impactor striking Earth a glancing blow is just a few percent . Combine these two improbabilities , and you get a very unlikely event . Of course , sometimes very unlikely events happen nevertheless , and that is what the giant-impact people are saying . " Wasson 's own belief is that it is far more likely that the Moon formed in Earth orbit from the debris of planetesimal collisions , a version of the accretion theory and a scenario that he believes could accommodate all the known chemical and physical data . " It 's healthy to have other people accept things reluctantly in science , " says Cameron . " If I have a fault , it 's probably that I accept new things too easily . " But he said it with a smile .
