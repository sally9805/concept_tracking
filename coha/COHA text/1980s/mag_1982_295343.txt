Trampling on Old Glory <P> The anti-American demonstration had been meticulously orchestrated . On the third anniversary of the downfall of Shah Mohammed Reza Palahvi , about 30,000 Iranians converged on Tehran 's Azadi ( Freedom ) Square shouting imprecations against the U.S. At the same time , units of Islamic Guards and militia marched upon outsized American flags that had been laid along their route . Then , as the televised parade approached the dignitaries who had assembled in the square , a Soviet flag was mysteriously thrown down in front of the marchers . Before the troops could be halted and a startled official could retrieve it , the red banner was trampled upon as well . Hojjatoleslam Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani , the speaker of the Iranian parliament , later apologized for the desecration of the Soviet emblem , saying it had all been " a plot to sabotage the revolution 's diplomacy .

Though the rightists have thus far lost the battle to keep the Islamic revolution uncontaminated by Communist support , they have gathered strength in the power struggle over who will succeed Khomeini . Government leaders have announced that preparations are being made for the selection of a supreme council of experts , which will consist of three to five theologians who will take over when Khomeini dies or he becomes too sick to rule . The council might well include one or more right-wing mullahs . <P> The immediate effect of the announcement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stories were further fueled by word that the ailing 81-year-old leader had canceled all his appointments for two weeks . Explained one highly placed Iranian : " There 's nothing wrong with him . He just needs a respite from the power struggle , which is driving him crazy . "
