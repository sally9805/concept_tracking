 | Rock and roll gets old fast . Established groups rarely break new ground , and ever since rock swelled into a billion-dollar business , record companies and radio stations have been notably reluctant to invest in truly innovative bands . Then , last year , an unknown band called the Stray Cats sold 2 million copies of their Americandebut album largely on the strength of a couple of three-and-a-half-minute videotapes , and suddenly the rules changed . Rock video is standing music on its ear : helping to revive the troubled record industry , shaking up radio play lists and intensifying a racial controversy that has been simmering for a long time . Playing almost nothing but single-song rock tapes 24 hours a day , the cable-television channel MTV has become the most effective way for a new group to get national exposure . " Its impact is phenomenal , " says Bob Krasnow , chairman of Elektra/ Asylum records . One of his acts , Greg Kihn , went hitless for eight years until MTV 's heavy airplay of " Jeopardy " helped him reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record companies are hiring video departments and funding them with budgets that run into the millions . Any new group that wants a recording contract today must demonstrate video potential in addition to musical talent ; this does not mean that every new album will be accompanied by a video , but forward-looking executives are including money for at least one video in almost every contract they sign this year . And a variety of new video-music channels are coming on-line , raising the possibility that television 's musical diversity may soon rival radio 's . Variations : But video music is not just radio with pictures . It is giving rock a way to be new again : the simple fact that the tapes come in so many different styles can be enough to keep you watching . You can see anything from an elaborate production number like Billy Joel 's blue-collar ballet " Allentown " to an unadorned concert clip . There are thoughtful pieces ? Joe Jackson 's meditation on masculinity , " Real Men " and comedies ? Randy Newman 's sardonic " I Love L.A. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Come Dancing . " Of course some acts are more suited to video than others . Michael Jackson 's feline prancing makes him the most videogenic performer of all while most heavy-metal concert tapes are surprisingly lifeless , the video only underscoring the lack of spontaneity in the performers ' choreographed abandon . Perhaps naively , some tapes try to be daring or stylishly decadent only to end up sexist and tasteless . Several clips feature women in leather gear acting out scenes of torture , bondage and violence , and Billy Idol 's " White Wedding " includes Nazistyle salutes . MTV seems to follow network television 's hypocritical policy of severely restricting nudity while giving violence a comparatively free hand ; a Nazi-style salute from Idol 's tape appears in one of MTV 's own on-air promotions . To record-company executives , that sin-  | gularly clear-thinking breed , the question is not " Is it art ? " but " Does it move product ? " By all accounts , the answer is yes . Duran Duran 's album " Rio " spent the better part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts . Then the band 's risque tape , " Girls on Film , " playing in rock clubs , generated enough word of mouth to help persuade MTV programmers to place another song from the album on the heavy air-play list . Four months later , " Rio " hit the top 10 on Billboard 's album chart ; this week it will sell its millionth copy . In Dallas , where about half the city is wired for cable television , market research showed that " Rio " sold extremely well in record stores in the wired sections , sluggishly in the rest of town . " Video is doing what tours used to do , " says Bob Hart of EMI records , " putting the artist in front of the audience . " And with MTV , a group can tour the whole country at once : the music channel is wired into 1,500 cities and towns . Television touring is not restricted to living rooms ? at rock clubs across the country live entertainers are sharing the bill with tapes played on huge video screens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to sit down and watch TV or even just blank out , " according to Claire Wilson , video jockey at New York 's Danceteria , which provides a separate video lounge for rockers . Box Office : Nevertheless , no one expects video to make touring obsolete . " The audience needs to be part of an event , " says Krasnow . And there 's something in it for the band : " Those artists who are popular can make substantial money on the road , " says veteran tour promoter Bill Graham . In addition to the box-office take , performers profit from sales of T shirts , caps , buttons and posters in and around the arena . When it comes to mixing sight and sound , MTV has undeniably been the most potent catalyst . The tape library at the Manhattan-based channel numbers 1,000 titles ? small in comparison to a radio-station inventory , but with one crucial differnce : " We play 80 percent new music , 20 percent old , " boasts MTV chief Bob Pittman . " Radio is just the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since little-known avant-garde bands often make the best videos , MTV gives them the kind of air play that most radio stations reserve for supergroup cuts from the ' 60s and ' 70s . MTV 's livelier mix may account for the fact that some people use it like a radio , just listening while they do things around the house . The hipness of all this is diminished only by the utterly synthetic video jockeys , who look like graduates of a Clearasil commercial . MTV 's emphasis on the new has not gone unnoticed at radio stations . Richard Neer , rogram director ( and morning D.J. ) of New York 's venerable WNEW-FM , says , " We may get a record in that we 're not sure about , see it on MTV over the weekend , get it  | into our heads and decide to play it . " Similarly , radio-programming consultant Lee Abrams , noting the slump in album-oriented rock-station ratings since the advent of MTV , has altered his recipe for success by adding a heavy dose of new music . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new medium its first controversy . Pittman pleads that few black acts record the kind of rock and roll he wants MTV to play . After all , he says , MTV plays no country and Western , or disco , either . MTV 's defenders point out that many FM radio stations are equally restrictive . Not everyone takes so complacent a stance . " They probably started out with a requirement of no niggers , " says Rick James . " They 're catering to a white audience . " James 's album " Street Songs " has sold almost 4 million copies , but videos of the album 's smash singles " Super Freak " and " Give It to Me Baby " have yet to appear on MTV . " The tragedy is that here 's an opportunity to break down the barriers and they do n't do it , " says Chris Blackwell , founder of Island Records , who introduced Bob Marley to American audiences . Fortunately for James and other black acts , video music is not the private domain of MTV . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a twiceweekly , eight-hour show that plays longer , more-adventurous clips , including the work of black and Latin musicians . Other outfits are aiming directly at the audiences slighted by MTV . Black Entertainment Television , a cable service with 3.5 million viewers , devotes one and a half hours a week to current black videos and will expand that to six hours in September . Apollo Entertainment Television plans to launch a nationwide cable channel in early 1984 to play an " urban contemporary " format ? including reggae , rhythm and blues , salsa and jazz . Directed at a different musical minority , The Nashville Network began twanging the cable last month , offering 18 hours of country entertainment daily . Juke joints : For 50 cents a play , you can do your own programming on the video jukeboxes now installed in 26 select juke joints . For considerably more money , you can buy the tapes . The albums cost between $30 and $80 ; so far , only Olivia Newton-John 's " Physical " and Blondie 's " Eat to the Beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just released three video singles , including Duran Duran 's " Girls on Film , " priced $15.95 in the Beta format or $19.95 in VHS . Sony hopes its lower price ? and shorter length ? will make it more popular than full-length video albums . Like the tapes it plays , MTV has so far failed to earn a profit for its owners , cable giants Warner Communications and American Express . Reaching 12 million cable-television homes , MTV claims to deliver an audience that is an advertiser 's wish list : 85 percent of its viewers are between 12 and 34 years old . The problem , says Pittman , is " getting advertisers to change their habits and strategies , to get more of them to come over to cable . " For now , MTV charges only $1,000 to $1,500 for a 30-second spot near the bottom of the chart for a national broadcaster . There may be just a shade of irony in that , because rock videos themselves were created as a form of advertising . They first appeared about five years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock bands to seek other kinds of exposure . The " promo clips " were distributed to discos and television shows like England 's " Top of the Pops , " or shown at recordindustry gatherings . That head start accounts for the fact that England still dominates the field ; many of the most successful directors , including Russell Mulcahy ( " Rio " ) , trained on promo clips , and synthpop groups like After the Fall ( " Der Kommissar " ) make some of the best tapes . " In the early days , our productions were cheap and cheerful , " says producer John Weaver of London-based Keefco . " We 'd go into a seven-light studio , shoot the band in one afternoon and edit as we went along . The client would walk out with a tape that day . " Today 's tapes may still be cheerful , but cheap they are not . The cost of an average video hovers between $35,000 and $45,000 but several performers have splurged spectacularly . " Allentown " broke the $100,000 barrier , and David Bowie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# @# NEWSWEEK/APRIL 18 , 1-Dance " on location in the Australian outback . There are beginning to be hints of Hollywood in the way videos are financed , too . Record companies sometimes arrange joint-venture agreements with the artists . And a few megagroups use some of their megabucks to pay for their own productions . The Rolling Stones , for example , underwrote the videos from their album " Tattoo You " to buy the filmmaker 's Holy Grail ? complete creative control . Pros : Along with fatter budgets have come the video professionals . To direct " Beat It , " Michael Jackson chose rock-video virgin Bob Giraldi , best known for his enormously successful Miller Lite beer commercials . Filmmaker Martin Scorsese is said to be at work on a video project with Robbie Robertson , formerly of The Band . Too much professionalism could destroy the unpredictable , do-it-yourself style that enlivens the tapes . " Some of these bands think they 're doing a remake of Citizen Kane ' , " complains Stanard Ridgway of Wall of Voodoo . " When you use less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than create slick effects that people see on TV anyway . " Ridgway wrote and directed " Mexican Radio " for his band on less than $15,000 . Along with altering the way we experience music , video is influencing the way music is made . " Video changed the way I approach making an album , the way I write songs , " says Kim Carnes , whose hit single " Bette Davis Eyes " won a Grammy in 1981 . " As we 're recording we 're thinking in terms of what 's going on visually . " While no one is shutting his eyes to video . some still view it with suspicion . Bruce Springsteen chose to make a video of " Atlantic City " without appearing in it . Joe Jackson , despite his success with video . supports Springsteen . " People should n't have to make videos , " Jackson says . " If they just want to be musicians , that should be enough . It seems that music itself is becoming less and less important . " Daryl Hall , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music should still be listened to . " Well , no one 's going to argue with that . One of the signal virtues of music is its power to evoke deep , wordless sensations ? effects that vary from one hearing to the next . Video decides what your fantasy will be and fixes it on the screen every time the song is played . But a good video can act like a hook , giving a tune just enough extra energy to make it memorable . Even the worst videos have some pep , and most manage to be exuberant , witty or weird . Whether video will expand rock and roll or just box it in is up to the performers . And at the very least , rock video is finally giving the television generation a chance to make its own mark on the tube .
