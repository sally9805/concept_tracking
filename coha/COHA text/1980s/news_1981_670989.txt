Even today , at 37 , three seasons removed from professional football and with his status as sports superhero now a memory , it is an identity he works hard to maintain , at the same time conceding that " I had confidence playing football , but now I listen , I learn , maybe I train harder than I did once . I ' m a real infant at this. " // " This , " is the former quarterback ' s leap into the starring role in " Damn Yankees , " which opens the Jones Beach Theater ' s 30th season Tuesday , and he is banking on his portrayal of Joe Hardy , the aging baseball player who sells his soul to the Devil in return for leading the Washington Senators to the pennant , to open the doors to a show business career that he has sporadically flirted with. // Previous roles : Beaver Falls , Pennsylvania high school hero ; star football player for Bear Bryant ' s University of Alabama ; glamorously arrogant playboy-quarterback of the New York Jets who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; star of several highly forgettable movies and of his own short-lived television series ; occasional player on the legitimate stage , and television shill for , among other things , pantyhose and men ' s cologne . And Joe Namath has managed to seem boyish and unchangeable as he swung through each. // " I guess they were all easier , " he says . " I went from one area of competence in sports to another , areas where I was always told , or where I felt , I was the best. // " But this , " he said with a grin and a wave that took in the " Damn Yankees " rehearsal hall , " this has been tough at times , frustrating , but it ' s been a good education. " // Mr. Namath gets good grades from two of his current teachers , his " Damn Yankees , " director , Frank Wagner , and his co-star , Susan Elizabeth Scott , a veteran of " On the Twentieth Century , " who is playing Lola ( the Devil ' s sexy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie Bracken will play Charlie Applegate , otherwise known as the Devil. // Mr. Wagner says that his star is " really utterly charming and , surprisingly , terribly disciplined and willing to work . " Miss Scott , admitting that when she was told she was co-starring with Mr. Namath , she thought , " It might be fun , although I didn ' t know too much about football , " has found that " Joe is very serious about making this his career. " // But there is time for fun and games , too. // At a recent rehearsal , Mr. Wagner called out for Mr. Namath and Miss Scott to run through the scene preceding what is perhaps the show ' s best-known song , the seductive " Whatever Lola Wants. " // Mr. Namath , in jeans and yachting shirt , Miss Scott in black leotards , bright green overpants and shiny black pirate boots sauntered to center stage , sat on a bench and began talking : Joe Hardy mentioning that he has heard that Lola has rented a room ; Lola answering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe saying , " You ' re making things difficult , " and Lola singing , " Whatever Lola wants , Lola gets . . . " Whereupon Mr. Namath embraced Miss Scott , forced her into the crook of his arm and kissed her for a rather long time. // " Hey Joe , I notice you do some scenes better than others , " yelled Wayne Little , Mr. Namath ' s road manager , who was sitting near a piano behind Mr. Wagner. // Mr. Namath laughed , Miss Scott laughed and Mr. Wagner laughed . They settled back into dialogue . Joe Hardy asked where Mr. Applegate was and Lola said she had given him a pill to put him to sleep . Joe asked , " Why didn ' t you give him two ? " Then he and Lola went into the Lost Souls Cafe where Lola ordered " two demon rums , " and they sang , in duet , " Two Lost Souls . " Miss Scott , who has a lilting voice , carried the song , but Mr. Namath ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t embarrass anybody " ) sang along in a baritone. // Mr. Wagner and a group of assistants and stagehands applauded . Mr. Namath grinned . Miss Scott bowed , by herself , then said loudly to Mr. Namath , " Take a bow , will you , they ' re applauding , " then walked in back of him and kicked him , gently , in his backside . They both laughed again. // Later , Mr. Wagner and Mr. Namath went to lunch in a coffee shop near Rockefeller Plaza and as they walked in , Mr. Namath was overwhelmed by those who still remember him . Several young women yelled , " Kiss me , Joe , " and , said Mr. Wagner , " People came in with pictures of him , Lord knows where they came from , asking him to sign them . He did . He seemed at his most vulnerable then. " // Mr. Wagner staged " The Sound of Music " at Jones Beach in 1979 and " Music Man " there last year . He has done the last few big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including " Rockette Spectacular , " " Manhattan Showboat , " the " Christmas Spectacular , " and Snow White . " He also directed " New Faces of 1968 , " and was with Julius Monk ' s " Upstairs at the Downstairs " for 10 years . Mr. Wagner said that Mr. Namath ' s " utter seriousness " had made his job easier. // Mr. Namath ' s sincerity about his new role is manifested in other ways as well . Since January of 1980 , he said , he has been studying voice with Arthur Joseph in Los Angeles . " Before that I was too embarrassed to sing , " he said , " even the national anthem standing next to my teammates on the field. " // Then , in 1979 , he made his stage debut ( after his movies , " C.C. &; Company , " " The Last Rebel " and " Norwood " ) with the Kenley Players in Ohio , playing Hal Carter in a production of " Picnic . " " I remember I was watching Tom and Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers acting , and I said to myself that I could be taught to sing . I decided I would do it . So I went to Mr. Joseph , and with his patience and understanding , I ' m singing , and I ' m learning to read music too . Do I play an instrument ? I have a piano at home in L.A. , and two mouth harps . I ' m trying to play , but not yet . When I ' m home , I work five days a week on singing . When I ' m on the road , I try to get at least three days in. " // During a forced break in rehearsals , when Mr. Namath had to fly to Los Angeles to tape a television special with Bonnie Franklin , he and Miss Scott rehearsed nightly by telephone , and in an imaginative way devised by Miss Scott . " What I would do is call , or Joe would call , and we talked as if we were the characters , he as Joe Hardy , I as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script . We did improvisational things . I might have said , for example , that my name was Lola and Mr. Applegate suggested I give him a call to get acquainted , maybe to get together with him . And he would answer in kind . We brought reality to the characters and it really helped us. " // Miss Scott , who was with American Place Theater , and who turned down several understudy roles because " I was understudying too much , and though it was satisfying to a point , I decided that I wanted to use my craft . This is the show to do it with , and because Joe Namath was going to be in it I felt that I wanted to do it . Motive ? Sure. " // Mr. Namath had appeared as " Li ' l Abner " in road productions of that show during the last two years , when Richard Horner , executive producer of the last two Jones Beach Theater productions called " Li ' l Abner " director Edward Greenberg and asked that Mr. Namath contact him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I didn ' t know how I could do it , " Mr. Namath said . Rehearsals , even the show , might be interrupted by Mr. Namath ' s annual football camp , which opened last week in Hamden , Conn. , and by his television and commercial commitments . " But they agreed to rehearse around them , and so I did it , " he said. // Mr. Namath has had a busy television guest-star career , appearing on virtually every talk and variety show as well as in most of the highly rated series . From 1969 to 1972 he had his own syndicated " The Joe Namath Show , " and managed associations with Faberge ' s Brut line of men ' s cosmetics , Joe Namath Clothes by Calvin , Dynamic Classics , Franklin Sporting Goods and Hanes Beauty Mist pantyhose . His varied television activities take him back and forth between his two homes , in Fort Lauderdale and in Los Angeles . He regards Florida as his home , but says " I took a place in Beverly Hills because I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he finished his football career with the Los Angeles Rams , he still regards himself as a member of the New York Jets , the team he led , as a brash-mouthed quarterback , to a 16-7 Super Bowl championship over the Baltimore Colts in 1969 . He remains preoccupied with football and counts among his closest friends , football players such as Joe Walton , Billy Mathis , Jerome Barkum , Art Fleming and Richard Todd . Of his old team , the Jets , who have become mired in the second division since his departure , Mr. Namath grinned and said , " If you do not have something good to say , don ' t say anything. " // Does he miss football ? " Sure , but if I thought I could play I ' d be there . But I can ' t . " He touched his knees , badly damaged several times in his career . " I ' m healthier now , happier too , I guess . I find the theater an entertaining world with opportunity for a lot of growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re so bright . You keep listening and you can ' t help but learn . For that aspect of it , I think the theater is better than movies or TV. " // Mr. Namath is looking forward to working and perhaps living on Long Island for the summer . " The team used to work out there , but I never stayed there , " he said . " I never went to the Jones Beach Theater either , though in retrospect it might have been a good idea to go to Coach Ewbank and ask to be allowed to miss curfew because I wanted to go to the theater . " Mr. Namath grinned. // Would the coach have allowed that ? " Maybe . You know , a lot of people talk about my missing curfews and sometimes I did , but there were always extenuating circumstances. " // Such as ? " Things . " Now that he has formed a show business career for himself , Mr. Namath was asked , has he thought of settling down , perhaps marrying ? " I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m looking , " he said . He was called back into rehearsal by Mr. Wagner , who took him and Miss Scott through " Whatever Lola Wants " and " Two Lost Souls , " again then called an end to rehearsals for the day . He told Mr. Namath to rest because rehearsals the following day would be at ll A.M. instead of the usual 10 o ' clock . He grinned widely as Mr. Little clapped his hands and said loudly , " Hear that ? Eleven . That gives us a little more room , Joe , another hour to play with . Thank you Mr. Wagner.
