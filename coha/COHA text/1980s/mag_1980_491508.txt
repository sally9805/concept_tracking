I 'm not Mary Poppins anymore  --  not that I ever was , " says Julie Andrews , whose name is back on the marquees in a movie with the mysterious title of 10 . The producer is her husband Blake Edwards , best known for his Pink Panther series . Edwards also happens to be director and screenplay writer , and Julie naturally seems very much at home . " My last three films were for Blake , " she says with that famous , concisely cheerful accent . " It 's more like playing a game together than doing a picture  --  almost . " Miss Andrews seems eager to avoid talking about her comeback and the fact that this is her first movie in years . ( Her last , Tamarind Seed with Omar Sharif , cleaned up overseas but did poorly in the States . ) Following on 10 's heels will be another film , Little Miss Marker , a Damon Runyon tale about a race-horse bookie ( played by Walter Matthau ) who is saddled with a sixyear-old girl he accepts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Filming two movies back-to-back after a nine-year dry spell marks a significant change in Julie Andrews ' career . Not so long ago , she was the biggest star in the world . Then her fairy-tale world caved in on her  --  she was labeled box office poison after doing the disastrous Star ! and Darling Lili , and her 10-year marriage to English designer Tony Walton ended unsympathetically . Her career went nowhere but down , and she tried again in television after her one-season series for Lord Lew Grade was cancelled by ABC . " That hurt for a long time , " she explains . " I found out we 'd been cancelled at the same time the general public did . There was no personal message , no politeness about it . " The superstar fled Hollywood for Switzerland , but continued to do TV specials out of London . She also wrote two highly successful children 's books under the name of Julie Edwards . Plus she completed more than five years of psychoanalysis . Never a staunch supporter of women 's lib , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children . She says without artificial sweetness , " I 'm more contented and at peace with myself now than I was as a box-office queen . I 'm less uptight . I 've even reached a stage where it does n't shatter me if somebody prints something bad about me . " Miss Andrews , who maintains the reserve typical of the British , has been known to greet interviewers by telling them she did n't care what they said about her . The more one gets to know her , the more one realizes the acting talents that transformed Julie into Eliza Doolittle on the stage ( Audrey Hepburn , of course , got the screen role , despite loud protest from Andrews fans ) and into Mary Poppins , Maria von Trapp and others on celluloid . For she is not , just as she insists , anything like the prim , saccharine Miss Poppins . The former child prodigy has made her share of enemies  --  usually unintentionally  --  and , contrary to her public image , does have a temper . " Women are typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other so-called manly qualities is wrong . Girls are made to feel guilty if they raise their voices or frown . I 've gotten over that hurdle , thank God , and now I 'm free to be myself . In Hollywood , even though I was a hot property , as they called it , I was often treated like a little girl , and I often did n't dare to protest . . . . Anyway , it all seems like worlds ago , so far away . " Julie 's life has been considerably enhanced by the addition of two little Vietnamese girls to the Edwards household : Amy Leigh and Joanna Lynn . " I 've always loved children and I wanted another , but by adoption . I 've spent most of my time in the past few years being with the children , caring for and looking after them , being the best mother I know how . " By Tony Walton , whose latest assignment was designing the fantastic costumes and sketches for The Wiz , she also has a teenage daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something less than the easiest time of it . Like any child , she 'd want her mother to have a very regular schedule , to be there whenever she needed or wanted her . Believe me , I wanted to be there . But fame can be such a trap , and it seems like the more successful you become  --  professionally  --  the more you have to work to maintain your success . It 's a vicious circle . And Emma had to contend with that huge figure up on the silver screen , as did I. " Miss Andrews is now closer to her eldest daughter than before , and she has made professional sacrifices to be with all her children . Yet she states clearly , " I do n't consider it a sacrifice or a particularly noble act , because I 'd rather be with my family than in a cold studio . " From time to time , she still does a Christmas or Easter TV special for her and Blake Edwards ' Jewel Production Company . But otherwise , until recently , her career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traveling , but it 's not on my own , it 's as Mrs. Blake Edwards . As a top producer and businessman , Blake is involved in several projects , and there 's never a dearth of interesting conversation , things to learn or activities to keep one vitally interested in life and entertainment . " At press conferences from Hawaii to Paris , promoting films like Revenge of the Pink Panther , Julie has been in the thick of things but deliberately stayed on the sidelines . Reporters at such affairs still tend to ask her the lion 's share of the questions , but she quietly demurs to her husband or to Peter Sellers or someone else . " I was glad to make 10 , " she explains matter-of-factly , " but it was not a comeback , because I never retired . I do n't plan my future far in advance , like , say , a producer would have to . I take life one day at a time and try to enjoy it to the fullest . " Her co-star in the romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily in Foul Play . The leading man was to have been George Segal , who bowed out almost the day before shooting began in Hollywood and Mexico  --  an episode Miss Andrews declines to talk about , for the benefit of all concerned . Like everybody else on the set , Moore had nothing but praise and affection for the star . " She 's a lady , " he intones , " and she 's very down-to-earth , honest and a regular person . I do n't believe she 's ever thought of herself as a huge celebrity , although God knows she is one . She has a huge following , even now , but I think she has a need to be liked . We all do , but she 's honest about it . " For his part , hubby Edwards states , " Julie 's never happier than when she 's pouring tea at a hen party . She 's a typical , middle-class Englishwoman . And a damned good wife , too ! " Both Edwardses prefer to work together or at least camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility of rearing children very seriously , she rules out going from one film to the next . " After Little Miss Marker , I do n't know when my next one will be , " she says , weary from the workouts , action and dialogue required of her . " It all depends on whether Blake is involved in the project or approves it , and whether it suits my schedule with the children . " Which job gives her more satis-faction ? She grimaces as though the answer were obvious . With mother-like patience , she notes , " I certainly would n't compare the rewards of watching one 's children grow and mature with that of money piling up at the box office . Both are pleasant , but to varying degrees . As the old saying goes , you ca n't take an audience home with you . You ca n't depend on the loyalty of fans , who , after all is said and done , are just faceless people one seldom sees . And few stars have their fans forever . But a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't depend on your looks , age or popularity at the moment . " Looking back , Miss Andrews is satisfied with her career , as well she should be . Although she has made only 10 motion pictures ( including 10 ) , such films as Mary Poppins , The Sound of Music , Hawaii and Thoroughly Modern Millie were among the most popular movies ever made . Julie was one of the first stars to receive a minimum of $1 million for every project , plus percentage points . Does she miss in any way the days of being No. 1 at the box office and everybody 's darling ? " No , not in any significant way , " she answers . " In a position like that , you have to realize that half your friends are your friends only because of who you are . When that year or two fades away , you discover who really loves you as a person , and then you can settle down to being good , true friends . That is really more peaceful for the soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards was n't the one who made the decision for Miss Andrews to curtail her cinematic and television activities , she points out . " I 'm all for women 's rights , but nowadays it seems that if you are n't vocal or radical about it , you get put down or criticized for your private lifestyle . " Friends say one reason the former box-office champ is now so enmeshed with her home routine is that she had no normal childhood . Since a tender age , she was performing in English music halls , billed as a child prodigy . Her mother had remarried , and having two fathers did n't make things less confusing . Looking back , she reports , " It was good training for me and I suppose it paved the way for what was to come . I would n't change much if I could go back and do it all over . But 1 would n't raise my own children that way . Being in show business is unnatural for a child , and I 'm not sure being an actor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in the world . For one thing , why are there so many performers going to psychiatrists ? That should tell you something of the pressures and problems . " With Edwards at her side most of the time ( he often monitors her interviews , and is obviously protective , in a kind way ) , Julie Andrews is very happy and secure doing an occasional film . Despite her occasional aloofness and her preference for a small , close circle of friends , Julie makes friends easily , and is warm and encouraging to most individuals she meets . Having scaled the heights , she is wary of those who seek to be friends of a Personality or who would like to exploit her or Blake , but she is unusually free of suspicion and bitterness . " I 'm not bitter about a thing , " she smiles , hands outstretched . " Why should I be ? And if I were , what would it gain me ? " When fans come up and request an autograph , she indulges them enthusiastically , then chats a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compliments about her splendid figure and ever-youthful looks genuinely please . " I was n't given much credit for being a sensual person , " she notes suddenly . " I 've always had a body  --  a rather nice one , too  --  but people who had only seen my movies assumed I was either sexless That 's one thing that got to me : that I repeated characters fairly often . I did n't get the Liz Taylor-type roles ; whether I would have accepted certain sexy or dramatic roles is n't the question  --  it 's just that one likes to be thought of as a well-rounded person . " Upon being offered the chance to play Mary Poppins ( originally a 50ish spinster of unattractive proportions ) in the Disney film , Julie reportedly said , " What ? Me work for that cartoon-person ? " After meeting with Disney and viewing the story board and proposed layouts for the musical fantasy , she was convinced . But most of the public tend to forget that before Poppins she appeared as a bitchy type in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garner  --  with some four-letter words thrown in . She also did the sexy , suspenseful Torn Curtain with Paul Newman for Alfred Hitchcock , as well as a partial striptease for Rock Hudson 's benefit in Darling Lili , which was condemned by the P.T.A . ' s movie guide . Although she wo n't discuss how far she goes in changing her image in 10 , she offers , " I 'm no innocent , and I look forward to more gutsy , challenging roles . I feel the public is mature enough to accept a change . " She points to Ingrid Bergman 's moving from Joan of Arc-type roles to more worldly parts and to John Travolta 's switch from G-rated TV to R-rated films . But unlike Bergman , who was involved in an international scandal , Andrews ' life is completely uneventful , blissfully ordinary . And unlike John Travolta , who was sexually deified in Saturday Night Fever and Moment by Moment , the Englishwoman would not allow herself to spend half a film 's running time in swimwear . " I suppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the anguish of those who deem themselves hapless enough to have nothing more than looks and a body . " It 's so hard to fight an image , though , " she reflects . It will be Continued on page 100 continued from page 81 harder from now on , since ABC has paid an astronomical sum to 20th Century-Fox in order to broadcast The Sound of Music yearly for about two decades . At one time , the Austrian-made extravaganza was the top-grossing movie of all time ; now it 's not even in the top five , eclipsed by such offerings as Star Wars , Superman , Jaws and The Godfather . Before long , one imagines , it will slip out of the top ten altogether . How does the star feel about that ? Apparently , she has n't lost any sleep over it . " It 's a cycle , " she says . " Nobody and nothing in this life is forever , and generations replace each other . I do n't know if many stars view movies as a way of gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , since only a few people from each century are well-remembered , and most of them do things far more important than act in a film . " Completely aware of who she is and what she represents to millions of people who still admire or even worship her , Julie is nonetheless humble and matter-of-fact . Asked by an admirer why she 's let down the public by making so few pictures in a long while , she ripostes , " I think my duty to myself and my family is greater than my duty to the public , dear . " Though she could easily afford haute couture and daily trips to the beauty salon , the woman dresses simply  --  but fetchingly  --  and her hairstyle is the dependable , comfortable tomboy cut . " I 'm all for cleanliness and looking neat and sharp , but I 'm too practical and secure now to try and impress everybody with how I dress or what shade of lipstick I wear . I 'm done trying to impress . Now I 'm just having a good , loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corny . " If a little war .
