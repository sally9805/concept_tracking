COVER STORY <P> Shirley MacLaine , at 50 , is still a rising star <P> It gets applause , even gasps , night after night . It is a simple chorus-girl kick , the torso tilting back for balance , the long , long left leg surging straight up above the head . But it is also an emblem-of a career that has gone everywhere , yet still draws its inspiration and discipline from dance , of a body that at mid-century is still supple and streamlined and surefooted . It is a kick of jubilation , of pride , perhaps of defiance . And of beauty . <P> Last year , on her 49th birthday , Shirley MacLaine wanted to be alone with her dreams . She trekked up into the Rockies near Cripple Creek , Colo. , and wished-or " projected , " as she puts it-that during the next year , the film she was making , Terms of Endearment , would win an Oscar , and so would she ; that her book on spiritualism , Out on a Limb , would become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would score a hit on Broadway . Anything can look possible to a woman who once danced an entire ballet on a broken ankle . But that almost greedy welter of ambitions might have seemed outlandish if it had been voiced in public by an actress whose early glory had faded in bad films and a scattershot career and who had said that politics or travel or a search for self-awareness meant as much to her as performing . <P> On her 50th birthday , Shirley MacLaine was in New York City , and she attended festivities all day long . Her publisher , Bantam Books , celebrated the climb of Out on a Limb to the top spot on the New York Times paperback-bestsellers list . At the 1,992-seat Gershwin Theater , where Shirley MacLaine on Broadway is grossing $475,000 a week , a house record , another bash was thrown by the show 's producers . They had heard the star telling an interviewer that the only thing she had never done was to ride an elephant . So when MacLaine arrived at the theater , she was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ringling Bros , and Barnum &; Bailey Circus . The pachyderm obligingly knelt to help MacLaine aboard- " She was so sweet and kind , " the star said-though Targa also unfurled her trunk and snatched up most of MacLaine 's chocolate birthday cake . Perhaps the most exuberant event was the Broadway song and dance itself . MacLaine showed off her Joshua's-trumpet voice , her 50-year-old legs- " 25 each , " one appreciative observer remarked-and an appendage that has been with her so often of late that it has come to seem a part of her , the at-long-last Oscar that she won for Endearment . <P> What a difference a year makes : Shirley the Survivor has become Shirley the Superstar . The aging sprite has ripened into the overpowering character actress . The unfocused dilettante has been redefined as the Renaissance woman . The lovable kook with the carefree sex life and oddball ideas has been transmuted into a role model of a self-possessed , successful woman at 50 . Shirley MacLaine , who always attracted affection , now commands respect . Her triumph is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lean , fit , happier and more attractive than ever . She has worked hard to keep limber physically and mentally , and she welcomes the birthday that saddens so many people : " I love the idea of 50 , because the best is yet to come . I am going to live to be 100 ,
