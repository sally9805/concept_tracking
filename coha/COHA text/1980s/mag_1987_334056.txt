Everyone knows that sports teams must have nicknames , but selecting an appropriate one is fraught with peril . Alabama , for instance , may be proud of the Crimson Tide , but it sounds like a bloodbath or a serious algae problem . Notre Dame 's famous jocks are ossified as the Fighting Irish , though Hibernian-American athletes are about as rare in South Bend as they are on the Boston Celtics . Nothing exposed the nickname crisis more starkly than the 1982 NCAA basketball championship game played between the Georgetown Hoyas and the North Carolina Tar Heels . Even if you know what a hoya or a tarheel is , the only sensible strategy is to forget it . ( For those overwhelmed by a need to know , hoya is short for Hoya saxa ! , a garbled Greek and Latin cheer meaning " What rocks ! , " and tarheel originated during the Civil War as a disparaging term for folks from the Carolina pine forests . ) Few knew what the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons were when a pro basketball team played under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zollner , who also happened to own a piston factory in Fort Wayne . ) The early vogue of naming a team for a person seems to have come to an end with Paul Brown , the original coach of the Cleveland Browns . Fans who found the cult of personality distasteful at least were grateful that he was n't named Stumblebrenner . <P> The Zollner Pistons eventually became the Detroit Pistons , showing that some nicknames travel well . The Brooklyn Dodgers , named for the difficulty of evading trolley cars in the famous borough , are now the Los Angeles Dodgers , where evading mayhem on the freeways is equally hard . The name Los Angeles Lakers , however , makes no sense at all , though it did when the team was in Minnesota . Utah , with its Mormon tradition , could easily have accepted the New Orleans football team ( the Saints , as in Latter-Day Saints and saints who go marching in ) . Instead it got the New Orleans basketball team , now known as the Utah Jazz , which makes about as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , nicknames are supposed to come from two categories : animals that specialize in messy predation ( lions , sharks , falcons and so forth ) or humans famous for rapine and pillage ( pirates , buccaneers , Vikings , conquistadors , bandits , raiders , etc . ) . The image of mangled flesh must be evoked , but tastefully , one reason why there are no teams named the Massacres or the Serial Murderers . The aim , of course , is to borrow ferocity , but there are signs of change . Some years ago , students at Scottsdale Community College in , but three years later students got half a loaf : the team is the Artichokes , but the colors are blue and white . Last year a similar nickname struggle took place . By 5 to 1 , students at the University of California at Santa Cruz voted to call school teams the Banana Slugs in honor of a slimy yellow gastropod that swarms over the seaside campus on rainy days . Lest anyone miss the message , pro-Slug students said they meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
