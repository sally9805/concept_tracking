Two accounts by hostages of cruelty and courage <P> Each hostage has his or her own story to tell of captivity in Iran , and the combined accounts make up a mosaic of remarkable courage during months of deprivation and degradation . To illuminate pieces of that mosaic , TIME Correspondent Christopher Redman last week interviewed Charles Jones , 40 , of Detroit and Correspondent Dean Brelis talked at length with Michael Metrinko , 34 , of Olyphant , Pa . Their reports : <P> Always in Trouble <P> " Wherever Charles goes , he takes trouble with him , " jokes Mattie Jones , wife of the only black American imprisoned for all 444 days of the crisis . The son of a public works employee , Jones joined the State Department as a communications officer in 1965 . He was stationed in Cairo in 1967 when the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War erupted . In 1975 he was one of the last Americans to flee Saigon . And then , on Aug. 23 , 1979 , he arrived in Tehran . <P> When militants stormed the American embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vault , locked the door and began destroying sensitive documents . Says Jones : " I was shredding things like mad . The militants brought one of our security officers to the door and said that if we did n't open up , they would execute him . " The Americans obeyed and were quickly bound and blindfolded . When Jones muttered his name to a blindfolded colleague , a militant tore off the silver chain around Jones ' neck . Says Jones : " He took my head , pulled it back and then smashed it into the wall . " <P> For the first few days , Jones was kept upstairs in the embassy residence . Then he and about 25 other hostages were moved to the windowless basement , which they nicknamed the Mushroom . <P> Says Jones : " We were fed like hogs . They would take us into a filthy room and feed us with dirty utensils and plates . " <P> When Jones and the others were moved from the Mushroom to the embassy 's chancellery on March 17 , 1980 - his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other black male hostages had been released in late November . Jones is convinced that the militants did not free him as well because they suspected him of espionage . Says he : <P> " I was interrogated five times . They wanted to know what I had destroyed . They wanted me to open up safes . I refused . " <P> Despite the harassment , Jones ' stay in the chancellery was fairly comfortable . He exercised daily , voraciously read westerns , science fiction and history and ate " steak , chicken and a heck of a lot of hamburgers , " all from the embassy commissary , which was well stocked at the time of the takeover . <P> That period ended abruptly after the aborted U.S. rescue mission on April 25 . <P> Guards stormed into the chancellery and blindfolded and handcuffed the Americans . Jones and four others were flown to Mashhad near the Soviet border . They spent one night in an abandoned house , then two nights in a hotel , where they had to climb ten flights of stairs to their rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By June 26 they were back in Tehran , in a prison . Finally , on Dec. 17 , Jones and his comrades were moved to a guesthouse in Tehran . <P> He and the other Americans constantly looked for omens of their release .
