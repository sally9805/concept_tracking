Tipper Gore can do something you ca n't . She can quote the loopy lyrics of a rather recherche song by W.A.S.P. : " I got pictures of naked ladies lying on my bed/ I whiff the smell of a sweet convulsion/ Thoughts are sweating inside my head/ . . . I start to howl in heat/ I . . . " and this next word presents a problem . How to handle propriety and make her point at the same time ? Spelling is the answer . She pronounces each of the four letters , then finishes , " . . . like a beast . " <P> Few people outside a core of heavy-metal diehards will know that Gore gets the lyrics a little askew . Not many others may even have heard of W.A.S.P . Tipper Gore , wife of Senator Albert Gore Jr. , and some other well-connected women in Washington are changing all that . They have banded together as Parents Music Resource Center ( P.M.R.C. ) and , with the National Parent-Teacher Association , want everyone to know that rock-'n ' - roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cashing in on shock value , and parents have said , ' That 's it  --  no further , ' " says Ann Kahn , president of the NPTA . It is not only the W.A.S.P . who stand accused . It seems as though everyone is coming down on Judas Priest , Motley Crue , AC/DC , Twisted Sister and other metal machines . Madonna is being scrutinized . So is Sheena Easton , singing about her " sugar walls , " and Sheila E. , strutting her stuff . And Prince , going on about a girl masturbating with a magazine . And Michael Jackson too . <P> Gore 's worries were fully aired in Washington last week when she and kindred spirits appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee to thrash out rock 's putative excesses . Gore faced at least one friendly face on the committee : her husband , the Democratic Senator from Tennessee . The opposition included such music-business figures as Rock Avant-Gardist Frank Zappa , John Denver , and Dee Snider of Twisted Sister . Whatever their political effects , the hearings were certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Democrat from South Carolina , announced that " the only redeeming social value " he could find in rock " is that the words are inaudible . " The P.M.R.C. 's Susan Baker , wife of Treasury Secretary James Baker , evoked a " proliferation of songs glorifying rape , sado-masochism , incest , the occult and suicide by a growing number of bands . " Zappa announced that " the complete list of P.M.R.C. demands reads like an instruction manual for some sinister kind of toilet-training program to housebreak all composers and performers . " Nebraska Democrat J. James Exon suggested ominously that " unless the music industry cleans up its act , there might well be legislation . " Singer Dee Snider showed up in tight jeans and a cut-off T shirt and fought past his nervousness to tell everyone that the band 's song Under the Blade , allegedly a glorification of S-M , was in fact about fear of surgery . " The only sado-masochism present , " he insisted , " was in Tipper Gore 's mind . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
