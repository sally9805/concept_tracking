For 28 hours , the drama played out on the world 's television screens , and for a while it seemed as if it would provoke direct U.S. military intervention in El Salvador 's ugly , decade-old civil war . Twelve Green Berets from Fort Bragg , N.C. , part of a U.S. advisory team in El Salvador , were holed up on the fourth floor of the Sheraton Hotel in San Salvador 's wealthy Escalon district , while about 20 heavily armed young guerrillas , who had seemingly blundered into the hotel , roamed the floors above and below them . <P> But there was no shoot-out . Instead , as part of an agreement brokered by the Roman Catholic Church , the guerrillas slipped away , and the U.S. soldiers , using journalists as a shield , ran from the hotel to waiting military vehicles . But so alarming was the event that President George Bush , acutely mindful that he had been seen to be dithering during October 's aborted coup in Panama , quickly convened a meeting of a National Security Council emergency group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into San Salvador . At one point Bush even made the embarrassing claim that the U.S. commandos had " liberated " the Green Berets . <P> The incident pointed up yet again that guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( F.M.L.N. ) continue to have the ability to paralyze the government of President Alfredo Cristiani and outwit the Salvadoran army . Just as the 1968 Tet offensive in Viet Nam forced Washington and the American public to question the U.S. position in Southeast Asia , the F.M.L.N . ' s latest attacks have raised fundamental doubts about the whole U.S. approach to El Salvador . <P> The slaying on Nov. 16 in San Salvador of six Jesuit priests has caused such outrage in Washington that Congress is suddenly talking about reducing U.S. aid if the Cristiani regime does not conduct a thorough investigation . Last week the House of Representatives narrowly blocked a Democratic proposal to hold back 30% of the $85 million in U.S. military aid to El Salvador this year . The events of the past two weeks also underscore U.S. intelligence failures , most notably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the scope of the rebel push , Washington officials concede that there are considerably more than the estimated total of 6,000 rebel soldiers . <P> The Sheraton siege brought the U.S. the closest it has ever been to exchanging fire with the Salvadoran guerrillas . It occurred just as the rebels ' ten-day-old offensive , which had been fought in some of the capital 's poorest neighborhoods , Soyapango , Cuidad Delgado and Mejicanos , seemed to be winding down . In the early hours of Sunday morning , hundreds of guerrillas were streaming out of Mejicanos ' streets , badly battered by days of intensive government firepower . Where the rebels went , or how they managed to elude the government troops , no one seemed to know . But two days later , they re-emerged from the gullies and ravines that border the city 's exclusive Escalon district and took control of several blocks of the neighborhood , which is filled with luxurious ranch-style homes set off by manicured lawns . As the government sent in its helicopters and light tanks , it became clear that the rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war could come to their elegant front doors . Some demonstrated their support for the government troops by sending servants out with cookies and milk .
