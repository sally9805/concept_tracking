Know what I 'm a-saying to ye , Buddy-Roe ? ( Long pause . Yancey stares at Fred . Enter , in a rush , Flo , who lives with Fred , wearing almost nothing and a pair of 19th century ladies boots. ) p. 8 FLO I do n't believe this , Fred !

( She flops herself down on the bench , starts pulling off a boot and stocking . Fred sits by her . Yancey stands watching . ) You put me in a bustle and I look exactly like I 'm riding two pigs making it under a sheet . He says its period and it 's his ass as well as mine getting seen in this production , so I wear the bustle . O God , my foot , this boot ! Like I 'm wearing a jaw !

FLO Oh ! It 's an improvisation . FRED Right . Improvise . YANCEY What about you , actor ? What do YOU want ? I 'm gon na tell you what you want . You want to leave yore awful self , to escape a-running from the miseries of a plank-plain life , into this other new way of walking , this other new way of talking , with a new voice and a new tongue , new legs and dancing hands , no longer yore old wretched self , but born again , in spotlights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about every actor I know . FLO Go , Yancey ! Do it ! Give us some sin ! S  --  FLO &amp; FRED i  --  n . Sin ! ( He does n't have to be told . Yancey 's stiff body becomes pliant and supple . His wooden voice melts into real eloquence . He is transported : a baby preacher in the rough. ) p. 11 YANCEY I will ! I will ! Sin you want ! Sin you get ! But not when you think you 're happy , in your glory ! FLO &amp; FRED ( Clapping . ) GLORY ! YANCEY Not DANCING and SINGING ! FLO &amp; FRED ( Clapping . ) DANCING and SINGING !

YANCEY From HIM , who loves you not for yore singing , or for yore dancing , or for your shining youth a-gleaming in the sun , but for yore lonely self , what you jest plain ARE , in that well-bottom creek-bed of yore soul ! O lover ! O dancer ! O saint ! O sinner ! Yearning , thirsty , hungry , feeble , feverish and dying , far from God , who is yore home ! ! ( A pause . All three look at each other , astonished . Yancey blinks , comes to , as if he has been in a trance . Then Yancey smiles , a great huge joyous grin of relief and discovery. )                                                           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
