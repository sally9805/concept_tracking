Fugitives are set free <P> It had been one of the largest and most successful man hunts in American history . In an operation that culminated last month , the U.S. Marshals Service joined forces with California law-enforcement agencies to track down 2,116 fugitives , using such scams as an ersatz parcel-delivery service to lure the criminals out of hiding . Most of those snared by FIST ( fugitive investigative strike team ) were being sought for violent crimes , and on the average each of the quarries had five felony counts on his record . <P> Within weeks of the arrests , almost half of those felons were back on the street , having been released on bail , freed on then " own recognizance or placed on probation . The irony is that many of them had been arrested because they had previously jumped bond , violated parole , fled jail or failed to show up in court to face earlier charges . Among the newly liberated : a 25-year-old Oakland man with 26 earlier arrests for grand theft and selling narcotics ; a 22-year-old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with children ; and a 21-year-old drug dealer with a previous arrest record . <P> Marshals Director Stanley Morris complains that limited prison space forced judges to turn loose the arrested fugitives . But , he says , " the fugitives pose a serious threat to society and should be dealt with firmly . "
