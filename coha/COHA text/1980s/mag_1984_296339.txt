Books , movies and television have long provided a glamorous gloss for the image of the foreign correspondent . Heit has traditionally been a he-dashes from one cosmopolitan capital to another by first-class jetliner or Orient Express-style railway compartment ; he puts up at such elegant hostelries as Claridge 's in London or the Plaza Athne in Paris , dining at Maxim 's or its local equivalent ; he hobnobs with celebrities and is on intimate terms with heads of government . <P> This stereotype of glamour and prestige never seems so unreal as when a correspondent is confronted by overwhelming , stomach-wrenching misery and death . New Delhi Bureau Chief Dean Brelis faced such a scene last week when he arrived in Bhopal , India , just 30 hours after a toxic gas leak had created the world 's worst industrial disaster . " I have seen men killed in battle , " Brelis reported after walking through streets littered with the corpses of people and animals . " But seeing ordinary people dying before your eyes , especially mute children falling dead in a transfixed silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering through a landscape of the dead . " <P> Journalists never forget their landscapes of the dead . Photographer David Burnett , on assignment for TIME , spent five days last month at two of the camps set up for Ethiopia 's starving population . Says he : " It is not the millions who really batter at your emotions . It is each individual person , like the little naked girl I photographed sitting on a rock : she was not strong enough to stand , not strong enough even to eat . I still see her face . " Burnett was also struck by individual images of compassion . " There were so many loving moments , a mother with her baby , a father protecting two children . We tend to think all human feelings die under such circumstances , but I felt a little less hopeless when I saw that it was n't so . " <P> Mexico City Correspondent Janice Simpson was similarly moved when she covered the gas-tank explosion three weeks ago that left more than 2,500 dead . " People who had suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell their stories , " she says . " But I felt a great frustration at having so little to offer them in return . " The day after the explosion , Simpson went to a center where names of the missing could be checked against computer lists . Some distraught people took her for an official and asked her to aid them . " I told the first one or two that I was a reporter and could not help , " says Simpson . " But I soon found myself explaining how to make out a list and submit it . It was a very small thing , but it did make me feel a little better . "
