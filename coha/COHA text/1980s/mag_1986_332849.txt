Nobody has ever become a frequent flyer by booking a seat on GPA . For that matter , no passenger has ever eaten a meal served by a GPA flight attendant or checked a bag with the company . Yet Shannon , Ireland-based GPA , formerly known as Guinness Peat Aviation , owns one of the world 's largest commercial passenger jet fleets . Instead of flying its planes , which will soon number 187 , GPA leases them to some 25 airlines , including Pan American , Qantas and People Express . For cash-strapped carriers , renting a Boeing 737 , even at $240,000 a month , is often more affordable than spending $28 million to buy one . <P> GPA is only one of a growing number of middlemen in the airline industry . Like GPA , which is privately held , most are obscure . International Lease Finance ( 1985 sales : $81.2 million ) , for example , was begun in 1973 by three Hungarian immigrants who now employ ten staffers in a Beverly Hills office suite . But these lessors have become familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1980 only four of Boeing 's 316 orders were placed by leasing companies ; during the first half of 1986 , their share skyrocketed to 109 out of 247 . Overall , more than $10 billion worth of aircraft will be out on lease this year , up from $8.4 billion in 1985 . Says James Halstead , an airline expert at the London-based James Capel brokerage firm : " Leasing provides the most convenient form of financing new planes . " <P> Indeed , leasing companies exist largely because airlines want to replace their aging fleets faster than their budgets will allow . Says Robert Joedicke , who follows the airlines for New York City 's Shearson Lehman Bros. : " The price tag on new planes has become so expensive that leasing has become a necessity . " But even airlines with a healthy cash flow would often rather lease than buy . Reason : they fear that after spending a fortune on today 's state-of-the-art jets , they may be overtaken by tomorrow 's technology . <P> The leasing industry has flourished in part because the deregulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ill afford to buy new aircraft . Tempe , Ariz. - based America West got off the ground by leasing ten Boeing 737s  --  its entire fleet . Says America West President Michael Conway : " Without leasing , we would have had to raise a lot more money . " <P> Business has also been good in other parts of the globe . Several new Third World carriers , including Nigeria Airways and Air Lanka , have become GPA customers thanks to an enticing package offered by Tony Ryan , the company 's innovative chairman . Ryan , 50 , will supply neophyte airlines not only with planes but with flight and ground crews as well . <P> In some cases , airlines lease planes to other carriers , especially when encountering financial turbulence . Since it announced plans to reorganize last month , People Express has repainted and leased eight of its 737s . Last week Eastern Air Lines canceled its Miami-to-London route and said it may lease the DC-10 that has been idled.                @ @ @ @ @
