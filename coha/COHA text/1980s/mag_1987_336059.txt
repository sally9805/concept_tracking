A raid on an after-hours " blind pig " bar in Detroit , a scuffle between a Newark cabdriver and the police  --  these were the flash points 20 years ago as the summer of 1967 erupted into the Fire This Time . Ghetto despair gave way to grotesque destruction : 43 dead in Detroit , 26 killed in Newark , injuries and arrests in the thousands . By September more than 100 cities had been scarred by rioting , an alphabetical roster of shame that stretched from Atlanta , Boston and Cincinnati to Tampa and Toledo . National Guardsmen patrolled the streets , and a federal commission probed the causes . <P> Out of the ashes came pious promises from politicians and the rhetoric of renewed resolve . " The only genuine long-range solution for what has happened lies in an attack  --  mounted at every level  --  upon the conditions that breed despair and violence , " proclaimed President Lyndon Johnson . No one seriously thought the inner city could be transformed overnight . But few were cynical enough to envision what actually happened : an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rich nation went from bad to almost unimaginably worse . <P> " You tell me what went wrong , " asks Jonas Walker , 33 , at the end of another long summer 's day of hanging out on a street corner in Liberty City , a ghetto north of downtown Miami . " We got civil rights , we got welfare , " he says . " But look around here . " For emphasis , he kicks at a pile of empty beer cans littering the sidewalk . A high school dropout , Walker gave up his last job , bagging groceries , two years ago . " When I was growing up in Mississippi , we were poor all right , but we did n't have the madness , " Walker recalls . " Now we 're just stuck here in this poor-ass ghetto , watching Oprah Winfrey on TV and listening to the damn gunshots at night . " <P> What went wrong for the 4 million black Americans still trapped in festering inner-city ghettos ? Why do one-third of all black families remain mired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenagers 40% ? Why are 60% of all black children born out of wedlock ? And why has the American ghetto become a self-perpetuating nightmare of fatherless children , welfare dependency , crime , gangs , drugs and despair ? <P> Theories abound , but answers remain elusive . Perhaps the most promising approach grows out of the work of Black Sociologist William Julius Wilson of the University of Chicago , who popularized the concept of the underclass in his 1978 book The Declining Significance of Race . Wilson and his philosophical allies reject the simplistic single-factor theories of cause and effect , which range from the permissiveness of welfare to the pervasiveness of racism . Instead , they stress the ever widening social and economic gap between ghetto residents and the rest of American society , both white and black .
