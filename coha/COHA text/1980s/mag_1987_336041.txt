Counting the woeful Colts , Indianapolis seems to have grabbed up most of the amateur athletics in the country and , for the past two weeks , has gone international as the tenth host of the quadrennial Pan American Games . Sort of a hemispheric Olympics , though with moderate attendance and meager television ratings , the Pan Am Games provide a warm-up for both pole vaulters and political commentators , as well as an opportunity to avoid the crowds and defect early . So far , ten Dominicans have absconded to New York City . <P> A dead shot from the Chilean shooting team ( and intelligence community ) has been denied a visa for being too deadly , and the elegant Cuban baseball players have had to duck leaflets , airplane streamers and a brigade of fat bench jockeys in BAY OF PIGS T shirts . Worse than that , Cuba 's team lost to the Americans , 6-4 . By the gold-medal count , Cuba ( 51 ) and the U.S. ( 104 ) are already assured of second and first place , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguous . <P> In a lovely incongruity , weight lifters took over the symphony hall , and to a harpist 's rendition of The Harmonious Blacksmith , Cuban-born Roberto ( " Tony " ) Urrutia tried his hand as an American . The three-time world champion , who defected seven years ago on the end of a bedsheet in Mexico City , finished third in the middleweight class to two former countrymen . Fidel Castro sent them his congratulations : " You taught an exemplary lesson to the traitor . " Urrutia declared he was glad to be free , " like a bird , " but the / medal ceremony was bittersweet . " When I hear the national anthem , " he said wistfully , " of course I feel like a Cuban . " By the time the last weight was lowered , that anthem had lifted the hall 25 times . <P> Four years ago in Venezuela , just the rumor of revolutionary new steroid tests sent U.S. musclemen stampeding back to the airport . But , as expressed by Ohio Hammer Thrower Jud Logan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , after a Pan Am record throw of 253 ft. 5 in . " I like things fair . " From the tiny Utah archer Denise Parker , 13 , who won a gold medal , to the statuesque Costa Rican swimmer Silvia Poll , 16 , teenage girls were the fairest of them all . The daughter of a German businessman who made his way to Costa Rica through Nicaragua , Poll is the biggest ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) , blondest and best freestyler in all of Central America . She won a fistful of her country 's inaugural medals , including three golds , and was n't finished yet . <P> Suriname won its first gold medal ever at the pool . Anthony Nesty 's record swim in the 100-meter butterfly brought out a bright national banner with the wonderful slogan A DIRT WAGON CARRIES DIRT , BUT IT DOES NOT CARRY SHAME . There were old names too . Saving her heptathlon for the coming world championships in Rome , the regal Jackie Joyner-Kersee focused on the long jump and equaled East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Carl Lewis standing by for his own turn at the long jump and Greg Louganis still perched on his diving pedestal , thoughts of 1984 were unavoidable .
