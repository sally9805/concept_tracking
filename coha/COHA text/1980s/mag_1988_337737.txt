Kate Simon 's travel books and her autobiographical portraits , Bronx Primitive and A Wider World , are admired for their good sense , wit and pithy grace . These qualities serve her well as a popular historian of a period that has set the Western world 's standards for art , culture , cynical statecraft and consumer spending . The legacy of the Italian Renaissance is never far from contemporary tastes ; its style and egocentricities survive wherever easy money , ambition and ideas flourish . Lofty mindedness and low animal cunning rarely had a better stage on which to interact . As Simon puts it , " The susurrus of silks dragging through pools of blood , chivalric elegance living with bestiality in high places , the silver rose boxed with the dagger , fidelity bedded with perfidy , remain a collage whose fascination has never quite faded .

It was a good time for architects , painters , goldsmiths , furniture makers , costume designers and jewelers . According to the historian Charles Osman , Pope Leo X was so totally preoccupied with beauty and culture that his contemporaries " doubted even if he were a good Christian , but were certain that he was a good art-critic .

Simon estimates that 700 paintings by these and other masters were sold , and eventually found various ways into the world 's museums . One immovable prize was the Gonzaga pleasure palace at Te , the walls and ceilings of which bloomed with mural paintings that were forerunners of the mannerist style . <P> Even earlier , the lives of Mantua 's rich and famous had grown so excessive that Cardinal Ercole , a Gonzaga , ordered controls . " His new rules , " writes Simon , " called for severe restrictions in the consumption of peacocks , pheasants , and other game birds ; only two kinds of roast and poultry were to be served at one time ; no fish or oysters were to be offered with meats ; dishes were not to be ornamented with figurines , fine inlays , bits of gold , as was the court custom .
