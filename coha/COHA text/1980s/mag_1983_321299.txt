Reagan is rescued by one Ruckelshaus , blasted by another <P> When the Administration was frantically trying to stop the cascading scandals at the Environmental Protection Agency last winter , the President turned to William Ruckelshaus for help . Ruckelshaus became the new EPA administrator , and the White House has begun to relax as the Republican with the " Mr. Clean " image has started to restore order to the shattered agency . " I want to make people feel good about where they work , " he says . " The EPA has always been an agency whose people have a great deal of pride . Despite all the recent turbulence , the pride is still there . " <P> It was one of those ironic twists of Washington political life that Reagan was attacked by one Ruckelshaus even as he was rescued by another . Jill Ruckelshaus , Bill 's strong-minded and outspoken wife , has been in the vanguard of frequent anti-Reagan reports that issue from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights . Last month the commission accused Reagan of not appointing enough women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation of sex discrimination at private and public schools and colleges . <P> Along with Elizabeth and Bob Dole , the Ruckelshauses have become one of the most visible and influential husband-and-wife teams in Washington . In contrast to Jill , Bill has been a quiet team player , moving to rehabilitate the EPA 's reputation and employee morale , which were damaged by a spate of congressional investigations into political favoritism , conflict of interest and mismanagement of the toxic-waste program under former Chief Anne Burford . <P> Ruckelshaus , who was the EPA 's first administrator from 1970 to 1973 , has issued new standards of conduct for relations with industry representatives , called for a uniform policy for assessing and coping with the risks of toxic chemicals , and stanched the budget cuts that critics charged were crippling enforcement programs . The new director has impressed White House officials , even the few who were initially reluctant to bring him aboard . " It 's a measure of how much Reagan needed Bill , " a friend of Ruckelshaus points out , " because he knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 , Jill Ruckelshaus is not a typical political wife . She holds a master 's degree in education from Harvard . She prefers backyard basketball to black-tie dinners , and a quiet family life in a Seattle suburb to the social whirl of Washington , D.C. A decade ago , her vocal support of women 's rights earned her the nickname " the Gloria Steinem of the Republican Party . " <P> The recent discrimination flap was not the first time that Jill , who was appointed to the Civil Rights Commission by Jimmy Carter in 1980 , has tangled with Reagan . Last year the President attempted to sack her , then backed down . She was due to be replaced again this year , but then her husband joined the Reagan team . Said an Administration official : " It would hardly be the thing to do to boot out the wife of your EPA director . "
