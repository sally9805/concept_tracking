One day in May , Ralph S. Neas , executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights , was riding up an escalator at the McPherson Square subway stop in downtown Washington . Jerry Giovaniello , a lobbyist for the National Association of Realtors , was riding down . Sighting Mr. Neas , he called out , asking the civil rights leader to wait for him at the top of the escalator. // Their two organizations had been bitter rivals for many years over the issue of legislation on fair housing , but now Mr. Giovaniello had a message to deliver . If some technical problems could be worked out with enforcement , he said , the real estate agents were ready to back attempts to strengthen the housing statute that had become law 20 years ago. // // Strong , Selfish Reasons // Mr. Neas remembers being startled , and suspicious . But the encounter set in motion a chain of events that led to an extraordinary scene on Capitol Hill June 21 . The realtors , the civil rights conference and a dozen lawmakers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights issues - held a press conference to endorse a compromise on the bill on fair housing. // The bargain was possible , all parties agree , because they all had strong , selfish reasons : The realtors were tired of charges that they condoned discrimination and wanted to refurbish their public image ; Republicans , led by Vice President Bush , wanted to demonstrate a commitment to civil rights before the November election ; civil rights advocates , worried about the dwindling days of the legislative calendar , were willing to make concessions in order to capitalize on election-year pressures . <> <> ' Trusted by Everyone ' // The key role was played by Representative Hamilton Fish Jr , of upstate New York , the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee who had long supported civil rights causes and maintained close ties to Vice President Bush . It was his task to knit together all the threads of compromise during protracted meetings and telephone calls. // " For something like this to work out , there ' s got to be someone who is trusted by everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal person to engage in shuttle diplomacy. " // The bill is likely to pass the House this week and go to the Senate , where it enjoys broad bipartisan support . Civil rights activists are worried that some hard-line conservatives , supported by allies in the Justice Department , could try to derail the measure in the Senate , but leaders in both parties expect it to pass this summer . <> <> Filibuster Sidestepped // While President Reagan has not yet promised to sign the bill , he called it a " significant step forward " last week , and Mr. Bush is openly urging the President to support it. // The measure grew out of the landmark statute passed in 1968 , after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and the capital was bloodied by riots . That bill banned housing discrimination against racial minorities. but its enforcement provisions were emasculated in order to avoid a filibuster in the Senate. // Under the old statute , when a case of discrimination is alleged , the Department of Housing and Urban Development is only empowered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case to court . Only the agrieved individuals can bring suit , a costly and complicated process . The Justice Department can0enter some cases , but only when they discern a " pattern or practice " of discrimination , a hard standard to prove . Trial by Judge or Jury ? The key issue was how to enforce the standard . A bill passed by the House Judiciary Committee in late April set up a procedure under which administrative law judges , not the Federal courts , would evaluate complaints and set penalties. // This process troubled the realtors , who argued that the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution guaranteed a jury trial to anyone facing a penalty that exceeded $20 . But in the subway meeting with Mr. Neas , Mr. Giovaniello stressed that if the jury trial issue could be worked out , the realtors would back the bill. // In 1980 , the realtors had strenuously opposed any compromise , but new and more flexible leadership had recently taken over the national association . " We kept being set up as the people doing all the discrimination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad guys . " <> <> A Political Bruising // Meanwhile , according to his advisers , Vice President Bush was feeling politically bruised by his decision to support the President ' s veto of a bill extending the reach of anti-discrimination measures and enacted over the veto. // As a result , the Vice President called Mr. Fish and urged him to pursue a compromise . So did Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois , the Republican leader , and Samuel R. Pierce Jr. , the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development . " Everyone recognized this was a political issue , " said a senior Republican Congressman . " Everyone wanted this to sail through so we could get credit for a solid civil rights bill . " <> <> Housing Shortage Cited // In mid-May , about the time of the subway encounter , the civil rights groups were also talking compromise . Althea T. L. Simmons , chief lobbyist for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , said the glaring shortage of rental housing across the country was straining minority families and creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May , Mr. Fish met with the civil rights groups and presented his own proposal for an enforcement mechanism : Once the administrative law judge ruled , he suggested , the losing party could appeal to the courts . When the groups rejected the idea as too cumbersome , the lawmaker told them to come up with an alternative. // Just before the Memorial Day holiday , a half-dozen civil rights lawyers met for a strategy session . At one point , Penda Hair , a young lawyer for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund , startled the group by announcing , " I ' ve got it . " <> <> One Step Circumvented // Ms. Hair ' s idea was a simple one : After the housing department conducts an initial investigation of a bias complaint , and if it finds cause to proceed further , either party to the dispute should be allowed to choose a jury trial . There was no need , she said , to go through the administrative law judge first. // " Everyone agrees , " said one participant in the meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I ' ve got it. ' " // After Memorial Day , the civil rights advocates presented the idea to Mr. Fish , who approved it . A few days later , on June 7 , Mr. Neas and Wade Henderson , a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union , had lunch with Mr. Giovaniello and two colleagues from the realtors group. // It was a " very spirited exchange , " Mr. Neas said , but by the end both sides had agreed on the outlines of the compromise . " I look back on that lunch as a historic meeting , " Mr. Neas said . " Adversaries for the last decade had finally gotten together . " <> <> ' We Really Have a Deal ' // Still , many details needed to be worked out . On June 14 , the civil rights groups and the realtors met in Mr. Fish ' s Capitol Hill office . The next day , the final problems were resolved . Ms. Simmons remembers saying to the realtors , " Now , gentlemen , are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Simmons recalls saying , " Gentlemen , now we really have a deal . But nobody is going to believe us. " // " The chemistry was right , " said Mr. Fish . " It was an opportunity nobody wanted to miss . It might never happen again. " //
