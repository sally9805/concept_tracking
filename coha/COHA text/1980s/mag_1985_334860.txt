The Germans are really strange people . With their profound thoughts and ideas , which they seek everywhere and project into everything , they make life harder for themselves than they should . <P>  --  Goethe <P> At Checkpoint Charlie , the hideous maw of the Berlin Wall gapes briefly , affording a narrow passage into the divided German soul . On its Western side , a sea of sensuous color rushes down the Kurfurstendamm , past the ruins of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church , and spends itself violently but impotently in a scatological orgy of graffiti against the cold barrier . On the Eastern side , a pall hangs over the city , reflected in the rigorously functional , regimented gray apartment blocks that line the streets . Propelled by the engine of the postwar Wirtschaftswunder , the capitalist Federal Republic of Germany is a sporty blond racing along the autobahns in a glittering Mercedes-Benz . The Communist German Democratic Republic , bumping down potholed roads in proletarian Wartburgs and Russian-built Ladas , is her homely sister , a war bride locked in a loveless marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where remainders of German defeat , shame and partition are visible everywhere , is finding cultural solace and renewed pride in its heroes and native sons . In 1983 , on the 500th anniversary of his birth , East Germany celebrated Martin Luther . Today , in their tercentenary year , it praises George Frideric Handel and Johann Sebastian Bach , the two greatest composers of the Baroque . Here , where the lives and paths of such men as Luther , Handel , Bach , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Richard Wagner intersect , the glory , unity and tragedy of German history are a living memory . <P> Linked forever by a happy accident that saw them born within a month of each other in cities only 80 miles apart , Bach and Handel make an odd couple . Handel , whose 300th birthday was last month , was the son of a Halle barber- surgeon who wanted his boy to study law . A well-traveled cosmopolitan , he settled in London , anglicized his name from Handel , and became the dominant operatic and oratorio composer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74 , he was buried with great ceremony in Poet 's Corner at Westminster Abbey . By contrast , Bach , whose birthday falls this week , came from a long line of musicians and spent almost his entire life in what is now East Germany in the often contentious service of pompous princelings and severe Lutheran rectors . He married twice , fathered 20 children , and died far more renowned for his keyboard playing than for his mostly unpublished cantatas , Masses , sonatas and concertos . <P> Modern history has drastically reversed the judgment that earlier generations made of the two composers . A poll taken in the mid-18th century would undoubtedly have found Handel the more admired , especially in England , where his German-accented ghost smothered native British music for more than a century . Bach was considered an outdated figure working in a dying contrapuntal medium of four-part harmony and abstruse fugues . " The old wig " his son Johann Christian is said to have called him .                 @ @ @ @
