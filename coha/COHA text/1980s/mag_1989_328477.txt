The prodigal son hesitantly calls his father from a phone booth in the rain . He wants to come home . Ecstatic Dad rings up his other son to pass on the good news . But Son No. 2 is n't too happy and calls up Mom to gripe . Mom suggests , " Call him . " What 's going on ? Will the next phone call explain the family feud ? <P> Watch out , Dallas and Dynasty .

Besides , if viewers must cling to the edge of their seats awaiting the next installment , when will they find time to raid the refrigerator ?               @ @ @ @ @ @
