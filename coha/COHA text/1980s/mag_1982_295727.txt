COVER STORIES " We Are in an Emergency " Mexico 's new President opts for austerity , efficiency and , above all , honesty <P> The change in style could hardly have been more telling . Almost every day at about 8:30 a.m. last week , a burgundy Ford station wagon and a white Dodge escorted by two police motorcycles pulled away from Mexico City 's southern suburb of Coyoacn . The modest motorcade traveled unobtrusively , inching along in the morning rush hour 's endless traffic snarl and dutifully stopping at every traffic light . Finally , about 30 minutes later , it would arrive at the massive and ornate National Palace . A short , handsome figure with graying hair at his temples would emerge : it was the new President of Mexico , Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado . Unlike his predecessor , Jos Lpez Portillo , who commuted to the National Palace by flag-waving motorcade or helicopter , De la Madrid suffered the same delays and irritations as his fellow citizens . <P> Another sign of change that all Mexico noted came when De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Supreme Court . By tradition , the Justices are supposed to walk to the National Palace to offer their greetings to the incoming President . This time , De la Madrid walked to the Supreme Court building . When he arrived , he avoided speeches and ceremonies . Instead , he briefly informed the Justices of two changes he wanted in the Mexican constitution , changes that would make it easier to prosecute corrupt government officials . <P> Throughout his first week in office , as he assumed the powers he will hold as President of Mexico for the next six years , De la Madrid acted like a man eager to set a new tone . His aim : to impose austerity , efficiency and , above all , " moral renovation " -a euphemism for honesty-upon a nation battered by economic troubles and demoralized by the latter-day excesses of Lpez Portillo . <P> No other country has a greater stake hi De la Madrid 's success than the U.S. Never in more than a half-century has the U.S. faced even the faintest threat of political instability or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That prospect , no matter how remote , has inspired a blend of acute concern and well-intentioned sympathy for Mexico 's plight . Says U.S. Ambassador to Mexico John Gavin : " We want Mexico to be free , and we want Mexico to be prosperous . Why ? Enlightened self-interest . " <P> In the days after his inauguration , De la Madrid asked the 400-member National Congress to broaden the government 's powers to crack down on graft . He announced a sharp cut in government subsidies for such basic commodities as sugar and gasoline . He sent a draconian budget to the Congress , calling for a $ 12 billion , or 50% , cut in the budget deficit for 1983 . He also proposed an ambitious plan for government decentralization to help prevent urban paralysis in Mexico City , one of the world 's most congested ( pop . 16 million ) and polluted capitals . The President then made a whirlwind tour of Mexico 's southern state of Chiapas , giving the colorfully dressed Indian residents of the remote region a first glimpse of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He is acting so quickly that many people are stunned .
