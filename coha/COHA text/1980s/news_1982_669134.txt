While Lena Scofield , of Citra , Fla. , took her driver ' s test , 12-year-old Dorothy ( Dee ) Scofield , the youngest of her five children , crossed the road to shop for a birthday gift for her brother , Joe . Mother and daughter would meet when both were done. // They never met . Dee disappeared . Her frantic mother searched everywhere . Yes , Dee had been seen buying a gift . Then  --  nothing . That was six years ago . The stricken mother has not seen her little girl since. // The Scofield family is not alone in its grief. // Every year , an estimated 50 , 000 children nationwide are criminally abducted while playing in their yards , going to or from school , riding bikes , camping , doing errands , being cared for by baby sitters , doing all the perfectly ordinary things all children do . Many are never heard from again. // ( This figure does not include an additional 150 , 000 children ' ' snatched ' ' from one parent by another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year. ) // Parents have felt alone and frustrated , and at a loss as to how to help one another and find solutions to this horror. // But there now are signs that all this is changing. // Families are banding together to find ways to prevent as many criminal abductions as possible and find missing children more quickly. // Among other things , they are : // * Lobbying for passage of a national Missing Children Act to establish a clearinghouse of information , using a computer to help track missing children and to identify the remains of 5 , 000 unclaimed bodies found each year , many of which are of children. // * Making joint appearances to testify for legislation and to explain the enormity of the problem to the public . In December , for example , parents Rosemary Kohm , Julie Patz , Camille Bell , and John Walsh appeared before a national symposium in Louisville , Ky. , dealing with problems of child pornography , prostitution , abduction , and murder. // * Building a network of support groups to offer comfort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in criminal abductions is the knowledge that they almost always involve foul play , including sexual abuse or exploiting the child through pornography and prostitution. // Despite outpourings of sympathy from outraged communities and compassionate people , parents often find themselves isolated and sometimes even shunned or blamed by the insensitive few . Many parents have had to withstand implications that they were somehow careless , as if a child should never be allowed out of sight. // Such callousness , they say , is hard enough to bear . But even worse is the shock that comes when they turn to the police only to find , all too often , that the immediate and wide-ranging help they expect is not available or not available in time. // Many police departments will not begin to search for a missing child for 24 hours on the presumption that the child will ' ' turn up ' ' or that he has deliberately run away . However , in case after case where children have never been found or were found killed or injured , parents say this delay was crucial - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abductors came too late . The FBI will not enter a case unless there is a ransom note - proof there has been a kidnapping - or evidence the victim has been transported across state lines . There seems to be no clear mandate for the involvement of national law enforcement agencies . And local police , left with the problem , often lack the manpower or equipment to be effective. // Until recently , many families have had to virtually go it alone , augmenting police searches with their own , often meager resources . They have passed out leaflets , hired private detectives when they could afford to do so , and begged for attention from the local news media . In some cases that attention has been forthcoming . In others , parents were told their problem ' ' is too common ' ' to single out one child from the many who are missing in a particular city. // In the past decade , the United States has witnessed many multiple murders of children with little or no attention to the individual child until the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta ; 27 in Houston ; 14 in California ; 7 in Detroit. // One of the pioneer support groups that parents of missing or murdered children have begun is the Dee Scofield Awareness Program Inc . ( DEE ) , in Tampa . It was established in 1976 by the victim ' s aunt , Mrs. Betty DiNova , and her daughter-in-law , Mrs. Ivana DiNova. // ' ' We decided we had to do something , even if it was too late to help Dee , ' ' says Betty DiNova , who conducts the project from her Tampa home . Until recently , when local churches began helping her with telephone bills , printing , and postage costs , all expenses ' ' came out of our own pockets , ' ' she says. // The DEE organization , and others like it , compiles data on individual cases from newspaper accounts and referrals from other agencies and individuals ; sends out literature and fact sheets to educate the public ; provides a checklist of ' ' things to do when your child disappears ' ' ; participates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to redress conditions that hamper searches. // DEE urges the elimination of bail and parole for accused child molesters and child murderers , and encourages parents to voluntarily have their children fingerprinted at local police agencies . This is done in Hillsborough County , Fla. , by volunteers with training and supervision from the sheriff ' s department . Under the plan , spearheaded by the Limona Parent Teachers Association , parents keep the fingerprints in a safe place for identification purposes if needed. // ( Mandatory fingerprinting of children is opposed by some groups , which see it as an invasion of a child ' s civil rights. ) // One of the newest support groups is the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . It grew out of a voluntary group that has provided child advocacy in the area for almost a decade. // One of the center ' s first activities was to establish and maintain a computer file of missing children from information supplied by the Broward sheriff ' s office . There are 150 cases at present. // The Adam Walsh Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal grant from the Juvenile Justice Department. // John and Reve Walsh serve on the board . The Walshes did much to bring the missing-children issue to national attention with their appearances on network TV shows during the two-week search for their murdered only child , Adam. // The Walshes are spearheading a drive for passage of a Federal Missing Children Act , introduced in the Senate ( S1701 ) by Paula Hawkins ( R ) of Florida and the House ( HR 3781 ) by Paul Simon ( D ) of Illinois ) . Hearings have been held in both chambers . The proposed legislation would require the FBI to maintain a national computer information network to assist law enforcement agencies in locating and identifying missing childen and other individuals . This bill covers all missing children including runaways and those who are kidnapped or who are victims of parental abduction . There is no restriction on how long the child must be missing before authorities can act . In addition , the bill would set up a national clearinghouse for information about bodies found without identification. // The bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Department on proposed amendments . Senator Hawkins hopes the bill will come before both houses before the August recess. // The FBI has objections to the bill but is working with Senator Hawkins ' s staff to iron out differences . The FBI is concerned that worried parents will come directly to it and fail to contact local police . However , an amendment to the bill allows parents to list a child in the FBI Missing Persons File only after contacting local police and if police fail to list the child. // FBI spokesmen point out that a nationwide Missing Persons File has actually existed since 1975 . But they stress that their Missing Persons File is for distributing information only . There is a misapprehension among parents , they say , that once notified , the FBI will begin an investigation . But the FBI has no jurisdiction in missing-child cases unless there is evidence of an abduction . The problem , as they see it , is that the existing system has not been utilized. // According to Senator Hawkins only about 10 percent of the missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Crime Information Center computer. // As a further step , the FBI says , it now supports establishing an unidentified dead file. // John Walsh says : ' ' We are not asking for a national police force to search for every missing child . We are just asking for a centralized system and that the FBI assist , whenever possible , when a sighting of a child is out of state and the local police can ' t follow up that lead . It ' s not too much to ask of this great society. ' ' // Julie Patz , whose son , Etan , disappeared on his way to his school bus stop in Manhattan , didn ' t know for six hours that he had never boarded his bus . She would like to see an attendance reporting system so parents would be notified at once if their children did not reach school. // Parents of missing children are pressing hard for the Missing Children Act to become law . They point out that whenever a car , a boat , or other possessions are reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationwide almost at once. // Why , they ask , can ' t the same be done for missing children ? // //
