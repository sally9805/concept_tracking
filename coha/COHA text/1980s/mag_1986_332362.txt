The computer common room in Bell Laboratories ' six-story brick quarters in Murray Hill , N.J. , is strewn with a herd of toy sheep , an assortment of plastic ducks and a glass beaker that contains a Madagascar hissing cockroach . Walking along one of the facility 's narrow , institutional-green corridors , Mathematician Ronald Graham effortlessly juggles six spinning white balls . Some days the balls are black . Not long ago , in a nearby office , a shimmying belly dancer tried to perk up a brooding scientist who was convinced that he had lost his zest for research . Since its founding on New Year 's Day 1925 , Bell Labs  --  AT &T's; peerless research and development arm  --  has been bubbling with creative unorthodoxy . " To work here , " says one researcher , " you have to let your hair down and be a free spirit . " <P> You also have to be brilliant . Of the 20,000 people employed by Bell Labs in 19 facilities spread throughout the nation , 2,769 are Ph.D.s . " The brainpower around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to the Murray Hill branch , where a force of 3,200 does much of Bell 's basic research . " This is like a university with a faculty of 500 physicists . If all of us took off and went to different universities , we would n't have the same impact . " But clumped together , like uranium fuel rods in a reactor , the physicists and other Murray Hillers form what Physicist Douglas Osheroff calls a " critical mass . " <P> The ensuing chain reaction has changed modern society . Over the span of 60 years , Bell Labs has generated 21,000 patents , one for each of the institution 's working days and then some . More than mere inventions , the patents cover breakthroughs that have launched entire industries  --  developments such as the transistor , the solar cell and satellite TV . Meanwhile , scientists at Bell have raked in seven Nobel prizes and , in the process , inspired some legends . <P> In an event that came to be called the " well-known accident , " Clinton Davisson and his colleague Lester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial aspect of quantum theory . Davisson noticed that a stream of electrons beamed at a crystal of pure nickel was diffracted , a phenomenon that is characteristic of light waves . Electrons had been thought to exist only as sub-atomic particles until , just a few years before Davisson 's observation , the newly developing quantum theory suggested that electrons could behave as both particles and waves . Here was proof , and it won Davisson a Nobel in 1937.
