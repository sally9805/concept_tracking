But Carter 's actions are not likely to free the hostages <P> Once again he let the thunder peal : <P> " We take this break in relations as a good omen . Iranians have forced an oppressive superpower to terminate its pillage here . The nation is justified in celebrating the advent of victory ! " <P> So declared the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini last week in response to what almost any other nation would have considered a jolting setback . The President of the U.S. had just imposed historic diplomatic and economic sanctions on Iran , including the expulsion of 35 Iranian diplomats , and had asked American allies to join in isolating Khomeini 's government . But in turbulent Iran , where the U.S. and its President are routinely denounced as " Satan , " surrealism reigns , and any clash with Americans has become a cause for jubilation . All week long , Muslim leaders whipped up an emotional frenzy against the U.S. , reaching an even higher pitch after border clashes occurred with Iraq . " The U.S. hand has come out of Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the aggression by Iraq , one of the Middle East 's most anti-American countries . The militants who have been holding the 50 American hostages since Nov. 4 renewed their frenzy and vowed to kill them all if the U.S. took any military action against Iran or Iraq launches a major invasion . <P> The country erupted in exultation when the expelled diplomats arrived at the Tehran airport . <P> " Death to America ! " shouted thousands of Iranians as they surrounded the weary but exhilarated diplomats and pelted them with flowers . All over Iran , millions of people marched in a display of national solidarity to protest what President Abolhassan Banisadr called the " conspiracies of the U.S. and Iraq 's fascist government . " At Tehran University , a crowd roared its approval of anti-American resolutions while chanting " God is great ! " - raising fresh fears for the hostages trapped in the middle of the tumult . In Washington , where supporters of the hostages held candlelight vigils near the Iranian embassy , dozens of Iranian students demonstrated in front of the White House and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran , where sometimes nobody seems to be in charge , and sometimes everybody , worsened Jimmy Carter 's problem . Talleyrand , the 19th century French diplomat , cautioned against " too much zeal . " But how to deal with a nation of zealots , who do not play by the rules of law , who do not or can not keep their promises , who seem more inclined to martyrdom than to statecraft ? <P> For months , the President had pursued a labyrinthine diplomacy that finally led nowhere . He had been given some indication that the students would hand over the hostages to the Iranian government-a minimal first step toward their eventual release . But just when the militants seemed about to go along , Khomeini abruptly refused to take control of the captives and put the matter in the hands of the Iranian National Assembly , which is still to be elected and is not due to meet until late May or early June . Carter cut short his Easter weekend at Camp David and returned by helicopter to the White House . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes . "
