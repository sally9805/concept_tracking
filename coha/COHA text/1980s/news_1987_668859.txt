Citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision , a federal judge in Chicago Friday threw out the mail-fraud and racketeering convictions of a former Cook County Circuit Court judge and three lawyers found guilty in the Operation Greylord investigation of court corruption . U.S. District Judge James Holderman said he reversed the guilty verdicts because of a ruling on June 24 by the Supreme Court that limited the use of the mail-fraud law in criminal cases . The ruling , though , does not clear the four of all the charges against them . Holderman ordered new trials on racketeering charges for the four : former Circuit Judge James L. Oakey and lawyers Harlan Becker , Harry Jaffe and Robert Daniels . Holderman let stand the convictions of Oakey , Becker and Daniels on federal income-tax charges . Becker already is serving a six-year prison term for tax fraud , which Holderman let stand . He said he was prepared to consider sentencing Oakey and Daniels for the tax offenses Aug. 28 . U.S. Atty . Anton Valukas said prosecutors would not appeal Holderman ' s dismissal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges . Holderman said he ordered new trials for racketeering because these charges had included the mail-fraud counts . He said it was impossible to know whether the juries that convicted the four of the racketeering charges had been influenced by these mail-fraud counts . " The mail-fraud counts in these cases were not valid breaches of the mail-fraud statute , " Holderman said . He based his ruling on a Supreme Court decision , handed down earlier this summer , that said prosecutors can not use the mail-fraud law to prosecute defendants in cases where victims were deprived not of real property but of " intangible rights . " In the Greylord cases , federal prosecutors charged that defendants had used the mails to further schemes to deprive citizens of their " intangible right " to an honest court system . Oakey , removed from the bench in 1975 as a result of misconduct charges unrelated to Greylord , was found guilty by a jury May 15 . Testimony at his trial indicated that he took payoffs as a judge , that he paid them to another judge as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four years . The charges against Oakey included mail-fraud , racketeering and tax-law violations . He was to be sentenced by Holderman July 7 , but sentencing was postponed because of the Supreme Court ' s ruling . Becker , Jaffe and Daniels were found guilty by a jury Feb. 17 of paying bribes to deputy bailiffs and court clerks in return for being allowed to solicit clients outside courtrooms , an unethical practice known as " hustling . " Jaffe , 73 , was sentenced by Holderman to a year and a day in prison on racketeering and mail-fraud charges but had not begun serving the sentence . Holderman ' s ruling dismissing the mail-fraud charge and ordering a new trial on the racketeering charges means the year-and-a-day sentence is void . " I expected such a ruling from the judge , " Valukas said . He said that the vast majority of Greylord convictions would be upheld despite the Supreme Court ' s decision . He said convictions in only two cases were endangered . John Ward and Jay Messinger , both lawyers , were convicted solely of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory . Illustration PHOTO <>
