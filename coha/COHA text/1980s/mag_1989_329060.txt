Urban thinker William H. Whyte has read endless obituaries of the American city . He has heard it called everything from " an ecological smear " to a " behavioral sink . " The future , he has been told , is elsewhere : in the suburbs , the country , anywhere but the city . Nonsense , says Whyte . " The core of the city has held . It has not gone to hell . " What is more , he argues , " the city remains a magnificent place to do business , and that is part of the rediscovery of the center . While we are losing a lot of functions that we used to enjoy , we are intensifying the most important function of all  --  a place for coming together . " <P> " Holly " Whyte , an irrepressible 71 , has been lobbing potshots at purveyors of conventional wisdom about cities for more than 20 years . He started making waves in 1956 with his bestseller The Organization Man , one of the first exposes of the emptiness of corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first domestic expedition grant to pursue his urban sleuthing . <P> In his latest book , City , Whyte continues to challenge orthodox urban planning . For one thing , he likes free-floating city congestion . He maintains that gentrification gets a bum rap and that the corporate exodus to the suburbs is stupid . He advocates narrower streets for cars and wider sidewalks for people . Forget exits , he says , it 's time to make better doors . The revolving ones at the bottom of most office towers may save energy , but they are hopelessly inefficient at moving people . Cram as many stores as possible along the streets to bring them alive . Do away with skywalks , abolish sunken plazas and tear down walls in front of parks and playgrounds , because they all increase isolation from the city experience . <P> Whyte puts his faith in something he calls " the impulse of the center , " which animates his vision of the teeming urban core . " You see it at cocktail parties , " he says , " the phenomenon where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in a position of maximum choice . " <P> On the other hand , Whyte contends , the heralded corporate exodus to the suburbs has produced minimal choice . " The new suburban headquarters , " he declares , " say , ' By God , if those bastards from New York come and try to storm our ramparts , we 'll pour boiling water on them . ' " He claims these suburban offices are such lonely places that consultants have to be imported as visitors . " One guy said , ' You 've missed an important point . It is true no one comes out to see us . But when we go into town , we 're much more careful , and we schedule ourselves much more efficiently than otherwise would be the case . ' He proceeded to sketch out a formula for cutting yourself off from any unplanned encounter . " And the unplanned encounter , Whyte concludes , is one of the joys of urban life : " You hear the point you did n't expect to hear . " <P> Whyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburban corporate shift . He tracked 38 companies that left New York City over a ten- year period and discovered that 31 of them had relocated to within eight miles of the home of their chief executive officer . " I take that at face value , " he says deadpan.
