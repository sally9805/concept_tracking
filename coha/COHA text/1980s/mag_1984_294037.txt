New subways and light-rail systems whoosh off drawing boards <P> Near dawn one nippy day last November , several dozen sleepy citizens of Baltimore gathered at the new Reisterstown Plaza station just northwest of downtown . After seven years of jackhammered streets and more than a quarter-century of discussion and planning , they were eager to board the city 's gleaming new subway for its first passenger run . Just past 5 a.m. , the shiny silver-and-blue Metro cars , built at a cost of $600,000 each , whooshed into view . Marveled Mark Miller , a radio announcer who had risen at 3:30 to catch the inaugural trip : " It was a dream come true . " <P> Mass transit is on the move . Baltimore 's sparkling Metro is just the most recent result of a boom in urban rail-system construction . " There is more development going on now than in the past 100 years , " exults Jack Gilstrap , executive vice president of the American Public Transit Association ( A.P.T.A. ) . Since 1972 , when San Francisco cut the ribbon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , six other U.S. cities have opened new rail systems . Six cities currently have lines under construction . Thirteen other systems either have been proposed or are on the drawing boards . <P> Part of the allure of these new networks is , simply , prestige . " I call it the Hyatt Regency mentality , " says David Prosperi , assistant professor of planning at the University of Cincinnati . " Many cities think they have to have a rail system to be a first-class city . " Underneath the arriviste attitude , however , lies a persistent conviction , not always well placed , that mass transit can reduce congestion in traffic-choked downtowns , spark commercial growth and control pollution . Says A.P.T.A. 'S Gilstrap : " When businesses decide where to locate , they look for a city that works well . Good mass transit is both evidence and a symbol of that . " <P> Much of the present flurry has its origins in the 1973 Arab oil embargo , which persuaded many motorists to flee long gas lines for less frustrating subways and buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide up to 50% of transit systems ' operating costs . Until then , money had been available only for capital and planning assistance . One result of this increased federal largesse was an investment spree in capital-intensive projects such as subways and electrified rail . There were some less benign results : fares well under the actual cost of service , leading inevitably to big operating deficits , and growing dependence on Washington for mass-transit support . In 1975 , the first fiscal year in which operating subsidies were available , capital grants totaled $1.28 billion and operating grants totaled $142.5 million . By 1981 those figures had ballooned to $2.94 billion and $1.13 billion respectively . " From a local standpoint , federal mass-transit aid is cheap , " says Gerald Miller , acting director of the transportation program at the Urban Institute , a Washington , D.C.-based think tank . " You can put up a couple of hundred million dollars and get billions back . "
