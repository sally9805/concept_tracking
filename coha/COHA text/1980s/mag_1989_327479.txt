Rumpled and lumbering , with a line of patter as weary as his smile , agent Rupert Anderson looks miscast as a male Mata Hari . Yet here he stands in Mrs. Pell 's hallway , romancing the sad beautician in hopes of securing testimony against her husband . It seems a cruel bit of FBI sleuthing  --  until Anderson steals a glance at her hair . The glance passes as quick as guilt and as long as longing . From it we learn that Anderson knows more about women than we thought , and feels more for this woman than he should . <P> This privileged moment from Mississippi Burning comes courtesy of Gene Hackman , the movies ' modern Spencer Tracy . " Gene is a colossally subtle actor , " says director Alan Parker . " He knows what not to do . Like Tracy , he does n't talk about what he does ; he just does it . " Hackman , 57 , has America 's face , a body that has absorbed its share of life 's shocks , a heart that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can play the stern father or the doting uncle , a bad cop or a top sergeant , your best friend or the man you would n't wish on your worst enemy . As agent Anderson , Hackman plays what he is : the average Joe 's best image of himself . <P> Hackman thinks of himself as a craftsman in an honored , perhaps vanishing tradition . " All of us , " he says , " from ditchdiggers to bus drivers to shoe salesmen , have a need to create something . I 'm blessed that I found a profession that lets me do so . Once in a while , a piece of artistry flows by me or through me , but it 's a mistake to think of myself as ' artistic . ' It looks relaxed , easy , but I work very hard . " <P> No lie there : he must spend more time acting than Michael Caine put together . This fall , five Hackman films were released . " I 'll take what 's offered me , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going for the home run every time . " Sometimes Hackman has hit bunt singles in a movie resume as long as a Chicago Cubs season . Yet he projects such solid authority that not even junk can embarrass him . " I actually think I 've been lucky , " says the star who ca n't say no . " Working constantly not only keeps me sharp , but relieves me of the responsibility of having to perform up to a certain level if I had been waiting for the ' right ' role . " <P> Hackman learned a lot , the hard way , before he ever stepped in front of the camera . His father , a newspaper pressman in Danville , Ill. , beat young Gene . " Though he left town when I was 13 , " Hackman recalls , " he 'd drift back periodically to disrupt things . I was so shy that I never dated in high school . Sexual frustration , plus my unwillingness to live up to my mother 's expectations or to be a father to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of town and join the Marines . " His lone consolations were a doting grandmother  --  " a great gal , a storyteller , a sanctuary "  --  and the movies . " When I 'd walk out of the theater , I knew I was really Errol Flynn or James Cagney . And kids from disturbed environments visualize what they feel is the perfect life . Through acting they can realize their fantasies , recover their lost dreams . "
