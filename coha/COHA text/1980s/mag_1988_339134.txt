The tapes that prompted Richard Nixon 's Watergate resignation in 1974 might never have existed had he not been such a klutz with gadgets . Nixon was reluctant to have his conversations recorded , writes former Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman in Prologue , a National Archives publication . But if there had to be a taping system , the President said , he wanted something simple  --  like Lyndon Johnson 's manually operated setup . <P> Haldeman was worried that his chief would forget to turn the gizmo on when he wanted it , or  --  worse  --  to turn it off when he did n't . Haldeman also fretted " that this President was far too inept with machinery ever to make a success of a switch system . " The result : voice-activated tape recorders were installed in the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room , and at Camp David . Writes Haldeman : " I think Nixon lost his awareness of the system even more quickly than I did . " The machines , of course , forgot nothing .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
