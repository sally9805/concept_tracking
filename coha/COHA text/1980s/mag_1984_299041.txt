The Democrats will send two basic kinds of delegates to their convention this year . The first are those elected in primaries and caucuses . Most are pledged to a particular candidate , while some are elected as uncommitted . Those who are either pledged or have expressed a preference are listed in their candidate 's totals . Under the 1984 rules , however , even pledged delegates are not forced to vote for their candidates . The second type consists of 568 slots set aside for party officials and local and national officeholders . These " superdelegates " are technically unpledged . But those who have made their preferences known are listed in the totals for the candidate they support .
