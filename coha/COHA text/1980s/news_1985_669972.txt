If the " Star Wars " trilogy helped make the old-fashioned western movie obsolete by taking the genre into space , Lawrence Kasdan can take partial credit . He co-authored the scripts for " The Empire Strikes Back " and " Return of the Jedi . " Now , if boots and spurs and wagon trains and colorful saloons and stampeding cattle  --  in other words , the whole horsy works  --  come back into vogue , Mr. Kasdan will be able to take partial credit for that , too . He is director and co-writer of " Silverado , " a panoramic , noisy , romping movie that cheerily embraces western conventions , right down to its vibrant , Coplandesque musical score by Bruce Broughton . Yet " Silverado " doesn ' t seem like warmed-over Howard Hawks . Mr. Kasdan has a nicely skeptical eye with which he manages to wink at broadly heroic western-style hokum even as he ' s paying tribute to it . ( The rest of the credit for a western revival , if it happens , must go to Clint Eastwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a hit . ) Mr. Kasdan seems an unlikely director to reinvent the western . His two previous directing efforts were small scale and hiply ironic ( " Body Heat , " a steamy sendup of " film noir " and " The Big Chill , " a slick variation on the **44;304;TOOLONG genre ) . That , said the 36-year-old director , was exactly the point . " ' Silverado ' was so radically different from what I ' d done . I wanted to make a big picture with a lot of problems . " And , in some ways , he wanted to recreate his own youth for his two children . When he was growing up in West Virginia , he said , " Westerns set the standards of heroism , bravery and courage . " But haven ' t the " Star Wars " movies taken over the moral code embodied by stark battles between black hats and white ones ? " To me , they aren ' t a good replacement , " said Mr. Kasdan . When he shopped " Silverado " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful western hadn ' t rolled out of Hollywood in years , and one of the last attempts  --  Michael Cimino ' s " Heaven ' s Gate "  --  destroyed a studio . The fact that Mr. Kasdan ' s executive producers , Charles Okun and Michael Grillo , had worked on " Heaven ' s Gate " didn ' t help . Neither did his projected cast , which included many top-drawer actors but no major stars , like Mr. Eastwood , say . What helped were the box-office returns from " The Big Chill . " They were hefty enough to encourage Columbia Pictures to give Mr. Kasdan a shot at his western , after he agreed to defer his salary and to cut the picture ' s budget to $21 million from $25 million . ( During filming in Nevada , bad weather slowed production , so the movie cost more than the originally projected $25 million anyway . ) " Silverado " looks great and moves fast . Mr. Kasdan has packed his action well against the fearsomely long , dusty stretches of Western plain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( maybe the one in " The French Connection " ) that can stir up the juices like the sight of men galloping after each other on horseback . Screeching tires simply don ' t make the primal connection tapped by thundering hoofs . In other words , sweat-slathered stallions at full tilt make you want to shout " Yahoo ! " but the fastest-cornering Ferraris don ' t . The story Mr. Kasdan tells , with more than a little help from his equine friends , is about four men who end up riding together toward the desert boom town of Silverado . Once there , they face off against an evil cattle baron and his sly lackey , who is the local sheriff and saloonkeeper ( an archetypal heavy played with spooky , grinning menace by Brian Dennehy ) . On the road to the movie ' s main event , the four horsemen of Silverado ' s inevitable apocalypse fight various preliminary battles . But Mr. Kasdan ' s quartet is more than the " Magnificent Seven " minus three . Mr. Kasdan ' s heroes aren ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of twist to almost every stock character . Paden ( Kevin Kline ) , the drifter with a past , displays uncowboylike flashes of irony and ambivalence . We meet him when one of his future henchmen stumbles across him in the desert , sprawled on the ground , clad only in faded long johns . Revived by water , this corpselike , dust-caked figure out there in the middle of worse than nowhere grins at his savior . " Pleased to meet you , " he says . Yet just when Paden seems to be snickering a tad too much , Mr. Kasdan puts him into a situation that requires him to stand tall , draw fast and shoot straight . And he does . Scott Glenn and Danny Glover play characters who most closely resemble conventional cowboy heroes , except for the fact that Mr. Glover is black . Kevin Costner , whose part was cut from " The Big Chill , " displays a wigged-out comic talent as the fourth cowboy , a giddy kid who twirls six-shooters like batons and almost hangs for kissing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild-and-crazy West with even odder characters . John Cleese , the British comedian best known for his absurdist " Monty Python " roles , does a very funny turn as a frontier sheriff . There is the requisite wise-lady saloonkeeper , but instead of a faded beauty she is a dwarf , the fine actress , Linda Hunt . The action flags only during the cowboys ' brief fling at romance with a pretty settler called Hannah , played by the lovely Rosanna Arquette . Most of the 37 minutes Mr. Kasdan cut from the movie came out of Ms. Arquette ' s hide , leaving only brief , mysterious flashes of her making oblique speeches that seem out of context because they are . However unhappy this may be for Ms. Arquette , for the rest of us it is merely a small stain on an otherwise spotless frolic.
