In this 50th anniversary year for the Royal Ballet , the first mixed bill , in effect , stressed this creative side . Not only Sir Frederick Ashton , the dominant influence , but also two other choreographers who played an important role in the company ' s history , were represented on a single program . The Ashton contribution was reflected in his new " Rhapsody " and his 1976 " A Month in the Country . " Kenneth MacMillan , now principal choreographer , was represented by his new " La Fin du jour . " The World War II period was embodied in Sir Robert Helpmann ' s 1942 " Hamlet , " revived excellently for the golden jubilee year. // " Rhapsody , " set to Rachmaninoff ' s " Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini , " calls up words such as exultation , jubilation and celebration . It was indeed created in honor of the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. // But it was also choreographed in the summer of 1980 , for Mikhail Baryshnikov as the male lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between this sole Ashton ballet for Mr. Baryshnikov and the ballets Sir Frederick first created for Rudolf Nureyev . Those were set to Scriabin ( " Poeme Tragique , " 1961 ) and Liszt ( " Marguerite and Armand , " 1963 ) . The cape swirling in each was Sir Frederick ' s brilliant way of defining , at the start , the image Rudolf Nureyev would actually project throughout his career in the West . Mr. Nureyev ' s Romantic presence was exploited to the full , in the best sense , in these ballets. // In the same way , " Rhapsody " singles out Mr. Baryshnikov ' s most dominant side - the virtuosity that makes him possibly classical ballet ' s most perfect technician . This is not to say that Mr. Nureyev ' s own fabulous technique was not concomitant with his charismatic stage presence . Nor that Mr. Baryshnikov ' s artistry reduces him to a mere technician . It is merely that Frederick Ashton has accentuated the essence of each dancer with the truths few dare to utter. // The theme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images embedded in the choreography of " Rhapsody . " The virtuoso violinist and composer , Paganini , is Rachmaninoff ' s own inspiration in a score that itself requires strong technique and emits a straightforward percussiveness , contrasting with the kind of lyricism associated with so many other Ashton ballets ( and the florid scores used in the Nureyev ballets ) . At one point in " Rhapsody , " the male lead - danced here by Anthony Dowell or Stephen Beagley - mimes the playing of a violin . When the ballerina , Lesley Collier , enters midway , the hero seems to harken . The music suddenly wafts in as she stands in the rear . He seems to sense her presence without seeing her. // She is , it would be nice to presume , his muse . " Rhapsody " is one of the Ashton mystery ballets . We are free to construct a scenario for a ballet that has no scenario. // Sir Frederick once wrote : " I think that ballets , without librettos , popularly known as abstract ballets , though appearing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a basic idea which is not necessarily apparent to the public , or a personal fount of emotion from which the choreography springs . Otherwise , in my opinion , a cold complexity emerges which ceases to move an audience. " // " Rhapsody " is plotless . Yet it does have a larger subject suggested by its tone and even Sir Frederick ' s own set design . This is a neo-Palladian colonnade and arch . The six-couple ensemble is first seen in silhouette leaning over the balustrade . The decor , with its platform steps , suggests a theatrical set more than a real neoclassic facade. // In the same way , the male principal and male ensemble as dressed by William Chappell - in gold hairnet caps and gilded jackets - are not really Greek or Roman ( they do get gladiator music at one point ) but modern abstractions of neo-classical figures . These references to theatrical elements and to proportion make " Rhapsody " a paean to art , harmonious in a classical ideal but fired with the virtuosity of great artists. // Some have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages , of the Ashton " Monotones . " The earlier " Symphonic Variations " could also be a distant ancestor . Yet somehow this is an Ashton ballet that looks unlike any other . It is a celebration and piece d ' occasion but it is not like the 1956 " Birthday Offering " or the 1953 " Homage to the Queen . " It is less ceremonial , less conscious of allusions to past phases in ballet and theater . It has a typical Ashton pas de deux in the center to the well-known 18th variation of the score . But the duet ' s lyricism and low-level lifts are more flamboyant , more rapturous , than pastoral , // The idiom is typical Ashton neo-classicism but the technique is overtly demanding . The ensemble participates as actively as the principals . Miss Collier ' s feet seem to trill in the outstanding performance of the small swift steps that marks her solos . The virtuosity for the man was obviously built on Mr. Baryshnikov ' s special qualities , flamboyant leaps into the air with legs shooting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dowell nor Mr. Bagley looked quite right in the part . But Mr. Dowell ' s perfect line made him a cross between Apollo and Mercury , with an artistocratic air to the bows that open the ballet and run through it . Mr. Beagley had a welcome power that revealed more of the choreography . He was particularly sensitive at the moment in which he conveyed his awareness of Miss Collier ' s presence. // There is , strangely , a quasi-romantic passage when the hero approaches each girl until he finds his ideal - Miss Collier - on the steps of the colonnade . Still , " Rhapsody " is not romantic . It glorifies the individualism of the virtuoso artist . But it keeps the romantic ego in check by framing it in the balanced proportions of the neo-classic ensemble. // At first glance , " Rhapsody " is so exhilarating , it is disconcerting . The men , sometimes in pairs , pick up the bravura of the hero , who streaks across the stage . There seems a disparity between the ensemble and the meteor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphs . Wisely , he has also created the firmament within which these fireworks need to exist. // Mr. MacMillan ' s " La Fin du jour " is perhaps his finest ballet . It relies on symbolism but is oblique in conveying the favorite MacMillan theme of young lives altered by trauma . His conceit here is the use of style itself to convey content . An era on the eve of World War II is suggested through 1930 ' s fashion magazine poses , reflecting a leisured class about to lose its leisure . The advent of war is implied when the men in sporting attire sight invisible planes . But they also freeze in a golf swing or a tennis serve. // Ravel ' s Piano Concerto in G Major offers the right jazz-age echo for the opening beach party and the closing evening-dress affair , with the men in pink , blue , yellow tails bouncing from pushup positions . The middle movement is an ingenious porteur sequence - two women wearing bathing suits and goggles are manipulated in the air by five men . The women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some inventive movement . The way a variety of poses in Art Deco style are embedded in the choreography is one of its most successful aspects. // When the first woman finally closes a door that looks out on a naif fern-filled landscape , it is , yes , the end of the day and there is no exit . The outdoor sporting scene becomes boxed indoors : a post-Existentialist statement restated with originality. //
