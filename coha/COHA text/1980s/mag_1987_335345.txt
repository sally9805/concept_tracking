If nothing else , the 2-in. by 4 1/2-in. advertisement on page 6 of the May 24 Sunday New York Times was intriguing : FOR THE DISCERNING BUYER : SUBMARINE FOR SALE . Offered was a " fully equipped " but " de-armed " submarine capable of carrying 70 passengers and crew , with a cruising range of up to 9,000 miles . Prospective purchasers were invited to mail their inquiries to Box F7266 , care of the Times . <P> Was the ad a hoax ? A spokesman for the Times said absolutely not . Since there are so few fully operational subs in existence , many maritime brokers felt sure they would know of the vessel if it were genuine . Argued a spokesman for H. Clarkson , the London ship brokers : " It 's absolute nonsense . " The U.S. Navy tried unsuccessfully to locate the sub 's owner . By week 's end the owner of the mystery vessel  --  was it Captain Nemo ?  --  had not yet surfaced.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
