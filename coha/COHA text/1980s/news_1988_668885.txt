Chicago-area and Northwest Indiana coaches will nominate players for the game . Proceeds will go to Chicago Tribune Charities and the Ronald McDonald Children ' s Charities. - Nike is trying to arrange a slam-dunk competition among Chicago high school players and has received an okay from the Illinois High School Association. - It ' s still early in the game , but De Paul is one of 10 teams in the running for Jimmy Jackson , the 6-6 , 225-pound guard from Macomber-Whitney High School in Toledo . Jackson and 6-1 guard Kenny Anderson of Queens ( N.Y. ) Archbishop Molloy are generally regarded as the top two juniors in the country . Jackson is averaging 28 points , 9 rebounds , 6. 5 assists and 3 steals . He has narrowed his list of college possibilities to Iowa , Purdue , Ohio State , Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Georgetown and North Carolina and is expected to decide this summer which five he will visit . Jackson is playing both guard positions and forward this season , but Macomber-Whitney coach Bart Schroeder believes that he will play the point in college . " He ' s a total player and has superb peripheral vision , " Schroeder said . " He sees the floor as though he was born on it . For a big man , his ballhandling is superb. " - " If they watched me , they saw nothing , " said 6-5 Jacksonville senior Andy Kaufmann , who scored 30 points in an 83-79 loss Saturday at Thornton . Kaufmann was off all night , missing 17 of 26 shots from the field , including his last five of the game . " They saw some poor outside shooting from me , " said Kaufmann , who led the state in scoring the last two years but trails David Olson of Newark 35. 7 points a game to 33 this season . " I kept changing the arc on my shots , but I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it was , but I was out of synch all night . " Not only did Kaufmann ' s team lose for only the second time this season , but he was also outscored by unheralded Thornton sophomore Maurice Stovall , who had a career-high 35 points . Stovall made 13 of 17 from the field , including four of seven three-pointers. - Thornton ' s victory took some of the sting out of Friday ' s 66-61 SICA East loss to Thornridge , a game in which Thornridge ' s off-again , on-again sophomore guard Townsend Orr scored 31 points. - Junior forward Juvon McGarry has received most of the praise in Evanston ' s season so far , but the rest of the team has done its job , too . " Everyone ' s finding roles , " Wildkit coach Mike Hart said . " Tyrone Bell has become our assist leader , and our other guards , Kyle Benoit and Pat Farragher , realize that they ' re going to be the guys that have to do the dirty work for us . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Derek Murray has given us a spark off the bench . " Evanston ( 19-3 ) won its 11th straight game Saturday , beating St. Rita 46-43 at the Horizon . It clinched the Central Suburban League South title Friday with a 61-56 victory over Glenbrook South. - Proviso East coach Bill Hitt , whose team lost to Argo 64-62 in the second game of the Horizon double-header , believes the Pirates are starting to live up to their lofty preseason billing . Proviso ( 12-8 ) got off to a slow start but has lost only three games since Christmas . " I ' d rather be good all year , " Hitt said . " But if you ' re going to be good only at the beginning or at the end , I ' d rather be good at the end . I think we ' re ready ( for the state tournament ) . I think we ' ve realized that we have to work as a group and that we have to believe that we ' re capable of beating the good teams . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - Top games on this week ' s schedule include Thornton at Homewood- Flossmoor Tuesday , Argo at St. Rita Tuesday , South Shore at Simeon Thursday , Naperville Central at Naperville North Friday , Zion-Benton at Warren Friday , Round Lake at Grant Friday , St. Charles at East Aurora Friday , Lake Forest at Warren Saturday and Evanston at East Aurora Saturday. - Teams that have clinched league championships : Huntley ( Big Eight ) , Evanston ( Central Suburban South ) , St. Benedict ( Chicago Prep ) , Crystal Lake South ( Fox Valley ) , Sandwich ( Interstate Eight ) , Fremd ( Mid-Suburban North ) , Hoffman Estates ( Mid-Suburban South ) , Lisle ( Northeast ) , Walther Lutheran ( Private School League ) , Argo ( SICA North ) and Proviso West ( West Suburban Silver ) . . . . Teams that have gained at least a tie for a league title are : St. Joseph ( East Suburban Catholic ) , University High ( Independent School League ) , Herscher ( Kankakee Valley ) , Thornton Fractional North ( SICA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - It has been 13 years since any team but Benet Academy has won the West Suburban Catholic Conference championship , but St. Edward needs only a victory over Wheaton St. Francis on Tuesday to annex the title . The Green Wave is 9-4 in conference competition , one game in front of Benet , Driscoll and Providence . It won ' t be easy , however . In its first meeting with St. Francis , St. Edward won 64-63 . " I ' ve had better teams in past years , " says St. Edward coach Joe Tullo , but Benet was always there in front of us. " - The Little Seven Conference has decided to table a plan which would increase its membership from 8 to 12 schools and divide it into two divisions , based on enrollment . Not enough big schools wanted to join , and there wasn ' t enough time. - Quigley North beat Ridgewood 56-53 , which beat Taft 51-49 , which beat Fenwick 48-47 , which beat De La Salle 61-55 , which beat St. Joseph 60-56 . That makes Quigley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " than St. Joseph ( 20-2 ) . GIRLS ' BASKETBALL No major upsets took place last week in the Class A and AA regionals . Perhaps the only real surprise was Evanston ' s 61-32 rout of host Regina Dominican , a highly ranked team for much of the season , in Friday ' s title game . The Wildkits ( 19-7 ) now have the advantage of hosting their own sectional , although the winner of the New Trier-Niles West semifinal matchup will still be the favorite . Evanston faces Madonna Tuesday in its semifinal game. - As expected , Girls Catholic Athletic Conference foes Mother McAuley and Maria meet Monday night in the first round of the Shepard Class AA sectional . The teams split in conference play . In perhaps the toughest sectional in the state , featuring four of The Tribune ' s top 15 teams , Lourdes and once-beaten Sandburg will meet in the other semifinal. - Thursday ' s round of the Public League playoffs proved there is still a large gap between the few top teams and the rest of the playoff qualifiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47 points . Young ' s 120-20 victory over Roosevelt was the biggest rout . Senn ' s 60-39 win over Crane was the closest encounter . Top-ranked Marshall coasted to an 80-point victory over Orr . WRESTLING The state dual-meet tournament this week could be the most balanced since the format began in 1984 . Each first-round match should be close , with defending champion Marist meeting unbeaten Providence , De Kalb facing Cahokia , Lane Tech meeting Glenbard North and Oak Park going against Palatine . The upper bracket , with Marist and Providence , looks to be the stronger of the two . The final could be the easiest match of the tournament for the survivor of the upper bracket . In the lower bracket , no team stands out above the rest . Providence has a good shot at giving coach Tim Ruettiger a Class AA title to go with the Class A crown his Celtics won in 1979 . What could hurt Providence is that eight of its wrestlers will also be competing in the state individual competition . The Celtics will be doing a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has six individual qualifiers . Glenbard North should be fresh with only three individual qualifiers. - The 185-pound class at the Sandburg sectional was the toughest class in memory . The top six wrestlers combined for a 181-10 record going into Friday ' s first round . It reminded some observers of the sectional a few years ago that produced NCAA champion Kirk Trost , then of Lincoln-Way , and national Greco- Roman champion Derrick Waldroup , then of Bremen . Some very good wrestlers were going to stay home , and Stagg ' s Steve Hughes , second last year in the state meet , was the first victim . He lost 6-3 to Mt . Carmel ' s Mike Manganiello on Friday . Manganiello lost to Marist ' s Tom Salvino in the semifinals , eliminating Hughes , who finished the season with a 32-1 record . " It made it all that much tougher , " said Salvino , who suffered his first loss of the season 3-0 to Oak Lawn ' s Sherif Zegar in the finals . " It was more than a challenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It just shows you that you can ' t let down for one match . " Zegar is 27-1 , his only loss coming to Naperville North heavyweight Jim Hannon in the finals of the Hinsdale Central tournament . Salvino is 33-1. - Andrew ' s Joe Gilbert will be shooting for a third straight Class AA championship this weekend . Gilbert ( 35-0 ) refuses to let the pressure get to him . " Everyone is trying to build up a match between me and Sean Bourmet ( of Providence ) , " he said . " I ' m just trying to worry about my next match . I don ' t pay any attention to what is going on but my next match . I want a third title real bad ; I ' ve wanted it all year . I ' ve got something to prove . You ' ve got to keep proving yourself to everybody when you ' re a state champion . When I was a freshman , I had to prove myself , and I had to do it again when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Gilbert and Bormet ( 37-0 ) could meet in the 132-pound finals. - Johnsburg ' s Mike Lewis ended the season with an undefeated record but no state title because of a wrist injury . Lewis , 31-0 at 105 , was unable to compete at the Barrington sectional. - Thornton heavyweight Larry Love isn ' t very heavy . Love , sixth in the state meet last season , is a 206-pounder . Most of the top heavyweights are in the 250-pound range . " I ' m used to wrestling big guys , " he said . " Now I use my quickness instead of strength . If I use strength , it ' s in the last period when I have worn him down . " Love has considerable strength , having a bench press of 400 pounds . He signed a football letter of intent to Montana State as a linebacker . " Football was my main thing , and that ' s how I got to wrestling , " he said . " I didn ' t think I ' d be this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have gotten a wrestling scholarship instead , I would have taken it. " - Reavis ' Robert Lockner qualified for the state meet as something of an unknown . Lockner , 11-1 at 132 , moved with his father into the Reavis district from Shawnee , Okla . Lockner was a state qualifier in Oklahoma but was ineligible during the first semester because of a transcript problem . " We ' re very fortunate to have him , " said Reavis coach Don Schultz . " He ' s an excellent wrestler. " - Maine East ' s unbeaten Matt Bernstein , who won the 167 title at the Fenton sectional , is a takedown artist , and it ' s no surprise that former Demon state champion Emiliano Hernandez is one of his workout partners . Bernstein has more than 130 takedowns this season and is 33-0 . " We work on takedowns all day long , " said Bernstein , an A student in the classroom and the wrestling room . " Coach Hernandez works with me and is a great guy . He tells me what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all takedowns . I wrestle different people different ways. " - Hoffman Estates 185-pound Bob Gwiasda was thrilled just to be in the Fenton finals after what happened last year . He came into the sectional then as a junior with a 33-0 record and ended his season with two straight losses . This year , he was 29-0 coming in and 32-0 going out . " There was even more pressure on me after last year , " he said after a 9-3 victory over Fenton ' s Chris Ziegler . " I just wanted to get out ( qualify for state ) this year. " - Elgin ' s Jeff Mirabella has a list , although not a very long one , of opponents he needs to pay back . " I keep a list of people who have beaten me , and I have to pay them back , " he said after winning the Fenton sectional . " I wrestled one guy at the Northern Illinois freestyle tournament and I was so psyched . I wanted to totally punish him so he would never want to wrestle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mirabella is 33-1 at 98 and his only loss was to East Aurora ' s Darrin Thompson at 112. - Unbeaten and untied wrestlers : Brad Stockstill , Mt .
