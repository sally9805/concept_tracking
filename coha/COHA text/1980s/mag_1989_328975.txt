It was a spectacular souffle of politics , parades and visual extravaganzas  --  all steeped in historical symbolism , spiced with controversy and served up to the world with characteristic elan . France threw itself a revolutionary birthday party last week , and the world joined in the celebration , as President Francois Mitterrand recalled the glory of 1789 as the " birth of the modern era . " <P> The festivities began with a tribute to the Declaration of the Rights of Man , attended by President George Bush and 33 other world leaders .

The celebration culminated two days later on July 14 , the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille , as fireworks exploded over the Place de la Concorde , once the site of the dreaded guillotine .

Nor could they dampen the soaring spirit evoked when American diva Jessye Norman , wrapped in the blue , white and red colors of the French flag , sang La Marseillaise . For a few fleeting days the City of Light shone brighter than usual . For a magical moonlit moment  --  but only a moment  --  it seemed possible that the divisions that have sundered France between revolutionaries and royalists , between left and right , between natives and immigrants , would melt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
