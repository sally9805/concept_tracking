Prices have soared , which also alters the perception of value . Promised acoustical improvements were never made , so the closely packed room is noisy . Anyone unfortunate enough to be seated under the stairway may have to fight off feathers drifting down from the cage of the mourning doves above and at the same time cope with the thundering herds of waiters running to and from the kitchen . Members of the dining-room staff , which is sometimes pleasant and efficient , can be thoughtless , chatting among themselves while customers wait unacknowledged . A few occasionally wear dirty aprons , and others are unshaven. // Still , the brief blackboard menu offers some pleasantly simple food , beginning with an hors d ' oeuvres assortment that included first-rate smoked trout , smoked salmon , vegetable salads and salami . The assortment was stale on only one occasion . A cold Senegalese soup , golden with curry , had been pureed with banana , a touch that added only the slightest counterpoint of sweetness plus a creamy texture . Nevertheless , a full portion was overrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier occasions were sparkling and sharp , arrived completely lackluster one recent evening , and a cold cucumber soup at lunch tasted of nothing at all . A sprightly , crisp green salad with raw mushrooms and a pungent vinaigrette dressing was refreshing as a first course , and the asparagus was suitably firm and green. // Poached fish such as halibut and coho salmon had the proper moistness and silky butter sauces , and a rose-pink Choron sauce did justice to pearly grilled swordfish . Grilled fillet of sole at lunch arrived dry and suspiciously fishy in smell and taste , but a young lobster could not have been more carefully steamed . Paillard of beef was well grilled , but veal sauteed with lemon was watery and bland . Vegetables are firm and bright , and cheeses in a large assortment are carefully chosen , with chevres being the most distinguished. // At one lunch raspberry tart was apparently a leftover , judging by its mushy crust , but at dinner another sample had exactly the right butter-cookie crispness . Fresh orange slices in a satiny pastry cream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chocolate mousse was delicious if a little heavy on whipped cream , // House wines , bottled by the Chevillot family in Beaune , seemed to have less bouquet and depth than in the past . Wine as well as food prices have risen , and a three-course lunch for three , with a total of two glasses of white wine and three Perriers , came to $140. // Tempted by the calf ' s liver on the menu , we asked the waiter how it is prepared . Folding his arms across his chest , he uttered a deep sigh of exasperation . " Why it ' s done in the classic way , of course - Veneziana , " he said , explaining the sauteeing , the onions and the white wine that preparation requires . Never mind that he also needed a shave and wore a soiled apron . Just think of the boring customers he must contend with , all asking the same question that the menu should have answered. // This is more or less the way it went at Wise Maria , a four-monthold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South " by Philip Idone , co-owner with his wife , Susan , the chef , and Mary Bagley , who manages the dining room . Mrs. Idone used to own and cook at Sabor , a Cuban restaurant in Greenwich Village , and though she didn ' t have a Cuban background , she did a nice job . The food was not truly Cuban , but it was very good . Now the food is not truly Italian and it is not very good . Cute and pretty applies to the conception of the dishes as much as to the romantically lighted pink-and-gray dining rooms. // Only the front dining room , opposite the bar , is comfortable ( though the booths are too cramped for four ) , and the sound and light are felicitous . But in the back dining room one sits in stiff chairs and always in a traffic pattern. // The food doesn ' t work any better than the setting , with hardly a dish unaffected by cleverness . Mint replaces basil on a soupy creamed fettuccine with peas and prosciutto to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheese sprinkled on it . Although more classic , a small , $8 portion of spaghetti al pesto arrived barely tepid and completely pasty. // What is called calzone is a huge appetizer of good , crisp yeasty pastry , disconcertingly filled with strong Gruyere and Montrachet cheese . Pizza is a pie all right , but the raw tomatoes sliced onto the dough turn it to mush in the baking . Better to saute the tomatoes first to get rid of their water . Littleneck clams touched with herbed butter were hot but not cooked , an unpleasant condition , and sliced tomatoes with smoked mozzarella never caught the perfume of the basil sprinkled on them. // The best appetizers were roasted , marinated peppers with baby eggplants and olives , and firm , bright hot asparagus gilded with butter and sharp grana cheese. // The cook ' s relentless inventiveness affected the main dishes as well . Gorgonzola cheese blended with butter made grilled veal and lamb chops smell and taste spoiled . Unpleasantly fishy swordfish was overzapped with herbs , and an otherwise tender and succulent steamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olive oil . A dry , hard , small steak came as a shock at $18 and softshell crabs , long past their prime , had been fried without batter so that their shells were unpleasantly brittle. // Pleasant surprises were very good calf ' s liver ; a lovely tiny , juicy chicken grilled under a veneer of crushed peppercorns , and tender nuggets of moist chicken sauteed with sliced fresh artichoke hearts . Those dishes , plus a lively arugula salad and superb white , whole wheat and semolina breads , could make up a delicious if overpriced meal . Finish with the light chocolate torte adrift in a sea of vanilla-sauce sea or cold ricotta souffle , much like an airy Italian cheesecake , and you should go away satisfied . Not so if you wind up with the bitter poached pears in a lumpy and cheesy zabaglione sauce or the fig tart , with its near-raw dough . Espresso is served in ridiculous thimble-size cups . Based on the three red wines we tried , the selection is better suited to a pizzeria .
