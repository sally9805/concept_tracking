Well , if bistros and country cooking ( or as Clark Wolf , a restaurant consultant in New York , describes it , " lumpy , homey food " ) are popular in the three trend-setting cities , what is going to be hot in Birmingham , Ala. , next year ? And how does Cleveland compare with Washington on the trend meter ? // Compared with Cleveland , Washington is not a culinary backwater . It has come far enough to be interested in promoting local foods , something that has been happening in California for more than 10 years and in New York for at least 5. // Restaurants like McPherson ' s Grill and the Grill at the Occidental in Washington are cooking regional American food , says Ellen Brown , a food consultant , and they are buying whatever they can from farmers in the area . They are also taking advantage of the superb seafood offered by Chesapeake Bay . " The French hold on the city has finally been broken , " Ms. Brown said. // " Food trends do not start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re lucky we get them before they are ready for Social Security. " // In Cleveland there is not yet a sense of what Midwestern food is all about . At least that is the opinion of Parker Bosley who , as owner and chef of Parker ' s restaurant , is trying to change that . " Most of Cleveland is still very much interested in what is going on elsewhere and trying to imitate it here , " he said . " There is still a lot of California style and Southwestern influence. " // Parker ' s , which has been open less than a year , may be the wave of Cleveland ' s restaurant future . It features food grown in northeastern Ohio . " I ' m trying to bring back the kinds of things that were here but got lost , " Mr. Bosley said. // In Birmingham , regional cooking is also catching on . Frank Stitt of the Highland Bar and Grill is using regional ingredients , " reworking forgotten or misused specialties . " He serves mustard and turnip greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Southerners would consider his greens vastly undercooked. // Mr. Stitt is also following two other trends that began in the big three - informal dining and earthier food . But " Cleveland has not got to casual bistros yet , " Mr. Bosley said. // From Los Angeles to Boston , from Dallas to San Francisco , bistros , brasseries and trattorias are springing up much as cavernous , cacophonous rooms were five years ago. // " Neighborhood dining around the corner , " Mr. Wolf said . " People are looking for the real , the tried and true , the substantive . They don ' t want weird architecture on their walls or on their plates. " // And they want value for their money . " People are not willing to pay really high prices anymore , " said Karen Caplan , president of Frieda ' s Finest in Los Angeles , which sells specialty produce nationwide. // Charlotte Walker , whose food and beverage consulting company , Walker &; Associates , is in San Francisco , said , " People are looking for less fussy food. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' attention nationwide , it is new-wave Italian . ( Of course it ' s not new wave to Italians , who have been eating their regional specialties for centuries . ) The trend toward this style began in New York a couple of years ago , and will be as ubiquitous in the 1990 ' s as French restaurants were in the 50 ' s and 60 ' s . But New York may already have had its fill. // " There is going to be a shakedown in Mediterranean madness , " Mr. Wolf said. // The Italian trend is working its way west , trickling into San Franciso and already important in Los Angeles . One Los Angeles restaurateur , in an effort to cover all the bases , has named his restaurant Il Bistro. // Birmingham , too , is feeling the call . Mr. Stitt has opened Bottega , a restaurant featuring peasant-style food from southern Italy . Is Mr. Stitt on the cutting edge in Birmingham ? " I guess that ' s why I ' m doing it , " he replied // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Paula Lambert , owner of the Mozzarella Company , which makes a variety of cheeses . Ms. Lambert has combined the flavors of the Southwest with Italian-style cheese in both a sheep ' s milk and a goat ' s milk caciotta seasoned with Mexican mint marigold and ancho chilies . And she is layering mascarpone cheese with similar flavors. // " A lot of Italian food is being Southwesternized , " she said . " Pizza with ancho chili cheese , cilantro and grilled shrimp . They put chilis in everything , not necessarily for the fire but for the flavor. " // Can the experts list specific foods that will become trends in the next 12 months ? Mr. Wolf states flatly , " There are no hot new ingredients , unless you include beans. " // A prediction from Frieda ' s Finest is bananas , all varieties . Specialty bananas have been seen in Washington-area supermarkets . But not in Cleveland . Or Birmingham. // Lemongrass is mentioned occasionally , but it is old hat to Californians by now , and it too has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trend spotters in Cleveland , as well as in Hartford , Des Moines and Detroit , can look forward to more organic ingredients in the markets ; to branded produce , not only from large companies like Dole and Del Monte but from smaller packers as well ; to the return of cocktails like sidecars and brandy Alexanders , and supermarkets that offer home delivery of prepared food that is far more elaborate than pizzas or Chinese. // Ms. Caplan predicts that supermarkets will move prepared foods to the front of the store during the day so people can pop in for a quick lunch , and then move them to the back of the store in the evening , when people have more time to shop. // Sous-vide , however , is not the wave of the future , Mr. Wolf said . This method of cooking food and then preserving it in an airtight plastic pouch for later reheating in boiling water is right up there with other failures like irradiated food and the Edsel. // " I don ' t think people are going out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Wolf said. //
