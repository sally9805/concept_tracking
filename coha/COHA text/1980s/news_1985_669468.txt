Stone ' s soda straws , it turns out , are helping scientists study , understand , and develop management techniques for the tiny wild bees that do such a prodigious job of pollinating so many fruit , grass , and vegetable crops . When placed in an appropriately dark environment , these soda straws make ideal nesting sites for the ever-active and vitally important little creatures . Another plus for the small wild bee is that it can not cross-breed with the Africanized honeybee ( the so-called ' ' killer bee ' ' ) . There ' s no hybridizing between wild bees and honeybees. // // Butterflies , moths , flies , even birds and bats , pollinate crops , but no living organism does a better job than bees - and wild bees do the best job of all . Indeed , when it comes to ensuring a good seed crop , even the busy honeybee is a sluggard alongside his wild , non-honeymaking cousin. // Wild bees come in all sizes and shapes , from the large tanklike black bees ( one-third bigger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Southwest to some almost microscopic little fellows . There are more species in the bee family than all animal and bird species put together - 20 , 000 worldwide , to be exact . In North America alone the known and categorized figure stands at 5 , 000 and still counting . According to researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture ' s wild-bee research station at Logan , Utah , we may never know how many species we have . What we now do know is that agriculture would be devastated without them. // For example , when a honeybee visits a sunflower ( actually a composite of between 1 , 000 and 2 , 000 tiny flowers ) , perhaps 15 seeds will result from that one visit . In contrast , a single visit from the big Eumegachile pugnata , or sunflower leaf-cutter bee , will result in 97 new seeds . Put another way , you need six honeybees to do the work of one sunflower leaf-cutter. // The USDA woke up to the need to research wild bees back in the 1930s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over alfalfa took nectar but did nothing in return for the plant . The honeybee , it turns out , is simply too big to get to the pollen . But certain tiny wild bees could crawl right down into the alfalfa flower and do an effective job of pollinating. // The wild-bee research center at Logan was established in the early ' 40s to study wild bees and see if they could be managed in any way. // For years it was thought that because wild bees formed no colonies , but rather lived as loners or else in pairs , they could not readily be managed and moved from field to field as can the hives of honeybees . But studies at Logan and in other areas of the world have shown that wild bees can be easily managed . Establishing ' ' colonies ' ' can be as simple as drilling small nesting holes in blocks of wood , which can then be moved from field to field or orchard to orchard as needed. // The alfalfa leaf-cutter bee ( one of the few beneficial insects to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be managed this way . So can the blue orchard bee , known in Latin as Osmia lignaria. // Portable sheds containing bee-impregnated nesting boards - wild-bee apartment complexes , you might say - are now a feature of many Western alfalfa fields . These sheds are simply placed on trailers and towed to another field as needed . The effect of this wild-bee management system has been to raise alfalfa seed production from between 50 and 100 pounds an acre to between 700 and 800 pounds an acre. // Currently the use of the blue orchard bee , using similar management techniques , is taking off . Entomologist Philip Torchio of the Logan research station has worked with this little bee ( slightly smaller than a honeybee ) for several years . The bee normally breeds in holes left by wood-boring insects in standing dead trees or fallen logs . So Mr. Torchio drilled appropriate-size holes in blocks of wood and pushed paper straws ( the thick-shake variety ) into these holes to create easily inspected nesting sites for the insect. // The bees could have managed very well without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow scientists could readily pull out the straws to examine the nesting bees anytime they wished . What Torchio has been able to find out over the years has turned the blue orchard bee into a commercially viable pollinator. // Because the orchard bees have no store of honey on which to survive , they live a sort of hand-to-mouth existence - which means they work every day , come rain or shine . They work in much lower light levels than the honeybee and at lower temperatures , too . In other words , they make ideal pollinators for spring-flowering apple , pear , and stone-fruit ( peach , plum , nectarine , etc. ) orchards which are in peak bloom during a season that can often be plagued by cloudy and cool weather . Whereas two colonies of honeybees with several thousand to a hive are needed to pollinate an acre of apples properly , about 500 orchard bees will do a thorough pollinating job of the same area. // While urbanization has destroyed wild-bee nesting sites , nothing has been more detrimental to concentrations of wild bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - agriculture . The destruction of woodlands , hedgerows , and natural grasslands by the plow has left good wild-bee real estate very difficult to come by . Hence the need to manage wild bees in the same way honeybees are managed. // Another reason the importance of well-managed wild bees might increase is the advance of the killer bee . Because the Africanized bee hybridizes so readily with conventional honeybees , it is thought that most honeybee colonies will steadily become too aggressive to manage easily . This might prompt many apiarists to give up beekeeping , leaving fewer honeybee colonies for pollinating work . Turning to the little wild bee appears to be a sound option. // **28;45740; Those wishing to establish wild-bee populations in orchards or gardens can write to the Bee Biology Lab , Utah State University , UMC53 , Logan , Utah 84322 for sources of appropriate wild-bee species . <> <> <> Directions for attracting those busy bees // // It ' s fairly simple to attract existing wild bees to your garden or orchard by making appropriate nesting sites. // Many species of wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Torchio , so he recommends drilling holes 3 to 5 inches deep ( 5 inches for the blue orchard bee ) into blocks of wood and suspending them in protected areas like so many bird feeders. // Under the eaves of your house is an ideal place , Mr. Torchio says . Then if there are any wild bees in the area , they will be attracted to the blocks and start nesting there. // Many bees need mud to complete their nest , so see that the soil nearby is kept appropriately moist. // // // //
