Casey survives the furor , but suspicion and intrigue linger <P> " It is the unanimous judgment of the committee that no basis has been found for concluding that Mr. Casey is unfit to serve as director of Central Intelligence . " <P> It was hardly a ringing endorsement , but that statement by a sour Senator Barry Goldwater nevertheless ended a two-week furor in Washington over the fitness of William Joseph Casey , 68 , to stay on as head of the Central Intelligence Agency . The Senate Intelligence Committee , which Goldwater leads , promised to push on with its investigation of Casey , but Ronald Reagan 's former campaign manager clearly had won , on points , one of the nastiest brawls in Washington since the President took office . In a broader sense , however , everyone lost . Casey remained under suspicion . Goldwater and other Senators who attacked Casey prematurely had been forced to retreat . Questions about secret CIA operations , and the character and judgment of the nation 's top spymasters , had been raised around the world . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional motives , the springing of leaks and planting of misinformation , and a web of backstage intrigue that tended to obscure the real reasons for the struggle . As pieced together last week by TIME correspondents , the inside story reflects little glory on any of the participants . <P> A central figure in the drama was the increasingly crusty Goldwater , who considers himself the Senate 's leading expert on intelligence . The venerable ( 72 ) Arizona Republican was miffed when the Reagan transition team failed to consult him last January on who should head the CIA . He did not like the choice of Casey , a wily and tough Washington operator , to direct the agency . Casey made matters worse by virtually ignoring both Goldwater 's committee and the House Intelligence Committee , which take their duties to oversee the CIA seriously . He even curtailed the CIA 's congressional liaison staff . <P> Meanwhile , tension was rising between the White House and the oversight committees on just how much flexibility the CIA should be given to conduct covert operations and plant undercover agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance in order to prevent the kind of excesses that caused the CIA so much public grief in the 1970s . Reagan , however , has prepared an Executive order under which many of the restrictions imposed on the agency by the Carter Administration would be lifted . The CIA , for example , might be able to use the Peace Corps and students abroad as undercover agents . This proposal has led some Senate Intelligence Committee members , as one put it , to believe that " the White House favors anything over at the CIA so long as it 's not embarrassing .
