This winter may be bleaker than usual in the U.S.S.R. With cold weather fast approaching and an increasingly militant labor force threatening to paralyze the transportation system , supplies of food and fuel could be in jeopardy . Soviet leaders reacted with old-style authority by proposing sweeping emergency measures : a ban on all strikes for 15 months and deployment of troops to break an Azerbaijani blockade of Armenia . But after a dramatic all- night debate , legislators in the Supreme Soviet did what not so long ago was unthinkable . They rebuffed the strike proposal as " unconstitutional " and voted instead to put strict limits only on work stoppages that affect critical industries . Said Leningrad Deputy Anatoli Sobchak , a reformist : " We just spent a couple days in the school of democracy . And all the talk led somewhere . " <P> For Soviet lawmakers , it was a unique lesson in the art of compromise . President Mikhail Gorbachev , who supported the emergency-powers proposal , had * opened the session with an emotional address , telling the legislature that work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What followed was an often fiery , unprecedented debate as politicians clashed over the need for such draconian measures . At one point , Gorbachev yelled at the unruly Deputies , " We 're not in a stadium ! We 're in the Supreme Soviet ! " <P> Gorbachev 's concern over labor unrest is well grounded . Since last July , when Soviet coal miners went on a three-week strike to protest their squalid living conditions and the government caved in to their demands , long-suffering Soviet workers have found work stoppages a potent weapon . So have restive national groups . For more than a month , railways have been blocked between the tiny Caucasus republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia , which are battling for control of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh . The blockade has severely curtailed supplies of food , medicine and gasoline in Armenia . Last week coal miners in the Ukrainian town of Chervonograd held a brief warning strike to demand immediate implementation of government pledges to raise wages and improve conditions . When one Minister called for postponing the expensive concessions , Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must keep its word , " he said . Soviet legislators are concerned that if such strikes continue or spread , they could push the shaky Soviet economy to total collapse . <P> Despite Gorbachev 's original inclination to take quick and drastic action , he hesitated to go as far as some had demanded , and initiated the bargaining session that sharply reduced the scope of the emergency plan . After the vote , Gorbachev seemed to recognize that he had presided over a new chapter in Soviet history . " I think we 've done the right thing , " he said . Even the more moderate measures may help cool the rash of strikes . More important , one of Gorbachev 's crucial reforms seemed to be working : an elected legislature had debated and bargained its way to a sensible compromise . Just how much respite the decision will bring the Soviet Union 's battered economy is another matter . The rail blockade of Armenia was broken last week when Soviet troops escorted in shipments of food , fuel and other vital supplies . But leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military tries to take over the railways .
