Reflections on a week of anxiety , sadness and outrage <P> It took a week to get the picture . First came the gasps and " not agains " ; then the nation assumed its old too familiar position before the tube , reluctant pros in this business by now , ready to take in the slow-motion replays , the testimony of experts , the edgy reporters , a bloody head , a shot-up limousine , another blank-faced gunman . There was a jumble to sort out . The President was O.K. But then he was n't . They took him to the White House . No , to a hospital . Was it serious ? Not very . Yes , very . Maybe ... And so on through the long Monday afternoon , the emotions buffeted by every bulletin-sinking at the report of White House Press Secretary James Brady 's death ; rising warily when the report is denied ; a freeze at news that the President is undergoing surgery ; a thaw when someone repeats a Reagan joke . Who was that fool who asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still-the public 's tensions not at all alleviated by the figure of Alexander Haig claiming " I am in control here , " in a voice full of jelly . <P> The press was hard on Haig after the recent who's-in-charge tempest . Suddenly the Secretary of State is playing air raid warden again and rearranging the order of succession to the presidency to suit his pride . Yet he was only trying to do what everyone wanted : to establish order and clear things up . By 7 p.m. there was at least the start of a clearing up . To stage center stepped Dr. Dennis O'Leary of George Washington University Hospital , a gentle , cool customer , another instant media star . Secret Service Agent Timothy J. McCarthy was hit in the stomach , but doing well . D.C. Policeman Thomas K. Delahanty was hit in the shoulder and neck ; his condition was stable . A .22-cal. bullet passed through Jim Brady 's brain . And the President ? He became his chest for the moment : the bullet entered here , bounced off this , settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " thoracotomy " and some " peritoneal lavage " to boot . <P> But was he O.K. ? Yes , he was fine , chipper . By nightfall the country was beginning to do some oxygenating of its own . <P> Within a day or two pieces were beginning to fit , even the weirdest . To the bare fact of the suspect 's name , John W. Hinckley Jr. , were added the details of a strangely American life , or half life . The son of oil-rich respectability quits school , takes to the road , joins the American Nazi party , but ca n't make it there . <P> He has a guitar , of course ; drives a tan Plymouth with Texas plates ; watches TV in cheap motels where he stops briefly . He is a traveling man . Soft-spoken and polite . He dines on Whoppers and writes love notes to a teen-age movie star at Yale-while going madder by the minute , buying guns and hitting the dream cities of Denver , Nashville , Dallas and L.A. , until he arrives by Greyhound at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is driven to penetrate . So after a while even he becomes real . At week 's end one understands not everything , but a lot more than seemed possible on frantic Monday . The people were in control here .
