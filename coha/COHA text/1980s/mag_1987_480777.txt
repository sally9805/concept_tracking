My mother 's name was Edna Akin , and she was born in 1910 , in the far northwest corner of the state of Arkansas ? Benton County ? in a place whose actual location I am not sure of and never have been . Near Decatur or Centerton , or a town no longer a town . Just a rural place . That is near the Oklahoma line there , and in 1910 it was a rough country , with a frontier feel . It had only been ten years since robbers and outlaws were in the landscape . Bat Masterson was still alive and not long gone from Galina . I remark about this not because of its possible romance , or because I think it qualifies my mother 's life in any way I can relate now , but because it seems like such a long time ago and such a far-off and unknowable place . And yet my mother , whom I loved and knew quite well , links me to that foreignness , that other thing that was her life and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is one quality of our lives with our parents that is often overlooked and so , devalued . Parents link us ? closeted as we are in our lives ? to a thing we 're not but they are ; a separateness , perhaps a mystery ? so that even together we are alone . The act and practice of considering my mother 's life is , of course , an act of love . And my inRichard Ford is the author of The Sportswriter , a novel , and Rock Springs , a collection of stories to be published in September by Atlantic Monthly Press . complete memory of it , my inadequate relation to the facts , should not be thought incomplete love . I loved my mother the way a happy child does , thoughtlessly and without doubts . And when I became an adult and we were adults who knew one another , we regarded each other highly ; could say " I love you " when it seemed necessary to clarify our dealings , but without pausing over it . That seems perfect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life I am forced to piece together . We were not a family for whom history had much to offer . This fact must have to do with not being rich , or with being rural , or incompletely educated , or just inadequately aware of many things . For my mother there was simply little to history , no heroics or self-dramatizing ? just small business , forgettable residues , some of them mean . The Depression had something to do with it , too . My mother and father were people who lived for each other and for the day . In the thirties , after they were married , they lived , in essence , on the road . They drank some . They had a good time . They felt they had little to look back on , and did n't look . My father 's family came from Ireland and were Protestants . This was in the 1870s , and an ocean divided things . But about my mother 's early life I do n't know much . I do n't know where her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Polish . He was a carter , and my mother 44 11ARPER 'S MAGAZINE ' , AUGUST But I have thought of them as a young couple . My mother , black-haired , dark-eyed , curvaceous . My father , blue-eyed like me , big , gullible , honest , gentle . 1 can think a thought of them together . I can sense what they each must 've sensed pretty fast ? here was a good person , suddenly . My mother knew things . She had worked in hotels , been to boarding school and out . Lived in cities . Traveled some . But my father was a country boy who quit school in the seventh grade . The baby of three children , all raised by their mother ? the sheltered son of a suicide . I can believe my mother wanted a better life than working for her ambitious stepfather and contrary mother , at jobs that went no place ; that she may have believed she 'd not been treated well , and thought of her life as " rough " ; that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a strange life ; that she was in danger of losing all expectation ; that she was bored . And I can believe my father simply saw my mother and wanted her . Loved her . And that was how that went . They were married in Morrilton , Arkansas , by a justice of the peace , in 1928 , and arrived at my father 's home in Atkins the next morning , newlyweds . I have no correct idea what anyone thought or said about any of that . They acted independently , and my mother never felt the need to comment . Though my guess is they heard disapproval . Ithink it is safe to say my parents wanted who was not much older than my father ? four years , at most . I think they were just caught up in their life , a life in the South , in the thirties , just a kind of swirling thing that did n't really have a place to go . There must 've been plenty of lives like that then . It seems a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to them , of course , it was just their life . Something about that time ? to my mother ? must 've seemed unnarratable . Unworthy of or unnecessary for telling . My father , who was not a teller of stories anyway , never got a chance to recall it . And 1 , who was n't trained to want the past filled in ? as some boys are ? just never asked . It seemed a privacy I should n't invade . And I know that my mother 's only fleeting references to that time , as if the thirties were just a long weekend drinking too much , wild-ness , rootlessness ? gave me the impression something possibly untidy had gone on , some recklessness of spirit and attitude , something that a son would be better off not to think about and be worried with . In essence , it had been their time , for their purposes and not mine . And it was over . But looked at from the time of my birth , 1944 , all that life lived childless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to her ; a life encapsulatable , possibly even remembered unclearly , pointless , maybe in comparison to the pointedness of a life with a child . Still , an intimacy established between the two of them that they brought forward into more consequential life ? a life they had all but abandoned any thought of because no children had come . All first children , and certainly all only children , date the beginning of their lives as extraspecial events . For my parents my arrival came as a surprise and coincident with the end of World War II ? the event that finished the thirties in this country . And it came when my mother had been married to my father fifteen years ; when , in essence , their young life was over . He was thirty-nine . She was thirty-three . They , by all accounts , were happy to have me . It may have been an event that made their life together seem conventional for once , that settled them ; made them think about matters their friends had thought about years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house or a car , although my father 's job gave him a company car . They had never had to choose a " home , " a place to be in permanently . But now , they did .

There was going to he a baby . 46 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE/AUGUST About my mother I do not remember more than pieces up until the time I was sixteen : 1960 , a galvanizing year for us both ? the year my father woke up gasping on a Saturday morning and died before he could get out of bed ; me up on the bed with him , busy trying to find something to help .

Eventually she just lost her control for a while . But before that . Those pieces . They must make a difference or I would n't remember them so clearly . A flat tire we all three had , halfway across the Mississippi bridge at Greenville . High , up there , over the river . We stayed in the car while my father fixed it , and my mother heldme so tightly to her I could barely breathe . I was six . She always said , " 1 smothered you when you were little . You were all we had . I 'm sorry . " And then she 'd tell me this story . But I was n't sorry . It seemed fine then , since we were up there .

Just running away . I remember that scared me and I yelled at her , " No , " and halfway across 48 H ARPER 'S MAGAZINE / AUGUST and it is true my new friends took me up . My mother went to work . She got a job doing something at a company that made school pictures . It required training and she did it . And it was only then , late in 1960 , when she was fifty , that she first felt the effects of having quit school in 1924 . But she got along , came home tired . I do not think she had trouble . And then she left that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , tried afterward to get the job as manager but did n't get it ? who knows why ? She took another job as night cashier in a hotel , the Robert E. Lee . This job she kept maybe a year . And after that she was the admitting clerk in the emergency room at the University of Mississippi Hospital , a job she liked very much . And there was at least one boyfriend in all that time . A married man , from Tupelo , named Matt , who lived in the apartment building she worked at . He was a big , bluff man , in the furniture business , who drove a Lincoln and carried a gun strapped to the steering column . I liked him . And I liked it that my mother liked him . It did n't matter that he was married ? not to me , and I guess not to my mother . I really have no idea about what was between them , what they did alone . And I do n't care about that , either . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his airplane . Acted respectfully to both of us . She may have told me she was just passing time , getting her mind off her worries , letting someone be nice to her . But I did n't care . And we both knew that nothing she told me about him either did or did n't have to match the truth . I would sometimes think I wished she would marry Matt . And at other times I would be content to have them be lovers , if that 's what they were . He had boys near my age , and later I would even meet them and like them . But this was after he and my mother were finished . What finished them was brought on by me but was not really my doing , I think now . Matt had faded for a time . His business brought him in to Jackson , then out for months . She had quit talking about him , and life had receded to almost a normal level .

But one night for some reason she simply did n't come home . I had a test the next day . Algebra . And I must 've been in an agitated state of mind . I called the hotel to hear she had left on time . And for some reason this scared me . I got in my car and drove down to the neighborhood by the hotel , a fringe neighborhood near a black section of town . I rode the streets and found her car , a gray and pink ' 58 Oldsmobile that had been my father 's pride and joy . It was parked under some sycamore trees , across from the apartments where she had worked as a rental agent and where Matt lived . And for some reason I think I panicked . It was not a time to panic but I did anyway . I 'm not sure what I thought , but thinking of it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was there if he knew where my mother was . This may be right , though it 's possible , too , I knew she was there and just wanted to make her leave . I went in the building ? it must 've been midnight ? and up the elevator and down the hall to his door . I banged on it . Hit it hard with my fists . And then I waited . Matt himself opened the door , but my mother was there in the room behind him . She had a drink in her hand . The lights were on , and she was standing in the room behind him . It was a nice apartment , and both of them were shocked by me . I do n't blame them . I did n't blame them then and was ashamed to be there . But I was , I think , terrified . Not that she was there . Or that I was alone . But just that I did n't know what in the hell . Where was she ? What else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being out of breath . I was seventeen years old . And I really ca n't remember what anybody said or did except me , briefly . " Where have you been ? " I said to her . " I did n't know where you were . That 's all . " And that was all . All of that . Matt said very little . My mother got her coat and we went home in two cars . She acted vaguely annoyed at me , and I was mad at her . We talked that night . Eventually she said she was sorry , and I told her I did n't care if she saw Matt only that she tell me when she would be home late . And to my knowledge she never saw Matt Matthews , or any other man , again as a lover as long as she lived .. , Later , years later , when she was dying , I tried to explain it all to her again ? my part , what I thought , had thought ? as if we could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was call me or , even years later , say she would 've called me . But that was not , of course , what she did or how she saw it . She just looked a little disgusted and shook her head . " Oh , that , " she said . " My God . That was just silliness . You had no business coming up there . You were our of your mind . Though I just saw I could n't be doing things like that . I had a son to raise . " And here again she looked disgusted , and at everything , I think . All the cards the fates had dealt her ? a no-good childhood , my father 's death , me , her own inability to vault over all of this to a better life . It was another proof of something bad , the likes of which she felt , I believe , she 'd had plenty .

These were all matters a boy should take up with his father , of course . Though , really , whoever would ? I know I would n't have . Such a conversation would 've confused and embarrassed my poor father and me . We did not know each other that well at our closest moments . And in any case , he was gone . But my mother I knew very well At least I acted that way and she did , too . She was fifty-two . I was eighteen . She was practiced with me , knew the kind of boy I was . We were partners in my messes and hers . I sat on the couch and carefully told her what scared me , told her what I could n't get worked out right in my thinking , went through it all ; used the words it , hers , in . And she , stifling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fine . Nobody got pregnant doing what we were doing , and I should forget about it . It was all a young girl 's scare fantasies . Not to worry . And so I did n't . Of course , she was wrong . Could n't possibly have been wronger . My girlfriend did n't get pregnant , but only because a kind fate intervened . Thousands of people get pregnant doing what we were doing . Thousands more get pregnant doing much less . I guess my mother just did n't know that much , or else understood much more : that what was done was done now , and all the worry and explaining and getting-straight would n't matter . I should be more careful in the future if 1 was to have one . And that was about it . If Louise was pregnant , what anybody thought would n't matter . Best just not to worry . And there is , of course , a lesson in that ? one I like and have tried ever since and unsuccessfully to have direct me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hers were then . Not yet . I have never exactly felt how little all you can do can really matter . Full understanding will come to me , and undoubtedly to us all . But my mother showed that to me first , and best , and I think I may have begun to understand it even then . In the sixties after that I went away to colply going , and it would he my lookout . She was interested , but in a way that was not vital or supervisory . I do n't think she thought that 1 would go away for good , even when it happened that Michigan State took me and I said 1 was going . I do n't know what she thought exactly . She had other things on her mind then . Maybe she thought Michigan was n't so far from Mississippi , which is true and not true , or that I would n't stay and would come home soon . Maybe she thought I would never go . Or maybe she thought nothing , or nothing that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , sending and getting letters , setting dates , and decided she would cross that bridge when the time came . And it did come . In September 1962 , she and I got on the Illinois Central in Jackson and rode it to Chicago ( our first such trip together ) . We transferred crosstown to the old La Salle Street Station and the Grand Trunk Western , and rode up to Lansing . She wanted to go with me . I think she wanted just to see all that . Michigan . Illinois . Cornfields . White barns . The Middle West . Wanted to see from a train window what went on there , how that was . What it all looked like , possibly to detect how I was going to fit myself among those people , live in their buildings , eat their food , learn their lingo . Why this was where I had chosen to go . Her son . This was how she saw her duty unfolding . And , too , the ordinary may have been just what she wanted : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see herself and me , for a moment in time , fitted into the pattern of what other people were up to , what people in general did . If it could happen to her , to us , that way , then maybe some normal life had reconvened , since she could not have thought of her life as normal then . So , at the end of that week , late September 1962 , when I had enrolled , invaded my room , met my roomies , and she and I had spent days touring and roaming , eating motel dinners together until nothing was left to say , I stood up on a bus-stop bench beside the train tracks , at the old GTW station in Lansing , and held up my arms in the cool , snapping air for her to see me as she pulled away back toward Chicago . And I saw her , her white face recessed behind the tinted window , one palm flat to the glass for me to see . And she was crying . Good-bye , she was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Good-bye . I love you , " and watched the train go out of sight through the warp of that bricky old factory town . And at that moment I suppose you could say I started my own life in earnest , and whatever there was left of my childhood ended . 52 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE i AUGUST After that the life that would take us to the end began . A fragmented , truncated life of visits long and short . Letters . Phone calls . Telegrams . Meetings in cities away from home . Conversations in cars , in airports , train stations . Efforts to see each other . Leaving dominating everything ? my growing older , and hers , observed from varying distances . She held out alone in Mississippi for a year , moved back into the house on Congress Street . She rented out the other side , worked at the hospital , where for a time , 1 think , the whole new life she 'd been handed worked out , came together . I am speculating , as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said she liked her job , liked the young interns at the hospital , liked the drama of the ER , liked working even . It may have started to seem satisfactory enough that 1 was away . It may have seemed to her that there was a life to lead . That under the circumstances she had done reasonably well with things ; could ease up , let events happen without fearing the worst . One bad thing did finally turn into something less bad . This , at least , is what I wanted to think . How a son feels about his widowed mother when he is far away becomes an involved business . But it is not oversimplifying to say that he wants good to come to her . In all these years , the years of fragmented life with my mother , I was aware ( as I have said ) that things would never be completely all right with her again . Partly it was a matter of choosing ; partly it was a matter just of her own character ? of just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him gone and so much life left to be lived in a not ideal way . Always she was resigned somewhere down deep . I could never plumb her without coming to that stop point ? a point where expectation simply ceased . This is not to say she was unhappy after enough time had passed . Or that she never laughed . Or that she did n't see life as life , did n't regain and rejoin herself . All those she did . Only , not utterly , not in a way a mother , any mother , could disguise to her only son who loved her . I always saw that . Always felt it . Always felt her ? what ? ? discomfort at life ? Her resisting it ? Always wished she could relent more than she apparently could ; since in most ways my own life seemed to spirit ahead , and I did not like it that hers did n't . From almost the first I felt that my father 's death surrendered to me at least as much as it took away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs , gave me my own decisions . A hoy could do worse than to lose his father ? a good father , at that ? just when the world begins to display itself all around him . But that is not the way it was with her , even as I ca n't exactly say how it was . I can say that in all the years after my father died , twenty-one years , her life never seemed quite fully engaged . She took trips ? to Mexico , to New York , to California , to Banff , to islands . She had friends who loved her and whom she spoke well of She had an increasingly easy life as her own parents died . She had us ? my wife and me who cer-tainly loved her and included her in all we could . But when I would say to her ? and l did say this " Mother , are you enjoying your life ? Are things all right ? " she would just look at me impatiently and roll her eyes . " Richard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ecstatic . It 's not in my nature . You concentrate on your life . Leave mine alone . I 'll take care of me . " And that , I think , is mostly what she did after his death and my departure , when she was on her own : she maintained herself , made a goal of that . She became brisk , businesslike , more self-insistent . Her deep voice became even deeper , assumed a kind of gravity . Shc drank in the evenings to get a little drunk , and took up an attitude ( particularly toward men , whom she began to see as liabilities ) . She made her situation be the custom and cornerstone of her character . Would not be taken advantage of by people , though I suspect no one wanted to . A widow had to look out , had to pay attention to all details . No one could help you . A life lived efficiently would n't save you , no ; but it would prepare you for what you could n't really be saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife , at a distance and as we needed it . She maintained her mother , who finally grew ill , then crippled , but never appreciative . She maintained her stepfather ? moved , in fact , back to Little Rock . She sold her house , hers and my father 's first house , and lived with my grandparents in the hotel , and later ? after Ben died ? in apartments here and there in the town . She became a daughter again at fifty-five , one who looked after her elderly mother . They had money enough . A good car . A set of friends who were widowed , too ? people in their stratum . They accompanied each other . Went to eat in small groups , played canasta afternoons , spoke on the phone , watched TV , planned arguments ; grew bored , impatient , furious . Had cocktails . Laughed about men . Stared . Lived a nice and comfortable life of waiting . Our life during this time ? my mother 's and mine ? consisted of my knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived far away from each other . She in Little Rock . I , and then I and Kristina , in New York , California , Mexico , Chicago , Michigan again , New Jersey , Vermont . To us she arrived on trains and planes and in cars , ready to loan us money and to take us to dinner . To buy us this and that we needed . To have a room painted . To worry about me . To be there for a little while wherever we were and then to go home again . It must be a feature of anyone 's life to believe that particular circumstances such as these are not exactly typical of what the mass of other lives are like . Not better . Not worse . Only peculiar in some way . Our life , my mother 's and mine , seemed peculiar . Or possibly it is just im , perfect that it seemed . Being away . Her being alone . Our visits and departings . All this consumed twenty years of both our lives ? her last twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be was beginning . It never felt exactly right to me that during all these years I could not see my mother more , that we did not have a day-to-day life , That the repairs we made to things after my father 's death could not be shared entirely . I suppose that nowhere in time was there a moment when life for us rejoined itself as it had been before he died . This imperfection underlay everything . And when she left again and again and again , she would cry . And that is what she cried about . That we would never rejoin , that that was gone . This was all there was . Not quite enough . Not a full enough repaying of all that time together lost . She told me once that in an elevator a woman had asked her , " Mrs. Ford , do you have any children ? " And she had said , " No . " And then thought to herself , " Well , yes , I do . There 's Richard . " Our conversations over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies we had seen and had n't , with books she was reading , with baseball .

We took her on the Universal Tour . We took her back to Antoine 's . We drove her to California and to Montreal . To Maine . To Vermont . To northern Michigan . To wherever we went that we could take her . We , she and I , observed each other . She observed my wife and my marriage and liked them both . She observed my efforts to be a writer and did not fully under- stand them . " But when are you going to get a job and get started ? " she asked me once . She observed the fact that we had no children and offered no opinion . She observed her life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to the other . I observed that she grew older ; saw that life was not entirely to her liking and that she made the most of its surfaces ? taking a job once in a while , then finally retiring . I observed that she loved me ; would sometimes take me aside early on a morning when we could be alone together as two adults and say : " Richard , are you happy ? " And when I told her I was , she would warn , " You must be happy . That 's so important . " And that is the way life went on . Not quite pointlessly . But not pointedly , either . Maybe this is typical of all our lives with our parents ? a feeling that some goal should be reached , then a recognition of what that goal inevitably is , and then returning attention to what 's here and present today . To what 's only here . Something , some essence of life , is not corning clear through these words . There are not words enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory enough to give a life back and have it be right , exact .

I have not even said about her that she did n't interfere . That she agreed my life with Kristina had retired a part of her motherhood . That she did n't cultivate random judgments . That she saw her visits as welcome , which they were . Indeed , she saw that what we 'd made of things ? she and I ? was the natural result of prior events that were themselves natural . She was now , as before , not a psychologist . Not a quizzer . She played the cards she was dealt . By some strange understanding , we knew that this was life . This is what we would have . We were fatalists , mother and son . And we made the most of it . In 1973 , my mother discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A friend of my mother 's , a man named Ed , met me and drove me in .

But really it was more than her death . Singular life itself ? hers in particular , ours ? was moving into a new class of events now . These things could be understood , is what he meant to say to me . And to hold out against them was hopeless and also maybe perverse . This all was becoming a kind of thing that happens .

Be him or like him . It was better . And that is what I did . My mother , it turned out , was feeling better . But something very unusual had happened to her . Her heart had stopped . There had been congestion in her lungs , the doctor told me and her . He had already performed some more tests , and the results were n't good . He was a small , curly-headed , bright-eyed young man . He was soft-spoken , and he liked my mother , remembered how she 'd looked when she first came to see him .

And I know he was sorry to know it and to say it , and in a way his job may even have been harder than ours was then . I do not really remember what we said to him . I 'm sure we asked very good questions , since we were both good when the chips were down . I do not remember my mother crying . I know I did not cry .

To accept less than life when it is not absolutely necessary is stupid . I think we had talks . She was getting out of the hospital again , and at least in my memory I stayed around and got our with her before I had to go back to my job . We made plans for a visit . More going . She would come to Massachusetts when she was strong enough . We could still imagine a future , and that was exactly all we asked for . I went back to teaching , and talked to her most days , though the thought that she was getting worse , that bad things were going on there and 1 could n't stop them , made me miss some days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life felt ruined , futureless , edging toward disappointments . She stayed out of the hospital during that time , took blood transfusions , which seemed to make her feel better , though they were ominous . 1 think she went out with her friends . Had company . Lived as if life could go on . And then in early October she came north . I drove down to New York , picked her up and drove us back to my rented house in Vermont . It was misty , and most of the leaves were down . And in the house it was cold and bleak , and I took her out to dinner in Bennington just to get warm . She said she had had another transfusion for the trip and would stay with me until its benefits wore off and she was weak again . And that was how we did that .
