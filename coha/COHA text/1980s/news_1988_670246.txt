For years , the cost of a road trip to , say , Yellowstone National Park has been largely determined by the councils of OPEC . But not this summer . Long-term changes in the gasoline business  --  as well as some special , short-term factors  --  have drastically altered the dynamics of pricing in the more than $150 billion-a-year gasoline market . " Things aren ' t crystal clear anymore , " says Thomas Burns , manager of economics at Chevron Corp . " The underlying reasons for price moves are more obscure . " The effect , however , is clear enough : Retail gasoline prices have remained firm , despite depressed prices for crude oil . In the long run , of course , the price of crude will continue to control whether gasoline prices rise or fall . But this summer , at least , " the gasoline market is marching to its own drummer , " says Trilby Lundberg , whose Lundberg Letter tracks retail gasoline prices across the country . Gasoline prices currently average around $1 a gallon nationwide , up about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot-market price of crude has dropped more than $4 a barrel in the same period , to $15. 45 as of Friday . What ' s more , U.S. gasoline inventories have fallen sharply in recent weeks , to almost 10% below last year ' s levels , while stocks of crude oil are nearly 11% higher than they were a year ago . ( Last week ' s explosion of a huge North Sea oil platform could help to shrink those inventories somewhat by eliminating for a time 300 , 000 barrels a day of production from the glutted crude market . ) One reason for the resilience of gasoline prices , some independent marketers say , is that the major oil companies ' grip on the market is growing tighter in many areas . The majors can exclude costly middlemen by refining and selling their own products , in addition to producing the crude from which they ' re made . With their lower costs and deeper pockets , the major companies have been gobbling up larger chunks of regional markets at a time when independent station owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steven Riggins , whose family runs 16 gas stations in New Jersey , says half of the independent gasoline wholesalers in his market have dropped out in just the past year . As a result , he notes , he ' s stuck with buying more often from major companies , and pricing is less competitive . " There ' s definitely not the pick anymore , " he says . Demand , which averaged 7. 2 million barrels a day in 1987 and is expected to jump a hefty 2% this year , is also bolstering gasoline prices . Even as the price creeps up , gasoline remains a bargain in the minds of most U.S. motorists . Only five years ago , regular unleaded in such areas as New York City cost $1. 24 a gallon , compared with a top price there of $1. 07 a gallon today . And with many states abolishing the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit , autos are soaking up more fuel . Moreover , the declining value of the U.S. dollar is promoting more domestic vacations while attracting tourists from overseas . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving vacations this year than the 243 million taken last year . Through May , the Automobile Club of New York had fielded nearly 120 million requests for highway-travel information , up 7% from a year ago . " Our branches have never been so crowded , " says a club spokesman . The supply side , too , is keeping gasoline prices strong . On a regional basis , a number of special factors are tipping the balance against the consumer . For one thing , the delivery each day of at least 50 , 000 barrels of gasoline along the Mississippi River has been slowed because of drought conditions in that area . The tugboat Amoco Missouri River , for instance , is spending 15 days rather than the usual five to push its gasoline barges between two terminals . Another drought-related problem : Low river levels are permitting saltwater to reach farther north in Louisiana . This has forced some coastal refineries to use barges , at great expense , to bring in the fresh water needed for their operations . Meanwhile , a spate of breakdowns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut back on gasoline production in recent weeks . The explosion in May of Shell Oil Co. ' s huge Norco , La. , refinery alone took 130 , 000 barrels of gasoline a day off the market . " The Shell explosion sure hasn ' t helped , " says Ted Eck , chief economist for Amoco Corp . Indeed , even while operating nearly flat out last month , U.S. refineries were able to supply only about 294 million gallons of gasoline daily  --  against demand of 319 million gallons a day . The shortfall was filled from inventories and through imports from Venezuela , Brazil and Canada . A broader factor in the production squeeze is that the number of refineries in the U.S. has dwindled by almost a third , to 213 , since the abolition earlier this decade of oil price controls , which virtually assured refiners of a profit . Of the survivors , no more than 15 provide 80% of the gasoline used by U.S. motorists , says Vic Rasheed , executive director of Service Station Dealers of America , a Washington-based trade group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has the yield of gasoline from a barrel of crude , thanks to a government ban on using lead additives to boost octane . This problem is likely to become only more acute as motorists clamor for greater quantities of high-octane premium gasoline to fuel increasingly popular high-performance automobiles . " The industry is producing ( gasoline ) at close to sustainable capacity already , " says Rodger W. Murtaugh , vice president of operations , planning and transportation for Amoco . He calls current gasoline supplies " tight but manageable . " Mr. Burns , the Chevron economist , says similarly that , after years of glut , gasoline supplies are in " fairly good balance . " But this , he adds , means " any accumulation of small things can tip that balance . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
