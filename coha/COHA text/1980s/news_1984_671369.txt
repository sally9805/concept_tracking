By a vote of 7 to 2 , the Court agreed with two lower Federal courts that the collegiate governing body ' s exclusive **28;1076; <> // Excerpts from opinions , page B8. power to regulate the number of television appearances by a football team and to negotiate the price of those appearances was an " unreasonable restraint of trade " that violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. // The University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia , two college football powers that had long argued for a greater voice in the N.C.A.A. ' s television plan , brought the antitrust suit in 1981. // The effect of the ruling will almost certainly be to increase the amount of college football on television and , particularly , to increase exposure forthe major teams , many of which have chafed under the appearance limitations . The ruling left open the possibility of a continued role for the N.C.A.A. in football-telecast regulation , but on a reduced level. // The High Court said that by imposing limits on the games the networks may broadcast , and by setting an artificially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect a " classic cartel " that had " restricted rather than enhanced the place of intercollegiate athletics in the nation ' s life. " // Spokesmen for the N.C.A.A. , which has not placed such limits on any other major sport , said they would have no comment until the organization ' s lawyers had a chance to study the decision . But contingency plans have been circulating among various college football conferences for months in anticipation of today ' s ruling , and athletic directors at several schools expressed confidence today that a new system of television contracts , based on voluntary cooperation among the schools , would be in place in time for the start of the football season late this summer. // The ruling today abrogates the final two years of the N.C.A.A. ' s current four-year contracts with ABC and CBS . Whether those networks continue to televise college football next season depends on their ability to negotiate new agreements under whatever system the schools make available. // Under the old contracts , ABC and CBS paid $131 , 750 , 000 each for the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regionally , each year . Of that sum , the amount that an individual school received for having its team appear in a single televised game varied from year to year . Last season the figure for a major college in a national telecast was $600 , 000 , which the school shared with its conference. // Under the N.C.A.A. plan ' s " appearance requirements , " no college team could appear more than six times in two years , and each network had to schedule appearances for at least 82 schools in each two-year period . No school was permitted to negotiate television rights on its own. // The plan was allowed to operate last season only because Associate Justice Byron R. White issued a stay last July of a Federal appeals court ' s decision so that the Supreme Court could consider the case. // In its ruling today , the Court agreed with the findings of a Federal district judge in Oklahoma City , Juan Burciaga , that " many more " games would be shown on television if colleges were able to negotiate their own television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial restraint on output is the classic mark of a cartel. // Judge Burciaga struck down the television plan in September 1982 , and his decision was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in May 1983. // The Court today rejected all the arguments that the N.C.A.A. had marshaled for its appeal . Writing for the Court , Associate Justice John Paul Stevens said that neither the need to balance competition among member schools nor the need to preserve a live audience for college football could justify the " naked restraint on price and output " that he said characterized the television plan. // <> <> Justice Abrupt in Dismissal // // Justice Stevens , an antitrust specialist before he became a Federal judge , was particularly abrupt in dismissing one of the N.C.A.A. ' s key legal arguments . The N.C.A.A. had argued that it lacked the requisite " market power " to restrain trade , because its product was just one among many forms of television entertainment. // Justice Stevens said it was " evident " that the N.C.A.A. possessed market power because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no reasonable substitute. " // Although the Court ruled that the N.C.A.A. can not exercise exclusive control over the price and output of college football telecasts , it did not completely rule out any related future role for the organization . In a dissenting opinion , Justice White emphasized that point , noting that the N.C.A.A. had " substantial remaining authority " to regulate various aspects of its member schools ' relationship with the television networks . <> <> Justice White ' s Views // // For example , Justice White said , the N.C.A.A. could prevent its members from appearing in televised games on Friday nights , in competition with high school football . And he said that nothing in the majority opinion would prevent the N.C.A.A. from requiring its members to pool their television revenues and share the wealth among themselves. // Justice White also said the decision left the N.C.A.A. free to impose some limits on the 506 members that play intercollegiate varsity football , including " reasonable blackout rules to avoid head-to-head competition for television audiences. " // The majority opinion did not directly address those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to give them ample attention in deciding what role the organization can continue to play. // In his dissenting opinion , which Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist joined , Justice White said the goal of the N.C.A.A. was " to provide a public good - a viable system of amateur athletics - that most likely could not be provided in a perfectly competitive market . " He said that by its television restrictions , " the N.C.A.A. insures the continued availability of a unique and valuable product , the very existence of which might be threatened by unbridled competition in the economic sphere . " <> <> ' Critical Role of Amateurism ' // // Although the majority reached a different conclusion , it too took note of what Justice Stevens called the " critical role in the maintenance of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports " played by the N.C.A.A. " There can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play that role , " he continued , but added that " rules that restrict output are hardly consistent with this role. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television restrictions " are apparent . " He continued : " Individual competitors lose their freedom to compete . Price is higher and output lower than they should otherwise be , and both are unresponsive to consumer preference . This latter point is perhaps the most significant , since Congress designed the Sherman Act as a consumer welfare prescription. " // //
