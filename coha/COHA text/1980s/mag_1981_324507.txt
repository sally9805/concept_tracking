The Pope on human rights-and wrongs <P> After eight international tours that have covered IS nations , tumultuous motorcades and clamoring multitudes have become familiar when Pope John Paul II is on the road . But the papal procession across the Philippines last week-his ninth foreign journey and his first to Asia-also displayed ample elements of stagecraft along with spontaneous outpourings of devotion . <P> On the one hand , there were memorable eruptions of unprogrammed exuberance . At Manila 's Baclaran Church , John Paul 's mere appearance sent 2,000 nuns into a wave of near ecstasy . During a pep rally at the University of Santo Toms , tens of thousands of students lustily chanted " J.P . Two , We Love You-You Are Super . " The highest pitch came in Cebu , the cradle of Philippine Catholicism , where the city 's population doubled for the day . Thousands had waited in the open air since the previous night to catch a glimpse of the Pontiff . <P> There were also rehearsed spectacles that were part of a careful plan laid down by autocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had much to gain from a festive association with John Paul . Everywhere , as if on cue , Filipinos were on hand to enact earnest welcoming playlets , sing , dance or pose as " tribesmen " in outdated garb . During one motorcade , a phalanx of trained water buffalo knelt in reverence just as the pontifical car swept by , while at another point a beaming bride and groom in a mock wedding paused in mid-ceremony to wave to the Pope from a bamboo roadside chapel . <P> Throughout , the Filipinos saw and heard a many-sided Pontiff . John Paul was , as always , the charismatic Pope who set multitudes cheering . He was the political Pope , at once scolding his presidential host with a sermon on human rights and admonishing priests and nuns against revolutionary activism . He was the diplomat-Pope , extending an olive branch to the People 's Republic of China and appealing for Muslim-Christian harmony on blood-soaked Mindanao . He was the doctrinaire Pope , zealously condemning artificial birth control in a nation with one of the most rapidly growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fondly kissing each member of a delegation of deaf-mutes , or impishly chiding singers who struggled through a rendition of the song Sto Lat ( 100 Years ) in Polish . " The melody is good , " he laughed , " the words so-so . " <P> It was the second papal visit in only a decade to Asia 's one predominantly Christian nation . Pope Paul VI had gone in 1970 , and narrowly escaped serious injury when a crazed man attacked him with a knife . John Paul , history 's most traveled Pope , laid on a punishing 20,000-mile , twelve-day itinerary that included an initial stopover in Muslim Pakistan on the way to Manila , and was to be followed this week with a stop on Guam , four days in Japan , a touchdown in Anchorage , Alaska , and a first-ever papal flight over the North Pole en route to Rome .
