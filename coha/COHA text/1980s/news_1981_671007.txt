Once you dip into those bios , you ' ll discover that the occupants of Mr. Shawn ' s hotel - a mildly seedy resort in the tropics - are no shleppers . The cast of " The Hotel Play " not only includes some first-rate actors - Griffin Dunne , Michael Murphy , Mark Linn-Baker , among others - but also non-actors on holiday : three playwrights ( Ed Bullins , Christopher Durang , Wendy Wasserstein ) , two New Yorker cartoonists ( Frank Modell , Jim Stevenson ) , a fiction writer ( Ann Beattie ) , a movie producer ( Dominick Dunne ) , a jewelry product manager ( Aimee Simons ) , a sales engineer ( Charlie Peruzzi ) and a whole gaggle of artists and children . If anyone ' s still looking for Judge Crater , La Mama may be just the place to renew the search. // These performers aren ' t just milling around , either , and they ' re not holding a private party under the guise of theater . John Ferraro , the director in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high style . As Mr. Shawn ' s addled tourists drift in and out of Michael Moran ' s authentic-looking , two-story set ( lobby and bar below , bedrooms above ) , Mr. Ferraro keeps the timing sharp and the traffic brisk ; with the help of Richard Weinstock ' s music and Gregory C. MacPherson ' s lighting , he adroitly transforms a far-flung collection of blackout bits into a ceaseless flow of life . And when virtually the entire cast comes on stage at once for cocktail hour , the director orchestrates a carnival of overlapping action that ' s worthy of Robert Altman ' s " Nashville . " As the actors are live , rather than screen images , the effect is unusually joyous. // Mr. Shawn ' s play , meanwhile , is not joyous and doesn ' t mean to be . Written before " Our Late Night " and " Marie and Bruce , " this work is unmistakably their precursor . Here , as in his later , tidier and more scatological efforts , Mr. Shawn is unveiling a misanthropic view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hotel ' s married guests abuse and humilate each other and their children with unstinting cruelty ; the single guests devour and degrade each other , in and out of bed . Many of the vacationers " feel sick " ( usually to their stomachs ) , and words like " putrid , " " nauseated " and " disgusting , " as well as the epithets " pig " and " hog , " set the tone . When the characters exchange comic anecdotes , they are invariably about mutilation and death . We hear about a terminally ill pathologist who purchases an artificial lung and an electric neck , and of another fellow who swallowed a live rat that chewed his heart " into a hundred pieces. " // Because the playwright is willing to go for broke to realize his vision - and honorably refuses to make any concessions to so-called good taste - he at times achieves a pungent , heightened form of reality that remakes the meaner alienations of modern life into ferocious comedy . The most absurd gags curdle so quickly that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clad in a kimono , is actually touching as a psychiatrist who finds that he vomits every time he sees an attractive woman . Elizabeth McGovern , so striking as Timothy Hutton ' s persistent girl-friend in the film " Ordinary People , " grabs us here when she off-handedly starts worrying about the color of her shoes while a sadistic lover gives her a fast , postcoital dismissal. // The evening ' s most horrifying - and best - vignette is reserved for the playwright and Ann Lange . Mr. Shawn and Miss Lange play a Strindbergian couple whose hatred boils over in an insult barrage that finally leads the wife to threaten to kill herself . But the husband won ' t even allow his spouse suicide as a weapon in their marital war . " I don ' t fear in the slightest the sight of your dead body , " shrieks Mr. Shawn , before going on to describe the various ways ( depending on the method of suicide ) such a corpse might look . Miss Lange - heretofore a tough antagonist - then falls apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safely categorized under the distancing rubric of black comedy. // But the incendiary , even dangerous , cataclysms of " The Hotel Play " are too few and scattered . The rest of the time , the jokes about death , sex , tourism and bodily functions repeat themselves . We contemplate the narrow spectrum of Mr. Shawn ' s verbal and theatrical palette , and monotony sets in . By the end , there ' s nothing left for the playwright to do but hammer his point home . This he does in a graphic suicide scene in which , predictably , the female victim ' s bedmate ignores the bloody mayhem to go calmly about his own selfish business . While this climax gives the work a formal shape , it still seems that the essence and real merits of " The Hotel Play " could be conveyed by any randomly selected 20-minute passage. // Given the fact that a large role in this play evaporates in roughly a minute , it ' s no surprise that some cast members don ' t register . Among those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cunning hotel clerk , Tom McDermott as a mother-infatuated poet and Tom Costello as a self-made millionaire boar hunter whose father had been " a lavatory attendant in a sewer . " The outstanding nonactors afoot are Mr. Durang , as a cackling , madras-outfitted cashier , and Mr. Bullins , as a diner who is fond of saying " Thank you ever so much " with eerily exaggerated politeness . The vacationer you may most identify with , however , is the one ( Richard Peterson ) who announces that every mean-spirited person on stage makes him sick . " I wish there were some dogs and cats staying in this hotel , " he announces , and , after a while , we come to know just how he feels . <> <> A Misanthropic View <> THE HOTEL PLAY , by Wallace Shawn ; directed by John Ferraro ; setting by Michael Moran ; music by Richard Weinstock ; lighting by Gregory C.
