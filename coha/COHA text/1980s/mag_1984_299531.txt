Washington and the Sandinistas take turns crying wolf <P> Once again the familiar tremors swept through Nicaragua . In the streets of Managua , the capital , dozens of Soviet-made T-55 tanks clattered into defensive positions . Antiaircraft crews manned their batteries , while zealous neighborhood defense committees scurried to dig air-raid trenches . Some 20,000 volunteer coffee pickers were reassigned to local militia units as the Sandinista government announced a " state of alert " affecting the country 's 100,000-member military and security forces . For the third time in two years , the Sandinistas were loudly convinced-or so they said-that U.S. troops were about to invade their soil . <P> Most Nicaraguans , however , remained calm . Despite the government 's repeated alarms , residents of Managua made their way to work as usual on the city 's overcrowded buses . Schoolchildren played outdoors , even gathering in clusters around the squat , forbidding tanks . Occasionally the civic mood was shattered by a sonic boom , which the government attributed to high-flying U.S. SR-71 spy planes violating Nicaraguan airspace . Despite the noisy interruptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> A similar case of schizophrenia seemed to be afflicting the Reagan Administration . At a meeting of the 31-member Organization of American States in Brasilia , Secretary of State George Shultz pooh-poohed the Nicaraguan war hysteria as " self-induced ... based on nothing . " Said he : " Obviously they 're trying to whip up their own population . But I ca n't imagine what the reason is for doing that . " Then Shultz provided a possible answer . The U.S. , he said in reference to Nicaragua 's Soviet-sponsored arms buildup , was " trying to work in any way we can to cast this aggressive and subversive influence out of our hemisphere . " <P> At the State Department and the Pentagon , those sentiments were stated more sharply . Even as U.S. officials repeatedly denied any aggressive intentions toward Nicaragua , they continued to issue stern warnings about the Central American republic 's military buildup , especially the possible acquisition by the Sandinistas of high-performance Soviet-bloc aircraft . The U.S. , said Pentagon Spokesman Michael Burch , would " provide whatever assistance is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military intervention ? Said Burch : " I 'm not willing to include or exclude anything . " <P> The superpower and the minipower had different motives for cranking up the mutual war of nerves . In the wake of President Reagan 's election victory , Washington seemed intent on setting what one official called " the limits of U.S. tolerance " toward Marxist-led Nicaragua . After their somewhat less than democratic election triumph on Nov. 4 , the Sandinistas seemed determined to keep building up their arsenal as rapidly as possible . Neither stance boded particularly well for the process of negotiated peace in the region , which both sides claim to support .
