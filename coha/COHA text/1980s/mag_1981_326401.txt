A Reaganite who may not pass Senate muster <P> Conservative Professor Ernest Lefever , 61 , went to work at the State Department just two weeks after the President 's Inauguration . His posting : Assistant Secretary-designate for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs . Not everyone was ecstatic about the choice ; his detractors included human rights activists , religious groups , liberal politicians and newspaper editorialists . New and popular Presidents , however , tend to be permitted the nominees they want , and Lefever , in testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , airily dismissed his opponents as " Communist-inspired . " Yet after two rancorous days of hearings last week , Lefever appeared to have a good chance of becoming the first Reagan appointee rejected by Congress . Still , vows a top Reagan aide : " We 're hanging with it . " <P> From his rsum , Lefever would seem qualified for the job . He holds a Yale doctorate in ethics , worked on prisoner resettlement in Europe after World War II , wrote an influential 1957 book called Ethics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three universities . He was for 37 years a minister of the pacifist Church of the Brethren . He worked as a speechwriter for Hubert Humphrey in 1960 , and was on the staff of the liberal Brookings Institution for twelve years . Since 1976 Lefever has headed his own conservative think tank in Washington , the Ethics and Public Policy Center . " I 'm a confirmed do-gooder , " said Lefever at his Senate hearing . " My whole life has been oriented around human rights and humanitarian concerns . " <P> True enough . Yet the central tenet of Lefever 's orientation is that human rights should not be a major concern of U.S. foreign policy . Beyond " serving as a good example " and providing military aid to allies , Lefever wrote , " there is little the U.S. Government can or should do to advance human rights . " Two years ago , Lefever recommended to a congressional committee that it remove from U.S. law " all clauses that establish a human rights standard or condition that must be met by another sovereign government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I goofed . " <P> Lefever 's opponents believe the White House goofed in nominating him for the job . They are afraid that his confirmation would signal an official American indifference to human rights violations abroad , thus maybe even encouraging such offenses . Some committee members are troubled that Lefever 's think tank accepted at least $25,000 from the Nestl company after commissioning a study that turned out to support Nestl 's marketing of infant formula in developing countries ( see following story ) . When Lefever told the committee he thought the human rights job offered only " an occasional opportunity to nudge history , " Chairman Charles Percy of Illinois angrily lectured him : " It 's important to do more than nudge history . We want an advocate , a spokesman who is looked to as a leader in the fight for rights . "
