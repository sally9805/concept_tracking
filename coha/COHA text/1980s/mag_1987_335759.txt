What is Brownian motion ? Who said we should burn with a hard , gemlike flame ? How do you translate the phrase comme il faut ? Failure to answer questions like these signifies a catastrophic ignorance , according to E.D. Hirsch Jr. , a professor of English at the University of Virginia and inventor of the latest intellectual parlor game . <P> Hirsch did not set out to produce an entertainment . But this summer , readers seem eager for masochistic diversions . Another finger-wagging polemic about American education , Allan Bloom 's The Closing of the American Mind , has been on the New York Times best-seller list for eleven weeks . Cultural Literacy is equally cranky , and it has already made best-seller lists in New York City , Dallas , Denver , Seattle , San Francisco and Boston . <P> Hirsch establishes his dour tone early on by distinguishing between literacy ( the ability to read one 's own language ) and cultural literacy ( possession of specific information ) . Students may be able to read at a ninth-grade level , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He quotes a Latin pupil astonished to find that she is learning a dead language . " What do they speak in Latin America ? " she demands . A California journalist testifies , " I have not yet found one single student in Los Angeles , in either college or high school , who could tell me the years when World War II was fought . " The Federal Government 's Foundations of Literacy project recently tested 17- year-olds ; samplings show that half can not identify Stalin or Churchill . <P> Hirsch proposes to recover what has been lost : a set of common references . " The more computers we have , " he maintains , " the more we need shared fairy tales , Greek myths , historical images , and so on . " The reason for this seeming paradox is that " if we do not achieve a literate society , the technicians , with their arcane specialties , will not be able to communicate with us nor we with them . That would contradict the basic principles of democracy and must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone , what this amounts to is an advocacy of teaching names , dates and places by rote and providing a context later . Hirsch acknowledges that the method has been derided since Dickens satirized Pedant Thomas Gradgrind ( " Facts , sir ; nothing but Facts ! " ) in Hard Times . But , he counters , " it is n't facts that deaden the minds of young children , who are storing facts in their minds every day with astonishing voracity . It is incoherence  --  our failure to ensure that a pattern of shared , vividly taught , and socially enabling knowledge will emerge from our instruction . "
