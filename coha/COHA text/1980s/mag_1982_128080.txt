The situation was desperate indeed . Here were the Atlanta Braves trying to maintain a one-game lead in the National League 's West Division on the season 's final day  --  and doing a terrible job of it . There was one out in the ninth and the Braves were trailing the Padres 5-1 , having butchered the game at bat and afield . Meanwhile , the San Diego Stadium scoreboard was showing a 2-2 Dodger-Giant score in the seventh inning up at San Francisco . An Atlanta loss and an L.A. win would mean that the division title would be decided by a Monday playoff at Dodger Stadium  --  hardly a pleasing prospect for the Braves . // But as Jerry Royster returned to the Atlanta dugout after flying to left for the second out of the ninth , the Braves suddenly erupted in a volley of cheers and whistles . " What 's going on ? What 's going on ? " demanded Manager Joe Torre . Just this . As Royster passed Padre Catcher Terry Kennedy on his way back to the dugout , Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit a three-run homer . Kennedy was getting his inside info from someone in the Padre dugout , where a radio was tuned in to the L.A.-San Francisco game . Royster passed on the news to his teammates , and there was instant bedlam. // " When I came up to bat , " Royster explained later , " Kennedy said , ' Men on second and third for the Giants , one out . ' ' Great , ' I thought . I took a couple of swings and Terry said , ' Oh , no , two outs . ' I figured , ' Oh , well . ' Then I flied out , and as I was returning , Terry said , ' Do n't worry about it  --  Morgan just hit a three-run homer . ' " // The Braves were no longer interested in the game at hand . As Catcher Matt Sinatro fouled out to end the 5-1 loss , they retired to a lunchroom adjoining their clubhouse for a private TV viewing of the game up north . The atmosphere was by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Atlanta Leftfielder Terry Harper afterward . But as the Giants kept holding off the Dodgers , the Braves ' spirits rose . When the game finally ended at 3:09 PDT in a 5-3 San Francisco win , the Braves sprinted from lunchroom to clubhouse for the requisite wild celebration of cascading champagne , beer , macaroni and shaving cream . // " How to go , Little Joe ! " Coach Sonny Jackson called out , in praise of Morgan , his teammate of long ago . Other Braves shouted hosannas to the entire Giant organization . But though in the end they had needed help from their fellow Dodger-haters up north , the Braves had more than earned their first divisional title since 1969 . Counted out nine days earlier , when they were three games behind L.A. , they had responded by winning two of three from the Padres , two of two from the Giants , one of two from the Dodgers and two more in San Diego going into the season finale . Even so , as Torre said , " It 's fitting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunchroom. " // Indeed , it was an unusual year for the Braves , who were alternately America 's Team and then No One 's Team . // " Never , ever , have I seen a team go from 24 games over .500 to seven over to 18 over , " says Atlanta Pitching Coach Rube Walker , who has witnessed 29 pennant races as player and coach . When the Braves , who won their first 13 games of the season , took a nine-game lead on July 29 , they were embraced by fans all over the U.S. , who saw them on owner Ted Turner 's SuperStation . When Atlanta subsequently lost 11 straight and 19 of 21 , dissipating their entire lead in 10 days , the fans and press began to desert them . The deluge ? Not quite . On Aug. 19 Pascual Perez , a recent acquisition from the Pittsburgh farm system , was supposed to start , but he lost his way driving to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium ; veteran Phil Niekro replaced him , and the Braves began a six-game winning streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted a road map with arrows pointing to the stadium over his locker . The kind of incident that unites team and city ? On Sept. 6 the Braves came home in first place from a successful road trip  --  and drew 9,051 and 7,523 on successive nights . // " The atmosphere 's a little unreal , " says Pinch Hitter-First Baseman Bob Watson . " Kind of ' show me . ' There 's the local devotion to football , and the fans have seen a lot of losing years in baseball . So before the season they were writing us off . We won , and they jumped on the bandwagon . When we lost , they jumped right off . " // The Braves argue that both the fickleness of the fans and the team 's streaky play were godsends . " It 's more important to learn how to lose than win  --  you can tell if the players overadjust or panic , " says Torre , who kept the Braves from panicking by refusing to make wholesale changes during the 21-game nosedive . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a slump before it hits you . " Some players say experiencing the streaks was like going through an early pennant race . Royster feels the Braves learned to handle pressure in a low-pressure situation . " The fans and press had a lot to do with that , " he says . " There was no fan excitement , except early in the year . After our last home game nobody told us , ' Go out and win the pennant . ' We just left town . " // Heading into the last week , though , the pressure was intense indeed . Trailing the Dodgers by one game and facing their last seven games on the road , the Braves were struggling without their power-hitting third baseman , Bob Horner , who had hyperextended his left elbow in a freak base-running accident on Sept. 18 . Horner 's replacement , Royster , was playing well , but Harper , Royster 's substitute in left , was staggering from one bad situation to another . // Harper reported to Atlanta on May 27 from Richmond of the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into second ; he was out for four weeks . Eight days after returning to action , he separated his left shoulder  --  if you can believe this  --  waving a runner from second to third ; he was sidelined for three weeks . In the last game of the season 's penultimate week Harper caught a slicing fly , crossed the foul line and dropped the ball as he tried to brace himself at the fence . The resulting gift homer contributed to a 3-2 loss to the Padres . " The best players do n't get too high or low , " says Harper , 27 , an ingenuous fellow with an expression of perpetual astonishment . " The veterans told me to look at things in positive ways , and that 's what I decided to do . " Brave-watchers were n't impressed ; forgetting that their team had played better on the road than at home all season , they rewrote the old obituaries as Atlanta headed out for its climactic West Coast swing . // Niekro , the 43-year-old knuckleballer , was n't about to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1969 division champs , Niekro said he had a " burning desire " to play in a World Series . To prove it , he two-hit the Giants on Monday night , Sept. 27 , in Candlestick Park . The 7-0 rout gave Atlanta a share of the lead for the first time since Sept. 12 . This was the same Niekro who had been on the disabled list the first two weeks of the season with injuries in umpteen parts of his aged body . Another notable survivor , Shortstop Rafael Ramirez , contributed to the victory with a homer and two RBIs . Considered one of the Braves ' weak links in spring training , Ramirez helped them break a team record for DPs with a league-leading 186 . " He has probably taken more ground balls than anyone in the history of baseball this year , " says Dal Maxvill , the coach who hit them . " And he can hit he finished at .278. " // The following night the Braves won more hearts and minds . They 're viewed as a slugging team , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than homers ( 146 ) . " You ca n't go flat when you play this way , " says Torre . " What you can do is force more aggressive play . " On Tuesday , Royster and Right-fielder Claudell Washington stole three bases apiece , Harper hit a three-run double off the leftfield line , and Atlanta beat San Francisco 8-3 to take a one-game lead over the Dodgers. // The Braves moved to Dodger Stadium on Wednesday night and promptly went two-up by beating the Dodgers 4-3 in 12 innings . Harper homered on an 0-2 pitch off Fernando Valenzuela in the fourth and singled home the go-ahead run in a two-run 12th . " Just trying to make contact , " he said , sounding like a veteran . Royster made four tough plays at third and singled in the eventual winning run . Told he looked comfortable in the field , Royster said , " I 'm glad I 'm fooling people , but it 's pure instinct . I 'm a utility player . " // The Dodgers beat the Braves 10-3 Thursday , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . In perhaps the best clutch performance of his 257-win career , Niekro , 17-4 , threw a three-hitter , hit a two-run homer and beat the Padres 4-0. // Typically , the Braves won by making the most of a glum situation . The Padres put runners on first and third with nobody out in the first when Alan Wiggins doubled on a ball Harper misjudged and Juan Bonilla reached first when Catcher Bruce Benedict muffed a third strike . " The pitch dropped about four feet , " Benedict said . " I knew the knuckler was working . " Niekro escaped by striking out Gene Richards and Terry Kennedy and getting Luis Salazar to line to center . // Niekro 's homer could n't have been more timely . With the Braves leading 1-0 in the eighth and Glenn Hubbard on first , Torre ordered his eighth hitter , Benedict , to sacrifice . The idea was to set up an RBI situation for Washington , not Niekro , but Torre nonetheless told Niekro , " Drive him in . " Niekro ordinarily bats as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooved one . But this was no ordinary at bat : Niekro lined his seventh career homer  --  and first since 1976  --  into the leftfield seats . " I used Bruce 's lighter bat so I could wait a little longer , " Niekro said later . " It was like hitting a golf ball with a wood  --  I hardly felt it . I wanted to drop the bat and take four minutes rounding the bases . " // " I expected him to hit it hard  --  he 's a gamer , " said Royster . " Everybody realizes how much a championship would mean to Phil , " said Benedict . How much ? Normally as excitable as a sleeping dog , Niekro clenched his fist on every out ; by game 's end he had extended his streak of innings without an earned run to 24 . " I 've got a wife and three boys I see only half the year , " Niekro says . " But I 'll be here until we get to the Series or I ca n't get the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Braves gave 46,287 fans and one full moon an object lesson in intelligent , aggressive baseball . Perez may not be able to find Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium , but he had no trouble locating the lower reaches of the strike zone . He threw hard into the sixth inning , whereupon Torre went to his " animals . " Relievers Steve ( Bedrock ) Bedrosian and bearded Gene Garber two-hit the Padres the rest of the way . The final : Braves 4-2. // Aggressive ? " We had to be with Horner out of the lineup , " said First Baseman Chris Chambliss , who hit his 20th homer , a career high , in the third . Otherwise the Braves set up runs with alert advances . Harper singled , stole second and went to third on Royster 's surprise sacrifice bunt in the second . " This was no time to be a hero ; I know if we get him to third we do n't need a hit to score him , " said Royster . Hubbard singled in Harper anyway . And in the ninth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was driven in by a Watson single . // That win turned out to be the Braves ' last of the season , but it was the last one they needed . As they learned the next day , losing can be fun , too .
