SUING THE TOBACCO COMPANIES by Lawrence White Manufacturers of all sorts of products are sued regularly these days by consumers injured by those products . Unsafe ladders , exploding bottles , defective cars , asbestos  --  these are just a few examples of products that have engendered liability cases . Manufacturers now must be extra careful both in designing and in making their wares to ensure that they are harmless . One industry , however , has until now seemed immune from the tide of court-enforced consumer protection . Ironically , it is the tobacco industry , whose products have killed millions of Americans , that has never paid a penny to its victims . In the past the makers of cigarettes and smokeless  --  tobacco products ( snuff and chewing tobacco ) have always been able to defeat suits to hold them liable to consumers . This special immunity may soon be in jeopardy . A new breed of lawyer is emerging around the country . Seasoned by experience in product-liability litigation and aware as never before of the dangers of tobacco , these plaintiffs ' attorneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest and most powerful corporations . From Massachusetts to California , attempts to hold tobacco companies liable are beginning to catch on . If these lawsuits succeed , the tobacco industry will probably never be the same . The bill the tobacco industry might have to pay for the effects of its products is truly monumental . One in every seven deaths may be caused by smoking . As many as 500,000 Americans die of smoking-related illnesses each year . Hundreds of thousands of others suffer chronic diseases as a result of smoking . A pack of cigarettes wouldcost between three and four dollars if the price reflected its health costs , according to economists ' calculations . To most plaintiffs in the current wave of lawsuits , money is a secondary consideration . They and their loved ones have suffered because of tobacco ; by suing they hope to alert others whose lives are in danger . In this way tobacco 's victims will not have died in vain . No Warning Tobacco need not be smoked to result in a deadly disease . A case in Oklahoma has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco . " Dipping snuff " had been a habit of Marvin Sean Marsee 's from the age of 12 until he was diagnosed with oral cancer just before he graduated from high school in Talihina , Oklahoma . Sean was an athlete  --  a star member of his school 's track team . He was voted most outstanding athlete of the year in 1983 . Like most of his fellow athletes , he did n't smoke . The tobacco he used , called " Copenhagen " and " Skoal , " did n't have any health warnings on it , and no one told him it could hurt him . Besides , most of his friends dipped snuff . Carrying a can of tobacco in the back pocket of their jeans was a status symbol , a sign of manhood . The boys would put a pinch of the moist tobacco between their gums and cheek and let it stay there for a while . It was n't easy to get used to at first , but it soon became very hard to give up . As a senior in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold sore on his tongue , A biopsy showed that it was actually a malignant tumor. in the first operation , a few days after Sean graduated in 1983 , the doctors removed a third of Sean 's tongue . Other , much worse , operations followed . The progress of terminal cancer is always an ugly story , but something is particularly awful about oral cancer , which first destroys the tongue , then the throat and finally the jaw . By all accounts , Sean was courageous until he died , a wasted wraith of his former self , on February 25 , 1984 . Almost until the end he hoped he would be able to travel with his doctor , Carl Hook , so they could speak together with young people and warn them about the danger of dipping snuff . Sean 's mother , Betty Ann Marsee , is a widow , a mother of five and a registered nurse . Like Dr. Hook , she knows that Sean 's cancer was caused by dipping snuff ; soon after Sean died she found a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsee went to nearby Ada , Oklahoma , and hired an attorney . Dania Deschamps-Braly agreed to bring a product-liability suit against U.S. Tobacco , the manufacturer of Copenhagen and Skoal , and asked in her pleadings for damages // of $37 million . Mrs. Deschamps-Braly says moist tobacco is widely used in her part of the country and is regarded as harmless by most people . " Why , it 's not unusual to see a father put a pinch of tobacco in a three- or four-year-old 's mouth , " she says . Dr. Hook says many Oklahoma children in the first and second grades , girls as well as boys , are addicted to snuff . Perhaps because of the mistaken belief that dipping snuff is not as dangerous as smoking , sales of smokeless tobacco have increased 31.6 percent over the past ten years , according to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures , while cigarette sales declined 5 percent in 1983 , largely due to the doubling that year of the cigarette tax from 8 to 16 cents , says one Tobacco Institute spokesperson . U.S. Tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase of 8.8 percent from the previous year . Unlike cigarette packs , cans of smokeless tobacco contain no warning labels . The product is not safe , however . Oral cancer is common among older snuff dippers , Dr. Hook says . As Dr. Hook notes , until ten years ago moist tobacco was rarely used by young people  --  it was then a relic of a bygone day . Along with its tremendously increased use among young people , we can expect to see a corresponding increase in oral cancer.59 U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has warned the public in strong terms about the hazards of dipping snuff . Dr. Vincent DeVita , director of the National Cancer Institute , expresses the same concern : " I 'd like to have the tobacco industry explain a couple of things about the business of chewing tobacco and dipping snuff . Something like 10 to 15 percent of oral cancers in this country are directly related to snuff dipping . They 're increasing that market , and I understand that some high-level tobacco official in one of the tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids chew tobacco and they get hooked on the nicotine , you 've got them forever . ' That means they 'll be hooked on nicotine and they more likely will smoke cigarettes after that . I 'd like to hear an explanation of how one could justify that . I 'd be very interested . " Recent data , for example , from our institute show that snuff dipping among populations in the South  --  where they have been doing this for a long time  --  is associated with such a very high incidence of cancers of the oral cavity and mouth . A relationship is unequivocal . We do have cancer- 60 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST July/August 1985 mortality maps , and the spots stand out on the map so brightly that we had to go down there and find out what was going on in the areas with the high incidence of oral-cavity cancer . We found out it was due to snuff dipping . I do n't understand how they can look us squarely in the eyes and tell us that we should have an open debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble gum so they can attract teenagers to chewing tobacco . I 'd like to be in a public debate and get an answer to that one . " A spokesman for U.S. Tobacco  --  who would not allow his name to be used  --  refused comment on the Marsee case but said , " Smokeless tobacco has not been scientifically established as a cause of any human disease . " His statement can be appreciated more for what it omits than for what it says . Tobacco companies make no assertion that Copenhagen or Skoal is safe , because numerous studies link moist tobacco with cancer . Such practitioners as Dr. Hook , who regularly see tumors develop right where tobacco has been in contact with the body , will find little satisfaction in debating abstract questions of scientific causation while young men like Sean Marsee die of oral cancer . if tobacco were covered by the same federal law that regulates other products ingested by humans , the evidence that exists would be more than enough to require the government to ban it . But tobacco is unique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last 100 years , tobacco is the one consumer product that , by federal law , can not be regulated by either the federal government or the states . Targeting Children The U.S. Tobacco spokesman mentioned previously insists that the company 's products were not marketed to young people . " We do not want people under 18 using our product , " he asserts . He said a smokeless-tobacco advertising code is intended to target males over 18 . ( Unlike cigarettes , smokeless tobacco may be advertised on television . ) Some people believe , however , that television advertising of Copenhagen and Skoal is aimed at children . John O'Dell , field associate in Ada for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes , befriended Sean just a few months before the boy died and now speaks out regularly about the dangers of dipping snuff . O'Dell says such professional athletes as Carlton Fisk , a catcher for the Chicago White Sox , and Walt Garrison , the former running back of the Dallas Cowboys , touting smokeless tobacco on TV had a deep effect on Sean as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assertion that moist-tobacco advertising is not aimed at children " is a bold-faced lie . " Smokers Sue The Marsee case is probably the only one in the country involving smokeless tobacco . However , numerous smokers or the next of kin of smokers have sued tobacco companies . In the past 20 years several of these cases have gone to trial . One plaintiff won a verdict , but the case was overturned on appeal , and the others lost at the trial level . The current crop of cases is more promising than ever before for a variety of reasons . The hazards of smoking are now beyond dispute to any reasonable person . More than 40,000 studies have shown smoking to be the No. 1 preventable cause of death in our society . In addition , nicotine is now known to cause a physical addiction . Cigarette smoking is now classified as a form of drug dependency by the World Health Organization and by the American Psychiatric Association . The National Institute on Drug Abuse considers smoking an addiction . When John Galbraith , a California insurance-company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard no talk of addiction , of course , or of lung cancer . Galbraith , a college graduate , prided himself on being well-informed . Galbraith was , says his wife , Elayne , " a very intelligent man about almost everything in life except smoking . He discussed everything else openly , but not smoking . " Galbraith was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1979 and died in 1982 . When he had come to believe that his fatal disease was caused by smoking , his attitude changed . Becoming reflective , he looked at his smoking the same cool way he had always regarded other issues . John finally admitted the truth smokers find so hard to face  --  smoking had not really been a matter of free choice for him . " 1 would n't be dying now if had n't been addicted to cigarettes , " he told Elayne . Galbraith , like millions of other Americans , had seen warnings on cigarette packs and advertising , but , like most , he did not appreciate the real dangers of smoking . Studies done for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people understand the most elementary facts about the health hazards of smoking . Most of us are not aware , for example , that 80 percent of lung cancer is caused by smoking . Even more shocking , lung cancer is almost always fatal . Fewer than 5 percent of its Sold a Bill of Goods The lawsuit meant a lot to John Galbraith ; as a result , it means a lot to Elayne now . " He begged me time and time again to follow through with the lawsuit , not to drop it , " she recounts . Elayne says . John 's attitude about the cigarette industry had gone through a major change in the year before his death . He was a conservative man  --  probusiness , his wife says . He had always trusted in the basic decency of business people , including those in cigarette companies . But as far as that industry was concerned , he found his trust had been misplaced . One day in the hcispital , Elayne recalls , John pointed out all the glossy advertisements for cigarettes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate how well-done the ads were , how convincing they were . The required health warnings were so cleverly disguised that most readers would miss them . Galbraith thought he had been taken in by ads just like these , that he 'd been sold a bill of goods . But he did n't want it to end there ; he wanted to warn others . Elayne Galbraith now finds it hard to believe that cigarette advertising is permitted . " They do n't have a right to advertise , " she says . " It 's as if we would allow heroin and cocaine to be advertised . Tobacco kills and is addictive . " Tearing a Life to Pieces Lawsuits , courtrooms and trials have always been fascinating . But the reality of being a plaintiff is not glamorous or exciting . It is often a harsh and painful experience . The tobacco lawsuits have a pronounced David-and-Goliath aspect . Elayne Galbraith is one individual pitted against some of the most powerful corporations in America . Though she is grateful to Belli and his young associate Paul Monzione for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 97 // New Hope For All Smokers Tobacco continued from page 61 she often must force herself to recall John 's wish that she continue the suit . Long before trial , she had to submit to depositions  --  informal court proceedings that allowed the defendants to hear the plaintiff 's point of view before the trial . Elayne 's first deposition lasted 15 hours ; the second , about 7 . The tobacco-company lawyers had done a great deal of homework . They asked Elayne about every conceivable aspect of John 's life that might be construed negatively  --  regardless of its relevance to his smoking and smoking-related cancer . John had been a gentleman and a devoted family man , but like most of us he had a few rocky places in his life . A business he had been involved with had failed , and he 'd been depressed . The tobacco-company lawyers wanted to know all about that angle . He 'd been married once before and divorced in 1941 . They wanted all the details of that marriage and actually went to another state to interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than 40 years before he died . Elayne Galbraith , normally a soft-spoken woman , is angry : " They took a good man 's life and tried to tear it to pieces . They will stop at nothing to 98 protect themselves . They do n't care that people are dying . . . . " The Issues on Trial When the Marsee case , the GalTHE // braith case and dozens of others around the country go to trial , the issues to be decided will probably be causation , the impact of tobacco marketing and advertising , and addiction . July/August 1985 Although every medical authority in the world believes that smoking is the No. 1 cause of lung cancer , lawyers for the tobacco industry will no doubt argue that no scientific proof of the relationship exists . The issue will have to be decided by a jury of laymen , not medical experts . The cancer-connection issue will be somewhat more difficult to argue in the Marsee case than in the smoking cases , for the evidence of the causal link between snuff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of tobacco advertising and marketing will be brought up in most of the lawsuits . Indeed , a law firm in Charleston , West Virginia , has named several advertising agencies that worked for cigarette companies as defendants in one suit . One of the plaintiffs ' attorneys , William Druckman , says , " We feel that they purposefully advertised a product that they knew was defective harmful and that they should be responsible along with the cigarette companies . " Other attorneys have decided not to sue the media , for tactical reasons . David Novack , a Newark , New Jersey , lawyer who represents several plaintiffs , says , " The law making cigarette manufacturers liable is very clear and favorable to plaintiffs ; the law holding the media responsible is much less favorable . " Finally , the importance of addiction can not be overestimated . The argument that smoking is a matter of free choice can be countered with the evidence that smoking addicts . Getting Organized Until recently no organization for attorneys litigating tobacco victims ' claims existed . But in January the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Headed by Richard Daynard , a professor at Northeastern University School of Law , and Michael Charney , a psychiatrist , this group has already developed an information network that will help attorneys trade information about tobacco litigation . The project will also work closely with Action on Smoking and Health , headed by the antismoking activist John F. Banzhaf III , a professor of law at George Washington University . Tobacco companies may soon begin to pay the bill for the millions of tobacco-related illnesses and deaths in the United States .
