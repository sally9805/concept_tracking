The Internal Revenue Code is 2,052 pages long . To create it took decades of late-night horse trading , millions of pages of expert testimony and billions of dollars in political contributions , often pledged after ( taxdeductible ) three-martini lunches . To understand it requires the services of a well- paid lawyer . To reform it demands a monumental effort of political will . <P> For Ronald Reagan , the consummate salesman , tax reform promises to be the hardest sell of his presidency . This week he will launch a ballyhooed campaign to convince Congress that political salvation lies in rebuffing the swarms of special interests whose loopholes now ventilate the tax code . His method of persuasion , as ever , will be to preach over the heads of Congressmen to the voters who elect them . <P> In a nationwide television address Tuesday night , Reagan will grandly present tax reform as the final battle of what he calls " the Second American Revolution , " his crusade to whittle down Big Government and spur opportunities for growth . He will hammer his message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a ceremony honoring the drafters of the Declaration of Independence , in Williamsburg , Va . <P> The package he will unveil , though already frayed by the persistent chafing of special interests , is still highly ambitious , at least when measured against the cautious norms of political reality . By closing or narrowing a raft of loopholes , it would simplify the tax code and allow reduced rates without loss of revenue to the Treasury . Most taxpayers would shell out less , the President will emphatically advertise , while businesses and the wealthy would be stripped of shelters that now reduce or even eliminate their tax burden . The top rate would drop from 50% to 35% ; middle-income taxpayers would pay 25% , and those with lower incomes 15% . The personal exemption for every taxpayer would nearly double , from $1,040 this year to $2,000 as early as 1986 . <P> By launching a high-visibility crusade for tax reform , Reagan hopes to regain his political momentum and divert attention from a series of setbacks that began with his trip to the grave sites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the House last week roundly rejected his compromise budget plan , restoring Social Security increases and cutting defense . Says one top aide : " If we did n't have a tax-reform project , we 'd need to create one , just to get the President out on the offensive . " <P> Indeed , winning the tax-reform battle would forever make mythic Reagan 's political touch . But if the rewards for the President are great , there are certainly risks . Losing could stamp him as a feckless lame duck . And at this point , failure is at least an even bet . <P> But either way , the long-term political benefits that could result from simply proposing a tax-reform plan are significant . By casting the Republicans as the party that defied the special interests for the benefit of the ordinary voter , Reagan hopes to re-establish the G.O.P. as the majority party for the first time in more than half a century . Optimistic Republican strategists believe they can finally rid the party of the country-club conservative label that has clung to it since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hands the weapon with which to forever dismantle the New Deal coalition , " exults New Right Strategist Richard Viguerie.
