 | Even after a year 's healing , her face told the story . It was a boxer 's face ? the nose flattened , the left eye distorted , the upper lip still showing signs of a cleft so severe that nearby tissue was used to fill it . Thirteen months had passed since Hedda Nussbaum was arrested along with her lover , Joel Steinberg , for the death of their six-year-old adopted daughter , Lisa . During that time no one was certain that Nussbaum would ever be fit to testify against the man accused of striking the blows that killed the little girl . When she finally took the stand.in a New York court last week , the noisy room fell silent . In a halting voice that mesmerized the jury , the spectators and millions watching on live television , Nussbaum told her story . It was a chilling tale of drug abuse , systematic beatings and a life of squalor hidden behind a middle-class facade . It was a story of Nussbaum 's almost total devotion to a man who stripped her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended with the image of a helpless and innocent child , lying comatose on a bathroom floor while her parents ignored her and freebased cocaine . Nussbaum might have saved Lisa with a phone call . But she did n't for fear of angering the man she loved , the man who left her with the fighter 's face . The Steinberg case has focused national attention on the problems of child abuse and family violence , which occurs in 25 percent of all marriages . How had Steinberg and Nussbaum " adopted " Lisa and 16-month-old Mitchell without going through proper agencies ? Why had n't more teachers noticed Lisa 's bruises and unkempt appearance and done something about it ? Why had n't city agencies , which more than once were notified of possible abuse in the Steinberg home , pursued the case ? In short , why had the system failed ? There was another question ? one that Nussbaum 's injuries and the chaotic condition of the couple 's bloodstained apartment only hinted at . Why was a battered woman powerless to escape ? even when her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered some answers to the last question . Her description of how Steinberg used drugs , mind control and an escalating pattern of violence to isolate and control her opened a window to the psychology of violent relationships ( page 65 ) . Her tale was so riveting that all three New York network TV stations pre-empted their schedules to  | broadcast her testimony live . The Steinberg trial , which began as a case study of child abuse , has emerged as a frightening symbol of another form of family violence as well . " It 's absolutely the worst case of wife-battering I 've ever seen , " says Dr. Samuel Klagsbrun , the executive medical director of Four Winds Hospital in Westchester County , N.Y. , where Nussbaum has been living since March . " She was a slave , totally submissive to this man , with no ability or will to save her own daughter . " Prosecutors agreed : in October all charges against Nussbaum were dropped , on the ground that she was physically and emotionally incapable either of harming Lisa or coming to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their client beat his lover , deny that he abused or killed Lisa . In their opening statement , the defense called the case against Steinberg " circumstantial " ( Nussbaum does not claim to have seen the beating ) and characterized Nussbaum 's allegations as " inconsistent , delusional , and unreliable . " More recently , the defense has suggested a " pecking order " in which Steinberg beat Nussbaum , and she battered Lisa , perhaps out of jealousy . Last week 's confrontation was high drama . The two former lovers had not seen each other since their arrest ; as Nussbaum entered the courtroom , Steinberg , 47 , leaned forward while Nussbaum looked away . She continued to avert her eyes as she took the witness stand , focusing instead on the district attorney . Finally , the lawyer asked Nussbaum to identify the defendant . Turning toward the man who had once held a Svengali-like control over her , Nussbaum raised her arm . " That 's him , " she said , revealing no emotion . " Wearing a gray jacket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed account of the bizarre events that led to Lisa 's tragic death . Nussbaum testified that on Nov. 1 , 1987 , Steinberg slept until early afternoon . Lisa and Mitchell , the other child the couple was raising , were hungry . ( Mitchell , who was not harmed , is now named Travis and is living with his mother , Nicole Smigiel , on Long Island . ) Nussbaum , who said she had n't slept the night before , cooked some vegetables in the kitchen . After lunch Steinberg asked whether she and Lisa had " drunk enough water that day . " Steinberg believed drinking large amounts of water was healthy , Nussbaum explained , and frequently questioned her about their intake . When Nussbaum said they had not drunk any water , Steinberg made them eat some hot pepper . " We then drank several glasses of water , " Nussbaum said . Steinberg began to dress to go to a restaurant for a business appointment . Lisa , who treasured accompanying her father on such excursions , was worried that he was still angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Daddy 's going to take me with him tonight ? " Lisa asked . Nussbaum said she told the girl to ask him herself , then went into the bathroom . ' What happened ? ' Minutes later , according to Nussbaum , Steinberg came into the bathroom holding Lisa in his outstretched arms . " She was lying in his arms , limp , " Nussbaum said . " And I said , What happened ? ' He said , What 's the difference what happened ? This is your child . Has n't this gone far enough ? " ' Nussbaum later explained that Steinberg said he was angry  | at Lisa for staring at him . " He said , I knocked her down and she did n't want to get up again . This staring business had gotten to be too much ' . " Steinberg put Lisa on the bathroom floor and got ready to go out . While Nussbaum attempted to revive her daughter , Steinberg told Nussbaum to " relax , go with her . Stay in harmony with her . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . " He always wanted us to be on the same wavelength . " Then Steinberg left for dinner , promising to take care of Lisa when he got back . " ' Do n't worry , just let her sleep ' , " Nussbaum said Steinberg told her . " I will get her up when I get back ' . " He did not return for three hours . Even though the girl remained unconscious , with water and undigested food oozing out of her mouth , Nussbaum did little more than ineffectually pump the girl 's chest and occasionally check her pulse . When asked to explain why she did not call an ambulance when Lisa lay comatose and dying on her bathroom floor , Nussbaum said she believed Steinberg had " healing powers . " Then she momentarily lost her composure , choking back tears . " I looked at the phone and I started thinking , Should I call 911 or . . . a pediatrician ? ' And I said , No , Joel said he would take care of her . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrust for him . So I did n't call . " Lisa died three days later . Doctors testified that she could have survived had she received prompt medical attention . Battered women : After weeks of testimony about Lisa 's injuries , attention turned to the dynamics of the perverse relationship between the two adults allegedly responsible for her death . Psychologists say the circumstances of the Steinberg case are by no means unique . Though it 's true that most battered women finally leave the abuser when the violence involves a child , that may not be the case if the abuse starts before the children arrive . " Things might have been different if the kids had been brought on the scene earlier , " says Dr. Penelope Grace , a specialist in family violence at Children 's Hospital in Boston . When the battering precedes the children , it is more difficult for the abused spouse to leave . Nussbaum testified that Steinberg started beating her three years before the couple " adopted " Lisa . ( The girl 's natural mother , Michele Launders ? who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the child . Instead , he kept her . ) One of the more puzzling aspects of Nussbaum 's testimony supports the notion that a battered woman can harbor tenderness toward a child while simultaneously neglecting her . During her inadequate efforts to save Lisa , Nussbaum removed and washed the girl 's soiled underpants , and @#  | wrapped her in a blanket . When Mitchell woke up in the midst of the crisis , Nussbaum tried to keep him from seeing Lisa , fearing he would hurt her or become upset seeing her condition . Nussbaum also said that during the hours Lisa lay comatose , she consulted medical dictionaries in an effort to find out what was wrong with her . Yet she smoked cocaine with Steinberg after he returned and did n't call for help until Steinberg told her to at 6:30 a.m . By then Lisa had stopped breathing . Later Nussbaum seemed baffled when asked why Mitchell slept in his playpen . It had not occurred to her to make room for a crib . In the courtroom , Mitchell 's biological grandmother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly susceptible to the influence of a domineering man . The daughter of immigrants , she was a shy child with an intense fear of being abandoned . NEWSWEEK obtained a copy of a letter purportedly written by Nussbaum approximately 10 years ago . Nussbaum writes that her mother , when pregnant with her , had wanted an abortion . The letter highlights the writer 's lack of selfconfidence . " My mother in- sisted on doing everything for me ? putting on my socks at age 6 for example ... My father , on the other hand , was always saying , Listen to me . I 'm older . I know better . ' The combination made me feel like I could n't do anything for myself and did n't know anything .... I just went where I was taken . " In last week 's testimony , Nussbaum said she quickly fell in love with Steinberg , who was a gregarious criminal lawyer when she met him in 1975 . " I loved to listen to him talk , " she said . " Basically , I worshiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever met . I believed he had supernatural . godlike power . " At first Steinberg encouraged his new friend to be more assertive at her job as a children 's book editor at Random House . " He persuaded me to ask for promotions and raises . I did n't have much self confidence . " Nussbaum says she did n't realize then that Steinberg was playing a calculated game of mind control . " He was giving me mixed signals , " she testified . " He would praise me and build my ego . On the other hand , he was constantly critical . And he would strike me . " Ruptured spleen : Steinberg allegedly landed the first serious blow in 1978 , two years after Nussbaum moved into his apartment in Greenwich Village . Nussbaum said Steinberg hit her in the eye hard enough to cause her to " see light . " She went to the hospital ? by bus and alone . At first , said Nussbaum , she told the doctor the truth , but later asked the physician to erase the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect Joel from any legal repercussions , " Nussbaum said in court . When she got home , Steinberg was " very affectionate . " Three years later , she testified , he hit Nussbaum so hard that she had to go to the hospital again ? this time with a ruptured spleen that was subsequently removed . Over the next six years , Nussbaum says Steinberg broke her knee , broke her  | ribs , choked her hard enough to damage her vocal cords , burned her body with a propane torch , hit her hands , feet and sexual organs with a broomstick , urinated on her , forced her to sleep while handcuffed to a chinning bar , knocked out teeth , hit her head against a wall , beat her with a metal exercise bar , pulled her hair out and poked his fingers in her eyes . Nussbaum also said she was frequently forced to take cold baths ( both as punishment and to reduce swelling ) and often slept in the bathtub or on the floor . Phone control : The psychological abuse Nussbaum described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often that she frequently stayed away from work and eventually lost her job , cutting her off from a source of friendship and selfesteem . Once , when Nussbaum tried to do some free-lance editing at home , Steinberg ripped up her papers and threw them out the window . By 1984 Nussbaum 's physical appearance had so degenerated that she spent most of her time inside their cluttered three-room apartment , shared now with Lisa , who slept on the living-room couch . Steinberg , she says , even cut her off from her family . In 1983 " Joel told my mother never to come back . He said she was a bad influence and upset Lisa and called her a liar and a bad person . " Nussbaum says Steinberg called her sister , Judith Liebman , " a whore " and an " evil person " who was " dangerous to us . " He also forbade Nussbaum to talk to her family on the phone when he was out of the house . If anyone called while she was home alone , she was expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced me they were all dangerous to me and would say buzzwords that would put me in a trance through posthypnotic suggestion . " When Nussbaum did talk on the phone , Steinberg would make suggestions about what to say , sometimes loud enough for the other party to hear . " We had a speakerphone , and it was always on , " explained Nussbaum . Psychiatrist Klagsbrun says Nussbaum 's gradual acceptance of Steinberg as a godlike figure follows an established pattern . " People wonder how someone can tolerate such a situation and not walk out , " he says . " It 's like what happens to someone in a concentration camp . They are reduced , by virtue of physical torture , to a mere existence level . They shut off normal human emotions . " In fact , Nussbaum started to leave on several occasions . Once , she got all the way to La Guardia Airport , with enough money in her pocket to buy a ticket . She ended up calling Steinberg from the airport and , like a child who has run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house in Connecticut and a women 's shelter in New York ended the same way . When she went to a hospital , Nussbaum invariably lied about the source of her injuries , saying she fell downstairs or was attacked by men in the street . Several doctors , neighbors and teachers spotted telltale evidence of beatings in both Nussbaum and Lisa . Some even filed reports to social-service agencies . Last month a teacher at Lisa 's school testified that she noticed the girl 's black eye and bruises and told her superiors she suspected child abuse . But there was no follow-up . On another occasion , neighbors called police to the Steinberg apartment . When patrolmen arrived , Steinberg and Nussbaum evidently convinced them that there was no trouble . Personality disorders : In crossexamination this week , Steinberg 's lawyers are certain to attack Nussbaum 's credibility . Her greatest vulnerability stems from her failure to summon help during the three hours she was alone with her comatose child . The prosecution 's contention that she was psychologically incapable of getting aid could be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorneys have reportedly prepared 500 pages of psychological examinations that contend Nussbaum suffers variously from passive dependent personality traits , depression , anxiety , psychotic disorders and infantile narcissistic tendencies . Defense lawyers will also likely claim that a $3 million civil suit Nussbaum recently filed against Steinberg gives her a financial stake in the trial 's outcome . " The case is Hedda , " argues defense attorney Ira London . " If Hedda is credible ... and she indicates to the jury that Joel battered Lisa then that is the case . If on the other hand it becomes clear there are other scenarios , other possibilities , then he should be found not guilty . " There is always a chance that Nussbaum will break down on the stand under the pressure of an intense crossexamination . Steinberg 's lawyers , however , may not want to risk attacking Nussbaum , who so far has come across as a sympathetic witness . Though her demeanor on the stand appeared fragile at times , her ability to testify against the man who had once so completely dominated her spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klagsbrun , is the most important aspect of the case : if other battered women see that the cycle of abuse and dependence can be broken , maybe the next Lisa Steinberg will be saved .
