Prophecies of the last days surface as a campaign issue <P> For they are demonic spirits . . . who go abroad to the kings of the whole world , to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty . . . at the place which is called in Hebrew Armageddon . . . <P> - Revelation 16:14,16 <P> In one of the most peculiar twists of the 1984 campaign , St. John 's apocalyptic vision of the " End Times " emerged last week as a political issue . During the final presidential debate , Panelist Marvin Kalb of NBC asked Ronald Reagan , " Do you feel that we are now heading , perhaps , for some kind of nuclear Armageddon ? " While Nancy Reagan gasped , " Oh , no ! " to companions , the President answered that , yes , he had chatted with people about " the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon and so forth , and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that portend that . " But , he added soothingly , " no one knows whether those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow . So I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon . " <P> Despite that disclaimer , Reagan 's critics wonder whether the President 's apparent belief in a particular biblical scenario for the end of the world means that he might consider nuclear war a divine instrument . Accordingly , more than 100 religious figures , many from the antinuclear left ( among them the Rev. William Sloane Coffin and Pacifist Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Gumbleton ) , held a Washington press conference last week to declare it " profoundly disturbing " that high political leaders " might identify with extremists who believe that nuclear war is inevitable and imminent . " They also attacked the religious right for supposedly believing " that reconciliation with America 's adversaries is ultimately futile . " The statement was orchestrated by the Christie Institute , a liberal research and action agency , which drew on some enterprising research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private utterances by Reagan on the possible imminence of Armageddon . <P> One of the unnamed but presumed targets of the Christie Institute , Moral Majority Founder Jerry Falwell , dismissed the charges as " a thinly veiled attack on Ronald Reagan by liberal clergymen who have thus far found him invulnerable . " Falwell said that he repudiated any " extremist world view which demands a nuclear Armageddon . " <P> Most Christian churches teach that the end of history will be marked by Christ 's return to earth to establish a perfect kingdom . A number of Old and New Testament passages describe the prelude to this event in terms of angelic battle and earthly turmoil . One of these vivid prophecies , the only one that names Armageddon , * is Revelation 16 . Most scholars believe that Revelation and other prophecies refer to such epochal events as Jesus ' death and resurrection and the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in A.D. 70 . Others see them as symbolic depictions of the spiritual struggle between good and evil . Liberal theologians tend to discount them altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
