Fourteen years after Federal Judge Arthur Garrity ordered crosstown busing to desegregate Boston 's public schools , the city is embarking on another overhaul of its troubled educational system . Last week local experts hired by Mayor Ray Flynn proposed a new approach , called controlled choice , that seeks to foster competition while maintaining the painfully achieved racial balance . Next fall schools through Grade 8 would be divided among three equally funded zones , with 14,000 students apiece . Within each zone , parents would be allowed to choose a particular school for their child , and pupils would be assigned to available spots in a way that preserved each school 's racial balance . Facilities that failed to attract enough students would be phased out . Says the plan 's co-author , Charles Willie of Harvard : " We 've learned that the emphasis has to be on education rather than mixing and matching students . "
