NEW YORK  --  CBS Inc. shares plunged $9. 375 to $98. 25 yesterday amid reports that investor Ivan F. Boesky had begun to sell part of his 8. 7% stake in the broadcasting , publishing and records company . The shares could fall further if investors who had been speculating on a CBS takeover sell more shares . If investors focus on the company ' s earnings prospects rather than its takeover potential , traders and analysts say , CBS shares soon could settle at $90 to $95 each . The drop in CBS stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading followed a lawsuit filed by CBS in federal district court here against Mr. Boesky late Tuesday . CBS charged that Mr. Boesky had violated securities laws and illegally financed his $247. 1 million investment in CBS shares by borrowing 100% of the purchase price of some of the stock . Stephen Fraidin , a lawyer for Mr. Boesky , said yesterday that the CBS suit was " without merit " and that Mr. Boesky hadn ' t financed his purchases improperly . Mr. Fraidin declined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Boesky couldn ' t be reached for comment . In yesterday ' s trading , 817 , 400 CBS shares traded , substantially more than have changed hands on average days recently . Several traders said there were indications that Mr. Boesky , acting through intermediaries , was liquidating part of his CBS position in response to the lawsuit . " CBS ' s strategy seems to be succeeding , " said one stock speculator who said he wasn ' t investing in CBS . " We have reliable reports that Boesky intermediaries are disposing of the stock . " Other traders said selling may have come from investors who had followed Mr. Boesky and from investors who had placed " stop loss " orders triggering automatic sales as share prices fell . Mr. Boesky disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week that he paid an average of $95. 50 a share to acquire his CBS block . If the stock price continues to drop , he would need to sell shares to avoid a loss , traders said . He also may be facing pressure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEC filing that an unspecified portion of his CBS block was financed through borrowing . In its lawsuit , CBS alleged that Mr. Boesky used some of his CBS stock as collateral for loans to buy more shares and said that a decline in the stock could force him to liquidate some of his shares to provide further security , triggering a " downward spiral " in the price of CBS stock . But traders indicated there wasn ' t any evidence of this in the market yesterday . A stock speculator said there were signs that Mr. Boesky was selling shares in ITT Corp . , Sperry Corp . , InterNorth Inc . , Unocal Corp. and other companies yesterday . Such sales might have helped him shore up his CBS position . A CBS spokesman attributed the stock drop to investor reaction to the suit against Mr. Boesky . Federal securities laws require Mr. Boesky to " promptly " disclose changes in his CBS position of 1% or more of the company ' s 29. 7 million common shares outstanding . Securities lawyers say that while the law doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such reports usually are filed within a few days . Analysts say that , based on their estimates of CBS earnings for this year and for 1986 , the stock should be trading between $90 and $95 a share . CBS shares have climbed since the March 18 announcement of Capital Cities Communications Inc. ' s agreement to acquire American Broadcasting Cos . Immediately before that announcement , CBS closed at $88. 50 , and it has risen as high as $114 on rumors that CBS might be a takeover candidate . Analysts value CBS assets at $175 to $200 a share . And they estimate that 1985 CBS earnings will improve only slightly over 1984 profit from continuing operations of $244. 9 million , or $8. 24 a share , because of dilution from last year ' s $362. 5 purchase of 12 magazines from Ziff Corp. and from the purchase of an interest in a cable-television programming concern . Joseph Fuchs , a broadcast analyst at Kidder , Peabody &; Co. , estimates that CBS profit from operations , will be $9. 40 a share in 1985 and $10. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts say , CBS will post per-share profit of $8. 40 in 1985 and $9. 50 in 1986 .
