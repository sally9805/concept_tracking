" Nauseating , " said Defense Department Spokesman Michael Burch . He was talking about a long list of alleged billing abuses by General Dynamics , the nation 's largest military contractor , with $7.2 billion in Pentagon business in 1984 . According to testimony before the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , the company billed the Government for an $18,000 country-club admissions fee , $1,125 worth of jewelry given to then Admiral Hyman Rickover 's wife and the charge for boarding a company executive 's dog at a kennel . Last week Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger suspended payments of roughly $40 million to General Dynamics for at least 30 days while the Pentagon investigates whether the company has bilked the taxpayers by billing the U.S. for corporate entertainment , personal expenses and political contributions . <P> The suspended payments represent less than 10% of General Dynamics ' monthly billings to the Defense Department and a piddling amount by Pentagon standards . Weinberger was adamant , however , in describing the move not simply as a public relations gesture but a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a speech to an American Legion gathering in Washington , Weinberger announced that the Pentagon 's auditors would conduct a general review of billing procedures and claims for overhead expenses by all major military contractors . The Defense Secretary added that he had asked the Justice Department to examine possible criminal violations by General Dynamics executives . <P> Defense Department auditors are also looking at Boeing Co. for billing a reported $127,000 of political contributions in 1982 . While the aerospace company has already withdrawn reimbursement requests for some of its donations , it stands by some $65,000 in political expenses . Meanwhile , General Dynamics , which makes the F-16 fighter , the Trident submarine and Tomahawk cruise missiles , pledged to " satisfy the Defense Department 's concerns regarding the validity of its billing procedure . " <P> Congressional skeptics suggest that Weinberger 's policy is a further bit of bluster in his effort to win approval from Congress of $277.5 billion in fiscal 1986 defense spending , a $31 billion increase over the current budget . The Pentagon suspended payments to Hughes Aircraft last year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . Said Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire , a veteran critic of the Pentagon : " It 's a beginning . But if this is all there is to it , it 's not going to be enough . "
