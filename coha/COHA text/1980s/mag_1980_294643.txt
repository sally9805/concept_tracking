How a comic made a comeback from nowhere <P> When he was a child and lost his parents at the beach , he asked a policeman , " Do you think we 'll ever find them ? " " I do n't know , " came the reply . " There 's so many places they could hide . " <P> No breaks , no how , no way . His father worked in a bank and got caught stealing pens . Research reveals that Rodney Dangerfield is the sap in his own family tree . The line has never been broken . Elevator operators eye him and always say the same thing : " Basement ? " On a night out in a Chinese restaurant , he opens his fortune cookie and gets the check from the next table . The trauma reaches into the intimate parts of his life . He has become such a maladroit lover that he caught a peeping Tom booing him . His wife " cut me down to once a month . I 'm lucky . Two guys I know she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life are run-on reminders of his inferiority . No luck . No chance . And of course-as a connoisseur of the hairsbreadth art of stand-up comedy will tell you-no respect . These components of Rodney Dangerfield 's fractured comic mask form one of the unlikeliest success stories around . Dangerfield was a has-been even before he was anyone at all . " I dropped out of show business once , " he often confesses in his act . " But nobody noticed . " <P> He went into business selling paint , and scribbled jokes between appointments . By the time most businessmen are playing chicken with their first heart attack , Rodney was planning his comeback from nowhere . At 45 , he made his first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show . He was 47 when he went on Carson for the first of 63 appearances . Now , at 58 , Dangerfield has a rambunctious new comedy album out and his first starring role in a Hollywood movie . <P> In Caddyshack , Rodney shows up as a real estate developer who dresses in color combinations out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local country club with such reflections as , " You look at that kid , you know why tigers eat their young . " Rodney must compete for attention in the film with alumni of Saturday Night Live and one mechanical gopher . He draws more laughs than the TV kids and chews up at least as much of the screen as the rodent . <P> Dangerfield , who keeps his traveling to a minimum and works as much as possible out of his own club on Manhattan 's East Side , has put together one of the best comedy acts in the trade by dealing shamelessly in things other comics struggle to hide-like fear , anger and humiliation . In performance , Dangerfield is the enemy of poise . A minute after he hits the lights , his brow throws off sweat like a lawn sprinkler . His eyes bulge . His hands claw at his throat . He may be trying to loosen his tie , but it looks as if he is trying to strangle himself . The whole performance is a screwball incarnation of the comedian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing out , when every joke falls like a barbell and the only laughs come when you introduce the band . Other guys fight their way past flop sweat , or cool it out . For Rodney Dangerfield , cool is a dial on a Fedders . He sets fear on parade , and all its consequences are his best punch lines .
