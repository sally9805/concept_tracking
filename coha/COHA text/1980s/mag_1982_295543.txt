Out of Lebanon 's agony , some prospects for peace <P> The traumatic events in Lebanon have changed the shape of politics , diplomacy and geography in the Middle East . TIME Chief of Correspondents Richard Duncan , Washington Bureau Chief Robert Ajemian , Associate Editor Henry Muller and Correspondent Harry Kelly last week ended a tour of the region . From their interviews with Israelis , Lebanese and Palestinians , they concluded that the opportunities for progress toward peace are brighter than they have been in years . Their assessment : <P> The most urgent task , in the view of nearly everyone , is the withdrawal of all foreign armies from Lebanon . Many of the officials interviewed expressed confidence that an agreement could be reached before the end of the year . The Syrians , who have had an army in Lebanon since 1976 , appear willing to accept their own withdrawal as the price for the pullout of Israeli forces , which are poised only about 20 miles from the Syrian capital of Damascus .

The main difficulty is Israel 's demand that 5,000 to 6,000 P.L.O . fighters who remain in northern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley leave at the same time . <P> If all foreign forces withdraw from Lebanon , the question will then be whether the new government of Amin Gemayel , who was elected only two weeks ago , can effectively reconcile the Christian and Muslim communities that have been at odds since the beginning of the civil war in 1975 .

While Bashir attempted to impose Christian supremacy in Lebanon , Amin remained in touch with the country 's other religious communities .

The Begin government , which helped train Bashir Gemayel 's militia , was badgering the late President-elect only a few weeks ago for important concessions , including a peace treaty with Israel . After one meeting in which Begin repeatedly addressed Bashir , 34 , as " young man , " an insult in the Middle East , Bashir returned to Beirut protesting that " they wo n't let me have my dignity . " Amin does not share his brother 's fondness for Israel , and the Begin government is determined to treat him with more consideration . Officials say that they will not insist on a peace treaty , and concede that the best guarantee of security along Israel 's northern border is a peaceful , united Lebanon .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
