TIME Correspondent John Borrell was finishing his dinner around midnight in the luxurious Summerland hotel just south of Beirut when a large , bedraggled group arrived for a late supper . Borrell did a double take : here were 32 hostages who had been roused from their beds Friday night for what was intended to be a farewell meal . Borrell , the only reporter in the restaurant when the hostages arrived , sent this account : <P> They sat at four tables next to where I was draining the dregs of a coffee cup . Aware that I might be thrown out if the guards decided I was a journalist , I remained silent as the hostages took in their surroundings  --  a blue pool sparkling with underwater lighting , deck chairs drawn up in regiments and a moon rising over the Mediterranean . <P> One of the hostages leaned over and whispered , " You speak French ? " " No , English , " I replied . " What are you doing here ? " he whispered , looking around furtively . " You a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> For several minutes we talked surreptitiously , trying to appear nonchalant whenever one of the guards seemed to be watching . An ABC television crew staying in the hotel was shooed off and told to come back when the food had been served . <P> Shish kebabs and steaks arrived quickly , along with watermelon and cans of Pepsi-Cola . " This is not our normal fare , " muttered Tom Cullins of Vermont . Said another : " We lived on bread and water our first five days . " There was a chorus of dissent . " Come off it , " said a hostage , " it was better than that . " The main complaint : their captors continually woke them up at ungodly hours to discuss the situation . <P> " Can you post this letter to my wife ? " asked Cullins . He slipped it to me unobserved . <P> " Reagan was right when he called these guys a bunch of thugs , " one hostage whispered . " But he was stupid to say it when he did . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American citizens are being held hostage ? " <P> As dinner was served , the TV crew began filming . " It 's a bloody circus , all this television stuff , " complained Peter Hill from Illinois . " We are just serving their ends , and we wonder sometimes what it is all about . " Another hostage whispered : " Maybe ABC had us hijacked to improve their ratings . " <P> Later the hotel chefs produced a cake with white-chocolate icing . On it in thin dark chocolate lettering : WISHING YOU ALL A HAPPY TRIP HOME . <P> " Maybe it 's a farewell supper  --  you 'll see soon enough , " one guard told his prisoners . As the group was departing , the hotel staff handed out orange roses . " I want you guys to know that sometimes in life you have to take time out to smell the roses , " said Hostage Jerome Barczak as he sniffed his .
