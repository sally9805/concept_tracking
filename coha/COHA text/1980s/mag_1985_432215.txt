 | A mericans love Japanese cars . That 's no secret . But a decade ago the big attractions of Toyotas , Datsuns ( now Nissans ) , and Hondas were fuel efficiency and low price . Today , there are fuel-efficient American cars , too . And where Japan 's car labels were once riveted to the most inexpensive entry-level cars , they are now affixed to more-expensive models like Corolla , Stanza , and Accord . These sedans sell in the $9,000 to $12,000 range , double the price buyers were paying for Japanese cars just a few years ago . If it is n't just fuel efficiency and low price , what is it about these cars that keeps American buyers coming back to Japanese-car showrooms ? To find out , we chose four outstanding examples of this changing auto picture ? Chevrolet Nova CL , Honda Accord SE-i , Nissan Stanza , and Toyota Corolla LE ? for a head-to-head instrumented track test . There 's plenty of common ground among the four cars . All the cars are front-drives and use transversely mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all combine excellent fuel economy with good performance . Five passengers is the nominal limit , but four is more acceptable , especially on long trips . We paid special attention to the Nova and Corolla because their design is essentially the same , but they 're built in different countries by different companies . The Nova is the product of a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota . It 's assembled in Fremont , Calif. , and uses a drive train and other components shipped fully assembled from Toyota in Japan . Corolla is the low-priced compact sedan in Toyota 's lineup , with the same engine , belly pan , and suspension bits as the Nova . The most important difference between the two vehicles was - the transmission . The Nova had a fivespeed manual ; the Corolla , a fourspeed automatic . Acceleration tests with our computerized Lamar fifth wheel provided data that helped us see important differences between the four similarappearing vehicles . The manual transmission gave the Nova a two-second 22 POPULAR SCIENCE @# advantage over the Corolla in zeroto-60-mph acceleration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accord posted an average time of 12.1 seconds from zero to 60 . The Accord 's exceptional quiet and the smoothness of its engine and transmission belied how quickly the car was actually accelerating . But the real surprise was the Stanza , posting a terrific 10.7-second average after two runs to 60 mph . That is one of the best sedan averages we 've ever recorded , regardless of engine size or car price . Stanza 's secret is low chassis weight ( 2,300 pounds ) and the biggest engine in the group ( 120 cu . in . ) . Each of the four cars received an excellent grade in the high-speed handling and low-speed maneuverability tests . These dynamic trials challenge steering and suspension systems . The results indicate that the cars not only maneuver well in low-speed traffic , but are also outstanding at avoiding obstacles at highway speeds . The low chassis weights and independent rear suspensions of the sedans share the credit for their sterling performance . Note that all of these relatively small cars come with power steering , a feature rarely found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers and dealers no longer think of these cars as stripped , bottomof-the-line products . The subcompact Honda is the most obvious example of this new perspective . Strangely , the Honda 's power-assisted steering was the lightest of the four vehicles tested ? perhaps too light . Much of the road feel that 's important to a driver 's decision-making on wet and icy roads is gone . This could be a critical problem if the operator is not aware that the car is losing traction because of a lack of steering feedback . One obvious improvement in all four cars is a reduced interior noise level . Passenger-compartment decibel readings are lower than those recorded in similar cars just a few years ago . Almost absent are the high-rev whine and vibration of the small-displacement engines , rebound booming and squeaks from lightweight suspensions , and high-frequency wind noise at highway speeds . Chevrolet Nova CL Nova may be American-built , but every bolt , rubber grommet , and gasket looks and works like a Toyota 's . And that 's good . Fit and finish are excellent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for just-right comfort . Extra storage pockets are accessible and plentiful . And , as with most Japanese cars , the trunk and fuel-filler door can be opened by flicking a remote lever under the driver 's seat . The power train supplied by Toyota is smooth and quiet . The low-effort clutch mechanism and the 2,800-rpm torque peak make the Nova fun to drive , even in slow-moving traffic . On the highway , the 0.73 overdrive fifth gear and 3.72 axle ratio help keep engine revs low for quiet , vibrationfree cruising . Nova 's ride is surprisingly smooth for a compact sedan . There 's plenty of wheel travel built into the front and rear MacPherson strut suspensions ? even the deepest ruts are comfortably absorbed . A minor glitch is the generous amount of body roll , a serious problem only during hard maneu-@# vers . ( For more on the Chevrolet Nova . see PS , July . ) Honda Accord SE-i The Accord had the highest sticker price and the lowest interior volume of the four cars tested . According to the EPA , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , we immediately felt the difference . Rearseat passengers will find leg and knee room tight , bordering on the uncomfortable . Even front passengers in the SE-i 's standard leather seats noticed a lack of stretch-out space . Accord has been known as an outstanding example of high-quality Japanese automobile construction . Our firsthand observations with this car and other U.S.-built Accords IPS , Nov ' 83 confirm that Honda has maintained its quality standards in American assembly plants . Nissan Stanza We do n't care what the specs say . Stanza somehow seems roomier inside . Its ride is smoother than the competition 's , as well . We 've already mentioned the car 's outstanding acceleration . Put these three important factors together and you have a better way to travel .  | It 's too bad our brake test gave the Stanza a black eye . Its 213-foot hot stopping distance was the longest we 've recorded in some time . The problem is brake fade . Subjected to multiple stops , as you might encounter on a long descent in mountain terrain , the brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping distances stretch . Toyota Corolla LE The only real differences between Corolla and Nova are the cabinwindow arrangements , the rear seat 's fold-down backrest in the Corolla , and the large GM radio smoothly integrated into the Nova 's instrument panel . Fuel economy for the automatictransmission Corolla and the manualtransmission Nova is nearly the same . That 's because the Toyota automatic has an overdrive gear engaged by pushing a button on top of the shift lever . Unfortunately , according to our fifth wheel , automatic-equipped models sacrifice a significant amount of acceleration . Conclusion : Nova and Corolla are virtually identical cars . They deliver reliable , fuel-efficient transport , with a wide variety of convenience features as standard equipment , at an affordable price . How do you decide which car is best for you ? We think it depends on whether you like your local Chevrolet or Toyota dealer better . CHEVROLET NOVA CL @# Our picks I 'd like to choose the Stanza . The price is reasonable , engine performance is terrific , and the interior is friendly for the driver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's either the Nova or the Corolla. ? J. D. Give me the Nova . The number of @# Chevy and Toyota dealers ( both possible parts sources ) across the countpractically ensures good service and parts availability . The smooth rid , vibration-free engine , and sweet - shifting transmission are icing on the cake . Why pick the Nova over the Corolla ? The hardware under the sheet . metal is the same , but I like Nova 's shape better .
