James Huberty , who shot 21 people to death at a McDonald ' s restaurant in San Ysidro , Calif. , in July , had previously been able to find work as a security guard // Kenneth Bianchi , who confessed to five of the 10 " Hillside Strangler " murders in Los Angeles in the late 1970 ' s , was not only able to get a job as a security guard , but was also regarded by police officials in Bellingham , Wash. , as a good prospect for law-enforcement work. // If these examples are any measure , American society is not very good at recognizing potential multiple murderers - neither mass murderers like Mr. Huberty who kill groups of people in a single outburst nor serial murderers who kill many victims over a long period. // Indeed , criminologists , psychiatrists and law-enforcement officials say that research into the psychology and behavior of the multiple murderer is only in its infancy and that , in the words of one scholar , " the mass killer can not be predicted. " // Yet , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are confirming some preconceptions and confounding others. // Two Northeastern University professors , Dr. James Alan Fox , who teaches criminal justice , and Dr. Jack Levin , a sociologist , have written one of the few general studies of the topic , " Mass Murder : America ' s Growing Menace , " to be published early next year. // <> <> F.B.I. Data Studied // They studied data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on murders in the United States from 1976 to 1980 and found 156 episodes in which four or more people were slain . They also reviewed psychiatric reports and newspaper clippings and interviewed principals in 42 serial or mass murders that occurred from 1974 to 1979. // Among their findings were these : // // - New York State leads the country in the number of mass murders . From 1976 to 1980 the state had 30 multiple murders , while California had 21 and Texas 15. // // - Multiple murderers are almost exclusively men . Only 10 of the 156 multiple murderers culled from F.B.I. computer data were women. // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white people . Although 50 percent of single-victim murders in the country are committed by blacks , Dr. Fox said , only 22 percent of the multiple murders were committed by blacks. // - Multiple murderers are older than the average murderer . While most people convicted of murder are in their teens or 20 ' s , multiple murderers tend to be in their 30 ' s. // // - Like most killers , multiple murderers generally kill people they know , out of rage or frustration , or the misguided fit of jealousy that the police said characterized Christopher Thomas , the man charged with murdering 10 women and children in Brooklyn last April . Murderers like Mr. Huberty or Charles J. Whitman , who shot 14 people at random from atop a tower at the University of Texas in Austin in 1966 , are the exceptions. // // - Some serial murderers roam from state to state searching for victims , but the majority find them near home. // // - Multiple murderers are not , as a rule , insane , by most legal definitions . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 9 of the suspects pleaded innocent by reason of insanity and only 4 of those were found insane . " The typical mass murderer is extraordinarily ordinary , " said Dr. Fox . " He doesn ' t stand out in the crowd . He ' s not a glassy-eyed lunatic . " <> <> We Can ' Rule People Out ' // // Yet , there is widespread disagreement about the psychology , character and background of multiple murderers. // " We have some basic clinical knowledge of serial murderers that allows us to rule people out , " said Dr. John Liebert , a psychiatrist at the University of Washington in Seattle . " What we don ' t have is how to rule them in . " Dr. Liebert has been a consultant on three cases of multiple murder , including the " Green River " slayings in which 26 women , mostly prostitutes , have been killed in the Seattle area. // There is a peculiar public fascination with multiple murder . Abhorrent as a murder is , people can comprehend its typical rationales : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness to a crime. // But the kind of murderer who kills again and again , sometimes choosing his victims at random and often driven by a seemingly unquenchable lust for blood , exercises a special grip on the public ' s imagination because his murders are so incomprehensible . <> <> A Mass Murderer Explodes // // Most experts feel the serial murderer and the single-outburst mass murderer are two distinct types . The mass murderer is usually someone who explodes at a moment . While his frenzy at that moment can seem insatiable , it exhausts itself and he will probably never kill again. // " The type of a person who commits a mass murder , " said Dr. Liebert , " is frequently more of a paranoid personality who just blows over his threshold. " // That threshold is often crossed because of a tangible episode that follows a string of defeats and rejections . The threat of divorce drives an unstable man to murder not only his wife but their children and sometimes himself . The loss of his job as a security guard , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the hamburger restaurant to even the score with the wider humanity that had so often frustrated him . <> <> Psychotics and Sadists // // Dr. Emanuel Tanay , a forensic psychiatrist at Wayne State University , feels that most mass murderers have lost contact with or have a defective sense of reality . He feels the number of such psychotic mass murders has risen in recent years because of a national policy of releasing large numbers of the mentally ill into their communities , particularly into communities where such firepower as the Uzi semiautomatic rifle used by Mr. Huberty is easily available. // A psychotic , Dr. Tanay said , has such a disorganized mind that he does not limit his need for aggression to a specific person . Had Mr. Huberty been rational , he might have contained his need for revenge to the man who fired him from his job. // Most serial killers are sexual sadists , the experts say . In his 1975 study , " Murder and Madness , " Dr. Donald T. Lunde wrote that the sadistic murderer derives " sexual pleasure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Such killers , he wrote , " often have had no experience of normal sexual intercourse , " yet the " act of killing itself produces very powerful sexual arousal in these individuals , some of whom will attempt sexual intercourse with the victim. " // Dr. Tanay , however , notes that the serial killer - he prefers the terms compulsive murderer or lust murderer - does not give any visible signs of derangement , even under the most expert examination. // Dr. Tanay was called in as an expert witness by the judge in the Bundy case , and found Mr. Bundy , he said in an interview , " just as lucid and pleasant a person as you would want to meet. " // " You don ' t find any overt psychopathology in examining him , " Dr. Tanay said. // Indeed , Dr. Liebert says one of the personality types he rules out in cases of serial murder is a " very disorganized psychotic individual . " <> <> ' A New Personality Type ' // // Dr. Helen Morrison , a psychiatrist in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the serial killer in routine interviews . That is why she has spent long periods with the multiple murderers she has interviewed , including 800 hours with John Wayne Gacy , a prosperous building contractor who was convicted in 1980 of murdering 33 young men and boys in the Chicago area . She believes the serial killer is a " new personality type. " // First , she says , the serial killer does not distinguish between human beings and inanimate objects . Richard Macek , who gained notoriety as the " Mad Biter " for bite marks he left on the flesh of young women he tortured and murdered in Illinois and Wisconsin in the 1970 ' s , once told her a dream in which he imagined attacking a person . " Picked up the person , slammed them into wall , beating until death , lifeless or unconscious , " he wrote in describing the dream. // " He doesn ' t know the difference between those three states , " Dr. Morrison observed in an interview . " That ' s striking because to us death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s not . He shows no awareness of the pain or feeling or the existence of another person. " // The serial murderers evince absolutely no guilt , she said . Mr. Gacy , most of whose victims were found buried under his home , once said to her that all the police " are going to get me for is running a funeral parlor without a license . " <> <> Peculiarly Obsessive Traits // // They have grandiose ideas about their power and also display peculiarly obsessive traits . Mr. Gacy , she said , kept notebooks that recorded what he did minute by minute , even logging such trivia as the precise moment he mailed a letter . " This tremendous organization is about the only structure they have , " Dr , Morrison said of the serial killers . " In prisons they generally become trusties. " // She believes that " the defect that occurs in these individuals occurs before they ' re 6 months old . " For example , she said , as a newborn Mr. Gacy was given daily enemas by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences tend to be expressed as a world that persecutes them , " she said . " They are very fearful . They have fears of death , of total helplessness , of total psychological fragmentation. " // Somehow , Dr. Morrison said , the childhood fear of psychological fragmentation translates itself into a confusion of roles . " The victim becomes the persecutor and the persecutor becomes the victim , " she said. // Once when she interviewed Mr. Macek in prison he appeared before her with a terry cloth towel draped around his neck . Since Mr. Macek had been accused of killing his victims with a terry towel , Dr. Morrison was frightened and asked a prison guard to take away the towel . Mr. Macek , she recalled , was piqued , and said to her , " You ' d think I was going to kill you. " // Dr. Morrison said she believed that " the killings seem to be a way " for the murderers " of integrating their psychological status. " // " Murder is a way for them to regain themselves from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , " she said , " is what is it about the victim that they fulfill the mass murderer ' s psychological needs ? " While the murderers can not explain why they chose particular victims , Dr. Morrison said she believed that the victims were symbolic of something or someone deeply significant in the murderers ' lives . Some psychologists have specifically said the victims represent cruel parents on whom some murderers feel they can not take revenge . <> <> Flaw in Early Development // // Dr. Liebert , while emphasizing that in-depth psychological research is sorely lacking , feels that perhaps in the first three years of the person ' s life a flaw occurs in the bonding process between mother and infant so that they develop a sadistic , aggressive relationship with each other. // As a result , he suggests , these individuals either idealize the women they form relationships with or degrade them . They see women , Dr. Liebert said , " as either angels or whores " and there seems to be no sensible middle ground. // The inadequacy of this theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been lots of people like this and only a tiny , tiny percentage that ever killed. " // Dr. Morrison suggests that psychology alone may not explain the abberation of compulsive murder . Since few multiple murderers are women , she speculates that possibly the mystery of the mass murderer may lie in the sex chromosomes . She also says the aberration " is not amenable to any intervention or treatment . " <> <> Are Multiple Murders Increasing ? // // There is an argument over whether multiple murders are increasing or whether there has just been more attention to them in recent years . Certainly the victim counts have gone up . In 1973 it was thought that Dean Corll had set the record for serial homicides when 26 bodies were unearthed in three shallow graves in Houston. // But new levels of carnage were reached with Mr. Bundy and Mr. Gacy , and their acts were dwarfed by those of Henry Lee Lucas , who says he has killed 360 men , women and children in several states . More than 142 of these have reportedly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is growing have several explanations . Dr. Liebert believes it has a lot to do with the age of television . " We have children in emotionally deprived families whose main nurturance is the TV set , " he said . " By the time they ' re 15 years old , they ' ve seen 10 , 000 murders on TV . The victims don ' t suffer . Murder is like going down to the store and getting a Popsicle. " // Ann Rule , a writer who became a nationally recognized expert on serial murders , thinks the growth of sadistic pornography is partly to blame . Sadistic pornography , she cautions , does not create a murderous personality but it can push potentially violent people over the edge. // Another underlying cause for the rise , Dr. Liebert said , is the rising incidence of family breakup , which can be crushing to the children involved . Mrs. Rule says that in a mobile society children do not have aunts , uncles and grandparents to fall back on when their parents fail them. // Pierce R. Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program at the F.B.I. Academy at Quantico , Va. , to coordinate information from local police agencies on serial killers , also thinks an increased mobility and dispersion of Americans is partly to blame for the rise in serial homicides. // " We are becoming more of a society of strangers , " he said , and the stresses that result may contribute to the growth of multiple murders. // //
