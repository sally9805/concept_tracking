Who was Jessica Savitch ? Millions of TV viewers knew her as the glamorous and authoritative NBC News anchor who was a role model for scores of aspiring women journalists . To her colleagues on the set , however , she was an anorexic , acne-scarred prima donna who would throw tantrums over the slightest inconvenience or reject a glass of water because it was too warm . And to those who claimed to know her best , she was a vivacious and vulnerable woman who became so debilitated by insecurity and drug abuse that she could barely function without a nursemaid . When Savitch 's end finally came in a freak car accident in 1983 , one close friend had already finished mourning : the Jessica she had once known had died years before . <P> Now , nearly five years later , Savitch 's troubled life is being resurrected in two searing biographies : Almost Golden by Gwenda Blair , a veteran magazine writer , and Golden Girl by Author Alanna Nash . The books tell many of the same painful stories , but while Nash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blair sets Savitch 's rise and fall against the larger backdrop of television-news history . Ultimately , neither writer completely succeeds in conveying what made Savitch run , perhaps because her personal demons were so well masked . <P> What is clear , however , is that the anchor had a remarkable gift for talking to a TV camera . Blair recounts that Savitch once told a colleague that her trick was to focus on a spot in the middle of her head and project it through her eyes to the other side of the lens .

' " <P> Savitch labored long and hard to master her craft and fight her way into a male-dominated profession . She was quick to realize that TV news was more about show business than journalism . As a fledgling reporter for KHOU-TV in Houston , she ended a report about an exhibit of World War II bombers by posing on a wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Philadelphia in 1972 , studied speech and became a celebrated anchor after starring in a series of personal reports about such topics as rape and childbirth . <P> But when at 30 she achieved her dream and joined NBC News as a Senate correspondent and weekend anchor , Savitch still lacked the ear-to-the-ground reporting skills needed to cover a demanding beat . Hired to add some allure to , the news division 's stodgy image , she was also expected to break stories on Capitol Hill and provide sparkle at numerous public appearances . She quickly foundered . " The people who brought her in here abandoned her , " said Tom Brokaw . Yet even as she was being demoted for incompetence , the network flacks and a willing press continued to tout her as TV news ' hottest new commodity .
