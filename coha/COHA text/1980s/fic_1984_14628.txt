The Scene : The play takes place over a four month period from May to late August during the year 1949 . The scenes move between a garden in Philadelphia , the McGregor ranch outside Billings , Montana , a Cunard Liner and various locations in France . There is no scenery , only specific pieces of furniture which always remain on stage but are rearranged to indicate several locales . The furniture includes four bentwood chairs , a small but attractive country side-table , a delicate antique armchair , an iron and brass single bed covered by a country quilt , and two filled feed sacks that together act as a sitable . At Rise : The central acting area is clear except for a pair of gardening shears , a hoe and work gloves . Lilian Landis , an attractive woman of 38 , dressed in a light white or pastel gardening frock stands upstage holding cut flowers and a trowel . Downstage is her daughter Jennifer , 16 , similarly dressed and holding cut flowers . Jennifer , in a fury and out of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others on stage ( and it is worth mentioning that no character ever leaves the stage , except for costume changes , but adjust themselves while remaining in character and watch scenes in which they take no direct part ) include : Esposito , a well-to-do Guatemalan , dealing in copper claims . He is in his early forties , seemingly gentle , somewhat evasive , gracious and keenly focused . He dresses mainly in summer white . Cairn McGregor , 45 , a Montana rancher , worn , watchful , hunted in an odd way . Marta McGregor , his wife and Lilian 's sister , 36 years of age . She is warm , fearful of the future , delicate with children and radiates a kind of unfulfilled promise . Dilly , Marta 's daughter of eighteen , is a pistol . Bright and cosseted , newly aware of her sexual powers , and demanding but easily embarrassed or angered . She is home from her first year at the university and made edgy by constraint . Doc , twenty-two years old , he is deaf and signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . He is a barometer of atmospheres , part Indian , and works for Cairn , raising , training and handling his game fowls , a consuming interest to them both . The " Driver , " a man in his forties with the high color that often marks an alcoholic . He was a non-commissioned officer in the recent great war . He has a cynical manner and a flat delivery . During the course of the play of fifteen scenes , there are no blackouts but only shifts of light while Lilian " corresponds " with Jennifer , all her dialogue being in actuality letters . She can stay in or near the antique chair or move through those who effect the brief scene changes . None of the other characters interact with her , though Jennifer reacts . She alone does not watch the action in progress but writes in her journal when she is not speaking . The lights come up on the two women , standing on an empty stage. @x The light leaves them and immediately Esposito strikes a match to light his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is dressed in a white linen summer suit and highly decorated cowboy boots .

ESPOSITO You understand me ? Si ? Fuedes leer mis labios ? ( The boy nods . Esposito points to a note the boy has given him . ) I also understand . Perhaps she can not love , hah ? She is the mimic of love . You pretend to be in love , you may even fool yourself , hah ? Not everyone hears , not everyone loves , you see ? Some can only be loved . This is their food . ( Doc holds up a warning hand so Esposito will speak slowly . ) Ah . Yes . El iman ? The magnet . You understand ? They give nothing , only attract . Only . A very bad thing perhaps , but their fate . They give the lesson , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one learns . ( He laughs . ) You see ? But part of life this fate . We accept this , hah ? Whatever comes . Whatever . Those who can not love they also serve God . Tambien servimos a Dios . ( Doc looks down . Esposito puts a finger under his chin and raises his head until their eyes meet . Esposito smiles . ) Sometimes those who can not love seek love from those who can not love . Hah ? This makes the big comedy , yes ? What a dance this is ! ( He laughs and ruffles the boy 's hair . ) You need boots my friend . ( He reaches in his pocket and fishes out a fat roll of bills . ) Black boots , hah ? With decorations . The Field-of-Lillies . Or the Climbing Rose . A man accepts his fate if he has boots . Toma'lo . ( He holds out several bills . The boy reaches toward them as the light fades .

Dilly tries by jumping to peer into a window . She is aware of Jennifer , behind her , only when she is greeted . JENNIFER LANDIS ( After watching for a moment . ) Hello .

He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esposito sits on a benchwood , a drum table with a lamp on it beside him . He sits with his arms crossed over his chest holding his own lapels .

MARTA MCGREGOR Do you like it here ? ESPOSITO Yes , of course . MARTA MCGREGOR Well enough to stay ? ESPOSITO I like this Montana far better than any place which is not my country . MARTA MCGREGOR When must you go ? ESPOSITO Many minutes , many hours , many , many days . MARTA MCGREGOR But gone by snowfall . It is very white and empty here in the winter . DILLY MCGREGOR ( Having been whispering she now moves away from Jennifer and we can hear her speak . ) So finally I just grabbed his old hand and put it right on my breast JENNIFER LANDIS You did n't ! DILLY MCGREGOR ( Imitating her . ) " You did n't . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I 've made you something . DILLY MCGREGOR It 's not so easy to flirt with a deef-an-dumb . They wo n't take a hint .

Everyday a wind blew she 'd put out the red blanket and sit to her window . She told me watching that blanket in the wind was the only thing saved her going crazy .

JENNIFER LANDIS Mother calls it a period of adjustment . p. 22 DILLY MCGREGOR Shirt has a tear . There 's more in the chest . JENNIFER LANDIS ( Opens the third drawer by mistake . ) Mother says that because we live and learn there are times when one or the other goes on ahead and then that one must wait or the other must hurry and catch up . DILLY MCGREGOR Sure . That must be it . ( Cairn walks in other room , sees Marta and Esposito . Jennifer finds a beautifully embroidered slip and holds it up . Dilly again snaps her fingers . ) Happened to me , though . I do n't want him to touch me . JENNIFER LANDIS ( Astounded . ) What 's this ? DILLY MCGREGOR From Mama . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" ) DILLY MCGREGOR What ? ( Jennifer mouths " Should we let them know we 're here ? " ) DILLY MCGREGOR What is it ? ( She has spoken too loudly . Cairn hears her . ) CAIRN MCGREGOR Who is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAIRN MCGREGOR Dolores ? JENNIFER LANDIS It 's only us , Mr. McGregor . ( Dilly throws her a furious look . ) MARTA MCGREGOR They 're all right , Cairn . p. 25 CAIRN MCGREGOR May I see you , Dolores ? ( A pause .

CAIRN MCGREGOR Within the next five seconds if you will . DILLY MCGREGOR I 'm half dressed , Papa . CAIRN MCGREGOR Now ! ( Dilly appears through the door .

CAIRN MCGREGOR Might you have been listening to my conversation with my wife ? JENNIFER LANDIS We did n't mean to , Mr. McGregor . DILLY MCGREGOR We were dressing up . CAIRN MCGREGOR Have I not explained to you the principle of privacy ? DILLY MCGREGOR Yes , Papa . CAIRN MCGREGOR You have the right to privacy , have you not , Jennifer ?

You find your privacy made public , why that'sthat is the most painful moment in a person 's life . You understand me ? ( Esposito enters carrying a cage by its handle . The cage is draped in red velour . Cairn notes his entrance . ) CAIRN MCGREGOR Now . You have invaded your Mother 's room and you were , both of you listening to a private conversation . ( Simultaneously . ) DILLY MCGREGOR No . JENNIFER LANDIS Yes , sir . CAIRN MCGREGOR ( Turning to Jennifer . ) And you a guest in my house . ( He shakes his head . ) Come to me , Dolores . DILLY MCGREGOR Why ? CAIRN MCGREGOR That I may teach you the helplessness of private matters made public . ( Esposito starts to leave . ) Stay here . MARTA MCGREGOR Do n't humiliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by learning . p. 28 DILLY MCGREGOR She did it too . CAIRN MCGREGOR Sometimes we must bear the burden for our friends . ( He sits . He beckons Dilly . ) Here . Pull up your dress . MARTA MCGREGOR She is eighteen years old , Cairn . CAIRN MCGREGOR Across my lap . MARTA MCGREGOR I will not stand for this . CAIRN MCGREGOR Nor will I. ( He strikes her six times . There is no sound or movement in the room other than thisafterwards a moment of shared embarrassment that includes Cairn . Dilly rises and smooths her dress . A pause . Esposito sets the cage down . He whips the covering off theatrically . ) ESPOSITO Mira ! ( He lifts up the cage . In it is a two-year-old black fighting cock. ) @x We are in the barn . Low , flickering light is provided by two kerosene lanterns . Diagonally across the stage from each other are two cages for game fowl hung from wires so they " float " about five feet in the air . In one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just seen Esposito bring into the living room . In the other is a white cock , the pride of Cairn 's fighting stable . In the shadows , Doc hunkers down , eating his evening meal from a canteen lid which sits between his legs , watching the conversation between Cairn and Esposito . Esposito stands sideways between the cockrels , he drinks deeply from a fifth of whiskey . Cairn leans against the wall whittling with a knife taken from a hunting sheath at his waist . Both the conversation and the drinking have been in progress for some time . ESPOSITO So the gaff hit him in the lung , this one 's brother ( He points to the black cockrel. ) and he had been deep gaffed on the first fly , rememberso we were called to handle and while I thumbed him for bleeding someone calls out " he 's dead , your chicken , " and I say " not so dead as the other , my friend " and he says to me , " My car says he is dead " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he says " Alpha Romeo " and I say , " Of this car I already have two . " Everybody laughs . " But , " I say , " But on the older one , one hubcap have I not , so I will bet my wife against your hubcap . " ( Esposito laughs and drinks . ) This is how we pass the time in Guatemala . p. 30 CAIRN MCGREGOR Then ? ESPOSITO My chicken killed him , but before I could pick him up he also died . CAIRN MCGREGOR Nothing in this world gamer than a gamecock . I had an Arkansas Traveler got both feet cut off and fought ten minutes on his back before he went . ESPOSITO ( Nostalgic , impressed . ) Ah . ( He goes over to the white cockrel 's cage . ) So this is the mayor of your village , eh ? CAIRN MCGREGOR Georgia Shawlneck . Started with them way back . Bought a trio off some barefoot kid at a Carolina Derby . Won 6 fights , that kid , took home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts you , he 'll cut you in half . ESPOSITO How many fights ? CAIRN MCGREGOR Eleven . ESPOSITO ( Appreciative . ) Ah . ( Turning back to his own gamecock . ) This one you do n't see in your states of America . I breed . CAIRN MCGREGOR Names ? ESPOSITO It has no name . It is only mine . CAIRN MCGREGOR Been pitted ? ESPOSITO ( Shakes his head , no . ) But I told you of his brother . ( He turns back to the other cage . ) Let me see the Shawlback . ( Cairn tosses a coin which hits Doc to catch his attention . Cairn gestures for him to take the cock to Esposito . Doc takes it from the cage and hands it to Esposito . Cairn notices Doc 's new boots. ) p. 31 CAIRN MCGREGOR Hey . ( Tosses another coin at Doc . He turns . ) Where 'd you get the boots ? ( Doc shakes his head as if not understanding . Cairn signs and speaks . ) The Boots . ( Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too expensive looks at Esposito . ) ESPOSITO ( Smiles , pointing at Doc . Speaking to Cairn . ) He has the hands for this . ( Cairn nods . ) In Guatemala there are a hundred men who would employ him . ( Esposito ruffles Doc 's hair . ) CAIRN MCGREGOR I believe the boy works for me . ESPOSITO ( He shrugs his acquiescence . Speaks to Doc who is looking at him . ) Good hands and good boots . ( Doc smiles . Esposito inspects the cock . ) He feels good . ( Holds the cock up . ) And the bright eye . CAIRN MCGREGOR ' Case you do n't know what you got there , that 's a hi-stakes cock . ESPOSITO Ah . You sell ? CAIRN MCGREGOR No . ESPOSITO Eggs ? CAIRN MCGREGOR No. p. 32 ESPOSITO He sees my chicken . CAIRN MCGREGOR I see he does . ( Gestures for Doc to take and cage the bird . He does . ) ESPOSITO I go back to Guatemala . We have stadium there for this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in your Montana . This respect you do n't pay . I am finished here so I go back . Sin hogar no hay Corazon . Only your chickens my chickens do not kill . You like my string ? CAIRN MCGREGOR Sure ? ESPOSITO Sure . Good Chickens . Listen , we fight these two , what do you think ? Your mayor and my mayor they have an election . Why not ? And we make hard stakes . CAIRN MCGREGOR Such as ? ESPOSITO Not money . The old way . CAIRN MCGREGOR What then ? ESPOSITO If him ( He points to Cairn 's cock . ) You take my string.Fifty , sixty chickens . I do n't take them home . CAIRN MCGREGOR And if I do n't get ' em ? ESPOSITO I wring their necks . A bad waste . But , I do n't like to sell , I have here no other friend I might present . I ca n't take back . So if I make them dead at least they are still mine . p. 33 CAIRN MCGREGOR ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's him ? ESPOSITO You will forgive your wife . CAIRN MCGREGOR ( Walks over to him . ) What for ? ESPOSITO Whatever you like . ( Cairn stares at him . ) You like this betting ? You want my string ? ( Cairn stares at him . ) Go ahead . I give you this too . Go ahead . ( Cairn slaps him. ) @x Jennifer and Marta sit on two sides of a rectangular embroidery frame . A table runner Marta has been working on is near completion . Marta has been teaching Jennifer to embroider . Each sits on one of the bentwood chairs . MARTA MCGREGOR Well , no one had seen Black John in or about his cabin so Cairn and I took a ride overlet the needle touch the side of the thimble near the topand naturally he was right as rain . Been out on one of his two week hunts and nothing would do but we must stay for a rabbit stew which Cairn hated because of the car smell in that old cabin , but there we were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yap , yapping at Cairn the whole time , yap , yap . So Cairn finally asks Black John what the dog was barking at , and the old codger says , " Not to worry , that dog takes on like that whenever someone 's eating out of his dish ! " ( Both Marta and Jennifer laugh . ) Careful there 's no joining mark when a new thread startsthat 's right . Well I wish I could make a life like my embroidery , do n't you ? I always think that , when I take out a row of stitches . Of course , two days after it 's done and on the table no one looks at it . Ah , well . ( To Jennifer again . ) I 'd finish with the " wheat ear " right to the edge . Carry it up and then slip the needle under the two straight stitches . ( Back to her own work . ) But I like the doing . I supply the neighbors . Whenever they hear I 'm coming they have to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Jennifer smiles . Marta glances at her own work . ) Well , is n't that nice ? Pull tight , that cotton floss lies loose . ( Pats Jennifer 's arm . ) Your mother never had head nor heart for hand work but you favor me , I think . When Lilian and I grew up she was always fixing her hair and I was always fixing the plumbing . ( An instruction to Jennifer . ) Use the small scissors . ( Back to her own work . ) You know what I think ? It 's the parts of the body runs people 's lives . Now Lilian was always run by the eyes , and I was always run by my hands . She did n't like someone 's or something 's looks , why that was that . One time she was invited to a beau 's home for dinner and she would n't sit to table because she did n't like the look of the chairs . Truly . Told me they were hateful and clumsy and probably mildewed and told them she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa paddle her when he heard ! And he hit harder than Cairn . Parents . Well , we survive them mainly . With a few nicks and scratches . Whenever a parent gets broken the child thinks it 's her fault . ( Looking at Jennifer 's work . ) Good , good , good . Your father and mother may both come back from Paris to live together at 312 Dansinger Way or they may not . But you 're almost past the time for you to cry over it . You belong to yourself now . You 'll see . It 's surprising but it 's true . p. 35 JENNIFER LANDIS Do you love Mr. McGregor ? MARTA MCGREGOR Within limits . Within certain limits . We 'll see . Not something to be cried over . Beginning or ending , I ca n't tell . JENNIFER LANDIS Do you esteem Mr. Esposito ? MARTA MCGREGOR Mr. Esposito ? Well , yes . We all do , do n't we ? JENNIFER LANDIS Do you think him handsome ? MARTA MCGREGOR ( Smiling . ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work . Referring to the embroidery they are working on . ) Here 's something dead certain finished and that 's a fact . The nice thing about embroidery is you can always tell when you 're done . Will your Mother like it , do you think ? ( Jennifer nods . Marta looks at the work . ) This seems so real to me sometimes that I forget to remember I 'm in this world . And that 's a mercy . ( Marta leans forward and kisses Jennifer on top of her head . ) Yes , I esteem Mr. Esposito , and so do you . It 's all right . ( She watches as Jennifer resumes her work. ) @x Lilian 's letter beginning with " the storm is gone " takes place simultaneously with the beginning of the following mime . Esposito has gone for an afternoon walk and fallen asleep , his walking stick in his hand , one knee bent , his head pillowed on a stone . Jennifer and Dilly , out for a walk , see him . Dilly whispers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dilly whispers again and moves to Esposito and picks up his jacket which he has carefully folded beside him and puts it on . Over Jennifer 's agonized but thrilled objections she removes his hat which covered his face , putting that on also . She takes off her shoes and slips her feet into his . Finally she approaches and carefully removes his walking stick from his hand . She tickles his feet . He sits up startled out of sleep . DILLY MCGREGOR ( In Spanish . ) Hijo de Perra , mi presioso Callo esta muerto . Adoude encontrare ' otto asi . ( Marta enters carrying two buckets , one feed , one water . She watches . Rising , Esposito starts toward Dilly . She kicks her shoes at him , and flees with the hat and walking stick . He pursues her . Just when she is cornered , she tosses the walking stick to Jennifer who , surprised , catches it . Esposito turns away from Dilly to Jennifer . Jennifer tries to run by him but he catches her around the waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick out and away from his body where he can not reach it . Being tickled she laughs and twists frantically in his grip until she lies on her back her arms extended over her head still holding the stick . He is on one knee above her . Dilly suddenly cries out. ) p. 38 DILLY MCGREGOR Stop it ! ( Esposito turns to look at her . ) I 'm sorry . ( The tableau holds for an instant and Blacks out. )
