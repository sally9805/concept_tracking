In Senate races in Missouri and Virginia , every candidate seems to have an Achilles ' heel-or two . But as the campaigns enter their final days , the candidates are still trying to step up the pace . The polls are showing their races too tight to call . Meanwhile , in important House battles in Illinois and California , Republican candidates are receiving White House aid , and Democratic opponents are trying hard to capitalize on voter concerns about the economy . <P> Close encounter <P> Just as Missouri lies at the statistical center of the U.S. population , first-term Senator John Danforth , 46 , is at the political center of the Republican Party . And until very recently that seemed a decidedly safe place to be . But Danforth , who confidently hoped to coast to reelection , is being challenged by Harriett Woods , 55 , a peppy , articulate liberal and the only woman running for the Senate this year under the Democratic banner . Several weeks ago , a poll by the St. Louis Globe-Democrat showed Danforth with a 17-point lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods pulling even . <P> The candidates ' styles could not be more dissimilar . Danforth , an uncommonly shy campaigner who appears on the stump infrequently , is an ordained Episcopal priest and an heir to the Ralston Purina dog-food and cereal fortune . He is emphasizing his efforts to help two beleaguered groups-the state 's auto workers ( with increased tariff protections against imports ) and its farmers ( with rural enterprise zones ) . But , as the first Republican elected to the Senate from Missouri since 1946 , Danforth is de-emphasizing his ties to the Reagan economic program . One of his political ads urges voters to forget the Republican Party and vote for the man . <P> Woods , a well-known radio and TV journalist before becoming a state senator from the St. Louis suburb of University City , last year upset the favored primary candidate of old-line Democrats . Playing up her criticism of Reaganomics , she has sought to picture Danforth , a member of the Senate Finance Committee , as an accomplice to the 10.1% unemployment rate . Woods vigorously supports increased aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although her candidacy has been a magnet for women 's groups from all over the country , she has raised only some $750,000 so far , not enough for the heavy TV exposure she may need to unseat an incumbent . To compensate , Woods marches in just about every parade she can find , arriving at the scene at the wheel of her own modest Chevette . She also calls on Son Pete , a former starting quarterback at the University of Missouri , for handshaking appearances . <P> By way of counterattack , Danforth is outspending Woods by roughly 2 to 1 , with half of his $1.6 million budget earmarked for television . Alluding to the many women 's groups flocking to his opponent , the normally understated candidate declares , " Any minute I expect Jane Fonda to storm the battlements of Missouri . " She may not be needed . Several weeks ago , Danforth led Woods by a full ten points among women in the Globe-Democrat poll ; according to last week 's poll , Woods ' support among women now tops Danforth 's by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither candidate is a shoo-in . <P> Byrd-dogging
