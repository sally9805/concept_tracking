Susan K. has a good job , sturdy feminist principles and no interest , at the moment , in getting married . She also has a married lover , which makes her the prototype of The New Other Woman in Sociologist Laurel Richardson 's book of that name ( Free Press ; $17.95 ) . The old-fashioned mistress was usually depicted as a skulking and tragically trapped figure , racked by guilt . The newer version , born of feminism and the sexual revolution , says Richardson , is more blas and confident about her life . " First of all , she does n't want to get married , does n't want to husband-steal , " Richardson explains . " There are other things she wants to do . She feels in charge of her life . The stigma is not gone , but it 's fading . She 's not the scarlet woman anymore . Call her the pink woman or something like that . " <P> Richardson , 47 , a professor at Ohio State University , is married and says she has never served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She got interested in the topic when one of her students , involved with a married man , asked about the research on the subject . " There was n't any , so I did a study myself , " says Richardson , who talked to 700 Other Women , 55 of them at some length . <P> In general , she found , the Other Woman of today is either pursuing a promising career or trying to get past the turmoil of a divorce . A majority of Richardson 's women had been married once and had had affairs with older men , often a mentor or a boss . A few entered into affairs cynically to get ahead at the office . Others wanted to experiment sexually with a disposable partner . But most seemed to drift into sexual relationships with a man they had previously pigeonholed as a friend , not a lover . By convincing themselves that the man would somehow remain merely a friend , these women even managed to gloss over sexual intercourse . The first act of sex , Richardson writes , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter the original basis of the relationship . " <P> Richardson thinks that these mental gymnastics result from women being taught to avoid conflict and keep relationships running smoothly . This , writes the author , " may mean ignoring or overlooking discordant messages , and taking the blame for any misunderstandings . " One woman in Richardson 's study , who regularly went to a disco with her boss , convinced herself that the relationship was purely a business one . <P> Richardson 's women had some trouble keeping matters carefree and cool . " They started out thinking they were going to be safe , " she says . " Then they got caught , and they ended up caring about him . " Richardson found that this happened even to veteran Other Women on their third or fourth affair . The single woman who falls in love with a married man often creates a private culture of shared jokes , " month-iversaries , " and a scrapbook or photo album that takes on a " semi-sacred " character by affirming a relationship that can not be made public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
