At first glance Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri , 49 , appears to be the very model of a modern civil servant . Indeed , he served 15 years with the parks and recreation department before getting elected to the city council in 1970 . Slight ( 5 ft. 6 in. ) and unobtrusive , he has the muzzy charm of a maitre d ' and avoids controversies as if they were fatal diseases . As a Democrat in a city where his party has a 5-to-1 lead in registrations , Caliguiri ( pronounced Cal-i-jeery ) would be favored for reelection . But the diffident mayor is so popular that barring disaster , he is a shoo-in for a second four-year term next November . <P> A major reason for Caliguiri 's lock on his job is that he has presided over one of the few success stories among cities of the recession-plagued Northeast . Despite high unemployment in the steel industry , corporations have invested $1.5 billion in new office buildings , speeding Pittsburgh 's transition from mill town to corporate center . Caliguiri is spending millions more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrade housing in the city 's older neighborhoods . Predicts the mayor : " Pittsburgh is going to be the first major city in the Northeast to see actual gains in population . " ( It lost 18.5% in the past decade . ) <P> If politics were pitching , Caliguiri would be called sneaky fast . In 1977 maverick Mayor Peter Flaherty quit to take a job in the Carter Administration . As city council president , Caliguiri automatically became interim mayor ; an Italian immigrant 's son and home-town boy , he got his first city job , as he puts it , as " a grunt in the parks department . " In return for six months in the municipal limelight , Caliguiri promised Democratic bosses that he would n't run for a full term . Or so they understood . Shortly after the primary , lifelong Party Regular Caliguiri turned uppity and declared himself an independent candidate . He cannily put the city 's money where his mouth was . Between taking over as mayor and easily beating the official Democratic candidate , Mayor Caliguiri spent $17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . <P> Caliguiri 's style is to try for conciliation rather than confrontation . On his first day in office , he skipped an important Democratic rally to dine at the bluebloods ' Duquesne Club with members of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development . The conference , which included the heads of Gulf , U.S. Steel and other corporations , had been largely responsible for the " Renaissance " of the late ' 40s and ' 50s that rebuilt the downtown Golden Triangle . At that dinner , Caliguiri spoke about his desire to re-establish good relations between business and city hall . <P> The building boom that began shortly after that dinner has been dubbed " Renaissance II . " <P> The mayor has staffed his administration with dedicated professionals , some of them Republicans . Somehow he has avoided embroilment in the city 's two major recent controversies : a court-ordered school desegregation plan , and the awarding of a cable TV contract by the city council that is still in litigation . An administrator 's administrator , Richard Caliguiri has managed to turn quiet competence into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
