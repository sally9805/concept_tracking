Most actresses would give anything to appear simultaneously in a major movie and a New York play . Last year Glenn Close was doing just that , in the film The Big Chill and Broadway 's The Real Thing . This year for a topper , Close , 37 , is trying two of each . The Connecticut-born actress opens this week in an off-Broadway play , Childhood , and recently did an off-off-Broadway performance of Arthur Honegger 's oratorio Joan of Arc at the Stake . At the same time , she has two movies in the can : The Jagged Edge , a courtroom drama , and Maxie , a romantic comedy about a 1920s actress whose spirit materializes in the present . " I love doing comedy , " enthuses Close , " and I love dressing up . " But given the choice , as she has been , Close prefers the real stage to the chill of film . Her roots are in the theater , she says . " It gives me a chance to relate to a live audience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . "
