In a nation where style is often as important as substance , Carlos Salinas de Gortari seems an unlikely choice to be President . He is short and almost bald , and his bushy mustache and outsize ears are a caricaturist 's delight . His appetite for hard work and rapid-fire oratory have earned him the irreverent nickname Atomic Ant . Yet last week the Harvard-educated Salinas was named the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party for the July 1988 presidential election . Although Salinas will face opponents , his victory is virtually assured ; the monolithic P.R.I . has not lost a national election since its founding in 1929 . <P> Salinas , 39 , will be Mexico 's youngest President in more than a half- century . Like his three predecessors , Salinas is a technocrat and has never held an elected post , although he is the first economist ever to serve in a job occupied primarily by lawyers . Still , Salinas brings ample experience to the presidency , which carries a six-year term . As the Minister of Budget and Planning since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado 's austerity program . Salinas ' task will be to guide Mexico 's economy from the sleepy epoch of the sombrero into the dynamic age of the superconductor . At the same time , he faces mounting demands to loosen the P.R.I . ' s grip on the country 's political system . <P> While a steady devaluation of the peso has boosted exports and helped build foreign reserves of $15 billion , the reforms have produced an annual inflation rate of 130% . Additional cutbacks in public spending are certain to further antagonize Mexico 's powerful labor unions , which have grown angry as purchasing power has shrunk by as much as 40% during the past five years . Moreover , Mexico has a foreign debt of more than $100 billion that consumes about $1 billion a month in interest payments . Although a showdown with the labor unions may come , Salinas is expected to follow De la Madrid 's austerity course . <P> On the political front , however , Salinas ' success may depend on how quickly he distinguishes himself from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption have long dogged the P.R.I. , the allegations are growing dangerously heated . Last year the situation turned particularly bitter after closely contested mayoral elections in the northern state of Chihuahua , a stronghold of the conservative National Action Party , the largest of the eight opposition parties . Afterward a P.R.I . official conceded , " We may have won the elections , but we have lost the people . " <P> Recently , the party leadership faced its most serious internal challenge ever . Led by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , 53 , the son of a former President , a faction insisted that the selection process be opened up . The party met the demand halfway . Instead of keeping the process secret , the party leadership made public a list of six names . Each of the candidates then fielded questions from party officials at televised breakfast meetings .
