Theoren Fleury , the little man nobody wanted , got the gigantic goal that Calgary needed Sunday night . The rookie center , 5 feet 5 inches without skates but a big scorer with them , broke a 2-2 tie midway through the second period and the Flames , sparked by defenseman Al MacInnis ' two goals , beat the Montreal Canadiens 3-2 in the opener of the Stanley Cup finals . " I just let the shot go . I wasn ' t looking , " Fleury said of his 15-footer from the left faceoff dot at 11 : 45 of the second period . " I had a reputation for scoring goals when I came up here . I did that . " The second game of the best-of-seven series is Wednesday night in Calgary . Fleury , who went through two drafts without being chosen , was finally taken by the Flames in the eighth round in 1987 . He was called up from Salt Lake City of the International League on Jan. 1 and had 14 goals in 36 regular-season games with Calgary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them game-winners . " I would have done anything " to play in the NHL , he said . " It ' s been a long road , a lot of long bus trips . . . . I never lost heart . I never lost confidence that I could make it . " " He ' s a little player who plays like a big man , " Flames coach Terry Crisp said . " You ' ve got to give him some respect because of his speed . " The Flames also won the 1986 opener at home against Montreal in their only other trip to the finals . But the Canadiens won the next four games and claimed the most recent of their record 23 Stanley Cups . " We have to take care of the present , " Montreal defenseman Larry Robinson said . " The first period was not the type of period that you have to play to beat Calgary . " " I thought we played our style , " Montreal coach Pat Burns said . " They ' re a big , strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fleury said he slipped behind the defense when the Canadiens headed for 197-pound defenseman Jamie Macoun , who had the puck at the Montreal blue line . Macoun , rushing up ice , passed to Fleury in the left circle . Fleury , on the move , fired it between the legs of Patrick Roy , the NHL ' s leading goalie in the regular season and playoffs . " I don ' t really know those guys , so I learned a lot , " Roy said . " We came here to win one of two . It ' s going to be harder to win one of one . " Fleury ' s goal gave the Flames their 10th victory in their last 11 games . Calgary was 45-0-2 in the regular season and is 10-1 in the playoffs in games it led after two periods . It was the first victory by a home team in four meetings this season between Calgary and Montreal . Stephane Richer and Robinson scored for Montreal , whose 115 regular-season points were second only to Calgary ' s 117 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 218 , eight fewer than Calgary . The opener between the NHL ' s top two defenses was surprisingly wide-open as Calgary had 35 shots on goal and Montreal 31 . It was remarkably so during the first 10 : 02 , in which each team scored twice . Richer opened the scoring with a power-play goal at 2 : 43 . He took a pass from Shayne Corson , went around MacInnis in the left circle and shot a 20-footer that banked off the post to the right of goalie Mike Vernon for his sixth playoff goal . But 18 seconds after Robinson was penalized for hooking , MacInnis atoned for his error with the first power-play goal against the Canadiens in nine games . Montreal had killed the last 28 power plays against it . Less than two minutes later , at 8 : 33 , MacInnis beat Roy again for his fifth goal and 24th point of the playoffs . But Robinson tied the score at 10 : 02 when his pass across the slot hit defenseman Macoun ' s skate and slid past Vernon.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
