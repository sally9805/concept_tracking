At the same time the Pakistani Government denied news accounts that it had rejected an Afghan proposal for peace talks and there was a report that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India had declined a Soviet invitation to come to Moscow . A diplomatic gavotte appeared to be in full swing. // While no country has changed its basic orientation , the Pakistanis are flirting with the Russians , perhaps to goad the United States into a fresh infusion of military aid , while the Indians seem to be downplaying their ties to Moscow to prevent the United States from tilting too sharply toward Pakistan. // Moscow , meanwhile , seems eager to win international endorsement of the Soviet-backed Government in Afghanistan . <> <> Debate in Congress Scheduled // What has brought urgency to the maneuvers is a scheduled debate in the United States Congress next month on ways to augment deliveries of advanced weapons to Pakistan . In addition , the issue of Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan is on the agenda of the coming session of the United Nations General Assembly. // As Mr. Firyubin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry officials had centered on Soviet-Pakistani relations , the General Assembly agenda and the international situation . Pakistani officials had little to say on the tone of the talks , but they were eager not to appear confrontational. // " We in Pakistan attach the greatest importance to our relations with the Soviet Union , " said Agha Shahi , a Government spokesman . " We desire to build our ties on the basis of friendship , cooperation and mutual trust as spelled out in the principles of peaceful coexistence . " He added that the reports of the rejection of an Afghan peace initiative were " misleading and tendentious. " // The Afghan initiative , timed to coincide with the Soviet official ' s visit here , waived prior objections to Pakistani insistence that any talks must include Iran . Having denied reports of rejecting the package , Pakistan ' s official position is that it is now awaiting a text to study the proposal . <> <> Breakthrough Is Doubted // Privately , well placed Pakistanis say there is no likelihood of a breakthrough , either on a formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloof posture toward Moscow . Some of these sources say Pakistan is seeking " greater flexibility . " Opening channels for discussion with the Soviet Union is said to enhance Pakistan ' s claim to nonalignment . At the same time , some diplomats suggested , by hinting at possible , even minimal , accommodation with Moscow , Pakistan is reinforcing its message to Washington. // That message is simple . It asks that the United States Government do whatever it must to gain the Congressional approval required for restoring economic aid and selling military supplies. // There are essentially two packages . The first , involving $3. 2 billion of military sales credits and economic assistance , requires modification of the so-called Glenn ammendment , which bars such aid to countries unwilling to give credible assurances that they are not trying to obtain nuclear arms . To bypass this roadblock , the Reagan Administration is pressing for Congressional action to bring the amendment in line with the Symington amendment , a similar formulation that permits such sales if the President declares them to be in the national interest . <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration proposal is scheduled to begin next month in the House Foreign Affairs Committee , and Pakistan is watching closely and pushing for passage . In New Delhi , where the Government has expressed fears that the arms could be used against India , a diplomatic effort is being made to thwart passage , or at least limit the shape of the ultimate arms package. // The second package at issue is direct cash sales of military equipment . Cash sales are not linked to the issue of potential nuclear arming , but , in view of the money involved , perhaps $750 million , they can be blocked if both houses of Congress vote to do so within 30 days after the President approves the sales. // The military shopping list in both packages has not been fully decided on by the Pakistanis though they have pressed for early delivery of F-16 jet fighters . This plane is worrisome to the Indians , who contend that it is a generation ahead of any plane in the larger Indian Air Force . They say that the fighter would not allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless in regard to Afghanistan , and that it can therefore serve to menace India . <> <> Soviet MIG-25 ' s Acquired by India // Within the last week , the Indians announced the acquisition of Soviet MIG-25 fighters , which are at least equal to the F-16 ' s , and have talked with a French delegation about purchasing the latest Mirages . Meanwhile , Jeane J. Kirkpatrick , the United States representative at the United Nations , said during a visit to New Delhi two days ago that the sale of jets and other arms to Pakistan did not pose a threat to India . Mrs. Gandhi said she disagreed. // Mrs. Kirkpatrick is due here tomorrow and , after discussions with Pakistani officials , will tour Afghan refugee camps . The head of the other United States delegation , M. Peter McPherson , head of the Agency for International Development , visited a camp today. // Mr. McPherson is holding talks about the economic package that is to be put together if Congress eliminates the limitation related to Pakistan ' s nuclear weapons quest . Before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is a little delicate . I am going to Pakistan and may talk out something that Congress has not yet approved. " // The final flourish in the diplomatic choreography involved Mr. Firyubin ' s departure for New Delhi . He had not been scheduled to go there , and there was no explanation for the detour. // Pakistani newspapers carried news accounts from New Delhi saying that Mrs. Gandhi had decided not to go to Moscow on a visit coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the Indian-Soviet friendship treaty , pleading the pressure of domestic responsibilities . She is , however , scheduled to go to Fiji and to a meeting of developed and developing nations in Mexico in October , and last week she accepted an invitation from President Francois Mitterrand of France. // The dance continues . It is a flirtatious dance that calls for flexibility. //
