 | I think this is impossible to do , " says Linda Ronstadt . " I do n't know why I 'm doing this . I want to go home . " What the gifted pop star is doing is singing the part of Mimi in Joseph Papp 's production of " La Boheme " at the Public Theater in New York . Ronstadt was nervous four years ago when she made her leap into musical theater in Papp 's production of Gilbert and Sullivan 's " The Pirates of Penzance , " but what she 's feeling now is something close to terror . " Pirates " was a huge hit ; " La Boheme " may not be . But Ronstadt is n't going home . She 's going to keep stretching her big , ever-expanding talent by attacking a role that few pop singers would dare to even contemplate . Her performance as Puccini 's doomed heroine is a profile in courage as well as an episode in the ongoing movement toward synthesis between " high " and " low " in America 's musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was performed by the New York City Opera ; the nonoperatic cast of " Boheme " is returning the favor . The results in both cases are mixed , but the exchange of energies between the pop and opera worlds will continue . As for Ronstadt , her Mimi has the sweetness and delicate simplicity of Puccini 's fragile minx . Of course she 'd be more comfortable at the Grand Ole Opry than at the opera , but there is a grave dignity and haunted sensuousness in her Mimi that is not always encountered in opera houses . Tainted Innocence : Ronstadt 's singing has always pivoted on the shifting fortunes of love , notably in her beautiful last two albums , " What 's New " and " Lush Life , " in which with arranger Nelson Riddle she 's gone back to the classic pop tunes of the prerock age . Her Mimi has the nuance of tainted innocence that we hear in those albums . In fact , this " Boheme " has an ardent sensual quality that comes through its youthful cast , notably David Carroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard McGillin as his buddy Marcel . But Ronstadt ( who alternates with Patti Cohenour and Caroline Peyton ) and her colleagues are not well served by director Wilford Leach , who did such a brilliant job with " Pirates . " He has found no real shape or pulse for the action . What 's more , he has introduced into the English adaptation such jarring touches as some modern jargon and has permitted the talented Cass Morgan to sing Musette with the farcical fervor of Dorothy Loudon . William Elliott conducts forcefully , but the orchestration for 12 musicians by Michael Starobin strips Puccini 's score of most of its luscious lyricism . But of course this " La Boheme " centers on Ronstadt . Her candid anxiety is the measure of her determination . " The other night , " she says , " I felt something slip down my throat and I forgot to take my breath . I had to breathe in the middle of a word and it was like looking at your subway stop go by . " Breathing is not the only problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I stood up and felt it start down my leg and I thought This damn thing is going to fall out of my skirt onto my feet in the middle of my aria , ' so I just kept getting up and sitting down . " Free Form ' : Ronstadt has wanted to sing " La Boheme " for years . She learned Italian by going to the Berlitz school and listened constantly to recordings , especially her favorite " Boheme , " the great ' 50s version with Jussi Bjoerling as Rodolfo and Victoria de Los Angeles as Mimi . " I made the mistake of thinking I could learn the opera that way , " she says , " but I could n't . It 's so freeform you have to learn it exactly . " Ronstadt , who does n't read music , was taken through the opera 's score by composer Allen Shawn . " He 's one of my real guiding heroes , " she says . " He taught me all that music by rote . He tried to teach me to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . " Impossible . Lots of pop singers are great readers . I think my brain simply does n't work that way . " Her vocal problems center not on the operatic heights but in the tough middle register , where most of Mimi is sung . " High C is easy for me , " she says . " I look forward to it every night . I can sing real high and I can sing on the bottom . But shifting gears from low to high is the hard thing . No wonder singers call that middle break the Devil 's Canyon . " Ronstadt did not want to " cheat " by using her chest tones . But tenor Placido Domingo , who came to hear her one night , told her that it was n't cheating . " He said opera singers do that all the time . " Latin Music : Ronstadt resents the stories that say she 's worn out her rock singing . " I am not trying to start a career as an opera singer , " she says fiercely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future so I wo n't be this aged rock-and-roll singer . I can sing rock as long as I bloody well want to . And I can certainly sing the old songs until I 'm 97 . " She wants to do another pop-classic album , perhaps of Cole Porter ; she wants to do an album with Smokey Robinson ; she wants to get into the Latin music that she grew up hearing from her parents of Mexican-German descent . But right now she 's focusing ferociously on Mimi . When she strained her throat her doctor told her she was killing her voice , that she was not prepared to do this kind of thing . " He 'd given me an open door , " she says , " and I thought , I can go through it . But I ca n't . This is the most crippling thing I 've ever experienced . But for me it 's the best thing I 've ever done because of the distance I 've had to cover . " At 38 , Ronstadt may have arrived at a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
