Corrosive salts spark an international controversy <P> Muslim fanatics knocked its nose off , Greeks scrawled graffiti on its paws and Mamluk soldiers used its face as a rifle target . But the saddest indignity suffered over the centuries by Egypt 's Great Sphinx of Giza has stemmed from erosion , seemingly caused by a single enemy-the relentless desert wind . At the present rate of decay , experts say , the 64-foot-high figure could be reduced to a mound of dust in five to ten centuries . <P> Now , however , a newly discovered threat to the 4,500-year-old monument poses fresh problems for conservationists . It has also triggered a scientific and political controversy . A chemical analysis of the Sphinx by K. Lal Gauri , 48 , a stone-preservation expert at the University of Louisville , suggests that salt , not wind , is the main cause behind the statue 's decay . <P> Salts occur naturally in the Sphinx 's limestone . Because of the hot days and relatively cool nights of the desert , water in the air condenses and dissolves the salts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salts crystallize again , they crack pores within the stone . In recent years , scientists agree , the salt damage has been accelerated by the Aswan High Dam , more than 400 miles upriver . The new dam has raised the water table throughout the Nile Valley . Another villain has been the high-salt mortar used to restore the flaking monument . " Walking on top of the Sphinx in the morning , " says Gauri , " you can hear the stones popping like potato chips . " <P> Gauri 's analysis was prompted by the American Research Center in Egypt ( ARCE ) and the Egyptian Antiquities Organization ( EAO ) . The agencies set out jointly in 1979 to clean and map the monument . The task of producing a detailed architectural chart of the Sphinx was taken on by Mark Lehner , 32 , ARCE 's field director . At Lehner 's invitation , Gauri visited the site in 1980 . <P> Gauri , who has worked on the Taj Mahal and the Acropolis , proposes that the Egyptians flush out the Sphinx 's salt deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortar . " If the work is done right , " says Gauri , " it should last as long as the stones of the pharaohs . " <P> Last October a section of veneer in the statue 's left haunch collapsed . The Egyptians postponed consideration of Gauri 's plan , formed seven committees to study the problem , and began to repair the Sphinx 's left side . In the Egyptian view , the main threat to the Sphinx is not from humidity but from the higher water table . <P> The delicate situation has been complicated by the hovering presence of Houston 's Susan Beth Franzheim , 41 , the wife of Kenneth Franzheim II , former U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand , Fiji and Tonga . Franzheim , who believes she may be the reincarnation of Senmut , an Egyptian court adviser who lived some 3,400 years ago , donated $20,000 to ARCE for Gauri 's initial research and offered to raise $60,000 more . <P> When Franzheim criticized the EAO for charging ahead and ignoring Gauri , the EAO barred her from the site and refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mallakh , cultural editor of Cairo 's al Ahram newspaper : " We are experts , and the Sphinx is Egyptian . It is our glory , our history . "
