In Cincinnati , nervous depositors formed lines up to a block long and even slept on sidewalks overnight while waiting to withdraw their savings last week . Ohio Governor Richard Celeste finally stepped in and declared a three- day bank holiday for 71 savings and loan associations , probably the most extensive closure of U.S. financial institutions since the Great Depression . In Memphis , board of education officials were anxiously checking their investments . Elsewhere , communities from Beaumont , Texas , to Pompano Beach , Fla. , were badly shaken . <P> The rapidly growing storm was touched off by the March 4 collapse of E.S.M. Government Securities , a Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , dealer in bonds , notes and bills . The failure left dozens of creditors out as much as $300 million . E.S.M. had beguiled investors by offering high interest rates for short-term loans backed by U.S. Government securities . But some of E.S.M. 's customers never actually took possession of the securities , many of which now can not be found . <P> So far , Ohio has been hardest hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cincinnati 's Home State Savings Bank ( assets : $1.4 billion ) , which may have lost up to $150 million as an E.S.M. investor , was shuttered by state banking authorities after a run on its deposits . That triggered a statewide panic when depositors at other thrifts , which had no dealings with E.S.M. , rushed to withdraw their money , fearing that their savings were in jeopardy . At mid-week , the Ohio legislature created a $90 mil- lion emergency fund to supplement insurance for the savings and loan associations , but even that soon seemed inadequate in the face of mounting withdrawals . When he declared the bank holiday on Friday , Celeste explained that legislators and federal and state banking officials were working round the clock to formulate a plan to restore confidence in Ohio 's financial institutions . <P> Questions were also raised about the involvement in the E.S.M. failure of Marvin Warner , Home State 's owner and a U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland during Jimmy Carter 's presidency . Warner , a major investor in the Florida firm and an owner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own holdings in E.S.M. in January . Yet he insists , " I am one of the biggest victims . " Last week Warner resigned from his powerful position as chairman of the Ohio Building Authority in the wake of the Home State closing .
