Detroit 's two dailies are locked in a struggle for survival <P> At the counter of the Anchor Bar , a shadowy grease pit midway between the offices of the Detroit News and the rival Free Press , where journalists mingle in the legendary camaraderie of the trade , a Free Press employee looks up at rows of photographs of Motor City reporters , lawmen and politicians and says , " I think you have to be dead to be up there . " That is certainly true of one picture ; it shows a building that once housed the Detroit Times , a Hearst daily that shut down in 1960 and threw the city 's two surviving papers into a decades-long , unresolved and unfriendly battle for dominance . <P> The newspaper war in Detroit may be the nation 's hardest fought , and it is almost certainly the costliest . Detroit is the nation 's fifth largest metropolitan area ( pop . 4.4 million ) ; its News and Free Press are the ninth and tenth largest U.S. dailies . The owners of the morning Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $9 million last year . They assert that the all-day competitor , the News ( circ. 643,000 ) , lost twice that much in 1982 , even though it has a solid 60%-to-40% lead in advertising linage , largely because the News offers discounted ad and circulation rates . News executives decline to comment . Losses have accelerated during the recession and the deep slump in the auto industry , which have subjected Michigan to an unemployment rate of 17.6% , the nation 's highest . <P> Both papers believe that they are locked in a struggle for nothing less than survival . Moreover , says Free Press Executive Editor David Lawrence , 40 , " the victor would be highly profitable . " As a result , the News and the Free Press raid each other 's staffs , scoff at or steal each other 's stories , even copy each other 's promotional gimmicks . When the Free Press started handing out copies to breakfasters at McDonald 's , the News arranged a giveaway deal with Burger Chef . <P> Executives of the two papers display little of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Giles , 55 , calls the featurish Free Press " superficial , flighty and frilly . " Lawrence says that Giles ' paper , which earnestly stresses hard news , is " dull , bland and less complete than the Free Press . " Giles and Lawrence live just a block away from each other in suburban Grosse Pointe Park , but as Lawrence dryly observes , " We have certainly not had the opportunity to become close friends .
