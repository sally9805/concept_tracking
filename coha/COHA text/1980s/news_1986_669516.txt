// DEAR MR . CORP : // You may have thought this was your paycheck , MR . CORP . Well , truthfully , I have to level with you in all candor and honesty . Our staff of highly skilled artists designed the envelope you have just opened to match your payroll department ' s envelopes . Why , you may ask , MR . CORP , did we do this ? // Well , candidly , if any other marketing department had used such a device , we would have thought they were straying from the high ethical standards of our industry . We did it , in all honesty , because we are convinced we can offer you one of the greatest products , MR . CORP , to ever come your way . We are so convinced you and MRS . CORP and all the LITTLE CORPS will think so too that we knew you wouldn ' t mind not finding your weekly paycheck inside. // // We are so convinced , in short , that you will agree you have never seen anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours for practically nothing - that we are offering you a can ' t lose proposition - if you act fast. // ' ' What , ' ' MRS . CORP may be asking right now as she looks over your shoulder , ' ' what do we have to do , AMALG HONEY , in order to start our lifetime course ? How can you , dear , and our wonderful LITTLE CORPS be the first in our neighborhood to know how to repair our VCR ? ' ' // Your wife is perceptive . She gets right to the important question. // Well , let me answer frankly and honestly . What you have to do is so very very simple . Just remove the sticker at the top of the page that says I ACCEPT YOUR ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OFFER and apply it to the blank square next to your signature and charge card number at the bottom of the page . Then pop it in the enclosed envelope and drop it in the nearest mail slot . That ' s all you have to do. // Then sit back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope that looks like your paycheck , which contains the first volume of your lifetime course and a bill for just $49. 98 for your first installment . Then , as you and MRS . CORP and the LITTLE CORPS learn to dismantle your VCR and begin to earn big money taking apart your neighbors ' VCRs , you will receive new volumes each month for the next 84 months . Just continue to pay the low monthly payment of $39. 98 and you will see a whole new world of electronics , computeronics , cybernetics , robotics , tapetics , movietics , cinematics , filmology , 64K chips , chocolate chips , programmabletics , remote control disassembly , fastforwardonics , and oh so many other hi-tech subjects unveiled before your very eyes. // Your kids will cease to be lethargic and surly . They will soon begin to study videonics all through the night , improve their class standing , score higher on SATs , outhit the neighbors ' kids in Little League , wait eagerly for next month ' s volume , eat all their Brussels sprouts , receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , most important , the LITTLE CORPS will learn a skill that will always be in demand , a skill with which they can earn big money to send you checks when you have retired. // Just think ! When you affix the sticker right now , you can sit back and say to yourself ' ' AMALG CORP , for once in your life you made a really smart move . ' ' You can bask in the admiration MRS . CORP and each JUNIOR CORP will start giving you the minute they open the first volume. // And you have nothing to lose . If at any time you are less than fully satisfied with this ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OFFER , just put the latest volume back in its paycheck envelope , pop some postage on the outside , and mail it back to me . I will cheerfully refund your last payment and stop the course . No questions asked . You ' re the boss . Then you and MRS . CORP can start picking up the 64K RAM chips and automatic drive gears scattered around the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them to come pick up whatever parts of their VCRs can be found under the cushions in the family room sofa . You can write notes to teachers telling them why the LITTLE CORPS are no longer doing their homework . You can feel happy for some other surprised parents who will be getting a letter about the law school scholarship that has just become available to them. // And of course you , MR . CORP , can start learning to live with the silent reproach and sullen stares that your wife and the kids direct at you during the course of the next 40 years. // But let ' s not waste time on this unlikely picture . In all honesty , MR . CORP , I feel that you and your little family are uniquely qualified to make use of this fine course . It ' s the same one that many TV sitcom stars and game show hosts studied to repair their own VCRs . And it ' s yours , candidly , right now if you will just lift that little sticker. // Yours frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mail Salvage Corp. // // Amalgamated Conglomerate Corp. // 1200 Champs Elysees Drive // Condo Gorge , AR 000022 // ATTENTION : Director of Purchasing // // DEAR MR .
