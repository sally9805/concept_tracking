THE FORMULA Directed by John Avildsen Screenplay by Steve Shagan <P> " Is that him ? " " Naw , ca n't be . " " Sure it is . Listen . " " By golly , I think you 're right . " <P> Once Marlon Brando 's disguise has been penetrated and the great eccentric has been identified , such suspense as The Formula manages to generate comes to an abrupt and early end , though whatever fun and frolic the film offers depends solely on his occasional presence as the comically menacing leader of an oil cartel . Perhaps one should say the oil cartel . The movie traffics heavily in this kind of simple-minded paranoia . It insists that evil lurks in a single all-powerful force possessing the power to warp men 's minds , condition their behavior and , of course , bump them off wherever they live in the world and whenever , over the course of many years , it suits the conspiracy 's purpose . <P> For the record , Brando is the character wearing granny glasses and a hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunningly around a large bald spot and whose corpulence is encased in a wardrobe that seems to have been picked up at a thrift sale managed by the estate of Charles Foster Kane . Brando has also got himself up with a down-home country-boy accent that makes his cynicism terribly appealing-especially in the bloody and lugubrious context of this emotionally unpunctuated movie . His performance is not truly good-it lacks a real edge of sharpness-but it is often funny , a kind of comment on the heavy-handedness of the film . <P> The title formula is for a synthetic fuel invented by Nazi scientists . The conceit is that it has been kept off the market since World War II by the oil interests in order to keep up the price of crude . A sometime Los Angeles cop and his wife are killed when it looks as if they are about to go public with the secret . The search for their killers-and the precious equations they were killed for-leads Detective George C. Scott to Germany and Switzerland and to involvement not only with remnants of the Third Reich but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is assigned to seduce and then betray Scott . <P> It is all terribly convoluted , but not especially interesting ; John Avildsen 's direction alternates between flatness and strain . Scott gives an imitation of his old force , but there is a lack of conviction in his playing that is , perhaps , understandable . If he is going to make this kind of film , he should learn from Brando how to take the money and hide out behind the makeup . As for Keller , she is just impossible , an actress whose monotony of tone dims everything she touches . <P> Like so many movies and books that try to graft topical subject matter onto the obsessive mass-market interest in the Nazi past . The Formula requires too much exposition . By the time all the improbable explanations for its linkages between a fast-receding past and today 's headlines have been laid out , all the false trails explored , the action lies buried under a pile of verbiage . It used to be that detective stories were lean and laconic . The attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thought to be big subjects is ruining them . They really must get back to their Bogartian basics . - By Richard Schickel
