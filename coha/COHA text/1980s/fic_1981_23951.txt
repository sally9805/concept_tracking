ARBOR DAY A short story by T. N. R. Rogers m Y SISTER has decided to become a writer . Now that she is fifty and her five girls are all grown , she says she is finally getting around to doing some of the things she has always wanted to do . She says she realizes that her husband , Pork , has been keeping her in bondage for thirty years  --  and so insidiously that she was never aware of it . Now she is freeing herself . She is teaching Crafts and Edible Wild Plants clown at the nature center , she is taking whitewater kayak lessons , and last year she went on a balloon expedition in Manassas . She is talking of climbing mountains , of exploring caves , of diving into shipwrecks and coral reefs , of sailing alone across the Pacific . All these experiences , she tells us , will he grist for the writer 's mill . Her story is going to be called " Arbor Day . " It came to her in a flash when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the story the girls will come across a severed human hand when they dig a hole for a seedling . In another hole they will come across a foot , and in another a rib or two . Suddenly everybody will remember how McTavish , a thirty-year civil servant , disappeared six months before , and how his wife had been strangely jubilant at the time . We all laugh . Cissie 's laughter is the loudest and brightest of all . " That story sounds awfully familiar , " I tell her . " It is n't going to be me who murders Pork , " she says . " It 'll be one of those kids he 's taking into that precious house of his . Probably Holly 's boyfriend  --  he 's got a murderous streak in him , no doubt about it . He 's knocked her around a few times , anyway . " " Oh darling , " my mother says . " He has ? " " Does n't sound like the sort of person you want hanging around your daughter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out , and Cissie is already expounding on the vengeance that will overtake Pork . Pork will ask Holly 's boyfriend to do something , per-haps to flush the toilet ( another failing of Holly 's boyfriend , other than being murderous , is that he has never learned to flush the toilet ) , and Holly 's boyfriend will split Pork 's head open with an ax . If an ax is not available , he will knock Pork down the stairs and break his neck . Cissie laughs at this . It sounds like an improbable scenario , but these days , who knows ? We are sitting in the cramped living room of my parents ' tiny apartment in Washington . They live in a dilapidated brick building halfway between the public housing . from which even now we can hear shouts and loud music and laughter , and the expensive waterfront high-rises . Four blocks from the Potomac ; that was the only advantage of the place , but now , after Mary 's operation and Bart 's series of strokes , they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these few tiny rooms are the impedimenta and tangible remembrances of my parents ' conjoined lives : the walls are covered with Mary 's paintings , and a shelf of one of the bookcases is devoted to Bart 's books . They have been married for fifty-five years , and for longer than that he has been a writer . Now , gathering dust beside his typewriter in the far corner of the room , there is a stack of 250 pages of a novel he was rewriting when he had his had stroke almost a year ago . He had eighty or ninety pages to go , and all through his slow recuperation he has had those pages in mind . But he has not been able to type . His fingers can not seem to hit the correct keys : he believes that that is the problem , and that as soon as he regains the proper use of his fingers he will be able to get the writing done . As soon as he gets it done he will embark on a new novel , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the words flow and stop in little bursts , like rusty water from defective plumbing he tries to tell me about that book . He believes it will be his finest . It is a book I would like to read , a book I would like to pass on to my son . But Bart has stopped talking . He puts his hands up to his head , clutching at his skull as if to take hold of the ideas bottled up in there and bring them out into the open . All that he has in there  --  it is bottled up forever . Cissie 's cigarettes are getting to me , and I jerk one of the windows open . After the rain it is cool out , and there is a refreshing smell from the lilacs Mary planted six or eight years ago . Cissie is going on and on , about her husband who does not know the meaning of joy and about her daughters whom she nurtured in her bosom but who have turned out to be as thankless as vipers . I turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really my sister ? This laughing , melodramatic woman  --  is this who Cissie has become ? I DROVE IN this afternoon , on my way from Provincetown . Tomorrow I will continue on toward Iowa , where I have a house and where my son , Eric , lives with the woman who used to be my wife . Washington was a detour , but it might have been the last time I see Bart . The highway seemed to fill me with words . The words were not for my father . I had never really talked to my father ; my role in his life , I learned a long time ago , was to be a listener , a sounding board . He would listen now , in the wake of his strokes , his own torrential voice gone bubbly and full of rust , to whatever I might say . But I had never learned to talk to him . The words were for Eric . I have not seen him for six months , and some days , out on the whale-watching boat or alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of my unspoken words for him , the observations , the admonitions , the words of love . On the highway , the words seemed to take shape . They seemed to he forming themselves into something so important that I thought that I would sit down and write Eric a letter as soon as I reached my parents ' place , even though he does not read yet and even though the letter would not reach Iowa as soon as I would . But what was it that I wanted to say ? The message seemed to keep changing . There was a great deal of change in the air . In Massachusetts the trees were still bare , and under the heavy wind and rain the land through which I drove seemed autumnal rather than vernal . On the Jersey Turnpike the day suddenly opened up : behind me the sky was black with clouds , and ahead it was blue and cloudless ; the highway and fields still sparkled from the rain , and the trees were thick with fresh greenery and flowers . Not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the turnpike at midnight and slept in the front seat , under a blinking neon sign , till dawn . It was an all-night station . When I awoke and went into the station , the night-shift man who had towed me in was having a cup of coffee with the day men , who had just arrived . He was talking about a car he had towed from the highway after a terrible crash late at night ; it had jumped the barricade and smashed head-on into another car . One of the men who had just come in looked up from his coffee with a bored expression and said , " Who bought lunch ? " " The two kids in that car , " the night man said , " and one man in the other car . He was sliced all up with broken glass . They tried to stop the bleeding , but it was coming out in too many places ; they just did n't have enough hands . " And somehow I wanted to tell Eric about that , too , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does to other living things , and when it comes it is not even hallowed . It is a matter of twisted metal and broken glass , a matter of bored talk over morning coffee by men who will not even speak of it by its rightful name : over the rims of their paper cups , yawning , they ask one another who bought lunch last night . And then what ? When the mechanic came in he found that the starter needed to be replaced . A simple job , but it cost more money than I had . I would have to get somebody to wire me the $50 I did not have . So I called Phyllis and told her what had happened . " I do n't know if the bank is open , " she said . " Where am I supposed to get fifty dollars ? " " The bank is open . " " This is Saturday , you know . " " It 's open till twelve . That gives you two hours , right ? " In the background I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand over the phone and said something to him I could not hear . " Ca n't you get your brother to do it ? " she said . " I guess I could . I can , yes . " It hurt me that she should ask . My brother had done things for us so many times that I did not like to ask him for anything more . Once when we were stuck in upper Michigan he wired us $300 to have our engine replaced . Now I dialed his number to ask a favor once again , but there was n't any answer . I hesitated a few minutes , but I could think of no one else . So I called Phyllis back . " I do n't even know if there 's a telegraph office in town , " she said . I closed my eyes and waited , saying nothing . " The closest office may be Cedar Rapids . I may have to drive to Cedar Rapids . " " Will you please do this for me ? " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . The work has already been done . I ca n't get out of here without the money . " " It 's raining here , " Phyllis said . Her voice sounded wistful . I knew by her tone that she had decided to help me . " Well , I 'll see what I can do , " she said at last . Three hours later the money came through , and I was on my way . But I was still hurt by Phyllis 's unwillingness to do something that seemed to require nothing of her but simple decency or kindness . It did not require love ; it did not require her to give of herself . I had always tried to do what I could for Phyllis . I had always tried to be kind . B EFORE CISSIE stopped by , I sat and listened to my father stumbling over his words , trying to say to me , perhaps for the last time , the things he felt were important . They were things I had heard many times before . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how he got paid less than he should have for one story or another , how we would not have lost the house in Dobbs Ferry if he had been able to get back into the army for World War II . I have heard these things before , all of them , but there is one thing that is new . He is trying to sue his publisher , but he is not satisfied with the young lawyer he engaged . The lawyer reported that he might be able to get a settlement of $300 , but my father believes he should be able to get $30,000 . He believes his stroke last year was caused by his worries about the publisher 's apparent breach of contract . The publisher refuses to take him seriously  --  that is the most painful thing of all . The publisher knows he is an old man and supposes , correctly , that when he dies his heirs will drop the suit . Bart does n't want the money for himself ; since goini , on social security , he and Mary have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for his children . Of course , none of us needs the money now . He is thinking of twenty and thirty and forty years ago , when we had to do without ; he would like to rewrite that part of our family history . Before he dies , he wants us to have the money for the roller skates and bikes we did not have , for new clothes , for two weeks at summer camp . " Do n't you remember how you wanted to go out to Colorado that summer ? " he said . " To tell you the truth , I completely forgot about that ! ' " It meant a lot to you , boy , at the time . " " As it turned out , I was happier to be at home that summer . " The old man can not tell anymore when I am lying . Still today in my subrational self I believe my whole life would have been happier if I had gone to Colorado that summer . But now Cissie is here , and she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indignant . Pork , she tells us , is trying to cut her off without a nickel . This phrase of hers strikes a chord in me . A long time ago , before she got married to Pork , she was married for less than a month to a fellow utterly devoid of redeeming qualities . One day Cissie showed up at Grams 's house with the complaint that Albie gave her only two cents a week . Two cents a week ! I was eight , and I was indignant . The adults gathered around her in conference . When Albie knocked at the door a little later I confronted him immediately . " How come you give Cissie only two cents a week ! " " Huh ? How about moving , kid ? I want my wife . " What a nice guy Pork seemed when she started going around with him . She loved him even after they got married . For years she was a terrific advocate of marriage and babies . Ten year ago , when I admitted some uncertainties about my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She got stars in her eyes and told me blissfully that I should give it a chance ; I would find , as she had , that everything got better and better . But now Cissie has forgotten all that . She goes back to how Pork lost his job . After thirty years as a maritime specialist with the Commerce Department and then the Transportation Department , he was fired because he disagreed with the new administration 's policies on shipping oil . " Supposedly because of that , " Cissie says now . " But actually it 's because he 's been an incurable neurotic for the past ten years . " This is something I have not heard before . Until recently , in telling us about his troubles at the office , she was furiously supportive . He was Horatius at the bridge . " Everybody knew he was neurotic , " she says . " It must have been perfect hell to work with him . Even the neighbors have known for years that he was neurotic . Jane Oliver 's mother calls him Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with him . And imagine ! " she says , turning to me and breathing her smoke straight into my face , " he calls me neurotic ! " I realize that Bart is not listening to Cissie . His eyes are not on her , but on me , and I have a sudden apprehension that he is seeing me as his future , seeing me as his hope , in some sense , for immortality . He is waiting for me to speak ; he is hoping for me to tell him what I have been doing and what is on my mind . But what can I say to my father now ? For all the years of my life he has tutored me in silence : I have become the one who listens . And now already I am looking toward my son for my own immortality . How can I tell Bart that ? How can I tell him anything ? He willnever know me , now , no matter what I say . A son may know his father  --  already Eric seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever know his son ? A S SOON AS I came in this afternoon , Mary filled me in on Cissie 's problems . Cissie 's problems are marital problems . On Easter Sunday , Pork gave Cissie the loveliest card you would ever hope to see , satin and scented and sentimental , " To the only woman I have ever loved . " The next day his lawyer got in touch with her and told her he was filing for divorce . The grounds were incompatibility and two counts of adultery , which Cissie denies absolutely . Cissie is furious at Pork for having given her that message of love the very day before filing for divorce . She is extremely upset . What upsets her the most is that for weeks she was preparing to ask for a separation . Pork beat her to the punch . She is upset , too , because she feels aba- ndoned by her children . She feels that all of them except the youngest are siding unfairly with Pork . There are five girls , and for years they seemed very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youngest is still in high school , but in recent years the middle three have adopted a mock-hippie life style , living with a group of pimply freaks , in a house where plaster rains from the ceiling . Cissie , as she approached fifty , thought she was one of them since she was young at heart . She became the Nippiest of all . She would show up at their communal house at three in the morning with a gallon of wine or half an ounce of marijuana ; she would want them to wake up , to bay at the moon . to come out and fly a kite , or perhaps to dance naked under the arc lights in Lafayette Park . " Why , Mom ? " they said . Now the whole lot of them have been evicted , and the three girls have decided to move back into their parents ' house . They want to have their boyfriends move in with them . Pork has always been rather stodgy about such matters , but this time he called a family council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Supreme Arbiter . The girls voted unanimously to have their boyfriends move in , so Pork went along ? " simply to spite me , " Cissie says . Now they have all moved in or are moving in . It 's a big house ; there are rooms enough for all of them . Cissie is still living there , too , afraid that if she leaves before the divorce goes through she will be charged with abandonment . She moved out of the master bedroom six months ago , telling everybody in
