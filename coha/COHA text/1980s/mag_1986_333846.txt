A brother and sister leave home to wander through a place where exotic figures have the power to enchant and destroy . But the siblings are protected by an even greater force : goodness . At the end of a winding and hazardous journey , the wicked are vanquished and the children are redeemed . <P> This Christmas the pair may be called He-Man and She-Ra , and their blond manes and mesomorphic torsos beckon from shelves in nearly every toy store in the nation . In other times the wandering children have been differently named and more modestly dressed . Observes Roger Sale , a professor of English at the University of Washington : " A girl is in a wood . Give her a brother , and one has Hansel and Gretel . . . send the girl to dwarfs , and one has Snow White . Make the girl a boy , and one might have Jack , either the one who climbs beanstalks or the one who kills giants . " Make the wood the reaches of space , and they are Princess Leia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> For the past eleven months , toy manufacturers have dangled fresh enticements - before small children , hoping for the greatest separation of them all : the parents from their wallets . More interested in the here-and-now bottom line than in fairy tales or the mythic wellsprings behind children 's play , the marketers have long since phased out the elves in Santa 's workshop ( and kicked the old gentleman upstairs to his present role as the Colonel Sanders of the Yuletide franchise ) . Big business , after all , is not kid stuff ; the other way round is more like it . In the U.S. last Christmas , according to the ledgers of the Wall Street Journal , " the average household bought 30 gifts and spent $315 . " In 1985 $12 billion worth of toys were sold at retail , 60% of them in the three months before Dec. 25 . That was a sparkling $1 billion more than the previous year . This year it is expected to be 5% higher . <P> No child fights more single-mindedly for a toy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that market . At Mattel , the second largest toy company , with sales of just over $l billion , guards patrol the R &D; building in Hawthorne , Calif. , as if it were a Strategic Air Command base . Understandably . A successful new product can mean buckets of the stuff that grown-ups ' dreams are made of . Coleco came charging out of the Cabbage Patch with its pathetic but lovable doll , and currently ranks third , with annual sales of more than $500 million . Hasbro , the leader , with $1.3 billion in sales projected for this year , is considered the industry hotshot . Every year some 4,000 new products soar and roar out of the factories in hopes of finding a place under the nation 's Christmas trees .
