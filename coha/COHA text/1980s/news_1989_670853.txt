At one time it was known as the capital of black America , a place that , despite its poverty , was still a glittering magnet for writers , artists and entertainers. // More recently , though , Harlem has seen crack and despair settle over it like the soot of an arson fire. // Through good times and bad , however , the Manhattan neighborhood has remained a center of black politics in New York City . It has produced a string of prominent black elected officials but never a mayor. // Now one of its own , David N. Dinkins , could win City Hall in less than two weeks and Harlem is aglow with pride and anticipation. // Mr. Dinkins ' s red , blue , green and white campaign buttons are pinned to countless lapels and caps in Harlem . " There ' s no question I feel proud , " said Eric Matthews , a 31-year-old track worker for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority . " He ' s one of us . It ' s going to go down in history. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rudolph W. Giuliani , and many people in Harlem flash a look of disgust. // Ethnic solidarity no doubt plays a large role in the reaction . But party loyalty is important . Black people have voted overwhelmingly Democratic for 50 years. // Indeed , finding a Republican in Harlem is almost as hard as finding a street paved with gold . " Giuliani don ' t care nothing about poor people , " said Albert Crumes , 31 , an unemployed construction worker . " He ' s a Republican . We need somebody in office who is going to speak for us . " <> <> Opposition Overwhelmed // Mr. Dinkins , Harlem residents , politicians , and community advocates said in recent interviews , is that voice. // They listened to Mr. Dinkins ' s message during the Democratic primary in September . He overwhelmed his opposition in the 70th Assembly District , which includes central Harlem , by polling 21 , 740 votes to 1 , 279 for his closest rival , Mayor Edward I. Koch. // The recent uproar over how he handled his personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the candidate spent much of his boyhood. // " That ' s not of any interest to me , " said Gertie Green , 59 , a retired nurse . " Picking on that petty stuff is a way to keep away from talking about the issues . " <> <> Overrun by Problems // " What we want , " she added , stabbing the warm afternoon air with her cigarette , " is somebody to clean up the streets . We have a lot of real problems . You name it and we got it . " Dr. James L. Curtis , director of psychiatry at the Harlem Hospital Center , said a community famous for its shining cultural renaissance in the 1920 ' s has been overrun in the 1980 ' s by crack addiction , infant mortality and AIDS. // Central Harlem has one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the nation. // About 1 , 500 patients at the hospital and its various clinics are receiving methadone for their heroin habits , and heroin ' s impact on Harlem , a major problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crack , the doctor said. // " The insurgence of crack made its first stop in Harlem , " David A. Paterson , the community ' s state senator , said . " This was the epicenter of the epidemic . " <> <> Years of Disappointment // Poverty , Dr. Curtis said , invaded Harlem long ago and it appears to be getting worse. // " Demoralization , depression and despair are widespread , " he said . " But I think there is a strong feeling of hopefulness inspired by Dinkins ' s candidacy , hope that he will provide a fresh and strong leadership. " // But any hope is tempered by years of disappointment , said Jerry Hendrix , 36 , a lifelong resident of Harlem. // " There ' s a lot of tension and frustration , " he said . " We ' re tired of promises . As you can plainly see , some of our biggest problems are unemployment and housing. " // He swept his hand toward a knot of young able-bodied men talking on the corner of 125th Street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had few places to go except the next corner . " Since the presidency of Reagan , this country has really been bad , " he said . " Reagan sold this country out . Giuliani falls under the same umbrella . " <> <> Streets of ' Entrepreneurs ' // Asked about the controversy surrounding Mr. Dinkins ' s transfer of stock to his son , David Jr . , Mr. Hendrix said it was a non-issue. // " It ' s all part of the muck the Republicans is trying to stir up , " he said . " This is how I look at it : All have sinned and fallen short of the glory. " // Nearby , two signs were taped to a lamp post , illustrating the war between despair and hope raging through the streets . " Women Can Get AIDS Too , " one warned . " A Thanksgiving Weekend Gospel Extravaganza , " the other , taped just above it , read. // An old man , his back bent , his rough hands filled with knit caps he hoped to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dollar , a dollar. " // Earl Holt , 47 , said the old man was part of a growing army of " entrepreneurs , " who roam the streets selling whatever they can to survive . " This is how he gets food , " Mr. Holt said , pointing to the old man . " He ' ll do the same thing tomorrow and the next day. " // Mr. Holt , who has been unemployed for five years , said he too is a solider in the army of hustlers . " This is the pits , " he said . " Harlem U.S.A. You have to hustle to survive . Pekple are walking around here like zombies . That ' s why I ' m for Dinkins . It ' s time for a change . Most of the people I see coming through here are depressed. " // " They ' ve had a foot on their necks so long they don ' t know what to do , " he said . " If he gets into office he will make a change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // A few blocks away , Guy Wellington , 29 , kept one eye on his wash in a laundry and the other on his son , Andrew , 3 , who was playing on the sun-soaked sidewalk . Mr. Wellington , who spent nine years in the Navy , grew up in Harlem and returned only last year . He said a major issue is child care. // He said he worries about his son all the time . The streets of Harlem , he said , can swallow up a child ' s dreams in the blink of an eye . <> <> Talk of Issues // " We got drugs on mostly every corner , " Mr. Wellington said . " If one crack house gets torn down , another grows next door. " // Mr. Wellington said he had not decided yet who he would support on Nov. 7 . He said as the spring turned into summer , he had been impressed with Mr. Giuliani ' s reputation as a " crime buster. " // " I ' m leaning towards Dinkins now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . All Giuliani is worried about is talking about Dinkins . But both of them are pointing fingers at each other . That ' s not going to make it . It disgusts me that they ' re not talking about the issues more. " // Dolores Jones , 30 , a theatrical wardrobe assistant , stood waiting for a cab in front of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at 135th Street and Lenox Avenue. // " I ' ve chosen to support David Dinkins , " she said . " He ' s been in the community . He ' s walked the streets . I like his views. " // Ms. Jones said drugs and education are crucial issues for Harlem . " Our children are being miseducated , " she said . " And for every junkie that gets help , 10 more children are recruited . But David Dinkins will give our children another positive role model. " // Despite its problems , there is a spirit and bounce to Harlem ' s step that refuses to be hobbled. // The writer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he arrived in Harlem in 1924 from Los Angeles . He wrote about Harlem ' s broad avenues , its bright lights , and a warm sea of people that swept him away. // " I looked over the rooftops of Negrodom and tried to believe my eyes , " he wrote . " What a city . What a world. " // Today , Harlem ' s wide avenues have been renamed for black heroes : Malcolm X , Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . , Adam Clayton Powell Jr . , Frederick Douglass. // Along 125th Street and on a half-dozen street corners , open-air book stands are often set up , offering a steady diet of books on black history and culture. // " So people know that we have a lot to be proud of , " Mr. Holt said. // The Apollo Theater , where countless black entertainment stars first began their climb , has been brought back to life .
