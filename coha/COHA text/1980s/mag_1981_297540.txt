Sam Cummings is a large , loquacious , twinkly man who is never very far from a joke or an ironic aside . " Human folly , " he says , " guarantees the perpetuity of arms trading , the second-oldest profession in the world . " Cummings , 54 , is intimate with this deadly folly : he is by far the largest private arms seller in the world . Interarms Corp. , which he founded 28 years ago and wholly owns today , has 250 employees in Britain , Panama , Monaco , Argentina and the U.S. Sales in a good year can top $ 100 million . On the world arms market , that sum is a trifle , as Cummings is quick to note : " Let 's be honest , the only arms dealers that really matter are the governments . " Yet when governments or retailers ( or shadier entities ) want light arms - pistols , rifles , machine guns and the like - they most often come to Cummings . <P> " Arms , " he says , " have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at age five , Sam Cummings , the son of a Philadelphia Main Line family , found an old German machine gun behind the local American Legion post and dragged it home . He rebuilt the gun and started collecting others . As a student on a term abroad at Oxford University , Cummings toured the armament-strewn battlefields of Europe , and there resolved to become a weapons dealer . Between college ( George Washington University ) and achieving his vocation , he spent three years working for the CIA , identifying guns captured during the Korean War . <P> " My first deal , " Cummings told TIME 'S Robert Kroon in London last week , " was with the Panamaniau government . <P> The chief of the national guard showed me a collection of about 7,000 old weapons straight out of the cavern of Ali Baba . He wanted Browning light machine guns , which I managed to get out of Canadian surplus stocks , and we clinched the deal .

Unremarkable , too , Cummings claims , is his business : " Like any other trade , " he says . " We do n't sell anything without official British or American export licenses . I am not a gun runner . " Cummings regrets the U.S. ban on arms sales to Iran ( " lost business " ) . <P> Says he : " We wo n't do anything surreptitiously . <P> I do n't deal with Ahmed the Betrayer or Mahboob the Redbeard , unless they are documented by their governments .
