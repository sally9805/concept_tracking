The case is believed to be the first in the nation in which a party in a matrimonial and custody proceeding has sought to compel the other party to submit to such a test. // The biochemical technique , called radioimmunoassay , can detect traces of cocaine in hair . Although suspects in some criminal cases have been required to provide physical evidence , such as blood and hair samples , the evidence has usually been tested with other processes. // But Dr. Frederick Paul Smith , an associate professor of forensic science at the University of Alabama in Birmingham , said yesterday that radioimmunoassay test findings involving hair and drugs had figured in some criminal cases , including a sexual-assault prosecution in which he had testified in Alaska in 1982 . Dr. Smith , a member of the university ' s Department of Criminal Justice , was retained in the Scarsdale case by lawyers for the woman ' s husband. // Radioimmunoassay is based on the theory that cocaine fossilizes in a user ' s hair and that as the hair grows , it can provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can detect the presence of extremely minute amounts of a substance - in this case , a chemical derivative of cocaine - through a process combining radiation and antibodies . <> <> Hair Provides a ' Chronology ' // Dr. Smith said last night from his home in Birmingham , Ala. , that radioimmunoassay , when applied to human hair , provides " a chronology of the traces of a chemical in a person ' s hair that gives us a history of the presence of that chemical . " The technique can detect substances in amounts one-millionth the size that can be found by other chemical or bioassay tests. // While the case has been under appeal , the woman , Ninni Burgel , 37 years old , has been under a court order preventing her from cutting or chemically treating her hair , which is now below her shoulders , because the hair could contain evidence. // The hair-testing had been requested by her husband , Frank Burgel , a 40-year-old businessman , as part of a pretrial " discovery " process . Mr. Burgel , who is seeking custody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has charged that his wife has engaged , since 1982 , in a continuing and uncontrollable pattern of cocaine use that raises doubts about her fitness as a custodial parent . The Burgels have been married 13 years. // Mrs. Burgel , the dissenting opinion said , conceded that she had engaged in occasional , social use of cocaine in the past with her husband , but maintaiuned that she had ceased all use some time ago. // In an affidavit submitted to the court , Mr. Burgel said he had removed specimens of his wife ' s hair from the drains of a sink and a bathtub she had used and had sent them to Dr. Smith for testing . <> <> Hair Analyzed Like Tree Rings // An affidavit submitted by Dr. Smith in November 1987 showed that radioimmunoassay analysis of the hair specimens revealed " high , off-scale readings of cocaine or cocaine-related substances . " But he said he could not confirm the results through other tests because the samples submitted were not large enough . He said he would need two larger samples , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some scientists consider radioimmunoassay valuable in detecting long-term use of drugs . Conventional urine tests can generally determine the presence of drugs only for a limited period . But as hair grows , it retains the traces of a drug and can be analyzed almost like tree rings to determine when the drug was last used. // In one study , recounted in a scientific journal , hair was taken from former cocaine addicts who had not used the drug for several months . The shorter hairs tested negative for cocaine ; the longer hairs tested positive. // But the technique is not without its critics . Mrs. Burgel ' s lawyers , for example , submitted statements from their own experts that the test was unreliable . <> <> A Decision Left to Trial Judge // The majority ruling in the Scarsdale case granted Mr. Burgel ' s request to compel Mrs. Burgel to allow a physician to take the necessary hair samples. // The 3-to-2 ruling , which upheld a decision last December by Justice John C. Marbach , was handed down Monday by the Appellate Division of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority opinion , written by Justice Vincent R. Balletta Jr. , pointed out that the appeals court was expressing " no opinion on whether the test results would be admissible " in the divorce proceeding , a decision that rests on the trial judge . However , it added , even if the test information was not admissible , it could " lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. " // In the minority opinion , the dissenting justices described radioimmunoassay as a " novel and unproven " process . They said the matter should be referred to the lower court " for an immediate hearing to determine whether the proposed testing procedure will yield valid and reliable results . " <> <> Case Is Described as Unique // In the dissenting opinion , Justice Thomas R. Sullivan said he could not join in the majority ' s view that the wife " may be compelled to submit to the physically intrusive procedure " that had been proposed . " Our courts , " he said , " can not compel litigants to become unwilling participants in wholly experimental exercises. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Balletta ' s majority opinion . Justice Sybil Hart Kooper concurred with the dissent. // Lawyers for both the husband and wife said yesterday that the case was unique. // Peter E. Bronstein , a lawyer for the husband , said that his client was " very happy that the court has recognized the importance of assuring that children are raised in a drug-free environment. " // Mr. Bronstein , who is with the Manhattan firm of Bronstein , Van Veen &; Bronstein , said that Mr. Burgel had voluntarily submitted to radioimmunoassay tests of his own hair and that the results had shown no trace of cocaine. // Sylvia Goldschmidt , a lawyer for Mrs. Burgel , said that no decision had been made on whether to appeal the Appellate Division ' s ruling to the Court of Appeals in Albany . Ms. Goldschmidt is with the firm of Ferraro Rogers Dranoff Greenbaum Goldstein &; Miller in Pearl River , N.Y. //
