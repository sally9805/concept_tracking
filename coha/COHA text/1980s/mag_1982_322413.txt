A dazzling exhibit sheds fresh light on Scandinavian modern <P> For smart newlyweds of a generation ago , their home , the first rung on the ladder of upward mobility , was almost inevitably furnished with " Danish modern , " complete with Marimekko textiles , stainless-steel cutlery and plain white tableware . There was no better way to show modernity . Recently , however , modern Scandinavian design seems to have vanished from public awareness in the U.S. Much of it has been poorly adapted and absorbed by U.S. mass culture . In addition , it is no longer modern to be modern . <P> " Scandinavian Modern : 1880-1980 , " the dazzling exhibition that opens this week at New York City 's Cooper-Hewitt Museum , hits us , therefore , like a massive surprise attack . Some 330 masterworks of furniture , ceramics , glass , metalwork and textiles show that Scandinavian design is not so much a style as a visual morality , a powerful force for beauty and meaning . Nor is the modern mode of Scandinavian design frozen into an abstract machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical and emotional needs . Seen in this context , Danish modern is fresh , exciting and timeless . Like Finnish Architect Alvar Aalto 's bentwood armchair ( circa 1929 ) or Norwegian Eystein Sandnes ' 1959 porcelain tableware , Danish modern transcends fashion . <P> The Cooper-Hewitt , which is the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of Design , has organized and displayed this exhibition with its usual flair . Scandinavian design , says the museum 's sumptuous exhibition catalogue ( published in hard cover by Harry N. Abrams , Inc. ; $45 ) , " scatters flowers before your feet and lays the pale colors and mild beauty of the Nordic summer before your eyes . Less apparent is the truth that this sunny effect is achieved against a background of darkness , cold , ice and snow . " <P> This " winter design " gives the domestic furnishings of Iceland , Denmark , Norway , Sweden and Finland a common quality . It is a painstaking , brooding , almost mystical devotion to perfection in craftsmanship and thoughtfulness in art . The effort is focused on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to focus on . Says Cooper-Hewitt Curator of Decorative Arts David Revere McFadden , who organized the show : " Whether they are made by hand or machine , Scandinavia 's virtuoso designs are both art and craft . Distinction between the two would merely spoil our joy of appreciating them . " <P> One of the principal sources of Scandinavian design is Viking art . Viking revival artifacts , like the carved and painted turn-of-the-century dragon chair of Norway 's Gerhard Munthe , mark the beginning of a specifically Scandinavian arts and crafts movement . The world first became aware of it when Scandinavian textiles , porcelains , furniture and architecture were shown at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 in Paris . <P> Since then , Nordic designers have given every European style their distinct mark . Denmark 's Georg Jensen 's silver and opal Dragonfly brooch ( 1904 ) and fellow Dane Erik Magnussen 's Grasshopper brooch ( 1907 ) of silver and coral are unmistakably art nouveau . They are also unmistakably Scandinavian . Like virtually all the objects in this exhibition , they show the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is what Frank Lloyd Wright called " organic " design .
