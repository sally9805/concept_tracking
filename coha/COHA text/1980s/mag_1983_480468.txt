landscape of letters , rather than a notable figure moving through it , despite the fact that he has published internationally more than fifteen novels , several volumes of stories , several volumes of literary and political commentary , and a volume of plays . In part this alteration is due to the sheer length of his career ; few artists can work for over half a century and hold a public 's undiminished attention , especially in an age that , whatever the quality of its new artists , attaches value to novelty itself . In part this shift of attention has occurred because the reading world has come to expect a familiar Moravia tone ? prototypStanley Kauffmann is film critic for the New Republic . ical twentieth-century pessimism . astringent yet humane ? which he has purposefully cultivated , " I never trust a writer who can say too many things , " he told an interviewer in 1955 . " By that I mean a writer who has too many tunes to play . One good tune is enough . Good writers are monotonous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the one problem they were born to understand . " Precisely for all these reasons , his forthcoming novel , 1934 , prompts another look at this immensely fertile author , his constancies and his paradoxes , whose greatest paradox is that , in what may be his closing work . he presents a tonal surprise , a new " good tune . " Correlation between an artist 's biography and his work can be facile or delusory , but with Moravia it is to some degree necessary . One simply can not disregard the effect on HARPER'S/ APRIL 1983 64 his writing of his family background , his early illness , and the political climate of Italy . He was born in 1907 , to a family in comfortable circumstances . His father was an architect , a Venetian Jew who married a Dalmatian countess and moved to Rome . The boy was baptized and reared as a Catholic , but , he says , " my father was an atheist . " The father 's views seem to have prevailed . Because Moravia was a sickly child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grammar school diploma . He developed tuberculosis of the bone and " spent , altogether , five years in bed with it , between the ages of nine and seventeen . " He still limps . Inevitably , this seclusion and inactivity affected him . They fed an appetite for reading , which carried him to a precocious knowledge of literature and languages , and they may be said to have touched his view of subsequent experience . In much of his work , even in the erotic scenes for which he is famous , a seignorial eye seems to be watching , the eye of one whom life approaches , rather than the reverse . This is not remotely to say that his work lacks emotional heat , but that the man who looks at these characters seems not only to see them truthfully ; he also sees the curve of the earth and the stretch of time behind them . H E BEGAN his first novel , The Time of Indifference , in 1925 , when he was eighteen . It was published in 1929 at his - own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book had " one of the greatest successes in all modern Italian literature .... I may add that nothing approaching it has happened to me since ? or , for that matter , to anyone else . " The theme was one that often occupied him subsequently , upper-middle-class moral enervation ; the book caused a sensation in what was supposed to be a newly invigorated Fascist society . But it was not merely a shocker . G. A. Borgese , a much respected critic and scholar , hailed its " creative genius , " and twenty years later the French critic Jean Paulhan called it a forerunner of the existential novel , nine years before Sartre 's Nausea , thirteen years before Camus 's The Stranger . The Italian political climate in time included , of course , World War II . Moravia was always anti-Fascist , possibly as much out of disgust for Fascism 's hypocrisies and rhetorically willed activism as for its anti-individualism . In 1943 , when the Germans took command in Rome , his name was on a wanted list ; he and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a farm midway between Rome and Naples . The correlation between life and work is heightened by the fact that , from this time onward , Moravia 's class interests broadened and the point of view of his style altered . After the war , " I adopted for the first time the language of the character , the language of the first person ... not the language precisely , the tone of the language . " This new voice , " my third-first person , " was particularly useful when he ranged down the social strata to write of the making of a prostitute , in The Woman of Rome ( 1949 ) , and of the war 's damages to the rural district where he had hidden , in Two Women ( 1958 ) . The war also apparently affected his politics , which moved from the negativism of an anti-Fascist view to strong sympathies with the Left . But he has been careful to distinguish himself from rigid Marxism and the Communist Party . The first of several times that I met Moravia was in Rome during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his apartment for our appointment , the maid said he was out and asked me to wait . He came home soon after , apologized , and said he was on an emergency committee trying to help the badly housed and underfed in this harsh winter . When I asked whether it was a government committee , he snorted contemptuously and said with a wry smile , as if blizzards made strange political bedfellows , that everyone on the committee but himself was a communist ; they were the only ones who cared . Still , whatever social class he treats , however empathic his incentive , his writing can not legitimately be called engage . Many have said that his chief themes are money and sex , but that is n't really much of a distinction : the same comment could he made about Jane Austen . More particularly , the connections between sex and politics have increasingly fascinated him , but it is boredom ? in a specific Moravian perspective ? that may be the most persistent of his themes . He once said , " For me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boredom , for me , is really a sort of insufficiency or scantiness of reality . To use a metaphor , reality , when I am bored , has always had on me the disconcerting effect of too short a blanket on a winter night : put it over one 's feet and one 's chest gets cold , pull it over one 's chest and one 's feet get cold .... " Nicola Chiaromonte , reviewing Moravia 's The Empty Canvas in 1962 ( the Italian title translates as Boredom ) , said , " What Moravia actually describes again and again ... is the insufficiency of reality ( the blanket is to short ) . ... Thus it is inevitable that each time ... he should present us with the fact of consciousness , that he should make us feel the worm of consciousness at work . " This perception only underscores a large , somehow endearing , contradiction in Moravia 's career . This quality of detachment from the world , of disbelief in it , even of impatience with it , is contained within a long life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this " detached " writer , has included a lot of the most worldly kind of writing , journalism . For almost thirty years he has been the film critic of the Italian weekly L'Espresso , which is something like Time and Newsweek , only fatter . Virtually every week Italians can read Moravia on the latest films . He cherishes this work . In 1964 , while I was conducting a weekly television program about film on the PBS station in New York , I once spent a half hour speaking with him only about his work as HARPER'S/APRIL 1983 film critic . He argued that , besides his affection and enthusiasm for films themselves , the medium is so porous , so absorbent , that one ca n't experience the world completely without it : films bring the world with them . ( Ile does n't like writing for the screen , although he has done some . But a number of his novels have been filmed , among them Godard 's Contempt , made from A Ghost at Noon , Bertolucci 's The Conformist , and ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Another journalistic activity , or at least a journalistic discipline applied to fiction writing , is his contribution of short stories to the third page , the cultural page , of Italian newspapers , principally the Corriere della Sera of Milan . He has written many dozens of these Roman Tales , which have been collected in several volumes . ( The Woman of Rome began as such a story . ) Most of them are enjoyable , some of them ? " The Perfect Crime , " The Pear-wood Table , " " The Dimple , " for example ? are much better than that ; taken together , they compose a portrait of Rome , every class and district . B UT his novels are what Moravia 's reputation will stand on , or not , and at least some of them seem essential to any reader 's literary empire . Besides The Time of Indifference , important for reasons already noted , there are : Two Adolescents , two exquisite short novels about boys moving from dreams to actualities of sex ; The . Woman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flanders or the psychological surgery of Nana , is a calm , hard chronicle of determinism ; Conjugal Love , a husband 's discovery of the intricacies of marriage , which has echoes of Pirandello ; The Conformist , an excellent dramatization of the effect of Fascism on every cranny of a man 's being ; and The Empty Canvas , whose story of the relationship between a wealthy painter and his model suggests an honorable legacy from Italo Svevo 's masterpiece , As a Man Grows Older . Moravia 's two novels of the past decade have again moved upward , in class terms , and even further inward . If they are not departures in tone from his past " upper class " works , they are certainly more daring in structure . In both of them , Moravia dares to skirt the ludicrous but , because of his skill and assurance , does not tremble . Two : A Phallic Novel ( the Italian title translates as I and He ) is built on extended conversations between a man and his penis . The symbolisms , psychological and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Moravia sustains this difficult premise to achieve some effects of agony and humor and fate . Time of Desecration ( the original title , translated , is Inner Life ) consists entirely of an interview between an unidentified questioner and a wealthy teenage Roman girl . No factual ground is given to the interview : the interviewer is not an analyst or a journalist . He/she is simply the interlocutor to whom the girl responds , detailing the spectrum of pieties in bourgeois life that she loathes and 65 describing how she vindictively violates them all . Both of these books are based on dialogues , one explicitly internal , the other figuratively ; both show an aging author 's concern with the atrophy of concern . Moravia announced that Time of Desecration , published two years ago , would be his last novel ; yet here is 1934. * His new novel is at once highly complex and quite coolly na ? ve . It carries a huge freight of symbolism , but despite that freight , it proceeds with a deliberate innocence that is possible only to great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to he either a novice , faintly wide-eyed with serious ambition , or a Moravia , utterly confident that he can hold all the strings , plumb all the motifs , contrive all the incidents with something more authoritative than mere lack of embarrassment . Granted Moravia 's powers , the initial undertaking of the risk is , in itself , victory over the risk . In June 1934 , Lucio , the twenty-seven-year-old son of an evidently * Farrar , Straus and Giroux , $14.50. 66 prosperous physician , goes to Capri . Lucio has recently earned a doctorate at Munich with a dissertation on Kleist ; he will now spend some time on Capri finishing a translation of Kleist 's Michael Kohihaas and working on a novel of his own . On the boat from Naples , he travels with a German couple whom he does n't know , a middle-aged man and his young redheaded wife ; and Lucio , from whose view the story is told , is convinced , merely through furtive eye contact with her , that the young woman , Beate , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of life , both because of his innate temperament and the repellent political atmosphere of Italy ; his unfinished novel deals with his view of despair as a condition of life ; and he is imaginatively persuaded that this young woman , this stranger , shares his feelings . Subsequently , his inference seems to be substantiated ; more , she shares his thoughts about a double suicide , a la Kleist and Henriette Vogel . The story that follows on Capri is crammed with complications , even plottiness , all of which are held firm by the steadiness of Moravia 's hand . Those complications include a startling revelation about Beate 's identity . as well as her husband 's , along with the activities of an older Russian woman who is a refugee revolutionary now working for an elderly anglicized Lithuanian Jew , a rich man who has established a small museum on the island . ( The shade of Berenson hovers here . ) These people and others move through an atmosphere heavy with the politics of Italy and Germany , with anti-Semitism as a bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian revolution ( already apparent ) as a haunting specter , with the sense , in the Europe of those years , of being trapped in a steel vehicle hurtling soundlessly toward an abyss . Near the end of the book , news comes via radio of the Night of the Long Knives , June 30 , 1934 , when Hitler purged his party with mass executions . Moravia 's novel , too , ends with some German deaths . HE most striking feature of this latest novel in a long career is its difference in method and tonality ? not in theme ? from the novels that preceded it . The previous novels are , for the most part , in the twentieth-century European style that Paulhan called " existentialist . " The many stories have , for the most part , a wiriness , a sardonic quality , that put them in the line of Mau-passant . ( It 's worth noting that one story , " Bitter Honeymoon , " written in 1952 , is set on Capri and deals with a newlywed couple who have trouble consummating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very much a romantic work , in the early nineteenth-century sense . Kleist dominates Lucio as literary idol and personal example , and Moravia may have been trying to achieve a Kleistian texture in this hook about Lucio . The plentiful eroticism in the book is Moravian , not Kleistian ; but the intricacies of the plot , the inclusion of people 's narratives of experiences and dreams , the fact that the hero goes through various kinds of " poetic " travail , the patent symbolism of the story 's events , all are manifests of early nineteenth-century romance . The romantic strain is hardly unknown in Italian culture , but it is German romantic coloration that Moravia has adopted in this symbolic novel set in the era of political union between Germany and Italy . ( Albrecht Dtirer 's engraving Melencolia is a recurrent image in the book ; indeed , Beate 's eyes suggest to Lucio the young woman in the engraving . DLirer was surely no romantic , yet he is appropriate to this book . He synthesized German and Italian styles , and Melencolia itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimate frustrations of the artist . ) Besides breaking with the style of his previous work , 1934 , written near the end of Moravia 's career , is his first historical novel . ( Years earlier he wrote a historical play , Beatrice Cenci. but it is irrelevant to the mainstream of his work . ) Like Lucio , he himself was twenty-seven in 1934 . I do n't suggest that the book is , in any immediate way , autobiographical , but Moravia is unmistakably examining the era when his mature life began , the rise of the courses and forces that affected his existence , his country , his Europe . his intent is not factually analytical ; 1934 tells us nothing new about its subjects in sociopolitical terms . His intent is in his method : he chose romance , a particular species of romance , as an instrument of irony . What 1934 presents , initially and finally , is itself , its being as a work of romantic art . That this superbly equipped writer should have chosen this mode of all modes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most resonant comment he could make on the horrors contained and implied in the material . Moravia 's career began with daring . Near the end of that career , he dares again , differently . 1934 is not an overwhelming experience ; Moravia requires our collaboration , our confidence in his confidence , to complete this odd , oddly affecting work . What 's especially admirable is that , though he courageously tried new means , he has maintained himself . He is still the explorer of " true hell , " which is how Nicola Chiaromonte described Moravia 's fundamental subject . " True hell is ... in all that hides us from ourselves , hiding from us the fact that we are living in a morally dead world . " Whether it is dead or " only " dangerously moribund , here is the old anatomist , Moravia , using the techniques of nineteenth-century Sturm and Drang to expose twentieth-century disease . Fifty-four years since his first novel , so great a span that whole careers have risen and fallen within it , Moravia , sometimes reaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirers , now long past the parish of chic or an interest in it , works on , ventures on . Only moral energy can save us ; and , apparently , the artists who most clearly perceive the approach of the Ice Age are the ones who , paradoxically , work hardest , are the best sources of the energy we need .
