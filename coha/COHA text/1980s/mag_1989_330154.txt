DRIVING MISS DAISY <P> Directed by Bruce Beresford <P> Screenplay by Alfred Uhry <P> It is the season when movies are ablaze with self-importance , urging us to contemplate , through various fictive metaphors , the great issues of our time . And , by the way , to spare some kindly thoughts for the high-mindedness of their makers and their worthiness for Oscar nominations . <P> Such a metaphor is available in Driving Miss Daisy . If you look hard , you can find in this account of the 25-year relationship between Daisy Werthan ( Jessica Tandy ) , a genteel Southern , Jewish matriarch , and her black chauffeur , Hoke Colburn ( Morgan Freeman ) , a microcosmic study of changing racial attitudes in a crucial time and place ( Atlanta , circa 1948-73 ) . What you will not find in this marvelously understated movie is overtly inspirational comments on that subject , broad sentimentality or the slightest pomposity about its own mission . In other words , Alfred Uhry 's adaptation of his Pulitzer-prizewinning play aspires more to complex observation of human behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its priorities straight , it succeeds superbly on both levels . <P> Director Bruce Beresford 's tone is cool and shadowy  --  like Miss Daisy 's fine old house . Hoke is introduced into it by her son Boolie ( Dan Aykroyd , displaying full credentials as an actor ) , when at 72 Miss Daisy careers her car into a neighbor 's yard . She has objections , suspicions . She harbors  --  yes  --  more racial prejudice than she has ever been forced to admit . <P> But Hoke is a wise and patient man . And Miss Daisy is a woman worthy of those qualities . She may be comically set in her small ways , but she casts a shrewd eye on her immediate world . As she ages , that world shrinks , so that Hoke looms ever larger within it . As a result , she is forced to think harder about the growing civil rights struggle than she might otherwise have . An encounter with menacing red-neck cops on a country road , the bombing of her synagogue , a distant but moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s oratory all have their effect on her . But mostly it is the simple presence of a good man that grants her age 's greatest benison , expanding rather than shrinking her humanity . <P> One can not speak too highly of the subtlety that two great actors , Freeman and Tandy , bring to their roles . Or of the faith that Beresford places in their ability to convey large emotions through an exchange of glances in a rearview mirror . Or of his trust in a script that speaks most eloquently through silences and indirection . All , finally , have placed their faith in the audience 's ability to read their delicately stated work with the responsiveness it deserves . It would be a shame to fail them . <P> GLORY <P> Directed by Edward Zwick <P> Screenplay by Kevin Jarre <P> It just slips under the wire as the first large-scale Civil War film of the decade . And it may be the last of the millennium , so far out of favor ( and economic viability ) have historical epics of all kinds fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheer novelty of the thing and from admiration for the producers ' gumption in flinging it in the face of the movie audience 's indifference to the pretelevised past .
