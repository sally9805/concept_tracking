" Like Webster 's Dictionary , we 're Morocco bound . " That lyric , warbled by Hope and Crosby as they jounced along one of their more amiable roads back in 1942 , is outrageous enough to have been penned by Rogers and Clarke , the comically dreadful songwriting team played by Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman in Ishtar . The two pictures share similarities besides their North African setting : agreeably low-keyed playing by their stars , a plot that involves them dangerously in local politics , and about the same quota of gags . There is one important difference : Ishtar cost roughly 40 times as much as Road to Morocco . Laughter can choke on such wretched excess . <P> The auteur of Ishtar the movie is film 's shyest comic talent , Elaine May . The auteur of Ishtar the event ( or would-be event ) is the medium 's shyest  --  but also slyest  --  actor-producer , Warren Beatty . It is important to keep those functions separate in mind . Otherwise it is hard to enjoy either the film or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) production is bound to engender . <P> May is a woman who makes wallflower movies like The Heartbreak Kid and A New Leaf , whose fine individual qualities are overlooked by the great , noisy media bash of the age . Beatty is , of course , Beatty : a man in whose career- drama the actual movies he stars in are merely incidents . In a daringly speculative new book , Warren Beatty and Desert Eyes ( Doubleday ; $17.95 ) , Critic David Thomson puts it this way : Beatty 's ambition now is " to see if he can be only a star  --  not a star kept alight by regular work and appearance , but a star who exists according to the self-perpetuating mechanics of stardom . " In this grand scheme , his notoriety as a womanizer is of small consequence  --  a titillating false trail to keep the gossip press yapping . So is acting , at least in the conventional sense of the word . Performing is something that Beatty , whom Thomson calls a man " doubting and growing querulous . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must infrequently and reluctantly do in order to secure a larger , much more complex and devious aim . <P> This goal is to see if he can turn movie production into a form of seduction , in which large , supposedly rational corporations are encouraged to spend bloated sums of money for unlikely enterprises . Five years ago , Paramount and Barclays Bank parted with not less than $40 million to make Reds , an epic-scale love story of two American radicals of small historical importance and no contemporary resonance . Now he has persuaded Columbia Pictures to throw a similar sum at this modest little comedy . <P> To be sure , May has sent her plot sense out for assertiveness training . One recognizes her terrible songsters as authentic May characters ; she has always had compassion for articulate , depressed dreamers grounded in reality only by two left feet . With visions of Simon and Garfunkel galumphing through their minds , the Rogers and Clarke duo have been sent by their agent to try out their new lounge act  --  as far out of town as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adjani , whom they both mistake for a boy at first ; a CIA operative ( Charles Grodin ) who is not nearly so smooth a counterrevolutionary as he thinks he is ; and a blind camel that provides the film with its best running  --  actually stumbling  --  gag .
