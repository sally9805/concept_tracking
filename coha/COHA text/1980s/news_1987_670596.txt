There is no consensus , however , about alternatives because public assistance grants - the housing allowance plus a basic living grant - represent just one piece in the jigsaw puzzle of efforts to solve the severe shortage of low-income housing in New York City. // For many of those on public assistance , the increase is welcome but falls short . " It ' s still going be a real squeeze , " said Bridget Sulker , whose shelter allowance is now $40 less than the $284. 61 monthly rent on her one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn . After paying the telephone and utility bills , Ms. Sulker , who has two teen-age daughters , will have $155 in food stamps and about $125 left from her grant for living expenses. // The size of the housing allowance has contributed to the growing number of homeless families in New York City , most experts say . More than 25 , 000 people , most of them with low incomes , are evicted for nonpayment of rent in the city each year. // Last month , the utilities were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a city marshal was ordered to evict her , and Legal Aid lawyers rejected her case as hopeless . " I was almost out of my wits , " said Ms. Sulker . The Welfare Rights Network , an independent Brooklyn agency financed by the city , straightened out her case in two days . Ultimately , the city agreed to advance money for back rent but refused to pay the overdue rent up to the amount of her shelter allowance . Her landlord finally agreed to accept $100 less than full payment. // " Bridget Sulker is a nice person , " the landlord , B. Wanda Gayle , said . " But what good is that when you ' ve got empty pockets ? " <> <> ' Really No Life at All ' // Next month , the increased shelter allowance will cover Ms. Sulker ' s rent , but her $154 food stamp allotment will be cut to $147 because the Federal Government reduces food stamp grants by about $1 for every $3 increase in public assistance . In addition , her basic living grant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city for making back-rent payments. // " It ' s really no life at all , " said Ms. Sulker. // Maria Escribano , a mother of three young children and a former heroin addict , also struggles to get by on public assistance . " The everyday living thing , it gets you suffocated , " she said . The monthly rent on her six-room apartment in the Bronx is $432. 31 , or $188 more than her current shelter allowance and $147 higher than the allowance will be after Jan. 1. // The State Social Services Department now has a housing-allowance budget of $1. 2 billion , which will rise by $153. 8 million Friday ; the fund from which basic living grants are paid out will remain at $1 billion. // In New York City , where 75 percent of the state ' s 1. 3 million welfare recipients reside , the total expenditure for public assistance will be almost $2 billion next year , including a $39 million increase in the housing grants , which will then total $949 million. // By comparison , fast-growing programs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . Four years ago , the cost for the city ' s Human Resources Administration , which is primarily responsible for homeless programs , was $66 million . <> <> Dramatic Comparison // The comparison of costs is most dramatic at the level of individual families : average living and shelter grants for a welfare family of three now total $5 , 964 a year . Housing and social services for a homeless family of three living in a hotel cost $23 , 270 a year , or $37 , 595 a year in emergency shelters , according to city figures. // The Federal Government pays 50 percent of the cost of public assistance and homeless programs , and the state and local governments each pay 25 percent. // " Investments in alleviating poverty are much more sensible and probably less costly than dealing with the consequences of poverty itself , " said Victor E. Bach , referring to social problems that include homelessness , crime and unemployment .

" It ' s better than no increase at all , but it can not be looked on as a panacea to help the majority of people on welfare - or as a solution to the long-term problems of inadequate low-income housing or getting people off welfare , " said William J. Grinker , the city ' s Human Resources Administrator . <> <> A Formula to Set Limits // The shelter allowance has had almost nothing to do with marketplace rents since 1974 , when the state stopped paying the actual rents and adopted a formula for setting maximum limits on rent payments for families of varying sizes in each of 58 districts around the state. // In 1984 , the allowance was increased for the first time , by an average of 25 percent ; during the same 10-year period , New York City rents increased by 91 percent , according to the city. // The monthly allowance now ranges from $193 for a single person to $383 for a family of eight ; the majority of welfare families have three people - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $244 . Next month , these monthly allowances will have increases ranging from $22 to $46 , with the biggest increase going to three-member families. // When the shelter allowance is inadequate , families must dip into their basic grant , which is roughly the same amount as their shelter grant. // Some housing experts argue that a more realistic shelter allowance would be about $100 a room , or about $400 a month for a two-bedroom apartment . The allowance should be indexed to reflect increases mandated for the city ' s 1. 2 million rent-regulated apartments , said Clara Fox , director emeritus of the Settlement Housing Fund , a nonprofit housing development organization in New York City . " For taxpayers , the added costs of a realistic allowance would reduce homelessness and expenditures for shelters , " she said . <> <> Tough Competition // Welfare budgets , however , have tough competition in Albany . " It ' s a budgetary item and the increase has to be weighed against requests for other social service needs , " said Michael J. Dowling , deputy commissioner for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sternlieb , former director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University , contends that a substantial rise in the shelter allowance would cause as many problems as it solved - unless it were accompanied by substantial production of housing for low-income families . " If you doubled the housing allowance , to reach market levels , it would cause great inflation and it would displace low-income people who are not on welfare , " he said . " The only way out of this is for the city to build more housing. " // City statistics show that the housing allowance currently covers the rent for only 40 percent of the city ' s 362 , 000 public assistance households - and about half of these households with low rents live in some form of public housing. // The remaining 60 percent of the city ' s welfare households , or about 187 , 000 families , have rents that exceed their shelter allowance by an average of almost $75 . As a result of the increase in shelter allowances , the number of families with rents exceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average excess rent will fall to an average of $67 a month. // City and state officials said it was nearly impossible for welfare recipients to survive without earning or borrowing some money every month , but only 2 percent of the city ' s welfare recipients report outside income - presumably because such income reduces grant allowances. //
