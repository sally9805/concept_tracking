To a prosecutor , it is a daily parade of accused criminals whose sheer numbers almost guarantee that they will be freed or sentenced on reduced charges. // Like many of those who work in Criminal Court , Judge Irving Lang , Michael J. Meagher , an assistant district attorney , and Robynn Abrams , a defense lawyer with the Legal Aid Society , have special perspectives on the court ' s problems . In the course of a single day , they confront many of those problems - sometimes coping , sometimes despairing . Page B2. // Wednesday , June 15 , was a working day like many others for Judge Irving Lang , Michael J. Meagher , an assistant district attorney , and Robynn Abrams of the Legal Aid Society . The problems of New York City ' s Criminal Court - the avalanche of cases , the chaotic race to dispose of them , the sense of justice undermined by logistics - have been examined here through their eyes . <> <> By E.R. SHIPP // They were all part of a fast parade in Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Rumanian or Chinese . Defendants who didn ' t know who or where their attorneys were . Lawyers with more cases than they could handle , seeking long adjournments. // " A couple of weeks ? " asked one . " Think in terms of days , not weeks , counselor , " Judge Lang advised . Judge Lang takes pride in his ability to race through a calendar of 100 cases or more - disposing of a good percentage through dismissals or plea bargains - and be finished before 5 o ' clock , the official close of the court day. // That satisfaction was not to be allowed him on June 15 , much to the chagrin of his court officers in All-Purpose Part 5 in Manhattan . All day the officers had reminded him that they wanted to get away early for a 6 o ' clock softball game in Queens . <> <> A Few Minutes to Each // But 118 cases stood between them and the ball game : cases in which records would be incomplete , lawyers or clients or witnesses would be missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiated , motions would be made , objections would be raised and Judge Lang would have just a few minutes to devote to each. // He would finish at exactly 5 o ' clock . At 10 : 05 , he took the bench - robeless , as is his style - a full half-hour after defendants , their families and their attorneys had begun filing in. // The defendants stood behind a table placed several feet from the judge . They waited - nervously if this was their first arrest , at ease if they were old hands - as their attorneys tried to strike deals with judge and prosecutor during off-the-record chats at the bench. // The tone of these conversations depended on whether the young lawyers - prosecutors from District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau ' s office and , in most cases , defense lawyers from the Legal Aid Society - were prepared to bargain from what Judge Lang thought were reasonable positions. // Frequently , he chided a lawyer for trying to hold out for too much . At times , he advised against a guilty plea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a client or criticized the assistant district attorney for a lack of information about a case . <> <> From Prosecutor to Judge // For Judge Lang , who is 54 years old and has served on the bench since 1969 , his own experience is the key to his approach . For 10 years , he was an assistant district attorney under Frank S. Hogan in Manhattan , eventually rising to chief of the Narcotics Bureau . After that , he served three years as a member and counsel to the state ' s Narcotics Addiction Control Commission. // Judge Lang earns $57 , 299 a year . Court officers , who oversee the security , the paper work and the ceaseless parade of people who come before the judge , earn in the neighborhood of $30 , 000. // By contrast , the defendants , for the most part , live on the fringes of society . The judge and prosecutors look at the compendium of their past arrests and convictions - known as rap sheets - see that they live in certain neighborhoods , check out their manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly size them up as career thief , career prostitute , career burglar , career criminal . This gulf between their world and that of Judge Lang and his crew of officers must be bridged in the three or four minutes they will have before him. // " You can tell a lot from a cold piece of paper , " the judge said , flipping through the record of past arrests and convictions of a defendant whose name had just been called. // " Burglar ' s tools , burglar ' s tools , grand larceny " - he ticked off the cases as he went through the several sheets that made up the man ' s criminal history. // " He ' s a car thief , " he explained . <> <> Avoiding the ' Traffic Jam ' // But even with the emphasis on speed , Judge Lang said , justice is not sacrificed . " The fact that we do things in a short period of time does not mean that you have not assessed a number of factors , " he said . " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the complaint , the criminal record , the R.O.R. sheet . So , by the time the defendant ' s actually in front of the bench , I know what the charges are and the weaknesses or gaps in the facts . When you have a high volume , if you don ' t act with a certain degree of quickness , you get backed up in a traffic jam. // " There ' s no reason that an incident that took five minutes should take five days to recount . " Several times he dismissed cases because of dissatisfaction with the prosecutor . Once he told Jonathan D. Siegel , the assistant district attorney on duty in AP-5 , " I ' m not here to act as a clerk for the D.A. ' s office by adjourning cases that don ' t move with celerity . " <> <> ' Watch What You Sell ' // At 10 : 29 and on his seventh case , Judge Lang took the first of 15 guilty pleas and passed sentence . A woman , a clerk in a novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for selling lethal weapons . She pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of disorderly conduct , and because this was her first arrest , Judge Lang questioned her about whether her decision to forgo a trial was voluntary . He barked out questions in rapid-fire succession as she nodded nonstop. // Finally he said : " $50 or 5 days . Watch what you sell . " By lunch break at 1 : 10 , Judge Lang had handled 59 cases . He returned to court at 2 : 45 . After lunch , he had gone upstairs to State Supreme Court to sentence a man . For 10 years , until last year , Judge Lang had worked as an acting justice in that court , and this was a leftover matter. // The afternoon brought its own frustrations , often involving defendants for whom warrants had been issued when they failed to appear . When they strolled in after lunch , warrants had to be vacated and court papers retrieved . <> <> Warnings From the Judge // " There ' s a general perception that you can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you show up voluntarily , the judge is not going to do anything , " he said. // To each of a half-dozen people he saw in succession , Judge Lang issued the same warning : If they were not present at 9 : 30 on their next court date , he would throw them in jail. // One defendant had two misdemeanor cases before Judge Lang for possession of burglar ' s tools and attempted petty larceny , but because he also faced a felony charge in State Supreme Court , the misdemeanor cases were going nowhere. // The defense , he explained , will not budge until the felonies have been resolved . " They don ' t want to plead because they don ' t want the possible conviction to be used on cross-examination in the case upstairs , " he said. // " If we could send all his cases upstairs , then the package deal could be worked out up there . There are a hundred cases like this . " Judges refer to the practice of allowing a defendant with several pending cases to plead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once again , he adjourned the misdemeanor cases . <> <> ' We ' ve Got to Move ' // At 3 : 30 , a court officer told Judge Lang : " We ' ve got to really move . Go into high gear . " " Yeah , we ' ve got to move , " Judge Lang agreed . A case that had been pending for six months was adjourned , this time because no lawyer had come . " We haven ' t got the facilities to handle every loitering and hypodermic needle charge like that , " the judge said . " We just eventually give them a conditional discharge or something. " // A conditional discharge - which sets a defendant free with at most a lecture after he has pleaded guilty , usually to a reduced charge - means nothing to most defendants , Judge Lang said . But if the defendant is a repeat offender , he added , at some point the conditional discharges will come back to haunt him. // " Finally , one day someone will look at the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At that point , he will get a jail sentence . " <> <> By M.A. FARBER // The defendant was dead , and to Michael J. Meagher , a 26-year old assistant district attorney in Manhattan , this unexpected turn was less a cause for sentiment than for reassessing his caseload . It was the kind of thing that happened in his job , a job that lurched easily from boredom to bafflement. // Mr. Meagher learned of the death about 9 A.M. on June 15 , a day when , as a junior prosecutor in an office of 320 lawyers , he was responsible for handling or helping to handle more than 100 misdemeanor cases in A.P. 1 , one of the six " all purpose " parts of Criminal Court in Manhattan. // As usual , he had bicycled to work at 1 Hogan Place , in lower Manhattan , from his apartment near Gramercy Park . Resting the bike against the criminal-procedure and penal-code books that line the shelves of the air-conditioned nook he shares with two other young assistants , Mr. Meagher opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of telephones , began poring over a twofoot-high stack of case files. // In one file , relating to an assault charge , he found a message saying the defendant had suddenly died . " Well , that really helps me , " Mr. Meagher mused aloud , a smile creasing his clean-shaven , boyish face . But as with many matters in the congested Criminal Court - as , indeed , with much in the professional lives of the men and women who represent " The People " there - things were somewhat more complex . The dead man was scheduled to be a key witness for the prosecution in another case . <> <> A Variety of Cases // Mr. Meagher hung the coat of his gray suit on the back of a chair , straightened his red paisley tie and hurried through the other files . There were cases of disorderly conduct , trespassing , petty larceny and drug possession , all marked for the day ' s calendar. // In nearly a year as a prosecutor - he was recruited by the District Attorney ' s office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School - Mr. Meagher has had as many as 150 active cases of his own at one time . But in a criminal-justice system in which the vast majority of cases end in guilty pleas or dismissals , he has tried fewer than 10 cases and only three before a jury. // Mr. Meagher ' s appearances in A.P. 1 reflect only one of his duties as a $21 , 000-a-year assistant in Criminal Court . At other times , he works in an arraignment part or in the complaint room ; interviews police officers and witnesses and draws up charges ; monitors lineups ; orders laboratory reports on illegal substances ; writes parole letters ; works on his own cases , and , occasionally , drafts an appeal brief. // This day , June 15 , was barely under way for him . With court scheduled to open at 9 : 30 A.M. - A.P. 1 is on the fourth floor of Criminal Court at 100 Centre Street , the same bullding that houses the District Attorney ' s office - Mr. Meagher badgered his colleagues for missing case notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the elevator . <> <> Filling the Courtroom // " What have you got going ? " he called to another assistant in the hallway . " D-rated robbery . " " Sounds good . " A.P. 1 was filling up , but slowly . About 40 people , most of them defendants or court-appointed attorneys who handle the cases of indigent people not represented by the Legal Aid Society , lounged on wooden seats stained by decades of wear and sweat . A police officer in uniform occupied the same row as a gaudily dressed transvestite , whose assault case , like many other cases , would be adjourned that day. // Judge Leslie Snyder , who was appointed to the Criminal Court three months ago , presided - and mediated . Mr. Meagher , Russell Neufeld , a Legal Aid lawyer , and other lawyers plodded through the calendar for several hours , but much of what they had to say about this case or that was said off the record at bench conferences with the judge . <> <> P.R.W.O. Spells Trial // Some cases were dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trial dates were set but will almost certainly be delayed for lack of trial parts . Many pleas seemed dependent on a promise from Judge Snyder that the defendant would not be jailed . Mr. Meagher , juggling one blue-jacketed misdemeanor file after another , was ordered to provide a number of defendants with " open file discovery , " or access to the prosecution ' s records on the case . In many instances , the defendant did not appear , and Judge Snyder ordered the familiar P.R.W.O. , parole revoked , warrant ordered. // " The joke in Criminal Court , " Mr. Meagher remarked later , " is that trial is spelled P.R.W.O. " A grocery-store worker who had had a gun under disputed circumstances pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a weapon . He stood before Judge Snyder with his hands behind his back , saying little . Sentencing was put off until August. // A man who had hit a police car while " coming from the wake of a very close friend " received a $250 fine and revocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted for shoplifting and had apparently used dozens of aliases had her case postponed . According to her attorney , she was now in the Nassau County Jail on other charges . A man who , according to his attorney , received cocaine as a " wedding present " pleaded guilty to drug possession , but only after denying that he had had the drug . <> <> Low Point of the Morning // Perhaps the low point of Mr. Meagher ' s morning came at 10 : 45 , when Judge Snyder dismissed a drug case " for failure to prosecute . " A laboratory report on the substance at issue , suspected to be cocaine , had been lost in the maze of paper work that accompanies any case through the system , and the judge said she would wait no longer for it. // At lunch , bought at a snack bar , Mr. Meagher washed down a yogurt with iced tea . He graduated from Marquette University in Milwaukee with a view to teaching American history in college . He earned a master ' s degree in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete problems that needed to be addressed. " // After deciding at Cornell that corporate law practice was not for him - " that ' s all about money , there ' s no mystery in it " - he won one of the 50 spots for which several thousand law graduates annually apply to the Manhattan District Attorney ' s office . " This is just the most dynamic place you could be , " he said . " In A.P. 1 , you never know what ' s going to happen. " // " The most disappointing thing I ' ve seen on the job is the way victims are treated by the system , " he said . " If you ' ve ever seen an innocent victim intimidated by a defendant or reduced to tears on a stand , well , it drives me insane . It ' s not hard to understand why a lot of people don ' t want to cooperate. " // Mr. Meagher said he was also surprised by " how little result we get from prosecuting chronic offenders . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can affect some situations , but it ' s mostly at the margins . " At 2 P.M. , Mr. Meagher was again wrapped in the mystery of A.P. 1 . In one case he brushed off a suggestion by Mr. Neufeld of Legal Aid that a recent crackdown on drunken drivers was the result of " political pressure " and needed to be tested constitutionally at trial . Why , Mr. Meagher asked , couldn ' t the defendant " count down from 10 " when he was arrested ? And " what about the two rum-and-Coke glasses on the front seat ? " // Then he and Mr. Neufeld tangled over a case of a man charged with patronizing a prostitute . " Is that being prosecuted these days ? " Mr. Neufeld asked incredulously . Mr. Meagher managed a smile . " It certainly is , unless there ' s a plea to the charge . " Judge Snyder looked at the combatants and adjourned the matter . " Anyway , " she sighed , " every case here gets decided on its own merits . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her time waiting . Nine months after joining the Legal Aid Society and beginning her work in Criminal Court in Manhattan , Miss Abrams , who is 30 years old , has seen only two of her cases get as far as a hearing , and neither has gone to trial . The rest have been dismissed or plea@bargained or , most often , simply adjourned. // " It ' s frustrating , because sometimes you don ' t feel like a lawyer , but like a traffic cop , " she said . " It ' s embarrassing to be part of a system where you have to tell your client for the umpteenth time , ' Your case isn ' t going today. ' " // For Miss Abrams , born in the Bronx , raised in Plainview , L.I. , working for Legal Aid is the fulfillment of a dream , nurtured during her college days at the State University ' s college in Plattsburgh , when she taught English to inmates at the Clinton Correctional Facility , then at the John Jay Colege of Criminal Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stints in the City Police Department and the Brooklyn District Attorney ' s office. // On June 15 , she arrived at the Legal Aid offices at 80 Lafayette Street at 9 : 30 A.M. From the outset , she waited ; only one elevator was working , and a line had formed . Her desk was strewn with what she called " other peoples ' lives " - manila file folders , one for each case she was to handle that day . <> <> A History of Adjournments // In one , a 21-year-old man was charged with assaulting a woman last August after a performance of " Harlem Renaissance " a musical revue at a midtown theater . The case had been adjourned 11 times before. // In the world of Criminal Court , where most courtroom appearances seem like station breaks , trials are epic events calling for special preparation . Miss Abrams had reviewed the case for three hours the night before and had prepared questions for jury selection. // There were other items on the agenda . A 19-year-old was charged with possessing stolen property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate . The prosecution has offered him a " violation " - harsher than a parking ticket , softer than a misdemeanor - an offer Miss Abrams declined to accept . It was the youth ' s first arrest , she explained , and " The People " had not proved that he had known the plate was stolen . <> <> ' The Ultimate Justice ' // Another man , charged with stealing eight pairs of socks from Macy ' s and now being held on Rikers Island in $1 , 000 bail , was to return to court ; last time the case was adjourned because the clerk ' s office could not find his court papers. // At around 10 o ' clock , Miss Abrams took the five-minute walk over to Criminal Court and glided past the aphorisms carved into the stone of the entryway . " Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people ? " one of them reads // Her goals are less lofty . " I don ' t think people come here anymore thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " she said . " It ' s more like fighting the system , making sure the people I come into contact with don ' t get stepped on. " // In the world of Criminal Court , lawyering is a matter of circulating and bargaining and striking quick deals - and that is a task for which Miss Abrams , lithe and chatty , seemed well equipped . <> <> The Frenetic Routine // Outside All-Purpose Part 9 , the frenetic routine began . Within the first hour and a half , Miss Abrams , seeming more like a floor trader on the New York Stock Exchange than an advocate , greeted one defendant ; checked the holding pen to see if another had arrived from Rikers Island ; asked if any trial parts were available ; greeted Judge Jay Gold with a " hiya , judge , " and met with John McCusker and Michelle Lehr , the prosecutors handling two of her cases. // Even before the day began , Miss Abrams ' s schedule had been thrown into disarray . Miss Lehr had called the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Manhattan man charged with assaulting his former lover and threatening her over the phone , so it had to be adjourned , for the eighth time. // Then Mr. McCusker , who the day before had said he was ready to try the theater assault , told Miss Abrams that the police officer expected to testify was not available . Another adjournment. // It was time for the daily ritual of rescheduling , acted out on this day in huddles at the edge of the Complaint Room . One case was set for July 7 , but the other proved more difficult . Mr. McCusker will be away the first two weeks of July , a co-defendant will be in Puerto Rico after that , and his attorney , Joel E. Abramson , will be away all of August . They agreed on September. // Although it is Legal Aid that is generally accused of obstruction , Miss Abrams said later , in many instances it is the prosecution that seeks postponement. // One of Miss Abrams ' s clients - they can not be named because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest adjournment . He compared the process to a crapshoot. // " She works very hard - she just hasn ' t hit six yet , " he said of Miss Abrams . " I even feel a little bit of pity for her . " At 12 : 07 , a breakthrough : Mr. McCusker offered Miss Abrams an " A.C.D. " in the moped case . The case will be adjourned and , six months hence , dismissed if the defendant does not get into any other trouble. // " You have to sweat blood to get one of those , " she said . <> <> Waiting , Watching , Whispering // Agreeing to a plea bargain is one thing ; hammering it through it is another . For 45 minutes , Miss Abrams waited , watched and whispered with Casey Donovan , another Legal Aid lawyer , as a Russian immigrant charged with drunken driving testified in his own defense . Lunchtime was from 1 to 2 , and when court reopened at 2 : 25 , the moped case was finally called . Twenty-six seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one heard little and understood less of what was going on in the huddle at the bench . Miss Abrams came back to explain . " All you have to do is keep cool for six months , " she told him . " This is better than a trial . This way they can ' t go after your friend. " // He smiled wanly , walked out of Criminal Court and out of Robynn Abrams ' s life . He didn ' t thank her . " I don ' t expect gratitude from my clients , " she said . " It sounds corny , but it ' s almost my pleasure to represent them . Also , many of them feel wronged by the being in court . So why should they feel grateful to me ? " <> <> Time for Catching Up // Half an hour later , Miss Abrams went back to Legal Aid to catch up on phone calls , paper work and the office gossip about her colleagues : Pac Man is marrying the Aspirin Queen , she was told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evenings , at her Greenwich Village apartment , Miss Abrams will do " mindless " things - lift weights , watch " Dynasty " on TV , play with her cats - all in a largely futile attempt to keep her mind off work. // " I have dreams about my clients , " she said . " The other night , I dreamt one of them was horribly killed at Rikers . Or I ' ll think ' Oh , God , should I have pled that person ? Will I get that offer again ? " // There are , indeed , times when she wonders why she subjects herself to it all . <> <> ' Find It Very Depressing ' // " I walk into the courtroom , and I find it very depressing looking around me , " she said . " Everyone sitting there is treated very badly , and nobody ' s ever really being helped . I want to go , ' Robynn , you have only one life to live . Why are you subjecting yourself to all this all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // But Miss Abrams said the frustrations magnify the accomplishments , the lives that are turned around . " Sometimes I think I ' ve helped someone start a new life , " she said . " I ' ll stay as long as I feel I ' m rendering proper service to my clients . If there comes a day when I feel I ' ve had it them them or that I ' m not being caring enough , I ' ll leave. " //
