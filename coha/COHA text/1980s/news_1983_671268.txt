This is likely to change in the near future , and audio dealers anticipate a brisk trade in second-hand components with adequate protection for buyers . The impetus for all this comes from the new laser disks , whose sonic challenges prompt the more committed audio fans to upgrade their amplifiers and speakers . Rather than simply bestow the old equipment on poor relations , growing children or other worthy beneficiaries , upwardly-mobile audio fans increasingly rely on shops to give them a trade-in allowance for their used components . Such trade-ins are then reconditioned and resold , usually at about half their original price . Since the anticipated influx of trade-ins comes from serious listeners eager to keep abreast of the latest advances , such equipment is apt to be well-chosen in the first place and well cared for during its period of prior use. // // The second-hand market may therefore give budget- bound buyers a chance for a better system than they could otherwise afford . But unless the store where such equipment is bought is experienced in testing and reconditioning used components and guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance . After all , few buyers have the necessary test instruments and expertise to verify that the used merchandise is in good condition . There are , however , a few long- established specialists in the resale field , such as the Audio Exchange in New York City , which have evolved policies and procedures to minimize the buyer ' s risk. // " There ' s no way the customer can get stung , " insists Bill Colbert , the founder of the Exchange . Himself an ardent hobbyist , Mr. Colbert needed to turn his sound gear into cash to finance the upgrading of his system . Assuming other audio fans to have similar needs , he established the Exchange back in the 50 ' s and now operates branches in Greenwich Village and the Wall Street area . One of Mr. Colbert ' s principles is to let the buyer bring back any purchase within five days and get a full refund . " Nobody has to give reasons for returning the merchandise , and our salesmen are instructed to ask no questions , " Mr. Colbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an unconditional 90-day guarantee . Three months , Mr. Colbert believes , is long enough to show up any hidden defect . " If the equipment works well during that period , it is likely to keep working for much longer. " // Many other audio dealers are now expanding their test facilities and service departments to recondition trade-ins , and some offer terms and guarantees of such items similar to those of the Audio Exchange . In addition , prospective buyers can increase their chance of satisfaction by buying only those components second- hand which are inherently more reliable . For example , used loudspekers clearly rate as prime prospects because speakers do not wear out with prolonged use . A used model can be expected to sound literally like new . Of course , a speaker may have been damaged by overloads , but this is readily detected by a simple listening test . A rasping sound - caused by a rubbing coil - easily identifies a maltreated speaker when played at high volume . An ample supply of good second-hand bookshelf speakers is expected this fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers for bigger models that can properly reproduce the added bass contained on laser disks. // Along with their old loudspeakers , those bound for the digital Elysium may trade in amplifiers and receivers too weak to render the exuberant dynamics of the new disks but perfectly adequate for playing conventional records . Here , then , lies an another opportunity for bargain hunters. // // Since solid-state amplifiers and receivers are largely impervious to the effects of age under normal use , they offer excellent second-hand values . But again , they should be checked for possible signs of abuse , especially damage from overheating . Sometimes such injury is evident in the form of audible distortion at higher volume levels or crackling noises ( caused by the incipient failure of capacitors ) when the unit is first turned on . In any event , second-hand receivers and amplifiers should be checked out on the test bench to confirm that they still meet their original specifications in terms of frequency response , power output and distortion . In addition , all controls should be individually tested for proper function , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway point , the hum level should remain unobtrusive , especially when the input selector is in the " phono " position . As for the FM tuner , the indication of the tuning meter should coincide with the clearest sound for any given station . Otherwise , the tuner is in need of alignment. // Certain components do not age well and therefore are poor candidates for second-hand purchase . These include turntables , tape reorders and phono cartridges . Being mainly mechanical devices , they tend to wear and may be ripe for retirement by the time they reach the resale shelf . It is , of course , possible to attempt their rejuvenation by replacing obviously worn parts , but repairing the subtler manifestations of mechanical wear is beyond the ken of most service technicians . Steer clear of any turntable or tape deck that makes odd noises when running while the volume control is turned all the way down ; and as for phono cartridges , the kindest thing you can do for your records is to get a new one. // //     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
