W atch him walk through an airport . Heads turn , there are startled , questioning looks , and then  --  as they see it really is the person they think it is  --  broad smiles , outstretched hands , and cries of welcome . " Hey , Lawrence , how are you ! It 's wonderful to see you ! " Its as if they 're greeting an old and very dear friend , and , in a way , they are . Lawrence Welk is friends with the whole country . The affectionate rapport between Welk and his fans is amazing . Just recently he flew home from Florida where he had been competing in the Disney World Golf Tournament . He was tired , pleasantly so , and looking forward to a nice , relaxing flight . But no sooner were they safely airborne than the stewardess appeared with some slips of paper in her hand . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Welk , " she said , " but so many passengers spotted you getting on board  --  I wonder , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Lawrence , getting up immediately , " sure . I 'll just go back and say hello , too . " And he does . Up one aisle and down the other he goes , signing autographs , shaking hands , laughing , joking , hugging a few babies , kissing a grandma or two , and listening attentively as passenger after passenger grabs his hand and pulls him close to say they never miss his show . " Why , thank you , " he says  --  and means it ? " thank you very much ! " It takes him perhaps half an hour to make the rounds , and when he reaches the door leading to his own section , he turns for a quick wave good-bye . To his astonishment , the whole group rises as one and tenders him a round of applause and cheers . " It 's the first time , " he said later , still looking a little dazzled , " that I ever got a standing ovation in the sky ! " One of the chief charms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 years of entertaining the American public , they still want to see him , touch him , get his autograph  --  and sometimes talk his arm off ! " Does n't it ever bug you ? " I asked him . He grinned . " No , never . It would only bug me if they did n't ! " There does n't seem to be much chance of that happening . On the contrary , people seem eager to express their appreciation , affection  --  even love  --  for this 76-yearold man who was able to transcendsome of the most severe limitations ever laid on one human being and overcome them to achieve a super-stardom which now seems as firmly fixed as the evening star . Maybe it 's because he 's one of us  --  the farm boy who made good , the uneducated youngster who had enough moxie and drive to make it off the farm and into the rarefied atmosphere of stardom . Or maybe it 's because he seems to personify all that is best in the American character , a man who made good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire . Whatever it is , Lawrence Welk seems to have forged an enduring bond with the American people , and this year he and his Musical Family are celebrating their silver anniversary on television , something never achieved by any musical show in history . That 's 25 years of consecutive weekly broadcasts , one a week for 52 weeks a year . In a business where the life span of most shows is one to ten years  --  if they 're lucky , that is  --  the Welk record is almost unbelievable . He did n't start out with that particular goal in mind . " I just wanted to earn my living in music , " he told me . " But I guess one thing kind of led to another . " Indeed it did ! From farm boy to small-time bandleader . . . to big-time bandleader . . . to radio . . . to television . . . to business tycoon  --  he 's our own Horatio Alger come to life ! In fact , if a scriptwriter were to recount the bare outlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pure Horatio Alger fantasy . Consider : Young boy , son of immigrant parents , grows up on a remote farm in the wilds near Strasburg , North Dakota . The family is poor , and life is a daily struggle to feed the eight little Welks . Always a sickly child , agonizingly shy  --  the kind of child who hid behind a chair and had to be dragged out when company came  --  the youngster is stricken with a ruptured appendix at age 11 . For seven weeks he hovers between life and death in a hospital and then spends a full year in convalescence at home . His education , which has been conducted up to that point by the Ursuline Sisters in the tiny parochial school in Strasburg , is summarily cut short , ending his formal education at the fourth grade . Because he grows up in a community composed almost entirely of German immigrants , the young man never learns to speak English until he leaves the farm at 21 . And yet this shy , frail , uneducated , desperately poor and inarticulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contemporary history and a man who confounded the experts by successfully riding the barracuda-infested waters of TV for over a quarter of a century . When you add to that some wideranging real estate holdings in Santa Monica and Escondido , six books , countless recordings , a healthy bank account and a warm and close family life , you have a success story even Horatio Alger would think twice about writing ! How did it all happen ? What got him there ? And what keeps him there ? " His magic personality , " said Bob Warren , instantly . Warren , who has announced the show for 25 years , adds , " I 'm with him in the studio every week , and I see what he does to an audience . He mesmerizes them . They ca n't take their eyes off him ! " Sam Lutz , his long-time personal manager , agrees that Lawrence has tremendous charisma , " and he always has had . But , " added Sam , " he also has a total dedication to his craft , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others . And his word is his bond . He and I had a handshake agreement back in 1946 ? something very rare in this business  --  and it has led to a wonderful , 34-year friendship . " Don Fedderson , the highly successful TV producer ( " My Three Sons , " " The Millionaire , " " Family Affair " and others ) , and the man who launched Welk into national television in 1955 , now heads the syndication operation . " Lawrence , " he said quietly , " has a God-given talent for making a living room out of a concert hall of ten or twenty thousand people and making a television viewer feel as if he 's the man next door . He 's an American institution . " But his creative-production people have slightly different viewpoints . George Cates , for example , who 's been his musical director since the Aragon Ballroom days on Lick Pier in Santa Monica back in the ' 40s , believes Welk 's success is because he reflects almost exactly the musical tastes of the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And also , " adds Cates , thoughtfully , " Lawrence appeals to ethnic groups  --  Europeans , Mexicans , Puerto Ricans  --  newcomers to this country . They do n't understand our situation comedies or sophisticated dramatic shows . But they can relate to his music ; they feel comfortable with it . Anyone with a musical heritage of any nationality can relate to his music . " Jim Hobson , Welk 's producer-director since the inception of the show , says it 's Lawrence 's " intuitive understanding . He just knows what 's best for the show  --  and he 's never wrong ! " All of them agree with Hobson that the show fills a deep-down need in most of us  --  a need to recapture the happier , simpler days of our youth when everything seemed much brighter and better . The Welk show , the Welk music  --  light , clean , full of happy memories  --  recreates that time for us , touches a chord of nostalgia deep within . " That 's not to say , " added Hobson , " that Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He plays all kinds  --  contemporary , Dixieland , light opera , even rock and roll . " It 's an eclectic mix of the best of rhythmic , melodic music . As Lawrence puts it , " if you ca n't hum it after we play it , then it 's not for us ! " But it may have been his longtime make-up man , Rudy Horvatich , who put his finger on one of the major reasons Lawrence holds the affection of so many people . Dabbing a coat of light make-up on Welk 's tanned face as he got him ready for the cameras , Horvatich said , quietly . " I think it 's Mr. Welk 's great concern for his fans . He 's so good to them . . . always thinking of ways to please them . I 've worked with every top star in the business and I 've never seen any ie as considerate and  --  and as king to his fans as Mr. Welk . " After ten years ' close association with Welk , collaborating on his books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence under the most trying circumstances and have never once seen him the least bit short with any of his fans . In fact , just as I was preparing this article , we flew to Portland , Oregon , to autograph his new book , flying up and back in one day and , as usual , he was inundated with requests for autographs . Flying home , one youngster kept coming back again and again for yet another autograph . Far from being annoyed , Lawrence seemed intrigued , and he signed each time with his usual flourish . ( He writes a large , flowing script , and the " L " in Lawrence looks very much like the signature on the treble clef , which somehow seems very fitting . ) At any rate , after the tenth request , he finally asked the little boy , " How come you want so many of my autographs ? " " Oh , " said the child , innocently , " I 'm selling them in the back of the plane for a dime . " That sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . Lawrence nearly fell out of his seat he laughed so hard . " That little boy , " he said , " will never go hungry . " His sense of humor is always near the surface , bubbling , irrepressible . And he loves to put people on . Just recently he came home from a luncheon where he was the honored guest and told his wife , Fern , that his speech was so bad the audience booed him . ( Not true . ) And he loves to tell stories on himself . " There was this lady who cut in on me at the Palladium one time . I had turned the baton over to Myron Floren , his star accordionist and gone down on the floor for a tag dance with the ladies . Well , most ladies are so gentle and polite , and they just tap you very lightly on the shoulder . But this lady  --  she was a little on the large side  --  she just came pushing through the crowd like this " ? Lawrence demonstrates , making swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap me , she slapped me so hard on the back I nearly fell down . Then she grabbed me the wrong way and started leading ! I tried to get her straightened around , but it turned out she had never danced before and we just tramped all over each other 's feet . Finally , she stopped and said , ' Mr. Welk , on television it looks like you 're a much better dancer ' ! " If others cite his humor or charm or charisma as reasons for his success , Lawrence himself takes a much more pragmatic view . " I think it 's because it took the boys and me longer to make the big time than any other orchestra . By the time we made it , we had really paid our dues . " That 's true . Nobody has paid more dues in this business than Lawrence , and he started paying them a long , long time ago , back on the farm in Strasburg , where the Welk family , children included , worked every day from dawn to dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring and summer and fall . In the wintertime , we had very few chores  --  and that 's the time I liked best of all , because then we had music . My father played accordion , my mother sang , we all danced . Those were happy times . " I had a recurrent dream in those years . . . so vivid I can still recall every detail today . In my dream , I was always standing in the center of a huge crowd  --  and they were smiling and applauding as I played my accordion . " For a small boy on a backwoods farm to dream such a dream might seem downright ludicrous . But Lawrence was obsessed by music  --  and so talented that he was playing tunes on the old family Continued on page 84 continued from page 55 pump organ when he was only three . As he grew older , he learned to play his father Ludwig 's accordion , which the elder Welk had brought from Odessa , Russia , when he immigrated to this country with his young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing for every barn dance and birthday party he could find in the neighborhood . And when he was 15 , he made up his mind to get off the farm and into music . " I was absolutely determined , " he says today . And so on March 11 , 1924 , in spite of his father 's adamant opposition , Lawrence left home ready to follow his dream . He had managed to talk his father into buying him a $400 accordion on his 17th birthday with the promise that he 'd stay on the farm until he was 21 and turn over everything he earned to the family . Now , his promise fulfilled to the letter , he shook hands with his father , kissed his mother good-bye and set off to conquer the world equipped with his accordion , high hopes and three one-dollar bills pinned inside his jacket . He ran into trouble immediately . His English was so bad he had trouble making himself understood . and he was so naive he had never even heard of divorce . But if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius for salesmanship and showmanship he still exhibits today . Sometimes he 'd try to get himself hired by the local theater in some small town . If he got turned down , he 'd say , " Well , why do n't you charge a nickel extra , and that will be my pay . " If that did n't work , he 'd throw in the clincher : " How about if you and I split the extra nickel , 50.50 ? " Almost always that worked ! Or if he was hungry , he 'd offer to play " dinner music " at the local coffee and hamburger joint . He got along . After a few rocky months , he was hired by a then-famous band , Lincoln Boulds ' Chicagoans . " Mr. Boulds told me over and over what a wonderful accordionist I was and raised my salary constantly . The only trouble was , he kept forgetting to pay me . " After six months of this , young Mr. Welk decided to put his own band together . By 1928 , Welk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WNAX in Yankton , South Dakota . The timing was perfect . Radio was just beginning to grow  --  and Welk grew with it . In a few months , Welk 's novelty orchestra was the most popular one for 400 miles around , and they played ballroom dates constantly . He met and married a beautiful young student nurse named Fern Renner , and in spite of the crash of ' 29 , played enough dances and radio broadcasts to keep his young bride well fed . Life was wonderful . But in 1931 , something happened which affected him so deeply it threatened to end his career . He and his band , grown to six pieces , were playing a dance in a small town . At the end of the evening , one of the fellows came to Welk and told him that the entire band was leaving . " But why ? " cried Lawrence . " We 're doing pretty good . Why would you want to leave ? " The musician , red-faced and embarrassed , tried to evade the question , but finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're leaving because you 're the one who 's holding us back ! You bounce around the stage like a hick ... you ca n't talk good English  --  you 're not even a good musi-cian ! " Welk was nearly destroyed by the incident . Not only was his personality being held up to ridicule , but his musicianship , the thing on which he 'd based his life . He felt his future was over , and for three days he languished in this small hotel bedroom , wondering whether to give up or not . After awhile , his natural optimism began to comeback . He pulled himself together , hired some temporary musicians to fulfill his already existing engagement , and began the long , slow climb back . " Today , " he said , " I can look back and be glad that happened . Up to that time I had believed everybody and trusted everyone . But that taught me to put my full faith only in God . Love people , yes , hope for the best , expect the best  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us hurt each other at times without really intending to . " The experience marked a turning point . " When Fern married me , I was determined to give her the best life possible . Now , with a new band , I worked day and night to improve it . " It paid off . The band grew from six pieces to eight to ten to sixteen . By 1939 , they had landed a spot playing at the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh  --  proof positive that they were edging into the world of the big bands . By 1940 , they began a ten-year tenure at the Trianon Ballroom in Chicago , with national recognition as the Miller High Life musical ambassador on radio . But at the end of the ' 40s , it all began to crumble again . Big bands were collapsing , ballrooms were out , television was in . Floundering , wondering what to do , Lawrence took the band back on the road . It was when they were performing at the old Aragon Ballroom in Los Angeles that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointments suffered in earlier times and all the painstakingly learned lessons of 30 years came together : Lawrence and television shook hands . KTLA , a local station , televised the band on opening night , roaming the an-cient ballroom , picking up the dancers , catching Lawrence 's by-play with the musicians . " I did n't think too much about it , " says Lawrence , " but the next day I went out to play golf and at least 20 people came up to say they 'd seen us on TV the night before and would be coming down to the ballroom . I had a sudden feeling that this was ' it , ' and I went home and told Fern , ' I think we 've made the right move . ' " He was right . Overnight the band was a local sensation . A few years later the Dodge Motor Company , which had sponsored them locally , put them on the air as a summer replacement , and they became a nationwide sensation . By the end of the 13-week run , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the band began its long-running love affair with America . That was 25 years ago . Today , the band is still riding high with 228 syndicated stations in this country and 38 in Canada and ratings , at this writing , among the highest in their history . Their concert tours are sold out . The gleaming white buildings of the Lawrence Welk Plaza , a block-long complex of business offices and apartment buildings overlooking the sea at Santa Monica , and the rapidly expanding Welk Country Club Village near Escondido , California  --  another complex of motels , restaurants , mobile homes and a golf course  --  all attest to the success of the band . Lawrence long ago achieved financial security and could certainly retire to a life of golf and sleep-late mornings if he wanted to . But he does n't . He seems just as energetic now as when he was first starting out . If he 's not taping a show or writing a book or competing in a golf tournament , then he 's on the road , and he 's apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kansas , where he surprised and delighted the local school kids by arriving early one morning to play his accordion for them ; in Nashville , Tennessee , where he surprised some more natives  --  and himself  --  by attending a rock concert ; in New York , where he appeared on the " Good Morning America " show , plugging his newest book , This I Believe . But when he 's home  --  he 's home ! He and Fern live very quietly in a spacious house overlooking the sea in Santa Monica . Fern cooks the simple food his nervous stomach requires and makes sure he gets the vitamins and minerals he needs . At night they read or watch TV on the giant-sized screen the orchestra presented Lawrence on his 75th birthday . They watch all kinds of shows , news particularly , but Saturday nights are reserved for the Welk show . " I enjoy it , but at the same time I learn from it . I 'm always looking for ways to make it better . " Lawrence truly loves to develop talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and he especially loves to find someone in whom nobody else has any faith and nurture them into stardom on the show , something he has done many times . Music has been his life , and always will be . But something else has claimed his attention in the past decade , and when he talks about it you see another side of this complex man , the serious side , the committed side that lies at the roots of his true character . " This is a wonderful country , " he says , quietly , " so wonderful , Nowhere else in the world could a man like myself  --  no education , no training , nothing  --  build such a beautiful life . I am just so grateful ! Every morning when I wake up , I look out the windows at all this beauty around us  --  and I just ca n't thank God enough . " I want to give back some of what I 've received to our country , and I ca n't think of a better way to do it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these years . I 'm convinced that it 's the reason for our success . I mean it ! It 's kept us on top when all the other bands faded away , and it 's kept us together and growing year after year . " When Lawrence explains his system , his eyes deepen and darken , his voice gets urgent . " Our system is a ' family ' system . We share  --  just as my brothers and sisters and I did , back on the farm . We are held together by a common purpose  --  no contracts , no legal ties . We stay together because we want to stay together , as a family does . And we take youngsters into our organization and train them as a family would , too , and when they become full-fledged members of the band , then we share our profits with them . " The one big roadblock , as Welk sees it , is the child labor law . " The most imContinued on page 87 Lawrence Welk continued from page 85 portant time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 18 . Children should be using those years to develop their talents and skills . But we have laws telling them they ca n't work to develop themselves ! I just thank God that I grew up at a time and in a place where there was freedom to develop your potential , with nobody around to stop you . I 'd like to give those gifts back to our young people today . " Lawrence Welk sits quietly , dreaming his dream just as he did 60 years ago when he was a small boy on the farm , and then he says softly , " I 'm proud of our orchestra , grateful and happy that we 've been able to make music for America for all these years , and I want to go right on doing " But if I could get the door open just a little for our young people , if I could help restore to this country some of the strength and moral courage we used to have , the freedom we must have to survive  --  then I would feel my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
