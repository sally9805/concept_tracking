When word came of Nancy Reagan 's mastectomy , how relieved we were to learn that the cancer had not spread to her lymph nodes . A small lesion like hers , confined to a quarter-inch spot , means an excellent prognosis . Because Mrs. Reagan 's father was a physician , as is her stepbrother , she undoubtedly has been having yearly mammograms as recommended by the guidelines of the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) and the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) . Sadly , she is in the minority . Medical data suggest that only about 15 to 20 percent of American women age 50 and over have ever had a mammogram and that an even much smaller proportion is being examined with systematic regularity . If your own mother is in the unprotected majority , the nicest Christmas gift from you this year might be your taking her by the hand and accompanying her to the nearest hospital or breast clinic for a reassuring , safe mammogram on dedicated mammography equipment . It has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that ear-Her detection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Preliminary results from a screening study in Holland suggest that deaths in women 35 and over can be reduced by about 50 percent through regular mammographic screening of all eligible women . When we first began sending the MAMMOBILE around the country to find out why women were n't being mammogramed , we learned a lot in a hurry . The women who had n't been mammogramed were from all socioeconomic levels ; we stationed our vehicle on inner-city church parking lots as well as on the Capitol plaza . We mammogramed such women as Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado and Dede Robertson , the wife of the presidential candidate Pat Robertson . We interviewed Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio to learn about her proposed legislation that wouldmake it possible for Medicare to pay for mammography for all women , not just those found to have breast-cancer symptoms . A recent issue of Ca-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians , published by the ACS , lamented : " Too many physicians are withholding mammography in the absence of symptoms , at a time when the main purpose of mammography is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The article reports that a variety of studies in the past 15 years suggest that " physicians regard mammography as a relatively unimportant prevention strategy , even for women age 50 and older . " In 1980 , a record review at a general hospital in Cleveland showed that only 4 percent of eligible women age 50 to 60 received a mammogram during their usual care , " the article reported . " In another study , from 1978 to 1980 , only 2 percent of women age 50 to 70 at a general medicine clinic in Indianapolis received mammography during their usual care . " One study showed a sizable positive relationship between education and mammography experience : " Among women who attended college , 18 percent reported having had a mammogram , compared with 12 percent for those with a high-school education and 9 percent for the grade-school group . " In the past it has been noted that Jewish women showed a higher prevalence of breast cancer . In the study reported by the NCI , Jewish women showed a much higher mammography usage rate than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in metropolitan areas reported higher mammography use ( 24 percent ) than those in the suburbs ( 21 percent ) or in nonmetropolitan areas ( 12 percent ) , according to the survey . The Ca-A Cancer Journal also reports : " A recent survey by The Saturday Evening Post indicates that the absence of physician recommendations is the greatest deterrent to the use of mammography . Among the respondents over age 50 who were not having annual mammograms , 64 percent gave as a reason that it was not suggested by their physicians . " The article pointed out that few attempts have been made to alter the attitudes and practices of physicians and patients regarding mammography . The report continued , " By any preventive criterion , the level of mammography usage in the U.S. leaves much room for improvement . " Society members may be gratified by the results of the MAMMOBILE program that they support . In the first two years of operation , there have been positive findings in 10.8 percent of the mammograms given . We expected this high percentage since we have largely been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never had mammograms before . Percentages of positive results were far higher in some locations . For example , from 42 mammograms at a health fair in Washington , D.C. , we found 12 positives , or 29 percent . In Congress , we did 211 mammograms and found 33 positives , or 16 percent . Yet in the Second Baptist Church in Houston , where we did 163 mammograms , we had only 12 positives , or 7 percent . Similar better results came from Lover 's Lane United Methodist Church in Dallas , where in 89 mammograms we found only 7 positives , * or 8 percent . Our efforts are threefold : ( 1 ) to help reduce deaths from breast cancer in the women who need the free tests ; ( 2 ) to motivate many more women to seek mammography on their own by exposing them to the MAMMOBILE and the educational videocassettes and printed material it distributes ; ( 3 ) to provide epidemiological and behavioral information to researchers who can use our surveys . Do n't Forget Alzheimer 's Dear Dr. SerVaas : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's or AIDS ? " October 1987 ) was timely and informative . The AIDS epidemic appears to be spreading . And our population is increasingly an aging one . Under these circumstances , opportunities for incorrectly diagnosing AIDS-related dementia as Alzheimer 's disease may become increasingly abundant . Particularly in view of the prevalence of these disorders , I believe it is vitally important to publish articles , such as the one in the Post , seeking to draw public attention to AIDS-associated dementia and Alzheimer 's and their attendant signs and symptoms . This may potentially help avoid situations where someone 's apparent loss of memory and mental functioning is simply " shrugged off " as symptomatic of " old age . " Leo Uzych Wallingford , Pennsylvania Slow-Mag and Alcoholism Dear Dr. SerVaas : Some time ago I was given the September ' 87 issue of The Saturday Evening Post .

Fjetland wrote about an article on SlowMag , which has helped her in her fight against alcoholism . Would it be at all possible to have a copy of that article , which hopefully will explain for me what Slow-Mag is ? So far I have been unable to find anyone who can give me any information on this . A few years ago an article in your magazine on herpes and cold sores introduced me to L-lysine , and I have never had the problem again .

Tag Lines Dear Dr. SerVaas : I 've been following the articles relating to skin tags and colon cancer . My brother has had a colostomy . I alternate between diarrhea and constipation , mostly the former . I am quite concerned . I am 66 and want to avoid my brother 's problem if I can . The upper portion of my body is covered with skin tags , so in view of my intestinal problems and the tags I am afraid . My doctor is n't concerned about the skin tags and says I have a nervous colon . What can I do ? Name withheld Do you have regular stool checks for occult blood ? Do you have sigmoidoscopies or colonoscopies ? This involves having a look at the inside of the colon with a fiberoptic scope . You can even see your insides with an extra viewing lens while the gastroenterologist works his way up your colon with the tiny flashlight .

AIDS Info Dear Dr. SerVaas : I recently heard a segment of a TV show about your work with the AIDS project . I did n't get to hear the entire program , but you did invite inquiries into your work . Please send me any information you have for distribution  --  also info on testing . Betty M. Diezman Escondido , California We are sending you information about our AIDS MOBILE . The Society is presently working with Teen Challenge programs to test young people who were formerly needle-sharing drug users and have now been rehabilitated . Since learning about the Lord , they no longer indulge in drugs or illicit sex . Unfortunately , however , many of them are now AIDS positive from having made a wrong turn earlier in life . Because of the Teen Challenge program , they know that they will be supported by ministers and physicians if they are found to be AIDS positive .

If you are a new reader , you may want to know about the SOFT AIDS program this society is sponsoring . It encourages women to give blood and supports bereaved women whose husbands , brothers , and sons have AIDS or have died from AIDS . CMT Dear Dr. SerVaas : I have CMT ( Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ) , of which not much is known . They have found , however , fundamental defects of lipid ( fat ) metabolism in several inherited neuromuscular diseases clinically similar to CMT . Are there any vitamins or food or medication which could slow down or arrest this degeneration of myelin ? My doctor does n't have any faith in treating diseases with diet or vitamins . Mildred L. Clinch Munnsvilte , New York Thank you for your letter about CMT . We 're printing it in the hopes that somewhere there is a medical researcher working on CMT who will write to tell us something encouraging . We have n't found anything about a cure or prevention in the medical literature as yet , but please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think of the story of pernicious anemia , which caused people to die  --  hence the name " pernicious . " Imagine the good news when it was discovered that a tiny amount of vitamin 1312 could reverse almost all of the symptoms of this vexing killer . I am sending information on pernicious anemia , because it too has a hereditary component , and it too causes a chronic degeneration of the peripheral nerves . I thought it might encourage you not to give up writing to doctors and researching the problem , both for yourself and for your offspring . on 93 Nearly 47,000 soldiers were diagnosed with scurvy from vitamin-C deficiency during the Civil War . Pellagra was a mysterious and untreatable scourge until 1937 , when we learned it was caused by a deficiency of niacin , a member of the vitamin B complex . As the pioneer surgeon Simon Baruch said , " There are no such things as incurable , there are only things for which man has not found a cure . " Do n't you like that ? Just get in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for your sake , I hope it is for CMT . Damned Spot Dear Dr. SerVaas : Thank God that Mr. Gerald Malky wrote a follow-up letter on his melanoma and the finding of a second mole and that his letter appeared in your column . Last year , strictly because I had passed my 45th birthday , I went to my doctor for a routine checkup . At that time I mentioned that I suffered from a stiffness in my neck and that a mole on my thigh itched from time to time . He looked at the mole with a magnifying glass and said it looked all right to him and prescribed aspirin for my neck . I went home confident since I had a doctor look at the mole , and at this time I knew nothing about melanoma . This year , in late July , my neck began to act up again , and I went back to my doctor . He sent me to the hospital for a series of tests . While I was waiting to be called in for X-ray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . Lo and behold , the page fell open to the enclosed article . I was called in for my tests and did not have lime to read the whole thing , but I saw enough to let me know that mole was coming off . So when I went back to the doctor for the results of my X-rays , I told the doctor about your article and requested that the mole be removed and checked . He again said he thought the mole was harmless , but if it made me feel better he would remove it . Three A normal mole ( 1 ) is an evenly colored brown , tan , or black spot either flat or raised . It may be round or oval and will have sharply defined borders . A malignant mole , on the other hand , will be asymmetrical ( 2 ) , with irregular or blurred borders ( 3 ) , and mottled shades ( 4 ) . It may increase suddenly in size ( 5 ) and become scaly , or it will ooze or bleed ( 6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went to my local library to gel a copy of your original article , which appeared in the September ' 86 issue , and am reading everything I can lay my hands on about this silent killer . Fortunately , this malignancy was still in its early stages and no others were found , but you can be sure we will be watching more closely now . Today my husband and I are celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and are looking forward to the birth of another grandchild . The fact that you ran this follow-up so I could happen to see it may result in many more anniversaries and years of enjoying my wonderful family and , friends . Also , while paging through old copies of your magazine to find the enclosed article again , I found I have been missing some good , informative written material and am ordering a subscription to your magazine . P.S.

Eventually it Family Tradition Dear Dr. SerVaas : I have hemorrhoids and have had them for a number of years . My parents had them too , so I have always thought it was hereditary . Could you tell me the difference between " internal " hemorrhoids and " external " hemorrhoids ? Since I added fiber to my diet , my hemorrhoids seem to be improving . Before adding fiber , I was often constipated . I eat All-Bran and whole-wheat bread every day . Boring , but it helps . Name withheld As you probably know , hemorrhoids are varicose veins that drain blood from the rectum and anus . When they appear in the upper rectum they are called " internal " hemorrhoids , and when situated at the junction of the rectum and anus , they are known as " external " hemorrhoids .

According to the articles I have read , ocular histoplasmosis is a fungus , but that is about all that is known . I was told that there has not been much research because , as one of the doctors said ? " There is no profit in it . " So , I am turning to you  --  can you refer me to anybody in this world who can help or know something about histo ? Are there any clinics or people that specialize in retina or maculae disease ?
