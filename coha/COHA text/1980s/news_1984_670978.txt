Doctors attending the girl , who was described only as Baby Fae , said through a hospital spokesman that they were " very pleased " with the early postoperative results . However , they listed the baby in critical condition in the hospital ' s intensive care unit . That is standard for any patient who has undergone open-heart surgery. // The doctors said Baby Fae had been born with a severe birth defect , hypoplastic heart syndrome , which made the left side of her heart much smaller than the right side . Baby Fae " almost died on her sixth day " of life , said Joyce McClintock , a spokesman for the medical center. // Yesterday Baby Fae was " stirring and opening her eyes " and breathing with the help of a mechanical respirator , according to a hospital official. // The heart of a baboon somewhere between " 4 months and 1 year " of age was used because a compatible human heart was not available , Mrs. McClintock said . She said that if the operation proved successful , Dr. Leonard L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , expected the baboon ' s heart to grow at a normal rate as Baby Fae did . The prediction was based on animal experiments. // Six baboons that were housed at Loma Linda were initially selected for the compatibility tests . After extensive immunological testing , the potential donors were narrowed to two baboons and then one . " It ' s really uncanny , " one of the doctors said , " because we never thought we could actually get the data to support selection of one primate donor over another. " // The doctors said they had detected no other birth defects or conditions in Baby Fae after thorough examinations by specialists in the nervous system , genetics , kidney disease and other fields. // The operation is the first of five using baboon hearts planned by doctors at Loma Linda University , which is near Riverside , about 60 miles from Los Angeles . The animal-to-human transplant experiments were approved by the university ' s ethics committee although Mrs. McClintock said she did not know when the approval was granted. // The series of experiments give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to use animals as a source of organs for transplantation . If the new effort with Baby Fae and other humans succeeds , doctors might overcome the shortage of donor human hearts . That shortage has appeared to be an insurmountable barrier to widespread application of heart transplant programs . <> <> Ethics of Using Animals // // The success of cross-species transplants could be expected to open up new avenues of research into heart disease as well as raise some thorny ethical questions , Dr. Claude J. Lenfant , director of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , said in an interview. // Dr. Bailey indicated he was aware of the ethical issues. // " We ' re not in the business of uselessly sacrificing animals , " he said in a news release issued yesterday . " But we ' re forced here to make a choice . We can either decide to continue to let these otherwise healthy human babies die , because they are born with only half of their heart , or we can intervene and , in so doing , sacrifice some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey noted the similarities and differences in anatomy of simian and human hearts. // " The baboon has only two arch vessels , while the human heart usually has three , " he said , referring to the aortic arch , " but for all practical purposes , the internal structure of the baboon heart is virtually the same as the human heart . " <> <> Earlier Attempts Failed // // While four earlier efforts to use ape hearts dating to 1964 all failed , this new effort comes when organ transplants are meeting with much greater success than ever before . The reasons for better success include a wider body of scientific knowledge as well as the development of improved tests to detect the rejection phenomenon and drugs to fight it since the first human- to-human heart transplant was done in 1967. // Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard performed the first successful human heart transplant at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town , South Africa , and doctors in many centers elsewhere quickly joined in after learning that such transplants were technically feasible. // The death rates were appalling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rejecting the donated heart , and almost all centers abandoned the attempts . The striking exception was Dr. Norman Shumway ' s program at Stanford University in California. // In 1977 Dr. Barnard developed a new approach to heart transplant surgery by piggy-backing ape hearts to the failing hearts of two patients . In one operation Dr. Barnard piggy-backed a baboon ' s heart and the patient died hours after the operation . In the other , he used a chimpanzee ' s heart ; the patient died three and one-half days later. // But Dr. Barnard soon gave up on that approach because of the rejection phenomenon , saying that " we will go ahead again " when better antirejection drugs were developed . Dr. Barnard also said in an interview in 1978 that he abandoned the technique of using ape hearts in humans " not because I ' m so convinced I ' m on the wrong track , but I got emotionally involved with the chimp. " // Experts have credited the new surge of transplantation activity to the development of the drug cyclosporin-A . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if the baboon transplant would have been done if cyclosporin-A was not available , she said she did not know. // Dr. Lenfant of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute said in an interview that the Federal institute had not provided financial support to the Loma Linda group for its baboon transplant experiments. // Mrs. McClintock said the Loma Linda doctors and medical center were donating their services to Baby Fae ' s care . But she said she did not know if any Federal , state or health insurance funds would be used. // Dr. Lenfant said officials at the institute " would follow the experiments with interest . " He expressed concern about the possibility of complications that might result from long-term use of cyclosporin-A . He said he presumed that because of the crossing of the species barrier , the dosage of cyclosporin- A might be higher than in transplants of human hearts. // Although the success rates of heart transplants have improved significantly at Stanford and several other centers that have begun to do them again using cyclosporin-A , the procedure is still reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have little chance for survival . <> <> Age as Survival Factor // Doctors have found that younger patients generally have better survival rates , and doctors have usually set an arbitrary upper age limit of 50 years for potential recipients of human heart transplants. // As the success rates have improved , transplant surgeons have become bolder in giving hearts to younger people . Last August , doctors in London transplanted a heart into 9-day-old Hollie Ruffey , who suffered from the same hypoplastic heart birth defect condition that affected Baby Fae in California . Hollie Ruffey was the world ' s youngest heart-transplant recipient and she died less than three weeks later. // Baby Fae ' s heart had an inadequate left ventricle , the main pumping chamber of the organ , according to Mrs. McClintock . The birth defects also affected the two valves on the left side of Baby Fae ' s heart and her aorta , the main artery leading from the heart. // Since Baby Fae was admitted to Loma Linda University Medical Center on Oct. 19 , doctors sustained her life by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a mechanical respirator , for example . In another effort to sustain circulation , the doctors prescribed a prostaglandin- type drug to treat a condition called a patent ductus. // //
