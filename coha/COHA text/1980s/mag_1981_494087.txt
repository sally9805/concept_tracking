THE POLISH COUP In 1976 Gerald Ford asserted that the Soviet Union does not dominate Poland . He paid for that blunder with the presidency . Mr. Ford must be wondering today what the fuss was all about . To hear European and American governments describe the army takeover in Poland as an " internal affair , " one would think they were talking about the rotation of generals in a Latin American junta , not the reassertion of repressive power in a Soviet satellite . French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson said that the Polish situation was a strictly internal matter , and added that France intended to do " absolutely nothing " about it . Britain and West Germany contented themselves with declarations of strict nonintervention and the hope that other Helsinki signatories would agree . The Reagan Administration 's first reaction was to warn against " outside interference " ? as if the history of Poland since 1945 had been anything other than a history of outside ( that is , Soviet ) interference , domination , occupation , exploitation , and oppression . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did n't take a Henry Kissinger to realize that the Polish crackdown would never have happened " without Soviet pressure , without 30 Soviet divisions on their borders , without the constant threat of Soviet intervention , and without the Communist Party ideology , which is universal , that you can not have independent organizations in a Communist state . " But it did take Henry Kissinger to say it . And it took Zbigniew Brzezinski to call the army takeover for what it was : " a Soviet invasion by proxy . " But the distinction between internal measures and external intervention has been the recurrent theme of both American and European official reaction . This fiction serves an important diplomatic purpose . As long as Western governments can pretend the Soviets have no hand in Polish actions , they can consider themselves free of any responsibility to act . In fact , a " Polish solution " would be the best the Soviets could hope for , and it is precisely what they have been demanding ever since Solidarity came into existence last year . An independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms and a threat to its power . But a Warsaw Pact invasion to suppress Solidarity would risk not only armed resistance from the Poles but also possible disruption of badly needed credits from and trade with the West . With an internal solution , the Soviets can have their imperial cake and detente , too . It is one thing to lose one 's political bearings by pretending that the Soviets have nothing to do with what is happening in Poland . It is quite another to fail to condemn unequivocally the Polish coup and its clear attempt to throttle the liberty that Solidarity had begun to win . That is to lose one 's moral bearings , as the Washington Post did in an editorial headlined " General Iaruzelski 's Burden , " a sympathetic view of a Polish Hamlet . " It is an ugly thing to watch a Communist general . . . crack down on a brave popular workers ' movement , " the Post conceded . " But as long as he appears also to be serving a second purpose ? saving from Soviet vengeance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's struggle and sacrifice over the last 16 months ? he deserves the cautious regard he has been getting from the Reagan Administration and other governments . " If " cautious regard " is due the perpetrators of the Polish coup , it should come from the East , not the West . General Jaruzelski is not the first respected national military hero to take power in the name of preserving the existence of the state and averting the vengeance of an imperial neighbor . Marshal Main showed the way 40 years ago , and by doing Germany 's dirty work he made France 's life ? and her virtue ? easier than it would have been otherwise . Others point out that Jaruzelski was sorely provoked by Solidarity 's rash demands for a national referendum . Senator Percy , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , said he understood that this demand was " intolerable , " and noted that even in the U.S. we " do not run our government by referendum . " But then , we do not need national referenda in the U.S. because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , elections . In fact , Solidarity called for a referendum only in the event that the government refused its offer of a genuine coalition . Mr. Percy confuses the provoked with the provocateurs . Solidarity has been in continual struggle since its birth because the government reneged on most of the promises it made in the Gdansk agreements of 1980 ( like free access to the press ) and because , for the past year , the Party has sought to blame Solidarity for the accumulated failures of 30 years of Communist rule . Those who view Jaruzelski as having been pushed to impose martial law not by the Soviets but by Walesa and the " radicals " in Solidarity also tend to take a certain view of Jaruzelski 's intentions . They believe that he intends to be true to the words of his nationwide address : that he has no thought of rolling back the clock to pre-August 1980 , that he is seeking merely a cooling-off period to establish order , that he must settle the country down so he can continue its " socialist renewal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have our doubts . What else could Jaruzelski have done in his address to the nation but appeal to patriotism ? An appeal to Party loyalty or to building socialism would have been met with derision ? or open revolt . That is why he took control by means of the army ? one of the three national institutions that enjoys the respect of the people ( along with Solidarity and the Church ) , and the only one of the three that can be relied upon to support the central power of the state . Jaruzelski may not have a media adviser , but he does know how to use symbols in appealing to his people . He made sure to scapegoat a few already disgraced Party leaders . Jailing the hapless Edward Gierek ? an otherwise empty gesture ? to balance the abduction of Lech Walesa denotes a certain devotion to symmetry and symbolism . Jaruzelski even had state television news-readers donning military uniforms on camera ( same newsreader in new garb ? like having Dan Rather suddenly appear in brass buttons ) and ordered the military to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaruzelski did promise a return to " socialist renewal " after the temporary aberration of army rule . But the history of Communist coups in Eastern Europe and elsewhere ? and Jaruzelski has , in effect , retaken power for Communism ? does not bode well for promise-keeping by their leaders . Marxist-Leninists tend to respond more to the " correlation of forces " than to past promises . And it is the existing correlation of forces in Poland that has been shattered by martial law . So many unexpected , indeed impossible , things have happened in Poland during the past 16 months that it would be a mistake to shut out hope entirely . A people can be crushed but a people can not be crushed easily . Whatever else may happen , it would be a mistake to expect the simple restoration of the kind of Party dictatorship that existed before August 1980 . It would also be a mistake to be confident about the capacity of Solidarity to withstand the blow delivered last week to the delicate balance of power in Poland . Before martial law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a kind of strategic umbrella : each side had an ultimate weapon so powerful it was unthinkable to use it . The government had the army and Solidarity the general strike . Because it was thought that neither side would or could successfully exercise its ultimate power , a kind of deterrence prevailed , forcing the parties to negotiate and seek accommodation . Now the government has done the unthinkable , perhaps the impossible , of trying to suppress a popular revolution with the army . But if the workers are not able to mobilize and resist with an effective strike , the balance of forces in Poland could change radically and perhaps irrevocably . It was never legality or love of democracy that made the Polish authorities agree to Solidarity 's existence in the first place , but rather an irresistible popular force . If that force proves not irresistible but containable by repression , the workers ' movement may be weakened , perhaps fatally . Assume that this happens , that Solidarity does not resist , that the Polish people , however slowly , acquiesce to army rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most benign of intentions , what possible incentive could he have not to complete what he had begun ? Why permit Solidarity to reestablish itself and take Poland to " the abyss " yet again some day in the future ? There seems little logic to the crackdown if it is meant as a temporary measure . Its object seems to be to break Solidarity , if possible . We hope the Polish people will not permit that to happen . Besides hope , what can the West do ? First , we must be prepared to condemn , not just deplore , what has happened : the imposition of martial law , the arrest of Solidarity 's leaders , the suspension of the most elementary civil liberties , and the attempt to break the union . If the United States does not call unequivocally for an end to these actions , who will ? And if we do not , the Poles will be further demoralized when they learn that we are too timid even to express support for their freedom . Furthermore , though it is clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have considerable economic leverage . We have sent the Poles almost a billion dollars of food aid . Secretary Haig has declared suspension of further aid , although not what is now " in the pipeline . " It is hard to fathom the reason for this purely formal distinction between pipeline and nonpipeline aid . If we want to exert whatever leverage we have over the Polish state , the time to do it is now ? not when pipeline shipments run out . And rather than cutting off food completely , it would be more effective to declare that we will give it directly to Solidarity for distribution to the Polish people , or , ' when that offer is refused , to the Church . We can also make it clear that we do n't believe in the fiction of Soviet nonintervention . We can say quietly to the Soviets and the Polish authorities that if Poland does not resume what Mr. Haig calls its " political experiment , " we will refuse to continue to extend credit to Poland and the rest of the Soviet bloc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans that the U.S. has already rescheduled . We should make it clear that we will tolerate no more rescheduling and that we will urge allied governments and Western banks to do the same . ( They will probably refuse to follow our lead . In fact , the New York Times reports that " European bankers ... expressled relief at the crackdown in the hopethat the Poles will now be pressed to improve their work habits , produce more , and pay off their debts to the West , which now amount to nearly $27 billion . " ) Nevertheless , U.S. willingness to write off bad Eastern European debts and deny further credit to the crumbling economies of the Soviet bloc will send an unmistakable message to Moscow that we do not accept the new status quo in Poland and that we hold Poland 's fraternal " socialist " allies responsible . But boycotting arms control negotiations in Geneva would be a mistake . Not because there is something sacred about continuing negotiations in the face of provocation , but because the control of nuclear arms is a vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because a boycott would only give the now quiescent and sobered European neutralists cause once again to shift attention away from Communist repression toward " American intransigence " instead . No one believes that such steps can be decisive . But they may help sway decisions made at the margin . Constant talk of empty threats if the Soviets intervene is worse than useless . If they are taken seriously , Soviet and Polish authorities will simply be given all the more reason to ensure that the current " Polish solution " succeeds ? it would make a Soviet invasion superfluous . There are certain concrete steps that the U.S. can take now . There is a question , first of all , of our own self-respect . There is also a question of doing what little we can to help the first genuine mass workers ' movement in the Communist world . It is time for the U.S. government to stop talking about the need for stability . Americans may have given up John Kennedy 's promise to " bear any burden " for liberty , but we should at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those in Poland who are willing to take up that burden .
