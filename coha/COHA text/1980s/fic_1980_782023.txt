 | " Sure  --  so we 'll arrive after dark  --  no big deal , we 'll turn on the lights . " In Matty 's big Cadillac they drove up Route 101 to Carmel . There Matty turned back down the coast , taking Route 1 , the narrow , twisting , dangerous coast road , and drove thirty miles to a vacation cabin he and Margo owned in the Ventana Wilderness of Big Sur . The cabin , almost invisible from the steeply rising dirt road which climbed up to it , was built of weathered , local redwood . It had running water , electricity and heat since the Firestones had discovered that even in the summer Big Sur can be bitterly cold at night . Margo had furnished it with sturdy American antiques from Carmel and had used old quilts for bed covers and upholstery . From the small clearing of wild grasses in front of the cabin , which was tucked among redwoods , aspens and sycamores , there was a view straight out over the Pacific Ocean , a thousand feet below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and the ocean looked calm and harmless . When Francesca gazed down at the sea on the following morning , she saw a coastline that is not equaled for elemental beauty anywhere on earth . She sensed that gods and goddesses had walked there and she felt an intimation of safety beginning to grow in her . She had never been to Greece but something about the absolute serenity of the steep wooded knolls that rose directly from the water made Francesca feel that this was a place protected by forces of which she knew nothing . The cabin was part of nature . After the Firestones went back to Los Angeles , blacktail deer began to appear at the edge of the clearing and the coast jays soon learned to join them when Francesca and Masha fed the babies outdoors , stealing food from their plates . There , in the Ventana Wilderness , Francesca held her little household together . Sometimes in the all but overwhelming remoteness of the Big Sur country , Francesca thought that she had bitten right out into the very edge of her soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more courage , no more patience , no more strength to give to her children , but she never broke . Intact . That was the word that was always on her mind . Year after year she kept them intact ; Daisy , who crackled so with energy that when Francesca managed to capture one of her busy hands she expected to receive an electric shock , and Dani , who , at three and a half , could walk upstairs only if she held on to the railing , and then only by putting  | one foot on each tread and then the other so that it took her an eternity to creep to her bedroom ; Daisy who sang long , rhyming songs to anyone who would listen and could name every animal in the picture books and every flower in the woods and could put away every object in the kitchen in its proper place and take her own bath and brush her own teeth ; and Dani who built towers only two blocks high , who knew how to turn three or four pages of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , and who understood only the simplest of verbal instructions . Yet it was with Dani that Francesca found her most peaceful and harmonious moments . Dani 's eyes , like a baby 's eyes , seemed to remember something of a previous life which could n't be communicated , but which reassured and comforted her . Dani 's vulnerability was her strength , since no one saw her without feeling the impulse to protect her . Dani was never unhappy because she was never frustrated . If she could n't do something , she did n't bang furiously on the table the way Daisy did when she first discovered that she did n't know how to read . Dani did n't ask endless questions , did n't plague Francesca with demands to climb a tree , catch an earthworm , make cookies , train a hummingbird , take a walk in the woods and collect pebbles on the beach  --  all in the same breath , as Daisy did . Every week Margo or Matty Firestone would telephone to find out how they were faring , and Francesca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was well with her . She was so caught up in the intensity of her maternal feelings that she had no time to regret the years during which she had been a movie star or the months during which she had been a princess . Love for Daisy and Danielle  --  and fear for them  --  isolated her more than any other emotion she had ever known . She , who had had within her something as powerful as a huge magnet that had irresistibly attracted many , many men into her field of force , now allowed that magnet to become just another piece of inert material . Occasionally she would consider briefly her solitary life , hidden from the world , and remember the days when she had loved Stash . She would murmur a few lines from Hamlet There lies within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it , ? and return to the present , remembering only that Ophelia had always been a part she had disliked . " I do n't understand her , " Matty said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not go totally bananas stuck up there all alone with only Masha and the kids to keep her company ? What kind of life is it for her , I ask you ? It does n't make sense . " " She 's playing the greatest role of her life , " Margo answered . " Bullshit . That 's what you said when she was doing the princess number . " " Matty , you really still do n't get it , do you ? That whole princess thing was a lightweight farce compared to being the tigress mother . Now she has those two precious babies to protect and bring up and she does n't need anything else  --  not men or acting or even friends . It 'll change as they get older , I guess , but right now she 's absorbed in them to the exclusion of everything . Nothing , nothing has any other meaning for her . " " That was some great idea you had , to take her to Europe , " Matty sighed in incurable despair . " If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest star in the business ... " " Do n't look back , Matty . It does n't help . " Daisy had started to talk a steady stream of jargon at about fifteen months , spaced with clear-cut , well-pronounced names and a few demands . By the age of two she was spontaneously combining words into short sentences , using pronouns and verbalizing her immediate experience . " Daisy not afraid of thunder , " she would announce , grabbing Masha 's hand and squeezing it hard . Anxiously , Francesca waited for signs of speech development in Dani , who could say " Mama , " " Asha " for Masha and " Day " for Daisy , but instead she heard only occasional sounds which were utterly without meaning , gibberish composed of distorted and unarticulated syllables . She waited and patiently tried to teach Dani , but the little girl added only a few basic words  --  like " yes " and " no " and " bird " and " hot " ? to her vocabulary . However , to Francesca 's horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fear cold in her bones , as the twins communicated with each other in the way of idiots . She was afraid to say anything about it to Daisy , hoping that if she did n't mention the strange phenomenon it would go away . Instead , it got worse . Finally , when they had passed their third birthday , Francesca asked , as casually as possible , " Daisy , what are you and Dani talking about ? " " She wanted to play with my dolly but when I gave it to her she did n't want it anymore . " " Why do you talk to Dani that way , Daisy ? " " What way ? "  | " The way you just did  --  all those funny noises . Not the way you talk to me . " " But that 's just the way she talks , Mama . " " Can you understand everything she says ? " " Of course . " " What else do you talk about ? " " I do n't know . " Daisy looked puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was putting the twins to bed , Francesca heard the strange sounds start up again . " What did she say just now , Daisy ? " " Dani said , more kiss . That means she wants you to give her another goodnight kiss . " " Could n't you teach her to say kiss , Daisy , the way you say it ? " " I do n't know . I do n't think so . " " Will you try ? " " Yes , Mama . More kiss for me , too ? " That night Francesca spoke to Masha about the twins ' strange form of communication . " Yes , I 've noticed it many , many times , Madame , " Masha answered slowly . " It reminds me of something from Russia ? something I heard when I was growing up  --  it must have been about fifty years ago . There were twins  --  boys they were  --  who lived in the village nearest to ours and I still remember my mother and my aunt whispering to each other about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in a language nobody could understand . People thought perhaps they were . . . they did n't know ? " " Were they normal , Masha ? " " Oh , yes , Madame . They stopped doing it when they got older and by the time they were six or so everyone thought they had just forgotten it . They talked just like everyone else . But then I left , to go to St. Petersburg , and that 's all I can tell you  --  about them or about anyone else in that village , " she finished sadly . Francesca knew few other people to consult about this problem , or any other problem in her life . She was living in the most isolated way possible , except for the phone calls from Matty and Margo . Francesca understood that if reporters were to come across the fact that Francesca Vernon Valensky lived in Big Sur with two identical twin children , she would be hounded to the ends of the earth , until the whole evil story was discovered . She was not protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had done .  | Whenever she had to drive into Carmel for supplies that could n't be found in the tiny general store that supplied the few , scattered permanent residents of the area , she left both children at home with Masha and wore such concealing clothes and head scarfs and sunglasses that she was never recognized . She dared not make friends . No friends , old or new , could be trusted except Matty and Margo . She lived frugally , accepting the cabin without shame , for her children 's sake . One by one , through Margo , she sold the jeweled flowers in the crystal vases . Each object was worth only some fifteen hundred dollars to a Beverly Hills dealer , but fifteen hundred dollars could keep the four of them for six months . She guarded the lapis egg for last , when the flowers would be gone . Margo had described it to a salesman at A la Veille Russie in New York , who said that if it were genuine Faberge it might be worth up to twenty or thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't doubt  --  it was her only security . She cursed herself to sleep night after night thinking of the jewels she had so proudly and foolishly left behind , thinking of the money she had made in Hollywood and casually spent , every penny of it , on clothes and cars and books and extravagant presents to her parents and friends . From time to time Matty would send her a script some hopeful producer had given him to " pass on if you can . " For the first three years Francesca refused all these offers without thinking about it because she could n't dream of leaving Masha alone to cope with the two children for months at a time . Two years after Francesca 's flight , Stash had a letter from Matty Firestone . He was informed that Francesca believed that Daisy , now three years old , needed to know her father . She would permit him to visit the child four times a year , for three consecutive days , four hours at a time , provided that he do so without making any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was told to go to the Highlands Inn in Carmel and wait . Stash left London that same morning . A few hours after he arrived , the desk clerk told him that he had visitors . In the rustic lobby Masha was waiting for him with Daisy holding her hand tightly . There was no sign of Francesca or Danielle . Stash asked Masha no questions , none at all , and she volunteered nothing but a quiet greeting to the man she had once suckled at her breast . At the end of the first hours with his strong , brave and beautiful daughter , Stash drew pictures for her , stick figures of a man and a  | little girl adorned with big red hearts . He explained to her that whenever she received one of these in the mail it would mean that he had been thinking about her every day . He mailed one every two or three days until his next visit . The minute he was alone with her he asked her if she had received them . " Yes , Daddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " Do you remember what they mean ? " " That you think about me . " " Do you keep them ? " " Oh , yes , Daddy , I keep them . " " Where do you keep them , Daisy darling ? " " I give them to Dani . " " Oh . " " She likes to play with them . " " Daisy , let 's go and look at the kitten . " Each time that he returned to London from California , Stash willed himself not to start counting the weeks until he could see Daisy again . He failed utterly . He was unable to resist the temptation of consulting a judge he knew personally , telling him nothing of the existence of Danielle , but merely explaining that after his separation , his wife had restricted his access to his child . The only remedies open to him , he soon was made to understand , would have to involve publicity . Stash was advised to wait . Often , in cases such as his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly as the child herself can be influenced more strongly as she gains in maturity . So he waited , with the same wolfish , undefeated yet helplessly impotent fury that he had known during his first year in the RAF ; yet he never contemplated anything but victory . If not now , then soon . By the time Daisy was five , the child was providing real help around the cabin , making both her bed and Dani 's , cleaning the room they shared , drying dishes , watering and expertly weeding the vegetable garden . Francesca , who had just received a letter from Matty enclosing yet another script , a good one , explained to Daisy that she might have to go away for a short time to do some work which would earn some money for all of them , but that she would be hack very , very soon . " How long ? " Daisy asked fearfully . " Only six weeks , " Francesca answered and Daisy burst into tears .  | " Daisy , " Francesca reproached her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't very long and I 'll come home as soon as they 're over . Just six Sundays and six Mondays . . . it 's not so much . " " And six Tuesdays and six Wednesdays , " Daisy said sadly . " Would you make a lot of money , Mama ? " " Yes , darling . " " And then you 'd come right home ? " " Yes , darling , the minute the work is finished . " " All right , Mama , I understand , " Daisy said reluctantly . Later , Daisy and Dani exchanged a long stream of sibilant babble , with Daisy saying almost everything and Dani asking what obviously were questions . At the end of the conversation Dani , who could walk perfectly well by now , went down on all fours , like a baby , crawled into a corner of the room , pulled up a rag rug , and lay under it , her silent , wretched little face turned toward the wall . " Daisy ? What did you say ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you explained to me , Mama . She did n't understand . I could n't make her understand . I tried and tried , really I tried . She does n't know what coming back means  --  she does n't understand about earning money . " " Try again ! " " I tried . . . now she wo n't listen to me . Oh , Mama , I tried so hard . " " All right . . . it 's all right , Daisy darling . I do n't really have to go away . It was just an idea . Would you tell Dani that I 'm not leaving , that I 'm not going anywhere ? " Daisy put her arms around her mother 's neck and pressed her warm , soft face into Francesca 's cheek . " Do n't be sad , Mama . Please do n't be sad . I 'll help you work . I 'll help you make some money . I promise I will . " Francesca looked at the courageous little figure with the eyes like flowers , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her waist , her tan knees scratched from adventurous rambles in the deep forest , her hands beginning to lose their baby fat , to become capable , caring and strong . " I know you will . " She smiled without a trace of sadness . " We 'll figure out something . . . something fun . " " Ca n't we ask Daddy ? " " No ! Daisy , that 's the one thing we can never , never do . " " Why not ? "  | " I 'll explain  --  when you 're older . " " Oh , " said Daisy , with an air of resignation . " That 's one more thing I have to remember , for you to explain when I 'm older . " " Do I say that a lot ? " " Yes , Mama . But it 's all right . Do n't be sad again . " Suddenly Daisy changed the subject . " Mama , am I really and truly a princess ? Daddy said I was . " " Yes , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course she is  --  how could you be a princess if Dani were n't a princess too ? " " But you , Mama , are you a queen ? " " No , Daisy , I 'm not a queen . " " But in stories the mother of a princess is always queen , " she said stubbornly . " Once  --  I was a princess , too , Daisy , " Francesca murmured . " Once ' .... Are n't you a princess anymore ? " " Daisy , Daisy , it 's too complicated for you to understand right now . And anyway , it 's just a word , it does n't mean anything really , nothing important , nothing for you to bother about . We do n't live in a world of princesses here  --  just the two of us and Masha and Dani and the deer and the birds ? Is n't that good enough for you , my Daisy ? " Something about Francesca 's face told Daisy to agree with her mother . But it was n't good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no one seemed to ever give her an answer to her most important questions , particularly the ones she had never dared to bring up : why did her father only come to see her at long intervals ? Why did he never see Dani ? And most important of all , what had she , Daisy , done wrong to make him go away each time after only a few days . It was never discussed , never even hinted at , and somehow she understood that she must never ask , never . " Masha , look , I 've shelled all the peas , " " How many did you eat , little one ? " " Only six . Eight . Maybe ten . " " I know , they are better raw . I always thought so , too . " " Oh , Masha , you know everything ! " " Ah , will you tell me that in ten years ? " " Masha , Masha . . . why is Dani different from me ? " " What . . . what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin sister . That means we were born at the same time . Mama told me that . That 's what twins are , two babies in the same mother . But Dani does n't talk like me and she ca n't really run like me  --  not as fast  --  and she ca n't climb trees and she 's afraid of thunder and rain and birds and she does n't draw pictures like me or cut her own meat , and she ca n't count like me , or tie her own shoes . Why , Masha ? " " Oh , Daisy , I do n't know . " " Yes , you do , Masha , you know . Mama wo n't tell me but you will . You always tell me everything . " " Daisy , you were born first , that 's all I know . " " Born first ? " Daisy was astonished . " Twins are born together , that 's what makes them twins . You 're silly , Masha . " " No , Daisy , one twin is born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , the way your Mama told you , but one has to come out of the mother first and then the other . You were born first . " " So it is my fault . " She spoke slowly , as if something she had long suspected had , at last , been confirmed by adult authority . " Do n't be silly , little one , it 's God 's will , not anybody 's fault . You should know better than to talk like that ! Daisy ? " " Yes , Masha ? " " You understand , do n't you ? " " I understand , Masha . " Yes , she understood . She had been born first so it was her fault . Masha always talked about God 's will , but Daisy knew that when Masha said that it meant that Masha did n't understand either . As 1957 wore on , the winter storms brought driftwood to the hidden beaches of Big Sur , wild , windswept beaches where sandpipers jittered and great waves carved strange bridges out of giant rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrating whales could be sometimes seen in their benign , silent flotillas . Francesca had found a craftsman in Carmel who made lamps out of driftwood and she made a little money collecting it from the beaches , polishing the best pieces and bringing them in to him from time to time . She usually went alone to the beach , but one early spring day in 1958 , she took Daisy and Dani with her . She left Dani in Daisy 's charge and wandered along the beach , one piece of driftwood luring her to another , until she suddenly realized that the children were out of sight . " Dear God ! " She ran back the way she 'd come and stopped  | suddenly . Daisy was sitting on the warm sand out of range of even the farthest lapping wave . She held Dani in her little lap , awkwardly since they were almost the same size . Their sixth birthday was only a week away . Daisy was rocking Dani back and forth and from the shape of her mouth , Francesca could see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Daisy patted her hand over Dani 's hair and kissed her cheek , with a maternal gesture . Dani 's beautiful face wore its usual sweet , contented expression . A great inner peace descended on Francesca , a feeling of joy so simple and so deep that she almost fell on her knees . She had been right . She had done the only possible thing . She had been blessed . One week later Stash received a long-distance call from Matty Firestone in California . The agent was sobbing unashamedly . " You get here as quickly as you can . Francesca 's gone ... she 's dead . She was driving back from Carmel , on the ocean side , Route One , I always warned her  --  some madman in a pickup truck swung wide , she went off the road . . . into the sea . " " Daisy ! " Stash screamed . " Francesca was alone . I went up and brought Masha and the kids back . They 're here at our house . Come and get them , Valensky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God help them . "  | On a spring Sunday in London in 1963 , Stash Valensky and Daisy , who was now eleven , entered the Connaught Hotel for their regular Sunday lunch alone together . Lunch at the Connaught is one of the premiere experiences of Western civilization , the Uffizi Gallery of dining , and Stash , still absorbed in taming his invincible child , thought that the Connaught , with its richly subdued air of comfy pomp , its air of being not a hotel but a lordly private house , in which one always feels the subliminal ticking of a soberly friendly Victorian grandfather clock , provided the best atmosphere for his purpose . The doorman greeted them as old friends ; they walked through the small , deeply carpeted , russet-toned lobby dominated by a sweeping , prodigiously polished flight of mahogany stairs , and turned right to pass through the corridor which led to the restaurant , recognized as one of three finest in England . As usual , Stash had to keep a firm hand on Daisy 's elbow , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platters laden with a dozen different kind of cold hors d'oeuvres , melons , salads , lobsters , stuffed crab and a selection of game pies . The tables laden with food were crowded in that wide corridor , which also held a little mirrored bar and tall vases of spring flowers , in a way that suggested an overflowing abundance that caused Daisy to linger inquiringly over each dish , trying to decide , even before she read the menu , what looked most interesting today . The restaurant had walls of highly waxed , dark honey-colored wood , on which glowed crystal sconces with apricot shades . The chairs and banquettes were covered with burgundy-striped velvet and large screens broke the restaurant up into sections , at the same time imparting an Alice in Wonderland feeling to the substantial room since the bases of the screens were carved wood to the height of a seated diner , but above they were made of engraved glass , so that standing up , one could see through them . Stash and Daisy 's favorite table was in the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it provided a vantage point from which they could see all their fellow gourmets and speculate on them . Many people looked up from their plates as they entered . Stash had changed almost not at all . At fifty-two , his hair was as blond , as thick and as close cropped as ever ; his features as strongly marked with an air of valor and resolution . Alone , he would have attracted attention , but with Daisy he aroused the most lively inspection , even in this sanctuary of solid , upper-class lack of curiosity , for she was a child out of fairyland . Daisy was five feet tall now and possessed the slim roundness of prepuberty which is so tender , so free of the slightest fault , so pristine and yet so full of rushing life , that it causes the most hardened adults to give a sigh for a vanquished vulnerability and strength they must have once possessed . She wore an ivory dress of the thinnest wool challis printed with clusters of pale pink flowers and pale green leaves . It was pleated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back , and the collar was like a little garland around her neck , where the flowers of the dress had been cut out and thickly appliqued . Her gilt-blonde hair almost reached her waist and it was brushed back and held by a simple band , but nothing could restrain the individual curls that sprang from her forehead and escaped above her ears . The light coming from the great Victorian windows of Carlos Place seemed to attack Daisy 's hair , snatching and catching it with a rollicking freedom , all the planes and shafts of the watery spring sun finding an object worthy of their focus . It was the hair of an oldfashioned heroine , tresses that looked as if they had been lovingly brushed by a mother and admired and envied by aunts and sisters ; hair precious enough to be kept in lockets and treasured for decades . Stash guided her to their table with an air of possession that he could n't conceal . He cherished Daisy in a way that deeply frightened him . He had long ago learned that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being , but he was helpless in the face of the mere existence of this daughter of his , this treasure he had almost lost , this obstinate , bold-hearted , loving female creature he had worshiped from the first , never-to-beforgotten sight of her , as he had never worshiped another female in all his life . Now , in Daisy , he saw himself as a young boy , the forever lost , forever innocent , forever hopeful self which can only be recaptured in a dream , the forgotten self that vanishes as one wakes , leaving only a  | feeling of impossible brightness and unreasoning happiness , a feeling that rarely lingers for more than a few seconds . As the tail-coated waiter handed Daisy the white menu bordered in brown and gold , with the date printed at the bottom , she gave a sign of anticipation , although she knew it nearly by heart now , after almost three years of such lunches . She had long since passed the stage of chicken pie , of lamb chops , even of roast sirloin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first settled . Stash had , in the beginning , tried to lead her carefully through the menu , but he quickly found out that there was no way he could convince or cajole her into ordering something new . She had no interest in " training her taste buds , " she said to him , repeating his pedantic phrase with a teasing look . He often wondered where his nimble girl , who never faltered in her attempts to make her own decisions , had learned to be so adamant in those backwoods in which she had spent those early years of her life . But even when she was first confronted by the grandeur of the service of the Connaught , Daisy 's smile informed the maitre d'hotel that she represented no one on earth but herself and that since she had wanted chicken pie every Sunday for a year , that was what she would order . " Well , Princess Daisy , " the maitre d'hotel greeted her with relish , " what is your choice today ? " " What , " she asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs ? " " Tiny quail eggs , served with creamed mushrooms and hollandaise on little pastry barquettes . " " Daisy , you had eggs for breakfast . Why do n't you start with some smoked Scotch salmon ? " Stash asked . " That 's listed under the extras , ' Father , " Daisy rebuked him gravely . Stash sighed inwardly . No matter how often he explained to her that she was permitted to order from the extras , she never would . Her habits of thrift , learned so young , could n't be forgotten even in this restaurant in which the final bill would represent such an astonishing total that one or two extra dishes would n't be noticed . She went to the Connaught because he took her there , but nothing he could say had ever convinced her to order an extra , not even the Salade Caprice des Annees Folles , surely the most delightfully named dish in the world . " If I might suggest , " said the maitre d'hotel , " the trolley of hors  | d'oeuvres so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobster grilled with herbs  --  we have just received a superb shipment from France ? " " Are they still alive ? " asked Daisy . " But of course ! They must be alive before we cook them . " " I 'll have a Lancashire hot pot then , " announced Daisy , not knowing what on earth it was but determined not to directly cause the immediate death of a single lobster . Ah , thought the headwaiter , Prince Valensky must take care . If the little girl should become , disaster of disasters , a vegetarian , we might not see her every Sunday . Lunch finally ordered , Daisy and Stash settled into the easy conversations he enjoyed now more than any other single thing in his life . He was teaching her his world , little by little , and she , in turn , brought him all the excitements of her life at school and acquainted him with the small adventures of her friends . But today she had something special on her mind . " Father , in your opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Naturally  --  they teach it in school , do n't they ? " " Yes , but I hate it and I ca n't study my maths and do a proper job on my new pony . How can I ride Merlin every afternoon after school and then muck out her stall and turn over her bedding , groom her with the curry comb and vacuum her all over and use the body brush and the rub rag and the hoof pick and ... " " All that takes exactly one half-hour and you know it , " Stash said , laughing at the dramatically detailed list she 'd presented him in the hope that he 'd be impressed . " You still have time for maths . " Daisy , a seasoned strategist , abandoned Merlin instantly . " Anabel says she does n't see why I have to do maths  --  she never did and she says she never missed it . Anabel says she 's never balanced a checkbook in her life and the only reason for maths is to balance checkbooks or find out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is , you wo n't get the best fish so you might as well resign yourself . " " So Anabel has become your authority on education ? " " Anabel is my authority on many things , " said Daisy with dignity . " However , if you gave me three good reasons why I have to do maths , I 'd try , even though I think there 's something missing in the place in my brain where most people have maths . " " I 'll give you only one good reason because I do n't need  | another  --  Lady Alden requires that all girls at her school do maths . " " I think it 's most unreasonable of Lady Alden . . . most unreasonable , " Daisy grumbled . " Did Anabel teach you to say things are unreasonable ? " " No , you did . You said it was most unreasonable of me to want to jump Merlin over the railings in Wilton Crescent . " Daisy 's face crinkled in mischief . She changed her moods so rapidly that Stash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grown woman , a scruffy farmboy or a sage member of Parliament . " I 'm afraid you 're a pagan , Daisy . " " I would n't mind . Do n't they dance around trees and do strange things when the moon is full ? " " I believe those were Druids . Pagans are like the ancient Greeks or Romans , people who worshiped many gods , not just one . " " Oh , good , I think I 'd like to be one . Like you are , Father . " Heading her off this unpromising subject Stash asked quickly , " How 's Merlin getting used to the stable ? " Merlin , the latest in a series of ponies , each taller than the last , was named after Stash 's old favorite , now retired from the fray . Daisy 's horse was stabled in Grosvenor Crescent Mews , a few minutes away from Wilton Row , where the Valensky house was located . The stable had been run by Mrs. Leila Blum for twenty years . It was dark , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose-boxes rather than a less spacious stall where she would have to be tied up . " She 's as happy as the day is long , " Daisy said importantly . " There 're a few black cats hanging about and she gets along very well with them , but Merlin really and truly wants a dog . She craves a dog , passionately . " " She does , does she ? Did she say what kind of dog ? " " Just a dog ? " " She craves ' it passionately ? " " Absolutely . " " Something tells me that Merlin 's been talking to Anabel . " " No , Father , she communicates with me . You know horses can , if they like . " " Hmmm . Daisy , is n't it time for a sweet ? " Daisy inspected her father 's face closely . For three years she had been trying to get him to buy her a dog . He was n't a man who loved dogs , he was n't a man who even liked dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light in his eyes , she realized it was hopeless to pursue the subject .  | " I 'd love a sweet , " Daisy said . The matter was not yet settled , but it was only a question of time . She had no intention of giving up . Stash signaled the waiter who wheeled over one of the dessert trolleys , shining objects of solid mahogany on four silent ball bearings , with several levels of trays , each covered in an array of desserts : chocolate , lemon and raspberry mousse , bread-and-butter pudding , rice pudding , apple tarts , assorted pastries , poached fruit in port , fresh fruit salad served with thick cream from Normandy , large , rich cakes and mille feuilles aux fraises . The doting waiter , worthy inheritor of the Connaught tradition , never waited for Daisy to make the agonizing choice but simply filled a plate with small samples of every dessert on the trolley , except for the rice pudding . After dessert , while Stash had his coffee , the waiter , as he did at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of miniature sweets : fresh strawberries dipped in chocolate , tiny eclairs and cherries iced in frosting . Each one of them lay in a fluted paper cup . While Stash stared fixedly at the floor , Daisy deftly swept every single one of these delicacies into her small handbag , which she had lined with her best handkerchiefs in anticipation of this loot . The first time she had done it Stash had been horrified . " Daisy ! A lady can eat as many of those as she likes at the table , but she does n't take them away with her ! " " They 're not for me . " " Oh . " Stash knew immediately for whom they were intended . She was taking them to the other . He never mentioned them again but endured in silence the humiliation of the weekly incident . Daisy would not have allowed him to order a box of the candied treats for her , he knew , because then they would be " extra " and he could n't bring himself to deprive her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Stash had received the telephoned news of Francesca 's death from Matty Firestone , he had started to consider his options even as he booked the flight to Los Angeles . Almost immediately he realized that someone had to be told the story which had been , until now , kept absolutely secret from all the world . He needed help in managing the future and Anabel was the only person he trusted . During the few days that Stash was away in California , Anabel managed to find Queen Anne 's School , the best home for retarded children in England , and make arrangements for Danielle to live there .  | She drove Stash 's big car to the airport to meet the little band since he had been adamant about the need to keep the arrival of the children hidden , even from his chauffeur . As they came through customs she saw Stash , walking ahead , with Daisy 's hand in his . The little girl was as confused by the rapidly changing events of the last week as she was grief-stricken . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother had driven off one afternoon and had not come home . How could she be dead ? Neither Matty nor Margo nor Stash himself had yet been able to bring themselves to explain the details of the accident to her , and Daisy was engulfed in the reality of her childish fears of abandonment . Behind Stash walked Masha , carrying Danielle who had retreated into a world of silence and immobility . Quickly , without asking questions , Anabel drove them to the school which was located in the country outside of London . When they arrived at the large building which had once been the main house of a great private estate , and was still surrounded by wide lawns , fine old trees and flower gardens , Stash told Masha , Daisy and Anabel to wait in the car for him . He picked Danielle up , the first and last time he ever touched her , and stepped out of the car , putting Danielle 's feet firmly on the driveway . Daisy jumped out and followed him , hanging on to his leg as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Daddy , where are we going ? Is this where you live ? Why is n't Masha coming , too ? " Stash kept climbing the wide steps . " Daisy darling , your sister 's going to live here for a while . It 's a wonderful place , a school for her . You 're coming to live with me in my house in London . " " NO ! " He stopped , bent down and spoke earnestly to the disbelieving and defiant child . " Now , listen to me , Daisy , this is very important . All the things you know how to do that she ca n't  --  like telling time and reading the cards I send you and jumping rope ? Well , if she lives ' , at this school for a while she 'll learn how to do all those things from the best teachers in the world and then you 'll be able to play together the way you 've always wanted to ... " " I love to play with her exactly the way she is oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she 'll miss me so much . I 'll miss her  --  please , please , Daddy ! " As she began to understand the implacable extent of his intentions , Daisy 's defiance turned to terrible fear .  | " Daisy , I understand that it 's hard , but you 're thinking only of yourself . Danielle will get to like it here very quickly and there are many other children for her to play with . But if she does n't live in a special place like this , she wo n't learn . Now , you do n't want that to happen to her , do you . . . you do n't want to keep her from learning all the grown-up things that you can do ? It would n't be fair , you know that . Now , would that be fair , Daisy ? " " No , " she sobbed , tears running down her face , down her neck and disappearing down the front of her dress . " Come along and you can see her lovely room and meet some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying ... I 'll make her cry , too . " " You have to stop . I want you to tell her all the things I said . You 've always said that she understands you , best . " " She wo n't understand now , Daddy . " " Go ahead and try . " Finally Daisy controlled herself enough to communicate with her sister in their private language . After only a short while Danielle was weeping huge tears and howling like a small animal . " She said : Day , no go ! ' " But did n't you tell her about all the things she 'd learn ? " Stash said impatiently . " She did n't know what I meant . " " Well , that just shows I 'm right . If she learns the things they can teach her here , she will understand . Now come on , Daisy , get her to stop that terrible noise she 's making and we 'll both take her to her nice room and she 'll be fine , just fine , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution were accustomed to , as they put it , " unfortunate scenes " when a child was finally left in their excellent care , but nothing had prepared them for the parting of Daisy and Danielle . All of them who were unlucky enough to be present found themselves in despair and some of them were reduced to unprofessional tears by the time Stash finally pried Daisy away , as gently as he could , although he eventually had to use brute force . After Daisy , shrieking and struggling and kicking , had been bodily carried down the corridor from Dani 's room and bundled into the car , Stash determined that such emotional traumas could only be had for her . The following Sunday , when he had promised Daisy that she could visit her sister , he refused to take her , carefully explaining  | page deleted  | page deleted  | but Daisy was aware of the limits of her powers . She could tease Stash about some things , she could act the playful tyrant , but only within certain well-defined borders . Motherless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he felt about her sister without discussion , or be totally orphaned . The compromise they had reached in that first week , that enabled Daisy to visit Danielle , slowly became more and more acceptable to her as her sister 's pliable nature adjusted happily to the teachers and the other children at Queen Anne 's School . Daisy could n't help but realize that she could n't go to Dani 's school and Dani certainly could n't go to Lady Alden 's . The five years of seclusion in Big Sur grew ever more remote and far away as her new life in London unfolded itself , a life she found constantly less possible to even attempt to explain to Dani . Their conversations were limited to Dani 's small circle of comprehension and , every year , Daisy felt more like an adult talking to a child , than one child talking to another . Daisy often drew pictures for Dani , until the walls of her room were almost papered with them . " Do pony " was one of Dani 's constant requests , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Anne 's School . At a time when Daisy 's peers at Lady Alden 's were struggling to draw presentable apples and bananas , Daisy was already able to do a lively sketch of one of the most difficult of all objects to draw well , a horse . When Daisy had first appeared in London , Ram had been a precociously alert thirteen . He had always rejected the existence of this half-sister , a product of a marriage made after his own birth . He did not accept the fact that this usurper had any rights . She was nonvalid . Worse , far worse , she was a rival . Ram was preoccupied , even more than most of his friends , all upper-class , public-school boys , by the importance of being an " heir . " At Eton , enormously important distinctions concerning inheritance had been made since the school was founded by Henry VI in 1442 . In 1750 the lists of pupils at Eton still appeared in order of rank , with duke 's sons coming first . Titled boys wore special clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the supposedly democratic 1950s and 1960s , certain of these out-of-date marks of a rigid caste system had been abolished , but the orderly passage of property and titles from one generation to another was deeply ingrained in the collective unconsciousness of Eton and the other  | great schools of Britain . They were as much in the air as the importance of cricket or the bad form of " showing off . " Ram could n't remember a time when he had n't looked forward to inheriting Stash 's property , all of it . He did n't consciously wish his father dead , he did n't even consciously realize that only his father 's death could make that property his , he simply lusted after it without any of the complications of guilt . He believed , in his heart of hearts , that the acid feelings of injustice from which he suffered  --  and which he never recognized were envy of happiness  --  would disappear when he was the possessor , the undisputed owner , the Prince Valensky . The fact of Daisy meant that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times he reassured himself that even if she got something , there was more than enough for both of them , still she had destroyed the splendid fullness of his prospects . However , he was too crafty and too wise to ever allow any of these feelings to surface and reveal themselves to grown-up eyes . As for Daisy , from the first moment she saw Ram , he filled a great place in her imagination . He was like the young heroes in the tales that her mother used to read to her , someone who could leap across dangerous rivers and tame the wildest horses , climb up sheer mountains of glass , ride on the wind and battle with giants . To the little girl who had lived for as long as she could remember in the solitude of far-off Big Sur , this straight , tall , darkly handsome boy with his slim , stern face , his dark eyebrows and haughty Etonian air , was the most fascinating person in her new life , particularly since he had an offhand manner with her which lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have imagined the worm of obsessive envy that ate at Ram . At Christmas , while they were each opening their presents , he watched , behind lowered eyes , and saw that although hOth he and Daisy received equally expensive presents , Stash 's eyes were only on Daisy as she opened the gifts , waiting to drink in her pleasure . Immediately Ram 's own presents lost all meaning for him . When he received Daisy 's letters at Eton , and she innocently wrote describing a Sunday Connaught lunch , Ram thought bitterly that the only times Stash had taken him to the Connaught had been on his birthday or to celebrate a school holiday . Twice , at Christmas , his mother insisted that he come home to that cold , drafty castle near Edinburgh instead of staying with his father , and those were the two times that Stash chose to take Daisy away to Barbados for a month of  | sun . . . a deliberate choice , without doubt , Ram told himself , feeling the pain of being left out bum deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daisy grew older , every time he went to London he hoped to find that she had finally broken out in adolescent pimples or started to get fat . He received the admiring looks she gave him without any flattery and when she asked him questions about his life at school , he answered as briefly as possible . He watched , missing nothing , as she stole all the attention that should have been his , took the place by his father 's side that was Ram 's by right . And all the while , Daisy , who never had any idea of how he felt , was impelled by his manner to continue to try to form a connection with him , inspired by a deeply feminine impulse that was so strong it positively tugged at its moorings in search of his love . She drew his face so often that Dani began to say , " Do Ram " although she had n't the glimmer of an idea who Ram might be . Stash had bought a house that was not typical of London houses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are the cause of the remarkable architectural unity of London 's squares and crescents . He had discovered a house in Wilton Row , a small cul-de-sac off Wilton Crescent , a street within a short distance of Hyde Park on the left and the gardens of Buckingham Palace on the right , that , nevertheless , had a quality of remoteness , an almost secret existence . In that sedate , supremely aristocratic part of London , with its concentration of imposing foreign embassies , Stash had managed to find an exceptionally large house , low and rather wide , painted a pale yellow with gray shutters . It had a distinctly foreign look about it , this house that might have fit easily into many parts of the European countryside . The three sides of Wilton Row surrounded a cobbled space with a pale blue lamppost at its center , where no cars were allowed to park unless they belonged to the other homeowners , all of whom had painted their houses in pastel , altogether un-British colors . There were bow windows on the ground floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions . He had filled them with the contents of the Lausanne villa ; those rare and valuable French rugs , furniture , paintings and jeweled bibelots which had once made the journey from St. Petersburg to Davos with his parents . It never occurred to Stash to decorate his home in any way but the one he had been used to as a child .  | The noise of London was extinguished in Wilton Row , and an air of rustic peace prevailed . At the corner , where Wilton Row joined a tiny alley called Old Barrack Yard , stood a pub , the Grenadier , bravely painted in red and gold , with benches in front , sheltered by a twisted , venerable wisteria vine . A sign announced that only customers who had entered Wilton Row by taxi or on foot were allowed to be served . All in all , there was scarcely a more private dwelling place in all that great , gray city than the Valensky home . For many years Stash and Daisy spent a large part of Saturday in Kent , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses . It was after one of their companionable rides through the country , on a day when Daisy was almost twelve , that father and daughter spied two gypsy caravans . They were parked close to Stash 's property and , mistrustfully , he eyed the wagons with their painted canvas tops stretched over hooped ribs . They had n't been there last week . Stash went over to investigate . " Daisy , " he ordered , " you go back to the stable . I 'll just be a minute . " " Oh , Father , you would n't deprive me of seeing gypsies ? ! " she cried in dismay . " They 're just tinkers , Daisy , but I do n't want them around my ponies . They can always use an extra horse or two or five . " " Please , Father , " she said longingly . " All right , " he sighed , not in the mood for discipline . " Just do n't let anyone tell your fortune  --  I detest that . " The gypsies were friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his questions in their accented English . They would move on if he liked but they were only planning to stay another day or two anyway . Just the time to do a bit of tinkering in the local village . Not really reassured , but not able to order them off a field he did n't own , Stash turned to leave , but Daisy was no longer at his side . She was on her knees in front of a box crooning a love song and both hands were full of a puppy which looked to Stash like a beanbag . The puppy 's bottom and hind legs drooped down from one of Daisy 's hands , his head and front legs flopped from the other . In the center of Daisy 's palms he rested his bulging belly . The puppy 's color was at one and the same time gray , brown and blue , with white paws and white ears . He looked as if he could be any kind of dog at all except some recognizable breed .  | Damn and bloody blast , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a sporting man , not for him the joys of the turf or the pleasures of the hunt , both of which seemed so inferior compared to polo . He had n't the faintest interest in animals other than horses and he had no knowledge of the part that hunting game on foot plays II , in the lives of many country people . " She 's a good lurcher , " said the gypsy . " And for sale . " Had Stash any knowledge of dogs or the hunt this statement would have caused him to take Daisy by the arm and leave on the instant . No gypsy can sell you a " good " lurcher puppy . It is a definition without meaning since no lurcher can be called " good " until it is old enough to hunt , for that is a lurcher 's role in life . It is a poacher 's dog , a gypsy 's dog , a tramp 's dog , silent , swift , deadly . A good lurcher can catch a low-flying seagull in one jump ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightly raids on the countryside , can leap high barbed-wire fences , gallop miles over frozen ground and kill a deer by itself . " Looks like a mutt to me , " said Stash . " No , a lurcher . Dam 's half Irish wolfhound crossed with greyhound , and his dad 's a cross of deerhound and greyhound with whippet and sheepdog both in there one generation back . Ca n't ask finer than that . " " That 's just a mongrel . " " No , sir , lurcher . You wo n't find them in dog shows , but you ca n't ask for a better dog . " " If he 's such a prize , why are you selling him ? " " Got eight in the litter . Ca n't take them all traveling , now , can we ? Still , a bargain for the man who buys him . " The gypsy knew that the puppy Daisy was holding with such adoration had one hind leg shorter than the other . Such a lurcher probably could n't outrun a j @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had planned on abandoning him when he moved on , but the puppy 's ancestry was exactly as he had reported it and had it not been for that short leg , he would n't have sold him for a hundred pounds . " Come on , Daisy , let 's get back . " Daisy did n't have to say anything . The appeal in her eyes was enough to make Stash suspect that he had postponed the dog question too long . " All right , " he said hastily , " I promise I 'll get you a dog . Next weekend , Daisy . We 'll go visit some good kennels and you can pick  | any dog you want . That 's a mutt , some kind of hound and God knows what else . You do n't want him . You want a purebred puppy . " " I want Theseus . " " Theseus ? " " Father , you know , the boy who went to fight the minotaur in the labyrinth  --  we 're doing the Greek myths this term with Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew the minute I saw him . " " Funny name for a lurcher , " said the gypsy . " Never mind about that , " snapped Stash . " How much are you asking for him ? " " Twenty pounds . " " I 'll give you five . " " I 'll give you the other fifteen . I 've got it from my Christmas money , Father . " Daisy rushed into the bargaining , shocking both men who had been ready to settle for ten pounds right from the beginning . And so Theseus the lurcher , for whom Stash eventually had to give twelve pounds , came to live in London , where Daisy now added the duties of feeding him and training him and exercising him to her other activities , managing somehow to get over the first few difficult weeks when Theseus often collapsed on the floor from the weight of his full stomach and was n't able to get up without assistance . However , with enough minced beef and raw eggs and milk and honey he soon grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he slipped like a shadow into the big kitchen larder and without a sound which might have betrayed him , snatched clean a platter of stuffed , boneless chicken breasts , leaving a raging cook with suspicions but no proof . He soon accommodated himself to his shorter rear leg which only showed up in a rolling gait , like that of a hard-drinking man who 's had three martinis but is still good for a few more . He slept in a basket next to Daisy 's bed , often on his back with all four legs up in the air , and quickly was on the most intimate and friendly terms with Daisy 's pony , sniffing Merlin 's nose like an ardent lover and curling up at her hooves . However , he divided the Valensky 's servants into two camps : those who wooed and spoiled him , victims of his con-man tactics of wild affection combined with a certain morose look of incredible pathos he knew how to give them that melted their hearts , and those who detested him on the solid grounds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beef nor their blinis , nor their rashers of bacon , nor their piroshki nor their fondue , and certainly not their mugs of stout . Stash 's Russian servants were now all in their seventies , many of them had died and others retired , but those who remained , those who had left Russia as very young people in 1912 , now enjoyed a diet that combined English , Swiss and Russian culinary delights . Age had only improved their hearty appetites . Theseus seemed to eat his weight every day , and in a short time the floppy puppy became a lean dog , the size of a large , strong greyhound , two and a half feet tall at the shoulder . Short of locking and barring the doors to the kitchen and larder , it was impossible to keep out the crouching , sidling , slinking , all-but-invisible animal who pounced silently , consumed his prey in a gulp , and disappeared before the theft could be discovered . He was merely performing his function in life , but few of them were sympathetic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bred into him throughout centuries . Yet lurchers , for all their stealthy ways , are noble dogs . Many hundreds of years ago the ownership of these rough-coated , mixedblood greyhounds was confined to princes . They wore collars of gold , they were indispensable at court , where hunting was the principal pastime , and many an antique tapestry is adorned by their royal presence . Daisy 's school , Lady Alden 's , was the most fashionable in all of London . It operated on two principles which , extraordinarily enough , turned out well-educated young women . The teachers all were required to come from aristocratic backgrounds ; Lady Alden had a decided preference for the daughters of impoverished earls  --  Lady Janes and Lady Marys abounded . The girls , from six to sixteen , did not need to fill such requirements . All they needed was parental money , preferably on a monarchical scale . That many of the parents were also wellborn was merely a happy coincidence . During all the nine years that she was a pupil at Lady Alden 's , Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harrods , but always exactly the same design : navy blue sailor dresses with white collars and piping , covered by pale blue pinafores that buttoned down the back . She arrived every day before nine o'clock at the entrance to the school 's three adjoining buildings on a quiet street not far from  | Kensington Gardens and the Albert Memorial . After prayers Daisy and all the other students , some hundred girls in all , filed out past Lady Alden , dropping her a curtsy and saying good morning in a voice which had to be clear , audible and well-articulated . Lady Alden , a former beauty , was a firm disciplinarian , and when her attention turned toward any individual girl a heart palpitated instantly . She wielded a formidable ruler which she never hesitated to use on the knuckles of her pupils , and even the titled teachers quailed before her . When Daisy left for school one fall day , shortly after Theseus had come to live in her room , the cook and the ancient butler carried out a plot to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door by holding a chicken high in the air . She flung the chicken outside , onto the cobbles , and when Theseus flashed through the open door she closed it behind him and locked it . The two conspirators waited for sounds of the dog 's paws on the front door , determined to ignore him until he wandered away . Theseus merely engulfed the chicken , briskly shook his coat of longish hair that was rough to the touch , perked up his white ears , and followed Daisy to Lady Alden 's by smell . When she emerged that afternoon she found him there , patiently curled up outside the entrance to the guard box from which Sam , the porter , protected the school and its precious young ladies from contact with the world . " So that 's your dog , Miss , " said Sam , who called all the students Miss because he could n't be bothered to remember the great variety of titles they bore . " Well , he ca n't stay here every day , if that 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a proper fit if she knew . " Theseus , in a delirium of delight , was hurling himself at Daisy , putting his front paws on her shoulders and passionately nuzzling her face , all in proper lurcher silence . " No , Sam , of course not , " said Daisy thoughtfully . Had a dog ever gone to Lady Alden 's school before ? No one knew . Such a violation was beyond the realm of imagination , rather like the possibility of the art students having a naked man to pose for them , or for that matter , a naked woman . But go to school Theseus did for three years ; smuggled in through a tiny door at the back of the shed that was reserved for the gardener . Tactfully , he slept all day on a bed of cushions Daisy brought , one at a time , from her own room , so totally hidden in one dark corner that he went unnoticed except for the cooperative gardener who loathed Lady Alden as much as he loved dogs and never asked any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch in a buttoned pocket , having had much experience with lurchers before he came to the City . Daisy was fifteen . It was April of 1967 and London was at its peak , the center of all that was new and vital . Daisy was equally in love with all the Beatles , Vidal Sassoon , Rudolf Nureyev , Twiggy , Mary Quant , Jean Shrimpton and Harold Pinter . She was not in love with Andy Warhol or Baby Jane Holzer or even Mick Jagger . Yet in a year in which any shopgirl could choose between dressing like an American Indian in leather and beads and headbands , or like a romantic trollop in Viva Maria-inspired lacy , tucked bloomers and frilly blouses , in a year in which the mini-skirt became a micro-skirt and eventually turned into shorts , she was still confined to a navy sailor dress and a pinafore . " I 'd have to wear my school uniform all the time , if it were up to Father and Masha , " she exploded to Anabel after lunch in Eaton Square one Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Anabel 's gray green couches . " Hmmm . You do n't look so terribly underprivileged to me , " Anabel answered , surveying her from top to bottom . Daisy was wearing black velvet knee breeches and a matching jacket trimmed with gold buttons and black braid , over a ruffled blouse of white silk . She had on white ribbed tights and flat black slippers with a rosette on the front . Today she had dressed her incomparable hair in curly bangs and tied it back on each side of her face with bunches of shiny black ribbons . She had darkened her blonde eyebrows a little and wore a hint of mascara , but no other make-up . From the time Anabel had first seen Daisy , a six-year-old whose mother had just died , a six-year-old who was about to be separated from her twin sister , and who had come to live in a strange country with a father she knew only from fleeting visits , Anabel had been fascinated by the little girl 's indomitable sense of what was right . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty that had enabled her to force even Stash , that man of hard metal who , in Anabel 's opinion , had never quite gotten the hang of life , to give in to her insistence that she visit her sister every week . She had watched Daisy grow up with intense interest , missing nothing . Often Anabel wondered how Daisy managed to slip , seemingly without too much difficulty , into a life that must have been utterly foreign to her Anabel was too wise to think that she understood everything about Daisy  --  she was not a child who confided , who poured out her  | troubles . She was not a child without secrets . She must have paid a price . Would Daisy , Anabel wondered , burn out this early promise and become just another pretty teenager ? Now at fifteen , Daisy had not only retained the purity and fire she had always possessed but approaching adulthood could be clearly read on her face . There , thought Anabel , is a girl who is going to cause all kinds of perfectly wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse of curiosity which must beat in the hearts of the men who saw her . . . that full , enigmatic mouth , so ripe with promise and yet so innocent , and those eyes that , no matter how frank they were , contained unfathomable , never to be analyzed depths in their velvety blackness . . . and , oh , a body , a faultless body , strong and slim , and lucky child , she came naturally by the romantic and wild look which was the fashion of the day . Yet here Daisy was , suddenly painfully full of the pent-up turmoil and ferocious misery of adolescence , now focused on clothes , which had never meant anything to her before . Indignantly , Daisy continued , " You just do n't know how I had to fight like a mad thing to get Father to let me go shop at Annacatcan you imagine it , Anabel , Father wanted me to go to Harrods young ladies ' department and buy plaid skirts and twin sets . Twin sets ! " " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Anabel observed mildly . " Only in the country , only if they 're parson 's daughters , and then only with jeans , " Daisy said rebelliously . " He does n't realize I 've grown up . I 'm not allowed to go out with boys yet , not that I know any ! It 's just impossible ! " She was at the rebellious age , no doubt about it , Anabel thought . Trouble in sight for Stash with his old-fashioned ideas . At fifty-six he had become as conservative where Daisy was concerned as he was unconventional for himself . Not an uncommon fix for the fathers of beautiful daughters to find themselves in , she ruminated with a touch of inward glee . Why , when she was only a year older than Daisy was now she 'd run away and married that awful bore , what 's his name . He 'd died last year . . . yet if she 'd stayed married to him , she 'd be the Dowager Marchioness now . At the thought Anabel could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious as possible since she truly loved the girl and knew how adolescents hate it if they are n't treated with appropriate solemnity . Anabel had arranged their intimate lunch on purpose for just such conversation ,  | because she sensed the essential , the irremediable loneliness of the age Daisy was going through . Both the girl and the woman were surprised at the sound of the doorbell on the floor below . Anabel expected no visitors until Stash that evening . In a minute Ram entered the drawing room and Daisy rose to her feet in delight . Now that he had his own flat and was working in the City she rarely saw this twenty-two-year-old halfbrother . " What 's that God-awful fancy dress you 've got on ? " he asked . He looked annoyed . He 'd dropped by unannounced , hoping to find Anabel alone , so that they could have a chat , and here she was closeted with Daisy . He did n't even notice that Daisy 's expectant look of joy , her open smile at the sight of him , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrank with hurt at his careless words . " You do n't know one damn thing about fashion , Ram , " Anabel snapped in an irritated voice he 'd rarely heard her use . " Daisy looks divine , as any fool would know . " " Only if you say so , Anabel darling , " he said absently , ignoring Daisy . " I 've got to get home , " Daisy said hastily . She could n't wait to take off the velvet knee breeches and ruffled shirt she 'd been so proud of . Now this ravishing pageboy , this festival of a girl felt ashamed of the way she looked . Ram 's approval , which she had sought so fruitlessly for the last nine years , meant almost everything to her , no matter how often she told herself that for reasons she could n't understand he did n't like her and would never like her . He had the power to hurt her as no one else could . Ram , unattainable , detached , withdrawn , undemonstrative Ram , who showed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her helpless with love and passionate with the desire to please . At Lady Alden 's , where Daisy was in her next to last year , she was the acknowledged leader of her class , the champion jacks player of the school , one of the only girls who had never been reduced to tears by the application of Lady Alden 's ruler , and the center of a group of special friends who were as physically daring and as horsemad as she . They formed a potentially revolutionary society within the docile body of the school , which , had Lady Alden known of it , would have caused the dreaded ruler to fly as it had never flown before . Now Daisy , still smarting with the reception her first venture into grown-up clothes had drawn from Ram , contempiated taking out  | her feelings with a devilment which would exceed anything in the annals of the school . Her emotions were almost adult but she still only knew childish ways to relieve them . Even her best friends were aghast at her proposition . " A gymkhana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as I do a proper gymkhana 's got to be a field day , with horsemanship , exhibitions and all sorts of pageantry . Lady A would never hear of it . " " Lady A does n't own Belgrave Square . " " Oh , Daisy ! Oh , how perfectly awful ! Oh  --  could we really do it ? " " Why not ? If you 're all with me , that is . It 's merely a question of organization . " The Metropolitan Police were never able to explain the Great Belgrave Square Gymkhana to their superiors . How were they to know of the cunning resources of two dozen fiery young equestrians , who stole into that august park in the early morning hours and set up jumps and flags and brilliantly colored pennants and all matter of gates and fences ? By the light of dawn in their beige breeches and polished boots and stocks and tweed jackets , looking like all the other proper young ladies who ride in London , these she-devils quietly collected their horses from various stables all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square of turf and trees onto which face the embassies of Portugal , Mexico , Turkey , Norway , Germany , Austria and , appropriately enough , the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and the Imperial Defense College . One of the fearless number lived on the Square and had a key to the high iron entrance , and before the police had collected their wits not only had the Gymkhana started , but the entrances to all the main streets which led to the Square  --  Upper Belgrave Street , Belgrave Place , Wilton Terrace , Wilton Crescent and Grosvenor Crescent ? were blocked with cars , abandoned by their passengers who had flocked out to see what was going on . And what were a handful of policemen to do with a hoard of whooping , hurrahing wild teenagers , veterans of dozens of horse shows , as tough as cavalry and twice as tenacious , all mounted on swift horses , galloping madly about in the vernal sunshine as if a troop of Amazons had suddenly materialized from another time in history ? Led by Daisy , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence in a bacchanalian circle , holding their pennants high in the air and brandishing them at the London sky with no lack of pageantry . Yet there was discipline in their ranks and Daisy 's whistle could make them all slow to a canter  | or form into a double line at a trot . The police could no more have arrested them than if they 'd been a Guard 's Regiment , coming to Troop the Colors . Nor could they be caught . The Gymkhana ended only when the sound of police sirens started to get close to Belgrave Square . At that moment , Daisy raised her arm and shouted  --  and all her inspired band scattered , jumping their horses over the railings and fleeing into the friendly , cheering carnival crowds who had surrounded the square . It was perfectly true , as Daisy had said , that Lady Alden did n't own Belgrave Square . The Earl of Grosvenor did , just as he owned almost every square inch of Mayfair and Belgravia . The Grosvenor family is the wealthiest private landlord in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London representing only one of their holdings all over the world . The Earl of Grosvenor most certainly owned Wilton Row . . . Stash only leased his house from the Grosvenor Trust . In the offices of the trustees of the Grosvenor Trust there was little amusement concerning Daisy 's Gymkhana . The gardeners of Belgrave Square had reported that the turf was damaged to the tune of hundreds of pounds . However , that was n't their chief objection .. . it was the principle of the thing . A typical sign on a typical park in Grosvenor territory reads like the one which adorns the entrance to Wilton Crescent 's semi-oval green space . Some of the injunctions written thereon forbid any game involving noise , prohibit any children under the age of nine who are unaccompanied by adults and outlaw all dogs . Although tricycles and scooters may be used by accompanied children , they must be ridden only on the paths , no flower beds may be trodden upon or dug , and , in particular , organized groups of children can not be admitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quiet parks had been violated  --  shaken to its depths  --  by Daisy , who had been recognized and identified by one of the Grosvenor traffic wardens who had helplessly observed the Great Gymkhana . She was , he reported in an outraged voice , a young lady who owned ... a lurcher ! That news alone was enough to cause a hush and raise the eyebrows of the trustees , landowners all and therefore victims , down to their last remembered ancestor , of poachers and their dogs . A lurcher indeed ! Just what kind of young lady could possibly own a lurcher ? It was not , as one of the trustees soon explained to Stash , that they wished to punish his daughter , but if she was capable of such  | insurrection , what might she do next ? Stash thought about his lease , which had only three years to run before it would revert to the Grosvenor estate , and agreed with the trustee that certainly he would have to do something serious about the discipline of his daughter . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more daring than anything he remembered ever having done himself , at her age , even making allowances for the fact that she was a female . After the trustee had left , with a check for the damages and Stash 's assurances that the matter of Daisy would be attended to , he sat alone for a long time , thinking about his foolhardy daughter . How was she to grow up properly with , as adult examples , only himself and Anabel ? Neither of them was immoral , it was true , but they were certainly amoral , both of them heedless of the laws of ordinary society . Eton had turned Ram into a sober , unemotional , hardworking young man , but Lady Alden 's had missed having a salutory taming effect on Daisy . What would happen to Daisy when she no longer lived under his roof ? This matter of the Gymkhana went far beyond an irresponsible childish prank , Stash thought , feeling every one of his fifty-six years . He blamed himself . There was no doubt in his mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future ? He would not always be there to get her out of trouble . During the rest of April and May Stash considered the problem of Daisy as he attended to his affairs . Eventually , he sent for his solicitor and made certain thoughtful changes in his will , and then forgot about the matter , satisfied that he had acted prudently . A great deal of his fortune was now invested in Rolls-Royce and Stash watched with deep interest as the company attempted to break into the American-dominated manufacturing of airplane engines . In 1963 his faith in Rolls had been bolstered as their Spey turbofan engine was being widely bought and now in 1967 they were going after a contract with Lockheed to produce the engine for its TriStar Airbus , the RB. 211 . His investments had always been made on an emotional basis rather than on that of cold financial judgment , and Stash poured even more capital into the company he loved . However , the training of his stable of polo ponies occupied most of Stash 's time . He flew less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release from fury he had found in the air after Francesca had left him , fourteen years ago . All that seemed very far away and unimportant . Still he kept his jet license current and occasionally he flew aerobatic exhibitions in the many air shows which were so popular all over the  | country , returning for a few nostalgic hours to the cockpit of a lovingly preserved relic of a Spitfire or a Hurricane , with their RollsRoyce Merlin engines , still as trustworthy as ever . On a fine Sunday in May , there was no fault in the engine of the Spitfire he was flying at the Essex Air Show . The undercarriage of the twenty-seven-year-old plane stuck and the landing gear could not be released . Stash headed for the woods beyond the runway , hoping that the trees might cushion the crash . Many a fighter pilot had crashlanded in these planes and lived to tell the tale . He did not .  | In the weeks right after Stash 's death , Anabel , who grieved for Stash in her own way as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a premonition that Stash would be the last man in her life , pulled what was left of the family together . She insisted that Daisy and Ram spend the summer at the house near Honfleur that Stash had bought for her seven years before . Seeing Ram so unlike himself , functioning without his usual effectiveness , she persuaded him to take a leave of absence from his job in the City for all of June , July and August . However , with her great virtue of good sense , Anabel realized that three mourning people should never be alone together and she arranged for a constant stream of houseguests to come and stay in the large house ; friends from both her London life and her French summer world , people who would distract and beguile the sad household . Daisy , Anabel realized , was feeling the loss much more than Ram . It was she who was absolutely orphaned now  --  even Masha had died two years ago . When Daisy went to visit Dani for comfort , her twin , with uncanny intuition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hugged and petted her . Dani became so upset that she was reduced to silent tears . " Day , no do , " she said , drawing away , and finally Daisy sent her running gladly back through the gardens to her own friends . Ram was the Prince Valensky at last . Not only had he inherited the London house and its valuable antique contents , with the exception of the Faberge animals which had been left to Anabel , along with a certain amount of Rolls-Royce stock , but he had inherited all the polo ponies and the stables in Trouville and Kent and one half of Stash 's fortune , both in Rolls-Royce stock and all that remained of the Swiss gold . Stash had left Daisy the other half of his fortune , all of it invested in Rolls stock . Several weeks after the le ( grave Square Gymkhana had convinced him that Daisy should n't be in charge of her affairs until she turned thirty , he had made Ram ,  | that dependable , clever boy , co-trustee of her inheritance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was in charge . Yet he had a nagging sense of incompletion , as if his father , in dying so suddenly , had remained intact , as if Stash were still the Prince Valensky . There was a sense of unfinished business about the whole thing  --  something not done , something not finished , something not won . That summer , at Anabel 's house , La Margie , there were never fewer than eight people at any meal , and often more than a dozen . Anabel 's invitations were eagerly accepted by everyone she knew . As she had grown older  --  she was now almost forty-eight  --  she collected around herself an atmosphere more filled with intimacy than ever before , as more and more people found her the perfect confidante . She wore their secrets like priceless pearls tucked inside the neckline of a thin dress so that only a faint glimmer of them showed that they were there , but they added constant new depth to her ageless charm and the comfort of her presence . One of her friends , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cleansed of sin after he 'd talked to her as if he 'd been to confession , only  --  and this was the best of all  --  he had not had to promise never to sin again . La Margie was a house which could be described by no other word in the language except enchanted . There must be in the world many great houses on the top of thickly wooded hills overlooking the sea , but no one who had ever spent any time at La Margie had failed to be marked for life by its strange , poetic , nostalgic , tenderly mysterious atmosphere . It stood behind high walls and acres of overgrown gardens , on the ate de Grace , the thickly shaded , narrow road that mounts steeply up from Honfleur in the direction of Deauville . From the windows of the house , on all but the front facade , there was a high view over the entire estuary of the Seine , with Le Havre clearly visible in the opalescent distance . Behind the house was a wide gravel terrace from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two small farms . These woods were crisscrossed by a maze of hidden paths . Beyond the farms was the sea and on the sea was a constantly changing , gay armada of fishing and pleasure boats going in and out of the port of Honfleur . Farther out , great ocean liners and cargo ships passed back and forth . The terrace faced due west , and in the evening , when the sun was finally eaten by the horizon and the lights of Le Havre became visible , there was an  | almost unbearable poignancy about the moment which caused people to speak in lowered voices , or not at all . La Margie itself proved that magic still existed . It had grown out of an ancient farmhouse , little by little over the centuries , and by the time Anabel became its owner it possessed thirteen different levels of roof , each covered with thatch , from which , in the spring , seeds left in the straw would sprout and send up wild flowers . Some parts of the house were three stories high ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , was a single story ; but all the various parts of the structure were unified by being built from exposed wooden beams and plaster , most of which wore a rippling mantle of the big-leaved ivy called la vigne vierge , which turned bright red in the autumn . The enormous house looked more like a growing thing than a building , and the feeling inside of it was that of being part of a living , breathing space which belonged as much to the outdoors as the indoors . All day long the tall windows were thrown open to the sun and Anabel went out early to gather the basketsfull of columbine , coreopsis , roses , asters , lupines , delphinium , dahlias , heather , baby 's breath and the pied d'alouettes , an old-fashioned flower that appeared in Breugel 's paintings , from which she filled vases even more imaginatively and abundantly than she did in London where she was dependent on her florist 's stock to choose her blossoms . Although Anabel expected her guests to live at La Margie in an informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated with a certain formality . Each bedroom had walls of finely pleated damask , color on color , woven in flower motifs and hanging from floor to ceiling . The same fabric that covered the walls was draped on the four-poster beds and at the tall windows . Daisy 's room was all seagreen , Anabel 's rose and cream and Ram had the blue bedroom . The main salon of the house was enormously high and , in one corner , a circular staircase led up fourteen feet to the balcony that surrounded the room on three sides . The back of the balcony was lined with bookshelves and there were many recesses , invisible from below , in which one could spend all day on comfortable loveseats , reading from the slightly musty volumes which had been there when Stash acquired the house as a surprise for Anabel . It had suited him well because of its nearness to Trouville , where he had still owned the stables to which he had once taken Francesca . He had also been attracted by the legend of the house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former owner , Madame Colette de Joinville , had  | hidden eleven British soldiers after Dunkirk . Unable to reach the evacuation beach , they had been guided to her by the Resistance , of which she was a member . At great personal risk , she kept them safe in her attic for nine months until they were all able , one by one , to make their way to Spain , through the Underground , and return to England to fight again . Soon the routine life of La Maree established itself : late breakfast at the long wooden table in the big kitchen , to which they all drifted when they pleased , dressed in bathrobes or pegnoirs , after which , Daisy and Anabel , with sturdy market baskets on their arms , went shopping for fresh produce in the port of Honfleur . Lunch was preceded by sherry on the terrace , lasted for two hours and was followed by coffee , again on the terrace . After coffee each followed his own pursuit : antique hunting , sightseeing , napping or rambling in the countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poker or liar 's dice , and an early bedtime ended the lazy day . Daisy found that she was least unhappy when she was alone with her sketch pad , drawing the unforgivably picturesque houses of Le Vieux Bassin in Honfleur , a favorite painter 's subject for the last hundred and fifty years , or in trying to capture on paper the three umbrella pines that guarded the ocean side of La Maree . When Daisy took her bath she saw that day after day in the open air had tanned her to the color of a freshly baked croissant . She was not used to looking at herself naked she realized , as she studied with fascination the interesting contrast between her white breasts and her tan shoulders , marked with white only where the straps of her jerseys covered them . Then she was white again right down to the place where her tennis shorts ended and from then on , her legs were even tanner than the rest of her . She turned around and around in front of the mirror , half amused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half admiring the new high fullness of her wellseparated breasts and the sleek , long curve of her flanks . Daisy was sexually backward for her age of fifteen and a few months . She had led a severely protected life dominated by a father who had not allowed her contact with boys of her own age . Her friends at school had been those whose sexuality was still invested in horses and dogs . She had often been restlessly aware of physical desires but they had been either suppressed or released in sports . She rubbed her hand questioningly over her white-blonde pubic hair and hastily removed it when she saw what she was doing in the mirror . It was softer than the hair on her head , Daisy thought , oddly embarrassed , and she quickly dressed  | herself in her summer uniform : worn , tight tennis shorts from the year before that she had n't bothered to replace and one of the sleeveless striped fishermen 's jerseys she had bought in Honfleur . She wore her hair loose , and often , after one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bud would be caught in the tangled excess of her curls . Ram was violently critical of the way she looked . " Christ , Anabel , ca n't you speak to her about the way she goes about ? She 's like some sort of savage . It 's not only disgraceful , it 's damned near indecent . I ca n't stand to look at her ! You 're not doing the job you should be with that girl  --  I 'm surprised at you letting her get away with being such a pig ! " " Ram , come on , relax . Honfleur 's a resort  --  everyone dresses like Daisy , " Anabel chided him gently . " You 're the one who should let down a bit and get into the spirit of things  --  do I see the playing fields of Eton around your neck , my dear ? " Ram refused to even smile but stalked off , stiff with outrage . Hurt , Anabel shook her head sadly as he disappeared . Every time Daisy tried to talk to him , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unpleasant way , until the girl had almost stopped trying to include him in her conversations . Still , there was nothing Anabel could do except try to reach Ram through gentleness . . . she thought that this was probably his own strange way of reacting to Stash 's death , this anger , this .. . almost . . . cruelty . A few days later , at breakfast , as Ram unwisely tried to take a glance at the newspaper before he 'd started his bacon and eggs , Theseus gobbled down everything on his plate . Ram lashed out at the dog with his fist but Theseus was long gone . " Damn it to hell , Daisy , that goddamned verminous mongrel of yours has got to go ! " Ram 's face was knit in thundering fury . " I 'll kill that creature when I catch him ! " " If you touch him , I 'll kill you ! " Daisy shouted . " Children , children , " Anabel murmured ineffectively . " I 'm warning you , Daisy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ram continued . " He 's not a joke anymore . " Daisy held out her own plate at him . " Look , take my breakfast , it 's just the same as the one Theseus had  --  Ram , you put temptation in his way  --  you ought to know him by now . And he 's not dirty ! Here . Do n't be mad . " Ram thrust away the proffered plate . " I 'm not hungry anymore . And I 'm sick of your excuses for that filthy beast . Just keep him away from me . " Abruptly he got up from the table and went to his room .  | " Oh , dear , oh , dear , " sighed Anabel . If only people would be kinder to each other . Of all human sins , the only one Anabel really found unforgivable was unkindness . Toward the end of the first week in July , Anabel awaited with particular anticipation the arrival of her friends Guy and Isabelle de Luciny , who were bringing their children ; Valerie , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jean-Marc , who was almost eighteen . She hoped that their company might entice Daisy away from her solitary expeditions . She remembered Jean-Marc as a sturdy lad of fifteen , rather short and plump , but pleasant and well-spoken . She scarcely recognized the tall , attractive Frenchman with fine brown eyes who got out of the car and came toward her as she stood , welcomingly , in the circular entrance hall of the house . His manners were as polished and suave as only those of an almost adult , well-bred French youth can be , and it amused Anabel wickedly to see this selfpossessed and rather lordly young sprig fall for Daisy as acrobatically , as dramatically as if he 'd been hit over the head in a silent movie . He followed her around more closely than Theseus ; he literally could n't move his eyes away from her , which made him difficult at meals since he ate without looking at his food and he never heard a word anyone else said , not even a request to pass the salt . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean-Marc , who insisted on accompanying them into Honfleur each morning for their shopping , carrying Daisy 's basket , but eventually she began to respond to the smitten youth , with a kind of mischievous pleasure , the first she 'd shown in many weeks . " Honestly , Jean-Marc , I think I 'm going to have to take legal measures . There 's something curiously adoptable about you , " she told him after lunch one day as the whole houseful of guests lay lazily on the terrace , except for the young man who was busily dragging his striped canvas deck chair closer to Daisy 's . Her clear voice was heard by all the others , and Isabelle de Luciny and Anabel exchanged hopeful glances . Under the influence of Jean-Marc 's admiration , a new Daisy appeared at dinner , a Daisy who had taken the time to change into a mini-skirt and a thin summer sweater and offered to pour the coffee after dinner , a grown-up duty which she had occasionally attempted with a lack of interest , but which she now accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Guy de Luciny she  | received his words with the poise of a much older woman , sliding her black eyes toward Jean-Marc with a look that seemed both insolent and alluring , as if to ask why he had left it to his father to say the things he was thinking . Now Daisy permitted Jean-Marc to go with her on her trips into Honfleur to sketch , and several times the two of them were late for lunch , returning flushed with the sun and still trembling with laughter over jokes they assured the others they would n't understand . On the night of Bastille Day , the Quatorze Juillet , there is dancing in the streets in every city in France . In Honfleur the square in front of the town hall is turned into an outdoor ballroom and everyone , townspeople , tourists and the owners of the houses in the surrounding countryside , all come and dance with anyone who asks them , stranger or not . Daisy wore her best dress , from a London boutique called Mexicana , a long , demure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milkmaid sleeves were both made of bands of lace alternating with bands of finely tucked cotton . The lace and cotton formed a high , frilled collar . A hot pink satin sash with a big bow at the side was tightly clasped about her waist and below it fell a tucked cotton skirt with a wide lace hem which swept the floor . She had taken just the top layer of her hair , divided it into six sections and braided each section with white silk ribbons which ended in bows at the end of each braid . The innocence of the covered-up white dress and the beribboned braids contrasted strongly with Daisy 's straight , thick brows and excited pansy-centered eyes . Her full mouth was endowed with a new maturity as she felt for the first time in her life the intoxicating bonedeep assurance that tonight she was the unquestioned center of the group , the key to the romance of the evening . She had become an enchantress ; in one stroke , she had absorbed and embodied the spirit of La Magee . None of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Anabel gleefully , as if they had all turned into a band of besotted Jean-Mares  --  all but Ram , whose disapproval of his half-sister seemed to have been accentuated by her success . He stood aside , an unpleasant expression crossing his aquiline features , his gray eyes colder than those of his father had ever been . Anabel was glad that Daisy had always had courage . It takes courage to be a beautiful woman , she thought . Beauty , in Anabel 's estimation , is the female equivalent of going to war , bound , as beauty is , to put a woman in hundreds of unwanted situations that otherwise  | she could have avoided . And Daisy was almost a beautiful woman ? she had only a year or two of girlhood left , Anabel thought , with pity . . . and a little envy . The entire house party , some fourteen people , drove down to town to dance and watch the fireworks . Daisy , as conspicuous as a bride , and as lively as the traditional guinguette music which demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the arms of a fisherman to a local painter to the Mayor of Honfleur to Jean-Marc ; from the arms of the butcher to the arms of the sailors from the French Navy vessels moored in the port and then back to Jean-Marc again . She held herself as proudly as a young tree in its first season of spring bloom , her silvery hair flew and flew and even the braids could n't prevent it from getting tangled as she danced . Her lips were parted in a smile of pure , unthinking , undirected pleasure . Her cheeks were flushed a deeper pink and the punctuation of her black eyes made the vivid , flying figure in its white dress elementally alluring . As the music went on and on far into the night , Daisy danced with every man in Honfleur except Ram , who had danced not at all , preferring to stand aloof on the edge of the crowded circle of jostling figures , arms crossed , eyes baleful , watching the merrymaking with an oddly malevolent expression on his face . Finally , Anabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive home , if only out of pity for the band , which was starting to look as if they would be glad to stumble back straight into the Bastille if only they did n't have to play another tune . The next morning everyone was late for breakfast . Jean-Marc missed the meal completely . It was n't until after he 'd also been absent for lunch that his mother finally went to his room to wake him . She found his bed empty and a note addressed to her on the pillow . Dear Maman , I had a discussion with Ram last night which makes it impossible for me to remain here one minute more . I 'll be back in Paris by this afternoon . I have a key to the apartment so do n't worry . Please make my apologies to Anabel and thank her for the time I 've spent here . I 'd rather not explain any further , but I could n't stay . Do n't be upset . Love , Jean-Marc Astonished , Isabelle took the note to Anabel.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to you ? " " Ram ? I do n't understand it at all . What on earth could Ram have had to do with it ? If he 'd had a fight with Daisy I would n't be a bit surprised if poor Jean-Marc disappeared  --  but Ram ? " " I 'm going to ask him , " said Isabelle , with serious maternal irritation . She and Anabel began to search the house . Before lunch that day , Daisy had taken her sketch pad and gone to one of her favorite , secret places in the woods , a sweet-smelling eucalyptus grove thickly carpeted with aromatic leaves , from which there was a clear view of a small farmhouse . She often spent long hours drawing there , listening to the faint sounds of the barnyard far below , completely hidden from the world . Her triumph of the night before had left her languid , too lazy to get down to work , and she had stretched out on the leaves and slept for hours . She woke to hear footsteps crashing through the wooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and saw Ram walking at a fast pace . " Ram , I 'm here , " she called , sleepily . Ram entered the grove and stood directly in front of her , without a greeting . Daisy looked up at him and laughed . " If you 've come to see my view , you happen to be blocking it . " He threw himself down at her side , on the leaves , and roughly , silently , knocked the sketch book out of her hands . Then he took all her precious pencils and broke them in two and threw the pieces away furiously . Daisy watched him , speechless , incredulous . " I 've gotten rid of Jean-Marc so you need n't bother to go dangling yourself in front of him like a slut anymore ! " he burst out in a strangled voice . " That exhibition last night was the last straw  --  I 've never seen anything so disgusting , so degrading in my life  --  the way you slobbered over every sailor , every fisherman , every damned farmer  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " What ? " Daisy did n't know what he was talking about . " Do n't pretend that you do n't understand exactly what I mean ? all dressed up , pressing yourself against the local idiots  --  everything for everybody ! And as for your love , your precious Jean-Marc , I told him that maybe it 's done in France to come to visit and seduce the daughter of the house , but only a filthy , rotten swine would be such a shit . " " Seduce ? But you 're insane . Oh , Ram , I only let him kiss me on the cheek  --  he 's fun , that 's all , I swear it . How could he be my love ? You 've got it all wrong , " Daisy said , gazing indignantly at Ram , her  | voice ringing with truth and surprise . He kept his eyes fixed on the ground , stubbornly holding on to his jealous anger , his face set in disbelief . " Ram , look at me , " Daisy commanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " She put out her hand and tried to turn his head toward her , but , at her touch , he flinched away , making an animal sound of protest . " No , no , Ram , that 's just not fair ! " Daisy cried out . And innocently , out of her lack of sophistication , moved by an impulse to heal the hurt she saw on his beloved , sullen face , with fatal simplicity , she kissed him full on his stern mouth . The gesture obliterated sanity for Ram . Groaning , he took her into his arms and buried his face in her hair . He kissed her hair over and over again , shaking in every limb with repressed emotion , halfrage , half-desire . He tried , for one brief moment , not to kiss her lips but a red wind of passion drew him to them . He gave up the struggle and devoured her lips with his own , kissing her as if he were dying of thirst and her mouth were a moist fruit . Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself up to the joy of realizing that Ram , whom she had never stopped loving since she first saw him , Ram who had always been the secret hero of her dreams , Ram from whom she had hopelessly begged a smile or even a mere word , was holding her tight , being kind to her , good to her , kissing her . She abandoned herself to the comfort of this fulfillment of years of yearning , all thoughts blotted out . Daisy , who had never been kissed on the lips before made the discovery of the mouth of another , of the roughness of his shaven cheeks , of the hardness of teeth , the wetness of his tongue . She kissed him back as if each kiss could bring back the life she had carelessly romped and reveled in , bring back happiness , kiss it into returning . Daisy gave herself so completely to the happiness of being  --  after so many years  --  held and kissed by Ram , that she did n't realize that he had opened the buttons of her thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipples of her breasts . The feeling was the most exquisite she 'd ever known  --  his beloved mouth tugging on the tender , sensitive buds  --  a feeling too new , so rapturously new and good that tears stung her eyes . In a flash Daisy felt all the intimations of physical passion she had never localized before , this girl to whom a gallop on a bright morning had been the height of pleasure of the body . Her pale , pale pink nipples grew firm and pinker as he kissed them , holding her breasts in each of his hands , and her head fell back  | on her willing neck as she surrendered to his lips and his fingers , feeling his hair against her shoulder , unhearing , unthinking , a creature of feeling only . She was dazed , almost paralyzed by the electric flashes of desire which were whipping through her body , when suddenly she returned to reality . Ram was fumbling at the waistband of her shorts , trying to take them off . She pushed him away as hard as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden panic , her belated realization . She struggled with him , her mind a jungle of confusion . What had happened ? How had it happened ? What was going to happen ? Soon , in spite of all her efforts , she was naked , her brown and white body revealed in all its terrified beauty . " No ! No ! " she panted , " please , no ! " But Ram was deaf to her pleas , deaf to her sobs . His face was as inhuman as a spear as he bent over her body . Nothing , no one could stop him now . In an ecstasy of lust he pried open her thighs and quickly , pouncing , found the opening he had to find , and drove himself into her , pounding brutally through the tender flesh because she was a virgin and he had to have her or die of anger and need . Daisy 's mind stopped working . Spangles of red and white and black exploded in her brain like the fireworks of the night before . Even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she clung to his plunging body because , more than anything , she was desperate for reassurance that this cruel stranger was Ram , her Ram  --  only that knowledge would prevent her from being annihilated . Afterward it was the man who sobbed and the girl who held and comforted him , kissing his dark hair and whispering , " It 's all right , it 's all right , " clinging to him like the survivor , of a vast tempest , eucalyptus leaves sticking to her back , the mingled smell of sweat and sperm rising to her nostrils for the first time in her life , her thighs stained with blood which she blotted away with pages of the broken sketch pad . When Daisy looked at Ram , his head hidden in her arms , prodigal flares of dark light came from her eyes . Although , instinctively , she tried to reassure him , she was herself drowning in a murky pool of feelings , totally foreign in a life in which she had always seen her way clearly and cleanly . Daisy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mixed with a kind of shame she had never known before . Her whole mind and body ached with acute conflict and resentment . She wanted to bite , to kick , to shriek to high heaven , to faint , to run away . She wanted to go hack to where she had been only an hour ago , but she knew  | already that there was no return . Deep within her something sounded , as if the string of a great cello had been plucked , a note of remote , mysterious but unmistakable warning . When they finally returned to the house , the sunset was so brilliant that it partially blinded the eyes of anyone looking toward the woods which lay between the house and the horizon . The rest of the de Luciny family , having been unable to find Ram or come to any satisfactory explanation of the mystery of Jean-Marc 's departure , had hastily packed and left for Paris . Anabel was in the salon , as Ram and Daisy materialized out of the woods , several feet separating them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , almost running , but Anabel was able to collar Ram before he started up the stairs . " Ram ! We 've been looking everywhere for you . For God 's sake , what happened with Jean-Marc ? " she demanded . " It 's not something I want to talk about . " " What nerve  --  you drove him away somehow  --  you 'd better have a good reason . " " Anabel , I 'm telling you that it 's best left alone . " She stood up , moved to unusual anger . " Now , just what the hell happened ? " " Since you insist  --  Jean-Marc made some disgustingly improper remarks about Daisy and I told him he was n't a gentleman . " " Oh , for heaven 's sake , Ram , you sound like something out of the eighteenth century . Improper remarks ? What on earth are you talking about ? Just what did he say ? " " Look , I refuse to have Daisy insulted , that 's all . Jean-Marc apparently thinks English girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He never said that ! " Anabel cried . " You were n't there . You would have been as revolted with him as I was , " Ram insisted coldly . " Oh , what a total mess ! He probably did n't mean what you thought at all . And since when have you been Daisy 's champion ? And now they 've all gone off three days before they were supposed to leave and there 's been such an unnecessary scene . I do wish , Ram , that you 'd try to develop a sense of humor , " Anabel said with unaccustomed asperity.  | " The fact that he ran off with his tail between his legs speaks for itself , " Ram answered , obdurate . Anabel looked at her watch and was startled . " Ram , do n't you realize that we still have a houseful of guests and that it 's time for drinks ? At least make yourself useful and run down into town for me and get some ice  --  the fridge is acting up , as if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , Ram , I 'm fed up ! " As he left on his errand , Anabel thought that difficult as he had been since she 'd known him , she had never been quite as angry at Ram as she was now . Nor had he ever seemed more indifferent to how she felt , now that she thought about it . Nevertheless , as she surveyed her dinner table an hour and a half later , Anabel had to admit to herself that whatever it was that had been changed in the atmosphere of La Margie by the departure of JeanMarc and his family , only good had come of it , unpleasant as the preceding day had been . It was the most agreeable evening she could remember of the entire summer . Everyone seemed touched with kindness and good will and jovial spirits and they were not caused just by the four bottles of champagne Ram had brought back from his errand to buy ice . Perhaps , she mused , it was because Ram himself had finally relaxed and lost that cruel , unforgiving look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He played the host with charm and a grace which Anabel , herself the consummate hostess , could thoroughly appreciate . Although only his gray eyes physically reminded her of Stash , there was something of Stash in the way he dominated the table , yet refrained from taking over , allowing each guest to shine . He had a special air of being at home that Stash had always adopted unthinkingly wherever he went ; he was gracious and gallant to all the ladies and with the men he seemed more mature than his twenty-two years , almost their equal , yet he retained a flashing , youthful gaiety that she was touched to see in him , in spite of her fading anger . It was so unlike Ram to express easy happiness that she could n't begrudge it . As for Daisy , although her cheeks were red and her eyes almost feverish , she was subdued . Anabel made a mental note to have a serious talk with the child about getting too much sun : did she want that skin of hers to be tanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty ? Tonight Daisy did n't offer to pour the coffee but gladly left it to Anabel , and the capriciousness which she 'd been practicing on poor Jean-Marc was absent . She seemed disoriented and far-away , as if she had been sapped of her usual  | energy , and no wonder , Anabel decided . That riotous , nonstop night of dancing yesterday would be bound to cause a reaction in such a young girl . She was n't surprised when Daisy decided to go to bed almost as soon as the late dinner was over . Once she had shut herself into her sea-green refuge , Daisy collapsed on her bed . She was in such confusion of mind and body and spirit that it had taken all her resources to get through dinner . Too much had happened for her to think about it coherently . In her mind she was still lying in that eucalyptus grove , still hearing Ram 's voice saying her name . Uncontrollable vibrations swept over her newly awakened body . She quivered from her toes to her scalp . She unbraided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dress and flung open the windows , hoping that the sight of Le Havre gleaming in the far distance might calm her , but the slightly misty air was too soft and the stars over the sea hung too low and the crickets were chirping in a way which she had never noticed before , a way that she could barely endure . She had never understood why adults asked each other how they had slept . That night Daisy was initiated into the great company of those who have passed sleepless nights . " White nights " the French call them , a night filled with thoughts she could n't escape . The thing that had happened  --  Ram had n't meant to do it ! He was sorry  --  had he not wept , had he not said he was sorry , over and over ? Of course it would never happen again . Of course they must never let anyone know . These tormented thoughts mixed and whirled with thoughts of Ram 's lips , Ram 's words of love , above all his words of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said he had always loved her . First one thought attacked her , then another , then they twined painfully round and round in her brain until , blessedly , at last the sun rose and touched the tops of the umbrella pines in front of her window , and she knew she could get up and find Theseus , who now slept outside , and take him for a good long run before breakfast . Ram had never been so happy in his life . He felt as if only today had he become himself . He had come into his full heritage . He finally was the Prince Valensky with all the prerogatives that title implied . Of course , Daisy was meant to belong to him , just as everything his father had had was meant to belong to him . He looked back at the past weeks and realized what a fool he 'd been , how he 'd been angry and cold and unkind to her when it was only the simple injustice of not possessing Daisy that was the cause of his feelings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being his half-sister , it simply did n't matter . There could be no barrier , when two people are not brought up together , Ram told himself . Why , he had n't even given a thought to Daisy 's existence until he was fourteen . Not for them the shared family warmth , the well-worn jokes , the cloying familiarity of ordinary people . They had seen each other only on scattered holidays , almost totally separated by age and interests . In fact , he smiled to himself , they had been the closest thing to born enemies that two children of the same father could be . No . Ordinary rules for ordinary people did not apply to him and he most certainly was n't going to concern himself with them , just as his father never had . Of course , he would make sure that other people  --  particularly Anabel who was basically conventional , in his opinion , in spite of the fact that she 'd been his father 's mistress  --  did n't meddle in business that did n't concern them  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of everything he was and would become , of everything that , at last , he owned , that he , too , spent a sleepless night . " Let 's go to the stables and decide what to do about the polo ponies , " Ram said to Daisy the next morning . They were the only ones in the kitchen . Even the cook was still asleep and they had made breakfast for themselves , each unexpectedly shy and glad of the business of frying eggs and looking for the wild strawberry jam the cook always hid . " I thought you did n't want to make any decisions about them ? That 's what you said to Anabel . " " That was the other day  --  but I ca n't have that whole lot , not just the horses but the men , too , eating their heads off in Trouville and not do something about it . Either I 'll keep them or I 'll sell them  --  but first we 'll go take a look . " " I 'll be ready in fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daisy ran upstairs to get into her riding clothes , her heart beating lawlessly . They were gone all day , like truants , riding for hours in the green fields , changing from one pony to another , and finally , worn out , they flung themselves under a tree to eat a picnic lunch of long , mild , buttered radishes and a crusty loaf filled with ham and cheese that had been provided by the wife of the stable manager . Eventually Ram decided that since he did n't play polo he 'd put all the ponies up for auction at the first opportunity . There was no point in keeping even the best of them for ordinary riding ; they were  | too finely bred , too nervous for his taste ; he liked a larger horse , a good jumper , and Daisy had just acquired a fine pale bay with a black mane and tail who was stabled back in London , so she did n't need another mount . During the long day and the drive back neither Ram nor Daisy referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they turned into the driveway of La Margie , Ram took one hand off the steering wheel and laid it , heavy with authority , on top of her thigh . " I 'm going to kiss you there , right there , tonight , " he said brusquely . She did n't dare look at him . Her whole body was blushing . Emotions spilled over which had been trembling near the surface all day , held in check only by the constant exercise into which they had thrown themselves . " No , Ram ! " she said in a low tone of prohibition which blotted out everything else , even the sight of some of the guests playing badminton in the garden . " Be quiet , " he ordered her , and she was quiet , finding , from somewhere , a smile with which to greet the others , an expert smile she did n't know she owned , a social smile and a social voice . That night , after all the lights of the house were off , Ram tapped on the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her answer . He locked it behind him . Daisy was on the window seat , her knees drawn up under her , her arms circling her legs , her chin on her knees , as if she 'd been sitting there thinking for a long time . He walked over to her and swept back the pale curtain of hair which fell over the near side of her face . She did n't move as she tilted her face so that he could see her eyes . " We must not , Ram , " she said . " Daisy , you 're still a baby . There are n't any stuffy musts or must nots for us  --  except that we must love each other . " " But not like . . . not what you did yesterday . . . Ram , just .. . sweetness , just being together , " she said , hope and supplication mingled in her voice . " Darling Daisy , " he said , " just being together . " He put both his arms around the entire slim circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lay there , hugging herself , stiff , silently resisting , abashed . When he kissed her the first time she pressed her lips tightly together and tried to turn her head away , but he would n't allow it . Very gently , very tenderly , but with absolute conviction , he parted her lips with the tip of his tongue . Now that he owned her he could  | take her slowly , surely . Her breath caught in her throat as she felt his tongue press on her clenched teeth and then felt it retreat to circle her lips , until she felt that her mouth was a ring of fire . Gradually , in spite of herself , she uncoiled her limbs as his lips traveled up her neck to her ear lobe . " Daisy , my Daisy , " he whispered into her ear in a voice so soft that she could barely hear him . With a plaintive sigh she threw her arms around his neck and held him with all her strength . Oh , how content she was with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection . She felt sheltered , protected , safe from everything and everyone , a security she had thought she had lost forever when she was told of her father 's death . " Hug me tight , " she asked . " Just hug me tight , only hold me , Ram , promise me , promise me ... " " Yes , Daisy , yes , " Ram answered , while his fingers stealthily untied the ribbons of her long peignoir . " Yes , I 'll hug you , my darling , I 'll hug you . " And he felt the outline of her small , firm breasts with careful , traitorous hands , brushing lightly over the tips of her nipples again and again until they rose to his touch and became so singingly sensitive that he knew he could bend his head and suck them and she would n't beg to be hugged anymore . He filled his mouth with the delicate rosettes , remembering their pale pinkness , still gently , still tenderly , until she lay back on the pillow giving herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each nipple to her vulva , as if some crucial nerves had been activated , connections she 'd never known existed . Ram had been erect from the second he 'd touched Daisy on the window seat but instinctively he had known to keep his rigid penis from touching any part of her , until she was led , step by step , into desire . Now he took one of her hands in his . " Daisy , feel how much I love you . " He guided her hand to his penis and closed her hand around the quivering organ . She jerked her hand away immediately , shocked , struck with fearful alarm . He did n't try to make her touch him again but covered her lips with deep , slow , hot kisses , until he kit her mouth open of its own accord , until he felt her tongue tentatively reach out to touch his . For half an hour he kissed her mouth and sucked her nipples until he could feel her beginning , just beginning , to stir her hips , unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he whispered again , " Daisy , touch me , touch me . . . you 'll feel how much I love you ... please touch me , " and he took her hand again . This time she was too deeply bemused by her own aroused passion to  | resist . He took her hot fingers and tried to show them how to clasp his painfully engorged penis , but he had reckoned without his own towering desire . At the touch of Daisy 's hand he realized that he was about to come to orgasm . Ram clutched his penis in one hand and shoved it roughly into the girl , just as the spasms overtook him . He bit his tongue to keep from crying out in the silent house . Bewildered , and hurting , she felt him quake in great , silent tremors . After a brief time in which he lay panting , he kissed her once more . " Now , I 'll hold you , my little Daisy , " he muttered , and he lay , half asleep , clasping her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daisy did n't dare to move or speak . She was an accomplice . She had let him do it to her . If she protested he would fall into one of his sudden rages , or even worse , turn away from her and leave her all alone . But she could not be alone again . She had believed that all she wanted in Ram 's arms was protection , security and the feeling that someone loved her but now , painfully excited , and shipwrecked anew , she wanted . . . she did n't know what she wanted . Furtively she pressed her lips to his bare shoulder , and as she did so they heard someone open , and a minute later , shut a door along the corridor . " I 'd better leave , " Ram whispered . " Yes . " He left her with a hurried kiss , left her high and dry , burning , burning , sickened with desire , sickened with shame , burning , burning . The next day , after lunch , Anabel told Daisy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week had announced that they were coming that Daisy would have to share her room , since it had two beds in it . " I never dreamed they 'd all say yes , but it 's too late now . You 'll like your roommate , I hope  --  she 's an American girl , Kiki Kavanaugh , the daughter of an old friend of mine . Her mother is American too  --  she was Eleanor Williams when I first met her . She married a man who 's in the motor business in Detroit . " " I 'm half an American girl , too , Anabel  --  although I do n't feel it . " Do you remember much of it , Daisy ? " asked Anabel , struck by some note of pathos in the girl 's voice she did n't remember ever having heard before . " So little . Mostly this feeling of having been with Mother and Dani and Masha  --  and sort of a dream memory of the way things  | looked , the big waves on the beaches , the forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . I wish I could remember more . It seems as if my life was just split in half . " There was a wistfulness in her voice like the residue of sugar in an empty cup , the memory of uncomplicated sweetness . Anabel wished sharply that she had n't asked if Daisy remembered her American years  --  the girl looked even more weary than she had at dinner the night before , although at her age it was difficult to detect signs of fatigue . Ah well , the death of Stash was a period they all had to live through , no way of skipping it and just carrying on as if nothing had happened . Anabel herself had had to strain every emotional resource she possessed to keep the house full and lively . Her own impulse was to crawl into a quiet room and just let desolation wash over her , but she could n't permit herself to do that , mainly for the sake of Daisy . There were no more words between them as they sat on the striped canvas deck chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , at this hour , was too bright to look at . Anabel had the gift of reposeful silence and she never asked what anyone else was thinking , a simple combination which had been only one of the many things men loved , that few other women had ever understood .  | In the course of the following week , Ram came to Daisy 's room every night . Now that he possessed her the feelings he had repressed for longer than he realized had been freed . They burst , full blown , into obsessive madness . He could think of nothing else but Daisy . At last he had her to himself , at last his father did n't come first with her , at last he could do as he wished with her . At night he waited only until the corridor was clear before he slipped through her door . He no longer cared if other lights were on in the house once he had locked the door . As soon as he saw the secret , tender whiteness of her breasts and her belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine of her hair , as soon as he felt her amber arms around him , he became so inflamed with the need to take her that all consideration , all caution , all vestiges of reason left him . And she was dominated by him , totally suffused with a strange mixture of wanting , still wanting , his kisses and yet dreading what she now knew he would eventually do to her . Each night , in torment , she waited for him , thinking that this time she would have the will to prevent him , and each night she failed . There was never any physical release for Daisy , and she was so naive , so untutored that she had no clear idea of what there might have been . Even if she had known , she would have been too ashamed to ask for it , because to ask for it would have been to participate even more than he forced her to in the thing he did to her . She concentrated only on the minutes of kissing and holding and being held and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . And afterward , there was her punishment ; the dizzy fog of misery and sticky , blood-heavy frustration that enveloped her throughout the long , hot days . Unlike Ram , Daisy felt intolerable guilt , although she was too innocent to identify the emotion clearly , experiencing it as crushing fatigue and a black sadness . But she was torn by her continuing need for Ram , a need as strong as her guilt . She had loved him since she  | was six and she did n't know how to break away from his hold on her . Guilt and her fear of having no one to hold on to , no one to belong to her , fought inside of her daily and she grew more unhappy and confused and unable to think things through . . . to think at all . " Daisy , let 's go into Deauville for the day , just the two of us , and do some shopping . The boutiques are full of fall clothes  --  we could see what 's going on at Dior and St. Laurent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need new things , " Anabel said , looking anxiously at the signs of something very wrong on Daisy 's face . " I 'm not in the mood to buy anything , Anabel  --  I 'm so worn out I do n't think I could stand to try on clothes . " " Then I have a great notion . I 've always wanted to try that spa near the boardwalk  --  it 's supposed to make you feel marvelous ? rejuvenation therapy . First they pound you with sea water from a giant hose and whip up your circulation , then you soak in a hot tub full of bubbling sea water , then a long massage and finally they wrap you up in towels like a baby and make you rest in a deck chair for half an hour . It 's all over by tea time , and , afterward , we 'd go directly out to tea and chocolate eclairs . Why do n't we try it ? " " It sounds like water torture to me , " Daisy said indifferently . Anabel , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese that has been prized since the thirteenth century , or even just lunch at the Ferme St. Simeon , at the bottom of their hill , where the Impressionists used to meet , a favorite treat for Daisy in former years . But Daisy refused all of Anabel 's suggestions , on one pretext or another . She did n't want to be alone with her secret and Anabel . She was afraid that Anabel , always so sensitive to mood , might divine the truth . She was even more afraid that she might tell Anabel . And then  --  what would Ram do to her ? One afternoon , disconsolate and restless , Daisy secluded herself in one of the deep recesses of the balcony of the salon , intending to attempt to read Balzac in French , something the honorable Miss West , French mistress at Lady Alden 's , had suggested for all the girls ' summer vacations . Before she was more than three pages into the dusty volume , barely understanding a word of what she read , Ram discovered her hiding place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , with reproach in his voice . " Why are you stuck away up here  --  it 's gorgeous out . " " I wanted to be alone . " " Well , I want to talk to you . I 've decided what to do with the  | house in London . It 's far too big for us  --  Father never needed all that space  --  and the real-estate market 's never been better . I 'm going to sell it and buy a house that makes sense ; one that does n't need more than three or four servants to run . I think we should live in Mayfair , Upper Brook Street or South Audley Street  --  somewhere in that general area . " " You mean  --  live together ? " She gaped at him . " Obviously . You have to live somewhere . Do you think you 're old enough to live alone ? " " But , I thought , I assumed  --  I 'd be living with Anabel , Ram , not with you , " Daisy said with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't permit it . Anabel will have found another man to keep her within a few months and you ca n't be exposed to that sort of thing . " " Ram ! That 's a beastly , stinking thing to say  --  Anabel 's like my mother ! " " That only proves I 'm right  --  you 're too much of a baby to understand that Anabel lives off rich men  --  always has and always will . " " It 's not true ! How can you be so awful ? " " Then why did Father never marry her ? " Daisy faltered , unable to answer his question . Frantically she turned to another objection . " What about the servants ? What are you going to do with them ? " " Pension them off , of course , " Ram said in an indifferent voice . " They 're far too old  --  every last , decrepit one of them  --  and there 's no good in thinking that we 're doomed to keep them doddering about until they drop dead one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of Father 's crazy extravagances , like putting all his money into Rolls-Royce for sentimental reasons . I 'm getting out of Rolls , Daisy , and I 'm taking your money out , too . It 's high time we put that money to work  --  and time to get as much of it out of England as possible ! " " Ram , no ! You ca n't sell my stock . . . Father left it to me and I 'm not going to sell . " " Daisy , " Ram said reasonably , " the market 's no place for emotional attachments . I 'm the legal trustee of your money and if I want to sell your stock I can . " " Would you do that to me ? Against my will ? " she blazed at him .  | The stock in Rolls-Royce suddenly seemed all she had left to cling to , a real and tangible relic of her father 's concern , of his caring protection , of the fact that she still possessed a link to the past that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell with that , " he barked . " Keep the stock if it means so much to you . " " And my horse ? Where will I keep her ? " Daisy asked , struggling to find another fixed element of her life that Ram could n't wipe away with a word . " We 'll find another stable , nearby our new house  --  do n't worry . You can have two dozen white horses if you want , Daisy , and a kennel full of lurchers , " Ram said , relieved that Daisy seemed to be running out of reasons why they could not live together . " But your flat , " she said feebly , " you were so pleased with it . " " It 's far too small for the two of us . I can get rid of it in a flash , and at a profit . Father 's pictures will fetch a fortune at Sotheby 's , even though I 'm going to keep at least two Rembrandts and the furniture  --  my God , do you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days ? To say nothing of the icons  --  that will be a major sale just in itself . " " So you 're going to sell everything  --  everything I love , everything I grew up with , " she gasped , with stricken eyes . She wanted to writhe and tear at Ram , but she knew he could do whatever he wanted with his own property . He took her in his arms and crushed her body to him . " We 'll be together , just the two of us , and no old servants around to poke and pry and treat you like a child  --  you want that , do n't you ? " She did n't answer , gasping in outrage , and taking her silence for agreement , he thrust his hand under her shirt and cupped one of her breasts firmly , his thumb making circles around her nipple . Furious as she was , her nipple hardened and he pulled her shirt higher and fastened his mouth on it , sucking with a desperate , hasty need . His other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downy hair , fingertips blindly reaching for her special warmth . Daisy froze as she heard a light footstep mounting the staircase to the balcony , but deaf to everything , Ram pulled on her nipple harder than ever , as if he wanted to inhale her all in one mouthful . Daisy , with a terrified force she did n't know she possessed , pulled away and flung , herself as far from him as she could on the loveseat , pointing frantically in the direction of the footsteps while she pulled down her  | shirt . Dazed , Ram finally understood , and when Anabel appeared with a vase of flowers , she found the two of them sitting several feet apart , Daisy apparently engrossed in Balzac . " Children ! Oh , you frightened me ! I thought I was alone up here . Just look  --  are n't these Queen Elizabeth roses marvelous ? Daisy , they 're for your room . The Kavanaughs are coming tomorrow early and I 'm filling the house with flowers for them . " " Christ ! Not more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disgust . " You 'll like them , " Anabel said lightly , not , at the moment , really caring if he did or he did n't . She supposed they 'd been fighting again from the way they looked . Well , they 'd have to work it out between them , whatever it was . That night , as soon after dinner as possible , Daisy went upstairs to her room and locked herself in . Later Ram knocked several times , each time a little louder , and whispered her name . Defiantly she glared at the door and neither opened it nor answered him . Only when she heard him stride off did she allow herself to whimper in fear . Daisy fled La Margie at dawn the next morning , putting a big chunk of bread and an orange in her pocket . She roamed the country lanes of Honfleur with Theseus , keeping him firmly attached to a leash so that he did n't take off for any of the kitchens or farmyards of the neighborhood . She felt that she could somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when life was simple , when rules were made for her , when she knew the guidelines and lived within them happily . But as hours passed and the sun rose high overhead she realized that Anabel would be expecting her back for lunch . This was the day of the arrival of the new guests , Eleanor Kavanaugh and her daughter , with some sort of silly name , the one Anabel thought she 'd like . The idea of meeting new people was an almost unbearable complication right now , yet the girl would be sharing her bedroom , and that was a profound relief to Daisy , a respite she could n't have arranged herself . The Kavanaugh 's arrival at La Margie was announced from the driveway by an enormous , dark burgundy Daimler , parked in front of the door , with a dozen suitcases still being carried inside by their uniformed chauffeur . " Oh , bloody hell ! " said Daisy to herself , as she  | contemplated the scene . It was the most violent expression of disgust she knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the native islands . Did they think they were royalty ? She looked down at her dusty tennis shoes , her outgrown shorts , and her worn jersey . Her hair , she imagined , must look like a vulture 's nest . With luck , she judged , they might all be outside drinking sherry and she 'd have time to make herself presentable before she met them . Seeing no one , Daisy slipped up the staircase and quietly approached her room . She heard no noise inside , no sounds of unpacking , so she entered briskly , and then stopped , almost falling over her feet , at the sight of a girl curled up on her window seat , looking out at the sea . Too late . The girl turned and looked at Daisy with an expression of amazement . " You ca n't be Daisy ! " " Why not ? " " Daisy 's a little girl  --  fifteen or something . " " How old are you ? " " I 'm almost seventeen . " " Huh  --  you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressively . Five feet , two and three quarters of an inch of audacious female . She had frolicsome eyebrows , the face of a kitten who knows she 's the pick of the litter and a short , fluttering mop of once brown hair which she had just had streaked in Kelly green , a la Zandra Rhodes . Her big eyes were umber , a dark , dusky brown with yellow lights in them  --  the eyes of a waif ? spawn of a devil  --  and her beautifully shaped head was adorned with a pair of small , perfect , almost pointed ears . She was wearing what might have been either a Ukrainian wedding dress or something invented by a newly rich Afganistani princess , made of red pleated linen , largely embroidered , appliqued in gold lace , fringed , wrapped , and tied here and there with multicolored beads . She lacked only anklets of bells . " You 're absolutely sublime , whoever you are , " this apparition told Daisy . " I tried to convince Mother it was time to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could I know compared to the Queen of Grosse Pointe ? Wait till she sees you  --  will she be sorry she let me keep this hair . " " Ca n't you have it , ah . . . put back ? " Daisy suggested . " Try that and it falls out  --  I 'll just have to wait till it grows . Oh , balls ! I ca n't go out there and meet all those people like this . Will you  | lend me something to wear  --  shorts and a shirt ? And some of your hair ? " Kiki circled Daisy in rapt admiration . Even Daisy 's old shoes seemed to her to be the ultimate in throw-away chic . " But they 'd be way too big ... of course , I would , but you 'd swim in them , " answered Daisy , enthralled by this gypsy who had camped in her bedroom . " Oh , never mind , I 'm always like this when I see someone divinely tall and naturally silver-blonde and absolutely , incredibly beautiful  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart but I 'll be okay in a few minutes . I mean , I actually have a fairly healthy ego but bugger it all , wood nymphs set me back to square one . Do you like bugger ' ? I just learned it in England and I think it 's an awfully useful word . " She looked at Daisy , her raffish smile inquiring . " Lady Alden disapproved of bugger ' ? very strongly  --  so it must be a good word . We got the ruler if we ever used it . " " The ruler ! Capital punishment ? No , corporal punishment  --  or whatever . They 'd do that to you ? How dare they ? But then . . . you must be Daisy . " " Well , what would I be doing in this room if I were n't ? " " I thought ... well . . . never mind . No , scratch that . I 've made a resolution never to say never mind ' again . It drives people crazy and they always get it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb name , so sickeningly pristine , an anachronism . But now it 's just right for you , since you 're she . . . or her ? " " She . " " Lord have mercy , I just guess at grammar . You realize , I had this mental picture of a little girl called Daisy , a princess no less , and what do I find but a fucking goddess  --  I tell you , it 's enough to make me try to be mean  --  but who could be mean to you ? Listen , do you know what I hate the most in the world ? " Daisy never took her eyes off Kiki . She had just realized that Kiki had on green nail polish , green mascara , and green eyeshadow . " It 's those frantically welldressed people in Vogue who say they live in only three wonderful old skirts they had made to order fifteen years ago  --  by Main , of course , who else ? ? and just two plain black cashmere sweaters and then they add one perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of priceless , antique Chinese slippers  --  you know it 's a filthy lie but how can you prove it ? Shit , I 'll never get it right . " She slumped despondently in the middle of her elaborate costume . " Do n't change , do n't move , do n't despair , " said Daisy , suddenly  | restored to her role as the leader of Lady Alden 's . " I 'm coming right back . " She returned in five minutes , her hair all pulled up on the top of her head , skewered by pins into which she 'd tucked some of the purple bougainvilla which grew on the walls of the house . She wore a mini-dress of flashing silver paper which she 'd bought for three pounds at Biba . It could only be worn once and she had n't dared to take it out of her wardrobe until today . " Do you have any Paco Rabanne jewelry ? " she asked Kiki . " Does n't everyone ? Just a minute . " Kiki rummaged in one of her seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture which looked like a large , elaborately framed mirror , a chastity belt for the upper body . She clasped it around Daisy 's neck . " Earrings ? " " No  --  I think that might be too much . I 'll just wear bare feet ? same effect but less fuss . " " You ca n't be fifteen , " said Kiki flatly , admiringly . " I 'm wise beyond my years . Come on  --  let 's give the old people a shock they wo n't forget . " During the week of the Kavanaughs ' visit , Ram , for the first time in his life , found his generalized bitterness against the world turning to actual fantasies of murder  --  Kiki 's murder . Her mother could have told him that it could n't have been done without a silver bullet . Kiki , a brisk , practiced and roguish prankster , stood for having fun in a way which , in spite of her intelligence , had caused four of the best girls ' boarding schools in the United States to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . She had survived the inestimable damage of immunity enjoyed from earliest childhood , the damage which might have been caused by knowing , almost from the playpen , that she was a member of the only local aristocracy worth belonging to in Grosse Pointe , that of the motor industry ; as well as the damage which could have occurred as a result of being the longed-for daughter in a family of three older brothers ? she had survived because of a stern , inborn , incorruptible honesty . Kiki told the truth , to herself and to others , a trait so rare as to make her seem eccentric . Her honesty went hand in hand with her impulsiveness , and she and Daisy , separated in age by little more than a year and a half , fell into instant complicity . They were a match in their love of a dare , their fancy for the improbable project . If Kiki was far more worldly and sophisticated , Daisy was the braver and more  | stalwart of the two ; where Kiki was spoiled  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? Daisy was merely stubborn . The greatest difference in the two girls was in their emotional attachments . Kiki admitted to many , none of which troubled her  --  she took her father , her brothers and especially her mother for granted and found them , all of them , amusing  --  an attitude which puzzled and entranced Daisy . However , during the week Kiki and her mother spent at La Margie , the two girls spent little time in serious discussions . Like fillies let loose in a pasture , they were busy exploiting their new camaraderie . Daisy , after a long night of uninterrupted sleep , suddenly felt full of her old laughing vitality , as if she 'd had her youth returned to her , an unquestioning , untormented youth which led the two of them on expeditions into Honfleur to banter with the fishermen , to fill themselves with the Coca-Colas Anabel would n't have in the house , to buy coarse garlic sausages that they ate on the street , taking huge bites and talking with their mouths full . They hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly through the lobbies of the great hotels , like strolling players in their rich-hippie rig-outs , enjoying the outraged looks of the middle-aged women in their safe , laughably expensive Chanel suits . They kept a score of how many women they could stare down in any given lobby on any given day . They exchanged clothes avidly , finding that Daisy 's shorts and shirts would fit Kiki if she hitched them up with a belt and folded over the waist bands . Dressed alike , they ran up and down the beach at Trouville treating placid family groups to rude shouts . From a rented cabana they swam in the cold , northern waters , often arriving back late for meals at La Margie , with barely an excuse except to Anabel who did n't need one , since she was so delighted with the success of her hopes for a friend for Daisy . Kiki had only one complaint . " That brother of yours must simply loathe me , " she said to Daisy . " I 've been flirting with him like crazy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been getting absolutely nowhere with him  --  and that , I promise you , is something that does n't happen to me a whole lot . If at all ! Does he have something against Americans ? Or is it my green hair ? Is he queer ? I just do n't get it . " " Oh , Ram 's hopeless  --  forget him , it 's that Etonian superiority of his . He does n't mean to be rude . . . it 's just his way , " Daisy answered evasively . Could n't Kiki see how jealous he was , she wondered ? Of course not  --  how could Kiki imagine that she , Daisy , was clutching at her companionship in an effort never to be alone with Ram . She  | watched him at the dinner table staring at her , his eyelids hooded like those of a sculpture of a knight , killed long ago on a Crusade . Just the thin slivers of pupils peered out from his closed face , but she could feel Ram pulling at her across the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had been about to fall on her with kisses but the sound of Kiki , faithfully following her , had forced him to let go . Ram was both malignant and reckless in his powerlessness but Daisy managed to never be far from Kiki , admitting to herself that this shield could n't last for long , but using it to the full while it did . She needed this time apart from Ram , she needed it so much that she was willing to risk the punishment she knew she 'd have to face when it was over . Every night , for long after Kiki had fallen asleep , Daisy lay awake thinking , trying to put her emotions in some sort of order , but not succeeding . She sorted over and over the facts of her long love for Ram , her need for Ram , and her conviction , which grew every day , that what Ram did to her was utterly bad , utterly wrong , no matter what he thought . She once toyed with the idea of consulting Kiki , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use convinced her that it was impossible . The burden was one she had to bear alone , in shame . Dreadful , inescapable shame , shame unending . Finally the day came when the Kavanaughs had to leave for the Cote d'Azur , where they were to meet Kiki 's father , who was flying there from Detroit , via Paris . They planned to break the trip at Limoges and drive the distance in two long days on the roads . In a few weeks Kiki was going to enter the freshman class at the University of California at Santa Cruz . Although she had n't officially graduated from any of her various schools , her college boards had been good enough for Santa Cruz and she had been welcomed by that most liberal and free-spirited of universities . Her parents had carefully coordinated this summer 's trip so that they could spend time with their daughter before , as Eleanor Kavanaugh almost tearfully put it , " we lose her to higher education . " There was no question of her disappointing her father and staying on at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " Daisy , I promise you that , at Christmas , you can go visit Kiki in the United States , " Anabel told the miserable girls . " Christmas is a million years away . Why ca n't Daisy come to Santa Cruz , too ? " Kiki asked rebelliously . " She has another year at Lady Alden 's before she even takes her university examinations , " Anabel said , patiently .  | " Oh , balls , balls and bugger ! Excuse me , Anabel . I feel like a star-crossed lover or something , " said Kiki . " You do n't quite sound like one , " Anabel laughed kindly . She had taken a great liking to this unlikely creature , such a strange daughter for her old friend Eleanor , who had been , before her great automotive marriage , a conservative and well-bred American miss . That night , when Ram rapped on her door , Daisy opened it immediately . The departure of Kiki had made her realize that , in the course of their tomboy week , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of having reached . But now she felt a need , as sharp as thirst after a long day on an empty boat , to return to her lost girlhood , to become again as chaste as she had been on the Quatorze Juillet . She was calm , determined and possessed by the certainty that everything must be sacrificed to that end . Her confusions had fallen away . She could do without Ram . His protection was infinitely worse than being alone in the world . All the corners of her mind seemed clear and in focus for the first time since her father had died . Ram came in and locked the door behind him . Hurriedly , he tried to take Daisy in his arms but she retreated to the window seat . She had n't changed from the yellow cotton dress she wore at dinner and the lights in her room were all on . " Sit down , Ram . I have something to say . " " It can wait . " " No . Not another second . Ram , what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sister . You 're my brother . I wo n't do it ever again because it 's wrong and I do n't like it . " " It 's that bitch , Kiki  --  you told her , did n't you ? " he said in a voice of white revenge . " Not a word . No one knows and no one will ever know , I promise you . But it 's over . " " Daisy , you sound like some little bourgeoise ? ' it 's over ' ? how can it ever be over ? We love each other . You belong to me , little idiot , and you know it . " " I belong to no one but myself . You can do whatever you like , you can sell everything Father ever loved , you can live any way you choose to live , but I intend to stay with Anabel in Eaton Square  --  I 'm sure she 'll have me  --  and that 's the end of it . I do n't need you anymore ! " Ram came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  | arm , just below the shoulder , hurting her with his fingers . She sat as silent as a marble girl . There was enough light for him to look right into the velvet centers of her eyes and what he saw there , utter , indomitable conviction , clear and hard , maddened him . " Ram , take your hand off my arm , " she ordered him . Her words , still delivered with the calm and composure she was hanging on to desperately , only acted as goads . He fastened both his strong , bony hands on her arms and jerked her sharply to her feet , as if she were a mere beast who had to be taught a lesson in discipline . Still she stood fearlessly in his grip , looking him straight in the eye . With relentless force he pulled Daisy close to him and kissed her lips . Her mouth did n't move under his . She scarcely breathed . He appropriated her mouth , consuming it with calculated skill , and held back his anger . He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craved only a week ago . But she remained passive and detached , her lips closed and cool under his skillful mouth . He stroked her hair with a hard , possessive , demanding hand and whispered in her ear , " Daisy , Daisy , if you do n't want more than this I wo n't do anything else . . . just kissing and being close  --  I promise ... I swear . " Yet , as he clutched her to him and battered her cheeks with scorching kisses , she felt his penis rise and press dangerously against her belly . With a violent summoning of her energy Daisy flung herself away from him . " No good , Ram . I do n't trust you . I do n't want you ! Nothing of you  --  no kisses , no hugs , no more lying words . Just get out of my room . " Her voice was low , because of the others in the house , but tense with a wounding distaste . She had backed away until she reached the far wall of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunted and swollen with lust , his eyes dulled by the intensity of his need to possess her . Ram was out of control . He pressed Daisy against the wall with all of his weight , lifted her skirt with a brutal hand and ground the hard butt of his penis against her underpants . With his other hand he snatched at her breasts in a frenzy , viciously bruising the young nipples . " You would n't dare if Father were alive , you filthy coward ! " Daisy gasped . Ram hit her on the face with his open hand . She felt her teeth cut into the inside of her cheek . She felt the blood begin to flow onto her tongue . He hit her again and then again , and while she was trying , in a panic , to get the breath to scream , he put a hand over her mouth and dragged her to the bed . With every bit of force she  | possessed , Daisy was n't able to pull his hand away from her mouth during the brief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood to keep from choking , Daisy felt him rip off her underpants . He had to hit her twice again before he could wrench her legs apart with his knees and then there was the searing , rasping eternity of a nightmare as he stabbed his penis into her , again and again , with the inhumanity of a madman , dry and closed as she was . Then he was finished , and gone . Daisy lay inert , blood seeping from her mouth , so extinguished , so obliterated , that it was many minutes before the tears she longed for finally came . After the tears , painfully , resolutely , Daisy got off the bed and went to wake up Anabel . Anabel gave Daisy warm water and soft towels and stopped the bleeding and listened , holding her close , as Daisy told her the entire story , again and again , until she had finally calmed down enough to fall asleep on Anabel 's bed . Only then did Anabel give way to the sobs which were more piteous , more tormented and far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed Stash , she had failed Daisy . Ram 's crime had to remain secret , depriving her of the revenge she would have taken . She would never speak to him again  --  he was dead to her forever  --  but there was no way to bring him to justice . What was done was done  --  she cursed herself , her blindness , her assumptions , her trust . As soon as daylight appeared , Anabel telephoned to the hotel in Limoges where the Kavanaughs were spending the night on their trip south . " Eleanor , it 's Anabel . Do n't ask me any questions but do you think that Daisy could possibly get into Santa Cruz ? " " This year ? Is n't she too young ? " Eleanor Kavanaugh answered with her habitual direct approach to the fundamentals . " Age is n't the question now  --  it 's whether she could pass the exams . It 's very important , Eleanor , or I would n't let her go so soon . " " I 'm sure she could pass the college boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's of seventeen , thanks to our atrocious high-school system . Look , I 'll find out if there 's still room and where she can take the exam  --  all right ? " " Could you do it tomorrow  --  today , I mean . Do n't wait till you get home , " Anabel pleaded . " Count on me . " Eleanor had never been a person who asked unnecessary questions . " Whenever that admissions office is open in  | California I 'll telephone them  --  and then I 'll call you , and you can send them Daisy 's records . " " Bless you , Eleanor . " " Anabel , we 're old friends , remember ? I have n't forgotten . . . and do n't worry . Daisy 'll get into Santa Cruz , I guarantee it . After all , I made them take Kiki , did n't I ? Just realize , it 's not exactly Harvard . " But it is six thousand miles away from Ram , thought Anabel , as she hung up the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Daisy looked up from the catalogue of courses offered at the University of California at Santa Cruz . Kiki had been ruminating for a good half-hour as she cast a disgusted eye on her still-unpacked suitcases sitting in one corner of their dormitory room . " But that 's it ! That 's the key ! Handmade , homespun , secondhand , third-hand , stolen or bartered for  --  but above and before all else , handwoven . I mean , we do n't want to stand out like a couple of nerds , do we ? " " I thought I 'd gotten away from uniforms once I was freed from Lady Alden 's  --  do n't tell me I 've got to get back into another one here ? And anyway , why is how we dress so important ? " Daisy inquired . " I thought this place was casual . " " Daisy , you just do n't understand yet , " Kiki sighed patiently . " Once you know how to dress for a place or an event  --  once that 's figured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much time at the same school so you never had to worry , but if you 'd been to as many schools as I had , you 'd realize that you can only survive and be yourself if you blend into the surroundings . Now neither of us is exactly inconspicuous and we both want to spend the next four years sort of incognito  --  no princess for you , no Miss Grosse Pointe Automotive Heiress shit for me  --  so we 've got to get into handwoven right away , even if it itches . " " Done . Now how about deciding what courses you 're going to take ? That wo n't take care of itself , " Daisy said , waving the catalogue at her meaningfully . " There 's a course in surfing that sounds intensely interesting . Also kayak handling , bike maintenance and jazz dancing . But the only one I 'm absolutely definite about is trampoline . " " Kiki  --  you 're impossible . There 's no credit given for any of those . " " Bugger . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all  | necessary for an art major , " said Daisy smugly . " And , since we have to satisfy something called the Social Sciences requirement , let 's both take Dreaming S. Oh , hell , it says here that we have to take Western Civilization too  --  a must for Freshmen . " " I 'll sign up for anything to stay here . I think we 've landed in Camelot , " Kiki said , looking out of the window blissfully . " Look , take trail riding with me . We 've got to get some phys. ed. ? oh , blast , no credit for that . " " Give me that catalogue , " Kiki demanded . " Ah ha ! Workshop in Theater Production satisfies the Humanities requirement  --  how about that ? We get to be in a play  --  I think I 'll major in Drama . " " Good . Our education 's settled , " Daisy said in satisfaction . " Now let 's go shopping . Or should we just buy our own loom ? " Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examinations  --  Lady Alden 's ruler had not been plied without a purpose  --  and Santa Cruz had been glad to welcome the **27;290;TOOLONG student from London . Kiki and Daisy were roommates at Cowell , the first of the largely self-contained residential colleges to open in Santa Cruz which was , itself , the most beautiful baby of a great university system . It had been founded in 1965 , just two years before Daisy and Kiki entered this experimental school built on two thousand dreamingly lovely acres overlooking Monterey Bay , seventy-five miles south of San Francisco . A visitor , driving toward the university from the Victorian seaside city of Santa Cruz , grows dizzy with the rich , lazy , untouched sweep of open fields and deep forests of a former working ranch , still guarded by old fences , dotted with limestone kilns and graced by a few ancient farm buildings . The university is made up of separate residential colleges , modeled after Oxford or Cambridge in their conception of community but designed by some of the greatest modern architects in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can almost be overlooked entirely , although the students , who could be dress extras in a lumberjack movie , contrive to stay visible as they lope from class to class , bearded genial boys and gilded , if messy , girls . Daisy and Kiki romped through Santa Cruz , taking courses that always sounded easier than they turned out to be , and working much harder than they had planned to , but , in the course of it , becoming increasingly drawn into the worlds of art and the theater which opened up to them .  | Daisy discovered that her talent for drawing , which she had reserved for the sketches she made for Dani and her moments of solitude , was a substantial talent , a far greater gift than she had realized , a serious potential . She immersed herself in drawing and painting , watercolor , pastel and oil , never tempted by the abstractexpressionist mode , but rather sticking to what she did best : realistic and sensitive portraits , studies of nature , and , of course , drawings of horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest self in the theater where nothing she could do or say aroused any surprise from her peers . They were all " into self-expression " which suited Kiki very well . This was finally the " fun " she had always searched for everywhere , and at Santa Cruz she could get academic credit for it . Kiki was a spendthrift with her small delicate body . She had many love affairs , caring nothing for her Grosse Pointe indoctrination into the nature of virtue , her good name or public opinion . She cared for no opinion of her actions but her own , and her III strict code was satisfied by personal generosity and absolute sincerity . She had a talent for falling for the wrong men , but she reveled in her errors , getting out before she hurt anyone but herself . She observed , in sinful amusement , the efforts of others to try to make her feel guilty . Fun came first  --  why could n't people just admit it  --  take their fun , take their lumps and go on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mistakes ? You 'd only find a different one to make the next time anyway . Daisy and Kiki roomed together during all their years at Santa Cruz , often talking far into the night and sharing their experiences , yet Kiki , whose many antennae seemed to sprout like a network from her whimsical head , knew that there were large areas in her friend that she did n't understand . Daisy was , even in their senior year , still something of an enigma and Kiki had little patience for enigmas . " Daisy , " she suggested one day in 1971 , the winter of their senior year , " think about the clitoris . " " Before lunch ? " " Why , I ask you why , is it where it is ? All tucked away , practically invisible , impossible to find without directions that I , for one , am fed up with having to provide . " " I thought you just told them what you wanted them to do and they did it , " Daisy said , incuriously . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why should I have to give them a goddamned roadmap ? A man does n't have to show a woman where his cock is ! It 's not fair ! " " Just where do you think it should be moved to ? " Daisy inquired reasonably . " The tip of your nose ? " " I 'm not giving up sex , " Kiki answered her quickly , " but there 's a real need for reform . " " Hmmm . " Daisy waited patiently for the real purpose of this conversation . Whenever Kiki talked about the clitoris she was leading up to something . " While we 're on the subject , Daisy , there 's one thing I really do n't understand about you , " Kiki continued . " Only one ? " " Yup  --  how come you 're still a virgin ? Everyone 's talking about you  --  did you realize that ? They call you **26;319;TOOLONG . " " I know . It 's un-American . . . I 'm an embarrassment to you , are n't I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you realize that you 're going to be nineteen on your next birthday ? In a few months ? And still a virgin ? Forget un-American  --  it 's unhealthy and unwholesome . Really , Daisy  --  I 'm serious . " " I 'm waiting for Mr. Right , " Daisy said annoyingly . " Bullshit . You go square dancing with Mark Horowitz who 's having a mad thing with Janet except she hates square dancing ; you go riding with Gene , the Gay Caballero ; you go to the movies with absolutely anybody so long as it 's a mob ; you let Tim Ross buy you pizza and he 's so in love with you that he 's happy just for the honor of paying for your pepperoni ; you go into San Francisco for Chinese food with three girls , for God 's sake , and yet every one of the most attractive guys at school has been after you ! And I 'm not even counting the men you 've met when you come home with me for vacations  --  the most eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kid , including my poor brothers , those sweet assholes , and what about the men you meet when you go to Anabel 's for the summers ? I 've seen the letters they write which you do n't even bother to answer . What 's with you ? " Kiki finished , her arms akimbo under her tattered poncho , her pointed ears pink with indignation . Daisy looked at her , suddenly serious . Kiki had been sounding this note for well over two years now and evidently it really bothered her enough to make an issue over it . And when Kiki made an issue she was capable of bringing Napoleon back from Elba.  | " Okay , you 're right . I do n't want to get involved with a man , not at all . I do n't want anyone to have any power over me . I do n't want anyone to think he is entitled to any part of me . I do n't want any man to get that close . I ca n't stand it when they think they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening together  --  who the hell asked them to  --  who gave them any permission , how dare they act as if I owed them anything ? " " Hey , take it easy  --  calm down  --  we 're not talking about the same thing . You 're supposed to like getting close to a guy  --  or did n't they ever tell you when you were growing up ? Have n't I gotten through to you , ever ? " " But I do not like it  --  I do n't want to try it  --  and that 's the way it is . You should be able to accept that about me by now , " Daisy said with finality . " You 're right , I should . But I do n't . " " Well , keep trying , " Daisy advised her . Since Daisy had arrived at Santa Cruz she had been plagued by the romantic passions she inspired in various young men and , as far as she was concerned , their romantic passions gave her less sympathy for them than if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one was to be allowed to have the faintest hope of possession  --  she stamped out their feelings without the slightest remorse . She was n't responsible for them and if they wanted to be miserable because of her , let them . The minute anyone she went out with started to try to turn the neutral peck on the cheek into a larger embrace was the minute her relationship with him ended . There were always others to take his place . At almost nineteen , Daisy had consolidated her early beauty . Her spun silver-gilt hair , which she rarely cut except to have a quarter of an inch trimmed off the ends from time to time , reached almost to her waist . No matter how she tried to control it , to braid it or bunch it or tie it in neat clusters , it was impossible to do anything to keep her nape , her temples and her ears from being tickled by wisps , cowlicks and curls of shorter hair which escaped her firm hand and created a halo around her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripe peach , that she had inherited from Francesca and those generations of beautiful women of San Gimignano , and men found themselves impaled on her eyes . Eyes as large , with pupils of such a blackness as Daisy 's , were almost impossible to penetrate . . . yet the men of Santa Cruz never gave up trying . The touch of strangeness , which lent her beauty the necessary counterpoint , was her eyebrows ,  | which were so straight and determined above the mystery of her eyes . As she grew older , her full , Slavic mouth , the one feature , aside from the color of her hair , that she had inherited most noticeably from Stash , became more firmly marked . At Santa Cruz she had grown taller until she reached her full height of five feet , seven inches , but her body had not succumbed to institutional food . She was as slim and limber as ever : she rode every day in every kind of weather , and she had the firm , graceful arms , thighs , calves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been four years before but were still high and pointed . Both Daisy and Kiki wore the uniform they had settled on in their freshman year  --  jeans and handwoven tops , the jeans as battered as possible , the tops as ethnic . The two of them , known as Valensky and the Kav , were a legend on a campus where almost everyone was eccentric , because of the contrast in their personalities and their looks , to say nothing of Theseus who slept in their room and accompanied Daisy to all her classes . The only place from which he was barred was the eating commons , by demand of the other students . In spite of the intimate friendship between them , Daisy had never told Kiki about Dani , to whom she mailed , twice each week , a detailed drawing , sometimes showing a scene from her own life , sometimes a scene from Dani 's life , drawings which included those teachers and friends of Dani 's she had come to know so well . Sometimes Daisy asked herself if there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the existence of her twin sister , but , year after year , that moment had never presented itself . She still felt the power of the absolute prohibition which had been imposed by her father , that prohibition which she had been under since she was six , a prohibition she understood to be total , without knowing or questioning why it should exist . The longer it lasted , the more binding it became , and it was all the stronger for never having been discussed or explained  --  a terrifying taboo , that must be served because of consequences that were unthinkable , irrational , but entirely real . The only person left alive in the world who knew about Dani was Anabel , but Daisy never discussed Dani even with her . After Stash 's sudden death , Anabel had assured Daisy that Danielle had been provided for . Nevertheless , Daisy knew , in the deepest part of herself , that Dani was a secret she was under a compulsion to bear by herself . She had been born first  --  nothing had changed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still went to Dani . Often , when she was in the midst of some special enjoyment , she  | would imagine Dani , her double , her other self , more her child than her sister , playing in the garden or singing the simple songs she had been taught , and hot tears would fill her eyes at the realization of all her twin was missing , all the new knowledge and experience she would never have . Her only comfort was the realization that Dani was as happy as she could possibly be , that Queen Anne 's School was truly home to her and that the staff and other patients had become her family . Daisy had not , of course , been able to visit Dani from Santa Cruz , but during the long breaks at Christmas and Easter she always flew to England to see her , and every summer was spent with Anabel at La Margie so that she could be within a few hours of Dani by plane . The staff at Queen Anne 's School took photographs of the two sisters together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of thirteen years , were pinned up on a special cork board in Dani 's room . Often she pointed it out to her friends and teachers with great pride . " See Day ? See Dani ? Pretty ? " she would ask , time after time , knowing that their answer would always be , " Yes , yes , pretty Dani , pretty Day ! " During her years at college , Daisy had received letters from Ram , since all her school bills , all her travel bills and clothing bills were sent to him for payment , and her allowance checks had to come from him , too . Daisy could not tear up the letters and throw them away unread . Unfortunately money matters still gave Ram a hold on her and she could barely wait to graduate to get a job and become completely self-supporting . During 1967 and 1968 , Ram 's letters had been totally impersonal , noting only that he had paid the various bills she had sent him out of her income from her stock . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first time this happened he had written , after disposing of business , " I hope that my actions of the past wo n't be held against me for the rest of my life . I 've never stopped condemning myself for what could only have been a case of temporary insanity . " The second quarterly letter was even more upsetting . " Daisy , I 've never forgiven myself for what I did to you . I ca n't stop thinking of how much I loved you and how much I still love you . If you would only write to say you forgive me ? and that you are now able to understand that you literally drove me crazy , you would relieve me of a great burden . " This letter had struck a chord of terror into Daisy . It was as if Ram had reached out and tried to touch her . She looked around the room she shared with Kiki ,  | trembling at the thought that her only safe refuge was here , and yet even here he was able to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first letter Ram sent her in 1969 , she hoped that her lack of any answer to his last two letters would have caused him to return to simple business matters . But instead , he wrote , " I understand why you do n't feel ready to answer me yet , Daisy , but that does n't change the way I feel about you or the fact that I feel I must have , some day , a chance to gain your forgiveness in person . No matter what you think , I am still your brother and I always will be and nothing can change that  --  just as nothing can change my memories . Can you really forget the eucalyptus grove ? Have you really no feelings toward someone who loves you so much ? " The next time a letter came from Ram , and every time thereafter , Daisy dropped them , unopened , into the big trash basket in the coffee shop , unwilling to put them into the wastebasket near her desk . The arrival of one of them in her mail cubbyhole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear and loathing of Ram had grown stronger every year and his pleading words were vomitous , somehow menacing even in their humility . Long hours of introspection had permitted Daisy to understand that her premature sexual experience had been possible only because of an incompleted mourning process for her father that had catapulted her into a state in which she felt that she had lost a part of her own self , and so had fled to Ram to become whole again . She could never stop blaming him , never stop reassuring herself that it had not been her fault , but his . And yet , somehow , the guilt lingered , the guilt she knew she had no reason to feel , and she was angrily unwilling to venture into sexuality again . Daisy walled off and defended herself against sexual feelings  --  they caused pain , confusion , shame . She knew that she was n't being rational , but her emotions could not be reached by logic . Instead , she threw herself into a schedule of activities so full that her energy was consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she became a member of the crew responsible for the stage sets of the many performances put on in the various Santa Cruz University theaters . She was so eager and ready a volunteer that more and more of the work fell on her shoulders until , by fall of senior year , she was in full charge of all scenic design , and leader of a crew of scenery painters and builders called " Valensky 's Vassals " because of their devotion to their demanding chief . During her time at college Daisy created many stage sets which combined ingenuity with illusion  | in a highly professional manner . She also became familiar with all the varied crafts of stage decor : lighting , set dressing and costume design , as well as her own specialty of scenic design . She loved the stage of a theater as much as Kiki did ; Kiki , who had become such an iridescent personality , as she acted in play after play , that to most people but Daisy , she seemed a splashy , spangled creature , so colorful that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitter . But while Kiki appeared in front of an audience , Daisy 's feelings for the stage were based on the handling and working of actual materials and seeing what could be made of them . She took rich pleasure in seeing a freshly painted backdrop laid out on the grass of the sculpture garden of College 5 , and later transforming it , with furniture and props , into a startling reality , as much as she loved creating a set for a dance group , using nothing but a curtain of long ropes of Christmas tree ornaments and spotlights . Daisy did n't know what kind of job she would eventually get in the theater , but that was her ambition , and , until graduation , she planned to cram as much of stagecraft into her life as possible . Early in the fall of her senior year at college , Daisy was engrossed in sketching costumes for a futuristic version of The Tempest when an excited Kiki , shouting , " Hey , Daisy , where are you ? " burst into their room at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Listen to this , I just got a letter from Zip Simon , head of advertising at old Dad 's company and he 's coming out next week and we 're invited ! " " What does an executive of United Motors want with our humble , but admittedly lovely selves ? And by the way , you 've interrupted me . How do you think Prospero would dress on a spaceship ? " " In a spacesuit  --  just leave that alone for a sec  --  I told you ages ago that Zip promised me that the next time they shot a TV commercial anywhere near here , he 'd let us watch  --  and they 're going to do one in Monterey next week . It 's to introduce the new model of the Skyhawk . You know , the car that 's been such a secret . " " A television commercial ! Oh , really , how gross ! Stop kidding , Kiki , " Daisy said disdainfully . Students at Santa Cruz made it a fetish not to watch television except for an eccentric few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on being proud of their addiction . As far as commercials  --  all commercials  --  went , their contempt knew no bounds . Kiki , as an heiress to a vulgar Detroit fortune , was often hard-put to swallow her  | thoughts when she heard the lofty , utterly impractical ideas of her fellow students on American industry in general , and television advertising in particular . " Daisy Valensky ! " she said indignantly . " Do n't you know that Marshall McLuhan said that historians and archaeologists will one day discover that the ads of our time are the richest and most faithful daily reflections any society ever made of its entire range of activities ? " " You 're making that up ! " " I am not ! I memorized it because I 'm just so sick and tired of the way everyone goes on around here  --  talk about ivory towers  --  wait till they try to get jobs , they 'll find out . Oh , come off it , Daisy , maybe you 'd learn something from seeing them do the commercial . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how not to do things . " " Oh , you 're so fucking condescending ! You 've been at Santa Cruz so long your brain 's decayed . " " Spoken like a true daughter of noble Detroit . " " Elitist swine ! " " Capitalist pig ! " " I got to say swine first , so I won , " Kiki said , delighted at her victory in their long-playing game of insults . A week later , on historic Cannery Row in Monterey , less than an hour 's drive from Santa Cruz , the two girls approached a roped-off section of the street where a small crowd of spectators had already collected . A gigantic truck , with the word " Cinemobile " printed on its side , was parked close by . There was also a large Winnebago , and a truck carrying the new Skyhawk that was draped in heavy canvas . A vintage Skyhawk , in perfect condition , stood on the street . Kiki and Daisy edged cautiously through the crowd up to the ropes and inspected the scene of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daisy observed . " Weird , " Kiki whispered , looking at the crowd of people inside the ropes who were frozen in widely separated groups . Two of the groups were made up of conservatively dressed men in dark suits and ties muttering together in low tones . She pointed to them with knowledgeability . " Our gang 's from the agency , the other 's from the client  --  my old dad 's guys . " " Those must be the crew , " Daisy said , indicating a tangle of men and women in jeans so shabby that they would n't have looked out of  | place on campus , all of whom were drinking coffee from plastic cups and munching leisurely on doughnuts as if they were on vacation . Both girls looked with more interest at two people , isolated from everyone else who , at least , showed signs of animation . One was a tall red-haired man and the other a young , plump , severely tailored woman . " This does n't look right to me , " Kiki said snappishly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not supposed to be just standing there . " " Look , you 're not in charge here , Daisy reminded her . " Yeah , but Zip Simon is . Hey , Zip ! Over here ! " Kiki called boldly , with all the assurance of the client 's daughter , which is second I'I only to the assurance of the client 's wife . A short , bald man broke away from one of the groups in business suits and came over to escort them through the ropes which were being guarded by policemen . " Kiki , how are you , kid ? " He hugged her . " Who 's your friend ? " " Daisy Valensky . " Zip Simon sighed gloomily . " Well , gals , it looks like you 're not going to see a commercial made after all . We 've got big , big trouble . And I still ca n't believe it . North is the best damn commercial director in the business and he ca n't shoot . It 's a disaster . " " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unfortunately not  --  that we could ignore . We 've had this fucking commercial  --  sorry , Kiki  --  planned for months and now II we 've blown the location . " " What 's wrong with it ? " Kiki asked . " It 's been fucking renovated  --  that 's what . North used a location scouting service and the bastards showed us perfect photos  --  Cannery Row in its When we here we found it 'd been turned into a prime . got Design Research store , and there is n't a building left in this whole 11 lousy looks old anymore . Oh , shit ! . Sorry , Kiki . Excuse my town that language , Kiki 's friend . " " Why does it have to look old. + , Daisy ventured . " Because of the story board , " he said , as if that would tell them everything they wanted to know . " What 's a story board ? " Daisy asked . He looked at her incredulously . Such ignorance was not possible . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story board , Kiki 's friend , is a big piece of paper with cartoon figures drawn on it and balloons coming out of people 's  | mouths with words written on them . Got it ? It 's like the Bible to us simple folk in advertising . And in this story board you see an old Skyhawk convertible parked in front of a restaurant on Cannery Row forty years ago , see , and then a couple in period costume come out and drive off , and then you have another funny picture and you dissolve into the new model Skyhawk , in front of the same old place , and a couple in modern clothes walk out and drive off and voice-over you hear  --  now get this : The United Motors Skyhawk  --  still the best car you can drive ! " " I love it , " Kiki squealed . " It 's a gem  --  simple but eloquent . . . and we 're going to shoot the same scene all over the country in historic , picturesque locations  --  or , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , why ca n't you un-renovate the building  --  build a set ? " Daisy wondered . " Because we do n't have time . Tomorrow the new car has to be on a plane headed back to the factory in Detroit for the unveiling at a stockholders ' party  --  a gigantic affair  --  do n't even ask how many people are invited . And if we do n't get this shot done today , we 'll blow our first air date . Does it hurt to commit hara-kiri ? " " Oh , Zip , do n't be so hard on yourself  --  you did n't screw up the location , " Kiki said fondly . " I was going to do the hara-kiri on North , not me . " " Which one is North ? " Daisy asked curiously . Zip Simon pointed to the red-headed man . " That 's the son-of-a-bitch , and the gal with him is his producer , Bootsie Jacobs . " Forty feet away from Simon , North was speaking so quietly that no one could overhear . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , nose and throat man to look up your ass with a flashlight and tell you why you 've got a sore throat . " " That location scouting service will be out of business next week , " she said , struggling for her usual taut composure . " Palming off pictures that were two years old  --  two years ! Okay , okay , North , it was my fault for not double-checking . There 's no one you can trust ? I know it , it never fails  --  especially when you have the client and his whole mob and the agency and their shitheads all watching this little road show . Wonderful ! They outnumber us two to one , even counting all the models and hairdressers and make-up people  --  I told that lot not to set foot out of the Winnebago . It looks bad enough already . " Panic was seeping through her crisp tone . " If they 'd only let  | us keep that new Skyhawk for a couple of days , we could go to EUE 's big Burbank studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . " " You 'd better think of something to pull this one out , Bootsie , " North said angrily . " That 's your job , not mine . " Frederick Gordon North was the best director of television commercials in the United States . He knew he was . Everyone in the business knew he was . What 's more , he charged a thousand dollars a day more than any of the other top directors in the business and got it , as many days a year as he wanted to work . While the likes of Avedon , Steve Horn and Bob Giraldi all charged four to five 11 thousand dollars a day as their personal directorial fee , North got six h thousand . Even Howard Zeiff had never charged as much in the days before he became a film director , during which he was the undisputed king of commercial directors . Why were they willing to pay so much ? Why would advertising agency creative directors pay North a thousand dollars a day more than directors almost equally good ? Everyone had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the way he saw things as they would appear on film with just a little more originality , a little more visual interest than anyone else saw them . Others talked about the way he worked with actors , bringing out more than they knew they had to give . There were those who insisted it was his matchlessly innovative use of lighting , and still others spoke of the way he managed to telegraph more of a message in thirty seconds than other directors could in a full-length motion picture . The truth lay in the blood he spilled . North would do anything to make a good commercial , and he put his blood and that of everyone else he worked with on the line . He did n't secretly want to make " real " movies , like the majority of commercial directors , nor did he hanker to do the most marvelously artistic still photography . To Frederick Gordon North THE perfect art form was the television commercial , whether it was thirty seconds , sixty seconds , or even only ten seconds long , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , it was essential that his work was technically superior , but that was n't the real lure  --  the hook was , had always been , the smell and sight of blood . Daisy turned away from her inspection of North and his producer to speak to Zip Simon . " Excuse me , but do you have other problems besides the set ? " " No , just that minor detail , " Simon said bitterly . " But we ca n't  | get a set built by tomorrow , and the car leaves in the morning , even if we could work all night . " " I can get it done , " Daisy said . " Sure you could . Two minutes ago you did n't even know what a story board was , Kiki 's friend . " " My name 's Daisy Valensky and I 'm the head of Scenic Design at the University of California at Santa Cruz , " Daisy said with dignity . " I have a crew of forty top workers who will be here in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll work all night . " " Is she for real ? " Simon asked Kiki . " Of course ! They 're professionals , for God 's sake , Zip , " Kiki said quivering with the unmistakable imperiousness of her old dad 's daughter , an unfamiliar guise to Daisy , but one which Kiki knew precisely when and how to assume . " So , what the hell , Daisy , let 's talk to North . It 's worth trying ? at this point anything 's worth trying . " Zip Simon was so disgusted that he did n't mind confronting even Frederick Gordon North with this absurd idea . The shoot could n't get more fucked up than it was . North and Bootsie Jacobs watched them approach with lively suspicion . Zip Simon , Vice-President in Charge of Advertising at United Motors , did not communicate with the director of his commercials casually . And , at a moment like this , accompanied by two hippie girls , he was particularly unwelcome . " North , this is Kiki Kavanaugh , daughter of my boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah  --  Valensky . " North frowned . If there was anything worse than having a client on the set it was having the client 's daughter , and after that came the client 's daughter 's friend . ' " Hi . Sorry we do n't have time to chat today . Nice to see you . " He turned away , leaving them with the impression of supreme indifference and wrathful blue eyes . Daisy tapped him on the arm . " Mr. North , I can have this place looking any way you want it by tomorrow or sooner . " He turned and gave her a look of freezing irony . " Who let you on the set ? " " Listen , " said Simon , " this kid 's head of stage sets or something at Kiki 's college . She 's got a thousand willing nuts who want to build you a set . " " Kids ? " NQ'ith asked Daisy . " People . Good people . They like to work . " " 1 do n't care who they are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building and make it look exactly like the outside of Cannery Row fifty years ago , before eight tomorrow morning ? " He gestured in disgust at the spanking-new brick , the gleaming paint , the huge , modem windows . " We can certainly try , " Daisy said resolutely . She looked boldly at North as she spoke . He had shockingly red hair , a fox of a man with a long , pointed nose , lots of freckles and blue eyes which told her that no matter how bad this moment was , it could not possibly end in failure . He was a man of sharp , clear edges . There was nothing indistinct or rounded or even comfortable about his clever features . He turned to Bootsie Jacobs and asked calmly , " What do you think ? " " We 'd be breaking about sixteen union rules I can think of and about sixteen I do n't know about yet . Using nonunion labor would be the least of it , and that 's big trouble . Anyway , how can it work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'll kill myself , " Bootsie said grimly . " Why not let us get to work ? " Daisy said eagerly . " North , " Zip Simon said angrily , " you 've come up empty . Now here 's a chance to get something on film before I put the new Skyhawk on that plane tomorrow . I do n't care if you shoot the damn thing upside down , sideways or hanging from a tree  --  it 's up to you to do it ! That 's why we hired you . I do n't plan to go back to Detroit and have to tell my boss that the location just happened ' to be renovated and we could n't do a single thing about it . Miss Kavanaugh says that this young lady can help  --  so let her ! Unless , of course , you have a better idea . " His bald head had gone almost purple with aggravation . Bootsie glanced briefly at North . " Go call your crew , " she said to Daisy . If Zip Simon thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film , what did he think would happen to her if she could n't make this shoot happen ? She 'd begged and begged the agency to let her build a Cannery Row set at the automobile plant just to avoid trouble , but no , they had to be authentic  --  fuck authentic  --  and fly the prototype all over the country for historic streets to shoot on . What an utterly corny idea  --  but how many clients did sixty-second spots these days ? And now here was the client 's bossy daughter with her helpful suggestions  --  well , if this long shot did n't work , would n't it be partly the client 's daughter 's fault , instead of hers alone ? And who knew , with the right lighting and the right filters and a stiff breeze ... who knew ? Daisy was already headed toward the phone .  | Santa Cruz did n't have a football team , but it had one hell of a Theater Arts department . And , as Daisy knew well , they had stored backdrops and props and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real and Streetcar Named Desire and Petrified Forest . She told her people to bring everything , whether they thought they 'd need it or not , and bring it fast . She ordered them out in full strength , not just the scenery painters , carpenters and prop people , but the stage hands , the lighting crew and even the costume and make-up teams . They could all help , including Kiki . They swarmed to the location loaded with all the stuff that had been stashed away in the storeroom , including paints and tools , as thrilled to get their hands on an honest-to-God , real live television commercial as if they 'd never looked down their idealistic noses on the entire medium . An hour and a half after Daisy 's phone call , they reported to their chief ready for a night of work . The art director from the advertising agency handed over the photos of the demolished location to Daisy who snapped her orders and deployed her forces throughout the long hours before dawn . Zip Simon , the art director and Bootsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew drifted away to sleep . North coolly went to his hotel to have dinner and get a night 's rest . The catering service was on duty all night long , and by sunrise the set was ready . A Monterey which had long vanished had reappeared , if not absolutely authentic in every detail , still echoing the period and the mood of the old photos . It was jerry-built and a strong breeze might have destroyed it  --  but , somehow , it existed . It was usable . Exhausted , but too delighted with her success , and , by now , too interested in what was going on to leave , Daisy stayed throughout the shoot , understanding very little of what was happening . It was as different from a stage production as a stage production is from a basketball game . She watched the coffee-drinking rabble of yesterday become a crew such as she had never seen before , intimately connected to one another as members of a primitive clan , working together with the precision only enormous discipline can bring , more quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were all satellites of North , who controlled the set by the force of a hypnotic power , pleasure and displeasure shooting out from him as he rehearsed the actors to the constant accompaniment of asides to a girl  | who sat on a box seemingly chained to an enormous stopwatch which she wore around her neck . " We have four seconds here , " he said to her . " How many have I used ? " " Three and a half . " " Yell when I 've got four . " As Daisy watched him , she realized that this man in his early thirties , tall , lean and tense , was a battered lion tamer of diehard toughness . He would n't be daunted by a cage of mixed rattlesnakes , porcupines and polar bears , to say nothing of lions . No matter what problems circled , prowling and growling , around him , North never put down his whip and chair , invisible though they might be , and once he began directing , every person on the set was convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was looking through the camera . The client group and the agency group stood at a respectful distance , glancing constantly at their watches , but drinking in the electric tension of the curses , the frenzy , the lightning flashes of temperament , the freely opened veins . They were in show biz , they thought , not realizing that as far as North was concerned , this had nothing to do with show biz and everything to do with advertising . The crew combined alertness and stillness in equal combinations , as people do who are sure of their skills and aware of when they are needed and when not . The technical jargon Daisy heard was strange to her in spite of her knowledge of stagecraft , and many of North 's directions to the actors sounded odd . " Four seconds , " Daisy muttered to Kiki , " what can you do in four seconds ? " " Sell cars , " said Kiki smugly . Over and over and over she heard North say , " Stand by . . . and ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out almost unbearably . Many times it seemed to her that everything had gone perfectly , but he never seemed satisfied until , abruptly , he was . He coaxed , he warned , he encouraged , he grew taller , he grew shorter , he got violently angry , he became suddenly gentle and calm , he screamed for quiet in a terrifying voice and , seconds later , looking through the lens and talking to his cameraman , he was as loose as if he had been alone on the street . Once he caught her eye with a raking glance , unexpected and startling . Pointing to the couple in modern dress about to get into the new Skyhawk , he said to them , " Now the intention here is that you 're  | going to take her home and give her a zatch  --  I have n't been out myself since 1965 , but am I wrong about the intention here ? " Odd direction or not , the actors immediately grew into a couple in love when before they had only been a couple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of the pressure to send the new Skyhawk back to Detroit . The auto carrier that would take the car to the cargo plane was delayed until the last possible second before the automobile , again hidden in its canvas covering , was carried away . Only then did North call a break . Daisy expected that after lunch the set would become more relaxed , since they had the use of the vintage Skyhawk for as long as they needed it , but the tense time pressure was as strict as before . Time , on a commercial shoot , is always the enemy  --  there is never enough of it , and both North and Bootsie had to be back in New York for a production meeting with another client on the following afternoon . Finally North said quietly , " Right , it 's a wrap , " and the technicians began to dismantle their equipment , the models vanished into the Winnebago with their attendants , and the large lights , cameras , sound equipment and other tools of the trade were quickly stowed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circus and Daisy felt sad as time turned back into an everyday beat , time which had been counted in seconds and half-seconds , all day long . " Hey , they 're leaving without saying goodbye , " Kiki said with astonishment . " No , they 're coming over here , " Daisy said . " How could they not say thank you ? " North and Bootsie , almost running , approached the two girls . " Be sure to strike the set and make certain everything is back exactly as it was , " North ordered . " Uh  --  sure , " said Daisy . " Sorry , but we have a plane to catch , " Bootsie said rapidly . " You were really great  --  Daisy , you 'd make a terrific production assistant if you ever want a job . " " Thanks  --  but no thanks , " Daisy answered . " Come on , Boot , we have n't got time to talk , " North snapped impatiently . " So long , ladies . " He took Bootsie by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they drove off Bootsie Jacobs said , " You could have been a little nicer to them  --  they really helped , for Christ 's sake ! "  | " They would n't have been necessary if you 'd done your job , " North answered absently . No one , but no one impresses him unless they get in the way of his blasted parade , Bootsie thought wrathfully , and then ... watch out ! Four months later , in February of 1971 , with graduation only four months away , Daisy received a letter from Anabel . Daisy dearest , Is n't it frightful ! I 'm in such a state of shock at the news . Honestly , I know just how the Minister of Aviation felt when he spoke in the House last week ? " never in my wildest dreams or nightmares did I dream it was as bad as all this . " I can imagine how you feel , too ? Rolls-Royce in receivership ! It simply does not seem possible  --  only three months ago the government said that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they saw the books ! ! I 've been wiped out , of course , financial idiot that I am  --  but I assume that Ram got your money out ages ago . I hate to say it but when he told me to sell I thought he was too young to change Stash 's investments , but it 's no good even thinking that way . Do you know what he put your money into ? I detest asking a question like that but , darling Daisy , there 's a reason . Although your father and I never married , I considered myself responsible for Danielle 's upkeep and , from the income of the stock he left me , I 've been paying her bills since he died . When the stock became worthless I went to see Ram . Daisy , I know what you 're thinking but it was the only possible thing for me to do . I had to tell him ... after all , she 's his half-sister too . It was almost impossible to convince him that she existed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Stash had never seen fit to bother him with Dani he must not have wanted him to know about her ... he even said that as far as he was concerned she simply was n't real . She was no responsibility of his . And he 's rolling in money .. . simply rolling ! He categorically rejected contributing a shilling to her school bills . Forgive me for telling him , Daisy , but I was sure he 'd help , fool that I was . I should have known how he 'd react , but I had to try . Anyway , I 'm going to have to retrench severely . I 'm selling Eaton Square and moving permanently to La Maree . With the few investments I still have and the sale of my paintings and the Faberge animals there should be enough of a nest egg so that I can invest it in  | something safe and live off it for the resi of my life . Even a modest income would be enough , particularly if some of the friends who used to visit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , darling , next summer I 'll find out . The problem is n't what 's to become of me  --  of course I 'll manage one way or another  --  but what will happen to Danielle ? The school has sent in their quarterly bill for what amounts to almost five thousand dollars in American money and I find that I simply ca n't put my hands on that sum . I just ca n't believe it ! It 's no more than I used to spend on underclothes without thinking twice . How our vanities catch up with us . But , oh , it was glorious while it lasted . Never forget that . Now , to business . Can you take over some  --  in fact most  --  of the Queen Anne 's bill ? I do hope that Ram invested wisely for you ! But enough of this . I 've never thought for so long or written so much about money in my life . It makes me fairly lightheaded  --  how can people stand to be bankers ? And to think that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Eaton Square ! I find I do n't mind selling this house as much as I thought I would  --  the idea of living all year in La Margie is so appealing . You 'll be coming at Easter , of course , my pet , wo n't you ? Perhaps all the apple trees will be in bloom as they were last year . . . but that was an early spring . My dearest love always . Je t'embrace tres fort ! Anabel Daisy read the letter over three times before it made complete sense to her . She had n't bothered to look at a daily newspaper in weeks , and this was the first she had heard of the bankruptcy of the Rolls-Royce Company . Ram had never , in the letters she had read before she started throwing them away , again suggested that she sell her stock , but she had always assumed that she possessed more or less what the stock had been worth right after her father 's death , when it had amounted to roughly ten million dollars . Daisy realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where her money was . Even though she had cut off communication with Ram , she had remained in his power financially . What had he said in the letters she had found too distasteful to open ? Daisy went to her desk and wrote Ram a brief note asking for a complete statement of her financial position , and then wrote a much longer letter to Anabel saying how unhappy she was about the changes Anabel was going to have to make in her life , but assuring  | her that she must not worry about Danielle 's future expenses . From now on , Daisy wrote , she would be responsible for her sister . It was out of the question that Anabel should beggar herself for Dani  --  her generosity had been already enormous . She 'd had no idea where the money for Dani 's bills was coming from or she would have taken them over long ago . And of course she understood why Anabel had told Ram . As for La Margie at Easter , she would n't dream of missing it . She posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was already a little late for a dress rehearsal of Hamlet performed entirely in mime and jazz dancing . All the parts were being played by females , and Elsinore had been relocated to the island of Lesbos . Daisy felt a persistent uneasiness as she waited for Ram 's reply , but she dismissed it and immersed herself in work . Five days later she received a cablegram . HAVE WRITTEN THREE TIMES IN LAST YEAR FOR PERMISSION TO SELL YOUR STOCK . HAD NO REPLY SO ASSUMED YOU INSISTED ON HOLDING . UNFORTUNATELY , COMPANY IS NOW NATIONALIZED . STOCK WORTHLESS UNLESS GOVERNMENT REIMBURSES BUT DOUBTFUL SINCE YOU HELD COMMON STOCK NOT PREFERRED . HAVE ADVANCED FROM PERSONAL FUNDS MONIES FOR ALL YOUR EXPENSES FOR PAST FOURTEEN MONTHS SINCE ROLLS INCOME NOT SUFFICIENT . INTEND TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT YOU . CONSIDER IT APPROPRIATE IN VIEW OF OUR RELATIONSHIP . RAM . Daisy dropped the cable on the floor and ran to the communal bathroom . She felt as if someone had come upon her in her sleep and hit her head with tremendous blows . She reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomit . She hugged the chill bowl as if it were the last refuge on earth . After the final dry heaves had stopped she remained kneeling in the bathroom , mercifully empty of students , clutching the friendly porcelain . She felt that there was still an unexpelled mass in the back of her throat , a solid ball of disgust and panic , like some monstrous embryo clinging to her breathing passage as it might cling to a womb . Her aching stomach muscles tried to clench again but failed to dislodge the mass . There was nothing left , not even bile , to throw up . Her sense of life being safe and good had evaporated in the lethal gas of Ram 's message . She felt as if she had fallen far down into one of those dark places , unbearably sad , filled with danger and threat and fear of the unknown , the places she had  | lived in for so long after her mother had disappeared , after Dani had been taken from her , when her father had died  --  all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the news she had just received . All the victories she had won , all her stubborn refusals to be controlled , felt hollow and tawdry now that she knew Ram had been giving her everything she thought she had paid for with her own money . She was in his debt now , God help her , and her stock was worthless . Why had n't he simply sold without her permission ? As her trustee he could have done so and he must have known what was happening to Rolls-Royce . Was it possible that he had let this happen just to put her where she was now ? She would never know , Daisy realized , and it really did n't matter . She had to manage somehow . With this thought her fighting spirit began to return . She stood up , her flesh and bones so sore that they seemed to be in conflict , and went to one of a row of washbasins to brush her teeth and splash her face with cold water . She met her eyes in the mirror and willed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the bathroom and went to her room to think . There were four more months until graduation and the chance to get a job . That meant , Daisy told herself , that she just would n't graduate  --  she did n't have the luxury of time . She had one asset and one only , the lapis egg which still sat in its box in the bottom of her chest of drawers , the egg Masha had given to her as she lay dying six years before , the egg Masha said that her father had given her mother when she found out she was pregnant . The time to sell the egg had come  --  it would buy at least a year , perhaps a little more , for Danielle . A job . She knew enough about the theater to know that she stood almost no chance of finding employment except in an experimental playhouse which would pay almost nothing . The only time in the last four years that anyone had mentioned any other form of employment was last fall , when that woman commercial producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good production assistant . Whatever that was , precisely , it had to pay more than the theater . Get the name of the commercial company from Kiki or that nice fat man , Zip Simon , who worked for Mr. Kavanaugh , call what's-her-name , and ask for a job . What do I have to lose ? thought Daisy . The worst they can say is no . And maybe they 'll say yes . Even if they never did say thanks .  | The catfood people called again , " Arnie Greene , business manager of Frederick Gordon North 's commercial studio , said hopefully . " And ? " North asked . " This time it 's for six spots , thirty seconds each , big , big budget . Easy to do  --  no way we could n't make lots of very pretty money . " " How many times have I told you , Arnie ? No catfood ! There 's no budget big enough to make me shoot that stuff . I ca n't stand the way it looks . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bid on their new business . " " You can tell them to stuff it . I saw the story board they 're going with  --  spaghetti , cheeseburgers and strawberry shortcake in drippingly edible closeups with a voice track saying that if you join Weight Watchers you can enjoy your favorite treats and still break the habit of eating fattening foods  --  and those sadistic bastards are going to run the spots at night , after dinner , just when fridge orgy time starts . I 'm not against it on humanitarian grounds  --  I think the concept 's basically bad and while I can choose , I choose not to do Weight Watchers . " Arnie Greene sighed mournfully . He was in charge of all financial transactions at the studio , and he turned down more work than North could possibly turn out without expanding his operation from its present size , but he still hated to send a potential client packing . " Where 's Daisy ? " he asked , looking around the conference room . " She 's out nailing down the Empire State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through for the week  --  it 's Friday , remember ? " North answered . " Why do you want her ? " " She 's got the bills from the catering service . She took them home last night to check them , said we were being overcharged.  | Wo n't let me pay them until she found out where . Honestly , North , I think she 's paranoid  --  she always says they 're ripping us off on Jewish fish . I told her we have to give the clients smoked salmon for lunch ? they come all the way in from Chicago , they expect smoked salmon . Four years now and she 's still checking the bills . " " It keeps her off the streets , " North said curtly . It irritated him , for no rational reason , to think that Daisy still had the determination and willingness to spend her free time worrying about bills after the exhausting days she put in on the job ... it irritated him almost as much as the weekends she frequently managed to spend in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bootsie Jacobs to hire a production assistant who turned out to be some kind of White Russian princess with revoltingly classy friends . If she were n't so fucking good at her work , he 'd never have given her Bootsie 's job when it became available . But then , who would have thought Bootsie had it in her to get knocked up ? And want to keep the brat ? Of course she had been married ten years , so he guessed she was entitled . " North , " Arnie said , handing over two checks , " sign these please and just do n't bother to look at them . " North signed the two alimony checks grimly . Arnie went through the **27;347;TOOLONG every month . " Can you tell me why I married the two most beautiful models in New York and why they both turned out to be raving neurotics in less than a year and why I have to support them ? " " Why ask me , do I look like a shrink ? " " You look so much like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be his brother  --  probably are for all I know . " " Well  --  what 'd he say ? " " I did n't wait around to find out . " " Why not ? " " He asked too many personal questions . " " Yeah , that would do it . " Frederick Gordon North was known simply as North because he would n't permit the use of his first two names , foisted on him by family-proud parents from old and comfortable Connecticut families , and Fred , Freddy , Rick , Ricky , and Gordy had all been ruled out as well . A timid movement at Yale to dub him Flash  --  which would have suited him best  --  had only lasted one day . His parents still called him Frederick , but he was North even to his brothers and sisters , who ,  | in any case , only had occasion to use the name at Christmas and Thanksgiving since they were an unclannish family , of which he was the most unclannish member . I He had been a loner almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been persuaded to perform only a minimum of the obligatory extracurricular activities . The first thing he ever set his solitary heart on belonging to was the Yale Graduate School of Drama . His goal was clear to him  --  he wanted to direct : Shakespeare , O'Neill , Ibsen , maybe even a little Tennessee Williams . But he had set his course without understanding his own inner pace . The mounting of a theatrical production takes many months , and North 's viciously concentrated attention span demanded quicker results . Soon after graduation he met a third-rate veteran commercial cameraman who was willing to try him out as director on a commercial with a budget so low that any profit that could be wrung out of it would have to come from using a nonunion crew and director , all at bargain-basement rates . That first commercial , a thirty-second local spot for a chain of discount clothing stores , caught North as firmly as if it had been a chance to work with Lord Olivier at the Old Vic . He had found his metier , a medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart and his inner eye . Now that he knew what he really wanted to do , remorselessly North jettisoned his baggage of the world 's greatest playwrights and headed straight for Madison Avenue where he spent four years learning all the technical ropes at the knee of Steve Elliot , the dean of commercial directors , a violin-playing , bulldozer-driving , Renaissance man who , with his brother Mike , had been among the first commercial directors to get their cherished cameraman 's cards back in the early 1950s . The Elliot brothers had founded Elliot , Unger and Elliot , a firm which later became EUE/ Screen Gems , then and now the giant of the commercial-making industry . At twenty-five , North went out on his own , living for the first six months on money he 'd saved , hustling every contact he 'd made at EUE , until a few small accounts came his way . By the time he reached the top he was only thirty . When Daisy went to work for him , she was barely nineteen and he was thirty-two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equally astonishing charm , which he saved for the rare times he had unavoidable social contact with his most important clients , and the frequent times he had deliberate carnal contact with a long and lovely  | parade of women , two of whom he had had the bad judgment to marry . He was no more of a joiner in a marriage than he had been when his father had tried to get him to become a Boy Scout , but , fortunately , he had avoided having children , as Arnie Greene frequently reminded him when it came time to sign the alimony checks . " At least there 's no child support , you should knock on wood . " Daisy , once she was assured that there would be no further problems with Mr. Jones , supervisor of the Deck of the Empire State Building , headed downtown to the SoHo apartment she shared with Kiki . Something about the arrival of spring had put her in a reminiscent mood that even the subway ride could n't modulate . She found it hard to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bootsie Jacobs had answered her letter immediately . They not only needed another production assistant , they were desperate for one . When Daisy found out what the job entailed she realized that their desperation was permanent and well-deserved , since few people lasted more than two months in the incredibly demanding and underpaid job . However , she had had no choice . She was paid one hundred seventy-five dollars a week for the nonunion job at which she worked at least twelve hours a day , but it was enough to live on and still save money for Danielle 's bills , provided that she lived on next to nothing , a style of life she had perfected until it had almost become an art form . Of course , without the thirty thousand dollars that she had received for the lapis lazuli Faberge egg she could never have met the bills until she developed another source of income aside from her job . Thank God , thought Daisy , for kids on ponies . She remembered how it had started . Jock Middleton , who had played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anabel asking him to keep an eye on Daisy in New York . He 'd invited her out for a weekend with his family in Far Hills , a horse-crazed part of New Jersey which rightfully belongs in the Bluegrass country . Daisy had packed her riding clothes , just in case they had a mount for her , and spent a happy Saturday riding with a flock of Middleton grandchildren . At an elaborate dinner party that night , Mrs. Middleton had introduced her to everyone as Princess Daisy Valensky . On Sunday , - when Daisy had made a sketch of the oldest Middleton  | grandson on his pony , as a thank-you present , she signed it as she had always signed her work , with a simple " Daisy . " A few weeks later she 'd had a letter from Mrs. Middleton . The sketch had been so much admired that she wondered if Princess Daisy would consider doing one of a neighbor 's ten-year-old-daughter , Penny Davis ? Mrs. Davis was willing to pay five hundred dollars for a sketch , or six hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was embarrassed to mention money to Prince Stash Valensky 's daughter , but Mrs. Davis had insisted . Mrs. Middleton blushed to make such a commercial proposition , but her neighbor had just not given her a second 's peace . Daisy had only to say no and she would n't be bothered again . Daisy rushed to the phone to accept , wishing she could suggest doing it in oil and charging another hundred dollars . No , better not  --  she did n't have the money to buy oils and canvas . Any well-trained , competent artist should be able to draw a horse , but there are special abilities involved in understanding the movements , the stance , the anatomical differences and the variations of color necessary to make one horse look entirely different from another . Daisy had been drawing and riding horses most of her life . As for the children , she 'd drawn them too , by the thousands , during all those years of making drawings for Dani , and she 'd taken advanced courses in portraiture at Santa Cruz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pronounced knack which was to give her equestrian portraits a lively quality of sympathy and immediacy . When she arrived at the Davises , a larger and more luxurious Monticello , Daisy was introduced to Penny Davis , who was already dressed in her best riding clothes . Daisy took one look at the child 's rigidly set face and apprehensive eyes . " I thought we 'd all have lunch together before you get started , Princess Valensky , " Mrs. Davis said . " And you must be ready for a Bloody Mary after the trip out . " " That 's awfully thoughtful , but what I 'd really like to do first is ride with Penny , " Daisy answered . She was n't about to work with a model who not only was miserably shy but did n't want to have her portrait painted under any circumstances . " But what about lunch ? " " We 'll manage . Penny , why do n't you put on some jeans and show me the stable ? " When the girl returned , looking a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is there a MacDonald 's near here ? " Penny looked around quickly to see if her mother could hear . Out of the corner of her mouth , she confided , " It 's only five miles if you ride across country . But I 'm not allowed to go there . " " But I am . And you 're my guest . Let 's just git ! " The little girl 's eyes lit up as she glanced with surprise at Daisy . " Are you really a princess ? " " Sure . But to you I 'm Daisy . " " Do princesses like MacDonald 's ? " " Kings like MacDonald 's . Come on , Penny , I 'm having a Big Mac fit . " Penny led the way over fields and fences . Within ten minutes and double Big Macs , Daisy discovered that Penny thought portraits were dumb . Worse than that , who would want to have a picture of herself with braces on hanging around for the rest of her life ? " Penny , I promise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , if you want , I 'll paint you the way you 're going to look when they come off  --  with a gorgeous smile . But think of it this way : an equestrian portrait is as much a portrait of the horse as it is of the person . You 'll have to sell Pinto in a year or two , the way you 're growing , and now you 'll always have a picture of her to remember her by . Hey , could you eat another of these  --  I 'm having one . Good ? maybe I can get them to give us extra sauce . " " They 're all having trout in aspic for lunch at home . " " Ugh , ugh , ugh ! Wonder what 's for dinner ? " " Roast duck  --  it 's going to be very fancy  --  she 's invited practically everyone we know . " " Oh , well , " said Daisy philosophically . " Duck 's better than trout . " That afternoon , as the young girl posed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin down the natural , spontaneous gestures and characteristic expressions of Penny Davis . She also took many pictures with the Polaroid she 'd borrowed from the studio . They would be used as visual aids for the watercolor she planned to complete at home . She blessed the classes in anatomy she 'd taken as she carefully sketched Penny 's hands holding the reins , and further blessed the natural limitations which surrounded an equestrian portrait , since they ruled out too great a variety of pose or attitude . She sketched lightly , without any tightness or stiffness , not trying for perfection , but for a feeling of the child in relationship to her pony . On Sunday , as Daisy traveled back from the Davises ' estate ,  | driven home by their chauffeur , she reflected on the fact that Mrs. Davis , like Mrs. Middleton , had ceremoniously and importantly introduced her as Princess Daisy Valensky at the big , formal dinner party last night . After her four years as Valensky at Santa Cruz , Daisy had almost forgotten that she had a title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country , anyway . Since painting kids on ponies was probably the most commercial way in which she could use her talents , Daisy ground her teeth and resolved to milk the princess routine for every penny it was worth . When she had finished the watercolor of Penny Davis , she signed it in clear , careful lettering , " Princess Daisy Valensky . " It meant six hundred and fifty dollars for Danielle . Slowly , through word of mouth , after the Middleton sketch and Davis commission , Daisy got requests to paint other kids on ponies . Her prices rose steadily . Now , not quite four years later , Daisy was able to ask and get two thousand , five hundred dollars for a watercolor . These commissions , which had started to come just before the Faberge money ran out , represented the difference between being able to support Danielle and being forced to try to get Ram to pay , any way she could . Daisy had never told Anabel where her money came from , because she did n't want her to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolls-Royce . Nor did Daisy tell anyone at the studio why she spent so many weekends flying to Upperville , Virginia ; Unionville , Pennsylvania ; and estates near Keeneland , Kentucky . She knew they considered her to be a fullfledged member of the social , horsy set , but as long as she did her job , she did n't see that it was any business of theirs what she did with her own time . Of course , Kiki , who saw her working night after night to finish the watercolors , knew about her work , and in certain circles a portrait of one 's child on a pony by Princess Daisy Valensky was quickly becoming a status symbol . When Daisy had had to leave Santa Cruz to get a job , she finally told Kiki about Danielle . There was no other possible way to explain her leaving college a mere four months before graduation except by telling the truth  --  or part of it . She remembered the scene as she had told the strange , sad story , the variety of expressions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , astonishment , sympathy , indignation and wonder replacing each other in quick succession . Daisy had anticipated the two questions she knew her friend would eventually ask when the reality of what Daisy was telling her finally struck home .  | " But why wo n't Ram support Danielle ? " " It 's a way to get at me . We had a serious and permanent quarrel over a family matter , and nothing can change that or make us friends . Believe me , it 's final . He does n't consider Dani his sister anyway ? he 's never even met her . It 's out of the question . " " Then why wo n't you let me help ? " Kiki asked , warned by Daisy 's tone not to pry into the nature of the family quarrel . " I knew you 'd get around to that . First of all , I have to do it alone because it 's going to be a permanent thing  --  even you , generous as you are , ca n't take on someone else 's relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud to borrow a couple of hundred dollars just until I get my first paycheck . " She had n't expected Kiki 's last reaction . " I 'm leaving school , too  --  we 'll go together , " she proclaimed , when Daisy had finally managed to convince her that she would n't let Kiki support Dani on a regular basis . " Never . No way . That 's out ! I refuse to be the reason why you do n't get a diploma from somewhere . Your mother 'd never forgive me . But I 'll rent someplace that 's big enough for the two of us and the minute you graduate I 'll be waiting for you with open arms and half the rent bill  --  retroactive . It 's only four months . Do we have a deal ? " " Christ , you 're bossy , " Kiki complained . " Can I pay for the furniture ? At least ? " " Half of it . " " I assume it 'll be Salvation Army . " " Unless you can get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who redecorates once a year must have leftovers . The idea is that we 'll accept donations of things , just like any other deserving organization , but we wo n't take money  --  because that gives people a right to say what we do . Got it ? " " Can we take money on Christmas and birthdays ? " Kiki asked wistfully . " Definitely . And we never go out with anyone who does n't pay for dinner . Dutch treat is out . Together , we 'll bring back the fifties . " As Daisy climbed up the steps to their third-floor apartment in a shabby building on the corner of Prince and Greene Streets she sniffed the pervasive smell of fresh baking in the air . Cinnamon rolls today , she decided . SoHo , only fifteen years before , had been declared the city 's number-one commercial slum . Now it was the  | artists where the current dress code called for paint-encrusted overalls , whether , as Kiki remarked disdainfully , you had ever held a paintbrush or not . But then Kiki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right way to dress in any given locale . Thanks to the timely death of her grandmother , she was rich enough in her own right to become the owner , producer , and permanent leading lady of her very own off-off-off Broadway theater , The Hash House . She was , in fact , the recognized Ethel Barrymore  --  Sarah Bernhardt of SoHo , and she dressed to suit whatever play she was currently mounting . Her latest production , The Lament of the Pale Purple Faggot was keeping the theater comfortably full , especially on weekends when the uptowners came down to see what was going on in playland . Casting herself as the protagonist 's only female confidante , Kiki had been drifting around for the last few weeks in an arrangement of a lavender leotard , pink tights , purple suede boots and a mauve feather boa , all of which suited her admirably . Daisy unlocked the door and looked around . The apartment was empty . That meant that Kiki was probably still at the theater and Theseus was with her . He consented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiki 's feet or following her around the theater . He was only totally happy when Daisy came home , but it was impossible to have a lurcher on a set . The caterer 's table would have been denuded before the first sleepy grip asked for a cheese Danish in the morning . Kiki and Daisy 's place in SoHo was n't one of those enormous lofts that many artists had carved out of former cast-iron , palazzostyled , industrial buildings . It was an apartment on a human scale in a shabby building that boasted a small art gallery on the first floor . But it was large : big enough to contain a rambling living room , three bedrooms , a studio for Daisy , a fairly large kitchen and two bathrooms which unfortunately seemed to still have their original plumbing . The style could only be called free-floating . At various times their apartment contained bits and pieces from the sets of Kiki 's plays ; odds and ends from the junk dealers of the neighborhood , and much fine furniture from Grosse Pointe . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent-enough beds and the mural with which one of their friends had been inspired to decorate a living-room wall : a pastoral scene featuring Theseus engaging in various criminal acts in a series of farmyards . Neither Daisy nor Kiki had the instincts of a homemaker , and when they were n't invited out to eat  --  a rare  | situation  --  they bought something from a local delicatessen for dinner . When they bothered about breakfast , they snatched it at a little street stand right around the corner which sold a doughnut and coffee for fifty-five cents , and , mysteriously , featured fresh coconut . Daisy flopped down with a sigh of relief on the latest couch , brown satin and agreeably overstuffed , that had recently arrived from Kiki 's mother . Every time she sent them a new shipment they promptly sold their old furniture . Eleanor Kavanaugh found it strange that they 'd been able to absorb such quantities of objects , but she said , sniffing in disapproval , she supposed Kiki needed them for that theater . . . . Thank heaven Grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her money . Although , of course , if she had lived , there would n't have been  --  oh , never mind , just do n't tell her all the ghastly details . " She 's actually thrilled , " Kiki declared . " I know that she boasts about me at the country club  --  she calls me a patroness of the arts . " Daisy roused herself from her comfortable place on the couch long enough to take off her baseball jacket . She 'd bought it right after going to work as a production assistant for North . She 'd appeared on that first morning in her newest jeans , freshly pressed , her best beige cashmere turtleneck sweater and a checked hacking jacket that had been made for her in London years before . " Oh no ! " hissed Bootsie , when she saw Daisy arrive . " What 's wrong ? " Daisy asked , alarmed . " Christ  --  do you have to look so much like old money ? " " But it 's my oldest jacket . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green stuff . And besides doing your job , you have to spend as much time as possible getting friendly with the crew so that they 'll tell you everything you need to know , something I positively do not have the time to do . You 're going to be pestering them with questions from morning to night and you 're going to be dependent on their good will . They 're the sweetest guys in the world if they think you need help , but no way do you look like a working girl who needs a job . That jacket says that you ride , you 've ridden for years , you have better riding clothes somewhere else , and you 're probably still using them . And they 're hip to that . So get rid of it ! " " But you look very put together and expensive , " Daisy objected . " I 'm the producer , kiddo . I can wear whatever I want . " Now that Daisy had Bootsie 's job , which paid four hundred dollars a week , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It  | reminded her of those first frantic , panicked months when , just as Bootsie predicted , she floundered around from grip to gaffer , from the sound man to the assistant cameraman , from the hair stylist to the set designer , from the prop man to the script supervisor , asking what now she realized must have been incredibly stupid questions , and writing down all the answers in a little notebook . Her jacket had won her friends by its mere existence , developed dialogues , created innumerable opportunities to join in mutual nostalgia for the lost team . It had made her one of the boys at a time when she desperately needed to be one of them . She looked at her watch . In one hour she would be picked up for dinner at La Grenouille , followed by the opening of the new Hal Prince musical . Her hostess , Mrs. Hamilton Short , lived on a large estate in Middleburg , and she had three children , none of whom Daisy had been asked to paint . . . yet . Cinderella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to her room to start the transformation from working stiff to princess . Or rather , from working stiff to working stiff , if the truth were known . Ram was thirty . He lived in a perfect house on Hill Street , only a step away from Berkeley Square , a house decorated by David Hicks in severe bachelor sumptuousness . He was a member of White 's Club , far and away the most exclusive and difficult to enter of British gentlemen 's clubs , and he was a member of Mark 's Club , that private restaurant which is the haunt of the most languid and most privileged of the young elite of London . His suits , which cost nine hundred dollars each , were made at H. Huntsman and Sons , the best tailor in England , as were all his riding clothes . He was counted as one of the best shots in the British Isles and owned a pair of shotguns , made to his measurements , from James Purdey and Sons , a firm that had existed in the time of George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed , at fifteen thousand dollars the pair , and they were , Ram thought , well worth waiting for . His shoes and boots came , of course , from Lobb 's and cost from two hundred and fifty-five dollars a pair upward , depending on the style and the leather . He collected rare books in a major way and avant-garde sculpture in a minor way . He wore white silk pajamas piped in a sober burgundy , heavy silk dressing gowns and shirts made from the finest Sea Island cotton , all made to order at Turnbull and Asser . He considered Sulka vulgar . He never left the house without his umbrella from Swaine , Adeney ,  | Brigg and Sons . It was made of black silk and the handle and shaft were carved out of a single piece of exceptional hickory . He drew the line at a hat  --  perhaps in ten years , but not now , except for fishing , riding and yachting , and his dark hair was cut in the privacy of one of the ancient wooden rooms at Trumper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except on Sunday . Ram 's name appeared with frequency in those sugary columns about society written by " Jennifer " for Harper 's and Queen magazine . Jennifer invariably described him as " the notably handsome and totally charming Prince George Edward Woodhill Valensky . " He also often was mentioned in Nigel Dempster 's purposefully bitchy column in the Daily Mail , where he was sometimes called " the last , dare we hope , of the White Russians , " although Ram had made it a point not to join the Monarchist League run by the Marquess of Bristol . He had no interest in a group he considered fundamentally frivolous , nor did he care to rub elbows with archdukes in exile , who , even if they might be cousins , would almost surely prove to be needy . His business sense had led him to multiply his fortune many times . Ram was a full partner in an investment trust , Lion Management , Ltd. , which had had impressive success in supervising the placement of large amounts of money from the pension funds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments . If he had wanted to spend a weekend at one of the country estates which still , in spite of taxes , exist in Great Britain , Ram had but to pick up a phone and call any one of dozens of the young lordlings he had known at Eton . An equal number of the most spirited and desirable young beauties of 1975 would have invited him to their beds with enthusiasm , for Ram was one of that small group of rich and wellborn young men whose name appeared on every list of the Most Eligible Bachelors in England . However , his status in British society had nothing to do with his money or his title . It rested on the one indispensable thing he had never even bothered to covet during his youth  --  land . And the land came through his mother 's family , the family he had barely considered as he grew up . His mother was the only child of an untitled family , the Woodhills of Woodhill Manor , in Devon ; quiet squires who had lived in one spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with pastoral certainty , at all parvenus , whether they were recently created earls whose titles did n't go back further than the eighteenth century , or merely merchant princes whose businesses had made England great in the Victorian era . As far  | as the Woodhills were concerned , they were all " fearfully recent " people . The important thing about Valensky , everyone agreed , was that , when his grandfather died , he had inherited Woodhill Manor and the nine hundred acres of farmland that went with it . It was the ownership of this small piece of England that put Ram on the same lists as H.R.H. Prince Michael of Kent ; Nicholas Soames , grandson of Sir Winston Churchill ; the Marquess of Blandford , who would one day become the twelfth Duke of Marlborough ; and Harry Somerset , heir to the Duke of Beaufort . Without Woodhill Manor and its pleasant fields , Ram 's fortune and title would have always been just a bit foreign , but with Woodhill backing them up with the reassuring solidity of county status , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the City every day and worked hard . He returned home on foot , considering the walk as necessary exercise , changed for dinner , went to the entertainment of that particular evening , drank little , came home at a reasonable hour and went to bed . He rarely picked up his phone to arrange a country weekend , nor did he often ask for admittance to any young woman 's bed . When he did it , he never asked a second time , not wishing to encourage bothersome attachments or raise false hopes . If he had had a cat , he would have kicked it . When he reached his thirtieth birthday , Ram decided he must consider the idea of marriage to someone suitable . Not immediately but eventually . Looking around White 's one night , when he 'd taken a partner there for dinner , he 'd noticed how different the club 's atmosphere was from the busy , cheerful lunchtime scene . Only a handful of tables were occupied , many of them by solitary , older men who were far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely decent . Ram did n't care for that fate . He began to consider the available crop of possible wives in the intense , humorless , practical manner that fit his outward demeanor . Ram knew perfectly well that eligible as he was , he was not really liked . He did n't know why and he considered it of little importance . Some men spent their time being liked , others had better things to do . He was , however , highly and widely respected , and that , he felt , was the important thing , the major thing . When Daisy 's picture appeared in Vogue or any of the other publications , English , French and American , which kept an occasional eye on her horsy weekend parties , Ram looked at them with bitter disapproval . He felt absolute disgust at her job with North ,  | working in a field he considered low , common and contemptible . Her social life seemed , to him , to be devoid of discrimination . Whenever any of the people he knew questioned him about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a half-sister , with no English blood , and that he knew nothing and cared less about her private life . If it were not for the dreams about Daisy , dreams of love ; hopeless , endless , devouring , destroying , never diminishing love , that tormented him ceaselessly , week after week , year after year , he might almost have managed to believe what he told his acquaintances . How he wished she were dead !  | Conference rooms are , almost by definition , designed to impress , but few of them were as explicit , Daisy thought , as that of the Frederick Gordon North Studio . It always amused her to look around and appreciate its purposefully spare and unornamented severity , its deliberately unemphatic and austere whitewashed brick walls and bare wooden floors lacquered in shining black . No one of any sensitivity could fail to be susceptible to the astringent luxury of the chrome Knoll chairs covered in pewter suede and the ascetic sweep of the huge , bare , oval conference table of white marble . From his place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushbuttons that signaled to the projectionist in the booth outside , telling him when to darken the room , when to lower the screen from the ceiling and when to roll film , a device which rarely failed to make even the most sophisticated clients sit up and pay attention . The conference room was on the top floor of a three-story building which had once been an abandoned music school in the East 80s , between First and Second avenues . Seven years ago North had bought it and converted it into one of the few privately owned commercial studios in the city . The first and second floors formed one huge sound stage which could be arranged in a thousand ways . Only the top floor was used for offices . North also owned his own cameras , lights and equipment . Since the vast majority of commercial directors had to include the cost of rental of studio space and equipment when they bid on a job  --  and most advertising agencies asked for at least three bids on each assignment they award  --  North was able to underbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a larger profit than his competitors despite his high fee . Now , in the fall of 1975 , six months after the hairspray commercial had been shot , an important meeting was being held in the conference room . Before the average commercial job , North usually met only with Daisy and Arnie Greene , but today he had  | insisted that all of his key employees be present for the first planning session of the Coca-Cola Christmas commercial . By now Daisy knew the people gathered around the table so well that they felt almost like extensions of herself . There was Hubie Troy , the free-lance scenic designer with whom North worked so often that he might just as well have been on staff ; Daisy 's two young male production assistants , both recent Princeton graduates who would learn , or try to learn the business , and then go on to something which paid better ; Alix Updike , her assistant for wardrobe and casting , a tall , quietly dressed and reserved girl , who used to be the lingerie editor at Glamour ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Ivy League , unpressed duck trousers and splotched tennis sweater which was unraveling in six places . Daisy was sure he 'd plucked out the threads himself . Wingo was a Harvard graduate , the son of one top cameraman and the nephew of another . Had it not been for these family connections he would n't have been able to enter the cameraman 's union , as tightly controlled as any medieval guild . He 'd served as an assistant cameraman to his uncle for the necessary five years before getting his own union card . North infinitely preferred working with young men because they were receptive to even the wildest of his innovative ideas , and although , as the owner of his own business , he was entitled to operate a camera himself , without a union card , he disliked being responsible for all technical considerations in the heat of filming , while he had to concentrate on the actors and an overview of the entire set . Daisy 's eyes rested with affection on Arnie Greene , the business manager , who still found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life for EUE with its four hundred employees he was now part of a " boutique " operation like North 's . However , many of the top directors in the business preferred to work in small , compact shops , and although Daisy knew that Arnie hated the term " boutique , " a word that was totally inappropriate for what was a mini-movie studio , it was used by the entire industry . Finally , Daisy considered the flamboyantly elegant figure of Nick-the-Greek , North 's full time " rep " who worked on commission getting new business . Nick was , to Daisy 's knowledge , the only rep in the city who had found his way into the advertising business via a spitball . In the mid-1960s , when the big advertising agencies were each fielding a baseball team , and competing ferociously against each  | other , a copy writer at Doyle , Dane and Bernbach had heard of a Puerto Rican high-school kid from the Barrio who was the best pitcher north of 125th Street . He 'd given him a token job at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Manuel took one shrewd look at the agency business and liked it a lot better than any possible future in Spanish Harlem . The tall , flashingly handsome teenager baptized himself Nick-the-Greek and here he was now , earning over one hundred thousand dollars a year , wearing sevenhundred-dollar suits and drifting over to " 21 " for lunch every day , catching top jobs as easily as a lizard catches flies on his tongue . He could handle clients as carefully as any mahout ever handled a royal elephant during a lion hunt in India . Now , just as North was about to call them all to order , Nick took the floor . " Companeros all  --  I have here the results of a new Gallup poll , " he said , taking out a clipping from the New York Times and brandishing it at them . " Can it , Nick , " Arnie begged , knowing that when Nick-theGreek got started , time got wasted . " Wait ! You do n't understand . This concerns all of us , Arnie . Those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wasp Resignation  --  come to order , por favor , and pay close attention . This poll concerns honesty and ethics in various professions as perceived by a cross section of the American people . " " That has nothing to do with Coke , Nick , " said North , impatiently . " So why do n't you just go away and hustle ? Have n't you got some hungry , rich , potentially profitable client to take to lunch ? Vamanos  --  we 've got work to do . " " Not until I give you good tidings , " said Nick , who , like all reps , made it a point of honor to be far more grandiose than the working stiffs for whom they labored . The reps of New York , a mafia of superslick , ultra-fashionable salesmen , consider themselves to be to the actual commercial makers as Russian wolfhounds are to a pack of mongrels . " Here it is  --  clergymen , you 'll be thrilled to hear , rate highest in the poll . Doctors and engineers come next . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating is given to something called " advertising practitioners . " That means us , companeros , boys and girls included . Forty-three percent of the whole , fucking American public gave us a very low , repeat , very low rating for , and I quote , honesty and ethical standards . ' The only people they rate lower than us are car  | salesmen ! We even rate lower than state officeholders ! Do n't any of you guys feel we should protest ? March on Washington , take out ads to say how clean , upstanding , patriotic and plain , down-home good we are ? I do n't think we should sit here and let them dump on us . Have you people no pride ? Nor moral indignation ? Do n't you give at least a little , tiny shit ? This ca n't be allowed to go unchallenged . " His faultless teeth gleamed in his swarthy face , as he stood there , mockingly listening to the burst of hooting , catcalls and derisive whistles that filled the room . " Nick , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's never been to Athens , you 'll have to muster the indignation for all the rest of us . Out ! The headwaiters of the world are waiting eagerly for you , " North said firmly . As the rep left , Arnie Greene said aggrievedly , " If doctors rate so high , how come there are so many malpractice suits ? " " Everybody knows the Gallup poll is fixed . " For a second North 's wily grin appeared . " Forget it Arnie . Now that Mr. Wonderful has boogied off , let 's talk advertising for a change . And I 'm warning you , anyone who is n't taking notes will regret it . This is a ninety-second commercial , and the story board makes a Max Rhinehardt production look like batshit . Not only that , Luke Hammerstein is going for humor , and they 're not even going to show the product  --  which makes the whole thing different from what anyone else is doing . " " Not show the product ? " Arnie Greene asked , in such astonishment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mention it for one whole incredible minute and a half ! Then , at the very end , we 'll hear Helen Hayes saying , No matter how your family spent the night before Christmas , Coca-Cola wishes you wonderful holidays all year round . " " Did you say humor ? " Daisy asked . " Yup  --  Luke calls this the Flip Side of Christmas , ' and he is seriously nervous about his idea . Luke talked Coke out of going with a big montage of Christmas dinners all over America , very mixed ethnic , your standard Mid-American big-yawn time , but Luke managed to sell them this  --  have n't I always said he was the best creative director in the world ? " " Yeah  --  but the two of you do n't usually work together . You fight all the time , " Daisy murmured , still dubious . " True . " North gave her a disapproving look for her interruption . " Luke is my close friend , but he has the conviction , unfortunately shared by most agency people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the concept begins and ends with the agency . As far as they 're concerned , all a director does is bring the concept to life . I say it 's both the concept and the way I make it make it work  --  my taste level , if you 'll excuse the expression . That 's why we fight . I want my share of the credit , Luke wants his share , and unfortunately together they add up to a hell of a lot more than a hundred percent . However , this commercial is a clear-cut case . He needs my help . And he knows it ! With the story board they 've got here it 's either going to be a mild giggle or a fucking classic . " The sharp planes and angles of North 's face , his nose which ended so abruptly , even his freckles , all seemed to quiver with eagerness . North could hear the roar of the crowd under the circus tent , he was getting ready for the moment when he 'd go into the cage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like this before , many times , but rarely had she seen him so excited by a challenge . " May one ask what the Flip Side of Christmas ' is ? " asked Wingo , in his usual cheeky drawl . " It 's the shit that really goes down  --  thirty seconds backstage at a grade-school Nativity play , thirty seconds of a family of eight trying to get into a car meant for five small people , loaded with bulky presents , skis , what-have-you , all on their way to Christmas dinner at grandmother 's , and last , thirty seconds of the sheer , hideous trauma of decorating the goddamned tree and everything that can go wrong  --  beginning to get the picture ? And soft , soft sell  --  Coke does n't want to be hustling during the CBS Christmas special , so that , Arnie , is why we do n't show the product . " " Is any of this location , " asked Hubie , who was already sketching rapidly on the pad he always carried . " No , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hubie , you 've got not one , not two , but three  --  count them  --  three-walled sets to build . Nobody 's seen three-walled sets used in a year , so get lost , you know what you have to do  --  here 's a Xerox of the story board . I want everything middle-class but nice , and authentic , so fucking authentic you can smell the Christmas tree , smell the kids backstage , even smell that car with too many people in it . " As Hubie left , North fixed what was left of his audience with a I ' stern eye and continued . " Daisy , you and Alix pay attention . Casting is of major , major importance in this  --  you know what the Coke commercials usually look like  --  everybody totally all-American , too many teeth , so much blond hair you could repopulate half of Scandinavia with the models  --  I do n't want that . This is going to he  | different  --  we re not selling Coke to make you popular or happy , we re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and telling everybody that maybe they should just laugh at it . So do n't cast all-American Prom Queen . Most people get depressed enough at Christmas just seeing too much gorgeousness . For the kid 's Nativityplay scene , I do n't want little Jamie from Ivory soap or little Rusty from Crest toothpaste , I want real kids , nearsighted , fat , pimply , snot-nosed  --  cast sideways , not straight ahead , cast bent , as bent as you can get . Do n't give me those looks . You think I do n't know how much harder it 's going to make the job ? Shit , ladies , if a kid ca n't sit f1 still , concentrate and follow directions , it 's home-movie time . That 's a chance I 'm willing to take because this has to look like a real Christmas play in a real place  --  not TV-commercial heaven . " " North , " Daisy asked suspiciously , " is this all in the story board  --  you 're sure the client wants bent kids ? Coke always goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me one small favor ? Stop trying to second-guess me , " he snapped , thoroughly annoyed . " This story board calls for a dozen kids , good mix , three black , five white , all colors of hair , two Oriental and two Chicano . On the other thirty-second scenes you need nine people for the tree-trimming episode and eight for the family in the car , plus a dog , a really big , awful-looking one  --  a crummy , slobbery , hairy dog . . . not a cute one . . . also a baby , nine months old . Get me the quietest babies in the world  --  remember we ca n't keep them under lights for long , so we may need a dozen in reserve . Check it out . But bring me just one familiar face and I 'll tear your heads off ! This is going to be the Dickens Christmas Carol of Christmas commercials . " Arnie Greene rolled his eyes to heaven . He knew what could happen when North got really excited about a job . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not show business , they might go over budget to get just exactly what he wanted and he would n't be satisfied with a millimeter less . He did n't know what the words " good enough " meant . Well , he owned the business and this year they 'd net enough so he was entitled to play a little . " Wingo , " North turned to the young cameraman . " There 're three Hollywood studios in town now shooting movies . You may have trouble getting the crew we want , so get off your ass and start phoning . Tell ' em it 's four days work , starting ten days from today . " " Four days  --  since when ca n't we do ninety seconds in three ? " Wingo objected .  | " With kids and dogs and babies ? We 'll run over  --  it 's inevitable . And if you say three days they might have other jobs on the fourth ? how 'd you like to lose your crew before you finish ? " " The thought , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are you still here ? " " Excellent question , " he said cheerfully , rising from his seat . " It all sounds easier than it 's going to be , North , but at least Luke did n't ask us for the Robert Altman look ' ? not , of course , that you could n't give it to him . " Before Wingo reached the door , North caught him with a last goad . " Wingo , young man , I hear from my secretaries that that lady of yours named Maureen has been calling you every ten minutes . Why do n't you just throw it into her and get her off our back ? " " Sorry , but no time for social chatter this morning , boss , " said Wingo , closing the door quietly behind him . " That boy will go far , " North said in satisfaction . " I like his fucking nerve . " Sure you do , Daisy thought balefully , in a man . But let a woman try it and you would n't merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart out and eat it for breakfast . " Daisy , " North said , " tomorrow , we go to the agency for a meeting with Luke and his people . Do you think you could try to look like a lady , or at least a female ? " He shot an unmistakable glance of disapproval at Daisy 's habitual working costume . " I 'll make every effort , but I ca n't guarantee it  --  not on what you pay me , " Daisy retorted . It was a never failing source of irritation that although she was the " producer " of the commercials , and in charge of coordinating every detail of every shoot , her job was nonunion and she was paid less for working more hours than anyone else in the studio . North ignored her remark , as he always did , refusing to acknowledge the fact that Daisy 's clothes made good sense . Soon after she had learned her trade she discovered that since someone was always looking for her to solve a problem , her jeans and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crew . She had worked out an outfit that had three virtues : it was cheap , practical and highly visible . In cold weather she wore U.S. Navy , World War II , ordinary seaman 's pants with their complicated set of thirteen buttons and their sturdy fabric . In summer she wore white Navy bellbottoms . To go with these basic trousers she had a dozen boys ' Rugby jerseys in the boldest stripes and brightest colors she could find . In the huge , grubby confused studio she always wore  | tennis shoes and thick white socks , and braided her hair into one fat pigtail that fell over one shoulder , but at least it stayed out of her face . If it 's ladylike you want , North , she thought , I 'll give you ladylike till your fillings fall out . The meeting ended while Daisy was planning her look for tomorrow  --  the 1934 Mainbocher suit , she thought , high heels , a tight chignon and gloves , you rotten bastard . No matter how she railed at North in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he unpacked one fresh idea after another from the inexhaustible stock he seemed to possess , closely folded in his mind . His highest praise after a complicated , difficult commercial had been completed was to say to her , " It 'll probably work , " yet , for these three words , like a horsewoman trying out for the Olympic jumping team , she was game to attempt any fence , no matter how high . She could understand , she told herself in an attempt at fairness , why so many models insisted on telling her how devastatingly , divinely attractive her boss was , but then they did n't know him as she did . How could they begin to imagine the hardness of the man , the lack of warm humanity ? His brilliance gleamed , but with a cold light . Nevertheless Daisy was unable to keep herself from trying to please him in her dedication to her job . As she had mastered her skills over the past years she took a craftsman 's pleasure in her work , in each full , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without her , would never have come together . She gloried in the flashes of inspiration that enabled her to solve the inevitable emergencies that plagued any shoot . With all modesty , she knew she was very , very good at what she did . Damn him , if only , just once , he 'd admit it ! It is not often that the creative people who make television commercials have a chance to break the rules . Normally they are limited , almost entirely , to working in a world in which moldy grout can ruin a woman 's life , while at the same time , perfectly white teeth can guarantee her love and happiness ; a world in which her husband 's morning is destroyed by a weak cup of coffee yet his virility can be validated by the brand of beer he drinks ; they inhabit a cosmos in which thick , bouncy hair is life 's dearest treasure and moist underarms are a constantly lurking menace ; a territory in which best friends exist only to make critical remarks , and the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a carefree , athletic existence or being haunted by relentless anxiety . It 's a threatening  | world in which the only real hope is the right kind of life insurance or a new set of steel-belted radials ; a world of unending physical effort in which perfectly nice women are given life sentences in which they must produce immaculate floors , pristine toilet bowls , and even impeccable laundry ; a world in which the people who depend on iron supplements to give them vitality barely look old enough to vote , in which the best filled medicine cabinet is certain to lack that one particular preparation which will make pain and head colds not just bearable but almost enjoyable . When this world is n't scary , it is frustratingly filled with too-healthy people having impossibly delightful fun in far away places , all thanks to an after-shave lotion or the right eye make-up . In advertising land it 's quite all right to use obscenity to sell cigarette lighters  --  they could n't dare mean anything dirty by " Flick my Bic , " could they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navels do n't exist , and a pregnant woman may never seem to have the desire for physical contact with a man , not even her husband . There is even a regulation preventing a woman from sucking her own forefinger on camera . Singing cats can sell cat food better than any other commercial in history and creative advertising men write their copy in a cold sweat of fear and angst , not knowing whether a new idea will make them a hero or get them fired . With ten-second commercials becoming more and more popular , with research showing that viewers do n't remember commercials that contain more than one single message , and with prime seconds on television costing hundreds of thousands of dollars , the opportunity to make expensive mistakes continues to multiply and the pressure to play it safe grows . Luke Hammerstein had persuaded his bosses to go with his intuition on the Coca-Cola Christmas commercial , and intuition could mean disaster . If anyone had ever told Luke Hammerstein , when he was a wild , brilliant graduate of the wild , brilliant School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one day he would routinely send his most original ideas off to be tested in front of a carefully chosen target audience at Audience Survey , Inc. , before he elected to use them or not , he would have sneered in outrage . But that was in the early 1960s when boy wonders in Edwardian clothes were grabbed up by the big agencies and started as assistant art directors when they were just out of school , the free-spending , innovative , **61;376;TOOLONG days of commercials . Many of the other boy wonders did n't survive into the tighter-money , harder-sell days of the 1970s , but just as Luke had  | seen the change in the spirit of commercials coming long before it happened , he had traded in the poetically dandified elaborations of his attire for severely tailored suits with matching vests , started to wear solid blue shirts with starched white collars and French cuffs , begun to sport a stickpin in his dark , plain tie , and grown the perfectly trimmed Van Dyke beard which lent the final touch of authority to his aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced the graces he had cultivated in his early days as he progressed , in an amazing ten years , from assistant art director to art director to art supervisor and finally to creative director , with fifty people working under him , and eighty million dollars of annual billing under his supervision . Luke Hammerstein , only son of a conservative German-Jewish investment-banking family , was a superstar on Madison Avenue , even if his mother  --  who thought all advertising unnecessary and common  --  would never believe it . Luke knew , from the beginning , that if an art director is ever going to advance in the agency business he has to be more than an art director ; he has to also be a source of original ideas , a copy writer , a salesman and an expert on media and research . Luke was in the center of the creative revolution when the power in the agencies passed from the people who created the words to the people who created the pictures . He had risen to a position of enormous power . But no power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chance to do a Coca-Cola commercial without having to sell the product left Luke light-headed with the sheer freedom of it , and as antsy as he 'd ever been . Luke was almost never present at the shoot of one of his ordinary commercials , but during the four long days it took to finish the Christmas commercial , he showed up at North 's studio every day , accompanied by the account supervisor , the assistant account supervisor , the copy writer and the art director , all of whom had been involved in the working out of Luke 's commercial before he ever truly believed he could get the client to go for it . His agency group arrived no earlier than 10:45 A. M. although the cast and crew 's call was for 8:00 . Wise to the ways of commercial makers , Luke knew that the first take could n't possibly take place before 11:00 . In the words of one advertising immortal discussing the first three hours of every working day , " We shoot a commercial the way we used to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . it 's two guys carrying things on their backs , like over the Burma Road ... you pull and you push . "  | The clients , the men from Coke , were there in force , too . Sometimes as few as six , invariably , just before lunch , as many as twelve . Although Daisy had been involved in dozens of shoots where the agency and client contingents  --  the " hungry worriers " as North called them  --  outnumbered the commercial makers , this time the cast , crew and observers were so numerous that the big studio was strained as it had never been strained before . Looking back , after it was all over , Daisy could n't be sure what had been , for her , the high point of the whole enterprise . Was it her canny method of casting kids who looked " real " but were actually professional models ? She and Alix had spent four days searching out those unfortunate child models who 'd had to stop work because of broken limbs , the early onset of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , growing out of their cuteness  --  even a month could do it  --  and just plain discipline difficulties , kids who were considered troublemakers . She winnowed out a gang of authentic misfits , none of whom could have sold a single box of cereal , no matter how sugar coated . These rejects provided enough difficulty on the set to convince North that they were normal , but without their foundation of professional training , the Nativity scene could never have been shot , not just in the agonizing day and a half it eventually took , but not in a week or perhaps not in a month . Or was the best part , she asked herself , the satisfaction she had in casting Theseus as the dog in the car scene ? Since North had wanted a difficult dog , Daisy reasoned there was no reason why she should n't make the money which would otherwise have gone to a recognized dog model . It came to her share of two months rent and , as usual , Dani 's expenses had left her with no money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , with strict instructions . " Keep him on the leash at all times until North signals for him . That 'll be when the family 's finally all stuffed into the car  --  one of the kids is going to whine , We forgot my dog . ' Then let him go . " North inspected Theseus superciliously . " Where did you find that beast , Daisy ? I 've never seen anything like him before . " " Not to worry , he comes highly recommended . " " But I wanted a more annoying dog , something really shaggy . Something sloppier , " he complained . " This dog is guaranteed to be annoying , " Daisy assured him . Since she had carefully hidden tiny bits of raw sirloin in various pockets of the clothes worn by all the actors in the scene , clothes she had chosen for the fact that they had pockets that buttoned , she had  | total confidence in Theseus 's performance . With his hunting blood at boil he 'd be all over those unfortunate people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let her down . Take after take , he bounded into the packed car and wormed his way around the eight " family " members , poking his nose into their most private places , wagging his tail in their outraged faces and amorously pawing all over them in an unceremonious delirium of confusion and quest . All around was the smell of meat  --  but where was it ? At the end of each take , Kiki dashed in with the leash to lead him out , slipping him a piece of meat from a Baggie full of beef tidbits which Daisy had given her , so that Theseus would n't get too frustrated  --  never enough to satisfy him but just enough to keep his appetite at its height . By the middle of the day North said in admiration , " That 's the worst behaved mutt I 've ever seen in my life . He 's driving them up the wall  --  perfect , Alix , perfect ! " Naturally , thought Daisy , he does n't even give me credit for casting my own dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model playing the mother of the family developed a violent allergy to Theseus and could n't stop sneezing . " Write it in , " he told the hovering copy writer . And for the next twenty-nine takes , between constant sneezes , the woman had to say , " You know that dog makes me sneeze ! " and the impossible teenage son had to reply , scornfully , " Oh , Mom ! It 's just psychosomatic ! " There was no question that Theseus was the star of the thirty seconds which everyone called " Over the Hill to Granny 's Pad . " By the last day of the shoot , when they reached the treedecorating scene , a childish spirit of fun had overtaken even the hungry worriers . They started to suggest lines and situations which were n't on the story board . " This is getting like the Yiddish Art Theater , " North told them . " Fellows , we have enough problems right here  --  nothing is going to go right , I promise you , so could I bother you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing did go right . It took forty-five takes before the gaffers could manage to get the tree lights to blow all the fuses inside the set without having them blow all the lights outside the set as well , plunging the studio into total darkness each time . Long after the Coca-Cola commercial had won a Clio , the commercial world 's Oscar ; long after it had won the New York Art  | Director 's Club coveted annual award ; long after it had been exhibited at commercial film festivals all over the world and brought back awards from Venice and Cork and Tokyo and Paris , Kiki had no doubts at all about the high point of those four days . What were the awards compared to the moment she had met Luke Hammerstein ? Kiki had felt so sorry for poor Theseus , after he 'd spent all day sniffing for hidden meat , that as soon as the scene was declared a wrap , she 'd let him off the leash . " Excuse me , dog handler , " Luke said to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the caterer 's table , creating consternation and famine ? " " Do n't worry about that food , " Kiki said . " If you 're hungry , I 'll take you out to dinner . If you 're not hungry , we can go to my place and just talk . " Luke Hammerstein was sinewy and of medium height . He had green eyes which were both audacious and dreamy , insolent and kind . His eyelids were melancholy and his manner detached . " Jesus , " said Luke . " Is that a pass ? " " You 'd be wise to consider it as such . I do n't just kid around , " Kiki said , with open admiration in her umber eyes . " But what about the dog ? " " Forget him  --  I was just babysitting him for a friend . Coming ? " Kiki was still the diabolic tatterdemalion , the elfin gypsy she had been when she and Daisy met eight years ago , but now she was far more aggressive and self-assured . Her excesses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she avoided the serious moment as if even one might turn her into a pillar of salt . In all her unsheltered years she could n't remember meeting a man like Luke . She reached up and stroked his pointed , silky beard . What possibilities , what fantasies , what lubricious potentials it presented ! " Well . . . " Luke hesitated . All day long he 'd seen Kiki on the set until she 'd become part of the scenery , and suddenly , she had transformed herself into a peremptory female who seemed to have a specific intention regarding him and no problem about showing it . In fact , in the black pants tucked into the black boots and the severe black shirt Kiki had decided were right for her background role today , she seemed to him to be an apprentice highwayman , or rather , highwaywoman . Every poll he 'd read recently indicated that when women made the first approach it had a desirably erotic effect on men . " Do I have a choice ? " he wondered . " Not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " I guess I do n't at that . . . anyway , what do I have to lose ? " " Nothing you want to keep , " Kiki assured him with her low laugh which was as fresh and aphrodisiac as a puff of spring air . At a distance Daisy was trying to decide who was doing the most damage , Theseus or Kiki . From the look on Luke Hammerstein 's face , she decided it was too late to save him ... anyway , he was a grown man and should be able to look out for himself . . . but she still might salvage enough from the caterer 's table to feed the crew who had worked long over their normal quitting hour and would be expecting their dinner , as well as their extra money . She collared Theseus with one practiced gesture , pulling him from his perch on top of the platters of roast beef , corned beef and ham . " Christ , Daisy , do n't you have the sense to keep your hands off that wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Theseus , my own precious , " Daisy said , with a hand signal she 'd taught him ten years ago , " go give your Uncle North a nice big kiss . " Daisy had been invited to Middleburg , to Hamilton and Topsy Short 's , for the weekend following the Coca-Cola shoot . As she considered what to pack she realized how important it could be  --  must be  --  to her . Daisy needed money badly . The Horse People had been scattered all over the world the past summer and she had n't had a commission for a kid on a pony in months . Mrs. Short had hinted , in that dangling way in which certain rich , prospective patrons torment artists , that if the small sketch she had asked Daisy to do of her eldest daughter was satisfactory , she would consider commissioning an oil painting of all three of her children as a birthday present for her husband . That , Daisy calculated , would be at least a six-thousanddollar job , although it would take several months to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no doubt about the utter necessity for earning some money . The quarterly payment for Danielle 's care was due in a month . The prices at Queen Anne 's School had gone up gradually , over the years , more than keeping up with the sums Daisy made through her painting as well as whatever was left over from her salary . Danielle 's continual care now cost Daisy almost twenty-three thousand dollars a year and she had n't been able to afford to fly to England to see her twin in the past eight months . Although she still faithfully made drawings to send Dani , sometimes she had so much work that she had to substitute one of the postcards she bought at a store in  | SoHo called " Untitled Art Postcards , " postcards she knew Dani would like : the original illustrations from Alice in Wonderland , Odilon Redon butterflies , the carousel figure of an ostrich from the Philadelphia Museum of Art , three Edward Lear cartoons of Foss the Cat from Lear 's Nonsense Songs and Stories , the strange fairy painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babies . And now , just when she needed advice , Kiki was n't exactly being helpful . Ever since she 'd met Luke Hammerstein yesterday she 'd been acting as if she were a moon-struck female satyr . " Kiki , " she 'd objected , " I saw you coming on to Luke Hammerstein yesterday  --  you just ca n't behave like that . . . it is n't ladylike . " " My dear Daisy , " Kiki answered loftily . " It worked and that 's what counts . And , in any case , your language shows the deplorable effect of association with that person you call Nick-the-Greek , if I may say so . " " What does that mean , worked ' ? " said Daisy suspiciously . " Where did the two of you go last night ? " " Out to dinner . " Kiki 's face was a circle of merriment and secret humor . " And ? " " Princess Valensky , the fact that at the advanced age of almost twenty-four you only have had two unimportant love affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive men hardly makes you a person to consult on romantic matters . I 'll answer your question when there is more to report . " During her years in New York , Daisy had , by dint of persuading herself that it was necessary to overcome her feelings about sexual involvement , allowed a few of her most persistent suitors to make love to her . She found that she could respond to them physically but not emotionally , and the relationships had not been important or lasting . " I 've had three love affairs , " Daisy said angrily . " And one was with your own cousin . " " But did I describe the gentlemen properly ? " Kiki demanded . " You did n't say that they were all very attractive . " " I stand corrected . They were , but not my type . Now Luke Hammerstein on the other hand ... " " Spare me . Kiki , come on . Help me out . I 've only got an hour to pack . The car 's coming to take me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves promptly at seven . Now , what do you think I should  | wear on Saturday night ? It 's that usual nonsense of Do n't bother to dress , dear , because we 're only having sixty for dinner . ' In Middleburg they think dressing for dinner is pretentious ' so they compromise ? you know , silk blouses , long tweedy skirts , granny 's pearls , everything fabulously expensive and just the right amount of dowdiness . You know I do n't have that sort of drag  --  I would n't even if I could afford it , " she said in a worried tone . When she had first started spending weekends with the Horse People , Daisy had been forced to carve out a unique style for herself . She could n't possibly buy fashionable dinner clothes so she became an old-clothes aficionado , avoiding the antique-clothing boutiques with their exquisite garments which only a Bette Midler or a Streisand could afford ; avoiding the almost-new shops which were crammed with last year 's couture clothes , already dated ; and avoiding as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garment in good condition . Her buys all came from London jumble sales in church halls that she found time to go to each time she visited Dani . There she specialized in unearthing English and French couture originals , preferably over forty years old , clothes that had been made in the great dressmaking decades of the twenties and thirties . She researched them after she brought them back in triumph , for nothing she owned had cost over thirty-five dollars . Daisy led Kiki into the third bedroom of their apartment in which she kept her nonworking clothes hanging on a horizontal pipe which crossed one end of the room . The two girls stood and contemplated the garments that hung there . " It would n't be so hard if you only had regular clothes , like other people , " Kiki sighed . " Ah . . . that . . . how right you are . But it 's simply too expensive and too dull , although I admit it would make life easier , " Daisy replied . " The Vionnet ? " Kiki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fingering the pale violet satin dress , cut on the bias and dating from 1926 . " What do you think about the striped Lucien Lelong ? " " To be honest , I 've never really liked it on you . Your essential wood nymphishness is not enhanced by zebra stripes , no matter how well done . How about the black velvet Chanel suit ? It may be forty years old , but it looks as if it had been born yesterday , " Kiki answered .  | " It 's not the right time of year for black velvet , especially in bluegrass country . " " Wait , wait , I see those Dove tea pajamas  --  you said they were around 1925 ? Just look , Daisy , cyclamen brocade and green satin with a black satin jacket  --  it 's a smash ! " " They 're Locust Valley maybe or Saratoga , but definitely not Middleburg . " " So that lets out the white satin pajama suit from Revillon too ? " " Afraid so . Oh , rot ! " Kiki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's treasures  --  they were all too long for her , but she itched after them . " Ah ha ! " Daisy pounced . " How could I have forgotten ? Schiaparelli to the rescue , as usual . " Triumphantly she held up an ensemble from the late 1930s when the daring Schiaparelli was doing clothes which were four decades ahead of their time . There was a jacket in lettuce green tweed touched with sequins at the lapels , worn with a pair of corduroy pants in a darker shade of green . " Just right , do n't you think ? " " It 's heaven  --  really a fuck-you number , as in fuck you , Mrs. Short , I know it 's tweed and I know it 's sequins and I know you did n't think they can be worn together , but now you do . " " In a nutshell . I really need this commission , so it 's important to look as if I did n't . " " Then you 'd better take my fake emeralds again . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequins ! "  | Of all the potential differences in human tastes , habits , interest and predilections , among the strongest is that which divides people who care about horses from people who do n't . People can love cats or dogs and not feel as if they exist on an entirely different plane from those who are indifferent to these animals , but Horse People not only do not care to understand people who do n't give a damn about horses , but the mere idea that such people exist  --  and are the vast majority  --  makes them wonder about the future of the human race . Horse People may be heads of state or professionally unemployed in their ordinary lives , but horses are their passion , as Jerusalem was the passion of a soldier in some ancient Crusade . The cult of the horse as their idol is as central to their lives as cocaine is to some and applause is to others . Perhaps not all of them know that the earliest work of art known to archaeology is a two-and-a-half-inch sculpture of a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a masterpiece of supple grace which is thirty-two thousand years old  --  but this fact would seem only fitting and right to any Horse Person . It is only normal that the Cro-Magnon people of the Ice Age appreciated the horse twenty-five thousand years before the dawn of our civilization  --  normal and to be expected , since they believe that the horse is nature 's finest achievement , not excluding man . " Stupid , dumb , moronic beast ! " Patrick Shannon told his horse quietly . He did n't want to be overheard . He was taking a private riding lesson in an outdoor ring at a stable in Peapack , New Jersey , only an hour and fifteen minutes from Manhattan . During the last month his chauffeur had driven him out to the school every night , right after he finished his heavy schedule of work as president and chief operating officer of Supracorp , a two-billion-dollar corporation . This had meant giving up all social life and the after-work squash games at the University Club that were one of the only chances he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had now  | abandoned , in favor of this enraging , ridiculous , humiliating pursuit of something at which he would never be really good . At thirty-eight , Patrick Shannon was a natural athlete who had a way with a ball , any ball . . . but growing up in an orphan asylum had given him lots of ability with balls and none , none whatsoever with horses . He hated the things ! They drooled and they snorted and they huffed , they turned their heads and tried to nip at his legs with their ugly , big teeth , they reared like silly girls if they saw something they did n't like , they walked sideways when they were supposed to go forward , they stopped to eat the grass when you had n't pulled on the reins and would n't start when you kicked them . They smelled good  --  that was all he would say for them . Horseshit was the best smelling shit he 'd ever come across , oh , he 'd grant them that . The trail of events that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . He had set his heart on acquiring for Supracorp another real-estate company , one solely owned by Hamilton Short . Ham Short had suggested that Shannon come next month to spend a weekend in Middleburg , Virginia , while the wooing of his business was going on . Short , assuming that Shannon rode , had spoken of " a little hacking about . " Shannon , after committing himself to the weekend , had realized too late that he had n't said he did n't ride . He did n't know just how crazy Horse People were , but he certainly knew enough about them to guess that the only excuse they would find understandable for an able-bodied man who did not mount a horse was a broken leg . He assumed that many of them rode even with broken legs , and he was perfectly right . Horsemanship , from the moment he accepted Short 's invitation , became a challenge , which was next best to the thing he loved most  --  a risk . Pat Shannon was a born risk taker who understood that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of successful risk taking . But his failures , few as they were , had been business failures , and they had never been due to lack of effort or preparation . Since it was clearly possible to learn to ride , ride he would . Short had said that he had some " fairly pleasant trails " on his place . Shannon had had one of his secretaries check the place out and discovered that it was called Fairfax Plantation , covered eighteen hundred acres , boasted a private jet airstrip , housed twenty servants and was worth , conservatively , four million dollars . Shannon did n't have to be very clever to realize that if he were to go hacking about on almost two thousand acres , he had to count  | on fairly long hours in the saddle . And Shannon was clever , indeed exceptionally so . And a clever Irishman can be counted among the cleverest kind of man the human race produces . Had n't Shannon 's favorite Irishman , George Bernard Shaw , said , " A lifetime of happiness ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Earth . " Pat Shannon grimly reminded himself of these words as he gave his horse the signal to canter for the fiftieth time that evening . " You 're making progress , " Chuck Byers said drily , in a tone of voice which took any approval out of the remark . He had never had such a pupil before . He hoped never to have such a one again . Shannon had told him he wanted to learn to ride . Fair enough  --  lots of people did . But no one else had ever demanded that he be able to trot at the end of the first lesson , canter at the end of the second , and gallop at the end of the third . Byers had told him it was impossible . Byers had said he 'd break a bone at the least and he had made Shannon sign a paper saying that the stable was n't responsible for any injuries to the man and that Shannon was responsible for all injuries to the horse . But the bastard had galloped after three lessons although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his car that every muscle in his body was killing him . The man was a demon , Byers thought . After the third lesson Shannon had sent out a crew of electricians to rig up lights around the ring so that he could ride late into the night , and he had insisted on a three-hour lesson every single night , paying so much that Byers had had to accommodate him in spite of his family 's objections . He had n't spent any time with his wife and kids since Shannon had started this nonsense . Something about the single-minded way in which Shannon tackled the business of learning to ride made Byers feel downright vindictive toward the man . To Byers riding was the last vestige of chivalry in the world , a realm of magic which linked the past to the present as nothing else did , a sport that was both his religion and his romance . He grew more and more disgruntled as he watched Shannon make incredible progress of a mechanical kind , but without falling in any way under the spell of horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another form of locomotion . And not for him the ritual , pleasant half-hour of discussion after the lesson was over . No , the man just said a brief goodnight and disappeared into that big black Cadillac in which his bored driver had  | been reading all the while , and sped off to the city . Byers was a proud , sensitive man , and he knew he was being treated as a mere convenience . If a robot could teach riding , he was convinced that Shannon would have preferred it . He never realized , nor did Shannon tell him , that Pat Shannon did n't think of learning to ride as a human occupation which made human contact with his instructor necessary . It was merely a challenge he had chosen to confront , an obstacle which he had to conquer , a necessary nuisance which he had to put behind him . He went at it with total concentration , as if he were breaking rocks on a chain gang with an overseer watching him . He resented having to spend these hours in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had only one moment of non-instructional discourse in the past month . Shannon was limping badly , Byers noticed , in his new boots from M. J. Knoud , Inc. , the venerable firm which had also made his handsome riding clothes . " Trouble with the boots , Mr. Shannon ? " Byers remarked , not without malice . " My ankle bones are bleeding , " said Shannon in a matter-of-fact fashion . " I suppose it 's always like that when you break in new boots . " " Not necessarily  --  people do n't all go at it the way you do . " " What size foot do you have , Byers ? " " Twelve-C . " " That 's my size . Will you sell me your boots ? " " What ? No , Mr. Shannon , you do n't want these boots . " " It happens that I do  --  they 're exactly what I want . Beautiful leather and well-broken in . We wear the same size and you certainly have other pairs . " " I do indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , but I want your boots , Byers . I 'll give twice what you paid for them , hell , make it three times . " " You 're absolutely sure about that , Mr. Shannon ? " Byers did n't show he was offended . " My God , they 're not sacred objects , man , just boots . What 's all the fuss about ? " Patrick demanded , more harshly than he realized . He 'd been in a considerable pain for three hours , although he would never have admitted it . " They 're yours , " said Byers curtly . " No charge . " He had been  | many things in his life but never had he bargained over second-hand boots . " Thanks , Byers , " Patrick said . " I really appreciate it . " As far as he was concerned , it was the least the man could do , although he would not have grudged him any profit he cared to take . Business was business . He had no conception of the cult of tack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the equestrian world . As Byers handed over the worn pair of boots he thought to himself , screw you , Pat Shannon . Who the fuck do you think you are ? It was a thought many people had had about Shannon in the course of his life , and all of them had eventually realized that whoever Shannon thought he was , he turned out to be . This had not endeared him to a rather large group  --  and if he 'd bothered to consider this he would not have been astonished . Particularly since he 'd forgotten all their names in the course of his climb to the top . A dedicated nonconformist , a maverick by deepest instinct , his success had depended on his following no one 's plans but those he chose for himself , without consultation . There were only a few men Patrick Shannon considered his equals in the corporate world . No man , no matter how powerful , who had inherited his business , belonged in his peer group . They had to have made it on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he 'd grown up he had won a scholarship to St. Anthony 's , a minor Catholic boys ' prep school . The scholarship had been established by a former student , now an elderly and childless millionaire , for a parentless boy who showed equal excellence in academics and athletics . At St. Anthony 's , Patrick saw immediately that he had found his first world to conquer . Nothing about the upper-middle-class East Coast boys he found himself among was familiar ; their points of reference and the things they took for granted were all unknown territory to him . For the first two years , he watched , listened and learned , always more comfortable with the adults in the school constellation than with boys of his own age . His speech had always been correct , taught , as he had been all his life , by nuns , and fortunately , the school required a uniform so that all the boys dressed alike . He learned that  | his black hair had always been cut too short , that his aggressiveness on the football field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he relished the exercise of his brain , it was preferable to save demonstrations of intelligence for exams and term papers rather than display it in the classroom . By junior year he was ready to emerge from the unobtrusive place he had taken everywhere except in sports . Pat Shannon had carefully marked out the boys he wanted to become friends with , singling out from the herd of his classmates the half dozen who displayed excellence , not merely in their achievements but in their character . By the end of his four years at St. Anthony 's , he had made six friends he would never lose . Loyalty was his religion . If any of his friends had asked Pat to meet him in Singapore by noon on the day after tomorrow , with no explanation given , he would have been there . And they would have been there for him . Lacking a family of his own , he had created a family from strangers . The flavor of his soul had always been tough but loving . However , his strength concealed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall boy , big boned , and fast as a leopard . His coloring left no question about his ethnic origins : it was classically Black Irish , blue black hair , dark blue eyes and white skin that flushed easily . His forehead was broad , his eyes set wide apart under heavy brows , and his open smile was so winning that it was easy  --  though dangerous ? to forget how bright he was . By senior year he was president of the class , captain of the football team and first in all his classes . He won a full scholarship to Tulane from which he graduated in three years by taking an extra class load , going to summer school every summer , and restricting his sports activity to football . At twenty-three , Patrick Shannon was a graduate of the Harvard Business School and ready to conquer the world . A week before graduation he had been hired by Nat Temple , the man who had founded Supracorp many decades before . Shannon gave himself ten years to make it to a position close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first three years to absolutely unrelenting work . Pat Shannon was perfectly aware , from visiting his friends , that living well took time and money and he would have neither to spare , by his calculations , until he was twenty-six . Although he felt an impatience to enjoy the good things in life , his self-discipline and bred-in-the-bone motivation were strong enough to make him keep to his plan . He never considered marrying  | money  --  he had met many of his classmates ' sisters who would have provided it  --  but everything about the idea displeased him . He had to do it on his own  --  that need to prove himself was stronger than any other he had ever experienced , and each victory only led to new challenges which had to be met . In Shannon 's life there were no plateaus , no resting places from which to look back and contentedly relish the victory gained , the game won , the achievement completed . Now , at thirty-eight , he was saturated with success . Nat Temple , the man who had first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years before , retaining the title of chairman of the board , leaving Shannon to run a conglomerate that , from the time he was put in charge , started the expansion that had recently doubled its earning per share . His own salary and bonuses were in excess of three quarters of a million dollars a year . A fair number of the powerful and conservative men among the major Supracorp stockholders were still not at all sure they approved of him . He had his enemies , watchful ones , who resented the firmness with which Nat Temple had backed Shannon and given him his head , who envied him his youth and his achievements , men who did n't like to take chances of any sort . These enemies were quiet for the moment but they were waiting and watching , ready to push Shannon out if he ever gave them the opportunity . Shannon had acquired all the material things that go with this sort of success : an apartment high up in the United Nations Plaza , decorated by John Saladino in what he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a style that Shannon found out  --  too late  --  that he did n't enjoy although he admired it in the abstract ; memberships in the Century , River and University clubs ; the house in Easthampton which he almost never had time to use ; and the inevitable divorce from a woman he should have known better than to marry : a socialite and beauty who had one of those dark , sensuous , syrupy , knowing voices which other women dislike and mistrust instantly and for good reason . There had been no children . If there had been , perhaps there would have been no divorce , for Shannon , although not a religious man , never forgot the loneliness of being brought up without parents . After his brief marriage was over , he permitted himself only a series of second-string girls whom he took with such intense , entire , purely physical thoroughness that it was as if they had been consumed by a brush fire set by a carelessly flung match in late autumn . The finality of falling truly in love , the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease . Love , he sensed , was a greater risk than even he cared to take . Supracorp , with its web of companies cosmetics , perfumes , foods , magazines , liquors , television stations and real estate  --  was his baby . His children were the boys of the Police Athletic League , with whom , unknown to anyone in his world , he spent as much of every weekend as he could . With these boys , an observer would have seen uncritical , undemanding , extravagant love pouring from him . To his boys , being with him was like being in a brisk sea breeze on a day of blue sky . He made them aware of life 's possibilities , and he tried to give them as much as he could of any knowledge he possessed , whether it was how to hit a ball , how to fly a kite , or how to do long division . The years had not changed his smile ; it was still open , still winning , and his eyes were still of that blue which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines on either side of his mouth and deep horizontal lines on his broad forehead over which his dark hair always fell no matter how often he pushed it back . Patrick Shannon had propelled himself right past and through his youth , and he would never be able to recapture a time  --  not even in memory  --  that simply had n't existed for him . He had never been really young . He had never played . He had never had time for irresponsibility or carefree freedom . It was quite enough , he told himself , that he had accumulated success , power , money , information and a small group of friends , without also having reaped a harvest of nostalgia for fun and games . And what 's more , now he could  --  more or less  --  ride a goddamned fucking horse . When Hamilton Short , a shrewd , tough real-estate manipulator , made his first , second and third million he put them in treasury bonds and forgot about them . At forty-two , already paunchy and bald , his tenth million safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mullins , a timidly luscious eighteen-year-old from an ancient but impoverished Virginia family , to marry him . During the next eight years , as business took the Shorts to Dallas , Miami and Chicago to live , Topsy produced three children , all girls , and Ham produced more millions ; by his estimate he was worth twenty-five million , and the real-estate business had never been better . Topsy had gone to a famous horsy finishing school on the last remnants of her family 's money , and there she had met many New York and Long Island girls from rich , social families . She had followed  | their careers in fashion magazines and society columns with biting envy . She had married for money and all it had brought her was three pregnancies and fleeting acquaintances in three , to her , provincial cities . The only way to really be a part of the fashionable world was to be considered fashionable in New York City  --  other places did n't exist on Topsy 's narrow horizon . However , she had a clear-eyed idea of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York life , particularly a stranger who could claim only a few schoolgirl friendships , long faded , and whose husband was hardly an asset to a dinner party . She resolved to make her assault on New York from her home territory , from Virginia where her family was known and respected . She decided that an estate in the heart of the thousand square miles that make up Northern Virginia 's Hunt Country was the answer ; it would take the curse off new money . When Ham was informed by Topsy that it was time for them to buy a place in Middleburg , a town of 833 people , lopsidedly , if conveniently , divided into two groups , millionaires and servants , there was more than restlessness in her words . He heard the unmistakable indication that only a considerable , a very considerable establishment in Middleburg , would guarantee that Ham Short 's marriage would continue to run in the comfortable , well-ordered and convenient way he had learned to take for granted . At twenty-five , Topsy 's early promise had ripened into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth of children to disturb her concentration on herself , had polished her chestnuthaired , hazel-eyed prettiness until it gleamed . The large breasts , wide hips and tiny waist that had first caught Ham Short 's eyes were as appealing as ever . Even if he rarely bothered to appreciate them now , he certainly did n't want any domestic problems . He was not a sensual man , a quick fuck every week or two was all he asked , but he insisted on peace and quiet at home while he worked on more millions . Middleburg or Miami , it made no difference to him , as long as Topsy would stop complaining about their lack of social life . Fortunately Ham Short continued to increase his millions in the next few years , because the restoration of Fairfax Plantation consumed money as greedily as if it had been a whale swallowing plankton . Fairfax , a late Colonial mansion , had been built in the 1750s by master craftsmen brought over from England by the first Oliver Fairfax who , like other wealthy Virginians of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge to realize that only in  | England could he find the workmanship he demanded . Unfortunately , the last Oliver Fairfax had long outlived his family 's fortune and when the Shorts bought Fairfax Plantation , it was close to a ruin . But nothing , short of fire , could disguise the glorious wood carving throughout the house , which the legendary William Buckland had fashioned out of clear , mellow white pine and perfectly seasoned walnut and poplar , all of which came from the plantation 's own forests , as did the bricks which were baked from clay dug from the broad fields . Buckland 's Palladian woodwork , equal to that of any great home in England , had been set off by a collection of Chinese Chippendale , Hepplewhite and Sheraton furniture , covered in reproductions of the richest fabrics of the late Colonial period . The marvels of the interior  --  Topsy Short 's decorator specialized in Instant Museum Quality  --  were quite overshadowed by the gardens which no amount of neglect could affect , depending as they did on a severely classic plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred and twenty years to reach their current majestic proportions . Topsy Short had to be content with letting her horses graze in the great fields behind the house although she would have preferred to be able to see them from the front rooms of the mansion  --  as did many of her neighbors . " Lordy , " she would say enviously . " That old Liz Whitney Tippett 's horses can just about poke their noses into her drawing room . " " Well , dig up the boxwood , " Ham suggested absently . " What ? My landscape architect would kill me . They 're historic . There 's nothing like them , not even in Upperville or Warrenton or Leesburg . He told me that even Bunny Mellon does n't have older boxwood , she said , invoking the name of the largely invisible queen of the Hunt Country . " Then do n't dig up the goddamned boxwood . " Ham Short , master of all he surveyed , had more on his mind than hedges . The offer from Supracorp was interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his healthy real-estate company to Supracorp 's even healthier two-billion-dollar operation , the stock he would receive would rise to a point where , instead of working on his thirtieth million , he could start thinking in terms of his sixtieth . Not only that , it would get him out from under the dayto-day operation of what was essentially a one-man show . His children were all girls , he had no one to bring into a family business , and it would give him the time to start living the life of the  | gentleman Topsy had always tried to pretend he was . But on the other hand , did he want to give up control ? Was n't it more satisfying to have his own company and be free to run it as he chose ? Why become another acquisition of Supracorp , why become another division head under Patrick Shannon ? Did he really want to live like a gentleman and take an interest in the Middleburg Hunt and give an honest damn about horses ? Perhaps the coming weekend , with the chance to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the questions he asked himself , as he wavered between selling and not selling . He 'd asked Topsy to keep the guest list small for exactly that reason . " Who 's coming this weekend ? " Ham asked abruptly . " The Hemmings and the Stantons from Charlottesville , the Dempseys from Keeneland and Princess Daisy Valensky , to do a sketch of Cindy . That Shannon of yours , of course , and . . . some people from New York ? " he asked idly . Eyes wide with a mixture of terrified anticipation and excitement , Topsy answered , " Robin and Vanessa Valarian . " " The dressmaker ? Now what the hell do you want with them ? " Ham asked the question casually , not noticing his wife 's flustered air . " Oh , Ham , I do n't know how I stand it , " Topsy wailed plaintively . " You 're a disgrace . The Valarians are  --  oh , how can I make you understand  --  they 're the chicest people in New York ! They go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valarian a little at school  --  she was three years ahead of me  --  I bumped into her last time I went to New York for shopping , and we had a drink together , but I was n't sure they 'd come when I asked them . " " Why not , are n't we good enough for a dressmaker and his wife ? " Ham demanded . " We 're not chic , Ham , we 're just rich , and not as rich as really rich people either ! " she said with an accusing note in her voice . " No use your snorting like that . . . you have to be worth over two hundred million to be really rich  --  I read all the lists  --  and you know as well as I do that we 're just small potatoes compared to  --  oh , never mind ! " She flounced off the chair in which she 'd been sitting and started to finger a Chinese Export bowl her decorator had insisted she buy  --  a steal at twenty-eight hundred dollars . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be chic ? Who the hell gives -a shit ? What the hell does it mean anyway  --  who elected  | the Valarians to decide ? " Now Ham was injured . He was proud of his money and he did n't like being reminded of the fact that , rich as he was , he still could n't play with the big boys . " Oh , Ham , honestly ! It merely means that they 're in  --  in , damn it , the way we 'll never be ! They 're invited to every good party , and they get pages and pages in Vogue and House and Garden and Architectural Digest on their apartment and their table settings  --  oh , and they fly all over the world to be with people like Cristina Brandolini and Helene Rochas and Andre Oliver and Fleur Cowles Meyer and Jacqueline Machado-Macedo  --  people you would n't ever know ! Unless the Valarians are there a party does n't have cachet ! " " Cachet ? Christ , Topsy , you 've got another bug up your ass , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this museum and enough horses for the Charge of the Light Brigade . Now you 've finally become best buddies with our neighbors and you still need a stamp of approval from a dressmaker ? I do n't understand you . " If Ham Short had n't been so offended he might have realized that there was something a little overdone in Topsy 's insistence on the chic of the Valarians . . . something a little overdone in her display of pique . " Robin Valarian is one of the most famous dress designers in the country , " Topsy answered loftily , " and , as for Vanessa , she happens to be considered the most elegant woman in New York . " " I 've seen his picture enough to know what he does  --  if you ask me , he looks like a fruit  --  full-blown . " " Do n't be disgusting , Ham ! They 've been married almost as long as we have . Men like you always think other men , who do n't happen to be interested in merely making money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it 's gay ' ? I suppose that 's the only possible word to use ? " " Yes , as a matter of fact , it is , " Topsy retorted , in a voice she decided to make conciliating . This argument was driving her wild with nerves . As Ham Short 's irritation cooled , Topsy found herself replaying , for the thousandth time , the scene in the Valarians ' library a few weeks ago in New York . Vanessa had poured her a Dubonnet and flattered Topsy with questions . " Tell me about your life , " she 'd asked with unmistakable interest . " What 's it like living in Middleburg most of the year ? Divine or drear ? "  | " If I could n't get up to New York every few weeks I do n't think I could stand it , " Topsy had admitted . " I 'm Virginia born but I think I have New York soul . It 's simply too quiet ... but Ham loves it . " " And what Ham loves , Ham gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and closed the door of the library . " I think it 's a crime that anyone as deliciously pretty as you is wasted in Horse Country , " she told Topsy , coming to sit next to her on the loveseat . Topsy blushed in embarrassment and surprise . In school Vanessa had been the leader on whom half the girls in Topsy 's class had had a crush  --  Vanessa , even then , had been sophisticated beyond their teenage dreams . " Thank you , " she murmured , sipping her Dubonnet . " It 's the simple truth . Do you know that way back at school I noticed you ? I 'll never forget how you looked with all that wonderful red brown hair  --  it 's only a little darker now  --  and even those frightful uniforms we had to wear could n't hide the fact that you were going to have a perfect figure . I envy you  --  I 'm so damn skinny  --  I 'd give anything for a few curves . Did n't you ever notice me watching you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in denial . " Well , you must have had other things on your mind  --  I used to look at you at meals  --  just a peek , mind you . " Vanessa laughed and casually took one of Topsy 's hands in hers , gazing at it as calmly as if she were a fortuneteller . Suddenly she bent and kissed Topsy 's palm with a warm , open mouth , laughed , and released the hand as if nothing at all had happened . That had been all , but again and again , from that afternoon until now , Topsy 's mind had returned to the scene , wondering what might have happened next , and then telling herself that nothing , absolutely nothing could possibly have happened next  --  she was just being silly . " Ham , " she said , returning to the present , " let 's not fight , please . I 'm nervous enough about the weekend without having a fight . " " Okay , honey  --  I do n't know what the whole thing 's about anyway , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . And , if you want my opinion , those Valarians will be more than enough impressed by the Hemmings and the Stantons and the Dempseys and Patrick Shannon  --  and what 's her name , that princess , so will you , for Christ 's sake , just stop wandering around like you 're about to break- that bowl ? Sure , it 's insured , but I 'd hate to try to collect ! "  | On mid-Saturday morning all of Topsy Short 's house guests assembled at the stables . Topsy supervised the matching of horse to rider and only her lifetime of riding enabled her to fulfill this task with an outward show of calm . She was in the grip of an emotion she avoided examining , but she felt more ill-at-ease , more electrically anticipatory than she had in years . She was staying behind to keep Vanessa Valarian company since Vanessa had announced , at breakfast , with a laugh that was delighted with itself , that she had always been terrified of horses , even at school . She made the confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saddle of a large black gelding , but he was too intent to take in much of the busy , cheerful scene around him . This was the first time he 'd actually been on a horse in the company of riders other than his instructor . He was absorbed in remembering every detail of every lesson he 'd taken , blocking out the distraction of the stomping and blowing of the other horses , the maddening way they persisted in getting in each other 's way . He tried to keep his lively mount to one side of the milling crowd of horses and riders , hoping that the brute was n't as nervous as he was , and wondering if it was true that the horse knew how he felt just from his touch on the reins . Young Cindy Short was mounted on a handsome pony , and Daisy had been allotted a grand chestnut mare who had fetched a healthy forty thousand dollars two years ago at the world famous Keeneland July auction of yearlings . After sharing Cindy 's breakfast and spending the early hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cindy were fast friends . When she rode , Daisy dressed with severe correctness . She braided her hair tightly and then hid it under the regulation protective hat , covered in black velvet , that is to riders what a hardhat is to construction workers . She wore a snood into which she tucked the ends of her braids so that they would n't catch on branches . Ham Short wanted to demonstrate his daughter 's equestrian achievements to his guests . " Cindy , " he called , " you go first and we 'll follow . " Cindy , who was patient in her familiar role as a show-and-tell child , kicked her pony into a trot and then into a canter . Daisy , who wanted to observe her as she rode , waited until Cindy had had ample time to be admired and then followed the roly-poly figure . Daisy sat her thoroughbred with such beautiful calm that she made a noble and gallant sight in the crisp Virginia morning . . . in spite of the fact  | that Theseus followed closely behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Patrick Shannon watched Daisy disappear over a slight rise he had a sudden perception of what riding could be . Whoever that is , he thought , she 's the real thing . All of his life spent in conquering new worlds had sharpened his eye to the look of those who do effortlessly what it is supremely difficult to do at all . He knew little about ballet but he could always tell a great dancer by the way the hair rose on the back of his neck at the sight of certain , apparently effortless gestures . Daisy 's slender , straight back , her perfectly relaxed shoulders and arms , the carelessly confident poise of her head as she rode away , filled him with admiration . . . and bitterness . He was acutely aware of the splendid economy of her movements , movements over which he 'd spent the last month sweating and cursing and bleeding . To be able to command a horse , with an imperceptible pressure of the hands and knees and calves , so that the damn fool beast sprang forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a slow canter , but at a fast canter and no nonsense about it . . . shit , you had to be born to it , he thought , it has to be given to you , handed over as just another of the accomplishments people like you are expected to master . Patrick Shannon never allowed himself to compare his grim and lonely childhood with the lives of the people who lived in the world in which he was now such a potent force , but every once in a while , taken unaware , in a situation he had n't yet conquered , he would become briefly , but stunningly , conscious of early deprivation ; relive in a flash the late and difficult transition from the gauche boy who entered prep school on a scholarship to the man he was today . The others  --  his friends at St. Anthony 's , at Tulane , at Harvard  --  most of them had had it good , so good  --  and it showed  --  perhaps not to them , but to him because he was n't one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he said to himself , the momentary bitterness fading , that 's the secret . As he ordered himself to relax , Ham Short walked his horse over to Patrick 's . " Do you mind if we do n't try to keep up with the others ? " Ham asked . " I ride Western  --  kinda like a rocking chair  --  never had time to learn English  --  a bunch of nonsense if you ask me . " Patrick looked down at his host , incredibly attired in cowboy boots and chaps , slumped in a Western saddle on a comfortable looking cow pony . " Whatever you say , " he answered . Ham Short wondered why Shannon was looking so stunned . Did n't a man have a right to ride any way he chose , for Christ 's sake ?  | Vanessa Valarian and Topsy walked back to the house in silence , broken only by Vanessa 's vague comments on the weather , the location of the house , the landscape ; e ; comments which Topsy barely heard . As they walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Show me the house , " she demanded in the low , ardent voice that was her chief beauty . She was supple as a piece of silk , so lean and slender that her husband 's dresses never looked as right on a professional model as they did on her . She had made the most of looks which depended on absolutely white skin contrasting with the blackness of her hair , which she wore in a pageboy style with straight bangs right down to her eyebrows . This unfashionable Prince Valiant hair style , " signature hair " as a fashion magazine called it , was only one of the marks of personal style which made her unmistakable . Others were the wide , angular jaw , the heavily made-up , almost Oriental eyes , the bright red lipstick on her wide mouth , the big , unabashed grin she wore in every photograph ever published of her . She had curiously beautiful hands , long and slim , as supple and strong as if she were a sculptress or a pianist , yet her nails were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant fingers . Vanessa never compromised or changed her looks . She wore her long nose as if it were the mark of royal birth . For this mild , Virginia morning she had chosen a thin , far-from-simple dress of black cashmere , huge gold earrings and eight David Webb bracelets , a costume she had picked deliberately for its incongruence , the way it jarred with her surroundings ; an effect she enjoyed creating . Topsy flutteringly led the way through several excessively fine rooms in which the Hepplewhite hunting boards , the Sheraton barrel chairs and the Sully portraits had been assembled for just such a display . She found herself forgetting which period pieces of furniture belonged to , fumbling over the simplest names , actually trembling at the entrance to each room , not because she had any doubt of its correctness , but because she was so intensely conscious of Vanessa 's elegant , dark presence at her side , never touching her , but never as far away as people normally kept from each other . She felt as jittery as she had before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanessa pronounced , " and it suits you . . . it makes New York look terribly raw . But now , my young Topsy , do n't you think it 's time to show me the upstairs ? I 'm curious to see your bedroom  --  the reception rooms of a house are never as revealing as  | the private rooms , do n't you think ? Or am I being too nosy ? It 's just that I 've already seen so many marvels that I 'm quite ill with envy . Next time that you come to visit us in the city  --  and I hope it 'll be soon  --  you 'll understand . " Topsy caught her breath in leaping joy . Magic words  --  a promise , a visit ! In Topsy 's bedroom Vanessa sat down on the edge of the wide canopied four poster that Topsy had prevailed on her unwilling decorator to swathe in three hundred yards of peach silk . " And is this the letto matrimoniale ? " asked Vanessa , indicating the four poster with a languid wave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . No , Ham sleeps in his own room . He likes to work late and start telephoning early . " " And does he come to visit his wife in her bed , or does she go to his ? " Vanessa continued , imperturbably . " Why . . . ah ... " " Oh , Topsy , what a darling you are . . . you 're blushing again , the way you did in New York . Oh , I know , when people tell you that , it only makes you blush more  --  but I could n't resist . Sit here . . . I ca n't talk to you when you 're a mile away . " Vanessa patted the coverlet , until Topsy , almost unwillingly , sat down next to her . Vanessa took her hand and circled Topsy 's palm with one of her talented , Gothic fingers . " I wondered if you were going to invite us ... after what happened in New York I was worried that you might be afraid of me . . . no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been thinking of you every day . . . thinking that we could so easily become very , very close friends ... would that please you , young Topsy ? " Idly she licked the tip of her forefinger and with a rapid movement touched the wet finger gently to the center of Topsy 's outstretched palm . When Topsy gasped at the unmistakably explicit signal but did n't draw back , she raised the hand to her lips and took one of Topsy 's fingers in her mouth , sucking on it gently from the base of the finger to the tip of the nail . Topsy moaned . " You like that  --  do n't you ? Remember the first time I kissed your hand  --  remember how surprised you were ? And do you still remember what I told you  --  that I 'd had my eye on you years ago ? " Mutely Topsy nodded . As strong and fast as a man , Vanessa put one arm around Topsy 's waist while she bent and brushed her neck with a feathery kiss , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do anything to you that you do n't like , . . do n't be afraid of me . . . you 're not , are you ? Good . "  | Swiftly , on stocking feet , Vanessa locked the bedroom door and returned to the bed where Topsy half sat , half lay back with eyes wide and wild with reluctant temptation . " How adorable you are  --  you still have your shoes on . " Vanessa gave her low laugh . " Let 's get rid of your shoes , at least . . . " She bent and took off Topsy 's shoes . " Close your eyes , " Vanessa whispered , " and let me be good to you  --  you need someone to be good to you , do n't you , young one  --  someone who just wants to make you feel all the things you 've always dreamed of feeling but have n't really ever felt . . . oh , yes , I thought so . . . I could tell just by looking at you that you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbuttoned Topsy 's blouse and released the hook which held her brassiere together in the front . Topsy had magnificent , soft round breasts , with prominent brown nipples , surprisingly dark on her white , abundant flesh . " Oh , but you 're beautiful ! You 're superb ... I knew you would be , " Vanessa whispered , lightly tracing the outline of Topsy 's half open mouth with one dark red fingertip . She glanced carefully at her prey , not wanting to do anything too suddenly . With her warm , agile fingers she traced a line from the girl 's throat down under and around each heavy breast , creating a circle of exquisite lightning , but holding herself back from the nipples that she could see were becoming tight and hard . A voluptuary of the most accomplished kind , she was infinitely willing to wait for her pleasures and nothing excited her as much as the initiation of a woman she knew had never experienced the excruciating pleasure she could give her . " Topsy , this is all for you . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to move an inch . . . just lie back and let me look at you ... " As she unbuttoned the waistband of the woman 's skirt and slipped it off in a gentle movement , she sucked again on Topsy 's fingers , taking two of them in her wide mouth and fluttering them with her practiced tongue . Topsy shuddered , unable to believe that she was becoming so excited by nothing more than being touched on her breasts and on her fingers . She relaxed when Vanessa told her that nothing was expected of her . . . she would n't have known what to do . Now Vanessa surrounded each nipple with five adept , caressing , gentle fingers which delicately teased them up into two hard points . Only when Topsy began to sigh , unable to remain silent , did Vanessa finally fasten her mouth on one nipple with luxurious leisure , flicking the point of her tongue over first one hot , hard nubbin and then the other . She spent long , long minutes without ever leaving those wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with swift strokes of her entire tongue , until they were  | stimulated to a point just below pain . Only then did she stretch down her arms and take off the rest of Topsy 's clothes . The girl 's eyes were still closed , Vanessa noted as she rapidly took off her own clothes . Good , it was easier that way . . . the first time . She cradled Topsy 's head in one slender , strong arm and with the other reached down and ran her fingers as lightly as possible , so that their touch was barely perceptible , yet maddeningly arousing , over the delicate swell of her , down to just above the chestnut tangle of thick pubic hair . When Topsy made no indication of protest , Vanessa moved , with the grace she was famous for , and straddled the woman 's body , one knee on either side of Topsy 's full hips . She sat back on her heels and devoted herself to gliding her fingertips down Topsy 's beautiful white thighs and calves all the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding the pubic curls with absolute discipline . She saw Topsy 's hands come to life ; one of them reached down and captured one of hers and pulled it toward the mound of Venus that the girl was lifting up toward her . Vanessa freed her hand and whispered , " No , no , you ca n't have it yet . . . you 're not ready . . . " and she began to caress the soft skin inside of Topsy 's thighs , her fingers reaching higher and higher until they were fluttering just at the rim of the pubic tangle . Topsy moaned imploringly and opened her legs . Vanessa saw the slick glisten of wetness on the offered lips . Her own vulva was so heavy and congested that she could scarcely restrain herself from grinding it into the girl , but she held back , crouching low to blow gently on Topsy 's thick hairs , parting the curls with her breath , until she could see the girl 's swollen clitoris . Then she reached out again with her tongue and , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again at the tiny organ , sometimes sucking it with her whole mouth , sometimes just licking it with a light , flickering touch . " Fuck me , for God 's sake  --  fuck me ! " Topsy muttered , unable to endure any more . Vanessa knit the three middle fingers of her right hand together , and worked them several inches up between those eager lips . Topsy strained upward frantically , and Vanessa , kneeling , bent again and took the girl 's vulva entirely into her hot , avid , wide mouth , sucking rhythmically on the clitoris at the same time that she slid her three fingers firmly in and out of Topsy 's vagina , sometimes only an inch or two up , sometimes as far as they could go . Topsy was aware only of the most intense delight ; the fingers in her vagina produced a hardness and knobbiness of stimulation that a smooth penis never  | had , and the sucking , oh , the teasing sucking , was like nothing she had ever believed possible . She felt herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then coming into Vanessa 's mouth with a bursting rush and a widening pool of spasms which made her scream in incredulous abandon . While she was still throbbing and jerking her hips forward , Vanessa threw herself on the other woman , kissing her for the first time on her dry , open mouth , pressing her own vulva , lightly covered with dark hair , into Topsy 's curly mound , cupping Topsy 's full , round bottom in both her hands and rubbing , relentlessly until she came quickly into the masterful orgasm she had been holding back for so long . Minutes , many minutes passed before Topsy sat up , dizzy but still aware of the passage of time . " They 'll be back for lunch in ten minutes . . . and Ham 'll be calling for me . What must I look like ? " " You look glorious , " Vanessa said , slithering quickly into her clothes . " Do you have a garter belt and stockings around some-where ? " " I bought them once . . . for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great wonders . Why ? " " Would you wear them , for me ? Without panties ? All day long , all evening , all day tomorrow ? So I can look at you and think of just how I could be touching you under your clothes . . . so you can look at me and see me thinking ? " " Oh ! " " Will you ? " " Yes , God , yes ! " As the members of the Short 's house party gathered for drinks before lunch , Robin Valarian approached his wife and put his arm 11 around her . " Did you have a good ride , my angel ? " she asked him , tilting up her proud nose and widening her Oriental eyes . " Marvelous  --  it 's really a shame you 've become afraid of horses , my poor pet . You used to ride so well . And you , was the hunting Illgood ? " " Superb , quite simply superb . " " I hoped it would be . I almost envy you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then spent the afternoon sketching the little girl on her pony . The  | younger girls , who were seven and five , equestrians both , watched respectfully for a while and finally , bored , wandered off . After she 'd worked until Cindy would pose no longer , Daisy indulged in the great gift the weekends with the Horse People could provide : a solitary ride accompanied only by Theseus . These hours alone , galloping , free , abandoned , mindlessly happy , as if she moved in a wind of vernal delight , were a luxury she could never have afforded otherwise , and she 'd become adept at snatching them when she could , without taking time she could have used for work . Reluctantly , in the last afternoon light , she trotted back to the stables and went to her room to bathe and dress for dinner . It was the thing she liked least about these weekends , she thought , as she carefully put away her riding clothes , the obligatory dinner with the assembled guests , the obligatory conversations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacted from her actually . Kiki often wondered why she disliked it so , why she endured it only to help sell her work . " I would adore to be a princess , " she said , shaking her head at Daisy severely . She 'd never been able to explain , not even to Kiki , what she could barely begin to work out for herself , that she felt , in some deep way , like an impostor in the persona of Princess Daisy Valensky , as if she had no right to the title . Granted , titles were out of date in the modern world , except for those few countries still ruled by monarchs , but many people in many other countries still used them without the malaise she felt . As Daisy lowered herself into her hot bath , she realized , because of the sudden shock of comfort she experienced from the embrace of the water , that she was sad , with a familiar sadness which overcame her from time to time , a sadness against which she battled without understanding its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see coming like the first hint of a sea fog dimming the light , a tendril drawn across the back of her mind that soon turned the furnishings of her life into dismal heaps . In such a mood , if she were home , she would creep under all the blankets she could find , thrust her feet into heavy wool socks and lie shivering for hours , wondering why the future held no delight , trying to imagine a situation , a place , a happening which could tempt her back to reality . She would hold Theseus close , ruffling him over and over , and cuddling him tightly . Whenever she tried to trap this despairing sadness , lay it bare and examine it , Daisy was immediately caught up in a web of unwelcome questions that no one left alive could answer for her . What if , for instance , she had two parents like most people ?  | What if her mother , like other women who are separated from their husbands , had managed to explain to Daisy , when she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing no strangers , having no contact with the outside world ? Even if the explanation had n't made too much sense it might have satisfied her for a while , until she was old enough to understand . What if her father had ever told her why he could only spend such a short time with her and had to leave so abruptly , year after year , keeping her in constant fear that he 'd never return , in spite of the letters he sent her ? What if her mother  --  that all-too-vague memory of absolute security and love  --  had n't gone without a farewell , vanishing into the sea on a sunny afternoon ? What if her father had allowed Dani to stay with her instead of imposing a rigorous , hermetic seal of silence on her very existence ? And what if Stash had n't died when she was fifteen ; what if he were still alive , protecting her by his very existence ? What if Ram had been a real older brother , concerned and kind , someone to whom she could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Anabel knew he was ? Daisy got out of the tub and started to dress . As she brushed her hair she looked at Kiki 's fake emeralds that lay on the dressing table . The necklace and bracelets would be perfection loaded onto the green tweed jacket with its ruffled lapels , but the earrings would be wasted , hidden by her hair . She found some hairpins and twisted them through the great oval pendant drops , rimmed with rhinestones . She was wearing her hair down naturally this evening , after having kept it braided all day , and the gorgeous , heavy , silver-gilt stuff , in which she deftly fastened the earrings , fell in little ripples . Her Schiaparelli trouser suit made her look like a young Robin Hood , a Robin Hood who 'd gone all the way to Paris to rob the rich , and , as she finished dressing , she stared at herself in the mirror as firmly as if she were dealing with a skittish horse and said out loud , " Daisy Valensky , it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Patrick Shannon recognized Daisy as the girl he 'd seen riding that morning only from the set of her head as she entered the drawing room . Otherwise he would have thought she was a new arrival , since he had not seen her at either breakfast or lunch . As she entered the room , in which the other guests were already assembled , a small piece of time seemed to be frozen , a split second in which the hum of conversation hesitated , fragmented and then resumed . Daisy knew no one in the room , and Topsy guided her around ,  | making introductions . As she approached Patrick , he thought , so that 's who she is , he might have guessed . Although he spent no time at all keeping up with celebrity news , like everyone else he had been aware of Daisy 's existence . He could vaguely remember the cover of her as a baby in Life when he 'd been a teenager . They shook hands with perfunctory smiles , Daisy preoccupied with remembering all the new names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shannon trying to fit her into a slot . He was a man who liked to place new people immediately , get a fix on them , so that he knew where they stood in relation to him . He had already dismissed the Horse People as utterly unimportant in his scheme of things , tagged Vanessa and Robin Valarian as people he would never do business with and become convinced that Ham Short was a man with whom he could work profitably and well  --  he liked his style . As Daisy turned to be introduced to the Dempseys , he thought , another butterfly , pampered , petted , indulged , flattered and vain . The lesson of his ex-wife had been well learned . . . he knew the type . At dinner his judgment was confirmed as he listened to the conversation between Daisy , who was seated on his right , and Dave Hemming and Charlie Dempsey . " I 'll never forget seeing your father playing in a high goal tournament in Monterey in the thirties , " Charlie Dempsey said to Daisy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing at three with Eric Pedley from Santa Barbara playing one , Tommy Hitchcock at two and Winston Guest at four  --  greatest team ever mounted in my opinion . " " Nonsense , Charlie , " Dave Hemming interrupted from across the table . " The greatest team ever mounted was Guest , Cecil Smith , and Pedley , with Hitchcock at three  --  with all due respect to Stash . " " I 'm sure you 're both right , " Daisy smiled . " But nobody , not even Cecil Smith , could ride like my father . " She had grown accustomed to these conversations in the last few years . Almost every Horse Person over fifty had his own memories of her father , and she liked to hear them discuss him . . . it brought him back for a moment , even though they were talking of memories of very long ago , before she 'd been born . While the familiar argument went on , Daisy turned to Shannon . " Are you a polo aficionado , Mr. Shannon ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he answered . " That 's refreshing . " He thought she was mocking him . " And what do you do ,  | Princess Valensky , when you 're not arbitrating arcane disputes about a game that took place forty-five years ago ? " " Oh  --  this and that . I 'm sketching young Cindy this weekend , on her pony . " " For fun ? " " More or less . " Daisy considered it necessary at all times to hide the true commercial nature of her presence at these house parties . The fact that she was there to make money she had to have , the fact that she spent the evening carefully and casually finding out if any of her fellow guests had children who might be prospective subjects for her , the fact that she was doing nothing more or less than commission hunting , was best concealed by the mask of the dilettante . Her profession was well served by word of mouth rather than self-advertisement . " Do you hunt in the neighborhood , Mr. Shannon ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patrick thought . After one month of riding school how could anyone expect him to be jumping fences ? " Then where do you hunt ? " Daisy continued , confidently . " I do n't hunt at all , " Patrick said shortly . " But of course you do or did  --  no ? Oh , then why have you given it up ? " Shannon looked for malice in her eyes and found nothing but the gleam of candlelight on black velvet . The flames , the chrysanthemums on the table , the reflections from the heavy silver and Irish cut glass  --  all had become accomplices in illuminating her beauty which met and outmatched every brightness in the room . But he thought he heard a sardonic note in her amused interrogation . " I assure you that I do n't hunt , have never hunted and have no intention of ever hunting , " he answered her with a coldly reined-in courtesy . " But . . . your boots . . . " Daisy murmured , confused . " What about them ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No  --  I insist . What about my boots ? " Now he was certain that she was making fun of him . " Well , only . . . oh , it 's not important , really , it 's just silly of me to have noticed . . . " Daisy babbled , trying to avoid his eyes . " The boots ? " Patrick asked , implacably . Now Daisy got angry . If this man was going to treat her like a witness in a murder trial , she 'd jolly well speak up . " Mr. Shannon , your boots are black with brown tops . Only a  | Servant of the Hunt , that is a Hunt official , like a Whipper-In or the Master of the Hounds or the Master of the Hunt himself is entitled to wear boots like that . If you do n't hunt , your boots should be one solid color . " " The devil ! " " Someone should have told you , " she hastened to add . " Are n't you saying that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " " It 's really not important , " Daisy answered as coolly as possible . " You mean it 's not the done thing ' ? " he said , stingingly , venting his fury at Chuck Byers who had given him the boots without an explanation . " It 's unheard of , " she said , her temper rising . " Then why has n't anyone else said anything  --  I 've been out riding all day , " he accused her in a hard voice . " They assumed , as I did , that you hunted . It 's as simple as that . " " I do n't ride well enough for any rational person to imagine that I hunt , " he replied furiously . " Then perhaps they were being tactful , perhaps they guessed that you 'd get upset and they did n't want to risk your mighty wrath ? Why get angry at me , Mr. Shannon ? I did n't sell you those boots . " Daisy turned to Charlie Dempsey and started to talk polo to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the people he 'd ridden with today must have been curious about his boots and been too polite to question him  --  and , no doubt , had been laughing at him behind his back . Shannon did not enjoy feeling like a horse 's ass .  | There was only one private room in the Valarians ' apartment , only one room which had never been photographed in the course of Robin 's never-ending redecorations , which totally renewed the look of their Park Avenue duplex every two years . This was the room in which they spent their rare time together , in which they indulged in a cherished ritual before dressing to go out or to entertain at home as they did virtually every night of the week . Each evening at six o'clock Robin and Vanessa met in their private room which had walls and floors covered in thick carpeting the color of vicuna and a domed copper ceiling , from which warm light , glowing from hidden recesses , spread over the many orchids that grew in hanging baskets . In the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carpeted platform on which rested a gigantic oval hot tub  --  a tub as large as most ordinary bathrooms ? made of black fiberglass . Six inches deeper than tubs generally are , it had four adjustable water jets of brushed chrome that created whirlpools of water that could reach 110 degrees . Naked in the soothing water , their marvelously taut , superbly kept bodies glimmering , they lay and sipped cold , dry white wine , gossiping about their days and their doings . There they reaffirmed the deep bonds which held them together . Like many married homosexual couples they formed a stronger , more solid and durable relationship than almost any of the heterosexual couples they knew . There is no team so committed to their joint and individual successes as the homosexual husband happily married to a lesbian wife , no love match as tight and protective and closeknit . Together they , received immense benefits they could never have obtained outside of marriage , the most important of which was that l l ' protection from being single which leads , in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively speculation about their sexual preferences on the part of almost everybody who meets them . Together they formed that unit , " the married couple , " that is far more easily absorbed into social life anywhere than any single homosexual or a homosexual couple of the same sex : they provided  | their hostesses with that most desirable addition to any party , a perfectly matched pair . Together they made a traditional , infinitely secure home for each other , in which Robin was free to indulge his talent for creating resplendently baroque surroundings and ever more sumptuous flower arrangements . It was he who found and trained perfect servants , and Vanessa who planned the exquisitely thought-out parties she had used so effectively to promote Robin 's career . Finally , since they had no jealousy of each other , as lovers might have , each was free to indulge his sexual tastes with the added pleasure of knowing that the other was eagerly waiting to hear about it , to advise , to assist , to smooth the path , even to entrap , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them an entree into the mainstream of the establishment of society and wealth which would not have been possible on the same level had they remained single . As " the Valarians " they dined at the White House , sailed on the largest yachts , stayed in the most historic English and Irish country houses , an impeccable couple , above scandal , if not entirely above rumor ? but who paid attention to rumors in these days ? As " the Valarians " they were forever free of the taint of the homosexual ; as a married couple they moved with impunity in the widest world of celebrity , while , in their own inner circle , they were not only recognized as brilliantly successful deceivers , but applauded for their cleverness in finding each other and using each other so well . They had understood the secret , so rarely brought out in its raw and naked state ; the fact that among the successful of the world , there is no gender  --  there is only success or lack of success . The only important question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Homosexual married couples come in a variety of combinations : the bisexual husband , the kind Robin always called " a Jazz-Tango , " who in the first years of marriage occasionally enjoyed his wife and almost always produced astonishingly beautiful children ; the true homosexual man and the wife who is terrified of sex of any kind ; and the lesbian with the passive , almost neuter husband . The Valarians were of the variety that most certainly has the best stories to tell each other , since Robin was as active sexually as his wife . Robin Valarian truly loved Vanessa and she truly loved him , both with anxious tenderness . If he had a cold she brought him vitamin C every hour and watched while he swallowed it . If she had a tiring day , he would rub her back for an hour until she purred with relaxation and then he 'd go into the kitchen , tell the cook exactly what to put on a tray and bring it in himself , settling her among the  | cushions on the bed and insisting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living , growing , deeply rooted thing , totally dependent on their joint contributions . Vanessa often quoted Rilke : " The love that consists in this , that two solitudes protect , and border and salute each other . " Beyond love , they were each other 's best friends . Robin admired her nerve , her savage pursuit of what she wanted and he was particularly grateful for her role in his career . She had so much style , which leapt out directly from her personality , that she imparted it to his merely fashionable clothes . His abilities as a designer were limited : he knew how to make women look pretty and feminine  --  he specialized in cocktail and dinner dresses , leaning heavily on the allure of ruffles and the rustle of taffeta , but never in his life had he had an original design idea . Yet , year after year , rich women all over the country bought Robin Valarian 's expensive couture clothes . This came about only partly because of the exceptionally friendly way in which he was treated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties given by this most exclusive of couples . Essentially his clothes sold because Vanessa was so frequently photographed wearing his dresses with her swaggering , devil-bedamned flair , surrounded by people of taste and status , that " a Valarian " had come to mean a safely pretty dress in which an upperclass woman could feel almost as if she were Vanessa Valarian herself , rising to the challenge of being dashingly , ruthlessly , clashingly chic . Their duplex reflected the strength of their bond . It was not cupidity that made them load every table with precious bibelots , but the nesting instinct gone wild , castle building on a domestic scale . Every object they chose and bought together reaffirmed their commitment , a set of Pyrex mixing bowls as strongly as a costly silver mermaid fashioned by Tony Duquette . There was to them a sacredness about their table linen , their silver and china such as only newlyweds know . Long before it became fashionable for a man to be interested in domestic detail , Robin Valarian prided himself on his abilities as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parish , whose two watchwords were luxury and discipline , the Valarians believed in luxury and luxury . Every one of their down pillows was piped , or tasseled , every lampshade lined in pink silk , every curtain double-lined , looped and caparisoned , every wall rich with at least twelve costly coats of lacquer , when it was n't covered with rare fabric , every sofa overstuffed and oversized and totally comfortable , so that their guests felt as comforted and cocooned as if they were babies in their cribs , an illusion which caused them to  | gossip more freely than they ever did in less cushioned settings . The Valarians never gave a party at which at least one reputation was not made and another reputation ruined . This couple , who defended the fortress of their marriage with the rigorous loyalty of blood brothers , was spared the ambiguous changeable moods of lovers , escaped the predictable limits imposed by monogamy and enjoyed all of the privileges granted to matrimony . Vanessa Valarian was a subtle and devoted practitioner of the art of doing favors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done for the right person at the right time , done without planned motive or direct expectation of reciprocity , would eventually prove to be a useful , even an essential piece of the superb mosaic of her life ... caviar flung on the waters . The right time was , in her experience , when the person for whom she did the favor had no reason to expect anything of her , when the favor seemed to come straight from good-hearted open-handedness and appreciation of that person 's rare qualities . She almost never did favors for anyone who came to her for one ; her favors had to appear as unhoped-for and unforgettable . The person for whom she did a favor needed no recommendation aside from Vanessa 's keen intuition that told her who was coming up and who was going down , who would make it , who had potential that had n't been detected , and who was n't worth bothering with . Like an expert surfer , she was able to detect the big waves before they gathered momentum , able to hop on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling and the power . When Topsy Short had mentioned that Daisy Valensky was sketching Cindy as a sort of trial before Topsy made up her mind about commissioning an oil of all three girls on their ponies , Vanessa felt the tingle of opportunity . She had observed Daisy the evening before at dinner . She had known instantly , as no one else did , that the green Schiaparelli suit was almost forty years old and that the emeralds were false and that the girl was , in some way or another , vulnerable . How she could possibly be vulnerable in light of her title , her share of her father 's presumably fabulous fortune and her beauty was inexplicable , but Vanessa knew . " Why do n't we look at her sketches before she goes back to New York , " she suggested . " Oh , I do n't think she 'd like it , " Topsy answered . " She told me when I asked her to come that they 'd just he rough studies , like shorthand notes . She 'll send me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does it matter what she likes , young Topsy ? Let 's have a peek  --  it might be amusing . " Reluctantly Daisy allowed the two women to see her sketch pad . There were dozens of rapid , bold line drawings but none of them could convey to a nonprofessional what the finished sketch would be like . Topsy was silent , her disappointment visible on her face , but Vanessa instantly grasped the extent of Daisy 's talent . " You 're good  --  but of course you know that , " she said to Daisy . " Topsy , you 'd be making the mistake of the year if you do n't have Princess Daisy paint all three of your girls . In a few years you 'll have to pay twice the price for anything she does  --  if she even has the time for you . " " Well . . . I 'm just not sure  --  what if Ham does n't like it ? " Topsy looked at Vanessa adoringly . How could she be interested in making decisions about paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked thighs rubbing softly together , aching , trembling for the touch of Vanessa 's marvelous hands ? " I ca n't imagine anything he 'd like more , and if you do n't do it now  --  Topsy , pay attention ! ? you wo n't have a record of the girls before they start to grow up  --  they 're just at that perfect age . If I were you I would n't hesitate for a second . I 'd have a really big oil , an heirloom . . . that is , " she said , looking at Daisy , " if you have time to take on such a job ? " " I could make time , " Daisy said , thinking that she 'd paint all night for a month if necessary to get it done before the next bill came from England . " Well , then , that 's settled . I 've done you a great favor , Topsy , and I do n't want you to forget it . You 'll bless me someday . " " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hidden relief on Daisy 's face . So , she needed money after all . Curious . " Thank me ? Topsy 's the one who should thank me  --  she 's damn lucky to get you , " Vanessa answered with the guileless , great , open smile that accompanied the execution of a promising favor that every instinct told her to grant . Daisy Valensky was now in her debt . " The next time we 're in England , I 'm going to tell Ram just how talented I think you are . He 's a great friend of ours  --  we 're devoted to your brother . " " Thank you , Mrs. Valarian , " Daisy said again , automatically . She felt a chill like a stain spreading over her heart .  | " What you need , Luke Hammerstein , " Kiki announced sweetly , " is someone to wreak havoc with your life . " " That last exhibition just about did it for me , " Luke answered as they found a table in The Ballroom . " I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quebec manhole-cover rubbings ? " " It was a definite first . I 've been curious about them as far back as grade school . And I like the fact that the group who did them is making rubbings from the manhole covers in SoHo to show in Quebec . It 's that kind of cultural exchange that may do something to help the uncertain relationship we 've always had with Canada . " " Yeah  --  I worry about Canada a lot . " " Do you ? " " Naturally . There 's a tunnel in the heart of downtown Detroit which takes you right into Canada . When my brothers and I were kids we used to pester our father to take us . It sounded so romantic . " " Was it ? " " Of course not  --  that just proves that you know nothing about Detroit . . . or Canada . " " We ca n't all get lucky . " " You 're making fun of me again , " said Kiki , her eyebrows , with their jubilant angles , rising toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry but I ca n't help it . You 're like Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing  --  remember , she was born in a merry hour ' ? " " Well , did she get the guy in the end ? " " You never stop , do you ? " Luke Hammerstein had been pursued by females since he was twelve , but never had he met one as frank about her intentions as Kiki Kavanaugh . Was she a compendium of every craft and guile known to women , or was she what she presented herself to be , an innocent sensualist out to have a thoroughly good time  --  with him as a partner ? Luke was used to the new breed of women , but Kiki was a Green Beret in the battle of the sexes . It put him off balance , he admitted to himself . He was actually playing hard to get , like a woman was supposed to do  --  this role-reversal stuff was kind of fun . " Get me a drink , for God 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were both carrying baskets loaded with the afternoon 's purchases . " Have you ever had hard cider ? " Kiki asked . It was her favorite next to the iced Irish Coffee . " Not yet , but why do n't you order it since you 're obviously going to anyway . "  | He looked in mild exasperation at the baskets they 'd deposited on the white tiled floor . Kiki had bought , if he remembered correctly , an appliqued apricot satin cover for a hot-water bottle at a store called Harriet Love , a sculpture of a green frog , done entirely in neon tubing at a gallery called Let There Be Neon , two black satin garments , ambiguously called " guest kimonos , " two bottles of Soave Bona and one of Wild Turkey bourbon at a liquor store which had , in its window , a sign announcing WE DO NOT HAVE PINT BOTTLES OF WINE , and a piece of jewelry which made him nervous , an ivory heart with a red stone hanging from it like a drop of blood . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one was called " They 've Been Kicking My Heart Around . " And that was n't counting what she 'd bought at Dean and Deluca , the great gourmet grocery store , where overflowing baskets of garlic buds , apples , lemons , black radishes , walnuts and plummy dried yuccas stood decoratively in the doorway and expensive pots and pans hung from the skylight two stories above . There she 'd gone wild . Slabs of pate en croute and duck gallantine , both at over twelve dollars a pound , from a counter on which two dozen different pates were displayed ; a jar of heather honey from Holland ; whipped cream cheese and a Petit St. Marcellin , the small cheese wrapped in chestnut leaves ; three different kinds of salami , one from Spain , one from Italy and one from France ; a pound of smoked Scotch salmon ; a jar of hot okra pickles ; a pound of Black Forest Ham ; a dozen freshly baked croissants ; half of a perfect brie ; and , from the baskets of bread which hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challah , four bagels and one loaf of dark pumpernickel . Then she 'd added a box of Dovedale Butter Shortbread from an English company which had been established in 1707 , and several bars of bittersweet chocolate from the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company in San Leandro , California . There was something about the combination of foods she 'd bought which struck him as highly suggestive . Luke had been to SoHo a number of times before , since no advertising man he knew would miss the opportunity to see the big new works that were displayed in the galleries ; but mainly he 'd stuck to quick visits to 420 Broadway , where the major uptown dealers had their downtown branches : Leo Castelli , Sonnabend and Andre Emmerich . Today he 'd seen a SoHo he 'd overlooked , the SoHo of people who actually lived here , a SoHo in which the Porcelli Brothers displayed fresh honeycomb tripe in the window of their butcher shop ;  | in which a little kid walking a bike had stopped Kiki at a corner and asked , " Miss , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign proclaiming PERSIAN CAT FOUND was displayed in the window of the M and D Grocery , a shabby , old-fashioned store which nevertheless had a freezer full of expensive Haagen-Dazs ice cream and shelves on which salted nuts shared the space with religious pictures and ten kinds of yogurt ; a SoHo where , in the Mandala Workshop , you could buy a symbol representing the Jungian effort to reunify the self , made of hand crochet and stained glass . This SoHo was one of exotic contrasts . J. Volpe , General Machinist , was next door to a gallery which offered prints of " erotic food " ; stores selling plumbing supplies and the A and P Cordage Co. existed cheek to jowl with the Jack Gallery with its Erte and Jean Cocteau watercolors . Kiki looked at Luke shrewdly . He was in SoHo shock . . . she knew the signs . She had planned to have dinner at The Ballroom but the enormous mural on the wall opposite their table would only intensify his discomfort , showing as it did , in vivid photo-realist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , including Larry Rivers and Robert Indiana . " I know what you need , " she told Luke . " Now what ? " " Chinese food . " " By God , you 're right ! It 's the only thing I could eat . How did you know ? " " You 're Jewish  --  it 's simple  --  when Jews go into culture shock the only thing that brings them back is deli or Chinese . We gentiles feel better right away if we just sit around and watch white bread burning . " " Do n't you mean toasting ? " he asked limply . " No , burning , like a Yule log . Come on , we 'll go to the Oh-HoSo . It 's right across the street . " Since no one had yet taken their order they unceremoniously picked up their baskets , left The Ballroom , crossed the street and staggered into the bar at the Chinese restaurant : a most welcoming bar crowded with worn , green velvet loveseats and chairs of carved wood , no two alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clutter of Victorian leftovers and , when the Victoriana failed , battered sewing-machine tables . In the light of the juke box , Kiki 's umber eyes were shot with sparks of opals , yellow diamonds and glee . " The gentleman will have a double Wild Turkey on the rocks , "  | she told the waiter , " and I 'll have some hard cider . Now let 's talk about the other night . Why did n't you want to make love ? Were you really too tired ? " she asked Luke , with her bawdiest smile . " Shit  --  just when you start to coddle me , like a real woman , you turn all aggressive . Wait till after the egg roll , wo n't you ? " " All I meant was I was n't too tired  --  and I 'd had to handle Theseus all day . So how come ? Are you shy . . . do you wait till the third date  --  have you religious scruples ? " " After the egg roll , " he reminded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fully aware of his forces , so he did n't mind revealing his weaknesses . He 'd never met the woman who was a match for him  --  it was his secret pride . Three older sisters had taught him more about women than he needed to know , he had once liked to say , although he was aware that those had become fighting words in recent years . He saw Kiki sizing him up with the skill of a Monte Carlo croupier , no , make that a pit boss in Vegas . He smiled at her faintly , tauntingly . " You know what you remind me of ? " she said heatedly . " Those crypto-Greek heads in the Met from five hundred B.c. ? they all have the same smug , superior , secretive smile  --  not even the decency to pretend to be honest  --  total conceit that has lasted for three thousand years . " " After the egg roll . " " All right  --  but then  --  watch out ! " " Do you always warn your intended victims ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many ways , more fragile than women . " Luke sighed , looking , giving Kiki the feeling that he was like nothing so much as a whole pile of presents that she was itching to unwrap . " Okay , we 'll talk about other people . Tell me about your mother , " Kiki suggested . " My mother is an arch-conservative . She never redecorates . We still have art deco . " " My mother redecorates every year . We 're just getting art deco . " " My mother warned me that if I ever marry a beautiful gentile girl , one day she 'll turn out to be just another old shiksa  --  shiksa is the only Yiddish word she knows . " " My mother believes that the way to break in a sable coat is to wear it to a Japanese restaurant the first day it comes from the furrier . She orders sukiyaki cooked at the table , and sits in the coat during the whole meal . It takes about a week to air it out , but after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also I think she 's an anti-Semite . " " My mother is such an anti-Semite that when her club started letting in Russian Jews , instead of only German Jews , she left it . " " My mother 's worse than that . She took a course in mouth-tomouth resuscitation in case my father ever got a heart attack and then , when she was in a bank , a man had a heart attack right in front of her and she did n't try to save him because he was so repulsive looking she was afraid of catching whatever he might have had .. . and he died right there in front of her . " " Jesus ! Did she really ? " Luke said , fascinated . Kiki was winning the mother-game . " No , but it did happen to her real-estate lady , " Kiki admitted . " My mother does n't have real-estate ladies , " Luke said with a cool smile . " Do n't you ever move ? You have to have a real-estate lady to buy a house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nouveau . She just has ... " " The apartment on Park Avenue and the house in . . . Pound Ridge . . . and the place in Westhampton  --  no , Easthampton ? right ? " " Almost  --  how 'd you get so close ? " " It figured . I think we have the same mother only they do n't know it . " " Do you realize , " Luke said moodily , " that five times more people buy pet food than buy baby food ? Is n't that horrifying ? " " No , dummy . It 's because babies grow up and start to eat like people but pets eat pet food all of their lives . " " You 're not entirely stupid , " Luke said , reluctantly . Most people reacted to the pet-food statistics with dependable indignation . " Do you want to hold hands ? " Kiki asked hopefully . " Not during lobster Cantonese ! " he said scandalized . " You lack passion , " Kiki warned , looking yearningly at his mouth  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mustache and a beard , which made it so much more edible looking than if it just sat there on his face surrounded by skin . " You 're just saying that to make me prove to you that I 'm not boring . It wo n't work . " Luke applied himself to his lobster with calm relish . Kiki looked at him in dismay . This was n't going right at all . Most men , in her large experience , had no defenses against a wellmounted , absolutely shameless attack . Bewildered , confused , flattered , they fell for it , and once they 'd fallen for the idea they were  | only a step away from falling for her . Luke made her uneasy . . . she had the feeling that somewhere she 'd gotten her act wrong , but she 'd started out with him as she had with dozens of others and now the pattern had been set . Maybe he was just hungry . Maybe he had just been tired . With Daisy away for the weekend , and the provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lots of time to work on this unexpectedly stubborn customer . She really had to have him . " Could you please bring us some hot tea , " she asked a passing waiter , " and some optimistic fortune cookies ? " The Friday following her weekend in Middleburg , Daisy found the studio unexpectedly peaceful . North had gone off for a week 's vacation , the first in over a year , so there was no production meeting scheduled until the middle of the next week . There were a myriad of details for her to check in the office , but she was pleased when Nickthe-Greek and Wingo Sparks invited her to have lunch with them . Normally she ate lunch at her desk , with a sandwich in one hand and the phone in another . Once the waiter had brought them their food , Nick said casually , " So how 's the job going , kid ? You holding up all right ? I mean , we all know it is n't easy working for North . Sometimes I get the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's not exactly given to praise , but when he does n't foam at the mouth , I know I 've done a good job , " Daisy shrugged . " So you 're willing to settle for that kind of validation ? " Wingo asked . " Why not ? Is there something wrong with that ? " Daisy was n't about to complain to her coworkers . " Lots wrong , " said Nick . " It 's like being satisfied with crumbs from a rich man 's table , campesina , and I , Nick-the-Greek , am here to tell you that in no way is it enough . " " What are you trying to start , Nick ? " Daisy asked curiously . " You get your commissions and they 're hardly crumbs . " " You want to tell her , Wingo ? " Nick asked the young cameraman . " You bet I do . Listen , Daisy , Nick and I have been talking . We both think that we could go into business for ourselves . Nick 's the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts are who want the North look but do n't want to pay North 's prices . North thinks of me as just a cameraman , but I can do his stuff , too  --  lots of guys are director-cameramen . It took me five years to get my cameraman 's  | card  --  but I could be a director tomorrow just by saying I 'm one . And I 'm good ? " " How do you know ? " Daisy challenged . " I 've been watching him long enough  --  I 'm on to his tricks .. . and face it , how hard is it to direct a commercial ? " " This is what we have in mind , " Nick interrupted Wingo . " We want to start our own shop but we want you with us . . . as a partner and producer . You would n't have to invest a dime , but you 'd get a third share in the profits . Once I 'm free of North , I could go out and sell Wingo  --  I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you is because you happen to be the best producer anywhere ? you work harder , you can talk people into doing anything for you , you watch the money as if it were your own , you double check everything  --  so , lucky lady , you get a free ride on this deal . " " You and Wingo and I would just up and leave  --  taking the store with us ? " Daisy asked . " It would n't be exactly that , " Wingo protested . " North could replace each of us . . . eventually . . . nobody 's indispensable . " " Yes , eventually  --  but meanwhile he 'd be crippled for how long ? You 're talking rip-off , Nick , " Daisy said , in growing anger . " Tough shit , " Nick said , carelessly . " This is a rip-off business . " " Nick , " Daisy asked , " who gave you your first chance at repping  --  who took you out of that ad agency and taught you the ropes ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose your natural chutzpah and okayed your expense accounts for those first months when you were getting nowhere ? North , right ? And Wingo , just who the hell hired you on a regular basis instead of using a free-lance cameraman like almost everyone else ? How many days a year would you be working if you were merely another free lance ? And who was the only person willing to take a chance on a kid who had just gotten his card ? Most directors go for experience  --  they do n't want to touch a raw kid . . . too much trouble . And how come you think you 're such a hot-shot director when all you know is what you 've seen North do ? Do n't you understand that you do n't know why he does it , or how he gets his ideas ? Perfect proof is that you think it 's easy to direct a commercial  --  maybe it is  --  a bad commercial or even a fair commercial . But a good commercial ? A commercial you do n't absolutely hate when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't make you want to vomit with the sheer banality of it ? A commercial that looks so good you remember it a week later ? Or even a month later , when you 've seen thousands of others since ? What 's more , you do n't know word one about casting .  | Alix and I only make a selection of possibilities , North does all the final casting and that 's essential to the success of a commercial . " " Shit , Daisy , if you 're going to talk about loyalty . . . " Nick interrupted in disgust . " You 're goddamned right I 'm talking about loyalty . I remember the time you got drunk and came on so crudely with that gal art director from BBD and 0 that we lost the job , and I remember the time you were so anxious to get those big beer spots that you gave them a Y and R firm bid without checking with Arnie and we lost money every day we worked , and I remember the time  --  or rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of client interference and you showed up too late to take them to lunch and get them out of his hair for a few hours , and I remember ... " " Shut the fuck up , Daisy , " Nick said , looking sick . " The hell I will ? My point is that all those times North got furious , but he did n't go looking for another rep  --  he stuck to you because he had a commitment to you and you 're more good than you are bad  --  but when you 're bad , you 're horrid ! " " But North 's so rude to you . . . " Wingo started , defensively . " That 's my problem , " she snapped , " and I do n't need your sympathy . He 's rude because he never works any way but under tension . There is n't a minute that the time pressure is n't getting to him . If somebody can screw up , somebody will screw up . . . and he knows it . It 's my business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing personal in his rudeness  --  I 'm an extension of his work and he does n't need to play Sir Walter Raleigh with me . As a matter of fact , you two are only extensions of his work , too . Nick , if you were n't selling North , you just might have to work for a living . Wingo , if you did n't have North checking each shot before you roll a foot of film , I wonder just what your work would be like ? You 've both had a good ride on his back . I 'm not saying you do n't have talent , Wingo  --  just that you are n't ready to be a director-cameraman yet , and that for you and Nick to get together behind his back and try to steal off with everything he 's given you both in terms of learning and experience and confidence  --  and to try to get me to go with you ? that 's the lowest kind of ingratitude ! " " Nick , " Wingo said nastily , " we 've obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . she just has n't got what it takes to go out on her own . Daisy , you wo n't get a chance like this again . " " Maybe next time somebody will ask me to rob a bank . . . who knows , I could get lucky . Now listen , you two masterminds , I have n't had one bite yet of this lunch you invited me to and I 'm not hungry  | anymore . I 'm going back to the studio and work . As far as I 'm concerned this perfectly splendid meeting never took place . You did n't ask me about anything and I did n't tell you how I felt . Whatever you decide to do is up to you . I 've forgotten the whole thing . Personally I hope we 'll be together for a long time . We 're not a bad team  --  all of us . Or , on the other hand , if you do leave , good luck ! I predict many wonderful days for the two of you shooting the attack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daisy left , Nick looked at Wingo . " I wish I could say she 's a bitch . " Wingo 's face was that of a man who had just missed being run over by a bus . " You ca n't and neither can I. I just wish I could say she was wrong . When Daisy got back to her apartment that night she found Kiki thumbing through an issue of the SoHo Weekly News . " Daisy , do you have a date tomorrow night ? " " You know I do  --  your cousin is coming to town to take me out for dinner . " " Oh , right , I 'd forgotten . . . so he has n't given up on you yet , huh ? " " Henry ? I do n't think he understands English . I 've said no so many times it 's boring , but , my God , he 's persistent . He 's so sweet I do n't want to hurt his feelings . I keep telling him he should n't see me because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it would be kinder to whack it off with one quick stroke  --  sorry , Theseus darling  --  but he wo n't pay any attention . Why 'd you ask ? " " Oh , I just thought we might do something  --  there 's a tap dance epic at the Performing Garage and a poetry reading at St. Mark 's Church and La Mama is doing Brecht for a change and there 's Microwave Music at Three Mercer  --  all kinds of things , " Kiki said glumly . " Christ ! What 's the matter ? Have you taken your temperature ? Where does it hurt ? " Daisy said , looking at her friend with concern . Kiki was curled up on the couch in an old caftan , surrounded by scripts , letters and magazines . " Do n't be an ass  --  there 's nothing wrong with me  --  I just thought we should seriously invest in a little cultural enrichment , that 's all . I have my theater , even if it is temporarily dark , but you , what do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making millions of women have anxiety attacks ? " Kiki asked  | waspishly . " That , plus those Horse People will make you a cultural idiot if you 're not careful . " " Let 's just stick to the facts , " Daisy said , ignoring her words . " You 've never gone in for cultural enrichment since Santa Cruz misguidedly gave you a diploma . That means you do n't have a date for Friday night for the first time in something like eight years , and you 're in a panic . Now that 's absurd and you know it . There are a dozen guys you could call who 'd jump . . . " " I do n't want them ! " Kiki said , sounding more confused than adamant . " Who do you want ? " Kiki remained stubbornly mute . " Shall we play guessing games ? Who is it my Kiki wants ? Who did she fill the fridge for last Saturday so that we had to eat pate and cheese for breakfast all week long to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stop it , Daisy ! You 're getting so rotten , " Kiki snarled . " Luke still has n't called , " Daisy said flatly . " No , he has n't . I 'd like to kill him . How dare he do this to me ? I simply do n't understand it ! Nobody does this to me , nobody ! " Kiki 's whole little body was huddled and shivering under the caftan as if she were preventing herself from springing forward and pounding her fists on the floor like a baby in a tantrum . " Nobody but Luke Hammerstein . " " That 's right , rub it in , " Kiki said bitterly . " Kiki , come on , I 'm sympathetic ! But you have to face facts if you want to change them . " " Oh , spare me  --  Miss Lonely Hearts rides again . " " Do you know somebody else you can talk about it with ? " " Daisy Valensky , you have the makings of a first-class bitch somewhere inside that glorious exterior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizing Theseus in a despairing embrace . " I think you 're right , " Daisy said with a pleased smile . " This is my day for telling it like it is or some such slogan left over from  --  was it the fifties or the sixties ? ? never mind . . . but you 're not the first person who is n't happy with me today . And guess what  --  I do n't give a shit . " " Oh , be quiet and listen . That son-of-a-bitch has refused my advances , not once but twice . How can there be any possible excuse for that ? Do you think he 's impotent ? Do you think maybe he has an incurable form of some kind of V.D. and does n't want to tell me ? Do  | you think . . . oh , God . . . do you think he 's in love with somebody ? Oh , Jesus . . . I bet that 's what it is  --  that 's the only thing it could be ! " Kiki 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst of all possibilities . " If he were , I 'd know it . He and North are tight  --  I 'd have picked up something , somehow  --  that studio is like a commune , gossip like that would have zipped around by now . Kiki , it 's simple , and you brought it all on yourself . " The phone rang and Daisy picked it up . " Hi . Oh , hi , Luke , it 's Daisy . " Kiki lunged for the phone but Daisy backed away holding it firmly on its long cord . " Nope , sorry , she 's not here . No idea .. . could be any one of a dozen places . . . I have n't really seen her all week , to tell you the truth , except running in and running out .. . but I 'll take a message . " Kiki signaled frantically but Daisy made horrible grimaces and ferocious eyes at her while she shook her free hand menacingly back and forth . " All right  --  I 'll ask her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll leave it on the top of her other messages . . . I 'm beginning to feel like a switchboard . I do n't know why Kiki does n't get a service or something . No , that 's all right . . . I do n't really mind . . . at least you 're a client which is more than I can say for all of the others . Bye , Luke . " " Daisy ! How could you ? " Kiki cried as soon as she 'd hung up . " That 's how you do it ! " " You 've got to be joking . That 's the oldest game in the book . Nobody does that anymore . " " Everybody does that who has the sense she 's born with . Too bad you did n't know Anabel better . " " But I 've never played hard-to-get in my life , " Kiki sputtered , " and I 've had more men than anyone I 've ever known . " " Men you were not really after . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want him . I 've seen you in operation for years ; everything made easy for the poor sucker , and he walks right into your big , beautiful spiderwebs , thinking how he 's made a conquest , and before he knows what 's happened , he 's a goner because right at the heart of your whole number is the fact that you simply could n't care less  --  you 're just doing it for kicks , a slap and a tickle , and he senses this , subconsciously anyway , and that 's what drives him crazy , not your availability but your essential unavailability . I defy you to name just one man you 've had whom you did n't give up if someone more attractive came along . . . I defy you to tell me the name of one guy who made you suffer . . . up till now , "  | " Why should I let a man make me suffer ? What 's so good about that ? " sniffed Kiki rebelliously . " Nothing . Suffering is n't noble . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a position where you might have had to suffer is what I 'm talking about . You 've always gone in for basically unimportant relationships ; good sex , lots of laughs , but not meaningful , ' if you can overlook that cliche . Sorry , sorry , but it 's true and you know it , too . Now , along comes a man who could be important to you and you have n't got any idea how to approach him . You 're putting on your old act with a new cast and it just is n't working . So try a new script . Luke is smarter than you are , hard as that may be for you to believe . He 's got you figured out , he can tell that you 're used to having your way with men , and he is n't going to let that happen to him . What else is he doing but playing hard to get with you ? He waited five days to call ? Well , you 're not going to return his call for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do see him again , you 're going to be a whole new Kiki . " " It 's too late , I 've already blown it , " Kiki said dismally . " I mean I really let him know I could be had . . . and all that food ! I could cut my throat ! And , Daisy , I do adore him so ... " " First impressions can be changed . You 're an actress , are n't you ? It 's simple  --  you threw yourself at him because you had nothing better to do that particular week . But , since then , things have changed . Do n't ever be specific about what has changed  --  he 'll imagine them . Now you 're not interested in getting involved . You 're cool , restrained and maddeningly off-hand . You ca n't accept the first two times he asks you out but you leave the door open  --  you 're friendly  --  in fact , it 's as if the two first encounters had just never taken place . But do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Let him try to figure that one out ! I think they call it bait and switch . " " I think they call it entrapment , " Kiki murmured , radiant with admiration . " Daisy  --  I can do it  --  I know I can . But what if it does n't work ? " " Then you 'll just have to resign yourself . It 's better to know right away than to find out after you 've turned yourself inside out for months over the guy . Men have died from time to time , and worms have eaten them , but not for love . " " Betty Friedan ? " " Shakespeare  --  As You Like It . " " Oh , what did he know . Dost thou think , because thou art virtuous , there shall he no more cakes and ale ? ' " I knew you did n't need cultural enrichment. "  | " I put on Twelfth Night last year  --  do n't you remember  --  on skateboards ? " " Could anyone who had the good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't stand eating any more of last Saturday 's gourmet leftovers . Let 's go get a pizza as soon as I 've cleaned up a bit . All right ? " " You 're on . " Kiki was already pacing the room like an oversized elf , holding herself tall , with an elusive , faintly amused , slightly preoccupied expression on her face and her body clearly expressing " touch-me-not . " Daisy flung her a fond look and left the living room quietly . When Kiki was getting into a character she liked to be alone . Daisy deliberately took her time washing her hands and suddenly she found herself plummeted from the peaks of the day into another of those strange pockets of sadness she had experienced only a week before , in Middleburg , at the Shorts . She 'd been flying high all day today , telling Wingo and Nick-the-Greek what she thought of their sneaky plan and now straightening out Kiki . But abruptly , face to face with herself , her life seemed , in a frightening way , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did n't form anything as substantial as a quilt . Her work at the studio , difficult though it was , did n't have the virtue of continuity ; with every new commercial the achievements , the triumphant struggle of the week before were immediately replaced by today 's crisis . North 's lack of anger was not really a substitute for genuine appreciation , no matter what she 'd told the others at lunch . She felt that she was forever playing catch-up on the job , always having to prove herself , over and over . As for her painting : her scramble after commissions was at the whim of capricious patrons who often treated her sketches and watercolors as just one step higher than a professional photographer 's studio portrait . And her raggedy excuse for a love life was even more unfulfilling than she 'd admitted to Kiki . The reason she could sound so wise on the matter of Kiki 's refusal to he vulnerable was because it was a trait she knew all too well , an element that was far more deeply established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The idea of spending another evening fending off poor , dear , damp-minded Henry Kavanaugh was dreary . She should never have let him make love to her in the first place . She had never been in love  --  it was as simple and bare as that , and a constant source of uneasiness and depression , like a low-grade fever which would not go down . She thought of Kiki , practicing being hard-to-get in the other room  --  that was the one constant in her life , her friendship with that great , good loony . Nothing she  | could ever do for Kiki would pay her back for all the emotional support and unswerving affection she 'd given Daisy in the years since her father had died . Theseus padded into the bathroom and sensed her mood . He put his front paws on her shoulders , just as he used to do when she was little , and licked her nose . " You lovely lurcher , you , " Daisy told him and realized that she was crying . He was licking up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you go around as if you have the answers for the whole world , so just stop feeling sorry for yourself . Enough ! You 're doing fine . . . just keep on truckin ' .  | Hello , Ham ? " " Yup ? " " It 's Pat Shannon  --  how 's it going ? " " Could n't be better , " Ham Short grinned . The one who phones first in the mating dance of companies and corporations has put his cards on the table . And he liked a man who made his own phone calls . Nothing offended him as much as having another man 's secretary get him on the line and keep him waiting until she put him through to her boss . He invariably hung up on her , unless , of course , he wanted something . " How about coming up to New York , whenever it 's convenient , and spending the day with me at Supracorp ? I 'd like you to know more about us . " " How 's tomorrow ? " " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " " The hell you will  --  I only fly in my own Aero-Commander .. . got it fixed up the way I like it . " " Western ? " " Damn right  --  the thing 's got everything but its own still and an outside crapper . " " A car and driver will be waiting for you . When will you get in ? " " Nine sharp , give or take an hour waiting for landing clearance . " " See you tomorrow . I 'm looking forward to it . " " You bet . " Supracorp 's New York offices occupied five full floors at 630 Fifth Avenue , where the great bronze statue of Atlas , bearing the globe on his shoulders , guards the enormous doors . Ham Short stepped out of the elevator on the tenth floor to find himself in a world designed by Everett Brown to combine drama with rich spaciousness . The receptionist sat behind a twenty-foot semicircular desk made from glowing white oak which curved in front of a wall of bronze mirrors . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-  | standing columns of plexiglass and stainless steel in which were displayed examples of Supracorp 's products . Ham gave his name to the receptionist and turned to inspect the columns . Before two minutes had passed , he was gratified and surprised to see Pat Shannon , in shirtsleeves , the knot of his tie off center and the top button of his shirt undone , appear to greet him . They passed through wide corridors carpeted in deep brown , so well lit and humming with invisible energy that Ham felt as if he were on a spaceship . Shannon ushered him through a large room with yellow linen walls in which three women were busily telephoning or typing , each at her own large rosewood desk , and on into his own office . Ham , anticipating an expansion of the refined , subdued , but unembarrassed opulence he had just glimpsed , was astonished to find himself in a room which could have been in a ranch house in Santa Fe . Shannon gestured toward a pair of deeply tufted , pleasantly worn leather chairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stood on a low pine table . " What 's this ? Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations ? " Short asked . The lines on either side of Shannon 's mouth deepened in amusement . " Beats the hell out of me how a man can get a day 's work done in a jacket . As for the three generations  --  I 'll never know . You 're looking at a genuine orphan , Ham . " " Do n't look to me for a drop of sympathy . I left home at twelve  --  always wished I 'd been an orphan . Still do  --  I 'm supporting two dozen no-goods back in Arkansas , Ham said , still inspecting the room . The walls were simply painted in a calm , pale gray . It was sparely furnished with a few mellow , not exceptional pieces of pine furniture , and several Navaho rugs were hung on the walls . The floor was covered with adobe tile . It was so clearly a room that had been designed by the man who used it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed . This lack of pretension was more meaningful than the most magnificent office would have been . There was n't even any art  --  only a few large chunks of quartz and a number of American Indian blankets . Ham , looking through three big , uncurtained windows at a startling view of the spires of St. Patrick 's Cathedral directly across the street , thought that this had to be one of the most expensive pieces of office space in the world . " How much do you know about Supracorp , Ham ? " Pat Shannon looked even younger than he had in Middleburg . The informality of his open shirt , the obvious comfort he took in his old chair , the lack of any attempt to disguise his intensity , his focus on I lam Short , the  | glint of playfulness in his eyes , all made Ham feel as if he were meeting a good friend rather than someone with whom he was merely having an exploratory business discussion . He remembered , looking at Patrick 's muscular neck and the big , hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hell of a linebacker when he 'd played for Tulane . Ham Short felt very much at ease . " Only what I read in the Wall Street Journal . Not a tenth of what you fellas must have found out about my little outfit . " " You and your outfit interest us a lot , Ham . " " I gather so . How come you picked on me ? " Short was quite as wary as he was flattered . " Obviously we want to get into shopping malls . We already have a real-estate division and it 's healthy and growing . There are many real-estate operations we could be interested in besides yours . But it 's Ham Short we want to acquire , as much , and , in fact , more than your property . We admire the way you 've built your business , we like your brains , we like your methods , we like the way you operate and we like your results . We need a man like you . " " Do n't beat about the bush much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . A lengthy courtship is n't necessary when two people want the same thing . But there 's no point in talking specifics unless you 're interested as well , and that 's why I asked you up to visit  --  to show you what we 're about . If we bought your company , Ham , you 'd not only double your net worth within a few years , as one of the largest single stockholders in Supracorp , but you 'd be on our board of directors and we 'd be able to get the benefit of your thinking in operating all of our various divisions . Hell , Ham , we 'd pick your brains like a bunch of vultures . And , of course , you 'd continue to run your own show with the advantage of our lines of credit and the profits we 're sitting on , ready to invest . " " Reporting to you ? " Short said flatly . " Yes . And I report to the stockholders . I do n't believe you and I would have problems getting along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had never reported to anyone in his life . Still , he had always been intrigued by the activities of the large , varied conglomerates . He felt he was ready to spread his wings over a great deal more space than that covered by mere shopping malls . " Come on  --  let 's take a walk around . " Pat Shannon knew just how hitter a pill he 'd just given Short to chew on and he did n't want to leave him too much time to taste it . On the other hand , it had to be said , ind the sooner the better . There was only room for one man  | at the top . He led Ham out of his office , this time stopping briefly to introduce Short to his three secretaries . " Some of our divisions are based here , " Shannon explained as they walked on down the corridor . " Lexington Pharmaceuticals , which was Nat Temple 's first baby , has its main office on the next floor up  --  did you ever hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cough drop ? Nat Temple cooked it up on his mother 's wood-burning stove and was the first person to give the Smith Brothers real competition . Now Lexington makes everything from miracle drugs to . . . Hi , Jim . " Shannon stopped a man passing in the hall . " Ham , this is Jim Golden , one of the vice-presidents of Lexington Pharmaceuticals . Jim , Hamilton Short . " " Mr. Short , it 's a pleasure . Pat , how was Paris ? When 'd you get back ? " " Yesterday . And Paris was as usual  --  two full days of meetings . Choiseul and O'Hara , our wine and liquor importing division , is based there , " he explained to Ham . " For every one taste of the new vintages I must have had a bottle of water . We 're looking to buy a big natural source water but the one I liked best was n't for sale  --  belongs to the government . " " No jet lag ? " Ham asked , with curiosity . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches on New York time when I get there and stay on New York time until I leave , so it does n't hit me . It 's a necessity . Yesterday , only hours after I got back , I was the guest speaker at the New York Society of Security Analysts , and last night was the opening of a Broadway musical to which we own the movie rights , and I 'd invited a few senators and their wives up from Washington , so I had to be awake . " " But what about meals ? Do n't your French people get mixed up ? " " They 're used to it by now . They do n't complain so I assume they do n't mind . When I fly to Japan  --  we have four hundred people in the office there  --  I do the same thing . " " And they do n't complain either ? " Ham asked , looking suspicious . " Not so you 'd notice . But I do n't stay more than three days at a time  --  they manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communications . It 's our entertainment division . The film studio and the television production company are both based on the Coast , of course , but the paperback publishing house is right here , two floors up , and the main offices for our seven radio stations and our TV stations are in this  | building too . Next year we 're thinking of getting into hardcover publishing . " " I thought publishing was strictly a gentleman 's business , and a dying one at that , " Ham said . " Not anymore , Ham . " Both Shannon and Jim Golden laughed . " If it were , you can be sure Supracorp would n't be in it . We 've only got one division that 's doing badly : Elstree Cosmetics . " " Elstree ? The English firm ? Seems to me my mother used Elstree . " " That 's the problem . It 's even more ancient and venerable and respectable than Yardley or Roger et Gallet . Everybody 's mother used it , but nobody 's daughter is using it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to turn them around yet . Elstree lost over thirty million last year . I 'm going to get involved personally in the new advertising campaign . The whole line is being redesigned ? again . " " Pat , " Jim Golden said , " I know you 're busy , but when you get a chance , would you drop into Dan 's office ? " " Problem ? " " Big , big problem . " " Why did n't you call me sooner ? Let 's do it now , " Shannon said impatiently . Walking quickly , he guided Ham and Golden straight past the bank of elevators and took the fire stairs , two at a time , to the floor above . Quickly he threaded his way through the maze of handsome corridors and went straight into the offices of Dan Camden , president of Lexington Pharmaceuticals . Ham Short was fascinated to note that the large office , which had the same view as Shannon 's , was furnished in an all but overpowering mixture of jewelhued damask and eighteenth-century antiques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home at Fairfax Plantation that he knew the antiques were genuine . Stepping from behind an enormous Chippendale desk , a small , bespectacled man welcomed them with a worried and preoccupied air . Almost immediately he directed their attention to a large white square that lay on top of his desk . " Pat , this is one of the first completed samples . In my opinion the last layer simply is n't as good as the lab boys thought it was . Six months of testing and they have n't got it right ! Now these first five layers here are all right , they perform to specifications perfectly . So far , so good . We could wipe the competition off the map , except that the last and crucial layer does n't work . Or , let me put it this way , it  | works , but just not well enough to justify the claims we plan to make . " " Got any water ? " Pat asked quietly . " Right here  --  I 've been working with it all morning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , onto the first layer of the white square . They all watched a large desk clock as , patiently , carefully , with intense concentration , they bent over the desk for long minutes . Ham Short sat down and watched the utter intensity on the faces of each of the three men . Patrick Shannon 's gaze never left his task . Ham felt himself dozing off . " There ! " Dan Camden exclaimed at last . Ham sat up with a jerk to see the man pointing an accusing finger at a tiny bead of moisture on the highly polished wood of his desk . " It 's at least two or two and a half minutes too soon . " " Shit , " Shannon said in a soft voice . " Dan , you assured me only ten days ago that the tests looked good and you know that I went before the stockholders at the meeting last week and told them that we were planning to grab a large chunk of the market with this new product . We 're not just looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the mark , and we 're not just talking about a well-plotted media campaign to test the market in twenty cities which will now have to be postponed , we 're talking about the expectations I you let me present to our stockholders , not one of whom will forget them . " He spoke quietly and calmly , but the flush which Ham Short noticed on his neck gave away his controlled anger . " Pat , I 'm just as upset about this as you are , " Camden protested , wiping his glasses in agitation . " Not really . You only have me to contend with and I 'm perfectly capable of understanding how the lab could fuck up  --  which , as it ; II happens , I do . But I 've got those bloodthirsty stockholders to deal with and I relied on your advice and your documentation . Next time , do n't give me a green light until you 're absolutely sure . Personally sure . Do n't take anyone 's word for it . " " The chief chemist ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understood ? Now I want those lab people over here from Jersey and in my office at four sharp this afternoon , so make sure they 're all present and accounted for , Dan . We 'll go into this then . See you later . " He turned away from the president of the giant pharmaceutical company who was , once again , absorbed in the white square on his desk . " Come on , Ham , we 've still got a lot of touring to do . "  | " What was all that about ? " Ham asked , once they were out of earshot of the secretaries working in the outer office . " Some sort of new invention ? " " When it works , and it has to , it 'll be the softest disposable diaper on the market . But it 'll never sell if the mother has to change her baby too often . We have to have a minimum of another three minutes of resistance in the outer layer and we can give Pampers a run for their money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hmmm , " grunted Ham Short . " Now , let 's go up to Troy Communications . I 'll give you a quick tour before lunch . " " Sure . " Lunch sounded like a good idea . and the sooner the better . Later that afternoon Ham had an appointment at his investment banker 's and he planned to ask the man what he thought of Shannon . . . personally . " He 's a damn privateer ! " Reginald Stein said . " Did n't strike me that way , " Ham Short commented . " Listen , Ham , he 's a damned riverboat gambler , or halfway to it . He 's too bold , takes too many risks for my taste and I 've got too much Supracorp stock not to be worried about him . " " But look at the growth of the corporation , " Ham protested . " I know , I know , you ca n't fault that , but everybody 's growing , Ham . These are fat years for certain kinds of businesses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so much is the downside risk , and Ham , you know as well as I do that there is always a downside risk . Shannon takes chances he does n't have to take  --  and I do n't like that . He 's not involved in safety and I am . And so should you be , my friend . " The banker paused . " Ham , just why do you ask ? " " No real reason , Reggie , just curiosity . " By now Ham Short knew for certain that he was n't going to have anything to do with a business that not only had a downside risk but was a business in which the seepage rate of baby piss was treated as a matter of life or death . He had enough plumbing problems in his life as it was . . . and sewage disposal problems as well  --  to get involved with dirty diapers . He was too old and he was too rich . He did n't need these complications . Maybe Pat Shannon could live with the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Short did n't intend to ever have to report to anybody . Not even to Topsy . " And please give me only brown eggs with breakfast tomorrow ,  | Mrs. Gibbons , " Ram instructed his housekeeper after dinner late on Friday night at Woodhill Manor . " Certainly , Sir , " the stout , self-respecting lady replied . Queen Elizabeth , too , would eat only brown eggs from a farm in Windsor . Mrs. Gibbons , to her relief , had seen few changes in forty years at Woodhill but she was beginning , albeit reluctantly , to approve of her late master 's grandson and heir . This rare weekend alone in Devon was a necessary respite for Ram . Recuperation and meditation were on his agenda . All winter he had been working particularly hard and staying out much later than was usual for him . His decision to set about a search for a wife had led him to accept invitations to a number of weekends and parties he normally would have refused , but the candidates had to be surveyed before he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , he was able to define what he did not want , although he still had n't found anyone remotely suitable . As he methodically got ready for bed he reviewed the possibilities he had rejected . They included any number of that group known as the " Sloane Rangers " ? after fashionable Sloane Square in Chelsea . They were clever young society women who spent their days shopping and having their hair done and trading secrets over lunch at San Lorenzo in Beauchamp Place , a close-knit clique who dressed in an informal uniform of checked or plaid blazers , silk shirts , wool skirts from St. Laurent and highly polished boots . Ram found them highly antipathetic . They knew each other far too well , they told each other far too much , they had , quite simply , been around too long to attract him . And having thoroughly looked over the current debutante crop of last spring 's beauties who had just been hatched , he had n't been charmed by a single one of the worldly herd of Amandas , Samanthas , Alexandras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Victorias and Mirandas , who at only eighteen already " knew everybody . " He fell asleep while he was mentally rejecting every girl he had met in the last four months . The next morning Ram took one of his Purdey shotguns and set out on foot . He intended to inspect his fences , at least symbolically , since nine hundred acres of fields could hardly be covered except by his bailiff and his men . However , Ram liked the idea of walking on his own land . There was something in the air , even now , as early as the beginning of February , which if it was not quite green , somehow smelled of approaching greenness , but it went unnoticed by Ram , who was thinking of an article he had recently read by Quentin  | Crewe , who pointed out that if a man had earned 250 pounds a week since the Crucifixion and saved every shilling of it , he still would not be as rich as the Dukes of Westminster or Buccleuch or Earl Cadogan . There were nineteen dukes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres  --  yes , land was still where the money was in England . But only as long as it was n't taken away by the government in the form of taxation . Private British wealth might only last out his lifetime  --  perhaps not as long as that . Ram had foreseen that possibility long ago and invested so heavily in other countries that even if he had to leave England and all he owned , including these ancient acres , he would always be excessively rich . Did he require a wife to be rich ? Not necessarily , thanks to his foresight . Did he require her to be of absolutely impeccable birth ? Yes ... sheer self-respect demanded that minimum . A virgin ? Again yes . It was perhaps , in fact , unquestionably , an old-fashioned notion in these days , but firmly in Ram 's mind was a need to find a girl of innocence , someone who had n't been exposed prematurely to the taint of the London Season , a girl not quite formed , who would adore and admire him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodhill Manor , a dwelling dating from the Elizabethan period , added onto in the time of Queen Anne , and boasting a new wing of Edwardian origin , which , because of the fairly uniform use of gray limestone and stone-tiled roof , formed a charming harmonious whole . It was not a truly grand house in the tradition of the great English country estates , but it had something new money could not buy : tranquility , grace , timelessness . He had sensed that same quality  --  to a much higher degree  --  on a trip he had recently made to Germany , in connection with investments in a large ball-bearing factory . There , he had been invited to spend the weekend at a Bavarian castle , a schloss which had belonged to the family of his hosts since the thirteenth century , in which twenty-two generations had managed to live without interruption in spite of wars , pestilence and other nastiness of history . This Germany , the Germany of the Furstenburgs and the WindischGraetzs , the Hohenlohe-Langenburgs , the Hohenzollern-Sigmarigans and von Metternichs , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called to something elemental in Ram . Not only did he appreciate the straightforward , unabashed richness of his hosts , he also approved of the emphasis he found everywhere among the nobility on serious , sensible application to the business of life . These were practical , stern , proud people who did not let the antiquity of their names deter them from extracting the  | maximum from their forests and their vineyards , from expanding their family businesses and investing in foreign countries . As he had sat at lunch with his host and hostess , Ram had seen , outside on a path on the other side of the lawn , two young girls , perhaps not more than eleven or thirteen , accompanied by a groom , riding past . " Our daughters , " the Prince had said with a casual wave toward the window which did not conceal the pride he took in them , even as he returned to an explanation of why anyone listed in Part One of the Almanach de Gotha can not marry somebody who is not listed in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This discourse was largely lost on Ram , as , in his mind 's eye , he contemplated the momentary vision of the two blonde children as pure and untouched as if they were figures in a tapestry . Still , he could not look to any young German girl for a wife . It was out of the question , for no matter how perfectly brought up and carefully protected she might be , no matter how flawless her English , how ancient her lineage , how splendid her accomplishments , she would still be foreign . To people like the Fulfords of Great Fulford Devon , and the Crasters of Craster West House , Craster , Northumberland , to others of the great untitled families of England , the Monsons , the Elwes , the Henages , the Dymokes  --  he , a direct descendant of Rurik , Grand Duke of Novgorod and Kief , founder of Imperial Russia  --  he , Prince George Edward Woodhill Valensky , was still something of a foreigner . Ram shrugged and resumed his walk . He faced without rancor the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough established for him to take a non-English wife . In his own opinion , even Queen Victoria had never quite lived down the stigma of Prince Albert 's nationality . As he cast a last backward thought at the memory of his glimpse of the two young German princesses he realized that he had been wasting his time prospecting in London , evaluating the harvest of young women . Although they told anyone who would ask that they were not officially entered in the marriage stakes , although " having " a London Season was now emphatically dismissed as merely a chance to " widen one 's circle of friends , " Ram was not fooled . A rich husband was even more avidly sought after in tax-poor England today than he had been in England of yesterday . Granted , the time was past when the first thing openly asked about any prospective mate , male or female , was the extent of that person 's wealth or expectations . Such healthy honesty had gone underground since the days , not so long ago at that , when Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income per year as an absolutely essential part of her description of any of her characters . Ram had always known the importance of money . There had never been a time he could remember when he was too childish to realize that his father was rich and his mother and her second husband were not . Nor did he believe that other people were n't as involved with money as he was . It was merely that they hid their fascination , as indeed he did , except at work . It was all very fashionable and up-to-date for a girl to protest that the worst thing that could happen to her was to be considered a prominent debutante , that what she really longed for was to become a student of Russian or Chinese history or travel around the world in a sailboat , that all she wanted was to be young and carefree and never think of things like income . Ram knew better . Her career , such as it was , would be abandoned gladly when the proper young man with the proper amount of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them , except for a few rare , odd females who had always been out of step with their world , a world that was certainly dying but nevertheless , as far as the English upper classes were concerned , the best world that had ever been . As Ram moodily considered the case of certain eighteen-year-old eligible beauties  --  Jane Bonham Carter , great-granddaughter of Prime Minister Herbert Asquith , who was already ensconced in the study of economics and philosophy at London University ; Sabrina Guinness , working for a living and in a frightfully unsuitable way if what Ram heard was true , as a governess for Tatum O'Neal  --  he suddenly realized that he should be searching in the world of seventeen-yearold girls . Eighteen was just too sophisticated , too headstrong , too stubborn , too self-oriented an age for a wife . By eighteen , a girl was ruined , Ram decided , breaking off a branch from a young oak and inspecting the buds without really seeing them . Sarah Fane , Sarah Fane ? The name swam into his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week over a business lunch , her father , Lord John Fane , had grumbled to him about his daughter . Had he been complaining because she insisted on coming out at Queen Charlotte 's Birthday Ball next May or because she had refused to be presented at the ball ? Ram could n't recall  --  he had n't paid attention  --  but he did remember that he 'd been surprised that the subject was even raised . It seemed a short time ago that he had seen her , a child of fourteen , when he 'd gone to spend a weekend in Yorkshire at Lord John 's  --  it must have been mid-August because they 'd been gathered for the opening of the grouse-shooting season .  | Could it have been three years ago ? He had a memory of a tall , shy silent girl with blue , clear eyes and long , straight blonde hair that kept falling over her face , but with something of an air about her . She had held herself with none of the stoop-shouldered attempts at invisibility one might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps firmly planted on the Fane moors as she followed the shooting party at a discreet distance . Well , whatever her plans for the London Season , it did n't traditionally start until the Private View at the Royal Academy on the first Friday in May . Ram decided to investigate Sarah Fane  --  the Honorable Sarah Fane , to be exact . She 'd probably prove to be another of many disappointments , determined to become a photographer 's model or a cordon bleu chef  --  but she had carried herself well , and by all calculations she must still be under eighteen . He 'd write himself a memo when he went back to the house . It was worth looking into . And after all , her grandfather was an earl .  | I just do n't like it , Kiki , ca n't you understand ? " Daisy went to the window and looked out at Prince Street , already busy with tourists from uptown spending this early fall day of 1976 wandering about SoHo . The air was still warm and the potholes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and half the size they would be by next spring , but there was no sign that the city intended to repair them . Perhaps , she thought , they were already considered historic landmarks . " Daisy , look at it this way , " Kiki implored her . " You 're doing them a favor by wearing his dress to their party  --  you 'll probably be photographed and that 's good publicity for Robin Valarian . " " I do n't trust the whole thing , " Daisy repeated stubbornly . " The dress ? But it 's so pretty , " Kiki protested . " No , I admit the dress is nice , even if it 's not my style . I mean , you do n't think that a wisp of chiffon and feathers like this , stolen practically line for line from St. Laurent 's last collection , will still look great in thirty-five years , do you ? But that 's not what I mean . I get this feeling of spider webs , spun from pure gold  --  but still webs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " she accused Kiki . " Maybe a little . In the last year you 've got Vanessa to thank for two major commissions , that big oil of the three Short girls and the other oil you did last Christmas of the two Hemmingway boys . She persuaded you to raise your price for watercolors by five hundred dollars , she 's insisted on giving you a couple of dresses , she 's invited you to a lot of parties  --  I grant you that . But look at what she 's had in return . " " What has she had in return ? That 's precisely why I do n't trust her . She is simply not the kind of woman who does nice things for the pure joy of it . I know her better than you do , Kiki , love  --  tell me what she 's getting from me ? " " Ah . . . " Kiki was momentarily wordless . " Another party guest ? You do n't really think that 's enough , do you ? "  | " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she is . " " Come on , Kiki . I 'm not all that important or that glamorous or that anything . " " You underestimate yourself  --  will you never stop ! Look , you do n't do the New York social scene because you 're too busy during the week and on weekends you 're usually away working at your portraits , so you have a definite scarcity value . That means something to Vanessa ! " Kiki 's eyebrows shot up to their most demonic heights . She thought it only normal and right that the Valarians should be generous to Daisy . It infuriated her that Daisy had never taken advantage of the collateral she possessed merely by being who she was , that she did n't milk her beauty and her title for all they were worth , that she had n't jumped on board the great American celebrity train that was just waiting for her to ride it . " Daisy , you 're not Cinderella , you know , you 're legit . " " And you 're a romantic  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , you 're a terrible cynic who wants me to cash in on an accident of birth . Even Serge Obolensky does n't use his title anymore . " " Well , he does n't have to sell portraits to Horse People  --  and plenty of other Obolenskys are still called prince and princess . " " Kiki , do you think we could stop splitting imperial hairs and get started on figuring out what I 'm going to take to Venice ? What do you suppose the weather is like in Venice in September ? " " Changeable , " Kiki answered authoritatively . " Luke should take a stick to you . " " He does n't go in for kinky sex , " said Kiki smugly . " Oh ? And just what does he go in for ? " " Hugging and kissing and touching . . . giving pleasure and caressing and ... " " Fucking ? " " Really , Daisy , how crude ! As a matter of fact . . . since you insist , he definitely goes in for . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mid-Victorian clergyman 's daughter . " Mercy , mercy ! Are n't you ever so pure now that you 've got him . . . you do have him , do n't you ? " Daisy asked with a touch of anxiety . " I just do n't know . " Kiki 's small , pointed face suddenly looked like that of a baffled kitten . " I did everything you told me . I only accept dates with him every other time he asks  --  sometimes not even that often  --  I 've worked up a whole fantasy world of other men that 's  | so real I believe in it myself , and I 'm more and more in love with that son-of-a-bitch every day . But he eludes me ! " She pounded her small fists on Theseus who licked her hand . He liked pounding . " Do you think I should n't have gone to bed with him . . . was that a mistake ? " " Of course not . The day is over when a girl can get a man by withholding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you to be essentially unavailable . Essentially ' does n't mean sexually , dumbbell  --  it means somewhere way down deep . In your soul . " " I think my soul is available , " Kiki said despondently , " and he knows it . Can you harden your soul the way you harden your heart ? " " Do you have a spiritual adviser ? " " Of course not . " " Perhaps you 'd better start looking for one . Now , come on ! What do you have that I can borrow ? " Arnie Greene , North 's business manager , was unhappy . He 'd advised North against taking the Pan Am job . It was a top account , but a Venice location meant that North and Daisy and Wingo would all be out of the studio for almost a week , unable to attend production meetings with other clients during the entire period , a fact that might cause a few days gap in their work schedule when they got back . " Is n't it going to take more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked North when Nick-the-Greek first brought in the job and asked him to bid on it . " Probably , " North had answered . " But for some reason or other , I 've never been to Venice , and I want to get there before it sinks . " Arnie sighed . If he had his way , North would never shoot on location farther from the office than Central Park . He reluctantly accepted the fact that when a story board called for flocks of pigeons , the Piazza San Marco and gondolas , you could n't do it in Central Park Lake . . . the pigeons maybe , but not the piazza . With melancholy , he wondered if gondolas were as unpredictable to work with as kids or animals . Well , he 'd made damn sure that there was enough padding in the bid to absorb the overtime of even the most incompetent gondolier . Hell , he 'd even taken out insurance in case a gondolier drowned . Arnie had also taken into account everything he 'd always darkly suspected about La Dolce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , all brought in from Rome , would insist on two-hour lunches , counted on problems of crowd control and pigeon shit , figured out what it would cost to transport North , Daisy , Wingo and six models to Venice and back ,  | first class all the way , added in a per diem living cost for all of them at the Gritti Palace which would pay the rent on his apartment for almost a year , made sure that every single item on the five-page list every commercial producer has to submit to the agency was as exact as he and Daisy could estimate , plus . They 'd done their job . Even if something went wrong and North had trouble , they could handle the extra expenses out of the padding of the bid  --  standard procedure . Fortunately they were n't financially responsible for the delays caused by weather . If he 'd had to worry about the weather he 'd have three more ulcers than the two he already had . " All right , but for Christ 's sake , North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you , at the least , hepatitis . " " Arnie , have I ever fallen into a canal ? " " You just said you 'd never been to Venice . And do n't eat raw shellfish . . . also causes hepatitis . " " Is it all right to look at the sunsets , or will they give me eyestrain ? " " Nobody appreciates me . " " Not true . " North gave Arnie a friendly glance . " But you worry too much . " " Well , something always does go wrong , does n't it ? " " Sure  --  if it did n't we might as well be making buttonholes . But you know Daisy will take care of it , whatever it is . That 's what we pay her for , is n't it ? " By the time the luggage was retrieved at the Marco Polo Airport and they 'd gone through customs and piled everything into a vaporetto , the Venetian equivalent of a bus , it was too dark and too late for either Daisy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six models , three male and three female , were due to arrive the following day , but North had decided that he would leave a day early in order to see the sights of Venice undisturbed . Daisy could use that extra day to make a last-minute survey of the locations , check with the local police about crowd control and make sure that the accommodations were ready for the technical crew , wardrobe people , make-up people and hairdressers who were due in from Rome the next afternoon . Venice was an audible shock , Daisy thought , looking out of the window of her room directly onto the Grand Canal , still hearing the slap of little waves against the side of the vaporetto . It did n't matter how much one had read about Venice or how far back in memory one  | had known that it was built on water , the reality came as a total surprise . It was impossible , she realized , to imagine Venice . In spite of the thousands of paintings it had inspired , it had to be experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed improbable , as if she had , like Alice , gone through the looking glass into a land of wonders , a play world , insubstantial , so romantic that it was almost ridiculous , a city that was one vast composition of great art , presumably dying and crumbling for hundreds of years , yet still vital , the inexhaustible subject of so much prose that there was nothing left to be said about it , yet millions of words had not drained one drop of magic from it . What ambitious creatures men were , after all , to have even attempted such a city ! Across the canal , in the middle of the moonlit night , she could plainly see the dome of Santa Maria delta Salute , that supreme masterpiece of Venetian Baroque . The fact that it was actually exactly where it should be was somehow miraculous and unexpected . . . . Daisy would n't be surprised if it had vanished by morning , nor if it remained standing long after New York and London had been reduced to rubble . Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start work , Daisy realized with a start , turning back to her high-ceilinged room , gay with striped blue-and-white satin walls and pink brocade draperies . That meant five hours sleep at the most . Luckily she had been able to nap a little on the trip over . North had sat in the front aisle seat of the first-class compartment , where he had room to stretch out his legs , and Daisy had taken a vacant seat several rows behind , so that she would n't disturb him . She knew that before a shoot as complicated as this one promised to be , he liked to withdraw into himself even more than usual , in preparation for the energy he would be pouring out during the next few days . As she got ready for bed Daisy wondered if , as she had plotted , she was going to be able to return to New York by way of London so that she could see Dani . She had n't been able to go to Europe at Christmas this year . The two large oils and six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so Daisy had been forced to choose to make . the money rather than to make the trip . It had been too long , oh , really much too long , she thought , since she 'd seen either Danielle or Anabel . She had decided not to ask North about taking the extra days off until the shoot was almost over . Then , with London so near , it would be difficult for him to refuse and her ticket could be rewritten at a minimum of expense . Wearily , Daisy pulled off the ancient jeans , T-shirt and British  | Army Commando jacket  --  fifty cents at a church jumble sale in London five years ago  --  that she 'd worn on the plane and had n't had off since they left New York . She took a shower , a long , languorous shower , very different from the brief " working " shower she was used to at home , which , dictated by the inadequate plumbing , she told Kiki was as much fun as bathing with a Water Pic . Her nightwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight-top vest in pink cotton with a drawstring around the top of the camisole and ribbon straps . Instead of the matching bloomers , Daisy wore purple satin basketball shorts , and her man 's dressing gown was from Sulka , a dark-red , figured silk with a shawl collar , still in excellent condition after twenty-five years , even if it swept the floor in a way it had never been intended to . Her mind jumbled with practical considerations and the waiting excitement of Venice , Daisy fell into a light and confused sleep , full of fragmentary dreams . When her traveling alarm clock went off , she was glad to jump out of bed and run to the window , the dreams disappearing in the promising , water-refracted light of morning . Dazzled , almost paralyzed with wonder , she stared at the view until she shook herself out of her reverie . It was really insane , she thought , to be expected to work here . They should have come a week earlier just to get acclimated to the beauty . But perhaps even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North his day of sightseeing and promised herself as she dressed rapidly that she 'd get everything checked out so efficiently and quickly today that she 'd have a few hours , at least , to roam around by herself before the others arrived . Late that afternoon , when North finally wandered back to the hotel , he found Daisy waiting for him right inside the entrance , curled up in a chair . " All set ? " he asked her . " Not exactly . " " What d' ya mean ? If everything is n't buttoned down , why are you hanging around the lobby ? Is n't there something you have to do ? " Daisy stood up , her hands on her hips , her feet apart , her energy restored . " North , hold it . " She put up a hand like a traffic cop . " It seems we have a small problem . " " You and your problems , " he said indifferently . " My feet hurt . " He started for the desk to get his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " North ? " " Oh , what the hell is it ? Honestly , Daisy , is n't it your job to worry about the little things ? Oh , all right , tell me . . . there 's a permit missing , the gondola 's painted the wrong color , one of the models has a pimple ? Improvise  --  how many times have I told you ? Improvise , Daisy . If I 've said it once I 've said it a thousand times  --  you take care of the little things and I 'll make it come out all right once I start working . " " Do you think you could get Alitalia to go back to work ? " " Why worry about Alitalia  --  we 're working for Pan Am . Christ , Daisy , you have no sense of proportion , " he said , turning away in exasperation . Behind him she said softly , " None of the other airlines is landing in Italy , North . Sympathy strike . " He spun around . " Wingo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " he said in renewed irritation . " Worse things have happened . Have n't you contacted models from Rome ? If I ca n't use the girls I picked I 'll use others , and I 'll manage without Wingo . Rome is full of cameramen  --  and beautiful women . " " The trains are on strike too , " Daisy said softly . " Tell them to drive , damn it ! If they start now they 'll be here by tomorrow . If they 'd started when you found out about the strike , I bet they could have been here by now , " he added accusingly . " The technicians are out on strike too . No crew , North . There 's nobody in Italy to handle the equipment , which , incidentally , is sitting somewhere between Rome and here . No camera , no brutes , no fey lights , no clapboard , no dolly , not even a stopwatch  --  nada ! And that 's why I did n't book models from Rome . " " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you that we could drive to France or Switzerland and shoot there ? Get ready to leave , " North snapped . " Shoot the Piazza San Marco and the pigeons and gondolas in France or Switzerland ? " Daisy asked sweetly . " But , damn it to hell , call New York ! You know that the agency can rewrite the story board in an hour if they have to ? " " The strike , " said Daisy slowing , lingering delightedly on every word , " has most unfortunately spread to the telephone system and the telegraph system . If some of those birds outside are carrier pigeons ... Otherwise we 're stuck here . " " That 's insane ! Daisy , you 're not trying ! Call up and rent a car . We 'll take a motorboat to dry land and drive to the nearest border and call New York from there . Let them pick out an alternative  | location  --  Pan Am goes everywhere . Why the hell did you have to wait for me to get back to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed ? What 's the matter with you  --  you 're slipping badly ! " " The car-rental people are out on strike . So is the gondoliers cooperative , and the vaporettos as well , " Daisy said , her black eyes so dark that the dance of joy and amusement in the depths of her pupils was almost concealed . " Shit ! Daisy , they ca n't do this to me ! " " I 'll tell them you said so , " Daisy said , " when they 've gone back to work . " " It 's . . . it 's . . . uncivilized ! " shouted North , waving his arms around the princely lobby of the hotel which had been the residence of a doge in the sixteenth century . " Why do n't we try to be philosophical , North ? It 's not as if we can do anything about it , " Daisy suggested calmly . Daisy had been thoroughly enchanted by the events of the day . As each avenue of escape closed , as , finding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in touch with news of the spreading strikes that the reception desk relayed from the radio , every moment became more pleasurable . She felt something invading her which she had difficulty in recognizing until she finally identified it as a sense of leisure . . . she remembered how leisure felt from college vacations . The charmingly attentive hotel employees , of whom there were two to every one of the hotel 's hundred guests , joined in her holiday mood  --  for tomorrow , who knew , might they not be out on strike too ? It was just the right weather for a strike , one of them had pointed out to Daisy . She agreed with him completely . If there was one thing in the world she could have wished for in Venice it would be a few days outside of time . And the hall porter assured her that no guests at the Gritti Palace had ever starved . Even if they had to eat buffet style , the management was prepared . At the worst , the principessa might have to make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Events did not do things to him , he did things to them . " We 're locked up here as if this were the Middle Ages and you talk philosophical ? " " There is still one way out , " Daisy said faintly . " What , for Christ 's sake ! " he roared . " We could . . . swim . " North swung around wrathfully and looked at his demented producer . At his gaze Daisy squeaked with suppressed laughter until she sounded like a whistling teapot about to come to a boil .  | " Arnie 's . . . " she sputtered before she was shaken by great outright howls of mirth , " Arnie 's . . . face ! " The vision of Arnie Greene 's mournful visage prophesying his inevitable hepatitis appeared before North 's eyes and his face splintered slowly , reluctantly , but unconditionally , with laughter . The hall porter and the doorman looked at the two Americans , shaken by spasms of hilarity , and shrugged smilingly at each other . The young principessa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prince Stash Valensky , who had been a faithful guest before his death , always coming to Venice for a week or two in September after the polo was over in Deauville . Only this morning she had come downstairs in man 's white pants and a striped purple-and-white soccer jersey . But perhaps it was a new fashion ? " You planned this whole thing , did n't you ? " North gasped , getting control of himself . " It was n't easy , " Daisy admitted modestly . " A whole country shut down so you could get a day off  --  nothing to it . " " I 'm efficient , I grant you , but I could n't have pulled it off in New York  --  too many gypsy cabs . " " Have you checked out gypsy gondolas ? " " A boy in a rowboat is the best I could find . " " Where to ? I 've got to have a drink before the bartenders go on strike . " North felt giddy . The combination of a day in Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted , made him feel like a kid let out of school just before an exam . " Harry 's Bar ? " Daisy suggested . " You mean like tourists ? " " Of course . . . but I have to change first . And you need a bath . I 'll meet you down here in an hour . Actually , I think we can walk there  --  I 've got a map . " " I 've been walking all day . Tell the rowboat boy to wait . " " Yes , boss . " North found himself smiling at Daisy . He supposed there really was n't anything specific he could fault her with . . . at least not until he found out more about this strike for himself . Back in her room , Daisy hesitated among the dresses she had packed , just in case something came up that she could n't do in her work clothes . She felt entirely feckless , as weightless as an astronaut . She picked the most elaborate dress she owned , a Vionnet gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bare-armed chemise , . skimpier than a slip , cut on the bias from black velvet . It had the deepest possible rounded neckline held up only by shoulder  | straps of crystal beads . The same beads were embroidered on the velvet in wide , fantastic circles , in a descending oval , so that it looked like a long necklace and the hem hung in two rippling points on either side of Daisy 's body , showing a flick of knees in front . It was a dress that must once have caused a major scandal . Black velvet in September ? Why not ? thought Daisy as she unbraided her hair . The style of the dress indicated a sophisticated hairdo , but she did n't have sophisticated hair , Daisy realized , as the Venetian light tangled in the blonde strands . She lifted it in both hands , extended her arms at full length still holding onto her hair and whirled around and around . What to do , what to do ? She was n't in a chignon mood or in a braid mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted her hair in the middle , took several yards of silver ribbon she 'd saved from a Hallmark commercial and twined it around so that some of the most flighty locks were held back from her face , the rest flowing loose . She flung on the cape of green and silver-shot lame made in the same period as the dress by a now unknown firm called Cheruit and went down to the lobby , more romantic than any heroine ever painted by Tiepolo or Giovanni Bellini . North was waiting , ready to leave . Not much of a drinker , he was unusually anxious for a drink . Alcohol was supposed to be a depressant , was n't it ? A depressant might help counteract the dangerously free-floating feeling in the atmosphere tonight . He needed to be brought back to earth , and there was no damn earth here  --  only the rippling reflections on the canal which made everything tipsy to start with . Where the hell was Daisy ? Why was she keeping him waiting ? He could n't remember ever having to wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Che bellissima ! Bellissirna ! " the hall porter said behind him . " Bellissima ! " echoed the doorman and the passing waiter and two men lounging about the lobby . " Well , " said North , looking at Daisy . Now he really needed a drink . " A Mimosa , Signorina , or perhaps a Bellini ? " the waiter suggested . North looked around at the long , narrow , famous room . " Do you make a martini ? I mean a dry martini ? " he asked , dubiously . " Fifteen to one , Sir . On the rocks ? " " A double . Daisy ? " " What 's a Mimosa ? " she asked the waiter .  | " Champagne and fresh orange juice , Signorina . " " Oh , yes , please . " The waiter showed no signs of leaving . He simply stood there looking at Daisy , expressing the most pure admiration with every inch of his wrinkled face . " We 'll have our drinks now , " North said flatly , breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , " North said in a voice which invested the syllable with discovery , mistrust and surprise and belligerence . " So ? " asked Daisy with slightly fake innocence . " What does that mean ? Do you think just because it looks as if nobody in Venice is worried , there is n't really any strike ? " " So this is what you look like when you 're not working , and so you must be putting on quite an act at the studio , and so I really do n't know a hell of a lot about you , and so this is what you get up as soon as you have a chance . " " So ? " Daisy shrugged blithely . " What 's wrong with that ? " " That 's exactly what I 'm trying to figure out . I know there 's something . " " North , North , go with the flow . " " What the hell is that supposed to mean ? " " I 'm not sure , but it sounds just right for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Adequate , " he said grudgingly . It was the best martini he 'd ever had in his life . " How 's your orange juice ? " " Pure heaven , absolute bliss , total delight , a dream , a vision , a revelation ... " " You mean you 'd like another ? " " How could you tell ? " " There was something . . . just a touch . . . almost but not quite a hint . . . an intimation . " " Very good , North , " Daisy approved . " When you start with intimations you 're getting there . " " Where , getting where ? " " Into the flow . " " I see . " " I thought you would . I 've always considered you a fairly quick study , " Daisy said airily , whirling her champagne glass between her fingers . " Calm affrontery  --  that 's your game after hours . Damning with faint praise . " " I think flattery is tacky . "  | " I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I was stupid , you defended me . " " Wrong . When other people say you 're an absolute shit , I defend you . " Daisy smiled angelically . " Christ ! Wait till we get back to the mainland ! Waiter , a butterfly net for the lady please , and two more drinks . " " I 'm having fun , " Daisy announced . " So am I , " said North , startled and newly suspicious . " Feels odd , does n't it ? " " Very . But I do n't think it will do any permanent damage . Unless we got used to it , of course , " North said thoughtfully . " You mean that fun 's fun but real life is n't supposed to be fun , at least not this much ? " " Absolutely . You 're not utterly devoid of a sense of values . That 's what I tell people when I defend you . They say that Daisy Valensky is nothing but a hard-working drone who never has any fun , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may have fun sometimes  --  they should n't judge by appearances . " " You really are a shit , North , " Daisy said , in a lilting voice . " I knew you were shining me on . " " Why do n't you fire me ? " Daisy suggested . " I 'm too lazy . And anyway I am a shit , sort of . I mean , I 'm not your ordinary good-natured slob . " " You 're not even an ordinary bad-natured slob . " " No use trying to provoke me . . . you said to be philosophical so I 'm being philosophical . " " How long can this last ? " " Go with the flow , Daisy . " " That 's my line , " Daisy said possessively . " I 'm a creative borrower , " North loftily proclaimed . " Get your own line , " Daisy insisted . " That 's stingy . You must be hungry . Should we eat ? " " I did n't have lunch , " said Daisy plaintively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy finding out about the strike . " She looked at him virtuously . " Which strike ? " wondered North . " We should eat . " " That 's my line , " said North . " But I 'll let you have it . I 'm feeling generous . Where shall we go ? " " We can stay and eat here , " Daisy suggested .  | " Thank God . I ca n't get up . Waiter , bring us everything . " " Everything , Signor ? " " Everything . " North gestured broadly . " Certainly , Signor . " The waiter appreciated the signor 's dilemma . How could he order sensibly in the presence of such glorious , fresh , young beauty ? How could he even eat ? Still , they must be properly nourished . To begin , naturally the famous filetto Carpaccio and then the green tagliarini gratinati , the noodles blended so suavely with cream and cheese and after , perhaps the calves liver in tiny strips alto veneziana served of course with polenta and for dessert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they had started on the liver . Sometimes tourists skipped dessert . " Thank you so much for a lovely evening , " said Daisy in a small , precise voice , outside the door to her room at the Gritti Palace . " Ah . . . I enjoyed it , too , " North answered . " That 's the right response , is n't it ? " He willed her to look directly at him , to meet his gaze , but she kept her eyes demurely downcast . " No , you should have said that you hoped you 'd see me again and asked if you might telephone when we get back to the city . " " Can I ? " " May I , " Daisy corrected him . " May I come in ? " asked North . " No , you may call me . " " But I said , May I come in ? " North repeated . " Oh , well , yes , in that case do call . " Impatiently , he put one finger under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she lowered her lids and continued to avoid his glance . " There 's a phone strike  --  so how can I call you ? " North asked . " True . But you could knock on my door , " Daisy said , vamping for time . " I said , May I come in ? " he repeated urgently . " Why ? " " Just because . . . " His face had lost its sharpness in the dim light of the corridor . His stance retained its swagger , his toughness still proclaimed itself in the set of his shoulders , but the familiar North air of indomitable willfulness , of battle readiness had softened , as if the moonlight had begun to wash it away . " Oh , well . . . in that case . . . I guess so , " Daisy said , opening the door with her key .  | " It 's only reasonable , " he assured her . " Reasonable ? " " Stop questioning everything I say . " " Stop telling me what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her in his arms and bent down to her lips . " From now on I 'll order you . " " How will I know the difference ? " Daisy asked in a panic , leaning away from him . " You 'll figure it out . " " Wait ! " " Why ? " ? " I 'm not sure that this is a good idea . " " I 'm the one who has the ideas . . . and this is a natural . " He picked her up and carried her to the bed as wide as a barge . " You , Daisy , are the detail person  --  I 'm involved in the larger creative effort . " He kissed her , holding her head between both of his hands . " North ? " she said , pushing herself up on the pillows . " Huh ? " he answered , busily coaxing the crystal straps from her shoulders . " Is this a mistake ? " " I do n't think so , but we have to make it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me you tasted so good . " " You never asked . " " My mistake . " There was awe in his voice as he murmured , " Where have you been hiding all these years ? " a note Daisy had never heard from this man whose terse , rapid commands had been the whip that drove her on . He , who had always crackled with combative directions , touched the tips of her breasts as carefully and reverently as an archaeologist , amazed and moved by the discovery of a long buried statue of Venus . His sharp features were blunted by the light reflected from the Grand Canal , and through her half-closed eyes she searched for the harsh and contained fire of the man she knew . But all his hard edges seemed to have melted as he was transformed into a tender , laughing , unknown lover , who covered her with long , sweet , almost thoughtful kisses as he slid his hands down to her waist and took possession of the warm , supple curve where her hips began and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " May I ? " he murmured , waiting until she nodded before he undressed her and then took off his own clothes and stood looking down at her with a smile of revelation on his lips , his naked body  | finer than she would have imagined it . . . and now she knew that she had imagined it , perhaps since she had first seen him . The turmoil of this sudden knowledge made her pull him down to her and finally dare to kiss his pointed nose and his eyes and his ears and his cheeks , all the surfaces she had watched so anxiously for years , trying to anticipate his orders , always tense with the necessity of keeping up with his frenzied pace , of being ready to supply whatever he needed . Abruptly , in their nakedness , they were equal , and under her lips there was only a warmth and this new , dear proximity . In a rush of prodigious pleasure Daisy thought , but he likes me , he approves of me , I 'm a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened her arms wide with surprise and flung them around his neck , pressing herself close , as close as possible , trying to keep him there in the compass of her arms so that he would n't change back to the North she had known . Little by little she became convinced that this unknown lover would not vanish . As he sensed Daisy gradually yielding up her fears and her hesitations North 's caresses became more firm and more insistent . He allowed himself to learn her body an inch at a time and when all protest , all holding back was long past , he parted her willing thighs , but before he entered her , he whispered again , " May I ? " " Yes , yes , yes . " " Still no change ? " North asked the hall porter . " No , Signor , I regret , nothing is happening , but we have learned that these strikes do not end as quickly as they begin . However , they do not occur often , a major strike like this , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's show biz , " North smiled , his lean body relaxed . " Did you notice where Miss Valensky went ? She 's not in her room . " " Ah , the principessa , yes , she just left , Signor . She said she had to pay a boy who was waiting with a gypsy rowboat . At least that 's what I think she said . Perhaps it was a gypsy boy . In any case , I offered to do it for her but she insisted . " " My God ! " North 's mouth quivered with laughter . " She really had one lined up . . . I should have known . " " Signor ? " " Nothing . I 'll go find her . " He walked quickly toward the entrance to the hotel and bumped into Daisy who was hurrying back in . " You were n't trying to escape , were you ? " he asked .
