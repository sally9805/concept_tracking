David Anthony Kennedy : 1955-1984 <P> The sheer longevity of the Kennedy melodrama is astonishing . Some Americans have grown weary of the spectacle , of course , the high American soap opera verging now and then upon Greek tragedy , and of the cruelly ingenious turns that the story takes . But there is something fascinating and emblematic about the family still . For a long time it dramatized the American possibilities of self-invention-old Joe Kennedy by sheer will contriving to raise up a President , to start a dynasty . But after Joe Jr. , and John , and Robert , the darker , the converse American principle intruded upon the drama , the principle that tends toward disintegration and failure , toward annihilation . <P> Last week a new generation of Kennedys trudged into that complexity . The long lens caught their photogenic Irish-American faces , eyes all downcast at the same angle of mourning , some shirtsleeves rolled up , a shirttail out the way that Bobby 's sometimes was . The cousins walked up Hickory Hill bearing one of their own , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their third son . Except for infant deaths years ago , David , at 28 , was the first of the new generation to die . <P> It was a Kennedy death that was different . When John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy were assassinated , theirs were the public deaths of public men brought down in the enactment of large public dramas . The same aura surrounded the death of the first Kennedy brother , Joseph Jr. , killed in a plane explosion while on a secret military mission from England in 1944 . <P> David died alone in a hotel room in Palm Beach , a sad and private capitulation to drugs and confusion and an unappeasable grief . The burden to which he was heir was not the burden of public service and sacrifice , but the ( for him ) unbearable burden of being a Kennedy . And the burden of an appetite for drugs that he could not control . Yet though his death was miserably private , being a Kennedy he also became a public example , a sermon against drugs that parents will preach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , off and on for years , to get free of drugs . Not long ago he completed a course of treatment at St. Mary 's Rehabilitation Center in Minneapolis . Just before the Easter weekend , David flew down to Palm Beach to spend the holiday with his ailing 93-year-old grandmother Rose and other members of the family , including Caroline Kennedy . He did not stay at the oceanside Kennedy winter mansion on North Ocean Boulevard , but checked into a $150-a-night room at the Brazilian Court Hotel , a rambling three-story place five miles away . <P> It seemed to be a quiet stay . David visited his grandmother every day and went to Mass with the family on Easter Sunday . By most accounts , David behaved himself . Said Hotel Owner Dennis Heffernan : " He swam more than once every day . I would see him three or four times a day . He did have a few drinks at the bar , but no more than anyone else , not an unusual amount . I never saw him take a misstep , never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
