Man ' s yearning to fly has lifted legend and drama from Icarus to Peter Pan , but the subject never leaves the ground in Peter Parnell ' s " The Rise and Rise of Daniel Rocket , " now receiving its Chicago premiere by the Reflections Theatre Company . Parnell ' s comedy-fantasy is a tedious reworking of a number of modern rebel-hero sagas . Daniel Rocket ( John Graham ) , Parnell ' s hero , isn ' t so much a symbol as a composite , drawn from pop fiction from the last three decades and now a cultural icon whose attributes and eccentricities show up in second-rate movies . In Act I , Daniel is a junior high school genius , nerd and social outcast , scorned by most of his classmates and cause for worry by his teachers  --  his straight-A marks aren ' t enough to compensate for his alarming determination to fly without any mechanical aid . Just before intermission , he makes it , telling the 12-year-old he loves that he ' s been able to do so secretly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Act II , Daniel and his former schoolmates are adults . He ' s a superstar because of his flying powers , a sort of Charles Lindbergh without a plane , while they have settled into predictable lives of marriage , parenthood and divorce . He returns for a homecoming in a sequence that borrows from " It ' s a Wonderful Life " and " The Right Stuff , " to name but a few . Parnell ' s drama crash-lands on two levels . The schematized symmetry of earth/sky , compromise/escape and mediocrity/superstardom is mercilessly blatant and superimposed . More fatal is the playwright ' s inability to fill in his road map with storytelling details and fancies . For want of a more inventive plot , he takes Daniel ' s Act I romance  --  with Alice ( Rosemary G. Brcich ) , a girl in love with Daniel ' s only real friend , Richard ( Mark Arthur Miller ) and turns that into a tediously drawn out triangle in the second act . Except for the flight imagery , the whole thing is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real charm and skybound whimsy come from the technical aspects of the production . The pastel , building-block set by Michael Ryczek , Mark L. Kroon and Dave Sippel and Sippel ' s airy lighting effects ( along with a nice use of John Williams ' " Superman " movie score ) touches on the starry delicacies that Parnell the playwright can not . The actors are funny as 7th- graders in the first act , rowdy and repulsively pre-pubescent , but their energies can ' t carry the whole . And Graham doesn ' t yet have enough star technique to carry his leading role . Daniel is conceived as some kind of pied-piper poet , but Graham plays the part as just another disturbed kid and , as an adult , a not very likable loser .
