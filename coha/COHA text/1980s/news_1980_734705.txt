txt I S N'T IT ALWAYS . the way ? On the very night of the big high school dance , a huge , pullulating pimple will burst through right on the tip of the nose , its presence recorded by screams of mortification and shame . These days , though , it 's quite likely to be the parental chaperones who. are discovering blemishes , not the traditional adolescent victims . Doctors estimate that millions older than 25 ? most of them women ? are plagued by some form of acne , a fact that reneges on the comforting old promise that time always cures the ravaged complexions of youth . To be sure , acne always was and still is primarily an affliction of adolescents with overactive glands . But since hormonal activity is not limited to pubescence , neither are pimples . Excessive stress , a change in medication , or the use of fatty , oily makeups designed to conceal complexion problems all contribute to acne and keep those as old as 65 rueing the eruptions . Dermatologist James Fulton of Acne Health Care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 20 . He says the reason for this high figure is the large number of women in the work force today . " They 're , wearing more cosmetics , facing greater stress on the job , " he says . " Their skin is exposed to more environmental pollutants , and many are going on and off birth control pills . The so-called ' minipills , ' with their high dosage of male hormone , are very suspect . " NORMA RODRIGUEZ , 29 , of Lisle  --  a man , agement coordinator , knows the acne story well . Several years ago she was a junior executive with a fast-food chain and suffering with an acne problem that had vexed her since she was 13 , " I 'd always pointed toward 18 as the time when I was sure it would go awayr she recalls . " The day came , and it was still in full force . " Her first , realization that acne was related to stress came when she left home at 23 , moved into her own apartment , and found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight . The pressure of organizing conventions and meeting organizational representatives of work translated directly to unsightly skin lesiOns , she found . " It may not have bothered the people I met , " she says , " but it sure bothered me . " Even in a dimly lighted disco , dancing the night away with new friends , she was highly aware of her complexion problem . She made sure to leave before 2 a.m. when the lights went up , " because I did n't want the guys to see me with zits . " Sometimes she would n't go out ? at all . Rodriguez , short and bubbling with bright-eyed friendliness , says she lost her " vivaciousness " and felt unattractive and self-conscious when her face sported large blemishes periodically . . " BEAUTY PLAYS a very Important role in dating , " she says . " And you do n't feel pretty when you 've got a third eye . You feel like your date is saying , ' What 's with this woman ? " ' A year and a half ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she avoided seeing him under strong lights until the third date . When he saw how red her face was from medication , he told her later , he was afraid she had an awful , mysterious skin disease . The slightly irritating medication was a ben- zoyl peroxide preparation popular among dermatologiits . Fulton claims an 80 per cent clearup rate with the treatment , which , he says , is sold over the counter in drug stores . Fulton has found that benzoyl peroxide , applied to the skin , is far more effective in preventing infections and killing bacteria than systemic antibiotics such as tetracycline . A medical reference text , " Acne , Update for the Practitioner , " published in 1979 for the New York University School of Medicine , explains that benzoyl peroxide not only kills surface bacteria but also penetrates the pores to inhibit blockage caused by excess oil or bacterial infections . USERS APPLY benzoyl peroxide several times a day with varying frequency and potency , depending upon the lesions and sensitivity to the irritating chemicals . Fulton is convinced the remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highly publicized 13-cis-retinoic drug , a vitamin A derivative that has been overwhelmingly successful in laboratory tests on victims of severe acne . " The retinoids are suspected of causing birth defects and probably will not be available to women , " Fulton says . " All the publicity given this treatment is almost cruel , because it 's three to five years from Federal Drug Administration approval , of which I am doubtful . " Rodriguez , whose face is " under control " after benzoyl peroxide therapy , says , she feels more'Confident now . She appears outgoing and relaxed and talks freely about her problem . " Most people do n't want to admit they 've got a problem and that it makes them act differently , " she says . " The reason is that acne is gross ; it really is . It 's not like any other disease . " Rodriguez would know . She is regional coordinator for Acne Health Centers , and the office in which she works is liberally decorated with photographs and diagrams defining the degrees of violence with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distress . Their concern often has little to do with the severity of the case , because the harms of acne are primarily psychological . ' Many middle-aged victims of acne 's Minks are those whose skin remained clear ' in high school when everyone else was splattering mirrors and brooding like Saul . The sheClc , of these untimely eruptions leaves many shaken and discouraged . " I had beautiful skin until I turned 32 , " recalls Vanessa Creeth , 39 , an accountant . " Now it 's getting worse . Each outbreak gets worse . " At the first sign of acne , Creeth was sure the pimples simply would go away , because , like many other sufferers , she thought she was far too old to break out . She learned the hard way that one is never too old to get nagging , persistent acne that does n't respond well to drugstore remedies . At first , only the right cheek was spotted , then the infection spread to her entire face . " Relatives who had n't seen me for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost angry . She asked , ' Why do n't you do something about your skin ? Why do n't you go to the doctor ? " ' CREETH VISITED a dermatologist when the acne turned cystic , threateningg. permanent scars . The doctor put her undhl ultraviolet sunlamps and prescribed antibiotics to kill the systemic bacteria that doctors believe contribute to acne . The treatments controlled the ' condition temporarily , but Creeth still is subject to increasingly bad flareups . She once overheard a coworker say , " Mrs. Creeth would be a very attractive lady if she did n't have that acne , " and the memory haunts // Adult acne : The anguish of never being in the clear // her . " My problem Is n't really severe anymore , " she says , " but every stressful situation shows up on my face . I ca n't be my usual perky self when I break out . " She finds herself shying away from face.to-face dealings and occasionally refuses social engagements . " Some days I just feel ugly and ca n't bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at me the zits are the first things they notice . " The trauma of a divorce , cosmetic camouflage of her blemishes , and the occasional use of birth control pills have caused the maddening , impertinent pimples . Creeth feels impotent in treating the condition , and that causes further frustration , rage , and pain . . " I 'd give $1 million if my akin would just clear up , " she says . BUT EVEN IF she had 21 million , she could n't buy a real cure for acne . For those with the tendency ? and doctors generally believe that it is a genetic trait ? acne is as unavoidable as death and taxes . Victims can only hope to control the severity of eruptions with medication until the condition runs its course . Even though acne is widespread and Inescapable for most persons , there is a stigma attached to the ailment that makes sufferers feel unclean , perverse , and guilty of manifold dietary sins . Dr. Henry Roenigk , chairman of dermatology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital , says research shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with slipshod hygiene , masturbation , smoking , or french fries . These myths die hard . The truth is that pimples develop when the follicle ducts that bring the natural skin oil ( sebum ) to the surface become impacted with microscopic fungi , bacteria , dead skin , and other toxic debris . Doctors believe that the excess oil production in periods of hormonal activity makes the skin particularly susceptible to blocked pores and bacterial buildup . ACNE PROBABLY CAME to the United States on the Mayflower ; it does not occur in full-blooded native Americans or blacks , and it tends to be more severe in men than women , as male hormones have the greater effect on the sebaceous glands . Although research has shown the way toward more effective control , there are still unknown causes of acne , and different dermatologists endorse different treatments , depending on what their observations have led them to believe is effective . Chicago dermatologist David Cornbleet agrees with colleagues who say that acne is as common today as it was 20 years ago among teen-agers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmetics seem to be more accepted . " Makeup and soaps , especially when overused , can cause unnatural blockage or ellnarcenalflah , a Om IS kin Almost 20 million acne victims spend an estimated 9100 million a year on over-the-counter treatments , many of which , dermatologists report , can irritate the condition when used immoderately . The American Pharmaceutical Association reports that consumers spend an additional $20 million a year on prescription acne treatments . A COMMON HOME-remedy Is to attempt to squeeze the pus and infection from the follicle . The temporary cosmetic effect of pimple-popping is undeniable , and the process is psychologically satisfying as individual blemishes are vanquished between thumb and forefinger . Doctors note that the squeezing action may get rid of one pimple but almost certainly will cause another somewhere else . In some cases the-lesions are far too Infected and painful even to touch . The cystic , boiling acne ceguniblate that plagued Mary Jaegera , ' 23 , of Mitten Grove , last year was characterized by " pimples " . that protruded as much as half an inch from her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television . Jaegera scarcely ever had a pimple until Mardi , 1979 . Then , practically overnight ? for reasons doctors are still investigating ? her face broke out violently . Jaegers says she looked'as if she had been attacked by a swarm of bees ; as if someone had thrown scalding water on her ; as if she had gone face-first through a windshield . She could n't bear to see friends and refused to get close to her husband , Gary . Her children could n't even kiss her because any contact created fierce , stabbing pain that almost made her black out . She spent every day inside , hiding . " I WAS LIKE a Stepford Wife , " she recalls . " All I did was clean the house , over and over . I can remember dusting off the cans of soup . The only time I 'd go out was to the grocery store , and there I 'd see people staring at me and hear them whispering , ' Oh , that poor girl . ' " Gary Jaegers worked 12 hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical bills from his wife 's various treatments . When he arrived home , she had grown so frustrated and depressed that they would quarrel bitterly , and she would throw him out . " People would say they knew how I felt , " Jaegers says , " but that made me mad , because no one could know the agony . Gary told me he still loved me , but I just put my head on his shoulder and cried . I did n't care anymore . How could he still love me when I was so distrustful , and convinced that her once . happy life was ruined . Even now , after Fulton 's benzoyl peroxide therapy has eliminated the infections , Jaegers remains physically and emotionally scarred from her battle with one of the worst cases of acne the doctor had ever seen . Behind the raw traces of blistering infection , Jaegers is an attractive , direct young woman who carries herself proudly , Gradually she is allowing herself to go out again , and she and Gary are attempt . ing to put their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worryworn , and emotionally battered by the ailment that changed his life so drastically . One thing his wife has learned is that there is nothing so horrible that it can not be overcome . If she ever takes a job , it will be as a hospital volunteer where she will tell patients not to give up hope , because , she says , making up your mind to fight is half the battle in life . Still , she can not put the acne out of her mind . The mirror reminds her every day of the last year , and her young children , 5 and 3 , worry about their mommy dying . Jaegers says she still has no friends : " No one ever calls me , and I never call them . " SOME LONGTIME victims of acne learn to succeed in spite of their condition . Charles 011ila , 41 , a ? prosperous grocer in Ishpeming , Mich. , still was Ricking and poking at his pockmarked face right up until his dermabrasive surgery in mid-June , when the top few layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a metallic grinding wheel . 011ila , who never hits been able to shave with a razor blade , had been bothered by cystic , scarring acne for as long as he can remember . " Everybody else had it in high school , so it did n't bother me too bad then , " he it had bothered me more and more . " Alternately sitting up and lying down to shake off the effects of the Valium that dulled the pain of the operation , he spoke about the emotional scars of acne that no surgery could eradicate . His head was wrapped almost completely in gauze . " Kids can be mean about it , " he said , " but adults are more tactful and tolerant . The time I took the most teasing was in the Army . There were a lot of cliques . They called me , ' Hey , Zitface , ' you know ? I just could n't control it . " After the Army the acne made me self-conscious in job interviews . I had tried almost everything I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills . I did n't understand : I never even was a candy eater or a soda drinker . " OLLR , A 'S ACNE , which he was certain would go away when he reached 30 , brought reactions of pity and disgust . It was , he said , one of the most severe cases he had seen in an adult : " People understand something like an amputation , but not zits . It was the first thing some people noticed , especially when the eruptions were bad . It 's difficult to get eye contact when'someone 's just staring at your face . " The - skin problem made him crabby , nervous , and has irritated his condition of hypertension . Stress in his job was very high anyway , he said , and years ago a divorce and family problems caused more frequent and severe eruptions . Since his remarriage , the acne has subsided a bit due to " peace of mind , " and faithful application of benzoyl peroxide medication has kept the outbreaks of pimples under control . It was too early to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but 011ila smiled through the bloody surgical bandages that masked him like a mummy . " It feels pretty good to be saying goodbye to acne.
