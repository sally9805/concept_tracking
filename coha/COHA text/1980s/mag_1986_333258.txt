In what seemed at the time to be a significant scoop , the Wall Street Journal last Aug. 25 carried a story that began , " The U.S. and Libya are on a collision course again , and the Reagan Administration is preparing to teach the mercurial Libyan leader another lesson . " White House Spokesman Larry Speakes described the report as " unauthorized but highly authoritative . " That was enough to send U.S. news organizations scrambling after a yarn that promised to involve terrorist plots and possible U.S. retaliation . <P> Given the bloody history of recent terrorist attacks and the resulting U.S. bombing raid on Tripoli and Benghazi in April , American reporters had good reason to go after the story . But they were chasing a will-o ' - the- wisp . The Washington Post claimed last week that the rumors over Libya had been instigated by the Administration in a " secret and unusual campaign of deception " to destabilize Muammar Gaddafi . <P> The newspaper 's famed Watergate sleuth , Bob Woodward , unearthed a damning document to back up the charge : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In it Poindexter outlined a plan that " combines real and illusionary events  --  through a disinformation program  --  with the basic goal of making Gaddafi think that there is a high degree of internal opposition to him within Libya , that his key trusted aides are disloyal , that the U.S. is about to move against him militarily . " According to the Post , this disinformation policy was approved on Aug. 14 at a meeting of the National Security Planning Group , made up of Reagan , Poindexter and nine officials from relevant departments . The President later signed a National Security Directive putting the plan into effect . <P> As news of the high-level hoax stirred a furor in Washington last week , the Reagan Administration denied that it had orchestrated a campaign to mislead the public . " We did n't tell any lies , " said the President , although he admitted " there are memos back and forth . . . I ca n't deny that . " A quick report from the Senate Intelligence Committee seemed to support Reagan 's disavowal . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the committee 's staff , there was no deliberate policy behind it . <P> The Administration readily acknowledged its policy to mislead Gaddafi as to U.S. intentions  --  a deception the President endorsed . " We would just as soon have Mr. Gaddafi go to bed every night wondering what we might do , " said Reagan . Secretary of State George Shultz agreed . " Frankly , I do n't have any problems with a little psychological warfare against Gaddafi , " said he . Citing the example of Winston Churchill 's efforts to mislead the Nazis about the site of the D-day landings during World War II , the Secretary said of the situation with Libya , " We do n't have a declaration of war , but we have something pretty darn close to it . "
