This week 's meeting in the Med will bring together the most daring of all Soviet leaders and one of the most cautious American Presidents . Mikhail Gorbachev frequently , and proudly , describes his approach to the world as " radical , " while George Bush 's favorite word when he talks about foreign policy is prudent . Yet Bush has come a long way in his thinking about the Soviet Union . In a matter of months , his Administration has gone from viewing Gorbachev as a slickly disguised variant of the old red menace to a potential partner in creating a new world order . <P> This evolution of American official attitudes has been subtle and uneven . It has been couched in caveats , often obscured by ambivalence and articulated , sometimes inarticulately , by a Chief Executive who has no flair for geopolitical grand rhetoric and has a tendency to step on his applause lines . Still , the change on the American side , if it continues , could turn out to be as important as Gorbachev 's abandonment of the Leninist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American equivalent of what the Soviets call new political thinking is all the more significant coming from the President of Prudence . <P> George Bush did not get where he is today by taking chances or questioning conventional wisdom , particularly on the No. 1 life-or-death issue of U.S. foreign policy . As a Congressman , diplomat , Republican Party chairman , Vice President and presidential candidate , he was always the sort of politician who fretted about the consequences of a misstep . For Bush , therefore , slow is better than fast and standing pat is often the safest posture . Once he replaced Ronald Reagan , Bush 's instinct was to apply the brakes to the juggernaut of improved U.S.-Soviet relations , to take the turns very cautiously and perhaps even to pull over on the side of the road and study the map for a while . <P> The Bush Administration was made up of battle-scarred veterans with long memories . They were acutely aware that every President since the end of World War II had learned the hard way the domestic political perils of underestimating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profound , permanent improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations . <P> Even Franklin Roosevelt was posthumously excoriated for " giving away " Eastern Europe to Joseph Stalin at Yalta ( rhymes with Malta ) . Harry Truman stood up to Stalin at Potsdam and hung tough over Iran , Berlin and Korea , but he still ended up being pilloried by a couple of junior Senators named Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon . It was Nixon who called Truman 's Secretary of State the dean of the " cowardly college of Communist containment . " Two decades later , the New Nixon 's policy of detente ran into a buzz saw of bipartisan anti-Soviet opposition . When a Watergate-wounded Nixon went to see Leonid Brezhnev in the Crimea in 1974 , he refused to visit Yalta nearby , lest anyone accuse him of another giveaway . It was all for naught : the traveling White House press gleefully filed stories with the dread dateline . <P> When Jimmy Carter signed a SALT II treaty in June 1979 , he gave Brezhnev a big kiss on the cheek . The treaty was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months later . In 1980 Republicans used photographs of the signing ceremony with the message to voters YOU TOO CAN KISS OFF JIMMY CARTER .
