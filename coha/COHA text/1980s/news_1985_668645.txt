The Du Page County Board approved a $4. 8 million project Tuesday to reconstruct the crumbling walls of its 12-year-old County Farm Administration Building , but at the same time county attorneys were preparing to argue before the Illinois Supreme Court that the county has the right to sue the architectural and construction firms for damages . Wegman Construction Co. of Aurora received the $4 , 875 , 600 contract to reconstruct all masonry on the 277 , 000-square-foot building and is expected to begin work June 4 . The project will take about two years , said Arnold Kumorek , the county ' s capital plant director . Attorneys for Du Page will go before the Supreme Court on May 29 to describe what they say is a systemic deterioration of the building ' s brick facade as a result of shoddy design and construction . Attorney John Elsner , chief of Du Page County State ' s Atty . James Ryan ' s civil division , and co-counsel Mark Enright , a county attorney , said that before deciding whether the county has legal standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s refusal to review the case in its initial stages was correct . The battle between the county and the firms that designed and constructed the building was held up last year when lawyers for the construction firms sought dismissal of the suit on grounds that the county didn ' t file it in time . The Appellate Court refused to hear an appeal by attorneys for the firms responsible for building the brown-brick county complex . They had argued unsuccessfully before Du Page County Circuit Judge William Black that the county waited too long to sue the architects and the builder for any alleged defects . In refusing a motion to dismiss the suit , Black ruled that the statutes of limitations that apply to similar suits involving private property do not apply to property owned by the public . He suspended further proceedings , however , to allow attorneys for the builders to appeal his pretrial ruling . Appeals courts generally don ' t accept cases for review until a judgment has been made . There are exceptions , and the Supreme Court decision to take the Du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . In describing how the $4. 8 million for reconstruction will be spent , Kumorek said the project will include removal of existing face brick , installation of new brick and installation of a new roof , new windows and other construction . The reconstruction cost is nearly half of the original 1973 construction cost . County officials said they noticed flaws in the building as early as 1974 . Bricks started falling off the building in 1981 , causing the county to begin an on-going plan of shoring up the masonry by installing vertical braces between the building ' s lintels and window ledges . Plywood-covered scaffolding is in place over the building ' s loading dock to protect people working in lower levels of the building . The county paid more than $200 , 000 to identify the source of the masonry problem and another $857 , 000 to develop plans to remedy it . In 1982 the county sued Graham , Anderson , Probst &; White , the Chicago architectural firm that designed the building ; Leonard Kendra , the chief architect on the project ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the design and construction were improper and that the architect and builder failed to notify the county of initial defects . A county consultant said the building was constructed without enough drainage to carry water away from the masonry . The freezing and thawing of water in the masonry has caused it to loosen and shift , the consultant reported . CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by John Bartley .
