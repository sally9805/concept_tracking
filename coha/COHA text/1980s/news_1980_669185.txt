" The people here on campus at Wellesley College are very friendly , " she says in an interview . Then she frowns . " But when I lived in Cambridge last summer , many scenes in Central Square  --  like drunkards and poor old people  --  depressed me . The poor looked worse in the United States than in China. " // Walking around campus , you probably wouldn ' t notice Ru-lian . Wearing navy corduroy pants , red windbreaker , and clogs , she blends well with American students . If you stopped to ask her a question , you ' d discover she speaks English confidently and emphatically. // Ru-lian comes from China ' s elite ; her Peking home , she explained , is furnished with sophisticated things like television , a radio , a tape recorder , and a telephone . Both her parents received graduate degrees from American universities. // Out of 900 million mainland Chinese , she is one of about 4 , 000 first-rate Chinese students studying in the US . Slightly over 2 , 000 are private students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30s ; the rest are government-sponsored graduate scholars , generally in their 30s and 40s , doing study and research to accelerate China ' s modernization . In comparison , only 150 American students are now studying in mainland China. // Wellesley College enrolled mainland Chinese students in the early 1900s : It is the alma mater of Taiwan ' s Mme. Chiang Kai-shek , who received her bachelor ' s degree in 1917 . As far as can be determined , the last mainland Chinese student attended Wellesley in 1947. // Ru-lian was enrolled last year as a " special student " ; this September she became an official freshman . She will probably major in English. // The vast educational resources and freedom of choice for students in the US impress Ru-lian . " In China , " she explains , " all classes are arranged for you from elementary grades through high school . If you go on to a university , you choose your major ; but even all courses for the major are prearranged . In the Us it ' s up to you to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because , she says , " When a student is really eager to learn something , he or she knows best what weak points need strengthening . When classes are already outlined , there is less opportunity for growth. " // To her surprise , she found her US teachers friendly and very accessible . " They ' re different from teachers in China , " she posits , " a little more considerate , and very encouraging. " // Because she has seen many educational facilities such as computer terminals and scientific laboratory equipment easily available to students , Ru-lian remarks , " American students should study well . " She assumes they do. // They would do well to study as industriously as Ru-lian , who now has a full Wellesley scholarship. // She recalls a time when she couldn ' t study . During two of her high school years she built houses , planted cotton , and dug wells in Hubei Province in central China  --  far from her Peking home Chairman Mao Tse-tung sent students to work in the fields  --  " to identify with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ru-lian , the hot summers , freezing winters , and mandatory political study-discussion sessions about Mao ' s works made studying impossible . Schools were closed four to five years in the late 1960s . When they began reopening in 1970 , Ru-lian returned to Peking and taught English 6 1/2 years in a high school. // It was not easy , she says . Most Students she had in class refused to learn . Many shouted while she talked . They saw little use for knowledge and feared they would face more government repression if they learned too much . The schools were in disarray until 1977 and ' 78. // Would she be in the US if official educational exchanges between he People ' s Republic of China and the United States had not been established in January 1979 ? " I doubt it , " she replies . " Before that time it was hard for us to apply . Universities in the United States probably didn ' t want Chinese students , and it was difficult to get approval from the Chinese government to leave. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smiles and seriousness . " Americans are so easily excited ! They ' re warm . That ' s good . " At a baseball game , she had more fun watching the spectators shout than looking at the game itself. // Last winter , when she heard Americans complain about clearing leaves from their lawns and snow from their porches , she thought : " In China , that is just something we do. " // Neither Ru-lian nor her Chinese girlfriend , Ronni Wang , wants to stay in the United States after receiving her degree . Both say they would be frightened to look for their own jobs. // Ru-lian explains : " In China , the government will definitely find a job for you in your field of study . Your college immediately places you in a position after graduation . This gives you a feeling of security . You know you won ' t be unemployed . " She says that as far as she knows , everyone is employed. // She adds : " Our system has a disadvantage , because the security is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid as much as those who work hard . But now things are improving . Rewards are given to those who do best. " // Would such a system limit the Chinese in changing jobs or careers ? Ru-lian laughs . " Students just don ' t change their fields ! And people rarely quit a job . If they do , it ' s very hard to get another one. " // Ru-lian hopes to become a traslator or literary works  --  particularly novels and short stories  --  into Mandarin , China ' s national language . Ronni Wang , also at Wellesley , will continue her work in art when she returns to China  --  but only after eight-hour workdays , since , as she explains , she is not an official " artistc of the state. // About China , Ru-lian says , " The best thing to do is to modernize the country . In America you look around and everything is modern . I really hope my own country advances more quickly. " // //            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
