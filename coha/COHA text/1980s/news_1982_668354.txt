Flick on cable television any evening , warns Robert Ward , and the viewer is likely to be bombarded with an array of erotic fare . " I ' m not talking about Dallas , ' " he says . " I ' m talking about hard core pornography . " Adult entertainment , he argues , is subverting the Judeo- Christian values upon which the nation was built . He and the 3000 members of his group , called Morality in Media in Massachusetts , believe it ought to be subject to regulation , which is not , he contends , to be confused with censorship . " There are minimum standards of decency we ' re looking for , " he says . " Beyond that it ' s impossible to apply any standards . " The distinction is lost on the likes of Peggy Charren , president of the national advocacy group , Action for Children ' s Television . " If that isn ' t censorship , what is ? " she asks . As a pipeline for bringing sexually explicit material into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between free speech and censorship . To date the pipeline for such material reaches only one million of the 21 million homes across the country wired for cable . But , with that number expected to triple in the next decade , most experts agree that cable will ultimately become the largest and most lucrative outlet for adult entertainment in the home . Without regulation , predicts Ward , " cable television is going to make porno parlors out of living rooms . " Ward concedes that cable operators in Massachusetts have so far aired nothing racier than R-rated movies . But , in his view , it ' s only a matter of time before economic incentives lead them to air the harder stuff . He notes that over-the-air , pay television suppliers , such as Star TV , have already spiced up their offerings with such R-rated titles as " Insatiable " and " Misty . " But the offerings of those vendors must conform to federal regulations which dictate that they meet " prevailing community standards of decency . " " If this is happening on Star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen on cable ? Cable is unregulated . " Ward and his group have drafted a model bill that they feel would protect that segment of society uninterested in seeing sexually explicit material piped into the home over cable . That bill , he says , would prohibit the televising of what he characterizes as " depraved sexual behavior , " including " outright masturbation , open lesbian sexual behavior and sado-masochism . " Ward says that he sees no conflict between the provisions of the bill and free speech . " Whenever you protect the public , I can ' t consider that censorship , " he says . Erotic entertainment , he contends , has contributed to a gradual breakdown of the moral fiber of the nation to a point where it ' s " unsafe for a woman to walk the streets . " He points to a rise in teenage pregnancy , divorce , crime and a disregard for authority . He also claims that the porno industry has direct ties to the underworld . His bill to subject cable operators to a $5000 fine for showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state Legislature this yearbecause of the free speech question . In January , a federal judge in Utah struck down a more restrictive statute on constitutional grounds . That statute would have barred the showing of Oscar-winning " Kramer vs . Kramer , " for example . Industry insiders are opposed to the enactment of such restrictions , contending they should be allowed to regulate themselves . They note that cable operators in Massachusetts have chosen to show nothing seamier than R-rated movies . They also note that many municipalities , such as Boston , require that operators provide a mechanism for parents who wish to prevent their childrenfrom watching . More importantly , they argue that subscribers must request erotic entertainment and pay a premium to receive it . " You make an affirmative choice to take it , " says Paul Cianelli , head of the New England cable television trade association . Ward doesn ' t buy that argument . " Just because a few people want to buy something doesn ' t justify making it available to the entire community , " he says . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home and that there are many others in his group who share that view . He also says he doesn ' t believe his group ' s insistence on regulation is an infringement upon the rights of others . " There are a lot of things individuals want to do that are against laws " which could be construed as restricting their civil liberties , he says . Asked about concerns in some quarters that self-appointed moral watchdogs could have a chilling effect on personal freedom , Ward says that influence of groups like his is overstated . All that the group wants is to see that the rights of a " segment of the society that is often overlooked " are protected . " Outside of Little House on the Prairie , ' there is no other TV program that presents the traditional American family , " he says . " We ' re the ones that are being threatened and our freedoms curtailed . We ' re the ones not being treated fairly . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
