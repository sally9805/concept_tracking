History has not been kind to the Philistines . Exemplified by such figures as the hulking Goliath and the treacherous Delilah , they are depicted in the Bible as thieves and warmongering aliens . The ancient Egyptians branded them pirates and marauders . Since the 17th century , their name has been used as a synonym for uncultured , anti-intellectual boorishness . <P> But the Philistines ' battered reputation is in the process of being repaired . The revisionist view is emerging from the dust of the ancient city of Ekron , 20 miles west of Jerusalem , where archaeologists are busy excavating what was probably the greatest of the five Philistine city-states . The big news from the site is that the Philistines , whatever may have been said about them , were in fact one of the most highly civilized peoples of their time . They were successful industrialists and merchants , skilled producers of pottery and metal tools , sophisticated architects and town planners . " While they existed , " says Archaeologist Seymour Gitin , the American director of the William F. Albright Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link between East and West . They introduced a new culture in this part of the world . Eventually they became a great trading power and a powerful industrial nation with their individual style . " <P> The site of the excavations was first surveyed in 1923 , but it was not until three decades later that it was identified as Ekron ( peak population : 6,000 ) . The American-Israeli excavation , now in its seventh season , is uncovering a wealth of material in a 50-acre area that is helping archaeologists piece together a far more accurate  --  and flattering  --  portrait of the ancient Philistines . Says Gitin : " When we started digging at Ekron , it was as though we were opening a time capsule . " <P> The Philistines were a group of Aegean seafarers who arrived in the Levant region around 1200 B.C. , settling between the Israelite tribes to the east and the Egyptian empire to the south . It was a time of great political ferment . The Hittite empire was crumbling , and Greece was entering into 500 years of decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-director of the Ekron dig : " Their culture was a unique product of tradition and innovation in a time of international catastrophe . " <P> The Philistines forged a formidable reputation as warriors because they possessed a monopoly on iron smelting , and perhaps they even made steel . With advanced swords and shields , they fought the neighboring Israelite tribes , mortally wounded King Saul and stole the Holy Ark of the Covenant . In the face of the Philistines ' military threat , the powerful kingdoms of Israel and Judah united against them . Defeated first by David and then by the Egyptians in an alliance with Solomon , the Philistines went into decline in the 10th century B.C. <P> Their civilization enjoyed a remarkable revival during the 7th century B.C. , flourishing as a vassal state under the Assyrians . At the end of the 7th century B.C. , Ekron was conquered by the Babylonians , and the last traces of the Philistines ' advanced culture were eventually buried under farmers ' fields  --  until the archaeologists arrived .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
