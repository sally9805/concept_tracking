A kidnaped President is freed <P> Bolivia has undergone nearly 80 changes of government during its 159 years of independence , not even counting the 100 or more regimes that managed to cling to power for only a few hours . So citizens were not exactly surprised when they heard that , at 5 a.m. last Saturday , some 60 police and army recruits had pulled up to the presidential residence in La Paz , ordered a sleeping President Hernan Siles Zuazo from his bed and bundled him off to an undisclosed location in the 12,000 ft. high Andean city . <P> Siles ' troubles began right after his election in 1980 , when the armed forces prevented him from taking office . Two years later , following a general strike and a cutoff of U.S. aid , the military relinquished power and invited Siles back from his exile in Peru . But his coalition of four left-of-center parties , including the local Communists , has bickered incessantly ever since ; a series of economic mistakes , coupled with severe drought and flood , have brought the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 328% in 1983 , and could hit 2,000% this year . Although the treasury is bare and foreign banks have been calling for a solution to Bolivia 's $3.4 billion foreign debt , the country has yet to take the hard measures that would permit it to receive help from the International Monetary Fund . <P> Siles ' abductors were thought to be members of an elite police group known as the Leopardos , created to combat the country 's rampant cocaine trade . At first it appeared that Siles ' days as President were over . But the show of loyalty to democracy was impressive . A military communique stated that " the armed forces reject this attempt against the President . " The powerful Bolivian Confederation of Workers , which has been staging a series of strikes to protest worsening economic conditions , also declared its support for " constitutional order . " Scarcely ten hours after the incident had begun , Siles was found in a La Paz warehouse and was released .                @ @ @ @ @
