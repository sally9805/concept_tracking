" And now , my good fellow , you are beaten , And the county seat is placed in Wheaton . Your best plan is to take the old shell and rent her , For the county seat must be placed in the center . " In 1868 , Civil War veterans from Wheaton rode lumber wagons on a nighttime raid to filch county records from the courthouse in nearby Naperville . Prior to the raid , the two towns had waged a battle for possession of the county seat at every election for years . Naperville argued that it had a historic claim . As the center of the county , Wheaton argued that it had a geographic claim . Finally , in 1867 Wheaton won approval by the Illinois Legislature and built a courthouse , but Naperville refused to deliver the county records . When Wheaton ' s warriors returned with the booty  --  those records  --  the poem ( above ) was written to commemorate the event and read at Wheaton College . Although it is one of the many historic communities in Du Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newest and oldest towns in the west suburban area . For the first time in years , a large tract of vacant farmland  --  the 580- acre Rice Estate  --  has become available for development in Wheaton . It ' s an uncommon occurrence in a city landlocked by Glen Ellyn on the east , Winfield on the west , Carol Stream on the north and , of course , Naperville to the south . City officials must decide what to do with the large tract of open land , a dilemma that usually faces only new towns , while they also deal with issues such as the revitalization of their downtown area , a problem that usually plagues older communities . " That property offers the community a challenge , " said Donald Rose , Wheaton ' s city manager . " It will afford the community , which is basically a residential community , an opportunity to diversify its tax base . " Today , Wheaton is supported largely by its residential tax base . It has no heavy industry nor office parks and , although a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no major shopping centers to provide sales tax revenues . Of its $18 million total budget , about $2 million currently comes from sales tax revenues . Plans to develop the former Rice Estate include a mixture of uses  --  office , commercial and residential . The development is being guided by a local developer , Joe Keim . Rose said that no firm figures for the financial impact of the new development on the community will be available until plans are finalized . However , an early estimate of the future value of the property is $410 million , which would almost double the current assessed value of the entire community . Already approved is a 30-acre shopping center , named Danada Square for Dan and Ada Rice . The shopping center is expected to generate an additional $825 , 000 in both sales and property taxes annually . The property will be developed by Centennial Properties of Iowa . The city also has approved two residential subdivisions : the 97-acre Danada Farms North , which will have 260 single-family homes , and the 60-acre Danada Farms West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rice property , Wheaton also is in the process of assembling 70 acres for commercial and industrial development on its west side . According to Kevin Bowens , Rose ' s assistant city manager , Wheaton anticipates spending between $3. 5 and $4 million for acquisition and legal and planning fees . The 70 acres , now named Wheaton Park Manor Development Project , were divided into roughly 250 lots during the 1920s . Because of the diversity of ownership , the property was never developed . Like most suburbs , Wheaton ' s downtown has suffered from competition with regional shopping malls and strip shopping centers . Wheaton has put together an aggressive marketing campaign and offered a total of $8 million in industrial revenue bonds in the last two years to retain and attract new businesses . The city is working on a unified development program , storefront renovation and what Rose called a " general perking up of the area . " The aim in the downtown area , according to Rose , " is to encourage locals to shop their own downtown , and also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much more than a business district . It has a sense of community that goes back more than 100 years . The city ' s first families , the Wheatons and the Garys , encouraged its early growth by granting a five-mile-long right-of-way to the Chicago and Galena Railroad in the late 1840s . For years the railroad brought prosperity to the agricultural community by transporting its produce into Chicago . Wheaton was incorporated in 1859 . In 1853 the Wesleyans started the Illinois Institute , a college intended to stand against the evils of slavery , liquor and secret societies . The same year the Congregationalists took over the Illinois Institute and renamed it Wheaton College , which for years was better known than the city itself . The character of the community has been influenced greatly through the years by the college . In addition to 35-plus churches , Wheaton has attracted about three dozen church-related businesses . After World War II , mechanization and rising property taxes contributed to the decline of Wheaton ' s farming community . However , because of its easy access to Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . Its population rose from 7 , 389 in 1940 to 11 , 638 in 1950 . Wheaton ' s population had its biggest jump during the 1950s . By 1960 the population hit 24 , 312 . The most recent census , taken in 1982 , showed Wheaton ' s population to be 44 , 341 and still growing very gradually . Wheaton ' s housing stock remains largely single-family and owner-occupied . There are older frame , brick , stone or stucco houses and new houses in planned developments . The average price is about $110 , 000 , with the range varying from $50 , 000 to well over $250 , 000 . A Coldwell Banker study for the first half of 1986 said that the average sales prices of Wheaton ' s homes had escalated a healthly 10 percent since 1985 . The strong sense of community in Wheaton also is illustrated by the city ' s special programs , such as its financial assistance program for the elderly . Wheaton was one of the first communities throughout the metropolitan area to offer its long-time residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing . For qualified homeowners , the city offers property tax relief and for renters the city provides rent relief . The city makes payments directly to the county tax collector or the landlord on behalf of the elderly person . And although Wheaton does not have any current water problems , it was the first community to enact a conservation program 12 years ago . According to Rose , the program has allowed Wheaton to escape the water supply and quality problems that many nearby towns have suffered while awaiting the arrival of Lake Michigan water . According to Rose , Wheaton ' s tax rates have remained fairly constant in recent years . The aggregate rate was $7. 0279 in 1984 , of which the municipal rate accounted for $. 9632 . The school district , however , is at its maximum taxing capacity and is facing financial difficulties because of the declining school-age population . The school district has been able to avoid the closing of some facilities by cutting back on extracurricular activities such as music . A referendum to raise additional school taxes was defeated last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high schools , 2 high schools and a number of parochial schools . The student-teacher ratio is 8 to 1 and it the county ' s largest public library with 160 , 500 volumes . CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune Photos by John Dziekan .
