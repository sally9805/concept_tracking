Reagan 's $1.6 trillion defense program creates unforeseen problems <P> The full-page newspaper advertisement from Tenneco Inc. brimmed with pride . As its contribution to the Reagan Administration 's arms buildup , the company announced that it had delivered not one but two potent new neclear-powered warships to the U.S. Navy in a single day : the 93,000-ton aircraft carrier Carl Vinson and the 6,900-ton attack submarine Atlanta . Proclaimed the ads ' headline : MISTER PRESIDENT , WE HAVE BEGUN . <P> With a combined price tag of $1.63 billion , the cost of the two vesels is relatively cheap compared with the more then $1.6 trillion in defense spending that the Reagan Administration plans to lavish on American industry between now and 1987 . In addition to at least 130 new combat and support vessels for the Navy , the Administration 's shopping list calls for more than 3,900 jet fighters , bombers and transport aircraft , 8,880 tanks and cannon-carrying troop transports and , during the next decade , some 14,000 strategic and tactical bombs and missiles for the nation 's nuclear arsenal . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration 's strategic objectives may actually require more money than the President is proposing . Last December senior Pentagon staff officials estimated the shortfall at nearly 50% , or $750 billion . <P> For the major military contractors , the buildup will prove a bonanza . Many of them have excess factory capacity brought on by the recession , and they are already revving up unused production lines . Boeing , for example , which has been hard hit by the slump in domestic aviation , is at work on the cruise missile . <P> Even so , a growing number of economists have begun to warn that over the long term , the Administration may be asking for too much . The fear : that defense spending at anywhere near proposed levels will eventually create crippling bottlenecks at key choke points in private industry , reignite inflation and ultimately thwart the productivity surge that is essential for stable economic growth . Says Michael Evans , a Washington-based economist : " Until recently I assumed the economy could easily handle the buildup because of unused industrial capacity . Now I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through as proposed . " <P> It would be reassuring to think of multibillion-dollar defense contracts as a tonic for cash-starved U.S. industries . For years businessmen and the Pentagon have rightly urged Congress to take a long view in planning its defense expenditures , using multiyear procurement programs in order to ensure the steady and smooth development of new weapons systems . Unfortunately , the explosive new surge in defense spending is coming just when factories and financial markets will find it difficult to handle the strain . <P> The greatest pressure in all likelihood will fall on precisely those industries ( military aerospace , microelectronics ) that are already running near capacity . Later in the decade , as the buildup moves into high gear , the resulting resources squeeze could cause severe shortages of everything from strategic materials such as titanium and graphite to sophisticated specialty machinery and , especially , skilled manpower .
