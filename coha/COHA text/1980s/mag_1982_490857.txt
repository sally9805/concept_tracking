THE TAM OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFRIEND who lives in the Village writes : A new closet shop has just opened on Tenth Street between Sixth and Greenwich Avenues . It complements a wallpaper store that was recently stocked with towels of many splendid hues , on Sixth between Tenth and Eleventh , and two kitchen-gift shops already occupying considerable space on Tenth hetween Fifth and University . Tenth Street is the arena of the specialty shop . But the specialties are growing more varied : the ground floors of town houses are being taken over by therapists whose shingles hoist a name followed by a Ph.D. ? in one case , four Ph.D.s in a vertical row , with a modest M.A. thrown in for good measure . All the domestic mysteries that used to take place behind closed doors  --  closet , bath , kitchen  --  now have commercially available sources nearby , and the unconscious , the biggest mystery of all , has agents practically next door , ready to go to work at a moment 's notice . We have no grudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trou-ble of going uptown , that terra incognita all Villagers want to avoid . But streets and avenues have qualities unfathomable by reason alone , and when professionals move into a neighborhood as local as Tenth Street something ineffable is lost . The street has the simplest of virtues : attractive architecture , flourishing ginkgoes and plane trees , a human scale . In its ivy-covered bricks , its small front gardens , its planted balconies , elements of the campus and the city , the natural and the urban strike a rare accord . Tenth Street used to lie like an unopened envelope between Fifth and Sixth ; it had an air of seclusion , of mystery . And we associate mystery with privacy  --  our inclination and right not to know about our neighbors ' lives , and theirs not to know about ours . Tenth Street 's mystery is even simpler than its virtues : it says ( and , let us hope , continues to say ) that this is a place where people Ike , rather than a place where they vend , entertain , minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The View from Broadway WE did n't know until last week that New York is a great place for looking at outer space . We learned that from a NASA astronomer named Patrick Thaddeus , who works at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , at 112th Street and Broadway  --  a low-profile building that looks from the street like an average upper-West Side semi-tenement , which is exactly what it used to be . For anyone with a view of the roof , however , the silver dome of a brand-new **38;6632;TOOLONG radio telescope is a dead giveaway that something more than upper-West Side living is going on here . Dr. Thaddeus , a man of medium height ( five feet nine inches ) and medium age ( forty-nine ) , looks low-profile himself . On the day we went to visit him and his telescope , he was dressed in tan corduroy trousers , a green-striped shirt with three different-colored pens and one eyeglass case in the pocket , and fleet shoes , which permitted him to dart around his big airy office  --  from his desk to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orion Nebula and back to the desk  --  talking and demonstrating and chalking up equations with a Brownian intensity and economy of movement . This is actually upper Broadway 's second telescope , Dr. Thaddeus told us . The first one is seven blocks north , on the roof of a building at Columbia . We asked if the New York sky is n't too light and smoggy and cluttered for this sort of long-distance viewing . " Not at all , " Dr. Thaddeus said . " It turns out that at short wavelengths New York City is a wonderful observatory . We work in the very high frequencies , at a wavelength of about a tenth of an inch . That 's at the top of the radio hand , where the atmosphere is transparent . So far , there 's no commercial utilization to speak of  --  no microwave ovens or radio or radar . As far as we 're concerned , the New York environment is as quiet as it was when Henry Hudson came up the river . We are bothered by clouds a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw away half of the weather here , it turns out that the other half is somewhat superior to the average time at the top of a mountain out West . The secret is that we 're in the lee of a great continent . During the autumn and winter , cold , dry air comes down from Canada , from the area around Great Slave Lake . When we have these crisp , bright days here in the wintertime , the atmospheric conditions are wonderful for seeing . The signal does interact with water vapor , though . Radar , which is on a slightly lower frequency , can just barely slip through the clouds  --  that 's why it 's good for making weather maps . But we shut down from May to October  --  the good weather then is n't worth waiting for . The rest of the year , a hundred feet off Broadway is a dandy mid-latitude sea-level site . " The telescope , which is an exact replica of the one seven blocks north , is eventually going to he shipped to Chile , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Thaddeus and his associates have been making a survey of the chemistry of the Milky Way , and much of that starry band is visible only from the Southern Hemisphere . " Arthur Eddington , quoting his fellow-astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn , said that trying to understand the galaxy from observations in the Northern Hemisphere is like a bird 's trying to fly with one wing , " Dr. Thaddeus said . " Also , cloning an instrument  --  duplicating it  --  is a very efficient thing . For these reasons , taking an exact copy of our first telescope to the Southern Hemisphere struck us as a good idea , and the National Science Foundation agreed . " There was a look of triumph on Dr. Thaddeus 's face . " It was after Reagan , but we got directly from the N.S.F. one point two million bucks , " he said . This telescope will sit on the roof until sometime next year . " It will be debugged and checked out , and then , when it 's really working " ? Dr. Thaddeus paused dramatically ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry it . Not exactly in a suitcase but almost . Then we 'll plug it in and hope it works . " The telescope will help Dr. Thaddeus study nothing less than the chemistry of the universe . " We 're doing the first survey of the galaxy  --  of the universe , really  --  for organic chemistry , " he said . " It used to be thought that organic chemistry stopped about five miles above your telescope . Since 1945 , astronomers have discovered what they call the violent universe  --  ionized matter pouring forth at nearly the speed of light from supernovas and quasars  --  side by side with the universe of the stars , which are fairly stable . What radio astronomers discovered , which flies right in the teeth of this theory , is that there 's a third general state of matter  --  cold and serene  --  where the chemical bonding takes place . We 've found great clouds of molecular gases , and it 's in these . clouds that the chemical bonds really take hold . So what we 're doing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how much of this exotic stuff there is . And what we 're finding is that  --  contrary to expectations and predictions  --  a considerable part of the galaxy is chemical . " After all this , the telescope itself was something of a disappointment , to our nontechnical eye . It 's a silvery disc four feet across with a hole in the middle where the receiver will go . At the time of our visit , the receiver was in a thousand pieces , scattered around the workroom of Dr. Thaddeus 's research associate , a bearded young man named Richard Cohen . We did admire the way the telescope 's dome rotated  --  it rumbled like an I.R.T. train coming into a station  --  but what we liked best , we have to admit , was a demonstration by Dr. Cohen of the properties of liquid nitrogen ( nitrogen condenses at ? 350 ? Fahrenheit ) , which will be used to cool the receiver . He shot a little of the liquid into a Styrofoam cup from a compressed-air cannister and then turned the cup upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a splash of liquid come out of the cup , but it evaporated into the merest wisp of smoke before it ever reached the floor . Clusters THE richest cluster in the United States is called Blue Blood Estates , and it 's affluent/upper , suburban residential , predominantly white , with white-collar families with children , college grad and above , living in single-unit housing . It has a market rank of 1 on the " ZIP Quality , " or Z.Q. , scale . The largest cluster is Young Suburbia , with a profile like Blue Blood Estates ' but a Z.Q. rank of 8 , and it is followed closely in size by Bunker 's Neighbors , with a Z.Q. rank of 12 . Shotguns &; Pickups , Big Fish/Small Pond , and Back Country Folks are three clusters with below-average Z.Q. ranks ; lowest is Hard Scrabble , with a Z.Q. rank of 40 . According to Jonathan Robbin , a social scientist turned businessman , who invented these clusters , they are market-rating classifications based on the theory that " the demographic variables that define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? in other words , that " you are where you live . " Mr. Robbin and his colleagues at the Claritas Corporation built the cluster model of the United States in three number-crunching steps . First , they sorted the 1970 United States Census data by Zip Code , noting a thousand variables for each of the nearly thirty-five thousand six hundred Codes . Second , they analyzed five hundred and thirty-five basic measures of Zip-neighborhood characteristics , which fall into five " domains , " or groups ( social class and affluence ; family life cycle ; mobility ; ethnicity ; housing style and degree of urbanization ) , and , in the process , discovered thirty-four key factors that account , in statistical terms , for eighty-seven per cent of the " variance between neighborhoods at each Zip level . " Finally , they rated all the Zip Codes on each of the key factors , and instructed a computer , using all thirty-four scores simultaneously , to group the Zip Codes and the neighborhoods within them into distinct , homogeneous clusters . As a company report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest Cluster centroid in thirty-four-dimensional , statistical hyperspace . " We took this in on a visit to the main Claritas offices , which are in Virginia , right across the Potomac River from Washington . A map on the wall of Jonathan Robbin 's office provided an example of how he has put the forty clusters to use . The map covered the blocks in Zip 10019 ( between Forty-ninth and Fifty-ninth Streets , and Fifth and Twelfth Avenues , in Manhattan ) . Each neighborhood was marked in one of six colors , which flagged its cluster identity ( Money &; Brains , Urban Gold Coast , Bohemian Mix , Emergent Minorities , Dixie-Style Tenements , or Urban Renewal ) and its potential for consumption ( the Urban Gold Coast areas , southeast of Columbus Circle and on either side of Sixth Avenue , had the highest ; Dixie-Style Tenements , just east of Twelfth Avenue and a few blocks south of Fifty-ninth Street , had the lowest ) . The Claritas map charted the blocks ' potential for consumption of yogurt , so that , knowing the cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a client interested in opening a yogurt store near Radio City could pick the best spot . With each of the United States Census 's two hundred and seventeen thousand block-groups classified by cluster , Claritas can provide a similar map of any area in the country , for almost any product . Claritas also serves as a consultant on direct-mail advertising for magazines ( Field &; Stream does well in Shotguns &; Pickups ) , door-to-door sampling , and other forms of pinpoint , or targeted , marketing . Jonathan Robbin , a solidly built man in penny loafers , a baggy suit , and glasses with small tortoise-shell e , . frames , beamed when we asked him how the Claritas system worked . Around him were shelves of books like " Clustering Algorithms " and " Mathematical Taxonomy , " an Apple II Pius computer , and an open briefcase containing cluster printouts and a pocket calculator , along with a notepad from the Caracas Hilton  --  tools of the trade that the energetic Mr. Rob-bin has developed during twenty-nine years of applied social science . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm the kind of fifty-two you are after working twelve hours a day for too many years " ) and his company 's income ( " Let 's just say it 's a fat seven-figure number " ) , and , swivelling in an old wooden chair , gave us a tour of the machines that turn the Claritas data into graphs , charts , and maps . Then he described what he thinks the company has accomplished . " The world 's a cellular phenomenon , and you can look at it in different ways , " he said . " Botanists parse the world in terms of taxonomy . In geodemography , we use a statistical process of pattern recognition to break the world into significant units , which are basically neighborhoods . What we 've got is a one-hundred-per-cent idea of the United States . We study aggregates of areas to look at the life style of the people who live in them . Where you live , we 've discovered , is the crucial issue in your social status , and it 's beautiful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . You can go to sleep in Fairfield , Connecticut , and wake up in Pasadena , California , but our system proves that , except for the palm trees , you 're really in the same place . " Jonathan Robbin became fascinated by cluster analysis in the fifties , when he helped a geologist at Columbia University classify fossils and sediments from the Bahamian seabed according to salt content , temperature , and depth . Later , on assignment for the Office of Economic Opportunity during the Johnson Administration , Mr. Robbin found that " the federal system held a wealth of information at an aggregate level , " and he used the data to draw a social profile of every county in the United States for O.E.O. He also began to work in earnest on a plan that eventually yielded the Claritas Clusters . Now his company 's daily affairs are handled by others , Mr. Robbin went on , so he has time to experiment with the clusters . He has explored the political uses of clusters , and has deals with two firms ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign strategy . " You know the basic constituencies in politics  --  blacks , veterans , businessmen , women ? " he said . " They do n't exist . The real interests are in the community . The true coali tions form according to life style . Now , if you took these facts to their extreme the result would be outrageous . You 'd have political redlining . Some candidates might try to build a constituency of elites . The implications are tremendous . But the clusters portray reality , and we have to live with them . " His hand whirling , Mr. Robbin continued , " You get cluster-whipped doing this all the time . But this stuff is amazing , as an artifact of society and a triumph of engineering , if nothing else . " lie slid his chair forward , grabbed some papers from the desk , and said , " Look at this . Blue Blood Estates has the country 's highest Z.Q. and only point six per cent of the people in the U.S. , but that cluster holds sixty per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pea-pie who live in the cluster take more than eight times as many international business trips as the national average . They give almost six times as much money to hospitals , and spend four times as many days playing tennis . And look what they do n't do . They buy one-tenth the number of truck-mounted campers , because they can afford to stay in fancy hotels , and a third the number of forty-fiver.p.m. records . And they buy forty per cent less cough syrup , because they get their medicine from private doctors . Want to see the other end of the spectrum ? In Hard Scrabble , they 've got forty per cent more cats than the national average , because cats like mice , who like grain , which you can find in rural places ; they do n't have many burglar-alarm systems ; and they buy a quarter again as many forty-five-r.p.m. records . " Jonathan Robbin stood up and spun his chair . " That 's it , " he concluded . " That 's what we do . " Telecast TELEVISINC opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amounts of money , steel-nerved singers who can play to the cameras and the audience without shortchanging either one , and a director who combines technical skill and musical knowledge with a theatrical sense of story line . We arrived at these conclusions on a recent Saturday afternoon after watching Kirk Browning , a gifted and resourceful television director who specializes in musical events , prepare a telecast of the Metropolitan Opera 's sumptuous new production of Puccini 's " La Boheme " for an audience that was estimated at twenty million people . In recent years , television has begun to provide opera with a more intimate , cinematic point of view and with an enormous new public . The Met " Boheme , " for example , was sent live by satellite to Europe and Chile and Venezuela that same afternoon and shown throughout the United States on tape the following Wednesday night . Our first encounter with Mr. Browning , a lean , intense man with white hair and startling black eyebrows , took place one evening earlier in the week , in a large , boxlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the Metropolitan Opera House . He met us at the door and showed us the electronic equipment that had been packed into a remarkably small space : a director 's console at one end , bristling with television monitors and switching equipment , and a video-equalizing room at the other end , which enabled technicians to shade and paint the shots selected by the director so that the colors matched . Sound , he told us , was mixed sepaFEBRUARY 1,1982 rately , in an audio booth inside the house , and English subtitles were added from a Chyron machine in another truck . We knew that Mr. Browning was about to tape a " Boheme " performance as a dress rehearsal for the telecast , and we asked how he had prepared for that project . " When it 's a new production , stage action is often difficult to pin down , because it is n't set until quite late , " he said . " I watched rehearsals and made a single reference tape of the piano dress rehearsal on the house camera from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well break down the opera into picture sequences that will be photographed from the various camera angles that I know exist in the house . Tonight , I 'm working from a rough shooting script  --  that 's a typed libretto with camera shots written next to the dialogue . " " Where are your cameras ? " we asked . " Normally , we can cover any stage action with six cameras , " Mr. Browning replied . " Four of them are stationed along the front of the auditorium two at the outside corners of the orchestra pit and two shooting up from the center aisles . Two others shoot down at the stage from parterre boxes on opposite sides of the house . For this production , Franco Zeffirelli , the director of the opera , wanted to see certain long shots of the center of the stage , so we added a seventh camera , in a center box , which can zoom in on the action or pull back slowly for a long shot of the entire stage . Then I added a safety camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole show and can take over if I should have trouble . " " What did you learn from the reference tape ? " we asked . " I cleaned up some sight lines , " said Mr. Browning . " I 'm going to shoot Teresa Stratas , our Mimi , from a higher angle , because it 's more flattering , and use my two low cameras at the front of the house more than I 'd planned , because I 've discovered that they can shoot up over the Paris rooftops in Acts I and IV to get some very interesting material . Gil Wechsler , the lighting designer , has promised to increase the lighting in the cafe and soften it up a THE NEW YORKER 35 bit in that wonderful Act III snow scene , and I 'm going to pull back and use the center camera for long shots whenever I have a blessed moment . In television , it 's hard to make general mood-setting shots pay off , because the camera is gratuitous until you get into character relationships and specific storytelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Act II . I have to tell a very fast-moving story in specific pictures  --  the cameras must pick out the main characters as each one sings , so it 's going to be tough to catch the chemistry of the environment , the ebb and flow of Parisian life that goes on around them . " Air time approached , and we folded ourself into a corner of the truck as Mr. Browning put on a headset and a pair of silver-rimmed glasses anti sat down at a desk facing a wall of television monitors . There was a large color set at the top , which transmitted the picture that was being taped . Below it , eight smaller , black-andwhite monitors showed what each of the cameras was photographing . On Mr. Browning 's left sat his associate director , a tall , blond man named Alan Skog , who lined up each camera in advance , to make sure that a shot was ready when Mr. Browning called for it . On his right sat the technical director , Rizz Augugliaro , pressing buttons and switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain rose on two bohemiansRodolfo and Marcello  --  in their freezing attic , Mr. Browning began to prowl across the set with his cameras , panning left from a smoking chimney with a sidewise hand movement , signalling a dissolve from a balcony to the interior of the attic with a circular motion of his right arm , cutting between waist shots of Rodolfo and Marcell ? with sharp finger snaps . As the act progressed Mimi arrived with her candle , and Rodolfo fell instantly in love  --  we began to get a sense of Mr. Browning 's style . He usually began a sequence with several rapid medium shots ( " Camera 5 on Rodolfo as he opens the door ; Camera 4 on Mimi in the doorway " ) and then moved in for more leisurely closeups during the arias ( " Tighten up on Mimi when she sits in the chair " ) , changing cameras at the end of a musical phrase . The next day , Mr. Browning told us that he was planning to stay up most of the night working with David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe ) , to restructure the camera shots . " What I have to do is to balance the story line for an audience that is seeing Boheme ' for the first time , " he said . " I 've got to find a way to make a sequence of shots that gives the proper weight to the various relationships that are going on in the caf  --  Mimi with Rodolfo and his friends ; Marcello with Musetta , his former love ; Musetta with Akindoro , her elderly lover  --  without being disorienting . Basically , I 'm going to have to decide how I see these relationships , and stick with it . " Two days later , when we arrived to watch the live telecast , Mr. Browning told us that he had completely reorganized the cafe scene . " I 've reduced the number of cuts  --  they were disorienting  --  and I 've put in as many long shots of the entire stage as I can find room for , " he said . " Camera 2 is having a hard time locating Mimi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the crowd to sing their first lines . So I 've told him to focus on 11,1arcello , who is visible , and to pan left . We also have to shoot a foot higher than we did at the dress , because the stage wagons  --  those enormous platforms that slide in car-rying scenery  --  are stuck and wo n't sink to stage level . " The telecast , which began in an atmosphere electric with tension , went well , despite a brief blackout of Camera 6 caused by a malfunctioning headset . The main characters in the Caf ? Momus were outlined clearly against a larger tapestry of Parisian life ; the haunting snow-drenched meeting between Rodolfo and Mimi took place beneath warmer light and smaller snowflakes ; and Mimi 's death , in the squalid garret , was caught in a series of agonizing closeups by three cameras , one of which followed her arm as it fell , lifeless , to the side of the bed . As the curtain came down , Mr. Browning pushed back his chair and mopped his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suor Angelica ' in 1953 , " he said . " You know , when we began , three hours ago , I was n't sure whether what I 'd come up with was a solution or an expedient , but now that I see it working on camera I think maybe it is a solution . "
