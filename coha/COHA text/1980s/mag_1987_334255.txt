It is still a gamble to launch a new columnist on the nation 's editorial pages . That is true even when the new man , A.M. Rosenthal , has just stepped down from editing the New York Times . Forget the power he once wielded ; his words must now compete from scratch with other columnists ' across the country . <P> Transferring success as an editor to the quirkier demands of columning is not automatic , and Rosenthal 's first columns , going out to the 300 U.S. newspapers that subscribe to the New York Times News Service , have a way to go . But Rosenthal , starting out on a new career at 64 , is characteristically sure that he can successfully write about foreign affairs , love " or whatever else is in my head , and I hope it 's not too lonely up there . " <P> In this he reflects an attitude increasingly common in newspaper columning , an ambition to personalize the news rather than to report and reflect on it . This requires a strong ego , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ego seems to have come almost from birth to two columnists conspicuous for it , William F. Buckley and George F. Will . Buckley is the beneficiary of an oil-rich upbringing and a thorough grounding in Roman Catholic thought . Will 's father was a college professor , and George was presumably encouraged to air his youthful opinions at the dinner table . After all , a columnist is expected to be wise on short notice , and is tempted to make judgments that are quick and flat , or they will leave no mark . Anyone who writes a column twice a week is unlikely to be rendered wordless by what he does not know . <P> The columning field is overcrowded these days and no longer as prestigious as when heads of state waited to see what Walter Lippmann had to say . Lippmann , who died in 1974 , was far from infallible , but he had a grave , ruminating authority that no one now writing has . But then , in journalism as in everything else , such authority today is suspect . Op-ed-page editors feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on too many subjects , and frequently prefer to commission articles from specialists who know one field well . <P> In the age of television , newspaper columnists seem diminished stars among the power groupies in Washington . Will regards himself primarily as a writer , but it is his TV appearances that put him in the big money . Moreover , a columnist is expected to be pigeonholed politically . The Gannett chain advises its 92 daily papers to pick columnists whose views range a broad spectrum  --  from Mary McGrory 's spirited liberalism , say , to James J. Kilpatrick 's avuncular conservatism . But positioning is n't always enough : even in the age of Reagan , Jeane Kirkpatrick and Norman Podhoretz have not built significant reputations .
