Expressing concern about the overall message conveyed in the Tower Commission report as well as its specific revelations , the officials said the report ' s most damaging aspect was the impression that Mr. Reagan had not exercised adequate control over the situation . This , the officials said , must be the image the President combats. // Officials said a speech had been tentatively scheduled Wednesday , but Mr. Reagan will decide if he wants to deliver it only after he has finished reading the report. // // ' Repentance and Resurrections ' // Officials said it was virtually certain that Donald T. Regan , the White House chief of staff , would resign , and there were also reports that two potential candidates to replace him , former Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada and Drew Lewis , had ruled out the possibility. // " It may well be necessary for him to demonstrate deep disappointment , even condemnation of certain actions and individuals , along with his willingness to take responsibility , " one senior White House official , who asked not to be identified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The media love crucifixions . But the American public loves repentance and resurrections. " // Responding to the report in an interview , Vice President Bush agreed that it would be " wrong " for the United States to trade military arms to Iran for the release of American hostages . But he insisted that the Adminstration had no such intention. // If the Tower Commission concluded that this was an arms-for-hostages deal , Mr. Bush said , then he would have to disagree . Page A10 . Officials said the report would increase the pressure on Mr. Reagan to replace his chief of staff . The President will make a decision in the next few days , officials said. // The President , however , was reported to be having difficulty finding a replacement. // Mr. Laxalt , a longtime associate of Mr. Reagan , released a statement tonight in which , according to The Associated Press , he ruled out a White House post because he was considering a Presidential candidacy in 1988 and could not promise unequivocally to remain at the White House until the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President today to tell him that I did not feel it would be appropriate to accept a position in the White House , " the statement said. // Mr. Lewis , another close associate of Mr. Regan who served as Secretary of Transportation and is the chief operating officer of Union Pacific , has also taken himself out of the running , according to unidentified sources quoted by The A.P. and The Washington Post . . <> <> Other Officials Criticized // In issuing the report , which senior White House officials received at nearly the same time as the President and as it was being made public , the commission also criticized several other top Administration officials , including Vice Adm . John M. Poindexter , the former national security adviser , who it said " failed grievously " on the matter of the diversion of funds to Nicaraguan insurgents. // In addition , it said that William J. Casey , the former Director of Central Intelligence , had not explained risks to the President in having such a policy initiative conducted by the staff of the National Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some instances of the roles of Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. // Mr. Reagan received the report after a 60-minute private meeting with the three-member commission , headed by former Senator John G. Tower . Officials present said he received a briefing with an expression of concern on the findings as he sat between Mr. Tower and former Senator Edmund Muskie . The President asked several questions but made no substantive comments , said one participant. // Mr. Regan , who usually sits close to the President , was on the other side of an oval-shaped table , at the very end , taking notes . Some officials saw it as yet another indication that his departure was imminent , although several sources said that Mr. Reagan would not make a decision until he meets with some close advisers on Friday . <> <> ' Try to Be Businesslike ' // The issuing of the report disrupted normal White House business , even though Mr. Regan had told senior aides at the morning staff meeting to " try hard to be businesslike today. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from relief on the part of some aides who were glad the report was out , to clear concern on the part of others . Referring to some senior aides , one official said : // " They appear clinically dead ; they are obviously depressed " // White House officials said Mr. Reagan was setting the stage for taking the responsibility for the Iran policy initiative in the brief remarks that he made in introducing the Tower panel . The President said he intended to read and digest the report and to " think carefully about its findings and promptly act on its recommendations. " // In addition , he pledged to " do whatever is necessary to enact the proper reforms and to meet the challenges ahead . " <> <> Question of Acceptance // But some senior aides said that it was still uncertain if the President would fully accept the judgment of his Presidential commission and if he would also see the need to change the detached leadership style that before now had served him well. // " Clearly some of them think he ' s got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s said to date , " said another senior aide. // The commission ' s report contained harsh criticism of Mr. Reagan , saying that he did " not seem to be aware of the way in which the operation was implemented and the full consequences of U.S. participation . " In addition , it suggested a serious failure in Mr. Reagan ' s management style by leaving the principal responsibility for policy review and implementation with advisers. // " Nevertheless , with such a complex , high-risk operation and so much at stake , the President should have insured that the National Security Council system did not fail him , " the report said ( in Part IV ) . " He did not force his policy to undergo the most critical review of which the N.S.C. participants and the process were capable . <> <> No Response to Report // " At no time did he insist upon accountability and performance review. " // The White House had no response to the report today and officials said there would be no substantive public statements until the President made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it even canceled the normally held White House press briefing. // Mr. Reagan had urged the appointment of the commission in the hope of getting an independent assessment of what went wrong in the Iran-contra initiatives , which White House officials stressed today . <> <> ' Second Elective Surgery ' // " Today was Ronald Reagan ' s second elective surgery this year and like the first , there is a lot of pain and you ' d rather not go through it , but it ' s absolutely necessary , " said a senior aide . " And it ' s better to do it now than to wait until you have no choice. " // Mr. Regan , the chief of staff , had hoped that the report would exonerate him of wrongdoing in the Iran-contra affair . The document all but clears him of any illegal acts . But the report faulted the management style of the former Wall Street executive , who was the chief officer at Merrill Lynch &; Company , a leading investment concern. // " He , as much as anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the report said . " In addition , he especially should have insured that plans were made for handling any public disclosure of the initiative. // " He must bear primary responsibility for the chaos that descended upon the White House when such disclosure did occur. " // But some White House officials challenged that conclusion by saying that it was unfair , since Mr. Regan did not have control over the National Security Council ' s staff . They said Frank C. Carlucci , Mr. Reagan ' s new N.S.C. adviser , had made that point at a meeting of the Tower board. // While the tough tone of the report surprised some officials , others said it was necesary to make the review credible. // One adviser , who attended a meeting on Monday at which the President met with several senior aides , said that Mr. Reagan had displayed reluctance to respond forcefully . The adviser said he hoped the report would " jar " Mr. Reagan into acting. // Mr. Reagan is scheduled to spend the weekend at the White House and several sources said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime advisers , including Mr. Laxalt ; William P. Clark , a former national security adviser , and Stuart Spencer , a political consultant. // Mr. Regan was absent today as Mr. Reagan spoke briefly at the start of the Tower Commission ' s news conference , although senior aides said that he had not given any indication on whether he will resign. // Because of the report and opposition from Nancy Reagan as well as some other advisers to the President , officials said today that it will be virtually impossible for the chief of staff to remain . " He ' s a goner , " one aide said today . " Since he ' s been there , he ' s been saying L ' etat c ' est moi , " the official said . " But unlike Poindexter and North , he wouldn ' t fall on his sword , " he added , referring to the two officials who have departed the staff of the National Security Council , Vice Adm . John M. Poindexter and Lieut . Col. Oliver L. North. //   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
