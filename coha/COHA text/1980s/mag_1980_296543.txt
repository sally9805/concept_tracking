Sadat leaves and Begin arrives to talk about the settlement <P> For more than an hour , the two men sat under a magnolia tree in the Rose Garden and talked . Yellow legal pad in lap , Jimmy Carter did more listening than speaking . They met again that afternoon with their advisers present , then by themselves the next morning . The meetings , as Press Secretary Jody Powell observed , were " very warm , " and at the state dinner held that night in his guest 's honor , Carter himself jokingly alluded to the admiration he felt for his visitor . " I 'm thankful one man is not running against me , " the President said . " How would you like to run against Anwar Sadat ? " <P> Thus , as expected , the Egyptian President 's meetings with Carter in Washington last week proceeded amicably , though the two leaders appeared not to have settled on a strategy to resolve the problem at hand : how to revive the moribund Egyptian-Israeli negotiations on granting autonomy to the 1.2 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Concerned that the May 26 goal for the autonomy talks , as set by the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty , was fast approaching , Carter last month had invited both Sadat and Israeli Premier Menachem Begin to confer with him separately in Washington . <P> Sadat told Carter that he was prepared to try to ease Israeli fears about military security by working out an arrangement to demilitarize the West Bank and Gaza during a five-year transition period . He suggested that joint Egyptian-Israeli patrols or international forces could keep order . Sadat urged Carter to put pressure on Begin to stop planting settlements in occupied territory on the West Bank . The settlement program , he said , " generates hatred and friction . " <P> <P> When Begin arrives this week to talk with Carter , he is expected to demand , as steadfastly as always , that his country keep its military forces in the occupied lands during the transition period . He also plans to defend , as always , the settlement program : " This is not only our right , but it is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our national security , and we must settle . " To strengthen Begin 's hand , the Israeli Cabinet instructed the Premier to discuss only those proposals contained in the Camp David accords , thus technically ruling out any negotiation of the settlement policies . Begin 's basic argument is that Israel must protect itself against attack , and it was reinforced last week when Palestinian terrorists struck a kibbutz along the Israeli-Lebanese border . <P> About the best the Administration can hope for from Carter 's talks with Sadat and Begin is that the three leaders will agree to instruct their negotiators - Sol Linowitz of the U.S. , Interior Minister Yosef Burg of Israel and Premier Mustafa Khalil of Egypt-to convene in Washington for a final round of intensive negotiating . The May 26 date could readily be waived if substantial progress is being made . But if these tripartite talks turn out to be unsuccessful , White House officials are unenthusiastic about calling another Camp David summit meeting and thus putting the President on the spot to provide a settlement . In this election year , no one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains for some presidential diplomacy unless a round of happy handshakes is promised as the finale .
