The long road to deficits has been paved with the best of intentions <P> The federal budget cuts proposed by the President look crisp and bloodless when summarized in tidy charts and statistical tables , but it is a very long way from the Latinate language of program descriptions to the bumpy realities of people and places those Washington moneys touch . Though inevitably some were born of boondoggling and horn-swoggling in the give and take of American politics , most federal programs were conceived with the best of intentions , created to advance goals on which much of America agreed . To feed the hungry . To heal the sick . To train the jobless . To enable the nation 's youth to go to college . To help American business compete abroad . To further the arts . To preserve the family farm . But whether misused or effective , each contributed to an ever growing cascade of federal largesse that the nation can no longer afford . TIME correspondents examined a sampling of current programs across the nation , assessing how they worked and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worked Up over CETA <P> Joseph Lilley , 41 , drives a van for Erie Independence House , a home for twelve handicapped people in Erie , Pa . He earns $4 an hour for a 40-hour work week , and his salary is paid by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act ( CETA ) , the federal jobs and job-training program founded in 1973 . With four children and a wife on welfare , Lilley considers himself lucky to hold the CETA-funded post . " Before this job , I was on welfare , " says Lilley . " I probably would have trouble finding another job because I have a prison record . CETA helps people like myself get going again . " <P> Not any more , if the Reagan Administration succeeds in its plan to abolish CETA programs across the nation . In Erie , Lilley is one of 500 people currently paid by CETA and working for such nonprofit agencies as the Y.M.C.A. and the Red Cross or learning job skills in local training programs . In addition , CETA funded summer jobs for 500 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ending Sept. 30 , Erie will receive $5 million from CETA -a welcome transfusion for a decaying industrial city that is hemorrhaging jobs . The unemployment rate in Erie now hovers at 9.5% , against a nationwide rate of 7.4% . The Holiday Meat Packing Co. closed its doors for good two weeks ago , leaving 230 jobless ; the Continental Rubber Works , which employs 320 , will shut down soon . <P> Many Erie officials , not surprisingly , condemn the proposed slashing of CETA funds . Says Mayor Louis Tullio : " It 's going to have a drastic effect on the nonprofit agencies , on the services they provide , and on the city of Erie . " R. Benjamin Wiley , executive director of the Greater Erie Community Action Committee , which administers CETA programs , is even more vehement in describing the impact . " There 's going to be more crime and more homicides , " warns Wiley . " The bottom line is that if these programs are cut , you 're putting more people out there on the unemployment line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of money . "
