The biggest corporate brawl in history could be nearing an end . Thanks in part to the negotiating skills of TWA Chairman Carl Icahn , a settlement may be at hand in the epic legal battle between Texaco and Pennzoil . Since 1985 Texaco has been appealing a court order to pay Pennzoil $10.5 billion in damages as a result of a merger dispute . In April , Texaco filed for bankruptcy protection . Enter Icahn , who three weeks ago became Texaco 's largest stockholder by boosting TWA 's holdings to 12.3% . Icahn helped forge a deal between Pennzoil and a committee representing Texaco 's shareholders to settle the conflict for $3 billion . Texaco 's management blasted the plan , but may have to go along if its shareholders approve . Icahn stands to reap rich profits , since Texaco 's stock could surge once the firm emerges from bankruptcy .
