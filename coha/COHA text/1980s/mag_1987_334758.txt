Promising to expand the Reagan revolution , New York Congressman Jack Kemp plunges enthusiastically into the presidential race . This is the fourth in a series of profiles of the major 1988 contenders . <P> The candidate strode genially from table to table , hands outstretched , making fingertip contact with smiling ladies at a luncheon in Manchester , N.H. An elderly woman grabbed him by the sleeve and yanked him to her side . " There are too many foreigners buying up our land , " she complained . He bent down next to her chair . " Aw , come on , " he chided , " do n't look at it as a zero- sum game . We want people to invest in America . " She listened sullenly as he tried to explain his vision of an unfettered free market . " Well , you think about it , " she interrupted , shaking her finger . He masked his exasperation with an affectionate pat on the back . " I will , " he promised , " but you think about it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Congressman and former pro- football quarterback ( for the Buffalo Bills ) , once thought he would end up as a coach or teacher . Even now that he is campaigning for President he can not suppress the urge to enlighten , to pounce on a negative outlook and offer an optimistic economic vision in its stead . His fervent embrace of the supply-side faith and its feel-good gospel of growth is more than just a political platform . It is a personal creed that has fueled his career and helped him develop a blend of conservatism and blue-collar populism that he sees as the natural extension of Ronald Reagan 's legacy . <P> The past year has been troubling for Kemp 's campaign . His hope of turning the Republican race into a Kemp-Bush contest failed ; though Iranscam deflated George Bush 's lead , Robert Dole emerged as the main alternative to the Vice President . As Kemp makes his formal announcement this week , there is whispering that his candidacy ca n't get off the ground . <P> Part of Kemp 's problem thus far has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When proselytizing about his economic theories  --  the virtues of tax cuts , the need for currency reform and a dollar " as good as gold "  --  he displays the earnest exuberance of a junior professor addressing a pep rally . Beneath the hearty veneer and football-star luster , Kemp harbors a curious personal reticence . When asked what his appeal is to voters , he answers , " I think my ideas are popular , and I think I can articulate them as well as anyone . " <P> The ebullient Kemp , a conservative mirror image of Hubert Humphrey , loves to talk . When he is minutes into a speech , his head bobs back and forth , as if straining against a too-tight collar and tiepin . He plants his feet far apart and unfurls his arms , flexing his fingers to pantomime an expression like " quote , unquote . " He speaks so quickly , using so many facts and historical allusions , that he often fails to engage his audience . His aides have given him a digital stopwatch to remind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
