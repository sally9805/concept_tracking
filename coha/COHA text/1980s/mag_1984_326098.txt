A surprise enrollment surge triggers a campus housing crunch <P> After counting noses for fall registration , a fair number of colleges are just beginning to come out of shock . The U.S. Department of Education had been signaling that enrollments would be on a downslide as the supply of 18-year-olds shrank from a 1979 high of 4.3 million toward 3.2 million in 1994 . But when the students showed up last month , some of the crowds clamoring for Lebensraum were so outsize that dozens of schools had to scramble to find beds for everyone . <P> Boston University , confronted with a 13% surplus of 496 new students , put up most of the spillover for two weeks at the Sheraton Boston . Eventually more conventional quarters were scrounged up , and B.U. swallowed a $200,000 tab . The University of California , Santa Cruz , counted some 200 freshmen above the normal entering class of 1,340 . The school handled the crush in part with a freshly bulldozed trailer park , where some 30 students are currently making do with their mobile digs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten to 20 students checked in every night in the first few weeks for an issue of bedding , to converted dormitory lounges with beds trundled in to create communal pads . " I was kind of bummed out about it , " says Freshman Robin Chase . " But it 's pretty nice , they gave us a nice space . " <P> Despite the push , there were signs that this fall 's boomlet was only a spotty phenomenon . Most institutions in the South and the Rocky Mountain states were doing the slow business that had been predicted nationwide . On the other hand , many of the first-choice colleges , such as Stanford , the University of Chicago and the Ivies , have enrolled more freshmen than expected . <P> College officials hazard varied reasons for their windfalls . " The economy is doing better , " suggests Boston University Administrator David Hollowell , " and parents seem to feel comfortable paying for private schools . " Moreover , admissions deans were counting on so-called summer melt from students who keep their options open by accepting places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would actually come . " The ghosts showed up , " says Middlebury 's associate admissions director , Herbert Dalton . In addition , at some schools fewer upperclassmen are leaving to make room . The dropout may be fading out . In today 's tough job market , observes Dartmouth Admissions Director Richard Jaeger , " there seems to be a growing sense of urgency to start college and stay in college . "
