Kohl inspires confidence abroad but raises worries at home <P> Like Ronald Reagan , he is a folksy , conservative politician with an easygoing , leisurely work style . But last week , West Germany 's newly chosen Chancellor Helmut Kohl , 52 , was behaving like a man without a moment to lose . Within three hours of taking over the glass-and-steel Bonn Chancellery from Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt , the Christian Democratic leader had sworn in a new 17-member Cabinet , chaired his first Cabinet meeting , held a press conference and jetted off to Paris for a hastily arranged get-acquainted dinner with his most important Western European partner , French President Franois Mitterrand . Kohl 's Foreign Minister , Hans-Dietrich Genscher , hopped another jetliner for New York City , where he sat down for preliminary talks with U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at the United Nations . The aim of all of this brisk activity was nothing less , in Kohl 's words , than " to demonstrate to the world the continuity and viability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kohl is whether or not he will be allowed to lead that government for long . After ending 13 years of Social Democratic coalition rule on Oct. 1 by toppling Schmidt in a Bundestag no-confidence vote , Kohl and his center-right coalition of the Christian Democrat/Christian Social Union ( C.D.U./C.S.U. ) and the Free Democratic Party ( F.D.P. ) have all but promised to hold elections by March 6 that could toss the newcomers out of office . <P> From the moment he was sworn in as Chancellor , Kohl tried to assure West Germans that he would continue the foreign policies of Schmidt 's government , including support for the installation of U.S. intermediate-range nuclear missiles in the country . " The Americans are our most important partners and allies , " he told the press conference , but then quickly added that the transatlantic relationship means " friendship and partnership , not dependency . " Kohl gave a critical edge to that remark by referring to the gas pipeline from the Soviet Union that a consortium of Western European nations is financing and building despite the protests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the U.S. was still selling grain to the Soviets while leveling sanctions against European firms that were working on the pipeline . Said he : " One should not demand of the other what one would not like to have demanded of oneself . " Kohl also reaffirmed West Germany 's longstanding trade relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , and said that he would like to meet with his opposite number in East Germany , Communist Party Chief Erich Honecker , " at the earliest good opportunity .
