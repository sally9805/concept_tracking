txt Apparently fearful that the air traffic control system is becoming strained , government officials are preparing to order a major cutback in airline operations . Industry sources said Drew Lewis , Secretary of Transportation , and J. Lynn Helms. administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration , alerted airline presidents to the possible cutbacks at a private board meeting yesterday in Washington of the Air Transport Association , an industry group . Airline operations , which are pushing close to 70% or 75% of normal at 22 major airports . may be cut back to 50% , the level originally ordered by the government following the air controllers ' strike that began Aug. 3. the airline presidents were told . One industry source said that Messrs . Lewis and Helms indicated the cutbacks would be ordered effective Oct. 25. when the industry makes seasonal changes in schedules . Another source said the government cutback would become effective Dec. 1 . Attempts to reach Messrs . Lewis and Helms last night were unavailing . A spokesman for Mr. Lewis , however , stated that the secretary did tell airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutbacks will be ordered . But specific percentages of cutbacks were n't used , the spokesman said . Sources cited two reasons for the possible cutbacks . First of all , government officials believe that some of the airlines have been trying to " cheat " by reinstating too many flights , one source said . Under the current FAA rules , carriers are limited to 50% of normal operations at the 22 major airports . but they may request permission to restore certain flights . If FAA computers indicate that a flight can be handled , an airline is granted permission to make the flight . " Everybody has been trying to get a little more than their fair share , because if you get more than you fair share then you 're doing better than the next guy , " one airline executive said . " Some carriers have n't been playing ball , " said an official at another airline . " You look at how many flights they have now compared to what they had before the strike and you can tell there 's been some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said the airline has operated fairly under the rules , conceded that the airline was able to restore 60 flight segments to its schedule . Because of such maneuvers , several major carriers are operating nearly 90% of their scheduled departures , throughout the U.S. A second problem causing concern is general aviation . Some sources said small aircraft have begun flying again in large numbers , putting the system under strain . One airline official emphasized that there seem to be no unusual dangers in air traffic control immediately . " The government guys are worried about the long-term capability of the system , " he noted . " They see things coming up like relief for controllers who have been working long hours , normal vacations for controllers , bad winter weather and heavy travel during the coming holiday period . " He added . " the government wants to keep this system squeaky clean , so they 're looking ahead . " Thus far the air traffic control system has worked better than most expected . The cutbacks at congested airports have smoothed aircraft operations , permitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pilots . In addition . the controllers now working have received high marks from pilots , leading to increased cooperation between controllers and pilots .
