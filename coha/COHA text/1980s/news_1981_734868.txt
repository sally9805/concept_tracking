txt @ ? I am writing about a problem I am having with Summit Equipment of Akron . Last Sept. 11 , I sent the firm a money order in Mt payment for a catalog item . I sent a money order because the catalog said that personal checks delay shipments . After quite some time , , the package finally arrived via United Parcel Service but it was COD . Paying the UPS driver would have meant paying twice . I wrote a letter to Summit explaining all this and they sent me a letter claiming they have the right to keep both my money and the item I Ordered because of the shipping cost . As you can see on the enclosed order blank , there is no mention of shipping charges other than for overseas orders . All that is requested is a $1 charge for orders under $10 . I included that . I think that it is pretty underhanded for a company to send a prepaid order COD , and then keep the custom ? er 's money . Can you inspire Summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part ? Roman Robaszewskl , West Eddy Street A ? Sorry , but you should have read the large print on the front inside cover of the Summit catalog . Under the heading " shipping " it states , " all prices in our catalog are freight out bound ( FOB ) Akron . The shipping charges are not included in our prices . " The shipping charge was close to the price of the item you ordered . Q ? Can Action Line prompt a little action from the city to have a tree removed from our parkway ? The tree was tagged for removal three mouths ago . This tree has cost me $150 for sewer rodding and the neighbors next door had to have theirs rodded recently , too . I ca n't afford this as I am a senior citizen on a idw pension . The city is responsible for this tree and it should be billed for any future cost to me . We have called repeatedly and all the city does Is give us the runaround . Mrs. H. Winberg , Augusta Boulevard A ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , according to John , deputy commissioner of . the Department of Streets and Sanitation . Q I need a gasket for my Presto pressure cooker . I have written to the company twice , but never got a reply . The cooker is still good . I am 75 years old and need that heavy-Auty gasket badly . See if you can move those people . I will be glad to send them a check , money order , or stamps . Adolph H. , Cicero A ? " We are at a loss fcir excusable reasons why the . customer has not received a reply in two attempts of communication " said Gene Moe , factory service manager for National Presto Industries . " However , we will be happy to send the requested sealing ring promptly . "
