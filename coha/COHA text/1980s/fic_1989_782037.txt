 | He glanced east . The sun was coming up , spilling light over a brown , barren landscape blasted by summer heat and dry weather . The South Korean engineer mentally ran over the amount of work that would be required , pursed his lips , and said , " If I have my men start now , we should be able to break in by midday . " The American nodded and the two men studied the borehole in silence for a moment longer before turning away back down the valley toward their waiting jeep . Captain Lee 's estimates were , like everything else about him , precise . Chadwick noticed the silence first . For six hours since daybreak the valley had been filled with a high-pitched , grinding whine as South Korean drills ripped their way into the ground , opening a path for the explosives that would break through into the suspected North Korean tunnel . He 'd watched avidly for a time , but his interest had waned as the sun rose higher and the temperature climbed , and he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drills had stopped . Chadwick sat up suddenly and pulled the latest issue of Stars and Stripes off his face . He stared through the windshield as combat engineers unreeled thin detonator wire from the enlarged borehole to a sheltered spot near where the trucks were parked . After a moment Lee stood and gave him a thumbs-up signal . The charges were in place and wired to go . He clambered out of the truck cab and ambled over to where Lee lay waiting with his noncoms . The Korean grinned up at him and gestured to the plunger . " Care to try your hand ? " " Nope . You blow things up . I just take pictures of ' em . Before and after . " Lee chuckled , motioned him to the ground , and then pushed the plunger . Borehole Five-A erupted in a fiery pillar of smoke and thrown rock debris . A muffled roar rumbled through the valley and shook the earth . Lee and his troops were up and running toward the hole before the dust even settled . Their explosives had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its narrowest point . Most importantly , it did not seem to have a bottom . Shining a powerful light straight down revealed only a circle of darkness . They were in . Lee took an old Korean War  --  vintage M3 submachine gun  --  a " grease gun " ? from his sergeant and slung it across his back . He looked at Chadwick . " I 'm claiming the honor of going down first . Care to accompany me ? " The sweat stains under Chadwick 's arms suddenly felt ice cold , but he shrugged and asked , " Do we get to use a rope ? " Lee grinned . " Naturally . Only Marines are forbidden to use ropes , Captain . " " Terrific . " Chadwick checked the clip on his regulation-issue 9mm pistol .  | He did n't like this commando stuff . What if the bad guys were waiting down there for the first flies to drop into their parlor ? Desk jockeys like him were supposed to analyze North Korea 's tunnels , not invade them . But he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd be damned if he 'd let Lee see that he was scared . He and the engineer had been partners now for months and they 'd made a good team . Chadwick did n't think that would stay true if he chickened out now . He watched while Lee stepped to the edge of the hole , clipped a line onto his belt , and signaled his men to lower away . The South Korean dangled momentarily and then disappeared through the narrow opening , looking intently downward . Moments later , Lee called up for them to stop . The end of the line came back up , and Chadwick stepped to the edge . They lowered him slowly past the jagged sides of the hole that kept threatening to snag his battle dress and then on down into the darkness . He swallowed hard and tried to concentrate on mentally recording what he was seeing . It was the best way he knew to push away the fears his subconscious kept raising . For the first fifteen meters the hole was nearly circular , but then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an hourglass , and he was swinging in the air . Chadwick realized that the blasting must have caved in the roof of the tunnel . He looked down . Ten meters ' worth of rock littered the floor below him . He touched down on the uncertain footing and scrambled for a moment to get his balance . Something grabbed his arm and he jumped , feeling the adrenaline rush pulsing through his system . It was Lee , steadying him . " Jesus Christ ! " he whispered . " You scared the crap out of me . " " Sorry . " Lee let go and stepped back , swinging his light around in an arc to cover the tunnel in front of them . They had broken through the roof near the end of the tunnel , but well over to one side . The passageway itself ran north-south and was at least thirteen meters wide , big enough for a three-lane road . Away from the area currently under construction , the floors , walls , and ceiling had all been smoothed . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only Lee 's flashlight and the sunlight ( x , rtring down through the explosives-torn shaft provided illumination ? look ing much like eerie spotlights in the dusty air . More men were swarming down the ropes now , some carrying weapons and others demolition gear . Chadwick whistled softly as he saw crate after crate of explosives being stockpiled off to the side . " How much will it take to destroy this underground freeway ? " Lee cocked his head , studying what he could make out of the tunnel through the darkness and still-swirling dust . " Perhaps as much as a thousand  | kilos of C4 . It will take us most of the day to wire the charges . This could be the second largest freeway ' we have ever found . " He smiled wolfishly and shrugged . " Who knows ? If we time it right , we may be able to catch the communists as they return to their work this evening . " While Lee 's men lowered their equipment through the narrow opening to the surface , the two captains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted men . The engineers needed security while they worked , and Chadwick wanted to get a good look at everything before it was too late . His nervousness had evaporated with the absence of opposition . Now he had a job to do . " What 's that on the wall ? " The American stopped as his flashlight hit a painted line of Hangul characters . Lee stepped closer . " It says that this is the Socialist Awareness ' tunnel . " The South Korean sounded both amused and disgusted at the same time . " Well , it 's the Socialist Awareness ' tunnel for about six more hours . Then it 's going to be the Socialist Collapsed Hole in the Ground . ' " Chadwick raised his camera and snapped a picture of the nameplate . They 'd already come three hundred meters from the entrance without seeing much of anything . Just the smooth rock walls and floors , an occasional ventilation shaft , and now this painted sign . It looked peaceful , but every step brought them closer to North Korean territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row of dark , boxy forms blocking the passage in the distance . Heavy construction equipment ? That did n't make sense . You did n't use bulldozers to build tunnels . They picked up the pace a little , closing on the shapes . They walked another twenty steps or so and then Chadwick pulled up short . In a very soft voice he said , " Oh , shit . Captain Lee , tell me those are n't what I know they are . " His flashlight pointed up and outlined the rounded form of a tank turret , and another one next to it , and another one next to that . Three tanks , with their turrets pointed aft , in travel position , were parked abreast in the tunnel . Lee whirled and shouted something to a private , who took off running . Chadwick understood just enough Korean to understand " colonel " and " more men . " Smart move . Get the brass and get reinforcements . Nobody had ever found any equipment parked in a tunnel before . Son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shined his flashlight down the passage between the tank and wall . Yep . There was another tank past this one , and one past that , and on until the light was lost in the darkness . Chadwick stood and stared , drinking in every detail . A long-barreled 115mm main gun . One 7.62mm coaxial machine gun . A heavy machine gun mounted on the turret for use against aircraft and helicopters . An infrared searchlight mounted near the main gun . There could n't be any doubt about  | it . These were Soviet-model 1-62A main battle tanks . And here they were sitting in a North Korean tunnel , inside South Korean territory . A wild feeling of exultation swept over him . This was an intelligence officer 's dream . He wanted to do a hundred things immediately and could n't decide which to do first . Steady , Marc , old boy . Deep breath . He inhaled and exhaled slowly , then looked at Lee . " Any chance we can open up that hole and get some of these guys out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to do that when he arrives . If we work fast , we should be able to make it . Some of the men in my company are qualified tracked vehicle crewmen . " Chadwick leapt up onto the vehicle deck and looked for the gas filler cap . He opened it , delighting in the action the way a child might delight in working a new toy . " Empty , naturally . " " We can have diesel fuel here in about forty-five minutes , " Lee said . " Do n't worry , Captain . It will take us several hours to drill and blast a ramp . Chadwick was climbing all over one of the tanks , opening its hatches and peering inside , when two colonels one an American and the other South Korean  --  arrived , followed by a panting squad of heavily laden riflemen . The opportunity was just too good to pass up , so he stood at attention on the deck , saluted , and grinned at the two senior officers . " It followed me home , sir . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the South Korean combat engineers , Colonel Miller , just shook his head . " Report , Captain . " But Chadwick could see the ghost of a smile flit across Miller 's face . Chadwick jumped down and saluted again . " Sir , there 's at least a battalion of armor parked in the tunnel . All T-62 tanks , parked three abreast . Standing up on the deck there , you can see them going back until the light runs out . They are n't fueled , but they do have main gun ammunition . " " All right . Get the men checking out the vehicles for documents and other portable intelligence . Do n't forget external markings . I understand we may be able to recover some of these ? " " The engineers think so , sir , " Chadwick said , nodding to Lee . The Korean was heavily engaged with his colonel , who was nodding and smiling . " Then let 's get on with it . You and Captain Lee take your party down the tunnel and see what else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further than one-half klick , starting from this point . Consider this the line of departure , but do n't start a war , Captain . " The warning in the colonel 's voice was real . " Yessir . " Chadwick waved over to Lee , who had just saluted his own departing colonel . It was the first time he 'd ever seen a Korean field-grade officer move at anything except a dignified walk .  | They moved forward slowly , an officer in front on each side , followed by three heavily armed enlisted men . Chadwick looked at his watch . It was just two-thirty in the afternoon . Topside it was ninety-five degrees and climbing , but the tunnel was as cool as his basement hack home . Their handheld flashlights provided the only source of light . The tunnel had taken many slight bends since they had entered , and more since the start of the equipment . Probably done to avoid difficult rock formations and to confuse anyone trying to plot the progress of the tunnel from above . In any event , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the habit of calling out " Photo " before he took a picture . That gave everyone a chance to cover their eyes and avoid the painful flash . Lee concentrated on the tunnel itself , doing a hasty survey of distances and directions . Chadwick counted tanks . There were thirty-one , the book strength of an armored battalion . Behind were trucks , jeeps , and all the other hardware . Someone with an orderly mind had put this stuff in here . He could almost predict what would come next . What the hell was all this stuff doing down here in the first place ? There 'd always been speculation that the North Koreans intended some of their tunnels as more than just infiltration routes into the South . But this kind of confirmation was spectacular and completely unexpected . It did make a twisted kind of military sense , though . Stockpiling gear like this in advance would cut down the preparation time needed to launch a major attack across , or under , the DMZ , and it would lower the warning time available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how could the North Koreans have possibly thought this kind of gear could just lie here undetected , year in and year out , until it was needed ? He filed the question away for further consideration later . There was just too much to do right now . After the tanks the vehicles were only parked two abreast , leaving one lane open . Chadwick guessed that the fueling trucks were next , and he was rewarded by the sight of large , fat-bodied tankers designed to carry the diesel that T-62 tanks guzzled by the gallon . They marched along through the trucks , passed a row of towed 122mm field guns , and suddenly came out into just empty blackness . They stood facing north , looking into the tunnel , regarding the dark and wondering what else was there . Lee spoke first . " I think we should continue on , Captain . We should find out what else is down here . " " How far have we come so far ? " " Only about five hundred meters more . It is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border . " Chadwick felt his excitement fading a bit , allowing a dose of reality to creep back in . " Yeah , but we 're under the DMZ now . Come on , Captain ,  | we 've captured a communist armored battalion without a shot being fired . Let 's quit while we 're ahead . " Tom between his orders , common sense , and curiosity , Lee stood still for a moment and then shrugged in resignation , " All right . Should we survey this equipment then ? " " Yeah . I 'd like to have Corporal Rhee assign men to copying license plates and markings and stuff . You and I can start looking for the command tank . It 's probably back toward the ? " A tremendous BOOM rolled down the tunnel followed by a CLANG from one of the nearby vehicles . For one microsecond Chadwick thought they had started blasting up the tunnel , but the clang did n't fit . Then the pieces fell together : a shot echoing from ahead of them and a bullet ricocheting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shouted , " Hostiles ! Cover ! " He dropped back behind the bulky tires of one of the towed artillery pieces . Without thinking , one hand switched the flashlight off , and the other drew his pistol . He did n't even know it was out until he tried to work the slide while still holding the flashlight . Stay cool . Chadwick took a short breath , held it , and crouched back farther behind the tire . All the lights were out , except for one that had been dropped and had rolled into the open center of the tunnel , throwing strange , distorted shadows onto the smooth rock walls . Chadwick could still hear the echoes of that first shot bouncing down the tunnel . Before it faded away entirely , a new burst of fire struck around the dropped flashlight . Bullets spanged off the floor and ricocheted into vehicles and the walls . One slammed a South Korean private onto his back in a widening pool of red-black blood . Another threw a man forward , his hands clutching vainly at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh shot hit the light and shattered it . The tunnel plunged suddenly into an eerie , half-lit darkness . And in the silence Chadwick heard voices echoing from ahead . North Korean voices . Flames stabbed out of the darkness , muzzle flashes growing larger as the North Koreans charged forward . They were firing from the hip , spraying rounds across the tunnel . Lee 's men shot back , aiming at the flashes , and Chadwick saw bodies tossed crumpled to the rock floor as bullets caught them . But the attackers were still coming . He flattened as a point-blank burst tore rubber fragments off the tire above him and whiperacked overhead . Jesus ! The North Koreans were too damned close , and there were too damned many of them . He felt the fear clutching his guts , urging him to stand up and run . He fought the temptation . Running was the quickest way to get killed . Something heavy thumped against the tire and Chadwick rolled away to the side . Still rolling , he saw a strange combat boot and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his AK-47 assault rifle up and around to fire . Oh , God . Chadwick 's finger tightened convulsively on the trigger of his pistol . It roared once and then again and again as he squeezed off rounds without thinking . Four . Five . No more , his brain screamed . Chadwick took his finger off the trigger and he looked at the twitching ruin his bullets had made . Two rounds had ripped into the North Korean 's stomach , eviscerating him . The third and fourth , climbing higher as the pistol bucked upward , had torn through the man 's chest . The fifth and final round had blown a gaping hole in the North Korean 's throat . Chadwick felt his own stomach lurch and he swallowed hard against the sour taste of vomit . He 'd never killed a man before and did n't like the feeling . He wormed backward behind another tire , away from the corpse . Safe in cover again , he stared wide-eyed at the scene around him . Bodies littered the tunnel floor , some lying in twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were moving . Chadwick felt his self-control returning . His hearing was coming back , too . It was hard to tell , but the gunfire seemed quieter somehow . He shook his head , trying to clear the ringing in his ears , and listened more carefully . Then he risked a quick look around the tire and saw Lee on the other side of the tunnel , backlit by the muzzle flashes from his submachine gun . Nobody was shooting back . Chadwick waited for a few seconds more to make sure and then bellycrawled over to where Lee crouched , staying low and hoping that the surviving South Koreans were n't firing completely blind . He tugged on Lee 's belt and pointed down the tunnel , yelling , " That 's it ! They 're all dead or bugged out ! " He had to repeat it twice to make himself understood above the din . The South Korean engineer nodded , pulled a whistle out from around his neck , and blew three short blasts . Cease fire . Cease fire . The shooting died away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders in Korean and walked warily with his men out into the open . M 16s at the ready , they moved among the motionless bodies , checking for wounded . There were n't any . Four South Koreans were dead and nine North Koreans lay sprawled beside them . Blood trails showed where others had been dragged back into the pitch-dark tunnel . Chadwick moved over to Lee , his pistol still in hand . He felt oddly calm , as if the firefight had happened to an entirely different person . " Captain , you and I both know that was just a patrol . But you can bet they 'll be back any minute with the whole goddamned army . " " I agree . We must mine this equipment in place and destroy it . I 'll send for thermite and explosives . We can wire everything in five minutes once it arrives . "  | Chadwick looked at the bullet holes ripped through one of the fuel trucks and then shook his head wearily . " Shit , I hope we 've got that long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel from behind them . Iliree troopers came clattering up carrying a machine gun and ammunition . Ihey flopped down to the floor about ten meters past the vehicles and started setting up . The machine gun had a large tube on top that Chadwick suddenly realized must be a night-sight . Jim-dandy . If the North Koreans came back , at least the MG would get the first shot . He watched the engineers at work , marveling at the way they disregarded safety instructions and normal procedures . Cases of C4 were placed on the hack of each vehicle and simultaneously wired . Thermite charges were scattered around , and a large number of cases were simply piled on the floor . They worked as quietly as they could , but they had to use lights , and Chadwick knew what kind of target they must make . They were still working when a sound like tearing canvas echoed down the tunnel . The machine gun team had opened up . Lee shouted something and the men started working even faster , not placing any new charges but wiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the tunnel with it , back toward the opening . The machine gun 's fire was being answered now , with single shots and short bursts of automatic fire . Chadwick saw a round shape roll out of the blackness and dove for cover behind an empty , bullet-shredded fuel truck . WHUMMP . The floor rocked as the North Korean grenade exploded , spraying fragments through the machine gun crew . The gunner screamed once and fell back dead . His two loaders lay badly wounded beside him , and the machine gun itself was a twisted wreck . Then the carnage disappeared from view , cloaked by a wall of acrid , lung-searing smoke that now filled the tunnel  --  cutting visibility to just a few meters . Hundreds of rounds buzzed past and tumbled bouncing off the walls . It seemed impossible to move without being shot . Both sides were firing blind as fast as they could reload . More South Korean troops arrived , hurdling the prone combat engineers still frantically placing and wiring charges . Several were hit in midstride and collapsed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover they could find  --  truck tires , empty explosives crates , or bodies  --  and opened up . Chadwick stayed where he was and looked for Lee . The engineer squatted nearby , his face a mask of concentration as he wrapped wire around a lead . Lee finished tightening it and glanced up . He flashed a thumbs-up signal in Chadwick 's direction and reached for another charge . Something blared sharp above the gunfire , and Chadwick 's mind rocked . A bugle . My God , he thought , the North Koreans are still using bugles.  | Suddenly he felt very close to his father , who 'd told him about the human-wave attacks launched during the Korean War . He clutched his pistol tighter . WHUMMP ! WHUMMP ! WHUMMP ! More grenades went off in rapid succession , thundering down the tunnel , showering the defenders with deadly fragments . More dust and smoke followed , turning everything into a hazy nightmare . A squad of North Korean soldiers charged out of the smoke , urged on by their bugler . They were cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them and the bugle kept blaring . Chadwick heard screams and yells of defiance rising from the men around him . A burly South Korean sergeant rose from behind a truck , stood braced against the recoil , and emptied his M16 's magazine into the oncoming North Koreans . Four of them were knocked backward , their bodies , faces , and limbs disintegrating as the bullets slammed home . But then the sergeant was down , chopped nearly in half by an AK burst . Time blurred as the fighting moved to close quarters . Chadwick saw a North Korean run past , helmeted head down , pounding straight toward the engineers still working . He aimed quickly and fired twice . The soldier staggered and then slid dead to the tunnel floor . He spun round as another came from the side , assault rifle swinging high to smash his skull . Chadwick dodged right and felt the rifle butt hammer his left arm . He gasped at the pain and fired once into the man 's stomach . The North Korean folded in on himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left arm . It felt on fire . " Captain Chadwick ! " He looked up in a daze . There were bodies everywhere in sight , sprawled like torn rag dolls across the tunnel . Lee motioned to him again . They were leaving . Several soldiers were still firing into the haze , trying to pin the North Koreans down , but the others were backing away  --  hauling their wounded with them and staying low . Chadwick scuttled over to the South Korean engineer . " You done ? " The smoke hanging in the air burned his throat . Lee nodded vigorously . " Everything is wired . " He jerked a thumb south toward the exit . " I suggest that we get out of here while we still can ! " The bugle shrilled again from down the tunnel . Shit . The harsh rattle of AK-47 fire grew louder , and new shapes appeared out of the haze . Another North Korean attack . One of Lee 's men turned to yell a warning and pitched backward , shot directly between the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burst down the tunnel , wincing as the recoil jarred his left arm . One of the North Koreans dropped in a spray of blood . The others scattered , seeking cover . " Come on , Captain ! This is no time for heroics ! " Lee put a hand on his  | shoulder and pulled him away . A bullet cracked past his face , bringing him back to his senses . The engineer was right . It was past time to leave . Together with the other rearguard troops , they turned and headed down the tunnel  --  moving as fast as they could without unnecessarily exposing themselves to enemy fire . The bugle continued to sound behind them . They reached the first row of T - 62s before the North Koreans realized they were going . Rounds started to slam into the vehicles and the rock around them . Jesus . Chadwick and the others all broke into a flat-out run . Something tugged at his sleeve and he saw the man running in front of him fall , a stain spreading across his battle dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , trying to drag him to his feet . He could n't do it . " Leave him ! He 's finished ! " Lee screamed in his ear over the gunfire and pulled him onward . Chadwick obeyed . They ran on , letting the fear they were feeling flow into their legs . Harsh cries and the slap of running feet echoed down the tunnel from behind them . Panting , they rounded the last bend and saw sunlight from the opening in the roof along with something even more welcome  --  two rope ladders dangling , waiting for them . Chadwick did n't even break stride . He hit the ladder four feet up and started climbing . The pain in his arm suddenly did n't matter at all . The troops waiting above exhorted them on , while Lee 's sergeant marked their progress from a detonator box . As soon as their shoulders cleared the opening , they were grabbed by a man on each side and half-dragged away from the hole . When they were well away , the sergeant screamed a warning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very neat explosion . First , only a small , muffled boom , then a thundering roar , then a series of several teeth-rattling THUDS . The rippling lasted for a few seconds , and then a shock wave too loud to be called a sound slammed them into the ground . Flame , smoke , and shattered rock toppled away from the hole in slow motion as the ground subsided into a shallow , crooked gully leading north . The tunnel had collapsed . Chadwick decided he really did n't need to get up right away , and he lixiked over at the rest of the men , who were in various stages of befuddlement . Lee shook his head like a punch-drunk prizefighter and lay panting on the ground . After a while Chadwick levered himself to his feet and walked over to stare at the man-made gully that had become the graveyard of an entire North Korean armored battalion and its security detachment . He stayed motionless for several minutes and only gradually became aware that Captain Lee had joined him .  | Lee smiled wanly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , we were able to catch those communists after all . " Chadwick looked at him for a moment and then turned back toward the collapsed tunnel . " Yeah . We caught ' em all right . " Then he swung around to stare into the Korean engineer 's eyes . " But doing what ? " He looked down at the ground , as if he could read the enemy 's intentions by scrutinizing the bare , weathered rocks and the sun-browned grass . But any answers they held were buried as deeply as the crushed remains of the North Korean tanks .

" AUGUST 25-PYONGYANG , NORTH KOREA One hundred and fifty kilometers north of the DMZ , the capital of the communist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea lay sweltering under a merciless afternoon sun . Like all artificial creations , Pyongyang 's every aspect reflected its builders ' innermost beliefs and priorities . The city was an amalgamation of endless rows of drab , look-alike apartment towers , broad but empty boulevards , idealized , larger-than-life statuary , and massive , colonnaded government buildings . Propaganda banners flew from every gray , slab-sided building , exhorting passersby to " Strive Harder for the Fatherland , " reminding them that " Work Is the Sacred Duty and Honor of Citizens , " and calling them to " Self-reliance Through Collective Action .

Only the required pin or button bearing Kim Il-Sung 's portrait added any touch of bright color to their garb . Despite the glaring sun , they moved briskly from place to place , careful never to show undue curiosity and never to seem idle . The Democratic People 's Republic was a workers ' state and its people were expected to work . There were reeducation and labor camps aplenty for those who could not or would not learn that . The nerve center of this sterile , humorless city sat at the end of a wide , empty avenue  --  a towering edifice of gray stone and grayer concrete , more a fortress than an office building .

Open displays of emotion were regarded as unproductive and suspect , and supposed friends could easily become bitter rivals , always on the prowl for an indiscretion , a traitorous whisper , or the slightest sign of disloyalty to the State and its Great Leader .

As a result , work on the other tunnels would have to be stopped  --  at least until the Americans and their South Korean puppets had again been lulled into a false sense of security . Kim Jong-Il could feel his carefully laid plans slipping once more into the distant future , and that was something he was unwilling to contemplate . He had always been impatient .

But so long as Kim Il-Sung lived , his son 's enemies were powerless to move against him . More than forty years of absolute rule had enabled the elder Kim to build a nation shaped in his own image and governed by his slightest whim . Kim Jong-Il knew that kind of power could not be inherited , it could only be earned  --  forged over time his enemies would not give him , or forged in the fires of a war , a common struggle against the hated American enemy . His own enemies inside the government had already tried to move against him once . Kim felt a small chill as he remembered the bomb planted aboard his father 's personal train . A bomb planted by officers loyal to General Oh Chin-U @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faction inside North Korea . The assassination attempt had failed , and the known conspirators were either filling unmarked graves outside Pyongyang or slaving away in special camps . Its aftershocks , however , were still rippling through the Party , the Army , and the Foreign Ministry . Kim Jong-II smiled thinly to himself . Not all the effects had been bad . He 'd used China 's suspected involvement in the bomb plot to persuade his father to side more closely with the Soviets . That had been an essential move . Only the Soviets had the kind of advanced weapons the People 's Army needed to match the Americans and their Southern puppets . But Kim held no illusions about the motives of his Russian backers  --  they did n't believe in charity . They believed in power . And every high-tech weapons system the Soviet Union gave or sold the North increased its hold over Pyongyang . At some point it would be too late to go back . He and his father would have sold their precious self-reliance for radar-guided missiles , modern battle tanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew the risks well . After all , what was life but a succession of risks  --  some greater and some smaller ? Better to view the game as a race . A race between Soviet domination and military strength . A race between his plans for the war that would secure his position and an assassin 's bullet or his father 's failing health . And now one incompetent officer had threatened all the preparations for that war . The fool . He should have had the man shot . Kim twisted uncomfortably in his chair . There had to be something he could use to distract the attention of the imperialists . Something that would cause trouble for their lackeys in Seoul . Something that would drive a wedge between them . He picked up his phone and started calling for files . He would work until he found what he was looking for . It was well past dawn before he found it .  | AUGUST 29 ? PARTY HEADQUARTERS , PYONGYANG , NORTH KOREA Kang Hyun-chan sat carefully in the high-backed leather chair , bald head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in space . The long , curiously effeminate fingers of his age-spotted hands rested unmoving tin gray , peasant-style cotton trousers . Beneath his fingertips Kang could feel the damning evidence of his seventy years  --  his stick-thin , withered legs . Legs that had once been strong and wiry enough to carry him up and down Manchuria 's rugged hills during his days as an anti-Japanese guerrilla . He smiled wryly . He 'd fought for the Party all his adult life , first as a soldier , then as a spy , and finally , as a master of spies . And none of that mattered . Not now . Not here . He had been ushered into this immaculately furnished office by an unsmiling bodyguard , ordered to sit down , and left waiting for nearly half an hour . He could hear water running in the small , adjoining washroom . Kang recognized the game that was being played . He 'd played it often enough himself during forty-odd years of service as a member of the Central Committee 's Research Department . The silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to unnerve the subordinate on whom disfavor had fallen , or was about to fall . His predecessor as director of the Southern Operations Section must have had a similar meeting before he 'd been " retired " to special work farm . For a moment Kang felt a surge of anger at the unfairness of it all . His predecessor had blundered badly , and his blunders had embarrassed the State . But he had done nothing wrong . He 'd heard the rumors of Kim 's rage over the tunnel catastrophe , but that was n't in his area of responsibility . Why this meeting then ? With difficulty he pushed the anger away . It would n't help him in the next few minutes , and it might make things worse . Kang had always been something of a fatalist . The position he 'd attained carried great rewards , and with great rewards came commensurate risks . It was the way of things , and no amount of carping or whining would change it . " My dear Kang , how good it is to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plump , cherub-faced son of the Great Leader , Kim I1-Sung , bustled out of the washroom smiling from ear to ear . Kang was astonished . This pleasant greeting was not at all what he had expected . He stood hastily and bowed to the man known throughout North Korea as the Dear Leader . Kim moved around his desk and waved Kang down into his chair . " Sit ! Sit ! My dear Kang , this is no time for formality . This is a working meeting . A meeting of two old friends and comrades who 've worked hard to preserve our Revolution , eh ? "  | Kang sat slowly , thinking fast . What did the man want ? Aloud he said carefully , " Dear Leader , I am honored by your kind welcome . " Kim settled himself ponderously in his own chair . He 'd inherited his father 's stocky build , but unlike his father , he 'd never been forced by trying circumstances to forgo the delicacies that could add pounds . Kang found the contrast between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would one day rule them interesting . But he was careful to leave the thought there . Irony could be a swift road to oblivion in the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea  --  especially for a man in Kang 's position . " Tell me , Comrade Kang , you 've been following recent events in the South ? " " Yes , Dear Leader . " What did the man think that he did all day ? Read film magazines ? " Excellent . Then tell me , Comrade , how you would analyze these events . Specifically , these massive student protests in Seoul . " Kim folded his hands over his stomach and rocked back in his chair . Kang could n't read anything in the man 's expression . He took refuge in the time-worn language used in official propaganda and shrugged . " It is the old story , Dear Leader . The summer Olympics and orchestrated elections bought the Seoul regime a small measure of peace , but the progressive elements are once again trying to pressure the imperialist-controlled puppet government for significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kang shook his head . " Nonexistent . Uncoordinated street protests are of little use against an entrenched fascist occupation . " What was the man driving at ? Kim Jong-II sat forward in his chair . " Why then are we not doing more to assist these progressives in their cause ? Surely you see these demonstrations as an opportunity . As a chance to bring these students into a united front against the American oppressors and their lackeys . " Oh , oh . Kang wondered which of his rivals had been filling Kim 's head with such nonsense . Too many carefully placed agents had already been " blown " in futile , wasted efforts to control South Korea 's seasonal student protests . He 'd better squelch this dangerous line of thought while he had the chance . " Naturally such a development would be welcome indeed . Unfortunately , most of these students have not reached the proper level of revolutionary consciousness . They want reunification with us , but they 've been unwilling to accept the discipline needed to make that happen . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last round of demonstrations . The benefits do not yet outweigh the costs , Dear Leader . " Kim 's smile faded into an impassive , unreadable expression , and Kang  | thought it best to temporize . " Naturally , we continue to reevaluate each opportunity as it arises . " Kim 's smile came back . " I am delighted to hear that , comrade . I have always known you to be a man of great sense . " He gestured airily . " But of course I shall accept your advice on this matter as the last word . We 'll leave these Southern students to their own devices . " Kang dipped his head in gratitude . It was a rare thing to be able to so easily persuade the Dear Leader to abandon a pet proposal  --  even one so cautiously advanced . " Tell me , how is the Scorpion Project proceeding ? " For a moment the rapid change of subject took Kang by surprise . He looked at Kim carefully . This must be what he had really been summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rioting students had been a blind , a way to ease into something much more important to Kang and to the Research Department  --  the Scorpion Project . In a way the Scorpion Project was Kang 's special pride and joy . It had occupied him for most of his career , and in fact , it had carried him to the upper echelons of the Research Department . Scorpion was an agent  --  a deep-cover agent planted in South Korea in 1950 , during the confusion caused by the North Korean invasion . Beria , Stalin 's feared KGB chieftain , had first suggested it to Kim 11-Sung as an insurance policy against military failure . He believed that it should prove comparatively simple to build an airtight " legend " or cover for such an agent amid the ongoing devastation , slaughter , and chaos . He had been right . The man known by the code name Scorpion had been recruited , carefully trained and indoctrinated , and then sent south through the enemy lines  --  armed only with the identity of an anticommunist long since dead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real man 's family had been rounded up and liquidated to ensure absolute security . No one was left alive to dispute Scorpion 's authenticity . In the nearly forty years since , the agent Scorpion had risen steadily through the ranks of South Korea 's bureaucracy . And Kang had been his controller since the 1960s . " Scorpion goes well , Dear Leader . Our man has attained a high position in the fascist internal security force . " Kim interrupted him . " Excellent , Comrade Kang . Perfect in fact . Then he is ideally placed to carry out the task I have in mind . " SEPTEIVBER 6 ? THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS , SEOUL , SOUTH KOREA I he man known as Scorpion in North Korea stood by his office window . i rem there he could see faint , whitish-gray wisps of tear gas rising above the  | city skyline . Another student protest that had turned into a riot . Good . It would make things easier . But not any safer  --  not for him at least . He thought over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What possessed those fools ? Had they lost all ability to reason ? He 'd spent years worming his way into this position , and now they wanted to risk it all on a single throw of the dice . He turned away from the window . Should he refuse to carry out the order ? The thought tempted him , but he dismissed it . That would be viewed as disloyalty and Pyongyang had a long arm . Better to risk detection by his colleagues in the South Korean security service than to risk death at the hands of his comrades in the North 's Research Department . Besides , there was a certain charming subtlety to the mission he 'd been ordered to carry out . A careful word here . A thoughtful suggestion there . And all of them would be in character . He 'd established his credentials as a hardline anticommunist with years of dedicated service and fierce talk . No one would be surprised by investigation that would certainly ensue if he was successful . He stopped pacing by his desk . So be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four decades . Let them try again and he would outwit them yet again . The man called Scorpion picked up the phone . " Get me the minister . " He would light the fuse .  | General Jack McLaren leaned forward and rapped sharply on the divider . " Stop the car right here , Harmon . I want to see what the hell 's going on up ahead . " His driver grinned back over his shoulder . Anything you say , General . This is about the end of the line anyways . Looks like a doggone parking lot up there . " McLaren snorted and popped the car door open  --  and started to sweat as Seoul 's hot , sticky summer air rolled into the air-conditioned limo . It was worse out on the pavement . Heat waves shimmered and danced along the mass of stalled cars now backed up all along Sejong-Ro  --  Sejong Street  --  the wide , multilane boulevard cutting north to south through Seoul . McLaren shoved his heavy uniform cap squarely on his head and leaned hack in through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horn to their high-and-mightinesses and tell ' em I 'll be late . . . but do it diplomatically , of course . " His aide nodded and reached for the command phone on the seat beside him . McLaren turned away and began working his way up the street through the crowds . He frowned . Street vendors along the sidewalks were hastily packing away their goods , and department store clerks swarmed alongside them hurriedly unrolling steel mesh screens to cover display windows showing the latest Western fashions . Other drivers had gotten out of their cars and stood trying to see what had caused the tie-up . By the time he 'd gone just a couple of hundred yards , the reason for the traffic jam was obvious . Several hundred helmeted South Korean riot police had blocked off the whole multilane boulevard . Some were putting up crowd control barricades while others started waving cars off onto some of the  | smaller east-west roads feeding into Sejong-Ro . Bulky armored cars mounting water cannon and tear gas grenade launchers were parked behind the police line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred feet past the barricades . It 's like damned clockwork , he thought . It 's September in Seoul , so it must be time for another friggin ' student demonstration . Another few months of tear gas , rocks , and a bunch of puppydog kids yelling their heads off for " democracy " and " economic rights " ? things they had heard about but did n't really understand . There had been three already , all in the week since classes started . Each had been large and well organized , and each had been bigger than the one before . He squinted up into the dazzling noontime sky . Seoul 's skyscrapers cast giant , gloomy shadows across Sejong Street , but wherever they left an opening , the sun seemed murderously hot . Bad time for a demonstration ? " mob weather " they called it . The time when hot , muggy weather and harsh sunlight could drive people crazy , could make them snap without the slightest warning . McLaren kept walking toward the police line . An officer  --  a lieutenant by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salute . The officer , of course , knew him on sight . The lieutenant smiled . " Good morning , General McLaren . How can I be of service ? " His English was pretty good , almost accentless . " Well , for one thing , I 'd appreciate it if some of your men here could get my staff car out of that mess back there and through your barricades . I 've got a meeting with your President and Joint Chiefs up at the Blue House in just a few minutes . " The lieutenant snapped to attention . " At once , sir . " He turned and snapped a string of orders in Korean that sent two of his troopers jog-trotting down the street toward McLaren 's car . Then he turned back to McLaren . " We will have your vehicle through this obstruction shortly . And , if I might suggest , sir , it would be a good thing to leave this place as soon as possible . We are expecting a . . . how do you say . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up the street . " Yeah . I heard there was supposed to be a demonstration today , but my liaison officer told me it was expected further southeast , near the cathedral . " " It did start there , sir , but the rioters have broken past our barriers and they are marching in this direction . We are most concerned about this disturbance . Several Combat Police have already been injured . One group was isolated , surrounded , stripped of their equipment , and badly beaten . " McLaren frowned . And how many kids have you guys put in hospitals , today ? But it would n't be a good idea to ask that question aloud . Instead he just nodded . " Sounds bad , all right . " The South Korean officer kept smiling , but his smile seemed a little too  | fixed , and he kept swallowing . McLaren could n't figure out if the officer was more rattled by the presence of Commander Combined Forces  --  Korea so near ii demonstration , or by the demonstration itself . He eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a bunch of green kids . They all had their helmet visors up , but their uniforms were soaking up the heat . They had n't formed ranks yet . They were just standing around in small groups , talking , and although he could n't understand much Korean , their voices made one thing damned clear . These kids were as nervous as a preacher waiting in line at a cathouse . Then he saw the kicker . The thing he should have seen right away . Half these Combat Police conscripts were n't carrying their usual riot shields , nightsticks , and tear gas guns . They had very real M16s slung over their shoulders . And friggin ' bayonets , too . McLaren 's face tightened and he leaned forward to stare right into the police officer 's eyes . He kept his voice low and hard . " Jesus Christ , Lieutenant . Just what the hell is going on here ? " He stabbed a finger toward the fully armed troopers . " Riot troops with rifles ? What stupid bastard ordered that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet , the broadshouldered , barrel-chested American general towered over him . Ice-cold gray eyes glared down above a bent , often-broken nose and below the closecropped white bristles of a regulation military crew cut . The general 's face was the face of a man who 'd soldiered in half a dozen of the world 's most godforsaken climates  --  sun-browned , leathery , square-jawed , and lean . It was the face of a man born to command . Nervously , the lieutenant licked his lips . " I have my orders , sir . Radicals and communists are marching here from the Myongdong Cathedral . They have declared their intent to assault the Blue House and depose our president . " " Hell , " said McLaren , " they always say that . " " Sir , we can not take such threats lightly . The disturbances have grown more violent each day , and this one has been most difficult to control . These criminals may think they can actually reach the palace . But they will not get through this line . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volley over their heads to force them back  --  if the tear gas does n't work . " The lieutenant straightened up . " Those are my instructions , sir . And my men and I will carry them out . We can not allow these terrorists to cause trouble this close to the Blue House  --  or this close to your embassy for that mnatter . " In any event , General , this is an internal matter . And I am not under your command . " The Combat Police lieutenant seemed slightly more at ease now that he had remembered that . He saluted sharply and moved back to his men .  | McLaren stared after him  --  working hard not to explode in rage . The trouble was , the little son of a bitch was right . As the overall commander of all the regular military forces in South Korea , McLaren could control the movements of more than six hundred thousand South Korean and American troops . But he did n't have any authority over the country 's internal security and paramilitary units , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combat Police junior officer . There was n't any way around that  --  not in time for it to matter anyway . His long , black staff car , paced by two sweating policemen , pulled up beside him , and Corporal Harmon stuck his head out the window . " Hey , General , sir . We 're out and ready to roll . " McLaren climbed into the backseat and slammed the car door shut . " Did you get through to the Blue House , Doug ? " " They 've canceled today 's meeting , sir . Something about this upcoming demonstration requiring immediate attention . ' " His aide laughed . " Whatever that means . " McLaren jerked a thumb out the window as they passed through the rifle-armed Combat Police . " Well , I 'll tell you . It sure as hell does n't mean anything good . Let 's head up to the embassy to check in . " They sat back in silence as the car moved toward the gates of the American embassy compound . But as the Marine sentries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Hold it , Harmon . I 'm getting out here . " He turned to his aide . " Doug , you go on into the embassy and report in to HQ . Get a status report on the demonstration and try to find out if the CIA has any idea why the South Koreans are so goddamned spooked . Meantime , I 'm going to go back and eyeball this one  --  I do n't like the feeling I 'm getting about all of this . " McLaren noticed his aide and driver exchanging rueful looks as he got out of the car . Well , let them . He knew they did n't approve of his gallivanting off into a " situation , " but they 'd also learned the hard way not to try to stop him . He just did n't see the point in holing up with the ambassador while something explosive was happening just outside the embassy 's gates . It really was none of his business . After all , student protests often seemed like a national sport in South Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September until winter set in during November  --  and then it reopened in the spring until the summer monsoon closed it down in June . At times the protestors and the Combat Police  --  the ROK 's internal security force  --  acted as though they were simply carrying out some age-old ritual . But then somebody would get killed  --  hit in the head by a tear gas grenade , torched by a homemade , paint-spray flamethrower , or beaten to death in a wild street melee . When that happened , it was n't a game , and everybody damned well knew it .  | Combat police did not carry rifles . Whoever gave that order was scared of something . He wanted to find out what , before the kimchee really hit the fan . I le moved back down Sejong-Ro and stood on the sidewalk watching as the streets emptied of civilian traffic and filled up with truckload after truckload of green-jacketed riot police . It was very quiet now and growing hotter as the sun climbed directly overhead . Then he heard it . Softly at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythmic sound that seemed to echo off the tall buildings around him . Then he recognized it . It was the sound of thousands of voices chanting , yelling the same phrase over and over : " Tokchae Tado ! Tokchae hu.lo ! Down with the dictatorship ! Down with the dictatorship ! " The Combat Police at the barricades heard it too . McLaren saw their officers  --  including that s.o.b . lieutenant  --  cursing and kicking them into formed ranks . The engines of the armored cars behind them caught and roared into life . The turrets with the water cannon and tear gas launchers turned to point down the empty street . McLaren was tall enough to see over most of the riot police , and he could just begin to catch glimpses of the front rank of the crowd marching up the boulevard . He whistled softly to himself . There were a damned lot of them  --  thousands at least . And their shouts were even louder now that they 'd seen the police line . Most of them did n't look like the longhairs who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Nam . They wore clean clothes and neatly cropped hair . But they were also wearing handkerchiefs and surgical masks over their faces to block out tear gas . And there was something unnerving about their relentless approach . Despite the heat McLaren felt a chill run up his spine . This felt a lot like combat , but it was too mechanical , too predictable . It was like watching some kind of animated physics diagram  --  high-velocity mass meets immovable object . McLaren knew what bothered him most about it all . He was n't in charge and he could n't do a single thing to change the outcome . Suddenly he tensed . Someone was behind him . It was the same feeling he 'd had just before that damned Cong sniper put an AK round into his right leg back in Nam . Without turning around , McLaren stepped into the shelter of a store doorway and chanced a look back down the street . He started and had to stop himself from laughing out loud . It was n't a rifle scope that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV camera . But he ducked back into the doorway all the same as the CNN cameraman and his assistant jogged past toward the barricade line . It would n't do at all for the folks back home to see an American officer in full uniform standing around in the middle of a South Korean protest . That 'd be just the  | sort of thing that would give the nervous Nellies in the Pentagon PR office the fits . Twenty yards down the street the cameraman clambered onto the hood of a parked car to get a better shot of the demonstrators surging toward the police barricades . " Tokchae Tado ! Tokchae Tado ! Tokchae Tado ! " The chant was even louder now , and growing more guttural , more threatening . McLaren could n't hear the orders being yelled to the Combat Police , but suddenly the front two ranks brought their Plexiglas shields up and drew their nightsticks . The demonstrators closed to within fifty yards , then forty , thirty , twenty . Bricks and bottles started clattering off the riot troopers ' raised shields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? Now . A grenade launcher on one of the armored cars coughed . Others followed suit , and McLaren saw a white mist of tear gas billowing above the crowd , drifting downwind south along the street . He waited for the water cannon to open up . But the damned idiots had parked them too far back . The armored cars were rolling forward , but it was too late . The protestors were too close . They smashed into the front ranks of the riot police  --  shoving barricades aside , wrenching at plastic shields or kicking under them , and still screaming , " Tokchae Tado ! " The police fought back , clubbing students with their nightsticks and slamming shields into their faces . McLaren saw demonstrators going down with blood streaming from cut foreheads or broken noses . It was n't enough . The barricades were down , and the police line was beginning to give . There were Combat Police on the ground now , lying curled up as demonstrators kicked them savagely . Others were being pulled into the crowd or shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more and more of them fought their way forward through the press to get at the police . McLaren saw an officer stagger back , his face smashed by a thrown brick . The stupid bastard had n't had his visor down . McLaren stepped out of the doorway . It was just about time to go . When the police broke and ran , it was going to be every uniform for itself . But he stopped . The rear ranks of the Combat Police had unslung their rifles and were stepping forward  --  bringing them up and aiming over the crowd . And there was that damned lieutenant , getting ready to drop his hand to signal a volley like he was on some parade ground . Then it happened . McLaren could n't see what caused it  --  a thrown rock or bottle , an accidental elbow in the side , or just plain gutless stupidity  --  but somebody 's M16 went off on full automatic , spraying twenty steel-jacketed rounds moving at 3,250 feet per second into the struggling crowd of protestors and Combat Policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Bodies were  | thrown everywhere inside the deadly arc described by the assault rifle 's bullets . A spectacled student 's face exploded as a round caught him in the right eye . A Combat Policeman fell to his knees and then onto his face  --  a widening , red stain welling from the bullet holes in his back . A pretty girl stared in horror at the place where her hand had been . Others staggered hack or fell over to lie crumpled on the pavement . Then things snapped back into focus . The people in the front of the crowd were screaming and trying to run  --  trying to force their way away from the carnage around them . But the thousands of protestors pouring north along Sejong Street could n't see or hear what had happened ahead , and they kept pressing forward  --  shoving the screaming men and women in front ahead of them . Oh , shit , McLaren thought . That did it . The other young policemen had been staring in shock at the bloody tangle of bodies at their feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they panicked . First one , and then the rest , started firing into the crowd at point-blank range . Dozens of protestors were cut down in a matter of seconds  --  smashed to the pavement in a hail of automatic weapons fire . As they fell in writhing , blood-soaked heaps , the crowd finally began breaking , with hundreds , then thousands , of people screaming , turning , and trying to run . But the Combat Police were now completely out of control . They began moving forward , still firing . And McLaren could see some of them fumbling for new magazines . Goddamnit , some of those bastards were even reloading ! Without thinking about it he left the doorway and started to run toward them . Maybe he could kick some sense into those frigging morons . But it was probably too late for that . They were already chasing after the screaming crowds scattering back down Sejong Street . Some were still shooting , firing from the hip as they ran . Others contented themselves with clubbing any student within reach . McLaren saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst into a small group of pleading men and women cowering in front of a department store display window . They were thrown back in among the bullet-riddled mannequins . He kept running down the street , but a muffled cry following a sharp groan brought him skidding to a stop . He turned . There , not ten feet away , was a crazy-eyed Combat Policeman trying to tear the TV camera out of the hands of the CNN cameraman he 'd seen earlier . The soundman sat slumped against a car door , hands pressed to his face with blood running out between them . That , by God , was too damned much . McLaren did n't much care for most reporters , but these guys were Americans , after all . He charged in , pulled the riot trooper around by his combat webbing , and sent a right cross smashing into the man 's face . The Korean staggered back , and McLaren  | followed up with a left into his stomach . The trooper grunted and fell over gasping for air . McLaren felt himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fifties . He turned to the cameraman kneeling by his partner . " Can he walk ? " The reporter nodded . " Yeah . I think so . But we 're gon na have to help him along . " He slung his equipment across his back . Then , for the first time , he took a close look at McLaren . " Jesus , man . I do n't think I 've ever been rescued by a real , live U.S. cavalryman before . " He stuck a hand out . " Thanks . Thanks a lot . " McLaren shook hands . " No problem . " He bent down to take one of the dazed soundman 's arms . " Right now , though , I think it 's time to get the hell out of Dodge . " With the wounded man stumbling between them , they lurched up the street toward the American embassy . Behind them , McLaren could hear the rattle of automatic weapons still echoing throughout Seoul 's city center . It sounded like all hell was breaking loose back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if it did , he and his troops were going to get caught right in the middle .  | The televisions are always on in a Congressional office . " Good morning . I 'm Amanda Hayes and this is a CNN special report  --  The Massacre in Seoul . " Jeremy Mitchell looked up into the TV screen perched precariously on his bookcase . One hand reached for his tortoise-shell glasses while the other shoved the latest draft press release on National Frozen Food Week off his notepad . Without taking his eyes off the small screen , he waved the nearest intern over , a short , pudgy University of Michigan junior who was spending his fall semester learning the business of government while duplicating constituent mail for a congressman . Mitchell ignored the discontented frown on the kid 's face . Endless hours of gofer work  --  stapling , filing , duplicating ? those were the dues you paid to get more meaningful work later on . Mitchell had paid his own dues in full . Summers as an unpaid campaign volunteer . University terms spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after school as a poorly paid legislative correspondent , locked away for sixty-hour weeks drafting and redrafting answers to letters written by constituents . By then he 'd seen how the system worked . You climbed over the still-warm bodies of those who 'd thought they were your friends and coworkers . He 'd used that knowledge to win a succession of promotions  --  first to handling domestic issues as a legislative assistant and later to committee staffer . A lot of people who 'd trusted Jeremy Mitchell 's sincere smiles , open-featured good looks , twinkling blue eyes , and firm handshake had long since come to regret trusting first impressions . Now , ten years and a pile of broken friendships later , he held the top-dog slot in any congressional office : he was the administrative assistant  --  the AA . And that meant he ran everything and everyone in the office , including the representative , if the man or woman was malleable enough .  | Mitchell smiled thinly to himself . Ben Barnes was so malleable that he often reminded people of the Playdough little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at the intern impatiently waiting . " Phil , go get the congressman . He 's going to want to see this . " The intern nodded grumpily and went , threading his way through the crowded maze of desks , cubicles , bookcases , filing cabinets , and stacks of newly printed newsletters that marked any House-side congressional office . Senators and their staffs usually had more room , but House members and their people worked under conditions that would have made a sweatshop seem spacious . A single suite of two rooms usually held twelve to fifteen harried staffers , their phones , files , and personal computers . Congressman Ben Barnes appeared out of his inner office moments later , looking rumpled with wisps of his thinning , ash-blond hair sticking up at all angles . A wrinkled red silk tie hung loosely from his open shirt collar , and his eyes were puffy and bloodshot . Mitchell took it all in and made a mental note to never again let the congressman attend an auto industry luncheon unaccompanied . Thank God there had n't been any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open bar unless there was somebody around to pull him away . The congressman smiled uncertainly and blearily at his AA . " What 's up , Jer ? " Mitchell pointed at the screen . " . . . as this tape from a CNN camera team shows , armed troops began firing on the students  --  apparently without warning . " Reports are sketchy and the South Korean government has imposed a news blackout , but it appears that at least several hundred people have been killed . Sources in one Seoul hospital report treating dozens of gunshot wounds and emergency rooms all across the city are said to be overflowing with the critically injured . There are even unconfirmed reports that several American or European tourists have been killed . " For now , Seoul remains under strict curfew . And South Korea 's security forces have warned that violators will be shot on sight . That 's a threat they seem all too willing to enforce . This is Amanda Hayes . We 'll have more news from Seoul on the half-hour . " Mitchell reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad for hay fever medicine . He spun around in his chair to face the congressman . Barnes seemed puzzled . " Very interesting , Jer . But could n't you have just put together a memo for me ? I 've got a million things to do before the committee meets this afternoon . " " But do n't you see . . . " Mitchell stopped . Yelling at your boss was not recommended for Capitol Hill survival . He tried again . " Ben , this is the kind of break we 've been waiting for . This Seoul massacre thing gives us the leverage we need to put an imports bill on the legislative fast track . "  | " That 's great . That 's really wonderful . " Barnes still looked a little lost  --  an expression he was careful never to wear in front of TV cameras or constituent groups . Mitchell decided to lay it all out . " South Korea makes those cheap Hyundai cars and other products that have the unions back home all hot and bothered . They want some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we have n't been able to move anything worthwhile through both the House and Senate . " Barnes seemed to be following along , so he threw in the clincher . " Right now these news reports are being shown all across the country  --  in every district  --  so I do n't think South Korea 's going to have too much public support by nightfall . They 've been getting bad press for some time now , and this should really fan the flames . If we got a tough trade bill moving , we just might be able to ram it through before all the free traders ' know what 's hit them . And that would make the autoworkers back home very happy . " " And I 'm going to need the autoworkers next year when I run for the Senate . " Barnes finished the sentence for him . He grinned . " That 's great thinking , Jer . Let 's do it . Draft up a real solid bill for me , something that 'll pull in a big coalition and get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it later this afternoon . Okay ? " Mitchell nodded and Barnes left humming happily . Mitchell spun back around to his keyboard and opened a new file , Korea-Bash . He smiled to himself . That was going to be a pretty accurate title . Now , he thought , let 's see just what kind of a packaging deal I can come up with . Packaging was everything on the Hill , and if you wanted to pass a bill , you had to be sure it had a little something in it for every important interest group . That was part of the fun . Mitchell started making a list . The first section had to be a strong condemnation of South Korea 's human rights abuses and a tough set of required democratic reforms , with a short-term time limit for their implementation . Church groups and the other liberal lobbying organizations would really lap that stuff up . Then came the sanctions the U.S. would impose if the Koreans did n't put the reforms in place before the deadline . The most obvious were new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give the union bosses their bone , and they , in turn , would give a lot for Barnes come the next election . Mitchell paused , his hands held over the keyboard while he thought . Yeah , the U.S. had troops in South Korea . Well , we would n't want to prop up a corrupt , tyrannical regime , would we ? He typed in " Withdrawal all U.S. forces if reforms not made . " That would piss off the conservatives , but it would win solid backing from the liberals in the party caucus . Maybe they could make sure that any troops pulled out of South Korea were sent to bases  | in Texas . That would make the Speaker happy . And making the Speaker happy was a crucial part of getting any bill through the House of Representatives . Now he needed something to help break up the conservative opposition . " Cut off all military aid to South Korea and use the money to reduce the deficit . " Mitchell smiled . That would pick up a few votes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fig leaf to hide behind if they voted for the bill . That should do it . Mitchell knew that the committee 's legislative counsel cold turn his rough notes into a polished piece of legal language in a matter of hours . He could concentrate on putting together all the background material they 'd need ? " Dear Colleague " letters soliciting support from other congressmen , fact sheets , and most importantly , press releases . Given two or three days and some good staff support , and he could flood the Hill and the airwaves with talk about Representative Barnes 's new South Korean sanctions bill . Then he frowned at the outline taking shape on his screen . Any bill drawn up along those lines should be a real vote-getter . The trouble was it touched on everything from trade and taxes to defense and foreign affairs . And that opened the door for practically every major committee in both the House and Senate to demand a piece of the action . Mitchell was n't sure who had first called committees " God 's gift to procrastination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a completely accurate picture at times . With only a few weeks left until the Congress was scheduled to adjourn , there just was n't time to waste while every committee held hearings , tossed in its own favorite amendments , and issued its own thousand-page report . He was going to have to get Barnes to cut enough deals with the other committee chairmen to win expedited consideration for the bill . Even worse , he was going to need a senator to do the same thing over on the other side of the Hill . Okay , it was n't going to be easy  --  but it could be done . And if he could pull this off , his reputation as a top-notch legislative strategist would be made forever . That was something worth working for . He just hoped that the South Koreans did n't get smart and stop killing each other before they could get the bill through . Mitchell turned away from his computer screen and started flipping through his Rolodex . It was time to start calling in a few favors . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal political action groups and for the unions . Now he was going to cash in . Besides , they 'd all probably jump at the chance . He pulled a card out of his Rolodex and started dialing . It had begun .  | The reporter stood framed against the Capitol dome . " This is Phil Smith , reporting from Capitol Hill . Just three days after the Seoul massacre , Congress has begun moving against the South , Korean government . " In a press conference held this afternoon , Representative Ben Barnes of Michigan , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Trade , and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James Farell of New York , announced the introduction of a stiff sanctions bill aimed at South Korea . More than one hundred congressmen and thirty senators have already announced their support for the measure . " The bill calls on the South Korean government to institute major political reforms . Among other things , it demands an end to press censorship , freedom for all political prisoners , and the immediate reform of the entire South Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all trade barriers aimed at U.S. exports to Korea , and a significant reduction in Korea 's trade surplus with the United States . " If these conditions are n't met within ninety days after the bill is signed into law by the President , the measure would automatically impose tariffs on almost all South Korean products coming into this country , end Korea 's most-favored-nation trade status , and cut U.S. military assistance . And in a move guaranteed to outrage congressional conservatives , it would also require the complete withdrawal of all U.S. forces now stationed in South Korea . " The picture cut to footage of Ben Barnes speaking earnestly into the camera . " We have no quarrel with the people of South Korea . Nor do we seek trade protectionism for its own sake . But we also know that America can not be seen to side with oppression , tyranny , and ruthless terror . The South Korean government must learn that its brutality will not go unpunished . America will not condone cold-blooded murder . And the Congress can not stand idly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The videotape of Barnes ended , cutting back to the CBS Evening News anchorman in New York . " In other congressional news today , the House Foreign Affairs Committee continued its work on legislation aimed at improved Soviet-American relations by defeating an amendment that would have linked U.S.-Soviet ties with Soviet actions in Afghanistan . " SEPTEMBER 12 ? THE OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING , WASHINGTON , D.C. Blake Fowler finished reading the telex from Seoul before tossing it onto the pile of papers on his desk . He leaned back , took his wire-frame glasses off ,  | and rubbed his eyes . God , he was getting too old to stay up reading fine print all night . What you could do at twenty in college did n't seem at all possible at thirty-five . Fowler let his head drop onto his chest and closed his eyes . Maybe he could get away with a short in-office nap . People had to make allowances for you when you 'd been up for almost twenty-four hours straight , did n't they ? He already knew the answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be awake and alert for days on end , to brief politicians in a split second , to keep rival intelligence agencies from going to war against each other  --  and to leap tall buildings in a single bound for that matter . Just the kind of thing that getting a Ph.D . in Asian and Pacific Affairs prepared you for . Fowler squirmed , trying to get more comfortable . His damned desk chair must have been designed especially by the Spanish Inquisition . " Good morning , Sleeping Beauty . Can I wake you with a kiss ? " Fowler warily opened an eye to find his secretary hovering over him with a cup of coffee . She looked as tired as he felt . That was n't really surprising  --  she 'd been working all night , too . He sat upright . " Sure , Princess Charming . You can kiss me . But then you have to save me from my wife . " Katie Morgan smiled . " No thanks , Beaut . I 'd really rather go hunt a dragon for you . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk , carefully avoiding the stack of documents still waiting to be read , and dropped an interoffice memo on top . " And speaking of reptiles , Putnam wants to see you in his chambers at oh nine fifteen sharp . " She looked at her watch . " Which is in ten minutes . He wants to know what happened to the world while he slept , or attended the congressional prayer breakfast , or something . " " Ah , sh . . . darn , I mean . " Fowler started leafing through the papers on his desk . " Katie , I 'm going to need the latest Agency analysis and those NSA intercepts . Putnam probably wo n't understand them , but they look impressive . " He stood up , stretching and yawning . This was a hell of a way to start the new day . Walking outside over to the White House made him feel a lot better . He could have taken the tunnel over , but the crisp , cool morning air woke him up more than coffee ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . It was getting long , he thought , and he 'd have to try to find time to get it cut . As Fowler strolled across Executive Drive , the early-morning sunlight threw his image against the windshield of a parked Volvo . He turned his head slightly while passing to study himself . And grinned when he became aware of the unconscious habit . Although he never changed much between glimpses , he could never quite break himself of the mannerism.  | At only a tad over six feet , Fowler was n't any taller than the average man his age , it was just that he was slender enough to make himself seem taller . His wife , Mandy , called him lean and rangy , but she was prejudiced . The tight fit of the khaki slacks around his waist made him realize that some of that youthful slenderness was starting to disappear  --  the victim of too much desk work , too many wolfed-down junk-food meals , and an aversion to most forms of exercise . For the thousandth time , he made a mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousandth time he dismissed it from his mind . At least his face did n't show any immediate signs of falling apart on him . But not even Mandy would call it handsome . Instead , a long , thin nose , large green eyes , and mobile , arching eyebrows gave him a faintly professorial look  --  the quizzical , distracted air of someone always looking for more than the obvious . He reached the White House , flashed his security badge to the Marine guard and Secret Serviceman on duty at the side door , and went in . As the national security adviser , Putnam had an office just down the hall from the Oval Office itself  --  a fact that he was always careful to mention at cocktail parties . And Fowler noticed that he 'd managed to get an even larger nameplate , GEORGE PUTNAM-NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER , plastered all over his door . Putnam 's secretary looked up as he walked in . She smiled sympathetically . " Long night ? " He nodded , rubbing his chin and realizing he 'd forgotten to shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked that you take a seat for a few minutes . He 's on a very important call with one of his old Hill cronies . " Fowler looked at his watch : 9:15 A. M. on the dot . That bastard Putnam . He seemed to think that you showed people how important and busy you were by keeping them waiting outside your office door . Fowler thought that George Putnam , erstwhile national security adviser and full-time asshole , was a good example of the truism that when the pendulum swung , it usually swung too far . Several of Putnam 's predecessors had been highly professional career soldiers who 'd somehow managed to get both themselves and the president they served in hot water . There 'd been an outcry in the press and on Capitol Hill , and a whole slew of foreign policy pundits had come forward arguing that the next president should find someone who could work more easily within the constraints imposed by Congress and by domestic politics . Well , that was advice the new president had taken  --  and Fowler thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of a staff bigwig on the Hill before the election , and then he 'd wormed his way into a transition ream slot with the incoming administration . After that , he 'd  | managed to surprise everyone outside the Hill establishment by parlaying his temporary position into a nomination for the national security adviser 's job . Fowler had to admit that Putnam knew how to operate . That did n't make him any less of a jerk , but it did make him the jerk responsible for keeping the President up-to-date on national security issues . Putnam kept him on ice for nearly fifteen minutes this time . And when Fowler walked in , he did n't even look up from the notes he was scribbling . Instead he waved vaguely toward a chair . " I 'll be right with you , Blake . No rest for the righteous , eh ? " Fowler sat , trying manfully to conceal his disdain for his nominal superior . Putnam was still a young man , barely into his forties , but he looked older somehow . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser 's fleshy , freckled face and petulant , thin-lipped mouth made him look like an aging schoolboy , like the bully who 'd never been beaten up . After a moment Putnam laid his pen down carefully , flexed his fingers , and sat hack looking smug . He brushed a wisp of graying , reddish-brown , curly hair back into place . " Always pays to keep your ear to the ground , Blake . Got some really hot stuff from the Hill this morning . " Fowler knew that Putnam 's " really hot stuff " was probably the latest dirt on some senator 's love life , so he kept quiet . Putnam looked a little exasperated that his subordinate had n't begged him to share the latest gossip . " Ah , well . Ca n't expect you professionals ' to care much about the way things really get done in this town , now can I ? " Putnam shook his head . " Someday , Blake , you 'll realize that this town does n't move on facts  --  it moves on perceptions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across his desk . " And the granddaddy rumor mill of them all is right over there . " He pointed off in the rough direction of the Hill . " That 's where the action 's at . " Without the Congress , the President 's agenda is dead in the water . So we 've got to keep on our toes . We 've got to know who 's up and who 's down  --  who the Speaker or majority leader like and who they do n't . And we have to keep them happy . This administration has to have a sort of symbiotic relationship with the Congress . You know , you scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . ' Do you see what I mean ? " Fowler could name quite a few presidents who 'd been at their best when they opposed congressional idiocy , but it seemed a little too early in the morning for another pointless political debate . Instead he reached into his folder and pulled out a sheaf of papers . " Well , George , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I have a tough enough time keeping up with South Korean politics these days . " Putnam frowned . " Oh , yes . South Korea . That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . " He tapped a finger on his bare desk blotter . " Now look , Blake ,  | we 've got some real trouble brewing on the Hill over Korea . And the President needs to know just what the hell is going on over there . " Fowler handed him the latest CIA analysis , a stapled selection of National Security Agency signals intercepts , and a telexed report from the general commanding U.S. forces in Korea . " Jesus Christ , Blake , I do n't have time to read all this crap ! That 's what I 've got you for . Did you bother to put together a one-pager for my signature  --  or was that too much trouble for you ? " Control . Control , Fowler told himself . Do n't let him see that he 's managed to piss you off . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning . But Putnam waved it away . " Just give me the gist for now . I 'll read it for details later . " Fowler tried hard to keep his voice level . " Essentially , our most recent reports show some improvement in the situation . Seoul and the other major cities are still under a nighttime curfew , but there are signs that the government will lift it sometime in the next three days . There have been some minor incidents outside Seoul  --  small demonstrations , a few rocks thrown at police , that kind of stuff  --  but nothing really dangerous . The National University is still crawling with security troops , of course , but there has n't been any further trouble . The students still seem to be in shock . " And so far the North Koreans have n't tried anything funny . We 've gotten the usual propaganda blasts , but we have n't yet picked up evidence of anything worse in the works . " Putnam interrupted . " What about the massacre ? Do we have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing we 're going to get asked by the press . " " Well , the government over there is probably going to lay the blame on some junior police officer  --  undoubtedly one of the ones who got himself killed . But that general of ours who saw the start of the whole thing argues the real culprit is whoever ordered the police to meet that demonstration with real guns in their hands . " Fowler shook his head . And that had to have been someone pretty high up  --  probably at the cabinet level . " Putnam snorted , " Stupid bastards . " For once Fowler was inclined to agree with his boss . " Yeah . We 're still not sure just why whoever it was thought it was necessary . But we do know that the government 's been under a lot of pressure from the heads of some of the South Korean industrial conglomerates , the chaebol , to keep things under tighter control this fall . The last round of unrest wound up costing them a lot in labor concessions , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sell enough autos and computer parts last year to cut their international debt as much as they wanted to . But I do n't think a full-fledged massacre is what they had in  | mind . " Fowler slid the heavily underlined summary on top of the rest of the documents he suspected Putnam would never read . Putnam looked across the desk at him . " So what 's the bottom line ? Can the President tell the press and the Hill this was just a one-time screwup that wo n't happen again ? Or can we expect more of this ? " Fowler shrugged . " There 's really no way to tell . After the 1980 bloodbath in Kwangju , things were quiet for six or seven years . But this happened right on worldwide TV and it happened in Seoul . And Seoul is the heart of South Korea  --  it 's the capital , the population center , business center , cultural center , you name it . We just do n't have enough information yet to make an accurate prediction . " " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the Man more than that . He ca n't just go out there in front of the cameras and say , Gosh , fellas , there 's really no way to tell if Korea 's gon na come unwrapped faster than you can say Iran . ' " Putnam 's attempt to imitate the President 's voice fell flat , but the anger in it was real enough . " And it 's not just the press , " Putnam continued . " We 've got to deal with the House and Senate as well . You know about this Barnes sanctions bill that got dropped in the hopper yesterday ? " Fowler nodded . " I read the summary Legislative Affairs put out last night . Frankly , I ca n't think of when I last saw such a piece of dangerous stupidity ? " Putnam cut him off . " I do n't give a great big goddamn for your uninformed opinions on legislation , Blake . " He made a visible effort to control himself . " The point is , the bill 's not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position on it . And for once I want a single administration position . " Putnam looked over at his desk clock . " So what I want you to do , Dr. Fowler , is put together a top-notch , interagency working group to analyze the potential effects of the Barnes bill . Get all the key players involved ? State , Defense , Commerce , CIA , and all the rest . Do it ASAP and make sure that all the documents flow through me , okay ? I want a final report on my desk inside of two weeks from now . " Fowler mentally wrote off two weeks ' worth of dinners at home with his family , his daughter 's school play , and a lot of domestic tranquility . " You know that either State or Defense will fight like hell to chair this thing . And they 'll want to route through their respective bosses first . " Putnam smirked . " I know . So what you do is this . Put me on the group as chairman , and then I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Fowler nodded his understanding . Putnam might be a slimy son of a bitch and he might not know squat about foreign affairs , but he did know how to play the bureaucracy game . The Korean situation involved everything from foreign policy and military strategy to questions of international trade and  | domestic politics . And all of that made the President 's national security adviser the logical choice to head up an interagency group on South Korea . That gave Putnam power , because only the designated chairman of an interagency group had the right to present the group 's final report to the President . " Okay , Blake , I 'm sure you 've got work to do , so I wo n't keep you any longer . " Putnam 's eyes flicked over to the clock again . " Besides , I 've got an important meeting right now . " Fowler stood , took his folder off Putnam 's desk , and walked to the door . He opened it , but Putnam 's voice stopped him with his hand still on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come in looking like a refugee all the time . I expect my senior staff to set the right tone for this shop , all right ? " Fowler did n't say anything . He just fought down the urge to go back and kick his boss in the nuts and went out  --  brushing past the man waiting in Putnam 's outer office . Behind him , he heard Putnam trying out his best " one of the guys " tone of voice : " Hey , Jet ! Good to see you ! Come right on in.  | The " Internationale " sounded odd to Colonel Sergei Ivanovitch Borodin . Its harsh , blaring refrain rebounded off the concrete-reinforced granite walls of the hangar  --  echoes chasing one another with nowhere to go . After a while Borodin swore he could have closed his eyes and heard the same series of notes three times over . It was distracting , and he did n't need the distraction . There were too many things he needed to watch carefully , too many things to remember . This mission was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment . Of itself that held no great concern for Borodin . He 'd served the State in a similar capacity across half the globe . But this place was so  --  he ' searched for the right word  --  so confined , so suffocating . Nothing at all like the vast , open deserts beyond Tripoli or the rolling grasslands around Harare . This feeling of walking a tightrope over a deep pit had first come over him as he 'd waited to fly out of Moscow 's Domodedovo Airport . " Be careful , Sergei . Be watchful . " General Petrov , deputy commander in chief for air combat training , had whispered in his ear as they stood together looking out the departure lounge window into the late-night darkness . The old man had chuckled at Borodin 's alarmed expression , but his words had been blunt  --  a rare thing for the short , stout , white-haired friend of his father . " These North Koreans are slant-eyes , yes , Sergei . But they are clever slant-eyes . They 've played us off against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're pulling them into our nets . " But " ? the old man had waggled a finger in his face ? " only just . They could easily slip outside . We ca n't afford that , Sergei Ivanovitch . You understand ? So you must not  | offend them . You must not disparage this personality cult nonsense  --  this godhead  --  they 've built up around the old man Kim and his son . " Petrov had dropped his voice and laid an arm around Borodin 's shoulders . " So , a word to the wise , eh ? Walk softly in North Korea , there are powerful eyes watching . Politburo eyes , Sergei . You do n't want to count trees or dig for gold , you understand ? Walk soft . " Borodin shivered slightly as he remembered those last words . This might well be the season of glasnost , but the icy forests of Siberia and the man-killing mines of the Kolyma were still there  --  they 'd just been pushed into the shadows a bit . His memory moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union , then lower above the rugged peaks of the Taeback Mountains , and finally south across the narrow plains toward Pyongyang . Into this cavernous hangar carved out of a mountainside east of the capital . The " Dear Leader , " Kim Jong-Il , son of North Korea 's absolute ruler , had met the plane personally . No surprises there . Neither Borodin nor his political officer , Major Yepishev , had expected the Great Leader himself , Kim Il-Sung , to make an appearance . According to both the GRU and the KGB , the old man 's health was increasingly fragile , and they 'd arrived on a hard , gray day , heavy with cold rain driven by the wind . There was n't much trace of the rotten weather in here , though , Borodin thought , surveying the high-vaulted hangar that held not only his Ilyushin airliner , an I1-18 , but also several other , smaller transports , a reviewing stand , and a uniformed crowd of North Korean dignitaries . The size of the place made a mockery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred meters from tunnels cut deeper into the rock out to a set of thickly armored main hangar doors . Lighting , ventilation , and tire suppression systems turned the ceiling into a nightmarish tangle of shafts , cabling , and piping . The Soviet colonel could n't even begin to imagine the amount of labor it had taken to carve all of this out of solid rock . It surpassed even the massive engineering works carried out by his own country 's Civil Defense Force . He cast a sidelong glance at the row of impassive Korean faces on either side of him . What was going on inside those heads ? The silence alerted him . The band had stopped playing , and now Kim Jong-Il stood ready to speak at the podium . Borodin found the man 's appearance unsettling . On the surface the " Dear Leader " seemed soft , pudgy  --  a stark contrast to the colonel , who 'd always prided himself on his trim , flat stomach and narrow , high-cheeked features . But the eyes , the eyes were dangerous  --  cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suited a man who now controlled his nation 's entire internal security and military apparatus . Kim 's voice was soft , commanding attention by necessity more than by  | bluster . " Socialist brothers , we welcome your presence here . We hope that your gracious visit will permit a useful exchange of information between our two great peoples .. . " " Exchange . " Now there was an amusing word , Borodin thought . He and his men  --  some of the Soviet Union 's top pilots and aircraft mechanics ? were a training team . Their very presence here chipped away at Kim II-Sting 's so-called self-reliance doctrine . It was all a nice little ballet . His team had to maintain the fiction that they were here to examine North Korean air tactics , and not just to show the Koreans how to fly the shiny new toys they 'd been shipped from the Soviet Union . North Korean air tactics , what nonsense . These people thought the MiG-21 was a first-line aircraft . At the same time , his briefings at the Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union needed Kim Il-Sung 's friendship and cooperation . The colonel knew that Kim 's dynastic communism was anathema to his superiors , but the North Koreans were at least nominal socialists , and they were opposed to the West . More importantly , the country occupied a crucial geostrategic position  --  it was the fulcrum het ween the Soviet Union , China , and Japan . The " fulcrum . " The word described the Kremlin 's view of North Korea with precision . The Politburo saw it as the vital agent through which force could he exerted against either the Chinese or the Japanese . Borodin smiled inwardly despite his concerns . Considering his mission here , that was even a clever word play , one worthy of Crokodil , the humor magazine . And if his country did n't help Kim , the Chinese would be only too happy to oblige . That was something his country could not risk . Borodin knew that firsthand . He had been stationed in the Far East early in his career . You could n't fly out of Vladivostok and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , antique relics for the most part . Their tanks and artillery were laughable by modern standards . And their men were underequipped . But there were so many of them and they were close to the Trans-Siberian Railway , the lifeline between European Russia and its Far Eastern possessions . Everyone knew that the Chinese were just waiting for the right moment to stab the motherland in the back . Had n't those yellow-skinned , " pseudocommunists " spent years sucking up to the West , begging for technology and trade ? Did n't they insist on setting an independent , often anti-Soviet , foreign policy ? Yes , Borodin thought , the Politburo was wise to worry about North Korea 's leanings . The State did n't need any more enemies in this part of the world  --  it needed friends and allies . Puppets . It was vital to give North Korea 's Great Leader as much help as he deserved , at the highest price he  | was willing to pay . The Koreans had already agreed to allow overflights by Soviet aircraft . Next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basing agreement . The new aircraft he and his team would teach the North Koreans to fly were the first token of Soviet reciprocity . Others would soon follow . His mission was to smooth the way for the diplomats and their treaties by showing these Asiatics just how valuable Soviet assistance could be . He focused his attention back on Kim Jong-Il , the Dear Leader , still mouthing sanctimonious phrases about their " historic friendship " and the " common struggle against imperialism . " By all accounts the younger Kim should prove an ally was well documented , and it was a thirst the Chinese could do little to satisfy . Borodin came back to full consciousness of his surroundings as he realized that Kim 's speech was finishing , winding up with what must be a standard invocation . " And so we are confident that the colonel and his men will gain a greater understanding of the international socialist struggle and the dynamic contribution made to it by the Korean people under the guidance of our Great Leader . " Kim stepped back from the podium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted men drawn up in the open area of the hangar . Borodin clapped along with them , meeting Kim 's eyes steadily and with a diplomatic smile stuck on his face . The North Korean dipped his head slightly toward the podium . That was Borodin 's cue . As briefed , he bowed to Kim and the other dignitaries and felt carefully for the prepared speech scripted by the Foreign Ministry . " The people of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics send their greetings . . . " Borodin read the hackneyed phrases aloud almost without thinking about them . He had read the same kind of stilted nonsense a dozen times before in a dozen different countries . These ceremonies were unimportant . The real work would come later , behind closed doors and in the cockpits of jet fighter aircraft . He was growing impatient to get on with it . The sooner they began , the sooner he and his men could get out of this bleak , Asiatic fortress-state . GRU SECURE SECTION , SOVIET EMBASSY , PYONGYANG ... The sophistication and extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of training ... " Borodin laid down his pen and rubbed his eyes . The harsh , bright fluorescent lights of the GRU office were painful this late at night . He  | I N k i rip twin the paper , trying to get his eyes to focus on something tat tirer tIlan a few centimeters away . Not that there was much to see . A few old , battered wooden desks , paint scraps peeling off the walls , two clocks , one on Moscow time , the other set for Pyongyang , some filing cabinets , and the obligatory portrait of the General Secretary . Functional , but not esthetic . Borodin savored that last word . That was the kind of word only those who were really kulturny , cultured , could remember when they were on their last legs . Little Mother , but he was tired . It was absurd to fly across eight time zones , spend a full day , and then spend the night hours trying to write a coherent arrival report . But his instructions from Moscow were clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , encoded , and transmitted by the mission commander , by him , each and every day . North Korea was clearly now a high priority for the staff bigwigs at Defense Ministry HQ . He looked at what he had just written and nodded to himself . Certainly that was accurate enough . The North Korean air installations and crews were impressive . More than impressive in fact . After the speech-making mercifully ended , the younger Kim had taken him in tow for a thorough tour of the Pyongyang-East Airbase . Borodin shook his head at the memory of it all . The vast transport plane hangar had just been the start . Behind it and above it lay a whole connected series of tunnels , barracks , offices , quarters , control centers , maintenance shops , and fuel storage tanks . The base radar installations were constructed in elevator shafts so that they could " pop up " and " pop down " for protection against enemy air attack . SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile batteries and radar-controlled , antiaircraft gun positions dotted the mountain slopes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installations into piles of flaming wreckage . Even the logistics facilities and train yards were hardened to prevent resupply trains from being caught at their most vulnerable point . Naturally the North Koreans had saved the best for last . A hangar even larger than the first , crammed with sleek , delta-winged interceptors , Jian-7s  --  Chinese-model MiG-21F derivatives . They 'd allowed him to move freely throughout the hangar , inspecting everything at close range . For Borodin it had been like diving nearly thirty years back into his own past . The MiG-21 had been the first real combat aircraft he 'd ever flown . So many years ago . He and his wife , Tania , had still been a happy couple then . Borodin shook his head . Those were unprofitable memories . It was more important to concentrate on the task he faced here and now . The colonel narrowed his eyes , trying to recall as much as possible of Kim 's last little speech , delivered near the wingtip of one of the camouflaged  | fighters . What had the man said ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mperialist attack and deliver a crushing blow in return . There are bases like this all over the People 's Republic , and they make the aggressor 's task someimpossible . " Borodin tapped his pen thoughtfully against his chin . There had been something else . Something that had struck him as even more bombastic , more dangerous somehow . Ah , yes . " Four more bases like this one were recently completed near the present Demilitarized Zone . From them we will be able to launch our final drive for the liberation of the South . Our troops are well trained and can use our equipment at its maximum effectiveness . " Borodin had n't liked the sound of that . " Final drive for the liberation of the South . " From anyone else he would have dismissed it as the standard propaganda line . But there had been a tone of inevitability or certainty in Kiln 's voice that sent chills up his spine . Should he highlight that statement and his impression of it for Moscow 's attention ? No , perhaps not . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're dreaming . Putting strange interpretations on things you heard hours ago . Stick to what you know  --  air combat  --  and let the diplomats worry about the other things going on around this place . He leaned closer to the paper , shutting away the uncertainties by remembering the show they 'd put on for him . Kim had no sooner finished speaking when he 'd turned and nodded to a nearby North Korean Air Force colonel , who 'd simply raised his hand overhead and shown a clenched fist . A klaxon had blared from the hangar roof high overhead and Borodin had umped . He 'd had to stifle the urge to run for an aircraft  --  the old reflexes were still there from his days in the air defense forces , Voyska PVO . Instead he 'd turned to watch men pour from doors in the walls . He 'd picked one man in a flight suit out of the mass and tracked him as he ran over to a MiG  --  no a J ian-7 , he corrected himself , not quite the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder like a gazelle as ground crew circled the aircraft , moving equipment and performing lastminute checks . Then a howling roar as the first jet engine fired up . The noise had bounced off the walls and hurt Borodin 's ears . He 'd felt air moving and looked up to see huge ventilation fans pumping fresh air into the hangar . More noise . The pilot he 'd been concentrating on had just started his engine . Most of the exhaust seemed to be directed into a vent or pipe directly behind the aircraft . More tunnels in the rock , Borodin thought . Mother of God , these people were like moles . As the first interceptor rolled off its chocks toward the main hangar doors , a North Korean Air Force colonel had pointed wordlessly to a huge clock directly over them . Obviously started the moment the alert began , it had shown just a little more than two and a half minutes elapsed time . Even  | considering the simpler systems and controls on the MiG-21/Jian-7 , that was still a good time , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had still been closed . For a moment Borodin had half-wondered if they planned to show him an interceptor smashing head-on into reinforced steel . But then , as the Jian-7 's nose wheel crossed a yellow line painted on the floor , he 'd heard a loud , ringing alarm above the howling jet engines and watched in amazement as the hangar doors snapped open , tons of metal moving in seconds . The jet had shot through , followed by another and another , until the entire battalion of aircraft had been scrambled . The entire exercise had taken nine minutes and fifteen seconds . Borodin thought that was a damned good time . Even assuming that he 'd been shown a hand-picked group of pilots and ground staff , it was clear that the weekly practice alerts carried out by the North Koreans paid off in professionalism and speed . The colonel nodded to himself . Yes , mix the pilots he 'd seen today with the newer MiG-23s he knew were operating out of other bases , add the even more advanced planes his country was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air force . An air force capable of handling almost any mission it was given . Borodin remembered Kim Jong-I1 's cold , challenging stare . The final liberation he had said . Could he have been serious ? What was it General Petrov had said about the North Koreans ? Something about Pyongyang being almost inside the Soviet Union 's nets . Borodin began to wonder if it might not he more accurate to turn that phrase around .  | Captain Tony Christopher , USAF , stood outside the squadron building watching the sun set beyond the flight line . One hand held his gray helmet and oxygen mask . The other held a thick stack of papers  --  flight plans , bomb range restrictions , maps , and divert fields  --  all the stuff that training missions are made of . He wished again that the F-16 had a bigger cockpit . He always had a tough time squeezing his six-foot frame plus assorted paperwork into the plane . He squinted into the bright , orangish-red light thrown off by sun as it dipped toward the Yellow Sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands landed heavily on either shoulder . Tony started a bit but kept his voice calm . " Hi , Hooter . " " Shit , Saint , you 're no fun . I did that to you yesterday and you jumped three feet . " His wingman , First Lieutenant John " Hooter " Gresham , came around to stand beside him . " Yeah , well my nerves are all worn-out and I need what 's left for this mission . You 've got four ninety-four . " " I know . " Hooter looked smug . " As your friendly training records officer , I make it a point to keep fully informed . " Every pilot in the 35th Tactical Fighter Squadron did more than just play fighter jock full-time . Each also wore another " hat , " doing all the other administrative work needed to keep the squadron flying and combat-ready . Hooter 's second hat kept him busy making sure that every pilot complied with the rigorous training schedule set down by Air Force regulations . Hooter snapped his fingers . " Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to know when you want to schedule your next chemical warfare flight . "  | Tony groaned . " C'm on , Hooter . Cut me some slack . I just did it a couple of months ago ! " f looter grinned . " Nice try , revered boss and flight leader . But you and I both know that a new period started July first . And you 've got ta fill in the square once every six months . " Every pilot Tony knew hated chemical warfare training . Trying to fly a plane while wearing the special protective gear it required was like wrestling a giant octopus in a Turkish steam bath . " Okay , okay . But can I at least wait till it cools off some ? That rubber suit is hell . Just let me worry about this hop for right now . " " 1'ou got it . " I his was going to be a night ground-attack training mission , and although the I - Ifs can fly and fight at night , it does not have sophisticated sensors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see their target , Tony and I looter were going to have to coordinate their efforts : one plane would drop flares while the other made the attack run . Simple , until you remembered that each pilot would be flying at four hundred knots , so close to the ground that an unintentional twitch could turn both F-16s and their highly educated pilots into a short-lived fireball and a shallow ' rater . They needed teamwork to fly and teamwork to fight . Tony studied his s.atnily-haired wingman out of the corner of his eye . When you wear the same clothes , have the same job , and talk about the same things , you do not lose your individuality . Differences become more apparent , not less . And there were differences . It was as if somebody in the Air Force personnel office had decided to try teaming opposites as an experiment . ' limy was the quieter of the two . There is no such thing as an introverted fighter pilot , hut his unhurried movements and restrained speech contrasted sharply with I looter 's ebullient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice the wingman in almost constant motion , his boundless energy seemingly uncontainable . Tony was vastly more experienced than Hooter , which may have explained some of the difference . After the Air Force Academy , Tony had moved directly into the F-16 and had been with the aircraft from the beginning . After his initial tour he had attended Fighter Weapons School , at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada . Unlike Red Flag , which teaches air combat , Fighter Weapons School teaches how to employ effectively all types of ordnance . Only the best pilots qualify for admission . The men who graduate from that difficult course teach the rest of their squadrons what they know , which is how to best apply the Falcon 's impressive firepower against any kind of target . Additionally , it was an important ticket to be punched on the way to higher rank and more important assignments .  | After the school , Tony had continued to assimilate everything he could find , not only to stay current , but because he knew it might make the difference someday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing 's , best expert on how to blow up things with airplanes . He had been in Korea fur over half a year . Hooter , in contrast , was still in his first tour , fresh from ROTC , and had only been in Korea a few months . He was still discovering the Falcon 's good and bad points . Every flight was an adventure , an experience to be remembered . Tony welcomed Hooter 's almost constant stream of jokes and tricks , knowing that he applied the same energy to his ground duties and his flying . Also to his after-hours activities . They were only a few years apart in age , but Tony had to work hard to keep up with his younger companion . Though he 'd never have admitted it out loud , Tony knew he could n't consider himself the best flier God had ever made . He was good , damned good , but he was n't the best . Instead , he 'd found his edge in air-to-air combat with an ingrained ability to look at an adversary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other guy all over the sky . He 'd overheard Hooter talking about him in the 0-Club one night . " Now the Saint does n't fly the best plane in the sky , " his monumentally inebriated wingman had said , " but he does fly confounded tactical . " Hooter , on the other hand , was a natural shot and a demon flier , but he backed experience and sometimes he lacked good judgment . His abilities and : aggressiveness could usually get him out of the tight spots he landed in . In Tony 's book , though , " usually " was n't good enough . He 'd been working ! looter hard to get him to understand the difference between " acceptable risk " and " frigging stupid . " Still , they 'd been flying together for months now , and Tony had to admit that they made a damned good team . Their very different personalities and flying styles made a winning combination in the air . There were differences on the physical side , too . Hooter was shorter by four inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was just as well because Tony knew that his wingman had trouble keeping still anywhere . He smiled to himself . Even now he could see Hooter shifting from foot to foot while they waited to get a jeep ride out to the aircraft . betters . He came out of his thoughts as the jeep they 'd been waiting for came careening around the squadron building and slowed down to a crawl in front of them . Hooter was already in motion . " Hey , Saint ! Shake a leg . Daddy 's come to take us to the prom ! "  | Tony grinned and clambered aboard . They sped off across the tarmac toward the aircraft shelters . Their planes for the night 's mission , side numbers 492 and 494 , were parked in shelters G and H. These were reinforced concrete arches , strong enough to take anything up to a one-thousand pound bomb hit and protect the airplane inside . The armored blast doors in front and back were massive , but perfectly balanced , so that if the power drive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . They could also be sealed against poison gas . Crew chief Baines was already in shelter G waiting for him . Sergeant Baines was assigned to tail number 492 full-time . The same pilot did not fly this plane all the time , but Baines was always its crew chief . As far as he was concerned , it really belonged to him , and the pilots just " rented " it for occasional hops . The shelter was big enough to hold a twin-engine F-15 or a larger aircraft , so the single-engine F-16 " Electric Jet " looked small , almost lost . It was surrounded by the paraphernalia needed to get a Falcon in the air : a ladder , starting cart , and fire extinguisher . ' limy started his preflight . It was n't that he did n't trust the crew chief , but Baines was human . You were only allowed one error in a jet aircraft , and Tony had n't made it yet . There were pilots who made such a great show of trusting the crew chief that the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they were getting in the right aircraft . Tony remembered the time that Crew Chief Baines and his cohorts had pulled a fast one and parked a plane without an engine in the arch . The hapless aviator assigned to fly it had n't caught on until he hit the starter for the third time . Okay , then . The load : first a cigar-shaped centerline drop tank , carrying an extra three hundred gallons of fuel . The Sidewinders on the wingtips were mandatory . This was an air-to-ground mission , but you always had to be ready for air-to-air . Besides , the rails would n't carry anything but the missiles . The plane 's port inboard rack held a flare dispenser and the starboard held a cluster of practice bombs . Each bomb weighed about twenty-five pounds and had a small gunpowder charge . Just large enough to make a satisfying bang and a mark large enough to judge exactly where it had landed . Pretty harmless stuff compared to the one-ton monsters filled with Minol that the F-16 would carry on a real ground-attack mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drum held 20-millimeter ammo for the strafing runs they would practice later . Next he checked to make sure all the arming tags were removed from the ordnance and the racks . If the pins were n't taken out , the practice bombs and flares would n't drop when he pressed the release . Tony walked all the way around the plane , looking at the skin , the fueling points , the exhaust , following a mental routine he had performed almost a thousand times . He  | ended up by the ladder and signed the form Baines offered . It was now " his " airplane , at least until it was wheels down again . He climbed in and strapped himself to the seat . If he had to eject , the straps would ensure that he stayed with the ejection seat as it pulled him from the plane . Connect oxygen , g-suit umbilical , microphone lead . Tony looked at his watch : 1955 . Not bad , five minutes to engine start and all he had to do was light off the INS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inertial navigation system . It took the gyros three minutes to spin up , more time than it took to start the engine . While it did , he performed the rest of his cockpit checks . When he finished , he called his wingman on the ground frequency . " Hooter , you ready ? " " Rog , Saint , on your call . " From this point on they would use their nickname call signs exclusively . They were easier to remember than " Echo Zulu three , " and less confusing than " John " or " Tony . " There might be more than one pilot named John on a frequency , but the Wing 's call sign committee made sure there was only one Hooter and one Saint . Tony looked at his watch again . It was exactly 2000 hours . He said , " Go . " He signaled Baines , who hit the button to open the shelter 's blast doors . Tony simultaneously hit the starter and listened as the F-16 's engine spooled up . First a whine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar as he throttled to sixty-five percent power . Enough to start the ship moving . Tony called on the ground frequency , " Bluejay flight on the North Loop ready to taxi . " A disembodied voice answered in his helmet , " Bluejays , you are clear . " Time to release the wheel brakes . He started rolling and came out into the night . He looked to the left and saw Hooter leaving his arch . Tony switched to the tower frequency . " Bluejay flight rolling . " " Roger , Bluejay , you are number three for takeoff . Wind is one five zero at ten . Rolling side by side , they reached the North Loop taxiway and turned right . The 35th had its shelters dispersed around a circular asphalt taxiway as wide as a two-lane road called the North Loop . The 80th had a similar " South Loop . " As they approached the runway , they heard a two-ship formation of fighters like them take off . They rounded the last corner and saw a C-141 cargo plane lining up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearance and it started rolling . Tony called the controllers again : " Tower , Bluejay flight ' number one ' for the active . " " Roger , Bluejays . Stand by , you 're next . " The Starlifter cleared the runway , lumbering into the night sky . His  | earphones crackled with another transmission from the tower : " Bluejay cleared for takeoff . " Tony called , " Request permission for combat departure . " A short silence . " Granted . " ! looter had been monitoring the circuit , and as soon as they had permission , they rolled the planes onto the end of the runway and lined up . Bitty glanced over at his wingman and called , " Go . " They both hit the throttle , first going to one hundred percent normal power and then to afterburner , which pushed them into their seats and threw the planes down the runway . Roth l-16s quickly reached flying speed , about 100 knots . Tony held it on the runway for a few more seconds and it built up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the sky and looked over to see Hooter 's nose coming up at the same time . They raised their landing gear and flaps , and by this time they were at five hundred feet and clearing the end of the runway . I ny said , " Now . " And chopped the throttle back to military power , killing the afterburner . The noise level dropped and he banked the aircraft hard left . 1 le also thumbed a button on the stick , sending a string of small flares tailing out behind him . Hooter followed his movements . iTiitrning , killing the afterburner , and dropping flares would confuse any he ; tt - seeking missiles launched by an enemy . Combat departure takeoffs were supposed to he practiced frequently because the " simulated " enemy could turn out to he very real : North Korean commandos landed by sea with slhoulder-tired SA-7 missiles . flaying successfully gotten away from the airfield without being shot at , they climbed to five thousand feet and turned to the southeast . The range was about fifteen minutes away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude . The sun had set , allowing the ground to cool and reducing the turbulence . Tony started to relax . Unlike the States or Europe , there were few restrictions on where or how to fly . Few complaints were received about supersonic flight at treetop level . The bad guys were too close . As they approached the bombing range , Tony rocked his wings to signal Hooter and changed his Heads-Up Display  --  the HUD  --  to air-to-ground mode . He armed his practice ordnance , then descended to five hundred feet . This was the minimum peacetime altitude allowed for nighttime flight . In wartime they would fly as low as the light and terrain allowed , one hundred feet or even less . From here on , they would use wartime procedures . The target range was in a small plain , with several north-south valleys leading down to it . The two F-16s dropped into one of them , relying on the valley walls to mask their approach from enemy radars that were n't there now , but that would be if this were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the first attack . Tony rocked his  | wings again and they accelerated , changing formation . Hooter held back , allowing Tony to take the lead . He selected " Flare " on his weapons panel . The two jets screamed out onto the plain at four hundred knots . As they cleared the valley , Tony pulled up and hit the weapons release . Behind him a million-candlepower flare lit up the plain with white magnesium light . Tony imagined all the attention he would be getting right now and practiced evasive maneuvering , popping chaff and flares to decoy any missiles that might have been fired at him . The wild maneuvering alternately pushed him into his seat , then pulled him out of it . If he had n't been strapped in , his head would have been thrown against the canopy . Hooter pulled up behind Tony , too , but only until he could see the target  --  a ten-meter-wide paint mark on the ground . Then he nosed over into a shallow dive . He steadied up and pressed his stick 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the target 's location . The HUD changed , showing lines leading to the target and the range . As soon as he was happy with the lock , he increased throttle to full military power and closed on the aim point at over five hundred knots . The light from the flare was starting to fade , and shadows flickered on and off the target . The landscape streamed by , flashing past almost too fast to consciously see , and Hooter concentrated on lining his nose up exactly with the target line on the HUD . The word RELEASE flashed in the corner and he pressed the release button on the stick , simultaneously twisting it hard to the right . He grunted hard , tensing his muscles as his weight suddenly quintupled . The practice bomb flew off the rack , literally thrown toward the target as the plane turned away . They both turned south and headed out on a prearranged bearing . Hooter called , " Good timing on the flare , Saint . Any earlier and I would n't have locked on in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane against the dark night sky . " Your run looked good , Hooter . My turn now , watch the interval on approach . " They reversed roles and prepared for another run on the target . In wartime , making a second run on a now-alerted enemy was a good way to suddenly lose an airplane . But this was training , and each aircraft had enough bombs for three attack runs . Tony 's first run on the target was good , but Hooter 's evasive maneuvers were pretty limp . They switched again and Tony told John to keep one eye on him as he threw the ship around . On the next attack run , Hooter 's flare did n't ignite so they bugged out of the target area and reformed . As they turned back south for Hooter 's final go at the much-abused paint spot , Tony shifted in his seat . He was starting to get tired and he had a few runs left to go . He frowned and settled in to concentrate on the oncoming target . As Tony pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | sound in his earphones . He spared one glance at his threat display , then pushed the ship over into a six-g turn to the left . At the same time he called , " I looter ! Scrub the run and join on me ! Inbounds . " His mask pressed into his face , and he tensed his body to fight the g forces . I looter 's voice was excited . " Roger , you have the lead . I 'll come up on your right . " As lie heard his wingman 's voice in his helmet , Tony thumbed a button on his throttle . The radar display changed to air mode , the pattern on the I I t I1 ) display shifted , and the word CANNON appeared in the lower left turner . Although the bombs and Sidewinders were practice versions , the 20-nullimeter ammo in his M61 gun was live . The weapons computer automatically selected cannon when he pressed the dogfight button . As his nose swung around , the radar picked up two contacts about twenty miles out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned the radar off , to avoid revealing his position . Easing up on the turn so that Hooter could join up quicker , he looked over his right shoulder . His wingman was on burner , pulling into position alxtut a mile to the right and back . " Hooter , they 're friendlies . Safety out your ordnance and we 'll play . " " Arming phasers , Kyptin. " livay was unimpressed . " I 'm going for a nine-lima slew , then we 're going vert is ; al . " As he said this , he put the aircraft in a gentle dive since a lower altitude made them harder to spot or lock on to . Hooter followed him down automat Rally . " Rog . It 's showtime . " The range had closed to about ten miles . Still nothing visible in the night sky ahead . Tony turned the radar back on and put it in SLEW mode . A new circle appeared on his HUD marking the spot where the radar " saw " the lead bogey closing at five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over to the left , well off his line of flight . This was going to be a difficult shot , hut he was the squadron 's weapons officer . He had to teach it to everybody else . Suddenly a small box appeared around the circle  --  he was locked on . He selected the AIM-9L Sidewinder on the left wingtip and was rewarded with a growl in his headphones . The IR seeker on the missile had its target in view and was telling him with an audible signal . SHOOT appeared on the HUD and he pulled the trigger . The missiles were practice rounds without propellant or warheads , so nothing left the rail . But if it had been real , his target would be dead . Tony grinned under his oxygen mask . The video recorder would display all the data on the HUD as proof back at debrief.  | The two oncoming planes were just visible now , rushing toward him out of the starlit darkness . They were F-16s . Tony came up on the wing frequency . " Lead Falcon heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gotcha . " The missile 's growl was audible on the circuit . There was no answer , but their two opponents broke hard left , turning toward them . Tony saw it and called , " Burner . " He shoved his throttle all the way forward . As the engine responded with a satisfying roar , he pulled hack sharply on the stick . The F-16 Falcon is one of the most agile aircraft in the world . Among its other sterling qualities is an engine that puts out more thrust than the aircraft weighs . This means that it can do very interesting things , like accelerate while going straight up . They climbed , quickly passing the altitude where their two opponents were still turning left . Tony did a rapid calculation in his head and rolled the aircraft to the right , still climbing , so that he was " facing " their adversaries , who were now behind and beneath him . Hooter kept with him , hanging on to his wing as if he were glued there . Still pulling on the stick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ground , climb up the back of his canopy . He searched quickly " over " his head and was rewarded with two bright points of light  --  the two " enemy " F-16s had also gone to burner , but it was too late . They were still turning left . Diving on full burner , he pressed the cannon select button on his stick . As the radar shifted he called , " Hooter , I 'm going for a gun on the aft ship . " He heard Hooter click his mike switch twice in answer . The radar locked up immediately and he adjusted his dive slightly to put the " death dot " aiming reticle over the target . He forced himself to count " one potato , two potato " so the gyros could catch up with all his hard maneuvering . The SHOOT prompt came on again and he pulled the trigger . " Aft ship , this is Bluejay One . You 're a mort . " Hooter 's excited voice came over his phones . " Beautiful , Saint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without a word the two " enemy " planes pulled up and rocketed off for points unknown , and the Bluejays turned for base . Two blasts of afterburner had significantly reduced their fuel . " Saint , who were they ? I did n't see any other Falcons scheduled in our area tonight . " " Probably some Juvets from the 80th ordered to surprise us . I heard a rumor the wing commander was going to try something like this . " Hooter chuckled , " Well , they can surprise us like that anytime they want . " " I 'll pass . They might have been real gomers . Thank God we dropped  | enough ordnance to mark off the box . If they had interrupted us sooner , we 'd have had to repeat the mission . " " Yeah , then you would n't have safetied out the cannon . " Ti  --  n minutes later they were back at base , and it took just five minutes more to taxi to the arch . Tony climbed out of his cockpit feeling like he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g 's wears you out . It was 2130 and he and l looter still had an hour of debrief left before they could sleep . But there were two poor bastards in the 80th who 'd be up late , too , and they would n't have much fun watching their after-action videotape.  | I that he 'd been delayed . Second Lieutenant Kevin Little was more than a little worried . So far , at least , on his first real day of active duty as an Army officer , nothing ? absolutely nothing  --  had gone right . It had started with his flight into Kimpo International Airport that morning . Bad weather in Seattle had kept him from making his KAL connection in Anchorage , and he 'd had to wait for the next plane . That had turned a planned fourteen-hour trip into a full twenty-four-hour nightmare . That would have been bad enough . But then he had n't been able to get through to the battalion travel office at Camp Howze to let them know So now that he had finally gotten into Kimpo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the Eighth Army captain in charge of ground transportation at the airport was making it crystal clear that sympathy was in short supply in South Korea . " Listen , Lieutenant whatever-your-name-is , I do n't give a raggedy rat 's ass about your missing ride . We 've just come off a six-day alert and Pve got better things to do than to spend time rounding up a car and driver for every woeful , wayward , green-as-grass replacement wandering around in Korea . Like getting some sleep , for example . Got it ? " The captain kept his voice low , but Kevin could swear that every lowly PFC and clerk in the room had heard every word . Cripes , now what ? His first , miserable day in ROTC basic training flashed back to him . The captain had asked a question to which there was only one permissible answer . Kevin drew himself to attention . " Sir , yes sir . " He almost stopped  --  why was the captain 's face turning bright red ? Hurriedly he carried on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand or bus station , then ? "  | " Oh , shit , boy . . . " The man seemed to be trying hard not to laugh , " Do n't you know Americans are n't real popular around this country right now ? You might be able to get a cab , but you 'd be just as likely to end up way down in Pusan as at Camp Howze . " The captain turned to bellow at one of his sergeants standing just a few feet away . " Fergie ! See what we can do for this little lost lamb ! I guess we 're playing nursemaid today . " l lc looked hack at Kevin . " Do n't expect too much or anything too fancy . General McLaren , the Big Boss here in Korea , does n't like seeing officers spending their time riding around like some kind of foreign potentates . " The captain 's Alabama drawl stretched the word " potentates " into something that sounded vaguely obscene . ' Ilse captain yawned . " You 're lucky I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've put your case in Sergeant Ferguson 's capable hands , I 've done all that I can . " He yawned again . " If you 'll excuse me , I 've got some important paperwork to clear up . " With that , the captain sauntered into his office and closed the door . Sergeant Ferguson , a wiry , little man , motioned Kevin over to a chair . " Better take a pew , Lieutenant . This might take awhile . Not a whole lot going up toward the Z today . Should be able to get you something though . " Ile started flipping through a huge stack of papers on one of the desks . Kevin sank into the chair . Jesus , here he was . Stuck in Korea . Stuck in the hands of a bunch of Army clerks . His new battalion commander had probably already listed him as AWOL , absent without leave . He could just see writing to his parents : " Dear Mom and Dad , arriving back from Korea tonight . Please write care of Leavenworth Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office partition in misery and then sat bolt upright . The captain snored . ALONG ROUTE 3 , SOUTH KOREA Two hours later Ferguson came through and Kevin found himself in the cab of an Army supply truck trundling north toward the DMZ . Jet lag was starting to catch up with him ; he was tired , sore , and more than a little nauseous , and the truck driver , a shifty-looking corporal , seemed to delight in making hairpin turns , sudden lane changes , and ear-splitting gear shifts . The driver had n't even saluted him when he 'd climbed aboard back at Kimpo Airport , and Kevin was n't sure if he should report the man for insolence or just ignore it . Maybe they kept discipline pretty casual here in Korea  --  he just did n't know . He looked out the window to hide his discomfort . They 'd driven right along the Han River through Seoul before turning north . And Seoul , at least ,  | seemed pretty interesting . Tall , modem skyscrapers and huge freeways all built right next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place was huge , too  --  a lot bigger than Spokane or even Seattle . It must have been nearly an hour before they left the city 's sprawling suburbs behind . The countryside was n't like anything Kevin had ever seen back in the States either  --  flat , green , water-logged rice paddies reaching out all the way toward rocky , knife-edged ridges running along both sides of the highway . The tiny villages they passed looked like something out of National Geographic with brown-painted cottages topped with curving orange , green , blue , and turquoise roofs . Narrow country roads bordered by tall poplars and gently swaying willow trees bordered the highway . Kevin began to feel a bit better . Then the odor hit him . Charcoal smoke and unleaded gasoline and thick humidity rolled up into a foreign smell that seemed to magnify the strangeness of the place . The corporal chuckled a bit when he saw Kevin wrinkling his nose . " You wo n't notice the smell by tomorrow morning , sir . " If you think that 's strange , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't eat nothin ' without it . Take a bunch of red peppers , cabbage , cucumbers , radishes , and stuff , mash it all up , and let it ferment for months . You can smell kimchee all the way to Honolulu if the wind 's right . " Course , it ai n't so bad right now . You ought a smell it in July and August when the heat really comes on . " That was just about the last complete sentence Kevin could get out of him all the rest of the way to Camp Howze . CAMP HOWZE , NEAR TONGDUCH'ON , SOUTH KOREA Camp Howze looked like an Army camp . The rows of whitewashed barracks , supply warehouses , and office buildings were all laid out with straight-edged , military precision . There was a big difference , though , from the stateside bases Kevin had seen . The camp was surrounded by barbed wired and cleared fields of fire , and he could see camouflaged bunkers guarding the main gate . A large sign declared that Camp Howze was " HQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2nd Infantry Division . " The driver let him off right in front of the main entrance and watched while Kevin hauled his bags out of the back of the truck . Then , without a word , the corporal wheeled his truck around and drove off back west toward the highway . A sergeant walked down from the gate to meet him . " Reporting in , sir ? " Kevin nodded , fumbling in his jacket pocket for his travel orders . " My plane was late . I was supposed to be here last night . " The sergeant glanced through his orders . " Yes , sir . Battalion left word that you 're to report to Major Donaldson , the XO , as soon as you arrive . "  | Kevin looked down at the pile of baggage at his feet and was acutely aware that he desperately needed a shower and shave to look , feel , and smell human . The sergeant smiled . " I think you could interpret that order a little loosely , Lieutenant . I do n't think we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another half-hour . In the meantime , we 'll get you up to the BOQ . " The sergeant broke off to yell up at the two privates watching from the gate . " Malloy , Brunner ! Move your lazy asses down here and help the lieutenant with his bags . " He turned back to Kevin . " Welcome to Camp Howze , sir . " A quick shower at the BOQ the bachelor officers ' quarters  --  left him feeling a lot better , but Kevin still had knots in his stomach when he knocked on Major Donaldson 's door . " Come . " He opened the door , stepped inside , marched toward Donaldson 's desk , and came to attention . " Reporting in as ordered , sir . " Damn , why did his voice have to break every time he tried to sound properly military ? Major Colin Donaldson , a short , square-jawed man , looked Kevin over carefully for a brief moment , with all the studied disinterest of a man eyeing a horse he might want to buy someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were being x-rayed . He wondered what Donaldson saw . lie knew he was n't tall  --  barely average in fact . And though ROTC exercises and training marches had kept him in good shape , with a trim , flat stomach and muscular arms and legs , Kevin also knew he 'd inherited his father 's stocky build along with the older man 's straw-colored hair and pale blue eyes . His father only kept his weight down by working from sunup to sundown on the family 's Eastern Washington ranch . The Littles did n't have much choice , Kevin thought . It was either sweat or grow fat . Feeling self-conscious under Donaldson 's gaze , Kevin held his shoulders back and head rigid , resisting the temptation to scope out the maps and personal mementos scattered throughout the major 's office . He had the feeling this was n't the right time to give his innate curiosity full rein . Not by a long shot . In fact , if he 'd learned anything in the ROTC , it was that there was always a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructors had made that painfully clear to him over three summers of basic and advanced training . It had been a difficult lesson to learn . Curiosity , brains , and the itch for adventure were a large part of why Kevin was n't back home herding beef cattle from one sun-baked hill to the other . If he 'd been the average kid in Ellensburg , Washington , he 'd never have wanted to go to college . And if he had n't wanted to go to college , he 'd never have signed up with the ROTC to pay for it . And now his service obligations to the U.S. Army had landed him smack dab in the middle of this camp just south of the DMZ . Part of him was still pissed off . South Korea had n't been what he 'd  | bargained for , and his orders to report there had come as both a shock and a disappointment . But another part of him was excited . This posting was sure to be a lot more interesting than the godforsaken spots in Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shipped off to . After what seemed like an eternity , Donaldson pushed his chair back and came around the desk with his hand held out . At ease , Lieutenant . I ai n't going to bite your head off . " He shook Kevin 's hand , waved him into a chair , and then perched himself on the corner of his desk . Kevin thought he should explain why he was late . " Sir , I 'm sorry I did n't get here on schedule , but you see , my plane was ? " Donaldson interrupted . " Do n't worry about it , Lieutenant . We do n't expect our officers to control the weather , or even the airlines . Eighth Army phoned this morning to let us know what happened to you . " He paused for a moment . " But do n't get the idea you can be late from now on . I 'm going to expect your platoon to be ready to move when I say move ' and to jump when I give the word . Clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled then . " Donaldson pulled a file off his desk and started leafing through it . There did n't seem to be much in it . " Now , I see from your service record that you 've had some language training . That was in Korean , I hope . " Kevin could n't quite keep the bitterness out of his voice . " No , sir . I took four years of German in college  --  I never expected to . . . " He decided it might not be a good idea to finish the sentence . Donaldson looked over at him , amusement clearly showing in his eyes . " You never expected to get sent to Korea , Lieutenant ? " " Well , sir , no . No , I did n't . I applied for an Army Intelligence posting in West Germany . " Donaldson shook his head . " Let me get this straight . You took years of German , probably studied their politics and culture and all that stuff real hard , and then you expected the Army to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file back on the desk . " Welcome to the real U.S. Army , Mr. Little . Let me clue you in on a well-known secret . The Army moves in mysterious ways . It does n't send you where you want to go , or even where you 're best suited to go . It sends you where you 're needed . " Donaldson stood suddenly , walked over to a map of South Korea , and jabbed it with a finger . And that 's right here , Lieutenant . It just so happens that we 're short a platoon leader in this battalion . That 's going to be your job for the next twelve months . You read me , Lieutenant ? " Kevin remembered the Eighth Army captain 's laughter at his cadet salute , so he simply nodded . " Yes , sir . I 'll do my best . "  | Donaldson smiled again . " Good . I know you will . Now let me bring you up to speed on your assignment . " He walked back over to his desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company . That 's Captain Matuchek 's mob . Matuchek 's a damned good officer , so you live up to his standards and you 'll go far . You 'll also stay clear of trouble and off my shit list  --  which is exactly where you want to stay . " The major handed him a thick folder . " Here are the personnel records for your troops . Get to know them . Get to know which ones you can depend on and which you 've got to watch . But remember , those records are just paper . They do n't tell the whole story . You get to know the real men  --  the ones behind the paper  --  and you 'll do all right . " Kevin did n't know what to say to that , so he just nodded again  --  feeling a hit like one of those little bouncing dogs some people stick on their car 's dashboard . I le looked up as Donaldson asked , " Now tell me , who 's the one man you can rely on to set you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally make sure you look and act like a proper young lieutenant ? " This sounded like some kind of test , but it seemed straightforward enough . " Captain Matuchek , sir . " " No . No , Lieutenant , it ai n't Captain Matuchek . He 's got a lot better things to do than try to keep you in line . No , the man you 'd better rely on pretty damn heavily is your platoon sergeant . He 's the one with the experience and the motivation to keep you from screwing up too badly . " Donaldson looked down at him . And that 's where you 're a lucky man , Lieutenant . Your platoon sergeant , Sergeant Pierce , is a fine soldier  --  one of the best . He 's a combat vet . Did two tours in Nam . So you listen up real close when Sergeant Pierce suggests ' something . It just may save your platoon in a shooting situation . May even save your life , too . " The major stood . " Okay , Lieutenant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his watch . " It 's eleven twenty-five hours now . Your troops wo n't get back from the firing range till fifteen hundred . So get some lunch , study those records , and then go over and get acquainted with your men . Any questions ? " Kevin did , but this did n't seem like the right time to ask about transfer application procedures . He shook his head , stuffed the platoon personnel files under his arm , and saluted . Donaldson returned his salute lazily and turned to some of the paperwork piled up on his desk . But as Kevin headed for the door , Donaldson 's voice stopped him . " One more thing , Lieutenant . Forget most of the crap they drummed into you in ROTC . " He pronounced it " Rot-see . " " It ai n't going to help you worth a damn in dealing with real soldiers . "  | Excluding the commanding officer , a full-strength U.S. " leg " infantry rifle platoon contains forty-five men , and all forty-five of them were lined up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whitewashed building housing the 2nd Platoon , A Company , 1st Battalion , 39th Infantry Regiment . " Attention ! " A loud , bull-like roar brought the troops up straight and nearly gave Kevin a case of premature cardiac arrest . He 'd hoped to come in quietly and talk to the platoon sergeant before officially assuming command . Scratch Plan A. Too bad he did n't have any Plan B. A big man wearing sergeant 's stripes stepped out of the ranks and saluted him . " Welcome to Second Platoon , sir . I 'm Sergeant Harry Pierce . " Pierce was even taller than Kevin and probably outweighed him by at least fifty pounds  --  all of it in muscle . He wore his graying hair in a crew cut so short it was almost invisible . Kevin knew he could n't just stand there gaping like some kind of idiot . He cleared his throat . " Thank you , Sergeant . Ah . . . " Cripes , now what was he supposed to do , make a speech or something ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platoon , sir ? " His tone made it clear that this was one of those " suggestions " that Donaldson had talked about , and Kevin felt grateful . The sergeant seemed to be doing his best to keep him from looking too stupid . Kevin nodded , trying to act as if taking over a platoon was just an everyday occurrence for him . " Yes , Sergeant . I certainly would . " Jeez , that sounded pretty pompous . Well , he 'd just have to drive on . Pierce led him along the row of soldiers lined up by their bunks . Names and faces flashed by Kevin so fast that he knew he 'd never remember more than a tenth of them . PFC Donnelly , 1st Squad Leader Corporal Kostowitz , PFC Simpson , his radioman , Corporal Jones , Weapons Squad Leader Corporal Ramos , and on and on . The equipment he saw looked in pretty good shape , although Kevin knew he 'd have had trouble telling the difference between a really well-cared for weapon and one that had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously knew his business , and he had n't taken any names  --  so everything must have been A-okay . There was just one thing left out of the inspection , and when they reached the end of the line , Kevin turned to Pierce . " I 'd like to take a look at the APCs , too , Sergeant . I assume they 're parked over at the motor pool ? " Kevin heard a muffled chuckle , or maybe it was just a cough , from somewhere in his new platoon . He reddened . Now what ? Pierce flashed a warning glance into the ranks and kept his voice low . " We  | do n't have any armored personnel carriers , Lieutenant . The battalions in the Second and Third Brigades here in Korea are pure foot soldiers . We 've got trucks to get us up to the Z and back again . But anywhere else we want to go , we walk  --  just like the old days . " Oh , shit . He should have remembered that from the briefing paper they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just slipped out of his brain somewhere along the way . " Right . I suppose that 's because we 'll be fighting from bunkers and the other fortifications up at the DMZ  --  if it ever comes to that . " Jesus , that sounded professorial as all hell . Pierce eyed him calmly . " Yes , sir . That 's about the size of it . Plus the fact that mechanized stuff does n't do too well plowing through rice paddies or trying to climb the bastard-steep hills they 've got around here . " Kevin nodded as if Pierce was just confirming everything he 'd known all along . I le had the uncomfortable feeling , though , that he had n't fooled anyone-  --  and certainly not the platoon sergeant . I le 'd better get out of here before he said anything else that was laughably ignorant . Ile clasped his hands behind his back . " Well , Sergeant , the platoon looks fine . Carry on with today 's schedule . See me in my quarters after chow tonight , and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Okay ? " Pierce saluted . " Yes , sir . " The sergeant wheeled to face the troops still standing in ranks . All right , you heard the lieutenant . You know what you 're supposed to be doing . Now , move . " The troops broke ranks  --  the polished image of unity and order vanishing in a split second , changing instead into a milling crowd of individuals who just happened to be wearing the same clothes . Kevin looked around him , trying hard to conceal his uncertainty . He was n't ready for this . By rights he should be sitting at a desk on a base near some little German village , evaluating the latest intelligence reports coming in from across the Iron Curtain . Korea had n't been in his plans at all . Damn it , it just was n't fair . He 'd joined the ROTC to help pay for college and to see the world . But not to wind up making an ass out of himself in front of a bunch of tough , professional soldiers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was doing so far . Pierce 's deep voice broke into Kevin 's thoughts . " Do n't worry , Lieutenant . It is n't really as difficult as it might seem . You 've got a good group of troops here . I 've worked ' em hard and they 're ready for just about anything . " Kevin nodded . The men of his new command might be ready . But he sure as hell wasn't.  | Cigarette smoke fogged the small , wood-paneled conference room , and Blake Fowler , his eyes watering , wondered why so many people in the intelligence community still smoked . Was it nerves or just the desire to look tough ? He could barely make out the wall clock through the haze . It was just after five in the evening . Outside the Old Executive Office Building 's Victorian walls and gables , Washington 's streets were filling up as tens of thousands of career government workers headed home  --  fighting their way through traffic that seemed to get worse with every passing day . Fowler laughed inwardly . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an immobile car . He looked around the crowded conference table . Almost everyone in the Korean Interagency Working Group had arrived . First , Mike Dolan from the CIA , a middling-tall , pug-nosed Boston Irishman with hair as black as night and an infectious devil-may-care grin . Fowler had always thought Dolan looked more like a middleweight boxer than a spy , and he had the feeling that was how the CIA agent wanted it . In contrast , plump , smooth-featured , pipe-smoking Alan Voorhees looked exactly like what he was , an academic turned Department of Commerce bureaucrat  --  complete with stylish Adam Smith tie and expensive leather briefcase . Voorhees was deep in conversation with a tall , ramrod-straight black man who would never be mistaken for a mere bureaucrat . Even in a pin-striped , double-breasted suit , Brigadier General Dennis Scott looked as though he belonged in uniform . Fowler knew the Defense Intelligence Agency representative was nearing fifty , but only the gray speckled through his hair provided the slightest clue to his age . Scott still left younger opponents gasping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | Waspish little Carleton Pickering of the National Security Agency was barely visible beyond the general . Pickering 's keen eyes , thick , bushy eyebrows , and fussy , precise voice had been a Washington intelligence community fixture for years . The tiny , fox-faced analyst had an uncanny ability to turn the tiniest fragments of raw intelligence into a polished and plausible picture of enemy intentions , activities , and capabilities . The door suddenly slammed shut behind the Pentagon 's representative , a bluff , hearty Navy captain named Ted Carlson . He swaggered to the corner coatrack , shrugged off his damp overcoat , and then whipped off his plasticcovered uniform cap . Water droplets cascaded from the cap onto the carpet . Carlson grinned at his startled colleagues and took an empty chair near Fowler . One man was n't there . Tolliver , the prep school kid from the State Department , was late again  --  as usual . Fowler had called State to find out where he was , only to be told by Tolliver 's secretary that he was in another meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , he could get there . Well , Tolliver could play catch-up on his own time . Fowler rapped gently on the table , breaking through a hum of quiet shoptalk . " We 've got a fair amount of material to cover this evening , gentlemen . So let 's get the show on the road . I , for one , would like to get home before midnight . " General Scott smiled . " Not going to wait for our little friend from Foggy Bottom ? " He did n't seem too upset by the prospect . Pickering leaned forward , a slight smile on his narrow face . " I do n't think Tolliver is likely to get here anytime soon . I hear the Secretary 's given him a new job  --  he 's working on the American desk these days . " Fowler and the others chuckled softly . It was an old joke but just true enough to stay funny . State Department " desks " were charged with keeping track of the issues and interests of particular countries . And the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State had a similar organization to protect American interests  --  interests they sometimes felt were overlooked by the striped-pants diplomats in Foggy Bottom . As the laughter died down , Fowler looked over at the CIA 's representative on the Working Group . " Mike , why do n't you kick things off tonight . " When they 'd first assembled the group , he 'd asked Dolan to keep them up to speed on current events behind the scenes in Seoul . It had been a natural assignment . All the men sitting around the table had some measure of expertise in Asian political and military affairs , but the CIA had the best collection of sources in the region . Dolan stubbed his cigarette out in an ashtray . " Yeah , okay . " He pushed the ashtray away . " I got a telex from our people just before I came here tonight . "  | " Things are still fairly quiet in the streets . But that wo n't last long . NSP says the students are planning more demonstrations . And our people over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Seoul National University , but the leaders they need to grab have all gone underground . " Dolan handed the multipage telex he 'd summarized over to Fowler . " What about the official report they promised on the massacre ? " Voorhees looked as though he really believed it might solve their Korean problem . Dolan snorted . " Our sources say it 's going to be released tomorrow . But it sure as hell is n't going to improve the situation . " He waved a hand toward Fowler . " You called that one right , Blake . It looks like they 're going to try to blame some lowly police officer for the order to fire . And he very conveniently got himself killed in the riot . " Grim laughter from the other members of the Working Group interrupted him . " And just in case no one buys that , they 're going to announce the simultaneous resignation of the Home Affairs minister . Apparently , he 's been chosen to play the part of the sacrificial lamb . " General Scott cleared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle anything . I 've met the man 's deputy and he 's even more of a hard case than his boss . The bastard 's probably the one who really gave the police orders to meet that demonstration with force . " Dolan nodded . " You 've got it right , Denny . What 's more , the students and opposition leaders know that as well as we do  --  probably better . The trouble is , nothing short of a complete government surrender will satisfy them now . And the government is n't going to hang out the white flags anytime soon . " Fowler and the others around the table knew what that meant . More demonstrations , more riots , and probably , more blood in South Korea 's streets . Fowler sighed . " Okay , all of that makes our analysis of the Barnes bill even more important . Legislative Affairs still says the bill wo n't make it to the floor , but it 's already getting more press attention than they 'd predicted . " He looked down at his notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House Foreign Affairs Committee is planning to mark it up tomorrow morning . " The others sat up a little more sharply . A bill markup was the action stage for a congressional committee . Hearings were n't really important  --  markups were where the real work got done . " Jesus , they 're moving pretty damned fast , are n't they ? " Captain Carlson sounded worried . " C'm on , Ted . You know what the Foreign Affairs Committee 's like . If those guys bent any more to the left , they 'd fall right over on their asses . "  | Scott 's contemptuous assessment won agreeing murmurs from around the table . The general continued , " And everybody knows that Barnes and that son-of-a-hitch Dugan are like that . " He held up two crossed fingers to represent the Trade subcommittee chairman and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee . Fowler and the others nodded . Barnes and Dugan were both from the same wing of their political party , and they 'd been allies for years . They could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected from their counterparts in the Senate . Fortunately , though , the bill still had to run the gauntlet of the Armed Services committees on both sides of the I lilt  --  and those committees , though less conservative than in past years , still leaned more to the right than the left . Which was nice to know , but it did n't move them any closer to putting out a single , consistent administration policy paper on the legislation . Fowler tapped his typed agenda . " Okay , next item . The trade sanctions provisions our friend Mr. Barnes has in his bill . We 've already agreed on language spelling out just what they would do to importers and exporters in this country . The key question is , will the sanctions work ? " He glanced around the table . Voorhees took the pipe out of his mouth . " You mean , will they force the South Korean government to reform ? " The Commerce Department representative sat hack further in his chair . " No . I do n't know about the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Koreans are too proud . Giving in to Barnes would seem as had to them as surrendering in a war . " Dolan hacked him up  --  something that was probably a first . " Hell , the South Koreans are even more stubborn than the fucking South Africans . They are n't going to do diddly damned all just because the U.S. Congress threatens them . " Fowler stared down at his notes as the discussion rose and fell around him . Everything he 'd seen during his year of postgraduate work in Seoul and everything the other Working Group members said tended to confirm Dolan 's offhanded assessment . And that raised an ugly scenario . If the Barnes bill somehow made it through the congressional gauntlet , the South Koreans would n't meekly buckle under before its threatened sanctions went into place . They 'd try to tough it out  --  at a potentially catastrophic cost to their own economy . Over the last several years the South Koreans had run up a forty-plus billion dollar foreign debt to modernize their country . They 'd produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultramodern factories , universities , all the infrastructure of a powerful industrial state . But it was an economic miracle that rested on a single , somewhat shaky base : exports . Back in 1984 fully a third of South Korea 's gross national product  | had come from its sales overseas . To pay its foreign debts , South Korea had to run large trade surpluses with the rest of the world in each and every year . If the Barnes trade sanctions went into effect , South Korea would lose most , if not all , of its single largest market almost overnight . And Fowler knew that the Europeans and Japanese would probably be close behind the l ) nited States in imposing protectionist tariffs on Korean products . They faced the same kinds of domestic political pressure groups as the U.S. Congress , and they 'd already shown an even greater willingness to surrender to them . And unlike South Africa , Iran , or Libya , where trade sanctions had failed tuiserably , South Korea did n't produce any irreplaceable products . Its companies had prospered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships more cheaply than their competitors . But nobody 's economy would collapse without access to Samsung TVs or Hyundai cars . Fowler frowned . The economic risks for South Korea were clear . What would happen to a country whose whole economy rested on exports if the rest of the world suddenly turned off the cash flow ? Whatever it was , it would n't be anything good . He flipped to the next page of his notes , taking a discrete look at his watch while he did it . These meetings went pretty smoothly without having to listen to interminable speeches from the State Department 's Tolliver . Maybe he could have Katie " forget " to notify Tolliver about the next session . It was a tempting thought and he knew he 'd have to work hard to resist it . He studied the other men around the table . " We 've all seen Ted 's paper analyzing the provisions in the Barnes bill that would force us to withdraw American troops from South Korea . He argues that the timetables for withdrawal would be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions or comments ? " The others shook their heads , but Carlson wanted to supplement his earlier written report . " Do n't forget that it 'd be godawful expensive , too . You 're talking about shipping three squadrons of fighters , six artillery battalions , SAM batteries , helicopters , and a whole damned infantry division all the way across the Pacific . " Scott whistled . " Son of a bitch . That 'd tie up a pretty big percentage of our strategic sea- and airlift assets . " Carlson nodded . " I 've got my staff running studies now . We should have some hard numbers in a couple of days or so . " Fowler scribbled a reminder to himself to follow up on that . " Okay . So we 'd have trouble implementing the withdrawal provisions on time and they 'd cost an arm and a leg . Plus , providing the ships and planes to move our troops would eat into our ability to respond quickly to crises in other parts of the world . " Ile looked up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolan answered for everyone . " Heap big white man from NSC speakum truth . " The others around the conference table laughed . Fowler grinned . Trust Dolan to keep him from getting too comfortable in the chairman 's chair . He put his pen down . " That 's settled then . But do my Indian brothers have anything to say about the military effects of pulling the Great White Father 's soldiers out of Korea ? " That sobered them up . General Scott spoke up first . " It 'd be a damned big mistake  --  no ifs , ands , or huts about it . " " I do n't se-. it , Denny . " Voorhees shook his head . " We 've got , what , maybe forty thousand men over there . Okay , that sounds like a lot . But the South Koreans have more than six hundred thousand troops . They do n't need us to keep the peace anymore . " " Bullshit . " Scott obviously did n't believe in mincing his words . " Sure the South Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But those bastards on the other side of the DMZ are just as tough and they stay put for one damned good reason . " Scott held up a single finger . " Because the last time they tried invading , we kicked their butts all the way back across the thirty-eighth parallel . " Blake agreed with the general , but knew that he 'd skipped over a few things like the fact that it had taken three years of hard fighting and more than fifty thousand American dead to win the uneasy truce along the Korean Demilitarized Zone . Voorhees looked unconvinced . Dolan broke in . " Look , Alan , the trouble is that the military threat South Korea laces has been growing dramatically over the last few years . There 's a lot going on up there in Pyongyang that we need to be worried about . " " Like what ? And do n't give me some kind of need to know ' runaround . I 've got Code Word clearance just like the rest of you . " Dolan eyed Voorhees calmly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been supplying the North Koreans with first-line combat aircraft . Like the fact that Kim 11-Sung and his boys are getting advanced tanks , artillery , and surface-to-surface rockets for the first time ever . Like the fact that North Korea 's resident chief lunatic Kim has given the Soviets overflight rights and access to his naval bases  --  something that he 's refused to do for more than thirty years . " " Oh , come on , guys . " Voorhees laughed , a bit nervously . " You ca n't tell me you 're going to try feeding everyone the old the Russians are coming , the Russians are coming ' bullshit . No one 's going to buy it . What kind of confirmation do you have ? I mean , could n't this stuff just be rumors spread around by the NSP to keep us backing the South Korean government ? " Fowler decided it was time to intervene . " Some of it may be . But not all of it . Our satellites have caught glimpses of new equipment being fed into  | the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warships and planes in and around North Korea . " He paused for a moment . " So we know for sure that North Korea 's engaged in a sizable military buildup . What we ca n't get is solid data on what they plan to do with all that hardware . And in a way , that makes the situation we face worse . We can estimate the North 's capabilities but we ca n't guess their intentions . That means we 've got to plan for the worst case . " He looked over at Dolan . " Your people have n't been able to get anyone inside North Korea , have they ? " Dolan shook his head . " No . We do n't have a single agent on the ground up there . The damned place is too regimented , too paranoid to infiltrate . We 've worked with the NSP for decades to try to plant somebody . It never works . They go in. . . and they do n't ever , ever come out . " Scott agreed . " Yeah . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some of the Japanese companies that do business there . And we ca n't confirm much of that . " Time to bring it home . Fowler looked straight into Voorhees 's eyes . " So what we 've got , Alan , is a country that 's already militarized beyond all reason . A country that 's certainly acquiring even more weaponry . And a country that has a forty-year-old track record of aggression , assassination , and terrorism . Just how do you suggest we should interpret those facts ? " Fowler studied Voorhees 's face carefully . He looked less sure of himself than he 'd been before . Good . They had to convince him that there could be an increased military threat if the Barnes troop withdrawal provisions went into effect . If they did n't , Voorhees might talk his boss , the Secretary of Commerce , into disapproving the Working Group 's report . That would n't please George Putnam one little bit . More importantly , it would set the stage for still another disjointed administration response to half-baked congressional legislation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Alan take a look at your latest assessment of North Korea 's military capabilities . " Dolan nodded back slowly , a barely perceptible smile on his face . " Sure thing . " He turned to Voorhees . " I 'd be happy to messenger over the file anytime you want to see it . " Voorhees looked around the table . He obviously knew he was outnumbered , and Fowler had offered him a face-saving way out . He nodded . " Okay . I 'll take a look at it . If what you say about the Soviets ' boosting North Korea 's military capabilities is true . . . " Voorhees paused . " Well , I 'd have to say that would show that an American troop withdrawal could cause some problems . " Fowler fought hard not to smile . They had him . Voorhees might not be completely convinced , but he was n't going to oppose the group 's analysis .  | He glanced down at his watch again . God , it was getting late . It was time to declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled his notes back into order . " Does anyone have anything else they want to go over for now ? " There was silence from around the table . " Right . Okay , I 'll finish putting together a draft position paper on the bill . I should have something to send around for comment by tomorrow night . " Carlson spoke for the others . " When do you need it back ? " He looked unhappy . He was probably worried about missing the next Redskins game . Fowler knew he had season tickets . " Frankly , as soon as possible . Sorry , Ted , but Putnam 's really breathing down my neck on this one . And with the bill going into markup , he might not he so far off base . Maybe you can take it to the game with you . " Carlson laughed . Fowler stuffed his papers back into his briefcase . " Seriously , I 've got a feeling the clock 's running on this one , guys . And we 'd better get our pl , iyhook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The other members of the Working Group nodded , gathered up their own notes , and filed out of the room . Fowler headed back to his office . The meeting had gone pretty well . Unless he 'd completely misread the signals , the others agreed that the Barnes bill should be vigorously opposed . There 'd he the usual back-and-forth tussle over the exact wording , but in the end he should be able to get them to approve a clear , concise paper recommending that course to the President . Fowler knew that might prove vital . From what he could gather from the nightly news and in shoptalk around the office , the Barnes Korean sanctions hill was gathering support left and right  --  though mostly from the left . Unions , church and human rights groups , so-called public interest organizations , and activists of every stripe were out beating the drums , sending in postcards , and holding press conferences . One of the farmers ' groups had even come out in support of the Barnes bill . They 'd been pissed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American agricultural products . It was beginning to look as if it were open season on South Korea . It also looked as if he and his trusty computer were among the few standing in the steamroller 's path . He stopped in the hallway , stifled a yawn , and laughed to himself . Talk about delusions of grandeur . He must be catching the " Washington disease " ? the curious belief that everything everywhere depended on one 's own actions . He 'd have thought he was immune to it , but perhaps it stole quietly into the brain  --  drawn in from the long , echoing marble corridors , from the flags , the statues of great men long dead , and from the tingling , ever present sensation of power that you felt from the very first moment you wore a security badge . He walked on , idly fingering the badge hanging from a chain around his  | neck . It did n't matter . He had a policy paper to write , regardless of whether the importance he attached to it was real or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight . He came in the door as quietly as he could . The town house they rented in suburban northern Virginia seemed well enough built , but it was small and sounds carried far at night . He left the hall light off and felt his way along past his daughter 's bedroom . He stopped for a moment at her door , listening for a change in her breathing . Part of him almost hoped she 'd wake up . Kary was five , growing up fast , and he 'd scarcely seen her for the past several months . But he kept moving . She was in school now . She needed all the sleep she could get . Mandy had left the window blinds in the master bedroom open  --  letting in a soft white glow from the moon that gave him just enough light to avoid stumbling into the furniture . He undressed hurriedly , draping his suit pants , shirt , and tie over a chair . Fowler shivered . The August heat wave had finally broken only a couple of weeks ago , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses , watch , and security badge on the nightstand by the bed and slid under the covers . A warm hand came up to gently stroke his face . He opened his eyes to see his wife propped up on one elbow . She smiled and bent down over him . " Hi , there . Glad you 're home . " God , she was beautiful . The moonlight gleamed in his wife 's corn-silkfine , blond hair and illuminated her pert , freckled nose , delicate , oval face , and baby-blue eyes . His heart turned over with a thump , and he felt a sense of childlike wonder that it still did that whenever he saw her . Even after seven years of marriage . He and Mandy had met as graduate students on a summer studies tour of Japan , and he 'd fallen head over heels in love with her in hours  --  bowled over by the combination of beauty , intelligence , and a husky , Southern voice . He still did n't know exactly what she 'd seen in him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , despite the constant strain imposed by the hundred-hour workweeks his job often demanded . And it was n't just a strain on him , he thought guiltily . He never seemed to be around when Kary was sick or Mandy needed his help . They 'd exchanged some cold words over times like that . But so far they 'd both been able to find their way back into love out of the cold . So far . Still , there were a lot of days when he regretted the pride and ambition that had made him forsake a quiet , university teaching career for the " glamor " of an NSC staff post . Fowler reached both arms around her , holding her close , marveling at her warmth . " Sorry I 'm so late . " He kissed her neck . " I should have called . " She sighed , wriggling closer still so that she lay pressed against him . " It would have been nice . But after I saw the news reports , I knew you 'd be  | late . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fowler , I did n't file a missing person 's report . " He tensed . He had n't even turned on the office television that evening . " What happened ? Was it something about Korea ? " He could almost feel Mandy 's surprise . " I thought you knew . They had another riot somewhere over there with more shooting . Someplace called Kwangju , I think . It was on the eleven-o'clock news . " Damn . Goddamnit . The South Koreans were their own worst enemies . 1 le reached over for his glasses and badge as the phone started to ring . SEPTEMBER 21-HEADQUARTERS , REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARMED FORCES Jack McLaren sipped his tea appreciatively and set his cup down . He met the eyes of the four-star general sitting across from him . " Aju masisumnida . It 's very delicious . " General Park , Chairman of the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff , smiled politely . " Your Korean is improving greatly , General McLaren . Someday I am sure I will mistake you for one of my countrymen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform fitted his wiry frame precisely . He was obviously in excellent condition . " Thank you . But you 're already much more fluent in my language than I will ever he in yours . " General Park bowed slightly to acknowledge the compliment . " Would you care for some more of this tea ? Or perhaps there is something else I can offer you that would be more to your taste ? " Yeah , McLaren thought , how about putting an end to all this pussyfooting around and getting down to business . He controlled the urge to let his impatience show plainly . In Rome , you spoke Italian . In Bonn , you drank beer . And in Seoul , you suffered through half an hour of meaningless pleasantries before it was considered polite to talk seriously . He had to admit , though , that he 'd seen meetings in Washington that might have gone more smoothly had those involved spent a little time getting to know each other better . But he already knew General Park all too well . Park 's combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very good . He 'd been deeply involved in politics since then , though , and it showed . McLaren understood the disdain military men like General Park felt for the fractious politicians and the unending political disputes South Korea seemed to breed , but he did n't see how they thought they could do much better . Hell , you could n't run a growing , prosperous country along strict military lines forever , and if you developed the kinds of political skills  | needed to run a democracy , you wound up just being another politician like all the rest . And Park was almost all politician these days . McLaren drained his teacup and shook his head as Park 's aide leaned forward to pour more tea . The Korean general delicately set his own cup hack on the tray and motioned his aide out of the room . Park sat back in his chair . " There , my friend , we are alone now . " He smiled . " So we are free to discuss things . . . candidly , as you Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First things first . I 'd like to commend your troops for the way they handled that NK commando raid near Ulchin this morning . That was damned fine work . " A group of North Korean commandos had been landed by submarine , with a mission somewhere inland . While not routine , the North launched such a raid approximately once a month . Their usual missions included sabotage and assassination . Whatever mayhem had been planned this time , the heavy defenses that ringed the coast had stopped it cold , right on the beach . " They were simply doing their duty . But of course I shall be happy to pass your commendation on to their division commander . He will be delighted , I am sure , to receive praise from the commander of all our Combined Forces . " McLaren heard the carefully controlled bitterness in Park 's voice but let it pass . He 'd known this was a difficult command situation before he 'd accepted the assignment to head allied forces in South Korea . The South Koreans , understandably , were increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general with forty thousand troops in charge of the entire six-hundred-thousand-man South Korean military . He looked straight into Park 's eyes before continuing . " But I ca n't go along with this last request of yours . There simply are no valid military reasons to pull the 3rd Infantry Division back from the DMZ to the interior . " Park 's face was impassive . " I must protest your hasty decision . Surely your staff has shown you the figures on the recent upsurge of attempted communist landings . " " Yes , my South Korean staff officers have shown me their studies . But I also know that the forces already in place along the coast have n't had much trouble coping with these latest landings . They do n't need reinforcements . " McLaren leaned forward . " Look , General . I 'm well aware that you want those men posted back in the cities to help you control these student demonstrations . And I 'm sure you 're equally well aware that my country simply ca n't countenance the use of regular military forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Park 's anger was starting to show . " These riots are being sparked by terrorist agitators . My government is not facing simple  | crowds of unruly students . These radicals are being led by a hard-core communist cadre . " " Bullshit . " Damn . McLaren was glad there were no State Department flunkies around to hear his undiplomatic language . But that was what they got for sending a combat soldier on a diplomatic fishing expedition . " Cut the crap , General . I do n't doubt for a minute that the bastards up in Pyongyang are salivating over all the trouble down here . But do n't try to feed inc that stuff about these students being controlled by the commies . It ai n't going to wash  --  here or in Washington . " Surprisingly , General Park smiled . " Very well . If you can speak so bluntly , then so can I. But I shall deny ever having said this , you understand ? " McLaren nodded . Well , well , so Park had n't really expected him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth is that my government must restore order in our cities . . . and we must do so quickly . " Park lowered his voice . " As you know , we have a ... how do you say it ? A tradition of military intervention to bring order out of chaos . " McLaren nodded again . South Korea 's military had jumped into the political fray in 1961 and 1979 . " Go on . " " There are officers , junior-grade officers to be sure , but officers nonetheless , who are becoming unhappy with the way the government is handling this latest crisis . They believe we have been indecisive , even weak , in responding to these student provocations . " " So . l lave your Defense Security Command deal with these officers . Hell , that 's what you 've got it for , is n't it ? " McLaren could n't see the problem . The I ) efense Security Command was a vast , shadowy organization maintained solely to protect the South Korean government from coup attempts by its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces command , with instructions to keep a close eye on all goings on . And all South Korean officers were subject to rapid and unexplained transfers whenever it seemed that they might be becoming too popular with their troops . It was a system that reduced military effectiveness , but it did provide the government with a powerful check on any overly ambitious officers . But Park shook his head . " The grumbling is too widespread . If we took hasty action against just a few of these men , the others might be driven into an unfortunate decision . " Uh huh , McLaren thought , an " unfortunate decision " that would end the careers of a certain number of government officials  --  like General Park , for example . Park looked closely at him . " So you see , General McLaren , it is essential that we bring this rioting to an end . The Combat Police are having trouble doing that . You must allow us to use our soldiers to restore order . It is necessary . "  | Cute . Very cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it simply wanted soldiers for riot duty , could use its " black beret " Special Forces troops  --  men who were n't under the Combined Forces Command . But using regular units , units nominally under his orders , would send a signal throughout Korea and around the world that the United States gave its full backing to whatever measures the South Korean government used to quell student dissent . Well , he was n't going to play that game . " No dice , General . If your government wants to end these demonstrations , I suggest you rely on the police to do it . And if I were you , I 'd tread more carefully in the way you go about it . If you 've been following events hack in the States at all , you know the Congress is giving the administration hell right now about our involvement over here . " Park sat rigid in his chair for a moment . Then he stood abruptly . McLaren followed suit . " Then , General McLaren , I believe we have nothing further to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " McLaren picked up his uniform cap and briefcase . " Okay , you do that . " " They will not be pleased . Perhaps our President will want to discuss the matter with your President . " So they were going to try going over his head on this one ? That was n't much of a surprise . But McLaren doubted they 'd get any further with Washington than they had with him . " Fine . I 'm sure they 'll find a great deal to discuss . In the meantime , your colleagues do n't have to be happy with my decision . They just have to live with it . " He returned Park 's salute and headed out to his staff car . He had an inspection to conduct . And with the mood he was in , he sure as hell hoped the commander of the 4th Battalion , 7th Cavalry had everything ready .  | ' Ilse lights were out all over Pyongyang , leaving the city wrapped in a darkness broken only by the stars reflecting off the Taedong River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towering apartment houses merged into simple patches of greater or lesser blackness  --  without feature , without clear line , without scale . Kim Jong-Il smiled bitterly as he stood looking out over the city from his office . I le knew that these periodic practice air raid alerts and blackouts had little military use . He 'd seen the lowlight videotapes made by the American bombers striking Libya in 1986 . Denying them the use of city lights as aiming points would n't have much effect . Still , the alerts served as an important instrument of political control . They demonstrated unity and discipline . They reminded the people of the sacrifices of the past and of the dangers as yet all around . After all , what significance could petty internal grievances have when compared to the threat of an aggressive , imperialist war machine ? Kim turned away from the windows , closed the heavy blackout drapes , and switched on his desk lamp . The small circle of light cast distorted shadows against the wood-paneled walls of his office  --  shadows he ignored . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time for action . The agent Scorpion 's work had borne fruit beyond all his initial expectations . The bloody scenes in Seoul 's streets had shattered the South 's governing coalition , and they were driving the American Congress out of lockstep with its client state . He had the wedge he 'd sought . Now he had to make use of it . Kim snapped open the sealed Defense Ministry folder sent over by special courier earlier that evening . It contained a thick sheaf of densely typed  | pers and annotated maps . The title page bore a simple , boldfaced Bend : Draft Operations Plan : RED PHOENIX Most Secret SEPTEMBER 24 ? H CORPS HQ , KAESONG , NORTH KOREA The rumble and clatter of tank treads made it impossible to speak . Lieutenant General Cho Hyun-Jae glanced nervously at the guest beside him on the reviewing stand . Then he swung his eyes back front and allowed himself to relax minutely . His guest did n't seem angered or bored by the procession of battle-ready armored fighting vehicles Cho had arranged . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hard , set lines around his mouth had softened somewhat , and Cho could see the momentary gleam of white teeth every time a T-62 thundered by the stand . It was more a battle drill than a parade . A battalion 's worth of buttonedup tanks pitched and rolled across the tom-up landscape at full throttle , spread out in platoon groups of four . The forty T - 62s were followed by wave after wave of tracked BMPs and wheeled BTR personnel carriers , some towing mortars and light antitank guns . ZSU-23-4 Shilkas rolled along with this second echelon , their quad 23mm antiaircraft guns elevated and ready to fire into the black , threatening clouds that covered the sky . Kim watched it all avidly , and Cho thanked the nonexistent gods that he 'd arranged this realistic display of a motorized rifle regiment 's combat power instead of the traditional , lumbering military parade . Its effect on the Dear Leader was well worth the precious fuel it consumed . As the last vehicles roared off the review ground and over a hill , Kim leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their fading engines . " Excellent , General . A most impressive display . Your men typify the five combat readiness guidelines enunciated by my father : tenacious revolutionary spirit ; miraculous and elaborate tactics ; strong physique ; paint-blank shooting ; and ironbound regulations . " Cho bowed his head , acknowledging the compliment . " Thank you , Dear Leader . I shall relay your approval to my troops . " Kim nodded and half-turned to stare out again across the tread-tom ground . The silence seemed to stretch forever . Then , abruptly , without looking directly at Cho , he said , " Let 's take a walk together , General . We have much to discuss , you and I. " For an awful moment the tall , broad-shouldered North Korean corps  | commander felt his stomach twist in on itself , but he forced himself to appear calm and unruffled . Logically he should have nothing to fear from this man . His military record was distinguished , he kept his personal life carefully uncluttered of any suspicious bourgeois vices , and he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pro-Soviet faction of the General Staff and the Politburo  --  a faction the younger Kim headed . Still , Cho knew fear in the presence of this man who had the power to wipe away careers , lives , with the stroke of a pen or a raised voice . Kim was not always logical . He followed Kim out onto the open ground . The two men walked for several minutes without speaking , paced by a small cluster of uniformed aides and a phalanx of Kim 's heavily armed plainclothes bodyguards , all of whom stayed well out of earshot . At last Kim stopped , his eyes fixed on the muddy remains of a small , grassy hillock that had been crushed flat by Cho 's tanks . " Such power , " he halt-whispered to himself . Then he swung round to face Cho squarely . " Such power , General . Tell me , as commander of our Second Corps , you most directly confront our enemies , true ? " " Indeed , Dear Leader . " Kim stepped delicately over a patch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose to our Revolution ? " " Of course . " What was all this about ? It reminded Cho of the political instruction classes of his school days . " Your wife is well ? She finds your new apartment in Changwang Street to her liking ? " Cho looked at the shorter man in surprise . Why the sudden change of subject ? " Yes , Dear Leader . But then she 's always been fond of Pyongyang . She 's a city girl at heart . " Kim smiled , showing his teeth . " Good . Good . " He clasped his hands behind his back . " Tell me what you think of Red Phoenix , Comrade General . " Cho shrugged . " I helped draft the plan during my last tour on the General Staff , Dear Leader . It was a good plan then and it 's a good plan now . In fact , I believe that it offers our best hope for a successful liberation of the South . " He frowned as one of Kim 's boots splashed mud across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice was flat , uninterested . " This plan calls for a surprise attack across the so-called DMZ  --  an attack launched right out of our barracks . Why ? " " Surprise is the handmaiden of victory , " the general quoted . " The South has larger reserves than we do . A sudden , unexpected attack would deny them the time needed to mobilize those reserves . It would also prevent the Americans from shipping in their own reinforcements . "  | Kimn nodded his understanding . They walked quietly across the tom-up ( held for several minutes more before he asked in a carefully casual tone , " How soon could you be ready to launch Red Phoenix ? Two weeks ? A month ? " A strange question . So strange that Cho answered honestly , without thinking of possible consequences . He shook his head . " Impossible . We could n't possibly be ready for several months at least . " Kim pounced on that . " Why not ? Have you and your fellow generals been shirking ? Where is all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The look in the smaller man 's eyes made Cho picture an ice-cold bayonet poised at his vitals . It was a time to be cautious . " We are ready for most contingencies , Dear Leader . You have my word on that . But Red Phoenix has not been our official strategy . Launching it successfully would require moving most of our own second echelon troops closer to the front  --  all without the fascists noticing . That takes time . There are only so many railroads and only so many hours in the day that imperialist spy satellites are n't overhead watching . " The general gestured at the muddy , ripped-up ground around them . " And that is the other reason , Dear Leader . An armored assault into the South now would quickly bog down in the rice paddies . We would n't have the mobility required to carry it out successfully . Red Phoenix calls for a winter war  --  a war when the fields are frozen and can support our tanks . " He stopped talking , conscious that his palms were wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mounding dirt and torn grass behind it . Then he nodded sharply . " Very well , General . I accept your explanation . " Cho bowed . Kim looked carefully at him for several heartbeats and seemed to come to some sort of decision . " What I am about to tell you , General , is a matter of the highest State security . You are not to reveal anything to anyone without my express permission . Understood ? " Wordlessly Cho nodded . " Should you disobey that instruction , you will suffer . And your suffering will extend to all those who bear your name . Is that clear ? " Cho shivered . Now he understood Kim 's questions about his wife . " Yes , Dear Leader . " " Excellent . " The shorter man turned away from him while still speaking . " General Cho , I am authorizing you to begin the initial preparations for Red Phoenix . " For a moment the general stared at Kim , transfixed by a flood of contradictory emotions  --  shocked by Kim 's bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the People 's Army being unleashed on its enemies after  | nearly forty years of seemingly endless waiting , and dismayed by the prospect of possible defeat . He carefully studied the man waiting for his answer , swallowed hard , and found his voice . " I shall obey your orders willingly , Dear Leader . But there are ... practical difficulties . I am ? " Kim cut him off with an impatient gesture . " Yes , yes , Cho . I see them far more clearly than you think I do . As a corps commander , you ca n't order the second echelon troops forward to a full war footing without the General Staff 's approval . Or make any of the other needed preparations for that matter . " Kiin reached into his tunic and pulled out a folded sheet of paper . He handed it to Cho . " Within forty-eight hours the General Staff will unanimously approve the order contained on that piece of paper . It declares that the recent unrest in the South constitutes a possible security threat to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troop transfers necessary to meet that threat . I have a similar order for your counterpart at Fifth Corps . " Kim smiled ironically . " You will , of course , ensure that these defensive ' troop movements mirror the dispositions needed to launch Red Phoenix . " ( ; ho could n't think of anything to say . Launch Red Phoenix ? Prepare for war against the South and against the United States without the formal approval of the Great Leader , the Administration Council , the Central ( : onminittee ? This was unthinkable . Unbelievable . Unbidden , another word crept into his mind daring . Kim Jong-Il seemed to read his thoughts . " You find my orders surprising ? Dangerous , perhaps ? " " No , ) ear Leader . It just seems so ... " Adventuristic ? " Kim finished for him . " Perhaps . But why is that bad , my dear ( : ho ? Old men fear adventures . We are not old men , are we ? " Cho shook his head . Kim smiled . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the general 's eyes . " Believe me , Cho . There is an opportunity rising in the South  --  an opportunity for the reunification of our sacred homeland . " Kim clenched a fist . " It must not be wasted . It will not be wasted . " Cho could hear the iron determination in the man 's voice . Kim 's voice became soft and earnest . " General , forces are at work ? military , political , economic factors  --  that make it imperative that we strike as soon as possible . The imperialists are withdrawing , and until the puppets in the south realign themselves , they will be vulnerable . " He paused . " Also , comrade , I must tell you , in strict secrecy , that even our socialist allies are not to be entirely trusted . Southern gold is making inroads in both Russia and China , and as they slide closer to the South , they lose the revolutionary spirit . We must move now , while they still have the will to support our cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he leaned forward  | again and said , " Ride with me , Cho , and in six months ' time you will be a colonel general commanding the First Shock Army . Your future will be assured . You will be a hero of the fatherland . " The man 's dark eyes flashed . " Reject me and you will fall unnoticed in the mud . " ( ; ho stared into Kim 's eyes . Into the eyes of the sons of the Great Leader . Into the eyes of the heir to the man who had replaced God in North Korea . He had no choice . Wanted no choice . Lieutenant General Cho Ilyun-Jae came to attention and saluted . A thin-lipped smile spread slowly across Kim Jong-Il 's face . He had his general . Red Phoenix was underway .  | ( ' aptain Matuchek was obviously not in a good mood . " ( ioddamnit , Little . Next time I ask you a question during a map exercise I do n't want a friggin ' military history lecture . " Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head hurt . Matuchek carried on . " I wanted to know where you would have placed your machine gun teams to support an assault up Hill five seventy-two . I do n't give a flying frazzoo about limey Lord Wellington and his patented , Waterloo-style , rear-slope defense . Do you read me , mister ? " Kevin nodded again , cautiously , half-afraid that the top half of his brain would fall right out on his company commander 's desk . " Yes , sir . Loud and clear , sir . " " Okay , consider yourself chewed out . I 'll take your word that it wo n't happen again . " Matuchek rolled his chair back a few inches and opened a desk drawer . He pulled out a file folder and slid it across to Kevin . " Anyway , you wo n't he participating in the next exercise . You and your platoon are rotating to Malibu West for a week , starting at oh four hundred hours tomorrow . " Kevin picked up the folder . Malibu ? What the hell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant . You are n't going to see any bikini-clad surfer chicks up at Malibu West . That 's the name we use for Hill six forty . " He grinned a little wider . " You 'll be in scenic bunker accommodations along the DMZ , just a couple of klicks north of the lovely little village of Korangp'o . " " Just us , sir ? I mean , what about the rest of the company ? " Kevin tried hard to keep his head perfectly still as he talked . " Oh , we 'll be right behind you . In position along the MLR , the Main Line of Resistance . You 're pulling outpost duty , Lieutenant . You know , first  | to fight and first to fall . " Matuchek laced the fingers of his hands together on top of his desk and looked slightly smug . " I 'll expect to see your platoon on trucks heading out the camp gate at oh two hundred tomorrow . Sergeant Pierce will know what kind of equipment and supplies to take . " At 0200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night road march and his first one at that . But two weeks with the 2nd Infantry Division had taught Kevin not to complain  --  at least not out loud . Matuchek was a good company commander , but he had a hair-trigger temper and it seemed that right now was not a good time to reveal any more gaps in his knowledge or experience . Kevin had n't been able to get the hang of handling the captain yet . Everything that he did seemed to set Matuchek off . The man definitely was n't the nurturing type . One of the other platoon leaders had told him not to worry too much about it . There was a rumor going around that the captain and his wife back in the States were having " marital difficulties " and that was the real source of Matuchek 's discontent . It was easy enough to believe that the rumor was the straight scoop . Korea was classed as a hardship post  --  no wives or families allowed . And any two people could grow far apart over twelve months . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position as the focal point for Matuchek 's temper any easier . " Okay , Little . That 's all for now . Study that folder . You 'll find a platoon deployment drawn up by the officer you replaced . Do n't bother to change it . He knew what he was doing . Dismissed . " Matuchek jerked a thumb toward his office door . Kevin took the hint and left in search of his platoon sergeant . Walking across the compound to find Sergeant Pierce was a chore . The ground would n't stay still , it just kept rolling up and down , and the bright morning sun sent his shadow lurching ahead of him . He frowned at no one in particular . Somehow he was going to have to find a way to get off Matuchek 's shit list . The trouble was he was n't quite sure just how to go about doing that . Take the map exercise the grouchy bastard was pissed off about for example . Kevin and the other A Company platoon leaders had been simulating an attack to recapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Moving little cardboard counters back and forth on a map to show deployments and assault formations . Kevin had been demonstrating how he would position his platoon 's infantry squads and weapons teams to support the attack when Matuchek had suddenly blown up and ripped him up one side and down the other . All because he 'd made an offhand comment about how machine gun support was n't going to do much ii(x)d because most of the Aggressor " defense force would logically be dug in behind the hill  --  protected from direct line-of-sight support fire . It had made  | sense then . And it made sense now . But maybe he should n't have tried to show off by pointing out that deploying on . a reverse slope was a tactic going all the way back to Wellington 's beating the French at Waterloo . It had seemed like the right thing to say at the time . Kevin shook his head slowly and then wished he had n't . The ground did n't stop moving when his eyes did . He 'd just have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matuchek obviously was n't much of a scholar . I le 'd also have to take it easy next time the other company officers invited him into town with them . Sirroci , Owens , and O'Farrell had called it his " initiation " to South Korea , and they must have hit every bar in Tongduch'on before lurching back to camp . He thought he could remember eating dinner in some tiny cafe , but he could n't remember exactly what he 'd eaten . Judging from the raw , burning feeling in his stomach and throat , it must have been liberally laced with garlic and some really hot red peppers . Of course , from what he 'd seen of Korean cuisine so far , that could describe just about anything . With an effort he tried to stop concentrating on his hangover and to start thinking about just where his platoon sergeant might be closeted at this time in the morning . Kevin found Sergeant Pierce in the platoon armory supervising a weaponscleaning detail . Ten men in work fatigues were busy scrubbing away at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those boring , routine , and absolutely necessary jobs that occupy most of a modern soldier 's time . To keep an M16 up and firing took a liberal amount of 10-weight sewing machine oil and a daily cleaning . Kevin 's ROTC instructors had gone to great lengths to make sure that he knew that a jammed M16 could be just as fatal for its owner as a tank that would n't run . That was something Sergeant Pierce obviously agreed with wholeheartedly , and he spent a lot of time making sure that 2nd Platoon 's weapons were clean and ready for action . Kevin poked his head into the small , cramped room and motioned the sergeant outside to give him a quick rundown on their new orders . " Malibu West , sir ? " Pierce was considerate ; he kept his voice below its normal booming level . " That 's right , Sergeant . And the captain wants us up and out of here by oh two hundred tomorrow . " Kevin knew the sergeant and he were going to be damned busy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five men , their personal gear , two M60 light machine guns , three Dragon antitank guided missile launchers , and a week 's worth of supplies up to the DMZ were incredibly complicated . Among other things he had to arrange transportation for his platoon , get the latest artillery support plan , set up his communications  --  everything , in fact , down to making sure the  | platoon 's mail would get delivered . Just thinking about it threatened to turn his headache into a real bastard of a migraine . Pierce eyed him closely . " Look , Lieutenant , I 'll start pulling things together for the move . That 's all SOP anyway . " Yeah , thank God for SOP  --  standard operating procedures . Anything the Army had to do more than three times was written down as SOP He could find the information he needed in the Army 's bible for troop movements , Army Manual FM 55-30 , catchily titled " Army Motor Transport Operations . " There were always shortcuts that experienced officers could use that were n't covered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to go before he could consider himself experienced . " You do n't need to worry about a thing , sir . The boys have been up to Malibu West so often they could probably load everything up in their sleep , " Pierce said . " Right , Sergeant . " Kevin cleared his throat . " You go ahead and get started then . I 'll tell Lieutenant Rhee about our new orders and meet you back at the barracks to go over the movement ops order . " Pierce saluted and left whistling . Kevin watched him leave , envying the man 's seeming ability to take anything that happened in stride . He turned on his heel and headed for the two-story , whitewashed BOQ to find his South Korean counterpart , Lieutenant Rhee . Under the Combined Forces structure set up back in 1978 , virtually every American line and staff officer had a South Korean counterpart assigned to handle liaison with the ROK Army . It was a step that had been taken partly for political reasons  --  to smooth over growing South Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was also a very practical concept . In a situation where there were more than fifteen South Korean soldiers for every American , the counterpart system helped make sure that language and cultural barriers did n't impede military efficiency as much as they might have . When Kevin had arrived at Camp Howze , Rhee had been off attending some kind of staff course , so he 'd only met the Korean lieutenant a couple of times . But they 'd gotten along fairly well , and Rhee spoke perfect English . So perfect in fact that Kevin felt embarrassed that he 'd only been able to pick up a few sentences of phrasebook Korean . Second Lieutenant Rhee Han-Gil , wearing a crisp , newly pressed uniform , opened the door to his room at Kevin 's first knock and waved him in . Except for a cigarette smoldering in an ashtray on the desk , the room looked ready for an inspection by the entire General Staff . Every book was perfectly aligned , Rhee 's clothes hung in regulation order , and the sheets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could bounce even a paper won  --  the Korean currency  --  off it . The South Korean lieutenant seemed just  | as ready for an inspection . He was shorter than Kevin and stocky , but he had a lean , sharp-featured face . " What can I do for you , Lieutenant Little ? " Like most Koreans , Rhee was a stickler for titles . The easygoing , informal way most Americans spoke to each other was completely alien to people raised in a culture steeped in the need to show respect for authority . Rhee would have been shocked if Kevin started calling him by his first name . " We 've got movement orders  --  short-notice ones . " Kevin tried not to let his dislike for Captain Matuchek show . " We 're being sent up to some place called Malibu West for a week . " " Ah , yes , Malibu West . I have been there before . I 'm afraid that it is not nearly so glamorous as the real Malibu in California must be . " Rhee smiled slightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malibu anyway . " Yeah . Well , we 're moving out early tomorrow morning , so I thought I 'd better let you know . You 'll need to be packed and ready to go by oh two hundred . " The Korean pointed to a duffel bag standing in the corner . " Thank you , hut there is no need . I am quite ready . But I can make use of the time to coordinate with the units holding the other outposts on our flanks . " " l low the hell . . . did Matuchek already tell you we were moving up to the Z ? " Kevin asked , irritated that the captain might be trying to make him look like an ill-informed idiot . Rhee looked apologetic . " Oh , no . The captain did n't tell me anything . It 's just that the communists caught my country sleeping once before . We shall never be caught that way again . We 're trained to be ready for any eventuality . " " Well , you 're way ahead of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , realizing it was probably time to swallow a little more pride . " Look , if you 've been up to this place before , maybe you can give me some advice on what to take up there . I mean , besides the usual , my combat gear , rifle , stuff like that . " Rhee nodded . " Of course , I 'd be honored to assist you in any way I can . " He thought for a moment . " First , I should take a set of extra blankets if I were you . The nights are growing colder and we wo n't have any heat up at the outpost . " Kevin was surprised . " What ? Well , hell , why do n't we take a couple of camp stoves with us then ? " Christ , you 'd have thought some bright Army officer before him would have figured that one out . Rhee did n't look impressed . " Unfortunately , " he said , " camp stoves produce smoke . And the communists have the unpleasant habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell . " Mortars ? Oh , brother , this was getting worse and worse . A posting to West Germany would have been so much better . The Russians and their East  | ( lcrinan puppets might be a dour lot , but at least they did n't lob mortar shells over the inter-German border on a whim . Kevin shook his head . " Okay , no camp stoves . Blankets instead . Anything else unusual I should bring ? " Rhee flexed his fingers . " Well , you might bring along a deck of cards . " He twisted his Korean Military Academy class ring back and forth . A good slime of your American five-card stud always helps to pass the time . " So , Mr. Perfect enjoyed a game of poker , did he ? Kevin concealed his surprise . He 'd been in the country long enough to learn that the South Koreans were a proud people . It would n't do to offend or shame Rhee by making a big deal out of the fact that he liked to play cards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surplus of friends over here . He grinned . " Okay , you 're on . I 'll see you on the parade ground at oh one thirty tomorrow . " Rhee smiled back . ' As you American say , it 's a date . " " And Lieutenant , " he said as Kevin moved to the door , " I thought your point about the machine guns in today 's exercise was very interesting . " " Yeah , well , thanks . But I 'm afraid the captain did n't exactly think so . " Rhee did n't exactly smile either , but Kevin could swear he saw an eyebrow twitch upward . " The captain is , of course , a good soldier . Is there anything so perfect , however , that it can not be improved ? " Kevin sketched a rough salute and stepped out of Rhee 's quarters in a happier mood . Things might finally be looking up , and even his hangover seemed to be fading . So his Korean counterpart liked to play cards . Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week , he might as well make the best of It . Colonels , captains , and majors always seemed to be able to read the least hit of indecision on his face in military matters , but card games were something else altogether . He could hold his own there . Rhee could n't possibly know that playing poker had supplied him with spending money all the way through college . He headed back to the platoon barracks . Sergeant Pierce might be perfectly able to handle all the arrangements for the move on his own , but he 'd better get some idea of just what was involved . It would beat sitting on his behind in his quarters , moping around . He stopped in his tracks for a second . My God , maybe he was actually getting used to this place . Kevin remembered that optimistic thought sourly as he watched his platoon assemble on the floodlit parade ground early the next morning . The sun would n't be up for several more hours yet , and a cold north wind made the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue jacket tighter around him , trying to stay warm , and did his best to look alert as Sergeant Pierce called the roll .  | The platoon had already loaded their gear on the row of canvas-sided Army trucks parked behind him . Now the men were lined up , shivering at ease , as Pierce took a last check  --  making sure that nobody got left behind , snug in a warm bunk . " Walton ? " Pierce was n't shouting , but his voice carried across the parade ground . " Here . " " Wright ? " Silence . Pierce waited a couple of seconds and tried again , " Wright ? Look you dumb bastard , I saw you loading a truck not more than two minutes ago . So answer up . " " Yeah , Ah 'm here , Sarge . Guess Ah must 've fallen asleep . It 's just so cozy here in Ko-rea . " The other men chuckled softly . PFC Wright 's deep Arkansas twang and deadpan delivery made him the platoon comic . Kevin waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hut he did n't . Instead , Pierce just chuckled himself and said , " Okay , Funnyman . You think it 's so warm ? Then I guess I wo n't hear any complaints from you when you pull sentry duty tomorrow night . " That brought a laugh from the rest of the platoon . " Way to go , Johnny , " called someone from the ranks to Wright . " Thanks for volunteering . We 'll he thinking of you while we 're freezing in our sleeping bags . " " Aww , Sarge , " Wright tried again . " You know Ah got me a delicate type of chest condition . Walking a beat could send mah poor little soul right up to heaven . " But fierce was waiting for that one . " Well , PFC , be sure to give my regards to St. Peter then . I 'll let him know you 're on the way . " Even Wright broke up laughing . Kevin felt himself smiling in the darkness and tried to stop . Ile had to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear Rhee , standing beside him , laughing as hard as all the rest . " Okay , troops . Settle down , " Pierce said . " The sooner we get this roll call finished , the sooner we can get in out of this damned wind . " That shut them up . " Yates ? " " Here . " " Zelinsky ? " " Here , Sergeant . " Pierce shoved his clipboard back under his arm . " Tenshun ! " The platoon snapped to attention . Pierce turned to Kevin . " Platoon present and accounted for , sir ! " He saluted . Kevin stepped out of the shadows and returned the salute . He took a line out of the movies . " Very good , Sergeant . Load ' em up . " The sergeant wheeled back to face the platoon . " You heard the lieuten-  | nt . Let 's go . Everybody on the trucks ! " The men broke ranks and started clambering into the canvas-sided trucks , one eleven-man squad per vehicle . Kevin pulled himself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the one just behind him , and Pierce took the last truck in the convoy . The five trucks wheeled off the parade ground and roared out through the main gate . Once on the highway running past the camp , they turned north and lumbered toward the DMZ . Camp Howze was only about fifteen kilometers behind the DMZ but the trip to the assembly point took nearly two hours . Every kilometer or so they were stopped at fully manned checkpoints , complete with barricades , barbed wire , and machine guns . And at every checkpoint their papers were scrutinized by submachine gun  --  toting South Korean security troops . Kevin did n't know what made him more nervous , the intense security or the possibility that it was necessary . At last they turned off the main highway onto a tree-lined dirt road winding up a narrow valley . The corporal driving the lead truck slowed down to a crawl , and the ear-splitting engine noise fell away to a low , dull roar . A helmeted soldier appeared in the headlight 's beams , waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " There 's our ground guide . " Reaching forward , he doused the truck 's headlights , turning on the dim red blackout lights . Startled , Kevin turned to ask him just what he thought he was doing . The man drove and kept his eyes on his guide . " Regulations , sir . We 're within five klicks of the Z here and we 're not supposed to make it any easier for the North Koreans to know what we 're up to . " Kevin had to admit that made some sense . He sat back and tried to act nonchalant as they drove slowly up the valley . The assembly point was a small clearing just behind the trenches and bunkers of the main line of resistance , the MLR . They were ten minutes behind schedule . Kevin clambered out of the truck cab and walked toward the lone figure who had guided them . Urged on by Sergeant Pierce 's low , hoarse voice , his men clambered out of the trucks and formed up in a column of twos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low clouds covered most of the night sky . The red beam came up and centered on his face . " Second Platoon from Alpha ? " Kevin nodded , then realized the man probably could n't see him all that clearly . " Yeah . You the guide to Malibu West ? " " Sergeant Hourigan , sir . Third Platoon , Bravo Company . Lieutenant Miller 's waiting back up at the outpost . If you 're ready , sir , we should hit the trail . Sunup 's in a little over an hour and a half , and we 've got some hard walking to do by then . "  | " Okay . " Kevin half-turned toward the column behind him . " Sergeant Pierce ? " " Here , sir . Platoon 's assembled and ready to move . " Kevin turned back to their guide . " Okay , Hourigan . Let 's do it . " Hourigan lead them out through an opening in the rolls of barbed wire strung along the MLR . The ground was rough and uneven , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tall patch of brush had been cut down or uprooted to provide clear fields of fire for the troops stationed behind them . i lourigan stopped suddenly , then moved over to the left a few yards . Kevin followed him . The sergeant reached over and tapped him on the shoulder . " See them white stakes up ahead , Lieutenant ? " Kevin nodded . " Well , there 's a pair every few yards . Stay between ' em unless you want to get blown to bits . We 're going through the main minefield now . " The column pushed on , moving slower now that they were in the minefield . Kevin kept going , trying to keep pace with Hourigan . He brushed away sweat that was beginning to trickle into his eyes . Jesus , he had n't carried a fifty-pound pack since basic . He could feel his heart pounding . In the still night air every scuffed rock , patch of dried grass , or broken twig made a noise he could swear would carry for miles . At last they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail that got steeper and steeper . They began passing through piles of boulders lying half-buried on the slope . Kevin could feel the straps of his pack starting to cut into his shoulders as they climbed . God , this was a damned high hill . It had n't looked this bad on the map . A voice broke through the darkness . " Halt . " It was accompanied by the sound of a machine gun 's being cocked . Shit . The sentry called , " Advance and be recognized . " The party walked forward in the pitch-blackness . After a dozen steps they heard , " That 's far enough . Marbles-Galore . " The sergeant stopped . " It 's Hourigan , you dumb son of a bitch . " " I do n't give a shit . Give the countersign or you 're a deader . " " Zebra-Cardinal . " " Okay , Come ahead . " They could hear the safety being snapped back on . Kevin ran a hand across his face and wiped it across the front of his jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The platoon stumbled over the crest of Hill 640 and into the middle of Malibu West . Another column was there , waiting to go down . A figure wearing black plastic bars stepped out from the head of the other column . " Little ? I 'm Miller . Glad to see you 're here . Look , let 's go into the command post and I 'll get you settled in before I head down after my troops . Hourigan and your platoon sergeant can get your men squared away . "  | Kevin still could n't quite make out the man 's face in the darkness , but he could tell that it was getting lighter . He followed Miller down a couple of steps into a low , lamp-lit bunker . The command post , or CP , was scarcely five feet high , made of green sandbags with a beamed ceiling . Inside , it was barely big enough for the two cots , a table , telephone , and backup radio . And it stank . A mixture of unwashed bodies , damp mustiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to breathe in too deeply . Miller laughed . " I know . It 's pretty bad , is n't it ? Our laundry and bathing facilities are n't exactly first class up here . Do n't worry , you 'll get used to it . " The other lieutenant had dark shadows under his eyes . He motioned Kevin over to a low table crowded with a map and a communications setup . " Okay , here are your fire concentrations . " Kevin could see a sheaf of plastic overlays with colored-pencil markings showing preregistered artillery firing points and code numbers . Miller continued on down the table . " Your radio , field phones , soundpowered phones to your squad leaders and the other outposts nearby , one to your company CP back on the MLR , and the artillery direct line . " Kevin nodded his understanding . " Any questions ? " Kevin shook his head , then thought better of it . " Just one . Has it been hectic up here lately ? " " Nah . Pretty damned quiet  --  for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pray until the all-clear comes . ' " Miller stood up , stooped low to avoid the roof . " Okay . That 's it then . Good luck and I 'll see you back at the camp . " He held out his hand . Kevin shook it , suddenly realizing that Miller could n't wait to get out of Malibu West . Well , he could n't blame him for that . Miller nodded and ducked back out the door up into the cleaner air outside . Kevin sat down heavily onto one of the bunks . Great , he had a whole week in this combination rattrap and outhouse to look forward to . He dropped his pack off onto the ground by his feet . At least that felt better . Then he remembered that he 'd better report the platoon in to Captain Matuchek back in position along the main line . He stepped over to pick up the phone to the company CP . Now , just where the hell was that list of code names he was supposed to use ? Kevin fished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a small pad of radio codes . He lifted the field phone 's receiver . " Alfa Echo Five Six . Alfa Echo Five Six . This is Alfa Echo Five Two . " " Go ahead , Echo Five Two . This is Echo Five Six . " The line was clear of  | static . Good , he could call for help without much trouble if he needed it . That was reassuring . " Echo Five Six , Echo Five Two is in position . Say again , Echo Five Two is in position . " " Roger , Two . You 're in position . Out . " Kevin put the phone back down on the table and rubbed his eyes . He had n't gotten any sleep the night before , and he knew he 'd have to stay awake at least until past dawn to make a daylight inspection of the position . Ile looked at his watch : 0535 . The sun should be up in twenty minutes or so . I le could see the sky outside growing grayer . Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think it 's light enough to take a quick walk around now , Lieutenant . " Kevin sat up sharply . It was growing orange outside now . The sun must be coming up over the horizon . Oh , crap . He 'd fallen asleep , just nodded right off on his first tour of duty up at the DMZ . He blinked and staggered to his feet , barely stopping himself from trying to stand full upright under the CP 's low roof . I lc followed Pierce out into a connecting trench dug from the CP out to the edge of the hill . It tied into the main trench running completely around the outpost . Rhee joined them there for the inspection of their home for the next week . Malibu West was laid out in a rough oval with a six-foot-deep trench connecting twelve reinforced log bunkers large enough to shelter four men during an enemy air or artillery attack . Each bunker was separated by about fifteen yards of trench . Firing steps along the trench made it possible for troops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of barbed wire and a minefield completed the defenses . As an outpost , Malibu West and its defenders were expected to fight pretty much on their own , though with liberal artillery support . Malibu and the other strongpoints like it scattered along the DMZ were intended to make an enemy assault force deploy for an attack before it reached the main allied line . It was hoped they would delay an assault long enough to allow the UN command to bring American and South Korean air and artillery power into play and to move reserves to the right places . In essence , the men holding the outposts were expected to buy time with their lives . " I 've put our two MG 's in the far left and far right bunkers on the forward slope . That should give us good coverage to the front . And we 've inherited another MG with the position . Lieutenant Miller had it set up to cover the rear slope , and I figured that was a pretty good place for it so I left it there . " Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawned . Damn , he 'd have to start waking up . " Any comments , Lieutenant Rhee ? " The South Korean looked wide-awake . Naturally . " No . It sounds like a  | reasonable deployment to me . But what about our Dragon teams ? " That was a good question . The Dragon teams with their wire-guided missiles were the 2nd Platoon 's best defense against enemy tanks and APCs . " I 've got ' em spread out along the forward slope . If the balloon goes up and NK tanks start getting around behind us , we may have to move ' em . But they 've got good fields of fire where they are right now . " Kevin nodded . " All right , Sergeant . Good work . " He worked his tongue around inside his mouth , trying to clear out the gritty taste he 'd acquired during his short , unintentional nap . He looked at Rhee . " I understand there 's a South Korean platoon holding the next outpost over from us . Why do n't you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let them know we 're here . Okay ? " Rhee smiled and sketched a salute . " No problem , Lieutenant . " " Great . Oh , and then get some sleep . I thought we 'd pull three watches until we get settled in . I 'll take the first , Sergeant Pierce here can take the second , and you 'll take the third . Sound all right to you ? " Rhee smiled even more broadly . " Certainly , Lieutenant . I 'm always glad to hear that I 'll get some uninterrupted sleep . " He saluted again and moved back down the trench toward the CP . Kevin yawned again and stretched . He 'd have to get Zelinsky to make some coffee . In the meantime he could get a look at the terrain around Malibu . He 'd studied the map , but you could n't always trust maps . There was that time he 'd gotten lost on a night training march near Fort Lewis . . . it had just been damn lucky that he 'd found a gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head to clear the memory . He 'd learned his lesson that time . Never trust maps . He clambered up onto the firing step and lifted his binoculars . Let 's see . Hill 640 , Malibu West , fell sharply away down a rocky slope into a narrow , brush-filled valley . There were gullies running through the valley and up toward a ridgeline to the north . He could just make out what might be some camouflaged bunkers on that ridge . A hand grabbed his combat webbing and yanked him down off the firing step . " What the fuck ? " Kevin wheeled in fury as Pierce let go of his webbing . " Sorry , sir . " Pierce did n't sound very sorry . " But part of what they pay me for is to make sure that my lieutenants do n't get shot on their first day up at the Z. " " And what does that have to do with grabbing me from behind just now ? " Kevin was breathing hard . He 'd been startled . Christ , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man must move like a ghost . " Snipers , Lieutenant . The North Koreans take a special pride in potting people staring at ' em with shiny binoculars . You want to look around up at  | the Z , you use the ' scopes . " Pierce jerked a thumb toward a periscope that could be raised above the trench parapet . " Oh , bullshit . I know that the North Koreans are lunatics , but they ca n't just go around shooting people . There is an armistice on , you know . " " You know it and I know it , Lieutenant . But I ai n't too sure the gooks know it or give a damn . " Pierce had his voice pitched low . " Look , sir . This is n't peacetime up here . This is damn close to the real thing . Back when I was just a green PFC , before Vietnam , I was stationed at a place pretty much like this . " He paused . " So things have n't changed much in more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impatient . It was starting to warm up , the sun was in his eyes , and he wanted some coffee . " Well , sir , this rear-area general came up for an inspection one day . Now , the lieutenant gave him a pretty good tour of the bunkers , trenches , and all , but this general wanted to see the commies for himself . And he would n't hear of using anything like that ' scope over there . So he just jumped up on the firing step and would n't listen to the lieutenant asking him to get down . Ile did n't listen until some commie sniper put a round through his head . " Pierce laid a finger on the bridge of his nose , right between his eyes . " Right there , Lieutenant . Knocked that dumbshit general off the firing step and blew what little brains he had out through the back of his head . " " Christ ! " Kevin was shocked . " How come I never read anything about that ? " " 1 Icll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose a general , I guess . " " Well , what happened to your lieutenant ? " " They were n't too happy with him . Was n't his fault , so they could n't send him to Leavenworth , but they did shove his ass out of the Army in a godawful hurry . " Kevin thought about that for a moment and then smiled ruefully . " Okay , Sergeant . You 've made your point . You wo n't lose this dumbshit lieutenant the same way . " Pierce grinned back at him , " That 's the spirit , Lieutenant . It 's just a question of experience . And there 's one thing you can say for the Z  --  you get experienced real quick . " OCTOBER 1 ? MALIBU WEST , ALONG THE DMZ After six days Kevin had had enough of Malibu West . Six days of solid boredom . Of not being able to move freely during daylight . Of lousy food and not enough sleep . Six days that were too hot and six nights that were too cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games with Rhee , Pierce , and a couple of the other noncoms . Playing cards with his NCOs might not be regulation , but it helped pass the time . Table stakes were low because it would n't do to have officers winning too much money from their subordinates . Still , he 'd won more than he 'd lost . And it had been nice to see a look of genuine respect on Sergeant Pierce 's face for once . But that had been it . Other than a series of meaningless , routine daily reports and a single , quick inspection by Captain Matuchek , who 'd seemed pleasantly surprised to find the outpost still intact , their tour at Malibu West had been about as exciting as guarding a convent somewhere in the Midwest . That made the call even more shocking when it came . " Sir ! " The hand that was shaking him shook even harder . " Sir ! " Kevin groaned and tried to roll over . It was still dark out and he 'd been up past midnight filling out useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his radioman . " Captain 's on the phone , sir . Says it 's urgent . " Shit . Now what the hell did he want . Probably wanted to bitch about some goddamned form he 'd filled in wrong . Kevin threw the blankets off his cot and stumbled over to the phone . " Alfa Echo Five Six , this is Alfa Echo Five Two . Go ahead . " " Five Two , this is Five Six . Wait one . " Great , they woke him up and now they were going to make him wait . But the line came alive again in seconds , and something in Matuchek 's voice brought Kevin up straight . " Five Two , this is Five Six . Go to full alert . Say again , go to full alert . We have a general stand-to all along the Z. " Oh , Christ . Kevin could feel his heart starting to pound and he was having trouble catching his breath . " Six , this is Two . Is this a drill ? Over . " Matuchek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't fucking know . And right now I do n't fucking care ! Just get your men out on the firing line and clear the goddamned phone . Six out . " Kevin handed the phone back to Jones and looked around for his M16 , flak jacket , and helmet . They were in the corner of the CP , right where he 'd left them . Rhee was already up and buckling on his gear . Kevin turned back to Jones . " Okay , get Pierce in here . On the double . " I le took a deep breath , but he could n't seem to get enough air into his lungs . Shit , shit , calm down . He grabbed his flak jacket and started to put it on , then realized he had it backward . He flipped the bulky jacket around and slipped into it . Rhee handed him his helmet . " What 's up , Lieutenant ? " Pierce was in the door to the CP , rifle in hand and looking as awake as if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alert . All along the DMZ . I do n't know if it 's for real or  | not , but you 'd better get the men up and in position anyway . " Kevin grabbed his rifle and map case . Pierce backed out of the CP and vanished down the shadow-filled connecting trench , moving toward the nearest bunker . Rhee headed out the other door . Kevin followed him as far as the main trench , accompanied by Jones , lugging the platoon 's commo gear . The moon was up and nearly full , casting an eerie mix of orangish light and pitch-black shadows across the valley below . Gusts of a cold north wind stirred the brush back and forth and whined through the coils of barbed wire covering the approaches to Malibu West . Kevin fumbled with the focus on the periscope . Damn it . For all he could make out , the valley down there could be filled with a thousand enemy soldiers . Or it could be empty . The eleven troopers of 2nd Squad jogged past him , equipment rattling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clambered up onto firing steps . " Sir ! " Jones 's hoarse whisper pulled Kevin 's eyes away from the periscope and hack down into the trench . " Sergeant Pierce says everybody 's up and in position . Nothing else to report . " " ' icll Pierce to get back here pronto . And check with Company to see if they 've got anything more . " Pierce was there almost before he finished speaking . " We 're set , Lieutenant . One of the Dragon launchers is acting up a bit , but Ramos is working on it . Should have it up in a couple of minutes . " " Well , he goddamned well better . Christ , what if we get hit by tanks in the next couple of minutes ! " Kevin realized he was starting to sound like he 'd lost it and tried to calm down . He got down off the parapet and squatted in the trench next to Pierce . " Look , are we picking anything up on our motion sensors or starlight scopes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving or warm out there . " " Then this could all be just a false alarm . " Pierce shrugged . " Maybe . Maybe not . Could be a long night , though , whichever way it goes . " A shout from down the line brought them both to their feet . " Flares ! Flares to the east ! " Kevin whipped his periscope around to stare down to the right . There , about five miles away , he could see two magnesium flares swaying away south on their parachutes . He found himself praying under his breath . God , oh God , please do n't let this be real . Do n't let there be a war . Please , God . " Could be an attack down that way . " Pierce still sounded calm . " Might just be an infiltration attempt though . " He cupped a hand to an ear . " I do n't hear any shooting . " Rhee 's voice drifted down the line , high and excited . " Those flares are  | coming from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post on our right . " Kevin yelled back , " Well , get on the horn and ask them what the hell 's going on . " " Lieutenant ? " Pierce coughed lightly to catch his attention . " Next time you and Lieutenant Rhee want to have a conversation , you might not want to yell it all over creation . If there are gooks down there , I figure they probably know we 're awake and ready for ' em now . " Kevin felt his ears burning . Pierce was right and there was n't any way around it . He 'd make a stupid mistake . The kind that Major Donaldson had warned could get his men killed . He looked down at Corporal Jones . " Uh , pass the word to Lieutenant Rhee that he 's to report here after he 's talked to that Korean outpost . " They waited for several more minutes , but no more flares popped up to light the night sky , and everything stayed quiet . Rhee came jogging down the trench and jumped up beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over at Azure Dragon . It seems that one of their new conscripts got overexicted and fired off a pair of flares . He 'll be disciplined , of course . " Kevin knew that meant the poor little sod was probably getting the living crap beat out of him . And just at this moment , he did n't care a bit . Then Jones was grabbing for his elbow again . " Sir ! It 's the captain ! " Kevin picked up the phone with a feeling of dread . Was this it ? Was the balloon going up ? " Alfa Echo Five Six , this is Five Two . " " Alfa Echo Five Two , this is Alfa Echo Five Six . Stand down . I repeat , stand down . Resume normal schedule . That was a drill , Lieutenant , a real McLaren Special . " " Acknowledged , Five Six . " He tried to sound cool and collected , but he knew that Matuchek had to be able to hear the immense relief in his voice . lie could see Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation . " Well , Lieutenant . Are your britches full of brown organic matter ? " Matuchek did n't sound quite as pissed off as he usually did , despite the words . " Not quite , Five Six . Close , but not quite . " Pray God that Matuchek did n't ever find out just how close to the truth that was . " Well , Lieutenant . If that McLaren Special did n't fill ' em up , I guess we might make a soldier of you yet . See you back at camp tomorrow morning . Echo Five Six out . " Kevin hung up , feeling drained and shaky . But relieved , too . He 'd screwed tip , but it had n't been for real . And he still had time to learn .  | " Comrade General . COMRADE GENERAL ! " Lieutenant General Cho Hyun-Jae opened his eyes . The lights were on , revealing Colonel Chung , his aide , bending over the bed . He came fully awake . " What is it , Chung ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was important enough to wake him , it was important enough to get dressed for . " Sir , the enemy has just gone on alert . We 've seen movement into enlplal CnlentS . .. " ( ; ho headed out the door , buttoning his tunic as he ran , with the colonel jogging along behind . The bunker had been constructed so that his quarters were only moments away from the II Corps operations center . The door was open . Cho slowed down , took a deep breath , and entered an organized pandemonium . Officers and enlisted men were streaming into the room , taking positions at map boards , teletypes , and desks . A huge map occupied one side of the room , detailing the sector of the front around Kaesong , his responsibility . General Chyong Dal-Joong , his second-incommand , stood nearby discussing some point on it with the staff . He saw Cho come into the room and saluted . The rest scattered to their stations . " Report , General . Another drill ? " Cho finished buttoning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to show enemy units on the big map . " Probably , sir . We 've seen no movement behind the front line , but all of the imperialist troops have manned their combat positions . It would not be an auspicious time to start the liberation . " The left side of Chyong 's mouth creased upward in a lopsided smile . Cho idly wondered how long it would be before his second-in-command 's  | sense of humor landed him in a State Political Security Department detention camp . He yawned . " I think they know when I am up late and do this just to ruin my sleep . Major Ko ! " He beckoned the slim , narrow-faced intelligence officer over to him . " Major , your observations , please . " " Yes , sir . I believe that this is an exercise . The enemy rotates the troops manning the perimeter on a regular weekly cycle . About once every two weeks he holds an alert . The alert is always in the early morning , and late in the week . Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place are ordered to stand to . No additional units are staged forward . That is what has happened this time . " " As far as we know , " Cho corrected . Ko looked a little crestfallen . " Yes , sir . As far as we know . " Cho quoted , " ' Revolution in military thought is built on a base of knowledge , not assumptions . ' " " Yes , sir . " Ko bowed sharply , accepting the correction . Chyong looked at his superior . " Maybe our enemies should read the Great Leader 's thoughts . These imperialists are too predictable . " " Or they are trying to put us to sleep . What 's our readiness ? " " Excellent . All of our positions were manned within five minutes . " " Hold our troops there until dawn . Have them conduct subunit training in place on what their roles would be in case the imperialists attacked . Also , move the field commanders ' meeting up from oh seven hundred to oh five hundred . Since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . " While Chyong hurried away with his order , Cho pondered the map . The first support units slated for Red Phoenix had just arrived in their new camps near the DMZ . Could the imperialists have gotten wind of the move ? He dismissed the thought as irrational . They 'd taken great care in scheduling the troop trains to avoid times when American spy satellites were over Korea . The Americans could n't know anything . But the worry returned to nag him as he prepared for the morning 's special meeting with his field commanders and other newly arrived senior officers . He fought it off , determined to avoid any thought that might shake his confidence and spoil the presentation he had planned . Kim Jong-Il still insisted that Red Phoenix be kept a closely guarded secret , but he had finally accepted Cho 's argument that he be allowed to begin molding the proper " aggressive " spirit in his officers and men . This meeting would be a first step in that direction .  | The small , spartan auditorium lay three stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps headquarters . Six division commanders , their deputies , the general commanding his corps artillery , and the 62nd Special Forces brigade commander sat stiffly in high-backed wooden chairs facing a podium flanked by four-foot portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il . " Attention ! " rang in the room as Cho entered . Round-faced and lean , he strode to the podium and nodded to the group . " 1 have just returned from a meeting of the General Staff , where we were addressed personally by the Dear Leader . What I have to tell you is welcome news . " ( : ho chose his words carefully , knowing that they would be taped , transcribed , and shipped to Pyongyang within hours . There they would be scruut inized by Kim for any hint of disloyalty or disbelief . " You are all aware of the disturbances in the South that have prompted certain ' defensive ' measures on our part . " He nodded to the three secondechelon division commanders . " Now further developments require preparation for further action on our part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comment his words aroused fade away . " According to our intelligence network , the capitalist forces that occupy the southern half of Korea are preparing to withdraw . They have recognized the corrupt regime in the South for what it is , and like a thief who no longer trusts his partner , they are leaving . As their own economy collapses , drained by their adventurism , the fascist Americans are unwilling to pay the price of their occupation . " This is not generally known in our nation and must remain so . If the people find out , they may become impatient to liberate their brothers . " Cho paused again , studying the faces of his officers . Already alert , his words had caused them to sit up even straighter in anticipation of the orders that might follow . " The illegal regime in the South has been engaged in a massive military buildup , supported by the Americans . They buy the South 's goods , give it military aid , and help the regime when it suppresses legitimate protests against its excesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next six months the American forces are expected to withdraw completely . It may be that , without its puppetmasters , the regime will collapse of its own weight . " During the period of withdrawal , moreover , the political situation will be unstable . At any time the oppressed peoples of the South may spontaneously rise up and try to overthrow their leaders . We must be ready to go to their aid . If they are too weak to rise up , we will assist them . " Cho stopped for emphasis . He could see the gleam in his officers ' eyes .  | They could sense that they were on the edge of carrying forward to completion the great work begun nearly forty years before during the Great Fatherland Liberation War . He spoke the next words slowly . " The need for such an undertaking may come upon us as suddenly as the north wind . Therefore , the General Staff has reiterated that it is the sworn duty of each and every soldier to be prepared for swift and decisive action . Accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of offensive battle drills over the coming months . Your men and equipment are to be held at a high state of readiness  --  available to carry out any orders the Great Leader sees fit to issue . " Cho stepped back from the podium to survey his audience . " Questions ? " There were none , and Cho carefully studied the reactions he saw emblazoned on his commanders ' faces  --  eagerness , determination , excitement , and curiosity . Very well . He had momentarily lifted the curtain on Red Phoenix , and his generals liked what they saw . They would be ready when the time came .  | " Crap ! " McLaren crumpled the piece of paper and threw it across the room toward a wastebasket . It missed . He shook his head , he must be getting old . I ! is aide nodded toward the paper . " Bad news , General ? " " Yeah , Doug . " He felt himself wanting to pace and willed himself to keep still . " That goddamned sanctions legislation is still moving through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Pentagon 's daily news summary ever since it had been introduced . He did n't pretend to understand all the ins and outs of the legislative process , but any good soldier could recognize a steady advance when he saw one . What the hell was the matter with Congress anyway ? Could n't they see that there was a big , dangerous world out beyond the bounds of their congressional districts ? He did n't like what was happening in South Korea any more than the next American , but you could n't go around threatening to throw away a vital strategic position without having something to replace it . And that was just what Congress was threatening to do . He 'd seen the studies . The sanctions contained in Barnes 's harebrained legislation could wreck the South Korean economy if they went into effect  --  and economic growth was pretty much the sole underpinning for South Korea 's political stability right now . Without it , there 'd be nothing left to hold the country together . What happened next could make the Seoul massacre look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chops , ready to exploit any weakness across the DMZ . Did n't these guys ever look at a map ? The Korean peninsula was a dagger pointed right at the heart of Japan . At least that was how the Japanese saw it , and the Japanese were a pragmatic people . Let the Soviets or Chinese get a bigger foothold here and just watch how fast Japan 's industrial giants would start selling even more high technology to them  --  and any export control  | treaties be damned . The thought was chilling . Take the enormous Soviet edge in sheer numbers of planes , tanks , guns , ships , and submarines . Mix it with a liberal dose of Japanese-supplied high-tech weaponry and sensors , and what did you have ? A goddamned nightmare , that 's what . McLaren grimaced . There had better be some people left in Washington with some brains and guts . " General , do you still want those reports on this week 's alert ? " McLaren started . He must be getting feebleminded , standing around worrying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Hell , yes , Doug . Lay ' em on me . " He walked back around his desk and sat down to start poring through the tangle of reports that , together , would give him a picture of just what had happened up at the Z the last time he 'd called a snap alert . What was it they called them  --  McLaren Specials ? He smiled to himself . He knew his officers hated those alerts , but it was good practice for them . You never knew just what those crazy bastards up in Pyongyang had up their sleeves . You had to be ready for the unexpected when you were stationed in South Korea . His phone buzzed . It was the Signals Room . " Sir , we 've got a priority , scrambled call for you . It 's Admiral Simpson . " McLaren 's eyebrows went up . It must be past midnight , Washington time . The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was working late . " Put him on . " He heard a series of clicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " Hello , Jack , how 's tricks ? " " Phil ! You old son of a bitch . What 's up ? " There was a barely perceptible lag as the microwave signal raced twenty-four thousand miles up to a communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit and then back down to the chairman in Washington . It 's this Barnes sanctions bill . The White House still says it is n't going anywhere this year , but my gut tells me that it just might . Both the House and Senate are getting a case of the electoral willies , and you know how screwed up things can get when they start looking for a foreign policy accomplishment ' to show the voters . " " Hell , Phil . When did you get to be such a big political panjandrum ? " Simpson chuckled . " Goes with the turf . I 've sat in front of so many congressional committees since last year that I 'm even starting to talk like one of them . " " God save us . " " Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes me sound more civilized . " McLaren 's grip on the phone tightened for a moment . His wife , Elly , would probably have agreed with Caroline Simpson .  | But she would n't ever have the chance . Not anymore . He cleared his throat . There was n't time for sorrow . Not now . " Go on , Phil . " " Anyway , I need ammo to give the President a reason to kick this Barnes bill in the head while it 's still young . And what I need from you , Jack , is your best analysis of the situation up North . I need your best guess as to what 's going on up there across the wire . " " I fell , a guess is all you 'll be able to get . " McLaren reached across his desk for a pencil . " Do n't you Pentagon boys already get copies of all my intel reports ? " " I want a new assessment drawn up . I know it might not be much different from the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take in to the President . " " Okay . You 've got it . I 'll get my J-2 to send an update over the wire ASAP " McLaren made a note . Colonel Logan , his intelligence officer , was going to he busy today . " Thanks , Jack . I appreciate it . Look , I 've got ta run . It 's nearly one in the A.M. hack here , and Caroline 's going to have my butt for breakfast if I stay much longer . " McLaren smiled to himself . He could n't imagine anyone , even the admiral 's formidable wife , putting the fear of God into Phil Simpson . He doubted if the thickset little man with the jutting jaw and impish grin had ever truly been afraid of anything or anyone . McLaren and the admiral had been friends since Nam . His battalion had been stationed down near the Mekong Delta , right beside Simpson 's detachment of river gunboats and patrol craft . They 'd fought together against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese regulars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hack-alley bars of both Saigon and Hong Kong . Somewhere along the way they 'd formed a friendship that had lasted through years of peacetime , promotions , and duty assignments around the globe . Each man appreciated the other 's guts and willingness to buck the conventional wisdom to get results . " No problem , Phil . I 'll talk to you later . And that intel report will be sitting on your desk when you get there in the morning . " There was a pause on the other end of the line , and then Simpson asked cautiously , " Look , are you planning on visiting Washington anytime soon ? " " No , why ? " His daughter was supposed to come out to Seoul for Christmas this year . And his son would be at sea over the holidays . " Well , it 's just that this might be a good time to keep out of the States . If you 're in town , some smart-ass congressional aide would probably call you to testify in some public hearing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you come across kinda raw on camera . Know what I mean ? " McLaren laughed , " Yeah , I know what you mean . I flunked Public  | Diplomacy one oh one back at the Point years ago , and I have n't ever bothered to take a refresher course . " " No kidding . I would n't ever have guessed , " Simpson said dryly . " Later , Jack . " " Give my best to Caroline . " McLaren hung up and pressed the intercom button . " Doug , get Charlie Logan over here , pronto . I 've got work for him . " Logan , his J-2 , was a good officer , but he was a little too inclined to slack off if he thought no one was paying attention . McLaren had noticed a tendency to recycle old , approved intelligence reports if the situation had n't changed much . Logan 's laziness would n't put his career at risk , but it would probably keep him from getting his star . Well , Charlie would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs wanted a new North Korea intel assessment by breakfast Washington time , McLaren would make damned sure he got one . OCTOBER 3 ? THE PENTAGON , WASHINGTON , D.C. Combined Forces Korea Intelligence Report : Update Top Secret Warning : Includes Sensitive Intelligence SUMMARY : Recent political and diplomatic maneuvering by North Korea could significantly increase the military threat Pyongyang 's communist regime poses to regional and U.S. security ... Admiral Philip Simpson nodded to himself . McLaren 's J-2 knew how to write a good report . He 'd have Carlson pass it on to the NSC staffer , Fowler , for inclusion into the Interagency Working Group 's final report to the President . The admiral skimmed through the document , looking for anything new that should be highlighted . He found it on page four .

While the precise  | type of aircraft being shipped can not be identified , the crates are large enough to contain any of the current-generation Soviet fighter or ground-attack aircraft . In addition , South Korean National Security Planning Agency ( NSP ) listening posts on random scan have picked up airborne Russian language transmissions that can be interpreted as showing that a new cadre of Soviet instructor pilots are now operating inside North Korea . Since North Korea 's MiG-23 squadrons are now operational , our conclusion is that the new Soviet instructors are training North Korean pilots to fly a new type of aircraft .

Not that he could do much about it . His intercom buzzed . Admiral , your car is here to take you up to the Hill . " Simpson tossed the report into his out box and stood up , reaching for his briefcase . It was time to go to Capitol Hill and jabber at the Senate Armed Services committee about manpower retention rates . He looked at his calendar . This was his fourth congressional appearance of the week . He often thought it was a goddamned wonder that he ever got any work done . OCTOBER 4 ? CNN HEADLINE NEWS The CNN reporter , a pretty brunette , stood in the marble-lined corridor outside a hearing room in the Raybum House Office Building .  | This is Connie Marlowe for CNN Headline News .

From there it would move to the full House of Representatives . " The bill 's chief sponsor , Congressman Ben Barnes of Michigan , was understandably pleased when I spoke with him earlier . " The film cut to taped footage of a smiling Ben Barnes in the same corridor . " Naturally I 'm delighted that my distinguished colleague Congressman Nicholson has seen the importance of swift and decisive action by the House in this matter . America 's roads and stores can not continue to be flooded with shoddy South Korean imports while students are murdered in Seoul 's streets . We must send a clear message to the South Korean government . No more violence . No more repression . No more free ride . " The picture cut back to Connie Marlowe .

" The screen split , showing both the CNN anchorman stationed in Atlanta and the reporter in Washington . " Connie , does n't it take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to end a filibuster ? Does the Korea sanctions bill have that much support in the Senate ? " " You 're right , John . Normally , the majority leader 's confidence would indicate overwhelming support for the bill . But this is a special case . With the election coming up , a lot of challengers have been pummeling Senate incumbents with charges that they never do any work . So even senators who do n't plan to vote for the legislation are eager to avoid a long , wearing filibuster . And right now , it 's just not clear who has the votes to win on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for CNN Headline News . " OCTOBER 6 ? THE HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE , WASHINGTON , D.C. " Mr. Chairman , this proposed rule is outrageous and you know it ! " Henry Fielding , the ranking minority member of the House Rules Committee sounded angry but not surprised . The white-haired representative from  | Missouri glared out across the handful of congressional staffers rapidly scribbling notes on legal pads . The Rules Committee always met in a small , cramped room to hold the number of spectators down to an absolute minimum . In a way that was a true measure of its power . This committee could make or break legislation in a single hour . It set the terms , the rule , under which a given bill would be considered by the full House of Representatives . Legislation that the Speaker liked would get a rule that sharply limited debate and made it impossible to offer so-called killer amendments . Legislation that the Speaker did n't like would n't ever get a rule , period . To make sure of that , the majority party in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules Committee  --  no matter what the real ratio of Democrats to Republicans might be . And the Speaker liked the Korea sanctions bill . Fielding knew the fix was in , but he had sworn to put up at least a token fight . " Mr. Chairman , the rule you and your friends have concocted would prevent members of the House from offering even the most reasonable amendments to this legislation . That is not the way we should be conducting business on this kind of issue . And there is no conceivable excuse for the absurd time limitations you 've placed on the debate . " The chairman , Representative Kerwin Bouchard of Louisiana , interrupted him . " Mr. Fielding , the issues contained in this bill have been fully considered in committee . " Unconsciously he ran a wizened hand through the remaining strands of his hair . His Southern drawl thickened . " There is no reason for further delay and no necessity for extended debate . " Fielding struck back . " With all due respect , Mr. Chairman , that is nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees . This is supposed to he a deliberative body , and your rule would prevent a thorough and reasoned consideration of this legislation . The issues in this Korea sanctions bill are too complex and too important to be handled in this callously partisan fashion . " The chairman listened with interest . Fielding at his best was very good . And the chairman had no doubt he would hear the same phrases and arguments again on the floor when the full House debated this rule . But his instructions from the Speaker were clear , and he had n't gotten this far in the House by crossing the Speaker . He sat back to enjoy the show with complete confidence in the outcome . It took nearly an hour of pro forma argument , but in the end the committee approved the rule by a party-line vote of nine to four . No one on the inside was at all surprised .  | OCTOBER 7 ? THE WHITE HOUSE , WASHINGTON , D.C. Putnam tossed the bulky report back across his desk . " Damn it , Blake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake Fowler looked down at the document and then back to the red face of the national security adviser . He sat down in one of Putnam 's chairs without an invitation . " You asked for the Working Group 's recommendations to the President . And that " ? he pointed to the paper ? " is what you 've got sitting on your desk . " The report was nearly two weeks overdue , but even that had required a minor miracle and countless hours of overtime . The actual writing involved in the analysis of the Barnes Korean sanctions bill had n't taken more than a couple of days of hard , steady work . But getting the precise wording approved by five cabinet departments and intelligence agencies had been nightmarishly complex . Each wanted to leave its stamp on the report , so each made its own set of editorial changes . Changes that required approval by all the rest , and that often prompted a whole new series of rewrites . Blake had circulated so many different drafts that he now knew every classified-documents courier on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle had come in salvaging anything that was clearly written . The members of the Interagency Working Group were solid professionals , but they were n't writers , and they 'd all learned to use bureaucratese . In bureaucratese , people were n't affected , " population subgroups were impacted . " The risks of full-scale warfare were n't increased , " the probability of significant geopolitical and military interaction " underwent an " upward modification . " Blake had dug in his heels to fight off meaningless gibberish like that wherever he could , and he 'd won more fights than he 'd lost . But he knew that none of that mattered to Putnam . Putnam was upset because the State Department had refused to sign off on the report . State 's representative , Tolliver , had n't bothered to attend more than one out of every two or three Working Group meetings , and he 'd been a pain in the ass every time anyway . After a while it had become clear that the secretary of state , a former congressman , was more interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against South Korea than he was in the foreign policy implications of the legislation . And he would n't approve a r document that recommended strong administration opposition and a presidential veto if the Barnes bill got that far . Blake had tried everything he could think of to get the State Department on hoard  --  short of soft-soaping the Working Group 's recommendations . I le 'd even made several attempts to get in to see the secretary personally ,  | without result . The man 's flunkies had used every excuse in the book . The secretary was always away on " national business , " or had an " urgent policy board meeting , " and once they 'd even tried the old standby that he was " receiving an important foreign delegation . " Blake had n't even been able to secure an appointment with the assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs . The message was clear . The State Department , or at least its political leadership , was n't interested in getting into a shitting match with the Congress over South Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasty lunch in the White House commissary with a friend from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency . " Look , Blake , " " Tubby " Barlow had said , " there 's no way you 're gon na get the boys at Foggy Bottom to risk pissing off the Speaker and the majority leader right now . They 're within inches of a new missile agreement with the Soviets . And they are n't taking any chances that some irate congressman might blow the thing because his favorite bill got dumped on by the administration . " The way the upper echelons of the State Department saw it , South Korea just was n't in the same league with a possible superpower arms control treaty . And so the Working Group had decided to go ahead without State 's sanction for their final product . It was either that or come up with nothing at all . From the way Putnam was carrying on , it was clear that he might have preferred that . " Goddamn it . This thing is practically useless to me the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken lose from its hair-sprayed moorings and was flopping around over an eyebrow . The national security adviser impatiently brushed it back into place . Blake shook his head . " I do n't see how you can say that . Okay , State does n't agree with our recommendations . BFD . Five other agencies do . That 's about as solid a bloc as you 're ever going to find in any administration . " Putnam glowered at him . " That 's not going to cut it with the media , Dr. Fowler . You and I both know that somebody at State will leak the secretary 's displeasure with this report to the Post or the Times and then the shit 's really going to hit the fan . The President does n't like to see headlines that say things like Top-Level Rifts Mar Administration Policy . ' " Blake had to admit that Putnam had a point . But it was moot . The State Department was n't going to reverse course and approve the report . And the South Korean situation was too critical for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnes legislation moved through Congress . Jesus , he hoped there were at least a few red faces over in Legislative Affairs . They 'd been telling anyone who would listen that the Barnes bill was just a typical piece of election-year foofaraw . Something introduced to soothe angry voters and then slated for quiet extinction after the ballots were cast . Well ,  | every passing day put that prediction more and more in the column headed l , y the Chicago Tribune 's 1948 election day headline , " Dewey Wins ! " Blake looked back across the desk at Putnam . " So you 're not going to present our recommendations to the President ? " " I did n't say that . " Putnam reached over and tore off a piece of tape . " The President 's asked for a briefing on this Korea thing something in the next tew days . My calendar 's pretty full , but I 'm going to try to squeeze it in somewhere  --  after I 've had time to go through this stuff in a little more detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two fingers , wadding it up into a tiny , sticky ball . Blake wanted to ask why Putnam did n't just ask him to deliver the briefing . But he already knew the answer . Putnam did n't know much more : shout Asian and Pacific affairs than the average daily newspaper reader did , but he did understand the mechanics of power . And in Washington , D.C. , access is power . Putnam guarded the right to personally brief the President with jealous vigor . In nineteen months on the job , he 'd never yet allowed a member of his staff to lead the President through the tangle of position papers , charts , maps , and satellite photos that made up a typical NSC presentation . His rules were clear and absolutely inflexible . The staff experts prepared the briefing and he delivered it . If Putnam still felt uncomfortable with the material , he 'd bring a staffer along . But always with the understanding that they would respond only to direct questions from the President or from Putnam himself . Blake thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putnam 's intentions . It made the red-haired bastard look very much like the all-knowing whiz kid he claimed to be  --  at least to the President . And that was what mattered . He looked up as Putnam flicked the little ball of tape off into his wastebasket . " In any event , Blake , I 've got a few edits to make in your report . " Putnam smiled . " You 've done a pretty good job in putting this thing together , I guess . But it needs a little work to make it more readable . Ca n't risk putting the Boss to sleep during the presentation , now can we ? " Oh , crap . Putnam 's idea of clear prose made federal bureaucratese look like something written by Ernest Hemingway . The man never saw a short , simple , clear word that he did n't think could be replaced by an impossibly long , convoluted clause . *  | Jeremy Mitchell watched the flickering totals on the vote board with one eye and kept the other on his boss , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the Speaker 's chair . He smiled as the totals changed once again , reflecting another congressman who 'd buckled to persuasion from Barnes or pressure from the Speaker . Getting the Speaker on board had been the best thing he 'd ever done . The man was an oily little snake-charming s.o.b. , but he knew the rules and procedures of the House backward and forward . And he 'd bend any of them to get his way . Mitchell looked up at section of the vote board that showed the time remaining . It read " 0:00 . " Just as it had for the last twenty minutes or so . He smiled again . Votes in the House of Representatives were usually supposed to last fifteen minutes or less . If a congressman had n't made it to the floor by then or had n't made up his mind , that was just too bad . In practice , though , the Speaker controlled time in the House , and fifteen minutes was whatever he said it was  --  no matter what the clocks might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes back to the floor . The vote was over . The congressman acting as chairman of the Committee of the Whole took a small piece of paper from one of the clerks . " On this vote , the ayes were two thirty-eight . The nays , one eighty-one . The bill is passed . " Mitchell headed for the door grinning from ear to ear . They 'd done it ! And now it was up to the Senate . The majority leader 's chief aide had already assured him they 'd bring the Korea sanctions bill up as soon as it passed the House . Jeremy Mitchell could smell victory . Victory for the bill and victory for Ben Barnes when he ran for the Senate two years down the road . He was only half right .  | Captain Tony Christopher did not regret coming into Seoul that clay . He had planned on a little shopping . But he had n't planned on spending almost all of his time in the same store . Back at the base that morning there had been the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine , he was no fool . But Seoul was huge  --  more than ten million people lived within its limits . The South Koreans could have a riot at one end of town and still leave enough peaceful city for one Air Force pilot to do some gift-shopping . Anyway , the chance was too good to miss . He only got one day off during the week . Besides , the warnings had been for the Myong-dong district , around the Catholic cathedral , where there had been protests all week . That was bad luck , of course , because the best department stores were all clustered in the Myong-dong area . And he was getting tired of the cheap , touristy stuff they tried to push on you in the Itaewon bargain shops , near the main U.S. Army base just south of Seoul . Fortunately the squadron 's intelligence officer had put him on to a good thing . He 'd suggested taking a look along Insa-Dong , Mary 's Alley . Michaels might not know much about his main job  --  keeping track of enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did have a nose for bargains on things like handcrafted fans , fine jewelry , and ceramics . Exactly the kind of stuff most women liked . Exactly the kind of stuff that might help Tony smooth things out with his current girlfriend , Maria . She was a real looker , short , but with jet-black hair falling straight down to below her waist . They 'd gone out three times , most recently last night . She was fun , with a good sense of humor , and an appreciation of Tory 's flying stories . She also , however , had a tremendous temper  --  a temper that had been triggered when , lost in thought , Tony had called her Carol .  | So at Michael 's recommendation , Tony had come up on the first train from Kunsan to Seoul and then hopped the Seoul subway to the Chongno 3-ga station near Pagoda Park . That had been the easy part . Since then , he 'd spent a long , hot morning browsing his way up Insa-Dong , combing through the antique shops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined the narrow , winding street . The trouble was , he doubted that he could tell a piece of good Korean craftsmanship from the worst piece of junk ever made . And even a " bargain " from one of the Insa-Dong shops was going to take a pretty hefty bite out of his paycheck from Uncle Sam . I ) atnn . Tiny hated dithering around like this . He 'd hoped to make a quick sortie into Seoul for Maria 's gift and still have enough time left for a swing nigh the casino at the Sheraton Walker Hill . He felt lucky and you always had to hit the blackjack tables feeling lucky . But it looked as if he was going to need all that luck just to make the evening train back to Kunsan . Tony zipped up his jacket . He wanted to get out of the chill wind for a while , hut he knew the minute he stepped into a shop he 'd be mobbed by a hunch of Korean salesclerks . They were all so godawful helpful and polite that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony knew that was the fastest way to wind up stuck with something you did n't want , could n't afford , and could n't get rid of . As he stepped off the curb to cross a side street , a sign in a storefront wind ( ) w caught his eye  --  LEE 's KOREAN-ENGLISH BOOKSTORE . That was the ticket . Just the place for a breather . He wheeled and started for it . The bookstore was a godsend all right . It was warm , quiet , and blinds across the store 's two front windows cut out most of the sun 's glare . Tony closed the door firmly behind him , shutting out the roar as a convoy of trucks loaded with riot police rumbled down the street . A short , middle-aged Korean standing behind a counter with a cash register smiled and bowed slightly to him . Tony nodded back politely and moved deeper into the shop , glancing idly at the bookracks around him . There were n't any other customers . And there did n't seem to be a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by people he assumed were modern Korean writers . Books with titles like The Heartless or The Grass Roof did n't have much appeal for Tony  --  his tastes ran more to murder mysteries and thrillers . He moved to the next rack and started thumbing through a translated Korean government publication called An International Terrorist Clique  --  North Korea . " It seemed like pretty heavy-handed stuff , but then he did n't have to live full-time in a country that had enemy commandos landing on its beaches . A sudden increase in the noise coming from outside on the street broke Tony 's concentration . He looked up from the propaganda pamphlet to see ' the little Korean shopkeeper peering intently out through the blinds .  | Then he heard the chanting and the muffled , coughing explosions of tear gas canisters . Tony went up to the front and looked out down the Insa-Dong to see a crowd that filled the street from one end to the other . He had to look hard to see individual people . The first impression he got was one of waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were just coming into view , but he felt he was close  --  way too close . Personal safety aside , the ops officer would ream him good if he got tangled up in this mess . He nodded to the shopkeeper and headed for the door , only to feel the man 's hand on his arm . " Please , you should wait here . I think it 's not good to go out . You help me put up shutters and we wait here . You not like my books ? " Tony smiled and tried to decide , torn between the desire to get the hell out of there ahead of the crowd and the idea of lying low and riding it out . He looked down the street again . He should have time . " Okay , brother . But let 's snap it up . Just where the hell are these shutters ? " The Korean pointed to a pile of heavy sheet metal panels stacked by the counter . Working quickly , they managed to hoist the shutters onto hooks set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he could see out . Tony tapped him on the shoulder . " Is this going to be enough ? I mean , should n't you just lock up so we can both get out of here ? " He could see other figures locking their doors and scurrying away ahead of the oncoming mob . " No . I see this before . There are other crowds , more people other places . We run down street , might find another group . This over in two-three hours . " Tony had to admit that the Korean made sense . Maybe sticking it out here was the best idea . He stood next to the man and watched through the shutters as the mob approached . As a pilot , Tony felt totally outside his element . He could feel his pulse speeding up . This was the kind of situation the groundpounders , the infantry , were trained for  --  not him . The rioters were individuals now , and he could see green-uniformed Combat Police behind and mixed in with them . They were pushing the demonstrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were thorough . Anyone who tried to hide in angles or doorways was cornered and beaten senseless . It was clear , too , that some of the " rioters " were actually people who had just been caught in the protest , swept up as the police moved in . Jesus , it was getting really vicious out there . He could see rioters trying to throw tear gas canisters back at the police , and there were other things flying through the air  --  rocks , bricks , and bottles filled with flaming gasoline . Several masked demonstrators converged on a policeman who 'd gotten too far out in front of his fellows . They ripped his gas mask off , and one of them landed a punch on the man 's throat . Tony saw his mouth open in agony for a second before he went down under a flurry of kicking legs . A patch of color caught his eye , and he saw a Caucasian woman running down the street just in front of the oncoming melee . She was wearing high  | heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a quick impression of copper-colored hair and a green summer dress . But the woman was coughing , and unless she ditched the shoes , she was n't going to get clear . He did n't stop to think . He just reached out and unlocked the front door . " Hold the fort , Mac . I 'll be right back . " The shopkeeper put a hand out , startled , but Tony brushed past him and ducked out onto the street . The noise and smell hit him first  --  and he stayed back against the building to make sure nothing else hit him . Christ , the smell . He could feel his eyes tearing up and his throat drying out . He had been caught by tear gas before , hack in West Germany during an antinuclear protest outside the base where he 'd been stationed . This was n't as bad , but that was a relative term . The first groups of rioters were past him , and he could see rocks and bottles flying through the air in both directions . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could tell , he had n't been noticed . He sprinted the hundred yards to the woman flat out . She had stopped , winded , on the sidewalk . " rimy skidded to a stop on the sidewalk in front of her  --  his eyes half on her and half on the brawl swirling up the street toward them . " Ma'am , come with me ! I 've got a place back there where we can hole up . " He jerked a thumb hack toward the bookstore . She looked at him without much expression at all . " Hole up ? " She was breathing heavily and rubbing her feet . " I mean where we can get out of this mess . " Christ , this was n't any time for an English lesson . He looked nervously over her shoulder as the mob closed on them . " Ma'am , I 'd get rid of those heels if I were you . They 're nice , but they are n't Nikes ! " She looked at him and then at the chaos behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she kicked out of her heels , scooped them off the pavement , and ran down the street , shoes in one hand and a package in another . Tony ran to catch up , shouting , " The bookstore on the left ! " This lady was fast . Even with the noise behind pushing him along , he caught up to her only when she slowed to find the shop front . Tony banged on the door and it opened just long enough for them to duck inside . The Korean slammed it shut as if it were spring-loaded . He looked up at Tony . " This is good . You find your lady friend . Both now safe . " The woman flushed red . Tony glanced over at her , embarrassed , and then back to the shopkeeper . " I do n't know her . I just did n't think we should leave her out on the street . " I 'm glad you did n't . Thank you both . " She started to put on her shoes , and Tony reached out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | on one leg and slipped on one shoe , then switched legs and repeated the process . Tony pulled his hand back before she noticed it . Hell , she was n't just pretty  --  she was damned pretty . She had a nice figure , but what really caught his eye was a mop of curly copper-colored hair . She wore it shoulder-length , and combined with the pale , freckled complexion only redheads can have , she was a knockout . She was tall , only half a head shorter than Tony , and that much taller than the shopkeeper . And that was an American accent if he 'd ever hear one . He straightened his shoulders . " Ma'am , I 'm just glad I could help . " He reached out again , turning the charm meter up to level three . " My name 's Tony Christopher . " She took his hand . " Pleased to meet you , Mr. Christopher . I had n't counted on running into something like this . " She suddenly smiled . " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tony was worried . Level three was n't a killer , but " Mr. Christopher " ? Sheesh . He tried level five . " Call me Tony , please . " Before she could reply , something or someone slammed off the bookstore 's shutters , making them all jump . Anne whitened . " They 're going crazy out there . What 's going on around here all of a sudden ? " Tony shrugged helplessly . " I do n't know . This is out of my field . Ask me about MiGs or flying , but not this stuff . " They could hear windows breaking across the street . He turned to the Korean shopkeeper . " Say , have you ever seen anything this violent before ? " " No , not before . But all riots bad . Criminals and communists and ungrateful children . They make too much trouble , and everyone suffers . My shop will smell of the gas for weeks . " Anne said , " But the police , they 're clubbing people . " The Korean 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protesting the government ! They should see how I lived thirty , forty years ago . They go to school and instead of classes they march in the street and throw rocks ! They should obey parents and use chance to go to school . I wish I could go to university . They could have better life , build country . " He shook his head slowly and gestured outside . " Instead , they tear things up . " Tony peered through a crack between the window shutters . Groups of students and police were struggling  --  sometimes attacking , sometimes fleeing . He felt as if he were watching it on television , but the sounds were too real , and you could n't catch the gut-wrenching stench of the tear gas on television . He could see several hundred people , mostly white-masked students with some other civilians mixed in , trying to make a stand in the street outside . But a solid line of green-uniformed Combat Policemen were working their way slowly up the street breaking heads . Squads in phalanx formation charged knots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closing with clubs . Behind the advancing  | police line , troopers handcuffed individual rioters , none too gently , and dragged them over to waiting security vans . At the same time , trucks with water cannon and grenade launchers fired at larger groups , driving the mass of people farther up the street . It was a well-organized operation , pulverizing a mass of organized demonstrators into dazed individuals , safely under control . He and Anne both watched as the police line moved toward the bookstore . As the fighting got closer , details popped out . Two policemen handcuffed a glassy-eyed student , threw him to the ground , and kicked him savagely . Just a few feet away , another demonstrator picked up a tear gas grenade from the pavement and lobbed it back toward the police . He went down with blood streaming from his forehead , knocked senseless by a rubber bullet fired at near point-blank range . Another had a spray can . As a riot trooper ran at him , the kid pressed the spray button , then held a lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the student try to aim his improvised flamethrow at the oncoming policeman . But the helmeted trooper knocked the spray can away with a long billy club , then whipped the weapon down onto the student 's unprotected head smashing the boy to the pavement with a series of short , vicious blows . The man ran on , leaving the kid huddled in agony on the ground . ' Iiony looked back at the Korean shopkeeper . He was sitting at his desk in the hack , quietly working . He was n't accomplishing much though , since he glanced up every five or ten seconds . When he saw Tony looking , he quickly fixed his gaze on the papers in front of him and did not look up again . Anne did n't say anything . She just shivered occasionally . Tony could n't think of anything to say that would n't sound ridiculously out of place . So they stood together , behind the shutters , watching silently as the South Korean riot police broke the demonstration into fragments . It was over in minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armored cars advanced past up the block . Like water spraying from a hose , the crowd scattered onto other cross-streets , and as the fighting moved on , the noise outside fell away  --  leaving an almost eerie quiet in its place . They waited a few moments more , unwilling to believe that the brutal street battle they 'd witnessed had ended so quickly . But it had , and finally Tony looked over at Anne with a questioning look . Anne nodded , seeming almost afraid somehow to break the silence . Tony looked out through the shutters again , craning to catch a glimpse of the streets down which the riot had flowed . It seemed all clear . " Hold up for a second , " he said , and walked back to thank the bookstore owner for sheltering them . He also wanted to pay the man for the pamphlet he 'd been holding crumpled in his hand for almost an hour . The man ' smiled , came with him to the door , and unlocked it .  | He ushered Tony and Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished him good luck . " Please , do not pay attention to this , this incident . " He gestured at the debris-strewn pavement . " Do not judge Korea by these hooligans . They are fools . They do not know what they do . " As they stepped out onto the empty street , Tony half-expected to feel as if he were walking across a deserted battlefield . But the wind had blown the tear gas away and it felt strangely like an early morning , like those quiet , still hours just before people wake up and the stores open for business . And Tony knew that the stores along the Insa-Dong would soon reopen . There had been a riot , but the police had restored order . At least that 's what they would say on the evening news . Yeah , right . As far as Tony was concerned that was like calling a plane crash " an undesirable ground/air interface . " He looked at his watch . Plenty of time to spare before his train left for Kunsan . Well , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang around waiting to get teargassed again . He glanced at Anne . She seemed uncertain , hesitant somehow . ' " Look , can I get you a cab or help you find someplace ? I 'm not real familiar with Seoul , but I 've got a pretty good map . " Anne looked even less certain than she had before , if that was possible . " Oh , no . No , I do n't think so . " She paused . " I took the subway to get out here . " Tony smiled . " No problem . I 'm heading back that way myself . I 'd be glad to see you to the station . " He was pretty sure he could find it again . Anne kept her eyes fixed about the level of his shoes . Tony felt frustrated . Hell , he did n't bite  --  at least not that often . And he could n't stand around here in the street forever , waiting for this woman to make up her mind about whether or not she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced up at him , but only for a split second . " Well ... " Then in a rush , " Thank you , Mr. Christopher , I 'd appreciate it . " She looked down the street . " I 'd feel better with some company ... to the station , I mean . " He grinned . " Please . Call me Tony . The only time I 'm called Mr. Christopher is when I 've screwed up . It has negative connotations for me . " That got her . Anne laughed lightly . " Okay , Tony , lead on . " He decided he liked the way she said his name . She gave it a musical quality somehow , or maybe it was just the faint hint of a Southern drawl . Anne considered the man beside her as they walked . She did n't particularly mind his putting the moves on her . He was a pilot , after all . She did mind his assuming that she 'd automatically be charmed by his looks and his line . Still , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being polite , almost  | courtly . As they talked , his manner changed her initial feelings . His freshness and honesty made it hard for her to hold anything against him . They headed south down the Insa-Dong , walking past the still-shuttered shop windows at a rapid clip . Tony did n't want to spend any more time in the area than he absolutely had to . Anne did n't have any trouble keeping up with him , and Tony found himself admiring her graceful stride out of the corner of his eye . The streets were still quiet , but after a few blocks they began seeing a few other cautious pedestrians going about their business . Finally they came to a block where the shops were unshuttered , and Tony felt as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders . Without realizing it he slowed down . l le nodded at the store windows filled with beautifully painted screens and elegant furniture . " Hardly seems like we 're in the same country , does it ? " Anne followed his glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . How can they just pretend nothing 's happened ? " Tony shrugged . He liked the Koreans he 'd met so far during his tour . They were tough , hardworking , and friendly . But there was no getting around the fact that they belonged to a completely different culture . Things that struck Americans as wildly out of kilter often seemed normal to Koreans and vice versa. like the time that Korean pilot had tried to persuade him to order marinated dog for example . Tony 's stomach , already unsettled by the tear gas , rebelled at the thought . Whoops . Do n't lose it , son , he warned himself . He had a hunch he would n't impress Anne very much by being sick all over the pavement in front of her . And he suddenly realized , he did want to impress her . Well , why should that surprise him ? After all , here he was ten thousand miles away from home , strolling along beside a pretty American woman . Hell , his wingman , Hooter , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and room key by now . But then Hooter was a daredevil son of a bitch all the time  --  whether he was in the air or on the ground . Tony liked to think he was a bit more tactically minded . They stopped at a cross-street , waiting for a break in the heavy traffic . That was reassuring . Where there were cars , there were n't likely to be any demonstrations . Korean drivers did n't like seeing their windshields smashed , and they seemed to have a sixth sense for staying out of trouble spots . He heard a relieved sigh from Anne and smiled . " Yeah . I think we 're out of the danger zone now . " He paused , trying for just the right emphasis on the key words . " You know , I sure never expected a visit to Seoul to be more nerve-racking than a low-altitude dogfight . " It was the second time that he had hinted about flying . She decided to rise to the bait . " Dogfight ? Are you a pilot ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice casual . " Oh , yeah . I fly F-16s for the Air Force . " He waited , expectantly . " Oh . That 's nice . " Anne looked both ways down the road , keeping an eye out for oncoming traffic . That 's nice ? That 's nice ? Tony could hardly believe it . She sounded as if he 'd just told her he was a plumber or something . But he had to laugh , mostly at himself . What did he expect her to do  --  faint dead away at being so near a real , live fighter pilot ? Get a grip on yourself , guy . He looked over sharply at Anne , but she had her eyes resolutely fixed on the pavement again . Damnit . Was she smiling ? He could n't tell , and he could n't think of any clever way to find out . Damn , damn , and double damn . He could see the subway station entrance just a block ahead when suddenly Anne 's head snapped up , her eyes wider than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you hear that ? That popping noise , just now . " Popping noise ? What the hell was she talking about ? Then he heard it . A long , rolling series of muffled explosions  --  like cooking popcorn or a string of Chinese firecrackers . It was off to the west , toward the city center , but it was getting louder . The riot was moving back this way , nastier than ever . He took Anne 's hand without even thinking about it . " C'm on . " They ran toward the subway station , jostled their way in with a crowd of Korean commuters , and took the down escalator two steps at a time . The station was noisy , crowded with Korean businessmen and shoppers heading home after a long day , but they could hear wailing police sirens rushing past on the street above them . Tony kept hold of Anne 's hand until they pushed their way onto a packed subway car , along with most of the others who 'd been lining the tracks . As the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne pulled her hand away  --  gently but firmly . The other passengers were restless and just as edgy as Tony and Anne . They 'd heard the sirens , and many had heard the shooting off in the distance above the station . As they chattered back and forth in worried tones , Tony wished he 'd learned more than phrase-book Korean . Shit , he knew why they were worried . The train they were on was moving west  --  right toward the direction of the riot . Tony could have kicked himself . This was the right subway line to Seoul Station , but he could have gone around the other way . Now , he 'd put both himself and Anne at risk just because he 'd rushed onto the first damned train that came along . He swore under his breath . Anne heard him and leaned over . " Do n't worry about it . I did n't think either . " She was pale but seemed under control . Tony felt a little better . He just hoped the train 's engineer knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he went rocketing through the next station , Chongak , without slowing . Tony could see the huge crowd waiting by the tracks frantically trying to wave the train down . But they were through and into the next dark tunnel in a matter of seconds . Once there , the subway train started slowing to a more normal speed . They must be past whatever was going on . Tony pulled out his city guide . Chongak Station led out onto Sejong Street , wherever the hell that was . And there would only be one more stop before they got to the railroad station . 1 Ic looked over at Anne . " I 'm supposed to get off at Seoul Station , but let me get you to your hotel , first . " She got a strange look on her face . " My hotel ? " She shook her head . " I 'm not a tourist , I work in the logistics section at Yongsan . " Yongsan . That was the main U.S. Forces military base in Seoul . Just who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick look at her hands . No , no rings . So what was she doing at Yongsan ? She must have read his mind . " I work there . For the Army . " It should n't have , but that took Tony by surprise and it must have showed on his face . Anne frowned . " You 've heard that some women are smart enough to make their own way in the world , I suppose . " She looked a little taken aback by what she 'd said . ( ) ops . Where the hell was an ejection seat when you really needed one . flow was he going to dig himself out of this hole ? The train stopped at the City Hall station , but no one got off and more people forced their way on board . " Look , I 'm sorry . " He stopped . Saying he was apologizing for not thinking she was smart enough to work for a living was a lot like being asked if you had stopped heating your wife . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to get to know you better . " The train was starting to brake . 1lis stop must be just ahead . Damn , there was n't time to do this with any finesse . " Could I see you sometime , you know , maybe for dinner ? I 'm not such a bad guy when I 'm not stuck in the middle of a riot , honest . " He tried to smile . Christ , he felt like a high school freshman again . He had n't had trouble talking to women for years , so why now ? Anne 's reply was immediate . And uncompromising . " Thanks , but I do n't think so . " She was blushing again . She looked away from his eyes . " I do want to thank you for helping me this afternoon ... " The train 's brakes squealed as it shuddered to a stop inside Seoul Station , drowning out her words . Tony had to go . The car doors opened and he was being half-carried out ' by the surge of Korean commuters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , how about meeting some afternoon for lunch ? Or maybe you could show me the sights . " He got pushed out of the car before she could reply . The doors slammed shut . Tony tried looking in the windows as the subway train started to pull away , but he could n't tell whether she was shaking her head no or yes . He stood watching the train lights disappear out of sight into the darkness . Shit , he had n't even gotten her phone number . He caught his train back to Kunsan without any further trouble . And that was almost too bad . He would have welcomed the excuse to really blow up . Instead he had to sit quietly in another compartment crowded with Korean commuters and shoppers . And the trip back to base gave him more than enough time to replay every line of that last disastrous conversation with Anne Larson . Tony got back the BOQ just before seven and washed up . He had to change all his clothing because of the tear gas smell . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the hall and knocked on Hooter 's door . He heard a muffled , " Come on in , for Christ 's sake . Quit trying to knock my door down . " His wingman looked up from the latest men 's magazine he 'd managed to snag in the PX . Hooter 's face creased into a smile . " Hey , Saint ! Back from Seoul so soon ? Man , you got ta read this article . " Hooter tapped the magazine in front of him . Tony looked down . The article was a natural blonde . " So how was the big day in the big city ? Tell Uncle Hooter all . And spare no details . " Tony weighed the truth with more comfortable fiction and decided on a compromise . " It was okay . I got caught in a riot and struck out with a pretty girl . No big deal . " The fiction part was the " no big deal . " It was a big deal , to him . It was more than just the challenge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne had looks , grace , and lot of class . He definitely wanted to see her again , and he 'd blown it .  | The dry mumble of the clerk 's calling the roll ended , but it took the sharp hang of the Senate president 's gavel to bring Blake Fowler 's eyes back to the TV picture being broadcast on the C-SPAN cable channel . f le squinted up at the screen : 54-45 . The conference version of the Korean sanctions bill had been passed by nine lousy votes . Well , that was n't much of a surprise . The margin had been the same two days earlier when the Senate passed the bill for the first time . Damn it . He knew for a fact that they could have switched at least six of those votes if the President had declared his opposition to the bill . Instead there 'd been nothing but silence from the East Wing of the White House . Blake knew the kind of pressure that was being exerted to win the President 's consent to the Korean sanctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weekly visits by the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader . Barnes and his allies were pulling out all the stops . Naturally . The congressman from Michigan was openly angling to become the next senator from Michigan , and it was no secret that he planned to ride the protectionist , anti-Korea bandwagon all the way into the Senate chamber . What Blake could n't understand was the glacial pace that Putnam had set in orchestrating the administration 's internal opposition to the sanctions bill . He 'd had the Working Group 's report in his hands for over a week now . Why had n't he briefed the President ? With the congressional elections coming up in less than three weeks , there was n't much time left to pull the head of state 's mind back from domestic politics to foreign affairs . He picked up the phone and dialed Putnam 's office . Putnam 's secretary was apologetic but unhelpful . " I 'm sorry , Dr. Fowler , but he 's tied up in a meeting right now . He 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another message ? "  | Blake knew there were already at least ten pink message slips with his name and number littering her desk . " No , that 's all right , Liz . I 'm just trying to find out when he 's planning to meet with the President on this Korea thing . " Putnam 's secretary lowered her voice . " Korea ? I thought you 'd heard . He 's briefing the President and the cabinet tomorrow morning . Did n't he call you ? " Blake kept his voice level . " No . I guess it slipped his mind . " " Hold on for just a moment . I 'll see if I can pull him away from his congressional guests long enough to ask him about it for you . " He heard the line go silent as she put him on hold . That son of a bitch . What kind of games was he playing now ? Pumam 's secretary was back in less than a minute . She sounded embarrassed . " I 'm sorry . He said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's going to do the briefing himself . " Blake hung up slowly . He 'd been shut out by Putnam before . But never on something so crucial . Just what the hell was going on over in the East Wing ? OCTOBER 16 ? THE WHITE HOUSE , WASHINGTON , D.C. The President looked around the half-empty Cabinet Room while Putnam droned on . It might have been nice for once to have a full complement of his senior advisors present for an important meeting . But the world did n't want to cooperate . Crises , both domestic and foreign , always seemed to drain people out of Washington at the damnedest times . So , now that he needed to make a decision on this Korean sanctions bill , half his key people were scattered across the globe . The secretary of commerce was in Japan for high-level trade negotiations . And both the secretary of defense and the CIA director were off flitting around Europe briefing the NATO governments on the latest round of conventional arms talks . Even the vice president was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a small cadre of foreign and military policy experts to canvass ? basically just the secretary of state and Putnam . He 'd thought about putting this meeting off , but Putnam had assured him that the views of both Defense and the CIA were included in his Working Group 's report . The man had also managed to deftly remind him that polls showed a growing public impatience with what they saw as his administration 's reluctance to take swift , decisive action on important issues . The President sighed . He 'd campaigned on the promise of " hands-on " leadership and management . Did n't people realize it took time to assimilate all the derailed knowledge that required ? He was beginning to envy his  | predecessor 's seeming ability to make snap judgments that turned out to be more right than wrong . " Mr. President ? You had a question , sir ? " Putnam had stopped in midbriefing , pointer resting on large-scale map of the North Pacific . " No , George . No questions just yet . Go ahead and finish your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and stared down at his notes for a couple of moments before continuing . " Let me quickly summarize the Working Group 's findings and recommendations , gentlemen . First , the trade sanctions included in the bill would have a powerful impact on South Korea 's economy . Given that , it seems clear to me that no rational government would risk their full implementation . " " And , " Putnam continued , " they would have little substantive impact on our own economy in the unlikely event that we have to put them in place . Korean products are a convenience  --  not a necessity . " I I is eyes strayed over to the Defense secretary 's empty chair . " Finally , although the Department of Defense and the intelligence agencies are not especially happy about the bill 's troop withdrawal provisions , it 's clear that South Korea 's armed forces no longer need rely on our protection to deter aggression from the North . " Plus , there 's a side strategic benefit to pulling our troops out of South Korea and basing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Command , we can strengthen our rapid deployment forces and enhance our ability to respond to military crises anywhere in the world . " Putnam turned his gaze on the President , a tall , slender man with thinning hair , an open , friendly countenance , and steel-blue eyes . " All in all , sir , I think a consensus view would be that the bill is worth signing . A kw agencies have expressed some minor concerns " ? he flicked the bulky document in front of him ? " but I do n't believe that any of them are important enough to warrant a presidential veto  --  and all of the accompanying political heat . " He walked back to the table and sat down . The President sat quietly for several seconds and then looked over at his secretary of state . " Well , what 's your view , Paul ? Should I sign this thing or not ? " Like the President , the secretary was a big man . Unlike him , however , the secretary fought a constant , losing battle against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , graying hair . He steepled his massive hands and glanced quickly over at Putnam before answering . " Well , Mr. President , I have n't heard anything from my own experts that would contradict this version of the Working Group 's report . " He paused . " I 'd sign it , Mr. President . Our back-channel communications with the South Korean government have n't achieved much of anything , and frankly , I do n't think this is the right time to anger the congressional leadership by vetoing a bill they 've backed so solidly . "  | " Damn it , Paul . I did n't get myself elected to run scared from the boys hack up on the Hill . " " I 'm not suggesting that , Mr. President . I 'm simply saying that the situation in South Korea is intolerable and growing worse . I do n't believe this administration should have to wear that kind of albatross around its neck with an election coming up . Let 's pull the security blanket away from Seoul and see how they react . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be willing to bet that they 'll come running to us with the kinds of political reforms the bill demands . And in less than a month . " The President looked back at the map of the North Pacific . " I was n't aware that you supported this legislation so strongly , Paul . " " I do n't , Mr. President . I do n't like Congress trying to push its nose into our foreign policy any more than I suspect you do . But I also know that there 's a time and a place to fight that kind of interference . " The secretary pushed his half-frame reading glasses back up his nose . " This is n't either the time or the place . " He started counting off items on his fingers . " South Korea 's in a shambles . The government is increasingly brutal and desperate . The students seem determined to stay out in the streets . There 's no denying that the Koreans have n't been trading fairly with us . And two-thirds of the American people want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we tried sterner measures . Certainly we have n't gotten very far using ordinary diplomacy . " " Hell , I ca n't disagree with you there , Paul . But I do n't like this idea of pulling our troops out of South Korea . It could send the wrong message to our other allies . Not to mention Moscow . " " Mr. President , " Putnam broke in , " it 's unlikely to ever come to that . It takes time to arrange a large-scale military movement . The South Korean government will almost certainly take the actions we 're seeking long before our first soldier steps onto a plane heading back to the States . " The President raised an eyebrow and looked around the table at the rest of his cabinet . " Well , gentlemen . Anyone else have anything to add ? " A chorus of shaking heads greeted his question . That was about what he had expected . The secretaries of departments like Energy , Housing and Urban Development , Labor , or Education were n't eager to step into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , Defense , and the CIA . The President sat back slightly from the table and let his eyes slide back to the map . Decision time . He was n't particularly happy with the answers he 'd gotten , but at least his key people were fairly well united for once . He could feel Putnam and the secretary of state staring at him . The President ran over the variables one more time . The bill 's economic impact on the U.S. : negligible . Military impact : minor and controllable , at least according to  | Putnam 's Working Group and the State Department . Political impact : positive . The polls showed that . And hell , maybe it would convince the South Koreans to get their act together . Okay , so be it . He turned away from the map and brought his gaze back to the waiting cabinet . " Very well , gentlemen . I 'll sign this damned thing . " Putnam smiled . " Yes , sir . We can arrange a Rose Garden signing with the congressional leadership for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President frowned . " You 'll do nothing of the kind , George . I may be willing to accept this bill , but I 'll be goddamned if I 'm going to give people like Barnes or the Speaker free publicity for having shoved it down our throats . ( : Tear ? " Putnam turned red and nodded . " ( Iou.I . I 'll sign it tonight . In the Oval Office . You can have Jack put out a press release tomorrow morning . " The President flipped to the next page on his agenda . " Okay , let 's move on to this housing bill coming up in the Senate . " I le fought down the urge to reconsider his decision . It was done and that was that . Was n't it ? OCTOBER 17 ? OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING , WASHINGTON , D.C. " I lc 's gone where ? " Blake could n't keep the disbelief out of his voice . " i JE ) to the Greenbrier for the weekend , Dr. Fowler . " Putnam 's secretary sounded surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort favored by many in Congress for retreats , conferences , and just plain getaways . " Well , when do you expect him back , Liz ? " Blake swiveled in his chair to keep the afternoon sun out of his eyes . " Not for a week or so . He 's going straight from the Greenbrier on to a speaking tour out across the country . Election rallies . That sort of thing . " " Shit . " Blake could n't believe it . The President signs that goddamned Barnes sanctions bill and Putnam heads out on some kind of victory parade . Something was not at all right in the State of Denmark . " Look , Liz . Did he have you make a lot of changes to that report I gave him ? " Putnam 's secretary was silent for several seconds and then said , " Yes . He rewrote whole sections . " That bastard . What had he done ? " Can I get a copy of the latest draft ? " Silence again . " Uh , Dr. Fowler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't allowed to distribute it to anyone but the President and the other people at the cabinet meeting yesterday . "  | Bingo . " I suppose that counts me out . " Blake grimaced . He had to find a way to see what Putnam had done to the Working Group 's recommendations . Putnam 's secretary said , " I 'm sorry , Dr. Fowler . I 'm afraid it does . " She stopped and then said , " But I do have an extra copy here on my desk . I have n't had time to log it in yet . And I 'm going to have to step out for a few minutes . " Blake hung up smiling . Thank God for Liz Klein . She 'd been around the White House through three different Administrations and she knew exactly how to play the game . He got up and stuck his head out his office door . " Katie , could you come in here a second . There 's something I want you to pick up for me over at the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission and then sat down to consider his next move . Whatever he did , he was going to need allies . Powerful ones . People that the President could n't ignore . And if Putnam had monkeyed around with the Working Group 's report the way Blake thought he had , the next several days were going to be critical . He also knew that chances of his staying employed in the administration were just about nil . He sat waiting for Katie to get back , looking at the picture of his wife and five-year-old daughter . OCTOBER 19 ? THE NBC NIGHTLY NEWS The camera view showed what were now almost routine scenes from the South Korean capital . Masked , chanting students throwing rocks and firebombs at police troops who retaliated with tear gas , water cannon , and billy clubs . Long-distance shots from a chartered helicopter showed the fine , white tear-gas mist billowing above Seoul 's city center . The anchorman 's calm , dispassionate tones were in sharp contrast with the televised pictures of complete chaos and random violence . " Thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today  --  the seventh consecutive day of anti-government protests that have virtually paralyzed this city of ten million . " The demonstrators once again clashed with government security forces in several hours of street fighting that left another sixty people injured , many in critical condition . And there are no signs that the riots will end anytime soon . " The camera cut back to the anchor desk . " In other Korean news today , a government spokesman lashed out at the new U.S. trade sanctions scheduled to go into effect within the month . According to the spokesman , South Korea , quote , utterly rejects this unprincipled attempt by the Inited States to interfere in the internal affairs of another freely elected government , end quote . The spokesman went on to say that South Korea 's coalition  | government saw no reason to give in to the impossible demands made by the rioting students . " However , informed sources report that the South Korean government will soon announce a series of cosmetic political reforms  --  in the hope that they will placate the rioting students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Economic Community announced that it would follow the example set by the U.S. in imposing sanctions on South Korean manufiutured products . This European action is considered extremely significant by foreign policy and economic analysts because the EEC is the third-largest purchaser of South Krrrea 's exports , after the U.S. and Japan . " The camera cut again , this time to pictures of a flag-waving political rally in lllinOis . ' And in Chicago , today , presidential national security adviser George Putnam told a cheering crowd of union members that the U.S. sanctions showed America 's commitment to fair trade and to the cause of democratic reform in South Korea . " OCTOBER 20-SEOUL , SOUTH KOREA General ( ' hang Jae-Kyu , commanding officer of the 4th Infantry Division , stepped carefully through the door of the Han Chung Kak kisaeng house . He smiled politely at the young woman who took his officer 's cap and overcoat . Charming . And so beautiful . He really must find out her name and ask for her the next time he came here . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made even the sophisticated pleasures of Seoul 's most attractive kisaeng pale in importance . Chang followed the woman down a quiet corridor lined with precious paintings and silk screens . He shook his head , amused that he now found such luxury and beauty so commonplace that he could disregard it . Chang was a farmer 's son , a man of the earth . His family had labored for countless generations , growing the crops that fed Korea 's elite city dwellers . The Army had changed all that . It had nurtured and protected him . It had given him a future , just as it had safeguarded the future for all of South Korea . He frowned . And now these effete city snobs , the corrupt politicians and radical students alike , threatened to destroy all that  --  to emasculate the bulwark of the state and the new order . Chang straightened his shoulders . They would not succeed . Not without a fight . The kisaeng stopped outside a closed door and bowed . He bowed back and followed her with his eyes as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study in elegant grace . Well , perhaps there were advantages to cities after all . He turned , knocked once , and entered the small , smoke-fogged room  | beyond the door . He knew the officers assembled around the table intimately , well enough to trust them with his life . They were classmates , graduates of the Korean Military Academy . Chang nodded to them . " Gentlemen . It is good to see you all here . " They grinned back at his formal tone . He studied them for a moment before continuing . General Bae , commanding officer of the 9th Infantry Division , part of the Capital Corps that guarded Seoul . He was tall for a Korean , with a round , moon face . Colonel Kim of the 6th Interceptor Squadron was shorter and had quick , hurried movements . Colonel Min , G-2 for the III Corps , looked uncomfortable . He was as fat as a Korean Army officer ever gets , which is not much . Most importantly , General Hahn , head of the Seoul District of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anticipation . It was because of him that Chang and his small cadre could meet here in complete safety . The politicians expected the Defense Security Command to play watchdog over the armed forces . Chang smiled to himself as he looked at Hahn . But what happened when the watchdog turned on its supposed master ? " Are we secure here ? " he asked . " Yes , my men swept it for listening devices just this afternoon . It was clean . " " Good . Then we can get down to business . " Chang looked over his assembled friends . " I apologize for rushing this , but time is not our ally . None of us can afford to be missed or brought under suspicion during this time of preparation . " " So you 're convinced then that we must move against the government ? " Lieutenant Colonel Min did n't sound completely surprised . " I can see no other alternative . " Chang kept his voice low , but the others could hear the steely determination that had won him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He continued , " As officers , we are sworn to defend this nation against its enemies , foreign and domestic . And can any doubt that our country is under attack ? " The others , their minds full of images from the past two months of rioting and disorder , shook their heads . " No , I thought not . But what have these politicians , these vote-buyers , done about it ? Nothing . " Chang let the word hang in midair for a moment and then repeated it . " Nothing . " Oh , they talk a grand game . But instead of swift , decisive action to crush this communist insurrection , the bureaucrats have spent their time running from one place to another , pissing on the fires only when the flames reach their feet . " The officers chuckled at his crude imagery . ' And now , what are they planning ? " Chang asked scornfully . " I 'll tell you .  | They are preparing a surrender . A surrender to these young thugs and their calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerable demands . " The officers murmured to one another , and Chang could see the anger growing . " So then , I ask you , what else can we do as men who 've sworn to guard the nation with our very lives ? " General Bae answered for the others after glancing around the room . " You are right . We must reform the government . And soon . " They all knew what he meant by " reform . " He meant a military coup . It was not unthinkable . Twice before in the forty-year-long history of the Republic of Korea , groups of young officers had acted to save the country from corrupt , feuding politicians . They would simply be following in that tradition . Chang held up a hand . " You 're right . There is little time . But we must not act with undue haste . We six alone are not enough to topple the regime . " 1 le smiled and bowed to Hahn . " There are others in the armed forces who shire our determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall bring them into the fold in the coming weeks . " He paused for a moment . " And when we are ready , we shall move with lightning speed to oust the moneygrubbers of Seoul and restore order . " That won approving nods and smiles from the group . Only Min still looked troubled . " But what of the Americans ? Wo n't they intervene ? " ( : hang did n't bother to hide his contempt . " The Americans ? They 've washed their hands of us . Now we owe them nothing . They can do nothing . And once we 've ended these disturbances , their corporations will be back begging us to trade with them once again . " lie looked squarely at Min . " So . Are you with us , or not ? " In the silence that followed his question , they could all hear faint sirens from outside as the police rushed to quell yet another riot . Min listened for a moment and then stared straight back into Chang 's eyes . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly smiled . Now they could begin .  | Blake Fowler sat quietly in the antechamber outside the Oval Office , resisting an urge to pace . He glanced across the room at Admiral Philip Simpson , Chairman of the JCS , who sat conferring with an aide . He double-checked his briefing folder to make sure he had all the documents he would need for this morning 's show . Or maybe " showdown " would be a more accurate term for what he had planned . " Dr. Fowler ? " The dark-haired secretary had raised her head from her work . " Yes . " " The President will see you in just a couple of moments . He 's on the phone right now , but it should n't take long . " Blake nodded his thanks and sat back . This waiting was the hardest part . At least he hoped so . He was acutely aware that the next fifteen minutes or so would be the most crucial of his entire career . In fact , they could easily be the last fifteen minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a week preparing for this meeting . First , he 'd had to persuade Mike Sinclair , Putnam 's deputy , to give him a chance to deliver the President 's daily national security briefing . Putnam was still away on his preelection campaign swing , but he was due back in a couple of days , and Blake knew this would be his last opportunity to get in to see the President . Sinclair disliked Putnam as much as everybody else on the NSC +t aff , and he 'd finally agreed  --  thinking that Blake , as one of the staff 's rising young stars , just wanted a chance to impress the President while the adviser was away . Blake had n't disillusioned him . But he knew that Sinclair was Koing to he damned mad when he found out the truth . Next , he 'd sought out the kind of ally he 'd need to persuade the President that this was more than just a quibble over words and staff procedures .  | Admiral Simpson had been the logical choice . He 'd supported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's senior military officer . And the admiral had a well-deserved reputation as a man who put the truth above political expediency . But Blake had only met the admiral twice before , once at a Georgetown dinner party and once at a conference on grand strategy for the Pacific region , so he 'd been surprised when Simpson agreed to see him the same day he 'd asked for an appointment . He 'd been even more surprised when the hull-necked little man had readily agreed to come to the Oval Office with him . Simpson had grinned across his desk . " What 's the matter , Dr. Fowler ? I lavc n't you ever come across someone willing to gamble a thirty-year career in the military before ? " " Frankly , Admiral , no , I have n't . At least not in this town . " " Well , I 'll tell you , my friend , I 'm willing to do this for two very good reasons . First , the President 's made a goddamn big strategic error in signing that sanctions bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and that someone is probably me . The taxpayers should be able to count on something for the seventy-five thousand dollars a year I get paid . And second , ( ; eorge Putnam is a slimy son of a bitch and it 'll be a pleasure to put a stake through his heart . " Blake smiled as he remembered Simpson 's words . He just hoped that the admiral 's optimism was justified . The secretary 's phone buzzed softly , bringing him out of his reverie . She picked it up , listened for a moment , and hung up . Blake sat up and laid a hand on his folder . " l ) r . Fowler ? Admiral Simpson ? The President is ready for you now . " She got up from behind her desk to hold the door open for them . Blake could see the same blue carpet with its interwoven presidential seal , high-backed colonial chairs , marble-sided fireplace , flags , and paintings he 'd seen a hundred times before in TV newscasts . But it felt different in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walked into the Oval Office , the President got up from behind his desk and came to meet them . " Phil , it 's good to see you again . " He shook hands with the admiral and turned to Blake . " And you must be Blake Fowler . Mike Sinclair 's been telling me good things about you . " Blake heard himself mumbling something about hoping he deserved Sinclair 's praise . Then the President waved them both into chairs and settled back down behind his desk . He put his fingertips together below his chin . " Now , gentlemen , I 'm going to assume that this is more than just routine briefing . I 've only been here a couple of years , but I have n't yet had  | the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs come in to fill me in on the latest news from Lower Freedonia . " Blake glanced over at Admiral Simpson . The admiral nodded slightly . They 'd agreed earlier that Blake should take the first stab at explaining the situation . " Mr. President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interagency Working Group report you were shown before you signed the Korean sanctions bill . " The President frowned . Korea was obviously still a sore spot . Blake had seen some of the private messages that had passed between the White House and the South Korean government and could n't really blame him . Blake took a deep breath and pushed on . " The truth is , sir , that the document you saw had been altered . " " Hold it right there . " The President held up a hand and glared at him . He looked at his watch . " I 've got better things to do than listen to some goddamned staff squabbling . That 's what I pay my senior people for . If you 've got some beef with the way your copy got rewritten , take it up with Putnam or the chief of staff . Now let 's get on with the rest of your briefing . I 've got an important meeting in half an hour . " Blake could feel himself flushing . They could n't leave without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they ? He fought an urge to rearrange his notes . Anyway he looked at it , his days with the administration were numbered . Better to be damned for something he 'd done then for something he had n't . But would the admiral stick with him ? The admiral did . " With respect , Mr. President , Dr. Fowler and I are n't here to complain about the way a few words were changed here or there . " Simpson leaned forward in his chair . " We 're here because your national security adviser took it on himself to drastically alter the conclusions reached by the Working Group . I 'll be blunt . The recommendations you were shown bore about as much resemblance to what I and the other Joint Chiefs approved as horseshit does to roast beef . And that 's got direct consequences for this nation 's security . " The President looked up from his desk and Blake could see the curiosity In his eyes . Curiosity and something more . " Go on . " Blake asked him , " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The President nodded . " Then I think you ought to take a look at what the Departments of I ) efense and Commerce , the CIA , and the NSA all originally recommended . " Blake reached into his folder and pulled out several pages highlighted in yellow . " These are from the draft we submitted to Putnam . " The President reached over and took the papers out of Blake 's hand . He  | spread them out in front of him and started reading . They could see his frown growing deeper as he read . It took him just a couple of minutes to finish . He handed them back to Blake without a word and swiveled his chair around to look out the rain-streaked window toward the White House Rose Garden . Blake and the admiral exchanged glances . Now what ? The President swung his chair back around to face them . " Okay , gentlemen . That bastard lied to me . And I signed something I should n't have . I certainly would n't have done it if I 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Blake looked back at him . " The best thing , sir , would be to push Congress to repeal the sanctions . And as soon as possible . " The President shook his head . " Impossible . The House and Senate have gone out of regular session for the election , and the new Congress wo n't assemble until early January . " Simpson nodded his understanding . " But you could call a special session ? after the election . " " Not on your life , Admiral . " The President studied the wall behind the two men for a moment before continuing . " How do you suppose I 'd look going hack begging Congress to lift sanctions I could have vetoed in the first place ? " Neither Blake nor the admiral answered him , but he must have read their thoughts in their eyes . " Yeah . I 'd look like a clown . Like a regular Jerry Lewis stand-in . " The President snorted , " Okay , maybe that 's too damned close to the truth for comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just about kill my chances to accomplish anything else in this term . Clear ? " They nodded . " So . Short of making myself look like a walking jackass , what are my options ? " Blake and the admiral had come prepared to answer this question . The trouble was that they did n't have a hell of a lot to offer . Blake got up out of his chair without thinking . His days as a student teacher had taught him to feel more comfortable talking on his feet . " Well , sir , Barnes and his legislative strategists have crafted a very tightly written bill . It does n't leave much at all to your discretion . " " I 've seen the legal analysis , Dr. Fowler . Now tell me something I do n't know . " " Yes , sir , " Blake said patiently . The President might have heard some of what he was going to say before , but it was vital that he realize just how limited his options were . " Essentially , the sanctions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot . They 're almost certain to go into place because there just are n't any loopholes in the legislation for us to wriggle through . " The President interrupted him with a question . " Is n't there a possibility , however slim , that Seoul will make the political and economic reforms we 're looking for before the sanctions go into effect ? " " Anything 's possible , Mr. President . But our analysis rates that as the least likely outcome . " Blake started to pace . " Basically , the South Korean government rests on a very narrow knife 's edge between two small , but powerful , factions . On one side they 've got a hard-line element in their military . The current Seoul government had its origins in a military coup , so they know what can happen if the armed forces are n't happy with what 's going on . " He turned and walked back past the President 's desk . " Now on the other side of the equation , you 've got a small hard-core group of radical students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are socialists and they want things that the military and South Korea 's industrial conglomerates would find intolerable  --  virtual unilateral disarmament and reunification with North Korea . " The President nodded his understanding . " So they 've got no maneuvering room . The token reforms that the hard-liners in the military would accept wo n't be enough to placate Congress or their students . And the reforms demanded by Congress wo n't be acceptable to the military . " " Yes , sir , exactly . What 's worse , they probably would n't even keep the students out of the streets anyway . " " Shit . " " In a nutshell , Mr. President . " Blake started another circuit past the President 's desk . " The odds , then , are that South Korea 's booming economy is going to come to a crashing halt over the next couple of months as their exports dry up . That 's going to polarize the apolitical middle portion of the South Korean population . Some are going to side with the military hardliners , and some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shrugged . " Where South Korea 's internal balance of power will wind up is anybody 's guess . " " And we ca n't do a damn thing to stop any of this ? " The President 's question was almost plaintive . " Not this year . Not without a special session of Congress . " Blake came to a halt . " The best we can hope for is that South Korea will muddle through until sometime next year . Then you might be able to make a good case for lifting the sanctions on humanitarian grounds . By then , people here will have seen a lot of TV pictures of unemployment lines in Seoul , and they 'll have started missing Hyundai cars and Samsung televisions . " The President nodded slowly . " Yes . We 'd still face an uphill legislative fight in Congress , but at least I 'd hold the moral high ground . "  | Blake glanced at Admiral Simpson . The admiral took his cue . " There 's one thing wrong with that scenario , Mr. President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Phil ? " " It assumes that there will still be a South Korea left to concern ourselves with next spring . " Simpson paused and the President arched an eyebrow . " Go ahead , Admiral . You 've got my attention . " " Yes , sir . You see , while all of this is going on in the South , we 've got to worry about what 's going on up in North Korea . Kim I1-Sung and his generals are going to be rubbing their hands over the prospect of a badly weakened South Korea . And they 've been piling up the hardware to do something about it . " The admiral handed McLaren 's latest intelligence assessment to the President and waited while he skimmed through it . " Jesus , these people are n't fooling around , are they . " " No , sir , they 're not . Without our forces along the DMZ as a trip-wire deterrent , they just might be tempted to use some of those brand-new tanks , planes , and artillery pieces . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's order of battle . " I do n't see what we can do about it . The Barnes bill is damned specific there , too . No political reforms , no American troops . We 're going to have to pull them out . " Blake tensed . This was the crucial moment . He spoke softly , " Not necessarily , Mr. President . At least not until you 've had a chance to reverse the sanctions in the next Congress . " The President 's head snapped up . He stared straight into Blake 's eyes . " Just what are you proposing , Dr. Fowler ? " Blake chose his words with great care . " Simply this , sir . Unlike the trade provisions in the bill , there is a small opening in the legislative language requiring us to pull our forces out of South Korea . An opening that you might be able to exploit to keep our protective umbrella up long enough to try convincing Congress to find alternatives . " He stopped for a moment . The President 's eyes did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't set a specific timetable for our withdrawal , Mr. President . Instead , the language calls for a pull-out to be carried out , quote , as expeditiously as possible , unquote . " This was it . The President leaned forward in his chair . " So how does that language give me the leeway I need , Dr. Fowler ? " " I suggest that you interpret that demand as loosely as possible , sir . After all , withdrawing more than forty thousand combat troops , support personnel , and all their equipment is going to be a logistical nightmare . It 's bound to take time  --  several months at the very least . " Blake paused again and then pressed ahead . And a discrete suggestion from  | you to the commander responsible for carrying out the move , General McLaren , could ensure that those months were stretched to at least a year . A lot can happen in a year , Mr. President . At the very least we 'll have bought time for the South Koreans to adjust to a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in his chair , surprised to find that his hands were trembling slightly . He looked up to see the President studying him closely . " You are aware , Dr. Fowler , that you 've just proposed that I twist the wording of a law beyond all recognition . That I tell a senior military officer to ignore its clear meaning ? " the President said in a low , even tone . " Yes , sir . I know that . " The President turned to Admiral Simpson . " Phil , what do you think of this young man 's plan ? You know that there are people in Congress who 'd love the chance to crucify me if this thing leaks out . " Blake could see the admiral weighing his answer . " Mr. President , both of pis have sworn to uphold the Constitution . And both of us have sworn to defend the United States against all enemies , both foreign and domestic . What Dr. Fowler proposes seems to me to fall into a gray area between those t wo responsibilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this decision for you , sir . But I believe that it 's a risk worth taking . " The President sat quietly for several minutes after the admiral had finished speaking . Then , suddenly , he looked over at Blake . " Did you vote for me in the last election , Dr. Fowler ? " he asked . Startled , Blake never even considered lying . " No , sir , I did n't . " The President smiled thinly . " Hell . If you can be that honest , I guess I can trust you on this . " He slapped a hand down on his desk . " Very well , gentlemen . I 'll take your advice . Somebody gave me bad advice , worse than bad , and I made a mistake . We 'll delay our pull-out from South Korea as long as we possibly can , and use that time to try and correct the error . " He stared hard at them . " But I do n't want a single goddamned thing about this on paper . You understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " They nodded . " Great . " Simpson looked curiously at the President . " What about Putnam ? If you take any action against the lying bastard , his congressional patrons may guess that we 're up to something they 'd want to know about . " The President smiled grimly . " Do n't worry about Mr. Putnam , gentlemen . We 'll keep him on in his old job  --  at least as far as he and the outside world are concerned . But I 'll be goddamned if I ever believe a word that man says from now on . He 'll attend every national security meeting , but when he  | speaks , I 'm not listening . If I want to know something about this Korean situation , I 'll arrange a little private get-together for just the three of us . Clear ? " They nodded again . The President turned to Blake . " You know , Dr. Fowler , while this whole troop withdrawal thing is playing out , you 're going to have a keep treating Putnam as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is that going to be a problem for you ? " Blake shook his head . " Okay , then . That 's settled . " The President picked up the phone . " June , I want you to put together some travel arrangements for a member of my staff : Blake Fowler . Yes , I want him in Seoul by tomorrow , if possible . " I le hung up and smiled again at Blake . " No need to look so surprised , Dr. Fowler . I 'm making you my go-between with General McLaren on this thing . You 're going to be in it up to your neck . " Blake could n't think of anything to say except , " Yes , sir . I sure as hell will he . ' OCTOBER 25. - EIGHTH ARMY FIELD HQ , SOUTH KOREA The clattering , ear-splitting roar of the Cobra gunship 's rotor hammered through McLaren 's helmet as he looked out through the front windshield. 1 he ( : hra skimmed low over rice paddies as it raced toward a jagged ridge flanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following rising ground in a smooth curve to the left just fifty meters above a hillside orchard . Fallen leaves caught in the helicopter 's downdraft swirled high into the air in its wake . McLaren kept his eyes focused on the small valley they were rushing toward at a hundred and twenty knots . Without looking , he held up his right hand , palm forward . The chopper pilot obeyed his signal and eased back on his collective , slowing the gunship as they flew by the valley 's tree-lined entrance . McLaren studied the ground carefully , first with unaided eyes and then with a pair of binoculars as they orbited past the valley again . Nothing . Not a single radio aerial in plain view . Good , there were n't any telltale signs that might reveal his camouflaged headquarters to an airborne enemy . He pulled his head back into the cockpit and cut in his throat mike . " Okay , Jim . You can take us down now . I think I 'm getting airsick . " The pilot grinned at him and sketched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helicopter into a long slide up the valley toward a. small clearing . They settled in to land in a hail of rotor-blown dust , small pebbles , and dead grass .  | McLaren slid down out of the gunship , bent low holding his helmet , and scuttled out from under the slowing rotor blades . He straightened up and strode past a headquarters detail waiting with the netting to conceal his personal chopper from prying eyes . He returned their salutes and kept going down the path toward the tangle of tents and M577 command vehicles that marked his army 's " bare-bones " field headquarters . Bare bones , my ass , he thought , looking at the crowded vehicle park . Still , it was smaller than his predecessors ' traveling circuses . Doctrine said an army-level field HQ needed dozens of trucks , command trailers , and personnel carriers to operate properly . But McLaren knew that doctrine did n't mean diddley-squat if it made you a big , juicy , and obvious target for an enemy airstrike or artillery barrage . He preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the main command tent but then bent back down to their work . He 'd made it plenty clear early on in his tour that he did n't have time for a lot of meaningless saluting and ass-kissingespecially not in the field . His aide came up to take his helicopter crewman 's headgear . McLaren shrugged it off and took his old-fashioned steel pot in return . He did n't like the new , plastic-armored " Fritz " helmets prescribed by Army regulations . He 'd seen the studies showing they were more effective at keeping out fragments , but there was something unsettling about them nonetheless . He 'd told Doug once that a man needed to have steel on his head to feel secure under an airburst . " Damnit , " he 'd barked , " plastic 's only good for two things  --  model airplanes and some bimbo 's shopping trip . " He remembered that his aide had smiled gamely and packed McLaren 's new-style helmet away for good . Humoring him , no doubt . But what the hell , he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . McLaren settled the steel pot on his head and looked back at his aide . " That fella from Washington get here yet ? " " Yes sir , about half an hour ago . I 've got him waiting in your trailer . Do you want me to send for him ? " " Nah . Muhammad will go to the mountain this time . Keep an eye on things here for me , will you ? " McLaren climbed the steps to his command trailer and looked in through the door . The President 's highly unofficial " emissary " stood . McLaren liked the look of him . Tall , rangy , and with an open , honest face . Smart enough not to wear a suit out here , too . He nodded his head toward the hillside rising above the camp . " Let 's take a walk . " McLaren and Fowler hiked up through the tall grass far enough to be out of earshot of anyone else in the HQ . McLaren pulled his helmet off and turned to face Blake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake filled him in , speaking quickly at first but then slowing to emphasize  | each word as he got closer to the President 's " suggestion " that McLaren delay his planning for the congressionally mandated withdrawal from South Korea . When he 'd finished , McLaren stood silently for several minutes , looking out across the hill to the north  --  toward the DMZ . Then he shook his head in disbelief . " Jesus Christ , Dr. Fowler . I 've never heard anything like that in my whole friggin ' Army career . " Then he grinned . " But I 'm damned glad I finally got the chance to . " Fowler grinned back at him . The general had reacted just the way Admiral Simpson thought he would . " Just one question . Are we going to let the South Korean government in on this little secret ? " " No . The President does n't want any leaks on this . And he does n't want to blow any chance that the government here just might make the reforms Congress is insisting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on his head . " You go back to Washington and tell the President that he can count on the most screwedup evacuation planning process he 's ever seen . " They shook hands and headed back down the hill toward the headquarters of the Eighth Army .  | " luny felt like an idiot . It was foolish to feel this way , of course . He had traveled all the way to Seoul to get a second chance at being rejected by Anne Larson . Why should he feel foolish ? He knew she worked at the logistics agency as a computer programmer . The logical thing to do was go up to the headquarters building and ask where the computing facility was . Strangely enough , it worked . The corporal had looked at his out-of-place Air Force uniform a little strangely , then given him directions to building A34 . He walked out of the headquarters with a mix of excitement and anxiety he had n't felt since his last blind date in high school . Of course he had acted like an idiot in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously designed by a Westerner . They looked a little odd after all the Korean architecture he 'd seen , hut normal enough in this little island of America . The place was really jumping , with people and vehicles almost filling the sidewalks and the streets . The Logistics Computing Facility , building A34 , looked more modem than most . It was almost windowless , with a fortresslike air . He had to walk halfway around it to find an entrance . After a close inspection of his armed forces ID card , the front desk issued him a pass and gave him directions to " Miss Larson 's office . " They did n't ask his business , which was just as well . After leaving the reception area he went through a door marked AIRCONDITIONING BOUNDARY  --  KEEP CLOSED . The temperature dropped by ten degrees and there was a whirr in the air . The corridors were full of people in Army uniforms and civilian clothes . He started looking for Anne immediately , rehearsing what he was going to say . " Okay , Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it now . "  | The second floor was quieter , with carpeting instead of tile on the floor . He turned the corner into corridor C , wiping his palms . The first thing he saw was a receptionist 's desk , with a nameplate , but it was n't Anne 's  --  GLoRIA BURNS . Miss Burns looked up from a computer printout . " May I help you ? " " Uh , I 'm looking for Anne Larson , " Tony answered . " She 's supposed to be in room two ten . " The receptionist glanced at the phone board . " Miss Larson is on the phone right now . If you 'd like to wait , I 'll tell her you 're here . What did you need to see her about ? " Suddenly Tony felt his face getting warmer . " Ah , it 's personal . Just tell her Captain Christopher is here please , ma'am . " Ile saw Gloria 's eyes give him a once-over , and then she said , " Fine . Just take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area and Tony sat down . He watched Gloria 's departing form , which was not uninteresting , go toward a door . The plate next to it said A. LARSON  --  SUPERVISOR The Air Force did n't pay fighter pilots to be slow-witted . Anne was the boss ? lie quickly reevaluated his opinion of her , based on what little knowledge he had . He was a little ashamed that he had to raise it . " That will teach you , Saint , " he said to himself . " Never take a woman for granted . " Gloria was still standing in the door , talking in a low voice , about him no doubt . Ile could n't hear Anne 's reply , but her secretary ( Tony forced himself to think of Gloria that way ) came back and sat down . " It 'll just be a moment . " Then she went back to her printout . Tony glanced at his watch : eleven forty-five . At least his timing was good . He hoped to ask her out for lunch . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say yes , hut what the hell . He spent most of his time watching the phone board , and after about three or four minutes the light went out . Miss Burns looked up and said , " You can go in now . " Okay , boy , this is it . Sydney or the bush . He wiped his palms again , uncomfortably aware that the receptionist was watching him from the corner of her eye . He walked up to the open door and stopped short , knocking twice on the doorframe . " Come in . " It was Anne 's voice . She was sitting at an L-shaped wood desk covered with papers and printouts . She recognized him immediately . " I knew it . " She did n't look pleased . Tony smiled , looking a little like a child caught doing something he should n't . " I came to Seoul to see if you really . . . " The phone rang and Anne picked it up . " Larson . Yes , I know , I 've my two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked up at Tony , who  | was doing his best to look pleasant . " Listen , I should have something this afternoon . Is that soon enough for you ? I 'm a little busy now .... I know . I 'll call you back later . " She hung up and looked at Tony . " I 'm sorry , excuse me . This is not a good time , especially for personal visits . ' " " I 'm sorry if I said something wrong . I just wanted to see if you would like to go ? " A knock on the door stopped him . A man in shirtsleeves was holding a piece of paper . He said , " Oh , hi , " to Tony and looked at Anne . " Have you seen this memo ? " " Let me see it . " She stood up and walked over , took the sheet , and glanced at it . " Yes , Harry , I got one yesterday in my mail . It 's general routing . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Harry said as he left . She sat down heavily behind the desk , looking somewhat disgusted . " What were you saying ? " " Just that I wanted to talk with you some more , and I was hoping . . . " " Oh , God ! " Anne said softly , looking out the door . She smiled and waved at someone in the hall . Tony turned and looked . A middle-aged woman was pushing a coffee cart down the corridor , waving back . Anne , I know you said you did n't like to go out , but I thought maybe you 'd like to have lunch . I 'd really ? " " Sounds good . Let 's go . " She stood up and grabbed a largish purse off a corner of her desk . Tony stepped out of the way as she strode through the door , then followed . " Gloria , I 'm going out for some lunch , I should be back in an hour . " Her voice sounded normal , but Tony was puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant outing . " Okay , Miss Larson . Have a good time . " Gloria had a funny smile . What was going on here ? They strode down the corridor and stairs with Anne setting a fast pace . It reminded Tony of how she had moved during the riot . She was a little ahead of him , and he felt like an idiot , almost trotting trying to keep up with her . They went past the front desk and Tony dashed ahead to open the front door for her . This took a major effort , and as his hand pushed it open , he said , " I win . " She looked puzzled for a moment , but he went for it . " Oh , it 's okay , I like to jog before lunch . " They stepped outside and she seemed to relax . " I 'm sorry , I guess I was moving a little fast . I just wanted to get away from all those eyes . " Tony looked at her with a puzzled look . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . " They went down the steps . " I know a nice lunch place about a ten-minute walk from here . "  | " Anne , what do you mean about eyes ' ? Was it something I said ? " " Yes , Tony , but it 's not your fault . Gloria is head grape on the grapevine . She told me you said your business was personal . ' Two seconds after you went in my office half the floor knew I had a gentleman caller . That important memo ' Harry had to show me was about the coffee fund . " " Oh . Is that why you acted so odd later ? " She nodded . " And the lady with the cart . " " What about the lady with the cart ? " he asked . " Was she using the cart as a cover or something ? " " Oh , that 's her cart , but she works the main floor , not the second . " " I 'm sorry , I 've embarrassed you . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that , but I said on the subway I was n't interested in going out . The only reason I 'm here now is that you are the lesser of two evils . " She added , smiling , " Besides , you are kind of cute . " Tony blinked in surprise , but continued , " Whatever the reason , I do not consider riot the best place to meet people , but I liked your style . Why should it be such a big deal that I ask you to lunch ? " " Look , I just do n't go out a lot , and those bazoos will spend their lunch hour discussing us . " She stomped her foot as she walked . Tiny had a flash . " Why is it such a bad time at work ? " " The place is going crazy . My office maintains the software that tracks all logistical movements in and out of Korea . They 're doing things that the system was never designed for . Moving stuff in while they move the same stuff out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , Tony followed Anne to a small diner . It was a little crowded , but they found a table . Most of the clientele was Korean , which Tony took to be a good sign . " . . . they 're using the most inefficient schedules . I know they are brighter than that . Wait a minute . I 've been talking for five minutes . " " Yes , do you feel better ? You 're a lady who cares about her work . " " You let me blather on for five minutes ? I feel like an idiot . " " Would you like to order ? They 've got kalbichim . It 's pretty good . " " Why did you let me talk so much ? " " Look , Anne , you 're having a hard day ? " " Hard month , more like it . " " Fine . A hard month . I wanted to find out what was bothering you . And everybody likes to talk about their job . You already know what mine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She relaxed a little more , studying the menu . It was standard Korean fare , heavy on beef and fish , but spicy . She looked resigned . " I 'll just have pulgogi . " Tony frowned . " You do n't sound enthusiastic about the menu . Pulgogi 's just marinated beefsteak . You picked this place . Do n't you like Korean food ? "  | " I have n't had much besides pulgogi and a few other things . I guess I 'm not very adventurous . I really came here because nobody from my office ever comes here . " " Next time I 'll wear a bag over my head . " She giggled . " Stop that . I should n't be so upset , but ? " " It 's been a bad day . Yes , I remember . " Tony was pleased that Anne had actually laughed . " Can I make a few suggestions ? I 've tried most of the things on the menu at least once . I promise , nothing too exotic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more pleased , even curious . " What are you having ? " " Pibim-bap . It 's got eggs , rice , meat , beans , lots of stuff . It 's good , but it 's a little spicy . " " I 'll try it , too . " She studied the menu with more interest . Most of it was printed with Hangul characters , but alongside each dish was an English transliteration of the name . " What 's myolchi ? " Anchovies in a sweetish sauce . " " Yuck . " " No , it 's the old salt-and-sweet contrast . It 's not bad . " " I 'll pass . What goes well with pibim-bap ? " " Yonppuri . It 's lotus root in a sweet sauce . It helps kill the fire . " " Fine , let 's order . " While they waited , Tony found out that Anne had been in Korea for three months , working as the systems programming supervisor . " I was promoted in the States and brought over to fill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in charge of other people . " She frowned . " You do n't like it ? " Tony prompted . " I do n't know what to do . I 'm much more comfortable working with the computer . I guess I do n't work well with groups  --  certainly not leading a group . " " This is a bad time for learning management skills , " he agreed . The food came , and they ate and talked and laughed a little . They were both equally handy with chopsticks . Tony fought his desire to talk about flying , and instead they talked about Korea , and what they 'd seen , or not seen in Anne 's case . " I 've been completely wrapped up in my work , " Anne said . " Remember the riot ? That was my second trip downtown . My first was to the Kyongbok Palace . Nothing since early October . " " Anne , when the U.S. pulls out , you 'll go , too , and this is a beautiful country . I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't seen half of what I want to . The food , the art , the ? " " That surprises me . I thought fighter pilots just liked to fly and party . " Tony looked a little peeved . " I like both , but I do n't fly every day , and I do n't party every night . Uncle Sam paid my way over here , and there 's not  | to lot to do besides fly . I want to understand the country and the culture , at least a little . " " You 're right , " she said . " I 'm sorry . I guess I just do n't feel comfortable exploring the country . " " I think you just need some practice . I 've got a day off next weekend . I 'm going to visit an old ruined fort south of here . Would you like to come along ? It 's thousands of years old . " " I 'm so busy right now . I usually work on the weekends . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can just go after it 's over . " " Oh , there 's no deadline , I just normally work . " " Oh , well , please , take one day off and come out with me to visit the fortress . It 's not far , and there 's a good restaurant someone in the squadron told me about. , , " I really should see some of the country before I have to leave . I may even enjoy myself . " Tony assured her . " You will . "  | Iligh on a hill above the full-scale mock-up of a Korean town , General Chang watched the afternoon 's scheduled urban-assault exercise move toward its planned climax . The sharp rattle of automatic weapons fire mixed with the hollow trump of exploding grenades reached General Chang 's ears as he lay watching the assault blast its way into the village . He kept his binoculars focused on the lead platoon as it advanced up a narrow street . Yes , that was the way to do it . One squad back shooting the hell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close with the next house . The troops flattened against its walls while two men lobbed grenades in through doors and windows . Chang smiled as he saw the soldiers go in firing before the smoke from the grenades had even stopped billowing out of the building . Damn right . Charge in before the bastards inside had time to clear their heads . Without lowering the binoculars he said , " Make a note . Commend the first platoon . Give them a two-day pass . " His aide , crouching beside him with a pad and pencil , scribbled frantically , adding a new line to his tenth page of notes from this exercise alone . The general must be in a generous mood , he decided . For the conscript soldiers of South Korea 's army , a two-day pass was an almost unheard-of luxury . There 'd be a lot of celebrating in the barracks tonight , and General Chang , the soldier 's soldier , would see his popularity soar even higher . Chang swung his binoculars over to follow the other part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grenading their way deeper into the village . He watched and listened as the firing rose to an echoing crescendo and died away into a spatter of individual rifle shots . Then the firing stopped .  | " Tango One Five , this is Tango One One , " the radio crackled . Chang took the microphone held out by his radioman . " Go ahead , Tango One One . This is Tango One Five . " " The objective is secure . Repeat , the objective is secure . " Chang thumbed the mike switch . " Acknowledged . Assemble your troops in the town square . I 'm coming down . Out . " The colonel tossed the mike back to his radioman , stood up brushing the dirt off his uniform , and headed toward his jeep . He was pleased . The exercise had gone like clockwork , with the village cleared of its hypothetical North Korean or subversive defenders in less than forty-five minutes . Chang clambered aboard his jeep and settled back as it tore off down the winding , dirt road toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He threw his head back and let the cold air rush over him . Winter was coming on fast and they would have snow soon . He smiled . Many in the cities hated the winter , the icy north winds , the shorter days . But for farmers , the winter was a welcome time  --  a chance to rest from endless days spent laboring in fields and rice paddies . Chang had always liked the winter . His jeep , radio aerial whipping in the breeze , slewed around a street corner and braked in front of the infantry company assembled in the village square . " Attention ! " D company of his 1st Battalion straightened in a single fluid mot ion . Chang stood in his seat and returned their salute before jumping down out of the jeep . He strode over to the captain commanding D Company . " Fine work , Captain . Your boys looked very good . " " Thank you , sir . We 've been working them hard these past few weeks . " Chang knew that was true . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . That was n't surprising , given the chaos sweeping through the country . And if anyone had noticed that most of the extra combat training centered on urban fighting , well , they 'd kept their thoughts to themselves . He looked the company over carefully . Every man 's gear looked in good order and ready for use . These men looked tough and they 'd acted tough . He made a snap decision . D Company would lead the column into Seoul . He studied the captain , too . The man had a good record . His men obviously liked and trusted him . And he was known around the 1st Battalion officers ' mess as a rabid political hard-liner . He was just the kind of officer Chang was looking for . " Very well , Captain . You can dismiss your company now . " Then Chang held up a hand . " But before you do , you should let them know that they 've just won themselves a two-day pass . "  | He could see the front ranks smiling proudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who would fight for him when the time came . " Company ! Form in a column of twos and head for the barracks ! " The captain 's command roar cut through Chang 's thoughts . He turned hack to the man . " Oh , and Captain ? " " Sir ? " " Join me in my quarters this evening for a drink . We 've much to discuss , you and I. Be there at nineteen hundred hours sharp . " The man beamed . " Yes , sir ! I 'm honored , General . " Chang returned his salute and wheeled toward his jeep . He had other units to visit before this day was through . NOVEMBER 14 ? YONGSAN ARMY BASE , SEOUL , SOUTH KOREA McLaren stood at his window watching the tear gas rise above the city to the north . If Seoul 's politicians had thought the cold weather would end the rioting , they 'd been damned overoptimistic , he thought sourly . Instead of tapering off , the disturbances were spreading over all of South Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major industrial cities  --  Pusan , Taegu , and Taejon  --  were at a standstill . Of course a lot of that could be blamed on the American and European trade sanctions . Overseas buyers had started breaking their contracts even before the sanctions went into effect , not wanting to get stuck with lot of overtaxed , unprofitable merchandise when they did . As far as McLaren could tell , the only people who were going to benefit from this whole mess were the international trade lawyers who were being called in left and right . Certainly the sanctions were n't helping South Korea 's workers . Large-scale unemployment had been a thing of the past for Korea , but now more than ten percent of the work force had been thrown out on the streets . And the numbers were rising fast . Government projections showed a twenty percent unemployment rate by early December . The results were predictable , but McLaren did n't find any pleasure in having predicted them . The workers who 'd been tossed out on their ears , courtesy of the U.S. Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taking on an increasingly anti-American tone .
