A general introduction , courtesy Issey Miyake : " I make clothes . " A gentle caution : " We must not be too logical . " And an all-purpose question : " How do you think it ? " <P> " Issey , " asks a friend , standing in a bustling hotel lobby , " how do I work this ? " The friend is flapping about in the enveloping intricacies of a new raincoat . " I made it like this , " says the designer , improvising a fitting at the front desk . He unbuttons a half-cape that spans the sleeves and puts the loose ends around his friend 's neck . " Like a scarf , you see ? " <P> " But what about this ? " says a companion , trashing logic and pulling the cape over the friend 's head , buttoning it under the neck to make a watertight hood . The designer looks ; his head tilts . " How do you think it ? " his friend teases . <P> Miyake 's face creases into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Great ! " he says , grabbing his companion in a tight hug , as if some souvenir sphinx had suddenly surrendered a secret . To all the patrons in the hotel lobby , it looks as if old friends were reuniting at the end of a long trip ; in fact , any voyage with Issey Miyake is ongoing . " Next time I make like that , and you do something different again , " he laughs . " Always fresh , always different , always challenge . That way is best , I think . Want to eat ? " <P> In a minute , maybe . Meanwhile , it is worth pointing out that some strenuous modification of that lobby styling session has produced , over the past 15 &lt; years , some of the best clothes there are , some of the most adventurous anyone has ever done . These are clothes that defy convention by flowing all around it , like so many pieces of whole cloth finding fresh form in the controlled accident of the fall , making the body under them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has even experimented with molding the body underneath . Other designers working the same territory might just market a line of underwear . Not Miyake . He designs bustiers for intrepid evening wear out of motorcycle- helmet plastic and mounts a museum project called " Bodyworks , " which has appeared in Tokyo , Los Angeles , San Francisco and at London 's Victoria and Albert Museum . <P> Miyake 's clothes , declarations of independence for the body , do not look at all out of place on exhibit in museums . Yvonne Deslandres , curator of the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris , casts traditional French fashion jingoism aside and calls Miyake " the greatest creator of clothing of our time . " His designs challenge so many traditional expectations and break so many rules that they need different sets of standards to be understood or even worn . " I know many people resist or reject my clothing , because it 's not a package that 's already formed , like European clothing , " the designer will concede . " Without the wearer 's ingenuity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is left for wearers to make things their own . That may need courage at first , but once you get the trick , it 's not difficult . " <P> The trick , most often , is simplicity . What may be difficult is the attitude that the clothes need , and indeed can instill , once they are on the body , making with every movement of the arm or arch of the hip shapes full of gentle , sensual surprise . Miyake clothes on women are a revelation . On men , they are a relief . If most conventional clothing is , as the designer says , " a package , " then wearing Miyake feels like being unwrapped at Christmas .
