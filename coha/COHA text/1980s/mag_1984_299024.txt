THE GREAT CAT MASSACRE AND OTHER EPISODES IN FRENCH CULTURAL HISTORY <P> by Robert Darnton ; Basic Books <P> 298 pages ; $17.95 <P> The intriguing title is not a joke , nor is it an attempt to reach the Garfield market . It represents a searching effort to determine why a band of Parisian printers bludgeoned to death a lot of cats , notably including the master printer 's wife 's pet , then subjected several of the animals to a mock trial and hanged them . More important , why did these printers of the 1730s think the butchery was so comic that they guffawed as they re-enacted it in pantomime more than 20 times ? Was it sadism ? Mass hysteria ? Demonic ritual ? <P> The answers lie partly in the master 's mistreatment of his apprentices , who were made to work long hours and fed on rotten scraps that the pet cat refused to eat . They also lie partly in the popular tradition of torturing felines , which were widely associated with both sorcery and sexuality , and which were often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that funny ? By " accidentally " including the pet along with the alley cats , they were not only symbolically punishing the master but symbolically accusing his wife of witchcraft and symbolically raping her . And getting away with it . <P> That is a sample of the rich meanings Princeton History Professor Robert Darnton finds in the commonplaces of prerevolutionary France . He is exploring a relatively new branch of history , cross-fertilized by anthropology and known in France as l'histoire des mentalits . Says Darnton : " It attempts to show not merely what people thought but how they thought - how they construed the world . " <P> All this somewhat speculative re-creation of the ancien rgime is solidly based on Darnton 's mastery of its most obscure documents . He has discovered , for example , that there was a police official who spent the years 1748 to 1753 writing more than 500 still unpublished dossiers covering virtually every writer in Paris . They included all those troublesome philosophes whose skeptical criticisms of the Bourbon monarchy contributed to its downfall , yet this diligent police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a group , never imagined that any writers could have political importance . Woe to the ruler who relies too much on police intelligence . <P> The whole relationship between writing and reading in these prerevolutionary years was undergoing significant changes that reached beyond politics . Darnton endeavors to demonstrate the change from the letters that a young merchant in La Rochelle wrote to the bookseller who regularly sent him the new works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau . In Darnton 's view , Rousseau 's preachings first established " the author as Prometheus " and his readers as emotional disciples . Darnton also finds rich social implications in folk tales like " Little Red Riding Hood . " <P> He scorns the psychiatric interpretations of Perrault 's Mother Goose because he knows the 10,000 or so 19th century transcriptions of peasant versions of these same tales .
