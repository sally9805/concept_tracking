By noon the next day he was having a leisurely lunch with his wife , Hayat , at Kentuck Knob , their fortresslike Frank Lloyd Wright house in Chalk Hill , Pa. , about 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh . After a few days they moved on to another of their homes , Mies van der Rohe ' s glass-and-steel Farnsworth House in Plano , Ill. , 55 miles southwest of Chicago . They might instead have gone to their Chicago apartment overlooking Lake Michigan , in Mies ' s building at 880 Lake Shore Drive , or to their London town house , their Berkshire manor house or their six tiny islands in the Inner Hebrides , off the Scottish coast. // At the end of January , the Palumbos will have yet another choice , their latest acquisition : the Jaoul Houses designed by Le Corbusier in Neuilly-sur-Seine , near Paris. // As majolica might be to a more usual collector , houses are Peter Palumbo ' s passion . And logistics aside , he has come to cherish what he calls " the different way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one. " // " Like all great art , these houses have an apparent simplicity that could only be the distillation of a towering genius , " Mr. Palumbo said. // What makes the Palumbos ' three houses by the masters of modern architecture - Le Corbusier , Mies and Wright - even more intriguing is that he not only purchased them from their original owners but also restored them with the help of architects who had originally worked on the houses or grounds . And unlike the original owners , Mr. Palumbo has taken a purist ' s approach to the interiors by acquiring furniture and decorative objects by the architects . Mr. Palumbo , who is 54 years old , traces his interest in architecture to 1952 , when he was at Eton . He heard a talk by his house master on Mies , including a description of the newly completed Farnsworth House . " When I saw the photograph of the house , I was overwhelmed by its beauty , never dreaming that someday I would live there , " Mr. Palumbo said. // Following law studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-estate development company . In the 60 ' s , he invited Mies to design an office building for London ' s financial district , the City . This much-publicized project , which resembled the Seagram Building in New York , was finally rejected by the Environment Minister in 1985 . Prince Charles , in his first foray against modern architecture , had called it a " glass stump. " // In 1968 , on one of Mr. Palumbo ' s visits to Mies in Chicago in connection with the project , he saw an ad placed by Dr. Edith Farnsworth , who was selling the weekend house , a 77-foot-by-28-foot glass pavilion , that Mies designed for her in 1950 . He purchased it on the spot . The riverside setting of the Farnsworth House now resembles an English park with trees , wildflowers , daffodils and contemporary sculpture , thanks to extensive landscaping in the 70 ' s and early 80 ' s by the late Lanning Roper , an American who lived in England. // Since Mies and Dr. Farnsworth had a falling-out over the price of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Palumbo has collected many Mies originals , including his famous daybed and an X-based coffee table from the Barcelona Pavilion. // " It is a romantic house geared for two , with a Japanese feeling , " Mr. Palumbo said. // In April 1985 , after he was already living in one architectural icon , Mr. Palumbo planned an excursion to another : Fallingwater , the 1936 Frank Lloyd Wright house in Mill Run , Pa . " As powerful as my first visit to Chartres , " he described the experience of standing on a rock ledge and looking up at the waterfall and the house cantilevered over it. // Before the visit was over , he learned that Kentuck Knob , a 1954 Wright house only 8 miles away , was on the market . Again losing no time , he saw the house that afternoon : a massive rampart of native sandstone that rises more than 18 feet . He purchased it on a second visit. // The original owners , Bernadine and I. N. Hagan , recalled that Wright interviewed them at his Wisconsin headquarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular site , which overlooks a valley of the Chestnut Ridge , until after he had designed the house . A contour map of the knob was all he requested . When an apprentice finally did come to the site , the only change he made was to move the house 10 feet on the site plan. // There is not one right angle among the 53 corners in the one-level house , which like a medieval fortress wraps around a central courtyard . " To determine all the corners in the design , " Mr. Palumbo said , " the first contractor had to set up stakes and a network of strings in a configuration like a cat ' s cradle. " // Last fall was the Palumbos ' first in the house . With Wright ' s original dining-room table and fire grate - and with the original housekeeper still on the job - the place has the air of a house freshly built . In fact , much of it has been , after a fire gutted one wing four years ago . Now , the tidewater cypress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fretwork that screens the narrow strip windows and the carved wood canopy over the terrace , which has Indian motifs , are newly enhanced by Mr. Palumbo ' s collection of American Indian jars , bowls and baskets . All of the original rugs and fabrics have been reproduced , and their peach-buff color creates a quiet background for many other Wright pieces , including chairs , hassocks and lamps. // In muddy weather , Mr. Palumbo is quick to don a pair of Wellingtons , from a dozen pairs lined up by size for guests , and give a tour of the woodland setting , with dogwood and laurel and a ground cover of vinca , periwinkle and primroses . As in many Wright houses , the terraces seem to be extensions of the interiors , with only glass walls , angled to appear invisible , as dividers . The 1959 greenhouse on the grounds originally belonged to Fallingwater. // " As it is a late house by Wright , Kentuck Knob is a kind of summation of his work , " Mr. Palumbo said , " and because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good place to spend winter weekends. " // Next month , the Palumbos will move into the Jaoul Houses in Paris : two three-story houses designed by Le Corbusier in 1954 for two generations of the industrialist Andre Jaoul ' s family . The raw exteriors of rough concrete and brick come as a surprise on the leafy suburban side street in Neuilly. // Joined by an underground garage , the houses are rich in Corbusian vocabulary : Catalan brick vaults , after Antoni Gaudi ; walls in primary colors , and Cubist window walls with panels of wood or brick alternating with panes of clear and frosted glass . Jacques Michel , an architect whose office is only blocks away , supervised the restoration , much of it by the same firms that built the house. // Le Corbusier ' s own hand can be seen clearly in his admonition written on the white tile floor : " Attention . Never wash this tile floor with abrasives . June 1954 L-C. " // Sprouting on the dirt-covered arched roofs are what Le Corbusier planned as true wild gardens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild grasses , irises and marguerites . But the Palumbos are not counting entirely on chance . On a recent visit they planted 750 daffodil bulbs on the front lawn. // In Paris recently , the Palumbos consulted the designer Charlotte Perriand , who collaborated on furniture with Le Corbusier in the late 1920 ' s . The couple bought one of her tables at an auction in Monte Carlo , and she will advise them on arranging and refining the interiors . The built-in cabinetry is still in place , and the Palumbos have added oak tables and captains beds after original Le Corbusier designs. // The Palumbos are sending over everything else . " We are only permitted to bring in one shipment of household furnishings duty-free from England , so I am bringing everything I can think of , including the kitchen sink , " Mr. Palumbo said. //
