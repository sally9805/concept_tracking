 | At age 67 , John Forsythe considers himself multiply blessed : Thanks to his role of Blake Carrington in the ABCTV series Dynasty , he is earning more money than ever before in a long , rewarding career . His 41-year marriage to the former Julie Warren remains steadfast , and they have moved into their dream house . He is proud of his three children . His health is robust and he finds time to pursue his interests in ecology , wildlife , liberal politics , and charitable causes . Six years ago the outlook was far different . " I had started to feel strangely fatigued , " John recalled . Electrocardiograms and stress tests revealed nothing unusual . Nor did tests for diseases he might have picked up in the exotic places he visited filming The World of Survival , the wildlife series he was doing at the time . Then , in 1979 , his doctors had him walk a treadmill while they traced a fluid that had been injected into his veins . " It turned out that I have rather small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . " I was faced with the risk of something rather dire happening ? a serious heart attack when I was working late , playing tennis , or whatever . " I might have lived another fifteen or twenty years without any trouble . But . . . faced with what they told me , I felt there was no choice . I 'm not a fellow who enjoys living tentatively . " With Julie 's concurrence , John decided to undergo quadruplebypass surgery to correct the problem . After the operation he recuperated for one day in intensive care , the next he was back in his hospital room working crossword puzzles with the nurses . Within  | eight days he was allowed to go home and two weeks after the operation he was hitting ground strokes on the tennis court . Today he takes no medication and leads an active life , though ever mindful of his doctor 's comment : " I did n't cure you , John ; I corrected your condition . " He was born John Lincoln Freund in Penn 's Grove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plant of the DuPont company , where his father was an executive . John was 11 when the family , including a younger brother and sister , moved to New York . While their father worked on Wall Street , the Freund children grew up in the comfort of affluent suburbia . John attended public schools and then won an athletic scholarship to the University of North Carolina . " I was a baseball player of very modest talents , " he said . " Though I was never a star athlete , I was willing and gutsy . I played relief pitcher and shortstop , and my batting average just about equaled my hat size . " In his junior year John quit school to take a job as public-address announcer for the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team . His father ? who was so conservative that his office walls were hung with portraits of Warren G. Harding , his favorite president ? wanted John to attend West Point . He arranged a meeting for John with a senator , hoping the politician would appoint him to the academy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think he wanted an Army career . Next Mr. Freund urged his elder son to follow him to Wall Street . John has never forgotten his father 's reaction when he announced that he wanted to be an actor : " There was a long pause ? a long pause . I waited for the roof to fall down , but nothing happened . So I said , ' How do you feel about that ? ' Another pause . Then my father said , ' I 've never worried about you , John . I worried about your sister and your brother a little bit . But I knew that no matter what you did , you were going to be all right . But I am worried now ! ' " He told me , ' You do n't look like an actor ; you do n't act like an actor ; you do n't sound like an actor . You 're just a nice fellow . You do n't have a deep , rumbling voice , you do n't wear your coats over your shoulder or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to explain to him that all actors did n't look and sound like John Barrymore . " His father grudgingly tolerated John 's ambitions , and his mother was " enormously supportive of anything I wanted to do , " John said . " She was a bright , lovely woman , who , incidentally , could n't cook to save her life . " John had a friend at a New York radio station , with whom he wangled an audition . After hearing young Forsythe 's delivery of speeches from Cyrano de Bergerac and O'Neill 's Beyond the Horizon , the friend declared , " That 's the worst audition I 've ever heard ! You 've got a pleasant , strong voice but you do n't know from A to B about acting ! " John asked , " Are you trying to tell me that what I need is training ? " " No , " the friend replied , " what you need is talent . I advise you to stick to sports . " Devastated , John rode the subway home , growing angrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you judge a person who has no training ? Is acting so difficult that only a handful of people in the world can do it ? " Shortly after this episode he read a newspaper ad offering " free acting les-  | sons for young men , " and he responded . The acting school had an overabundance of women students and needed young men to play scenes with them . It was while he was at the acting school that John decided to take the stage name of Forsythe from his mother 's side of the family . At drama school John met pretty Parker McCormick , one of the paying students . She was a talented harpist as well as an actress . They fell in love , married , and spent their honeymoon touring the country with a children 's theater troupe . They traveled as far as Oklahoma , with John driving the scenery truck , serving as assistant stage manager , and acting small roles . Not long after the tour was over , Parker gave birth to a son , Dail , but unfortunately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The trouble was that we were both young idealists , not realists , and we were n't able to adjust to the normal problems of living together , " John said . B ack in New York , he faced the actor 's usual struggle for work . " Early on in my career , I augmented my meager acting income by modeling , " he recalled . " I was registered with the Harry Conover agency , and I modeled mostly clothing . I posed for the Sears Roebuck mail-order catalogs and for photographic illustrations for magazine stories . The pay was fifteen dollars an hour ? awfully good in those times . But I got out as soon as the acting jobs started coming . " He began getting parts in popular radio soap operas such as The Romance of Helen Trent and Stella Dallas . He also appeared in Broadway plays and in due course was offered a movie contract with Warner Bros . Though he had no real interest in films , he wanted to earn money for his former wife and son because with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going into the service . John played small roles in Destination Tokyo ( starring Cary Grant ) and Northern Pursuit ( starring Errol Flynn ) before entering the Army Air Corps . " While I was still under contract to Warner 's , " John remembered , " I appeared in some films Frank Capra was making for the Army Air Corps , as it was called then . So when I was called into the service , I naturally chose the Air Corps . " John wanted overseas duty but was instead ordered to join the Air Corps show , Winged victory , written by Moss Hart and starring Air Force personnel . He appeared in the show for a year and a half , then taught wounded airmen how to regain lost speech : " One of the most satisfying periods of my life , " he said . John met his second wife while he was still in Hollywood before his Air Corps service . An actress he knew , K.T. Stevens , kept telling him , " I 've got a girl who 's just right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talented young actress . K.T. was also telling Julie , " I 've got a boy who 's just right for you . " Finally K.T. invited them both to a party at her house , and Julie and John fell in love . But with war service facing him , John resisted any suggestion of marriage . " Julie followed me all across the country , insisting that I marry her , " John claimed . " I kept saying no , but I could only hold out so long . " Julie Forsythe interjected , " John told me , ' I 'm not the marrying kind , ' and that was a challenge I could n't resist . " " I 'm still not convinced I 'm the marrying kind , " John @#  | said . " My ideal existence would be to be married part of the time and not married part of the time . But I ca n't sell Julie on that . " The two were married in December of 1943 in New York , where John was appearing in Winged Victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee . When the war was finally over , John decided not to return to Hollywood . " I had this half-baked idea that I wanted to be a stage actor , " he said . He figures his career began to really get off the ground after he became a founding member of the Actors Studio in 1947 . Among the students then at the famed academy : Marlon Brando , Montgomery Clift , Maur- een Stapleton , Karl Malden , and Julie Harris . " It was a wildly stimulating place for a guy like me who never suspected there was that kind of artistry and psychological approach to acting . It helped me grow in a lot of ways . I had come from a rather stiff background . I have always thought if I had n't been part of the Actors Studio ? if I had n't become an actor ? I would have been a very stiff fellow . " As John 's career began to progress in the theater and live television drama , Julie decided to quit acting to start their family . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brooke in 1954 ? and Julie never returned to performing . Asked if she had any regrets , she replied , " Oh , I have a few pangs when I see a Broadway musical . But John 's career was blossoming , and I was so thrilled with being a mother that I never went back . After the girls were grown , I went into decorating , and I 've found that gratifying . " An important role in Broadway 's All My Sons led to John 's challenging assignment of following Henry Fonda in portraying the lead in Mister Roberts . Then came John 's own Broadway starring role in The Teahouse of the August Moon . Though he lost the movie version to Glenn Ford , he won another film prize : Alfred Hitchcock 's The Trouble with Harry . In 1956 a TV comedy series was proposed for John in which he would portray a swinging Beverly Hills lawyer with an Oriental houseboy . " I said , ' It seems like a good idea , but I think it needs something more , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a young niece that his sister asked him to care for ? ' " Revamped and retitled Bachelor Father , the series was scheduled to be introduced on General Electric Theater , hosted by Ronald Reagan . For the part of the niece , the producers tested several 13-year-old girls and finally made a choice . John was discussing the final plans with the producers one day when Ronald Reagan stormed into the office . " Is that the girl you 're going to have for the show ? " Reagan demanded . " There 's only one girl you should use ? Noreen Corcoran , the fat little girl with the freckles . She 's the one to get ! " The producers followed Reagan 's advice ? and Bachelor Father enjoyed five prosperous seasons . By now the Forsythes had become confirmed Californians . John followed Bachelor Father with two less successful series , To Rome With Love and The John Forsythe Show . He also appeared in such films as The Ambassador 's Daughter ( with Olivia de Havilland ) , Madame X ( with Lana Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I always chose very dramatic roles in films to get away from my Smiling Jack ' roles in television , " Forsythe commented .  | He was certainly removed from " Smiling Jack " in the 1979 film And Justice for All with Al Pacino . John was cast as an outwardly respectable judge with a penchant for beating up women . " I do n't believe I ever would have been considered for Dynasty if I had n't played that role in And Justice for All , " he said . Dynasty was concocted in 1980 as ABC 's answer to the titanic success of Dallas . " The producers really did n't know what they wanted , " John recalled . " They talked to me about playing Blake Carrington like J.R . Ewing , but I said , ' I do n't want to play J.R . Part of my strength as an actor is that I 've learned when you play a villain , you try to get the light touches ; when you play a hero , you try to get in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers : " Blake Carrington is the kind of guy who would have had John Kennedy shot in Dallas . " " Then we 're very far apart , " John told them . " I 'm not going to be on your show if that 's what you insist upon . I will play Blake as tough ? even ruthless ? in the marketplace . But he is not the kind of man who would have Kennedy killed . " John envisioned Blake Carrington like tycoons he had known : " Murderers when it comes to business , but the complete opposite at home ? they adore their wives and children and are pillars of the community . " The producers agreed to try it John 's way . From that moment on Dynasty became a viable project for Forsythe . After an uncertain beginning , the series found its mark with the viewing audience , and the ratings began to climb . John has brought believability to the sometimes absurd goings-on among the overprivileged ? and in the process of doing so has found himself proclaimed a sex symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife , my daughters ? and myself , " he said . Still vigilant about the character of Blake Carrington , John remains enthusiastic about Dynasty . He termed the cast , " the most generous , unselfish , and cooperative group of actors I 've ever worked with . " About Joan Collins : " She 's complex , but so am I. I find her straightforward , with a marvelous sense of humor . If you make her laugh , make her see where she 's peculiar , she 's a joy to have around . " About Linda Evans : " She 's truly an exceptional girl . " Today Julie and John Forsythe live in a roomy , exquisitely decorated ( by Julie ) home in a rustic canyon near Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades . After their daughters had grown , the couple decided to sell the Bel Air house they had occupied for 24 years and build a new one . It took five years to complete because the Forsythes felt the contractors did n't abide by their agreement . Lawsuits were filed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of the Forsythes . D all , John 's son by his first wife , is 44 , a former aide to Robert Kennedy , and is now a senior vice-president in a Wall Street brokerage house . John has two daughters . Page , 34 , is a nurse , now separated from her husband . She has a two-and-a-half-yearold daughter who , John admitted , " rules this house , her grandfather and grandmother . " Brooke , 31 , has worked for Henry Fonda and Norman Lear and in production jobs . " I feel I 've been a pretty lucky fellow , that I , a man with modest talents , have come this far , " John concluded . " But acting alone is not the most important thing in my life . My family , my friends are very important . I would like to do marvelous things with my acting , but if it does n't happen , it does n't happen . I 'm still enjoying a full life . " When you have a brush with mortality , as I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , " things change for you . You have a somewhat better perspective on life . I think I 'm a better guy in many ways now than I was before . "
