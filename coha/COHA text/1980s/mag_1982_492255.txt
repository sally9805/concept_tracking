Richard M. DeVos is that rare human equation  --  the classic Renaissance man in a 20th-century environment . His multicareers , into which he throws himself with such verve and panache , most observers would find merely awesome , even when taken singly : internationally renowned business executive , community leader , athlete , health devotee ( he swims a brisk 80 laps every day in his own pool , or wherever he may be within flailing distance of water ) , deep-water yacht-racing skipper , jet pilot , philanthropist and a smattering of other virtuoso roles . He is a celebrity in his quiet way , even among the people we know as celebrities , via Hollywood , Wall Street or Washington . He is a philosopher with a sense of humor  --  an erudite man who knows the power of simplicity . He is , indeed , a man to know gladly . It would be unfair to say that there is an actor hidden away in all these facets , yet there is something undeniably dramatic about him as he addresses , at the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesmerized by his speeches . When he arrives to greet an audience , the thunderous applause , whistles and foot stomping must be seen to be believed . The decibels exceed the joyous clamor of the most enthusiastic national political convention after having nominated their next U.S. presidential candidate . The United States , indeed , is filled with people who firmly maintain that Rich has the potential to be president . The suggestion has come to his ears , and Rich handles it with his usual throwaway deftness , " I 'll run if Jay will serve the term . " He is referring to Jay Van Andel , cofounder and co-owner of the billion-dollar Amway Corporation and Rich 's lifelong friend , ally , neighbor , partner-in-arms and buddy-by-choice since they were kids together in Grand Rapids . One guesses that Rich believes Jay would make a great president of the United States . When approached , Jay 's jocular retort would undoubtedly be , " I 'll serve the term if Rich will run . " So close is their relationship that Reader 's Digest has dubbed them " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said by someone pondering the miraculously rapid growth of their enterprise that , in theircase , 1 + 1 = 11 . Modest and affable in his manner , Rich is an easy winner in one-on-one encounters as well as in his dynamic personal effect upon huge groups . Witness to Rich 's personal warmth is Lucian Lupinski , the artist who painted the DeVos portrait on the cover of this issue . Lucian was somewhat apprehensive of the approachability of his subject as he traveled to Florida to intercept DeVos for their sittings . " I wondered how to reach a man of his position , " says Lucian , " because that communication is important to my portrayal of him . But I need never have worried . He immediately put me at my ease ; so much so that I felt I had known him for years . I was won over by the man himself . When I left , I went away feeling that I would like very much to keep on knowing him , after just this one encounter . " Artist Lupinski 's experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including myself . He is democratic in the purest sense : He addresses the guard at the White House in the same way he talks to " The Man " inside . There is a kind of grace about DeVos that reduces the sum total of all his personality to one simple common denominator . That is his humanity . The outer aspects of his inner enrichment are detailed elsewhere in this issue , but some deserve mention here : his remarkable rise in business after an adventurous youth in the Air Force and as skipper of a schooner he sailed into oblivion in the waters off Cuba ; his recent triumphs in navigation as skipper of a racing yacht , the 48-foot Wind-quest , in the annual Chicago to Mackinac Island yacht race , when the DeVos team placed first in its division in 1979 and took second place in 1980 , competing with 280 other vessels in all ; the success of a book he wrote , Believe , so inspirational that it is still in wide demand seven years later , a bestseller in the hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hundreds of thousands of the Amway Distributors , who played Pygmalion in reverse and contributed funds to have a bronze life-sized statue of Rich ( and one of Jay ) created by sculptor Charles Parks , to make sure their affection was adequately expressed during his lifetime . Rich and Jay 's scientific foresight in manufacturing stone-mill products ( offering the public a " home-baked , stone-ground loaf of whole-wheat bread " ) decades ahead of the current interest in quality high-fiber foods is matched by one of the original Amway basic products  --  the nutritional food-supplement , N utrilite , which Rich himself still takes daily . Rich has a trunkful of service awards as well as honorary doctorates . But perhaps as indicative of his clout as any is the " Excellence in Manage-ment " Award given him by Industry Week , the prestigious business mag-azine that selected him over such finalists as the chairman of U.S. Steel and the chairman of Mobil Oil . The award characterized him as a " business philosopher who has mastered the art of com-munication " ? perhaps as neat a thumbnail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life for the simple virtues that were implanted in him during his upbringing in Grand Rapids  --  patriotism , faith and devotion to family . He brings to his family life some of the unquenchable fervor and delightsome call it style  --  that is part of everything he does . He takes his mother to Washington where she meets President Ronald Reagan at the White House , and understandably , she is overwhelmed with pride , although to Rich it is something of a lark and a special gesture to show his pride in her . In this day and age Rich and his wife , Helen . still have an aura of romantic love about them , after 29 years of marriage . They are the parents of four children  --  three sons and a daughter . The oldest , Richard , Jr. , 26 ; who with his wife , Betsy , has just presented Rich with a grandson Richard M. ( Ricky ) III , is with Amway . Daniel George DeVos , 24 , is two years into his own training at Amway . His wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , was in the graduating class of ' 82 at Hope College , Holland , Michigan . Douglas , 17 , was graduated from Grand Rapids Christian High School . It is a close-knit group and always has been , and Rich and Helen work hard to keep it that way . The DeVos family lives in the village of Ada , Michigan ( a suburb of Grand Rapids ) , overlooking a little lake sired by the waters of the sweetly named Thornapple River and the grandly named Grand River , which conjoin at this point . Only a jogging distance away is the enormous manufacturing/laboratory plant of Amway , a handsome complex on the other side of Route 21 , about 10 miles out of Grand Rapids . Helen DeVos recalls her student days at Calvin College , a local church-related , liberal-arts col-lege , and the family background she describes as " a world of preachers and teachers and very different from the business world in which I am involved . " Into that quiet pastorale , Rich orchestrated a whirlwind courtship that she found breathtaking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for an airplane ride . He flew it . That was different ! On one of our early dates , Richard asked me to the symphony . I was aware that was n't his big thing , but he knew that I enjoyed it . It was marvelous . I adored the whole evening , and then afterwards , he had a gift for me : the records of the music we had heard  --  which was so thoughtful . I was really impressed with him . " The glow has lasted . Family activities are a staple on the DeVos social calendar . When the kids were young , Rich compensated for his frequent absences by taking them along , one at a time , on busi them , gone to their ball games . We are a close family ; we do a lot of things together . " An interesting facet in Rich 's personality emerges on the wings of a documentary motion picture on his life put out by Gospel Films . As the showings proliferate , Helen DeVos has been asked to appear on stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has been so glowingly successful in this role that it is now inevitable that she is surrounded by admirers and autograph seekers after each show is over . This is an entire reversal of their usual roles : Rich had long been at the center of the congratulatory afterdoings , while Helen waited quietly and patiently in the wings for the crowds to leave so that she could rejoin him . Now , to his amusement , their roles are sometimes reversed at the premiere showings , and it is Rich who waits while Helen is still greeting her own fans . A close look shows him glowing with pride in Helen 's performance . That early tactical gambit of Rich 's in classical music during their courtship has taken more serious roots in his interests in the years to follow . Helen has served on the board of the Grand Rapids Symphony for almost 10 years , and both she and her husband are now leaders in the Grand Rapids cultural community . They are pa-trons of the city 's DeVos String Quartet , and the dazzling new 2,500-seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their honor . Though an admit-ted nonmusician , DeVos has even been called upon Continued on page 116 continued from page 59 to perform with the symphony ? reading the narration in Aaron Cop-land 's familiar " Lincoln Portrait " to rave reviews ( " dramatic ... poignant " ) from the local music critic . The DeVoses have long been aggressive boosters of the Grand Rapids community and are regarded , along with their friends the Van Andels , as being among the prime movers in the " Renaissance " of the city 's downtown area in 1981-82 . Community activities , yes ; tennis , skiing , whatever . But there is also an active religious involvement that the family shares . Prayer and scripture reading at mealtime is an invariable DeVos custom ( Proverbs are favorites with Rich ) . " It 's always been our tradition to open our meals with prayer and close with Bible reading , " Helen explains . " That tradition is one we were brought up in , and one we 've continued with our families . Whether we are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The family has long attended the LaGrave Avenue Christian-Reformed Church in Grand Rapids . Rich has served on the board of Home Missions of his denomination and on the boards of several other religious denominations . He is in much demand as a speaker at Christian meetings around the country . ( The Rev. James Kennedy 's Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Ft . Lauderdale , Florida , and the Rev. Robert A. Schuller 's Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove , California , are active outposts of his . ) He speaks unabashedly of a " personal relationship with God . " Rich eloquently comments on his personal commitment . To him , all of life and its parts are in-separable : " This is an exciting world . It is cram-packed with opportunity . Great moments await around every corner . It is a world that deserves an upward look . We have heard enough from the critics , the nay-sayers , the cynics whose vocabularies have not progressed beyond the word ' no , ' the rip artists whose talents of seeing sore spots have made instant experts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large ' yes ' and a small ' no . ' I believe that life is good , that people are good , that God is good . And I believe in affirming every day that I live , proudly and enthusiastically , that life in America under God is a positive experience . ?
