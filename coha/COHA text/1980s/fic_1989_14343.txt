The interior of the Victory Theater on Forty-second Street . Audience on stage , within the gloom of the empty house . We spy the FIRST GIRL in a puddle of light , then the SECOND GIRL nearby . The FIRST GIRL is playing cat 's cradle . They speak in whispers . FIRST GIRL and they buried the gold they stole from the drunken knights of olden times ; they buried the loot out back under the outhouse or apple tree ; and craftily hid their crimes ; they heaped up and hoarded and spoilt everything they touched . They reared up banks and factories and fenced in the common lands , as though this were their right . They plotted and schemed and connived all down through the ages . Aside from all the ruin they visited upon the poor , the unemployed , the hungry , and their mothers , sisters , and wives , they brought nothing into the world but cunning , the mindless , heartless hoarding of wealth and property and the fruits of other people 's labor ; and grotesque bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious idiocy , the armaments industries , the slaughter in the Philippines , Africa , all over . Pause.That 's the long and short of it . SECOND GIRL Father Gallagher will have a thing or two to say about your reasoning , I imagine . FIRST GIRL The devil scratch his hump on the hook of Father Gallagher 's nose . p. 3 SECOND GIRL You ought to consider the state of your immortal soul , sister Jennie . FIRST GIRL And there are some books you ought to read , Mary . Dark , deep books full of the truth . Marx , Proudhon . Pause.They closed the theaters , too , you know . In England . After the death of Elizabeth the Great . SECOND GIRL But who will help me ? Father 's a drunkard . Poor Willie can not dress and feed himself . And mother FIRST GIRL I promise to send money from Germany . The Socialists care about common folk like us . Only you must promise not to read the jingoist newspapers any more . And you must n't say a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SECOND GIRL Funny mistake indeed ! A whistle from the darkened wings . FIRST GIRL Just a moment , Archie . SECOND GIRL Why did you call me Esther ? You 're Esther . A puzzled pause.I 'm Cecile . As for Mary , she 's dead . A ghostly cry from the CHORUS . Blackout . Music and slide show . A middle-aged MAN enters , well-dressed in turn-of-the-century clothes . p. 4 MAN Where is she ? Where is she , in heaven 's name ? and what are you staring at , miscreants , the lot of you ! I know she 's in here , I saw her dart in just as intermission began . She has purposely evaded me and her mother , and avoided my authority . In heaven 's name , a theater is no place for a young girl , as everyone who is anybody knows . Where is she , by God , tell me ! One of you must have seen her enter these premises only a few moments ago . For I was behind the upper balcony and forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , for I knew she would make for this place , for I have read her secret diary also , and perused its contents ; therefore I am apprised of her plans . Motivation is the key to unraveling the secrets of human nature . MR . RIOSO has appeared behind him . The dead CHORUS also appears in the house-right aisle . MR . RIOSO Welcome to the theater . Perhaps you wonder why things are arranged so queerly . The people there , dead . The place empty and deserted , the faint tingle of an unknown alarm , a strange scent of bad deeds long ago accomplished , an evil and sarcastic tinge to the air , the peculiar sensation of a barely perceptible fluttering of wings and paradoxes . All these uncanny effects are of the nature of the place . All of this is for you , Mr. Pretzel . All of this , all . He gestures widely . The CHORUS begins a slow soft-shoe , chanting . p. 5 CHORUS Time is empty air . Pause.To be or nobody . Pause.All theaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody knows that . MAN How the devil did you know my name ? Maybe I have made a mistake . Perhaps in my nervous state I have entered the wrong theater . MR . RIOSO No , Mr. Pretzel , you have not entered the wrong theater . This is opening night for Sag Harbor , a drama by James A. Hearn , the inaugural production in this , the Theater Republic , Mr. Oscar Hammerstein 's new house . Both Misters Hammerstein and Hearn have just addressed the audience , in eloquent and conversational terms , the former regarding his hope for his new theater , that it be dedicated to pure and noble things ; the latter , in order to express his hope that his new play draw well in New York . The day is the twenty-seventh of September , nineteen hundred . The weather is fair and mild , the winds shifting gently from the northerly to the southerly . Pause . Pretzel regards the CHORUS as it chants . MAN Sir . I know perfectly well who I am , and where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know is who you are , though to be frank I care not a pin ; or where my daughter is , whom I fear for , in this wild , outlandish place ; and for her honor , which is mine also , and for the state of her nerves , which are delicate , as she is easily rattled , high-strung , and subject to fits. * As was her mother , my wife . p. 6 MR . RIOSO I am Mr. Rioso , and your daughter , Cecile , is there , high in the second balcony . CHORUS stops . MAN looks up . The GIRL appears . Smiles . MAN Cecile . It 's your father . Will you come home ? FIRST GIRL No , Father . MAN And why not , pray tell ? FIRST GIRL Because I 'm dead , Dad . MAN What in the name of heaven does she mean ? VEILED WOMAN appears in lower box left . With a candle . FIRST WOMAN Do n't you recall , Horace , how bitterly you teased her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , telling her she was adopted , and that we would return her to Germany , from whence she came , from the foundlings ' hospital at Darmstadt , forever a foreigner , with no American citizenship , except in her heart ? MAN Who the devil are you ? FIRST WOMAN Your wife , Matilda , Horace . Whom you chained to the floor , yes , chained for five long years to the floor , at West Eighteenth Street , where we lived . Till my mind went awry , and I became , for all purposes , a raving maniac . A soul lost to reason . Do n't you recall who I am , Horace ? p. 7 MAN Dimly . The memory is not distinct . The GIRL pipes up . She 's closer now , leaning over the balcony . FIRST GIRL You claimed you chained Mom to the floor because of her passionate addiction to opium and other intoxicants . But you know very well that you chained Mother to the floor because she objected to your treatment of sister Mary 's suitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intelligent lad , gainfully employed as a cutter and polisher of diamonds at Louis Strasburger and Sons , of Maiden Lane . For when Philip begged for Mary 's hand you pointed a large , double-barreled shotgun at him , and swore venomously , so he dropped to the floor in a dead faint , and never recovered . Poor boy , he died some weeks later in the facility at Elmira , where madness is on the rise . Do you tell me you do not remember these events ? Do you , Father ? MAN What on earth are you talking about ? I have never heard of any Philip Sutton , and everybody knows that Jennie died two months ago , a dreadful suicide by an overdose of medicine . Enough medicine to kill two grown men . A YOUNG MAN enters . YOUNG MAN And who do you think the baby was who was cut to bits with an axe and disposed of in the East River earlier that day , you bloody poltroon ? p. 8 MAN Who the devil are you ? YOUNG MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN Who the hell is Frank Moore , that I should know him ? YOUNG MAN I am your son . MAN I have no son . YOUNG MAN You have one now , you cad . MAN I have none , I swear on it . YOUNG MAN I am your son-in-law . For sweet Jennie and I were married . Secretly , at Saint Wendacious of Murphy Street in the city of Hoboken . I have the papers as proof . MAN Sir . I am flabbergasted . CHORUS Sir . He has the papers as proof. ** Pause.Time is empty air . Pause.To be or nobody . Pause.All theaters are haunted . The YOUNG MAN disappears . MR . RIOSO All theaters are haunted , Mr. Pretzel , everybody knows that . MAN I swear I know nothing of these things . FIRST WOMAN You know very well , Horace , but you are a coward and a liar , for after you had driven me stark , raving mad I would go and wander far and wide , yes , go and wander far and wide among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " white woman of Bay Ridge , " because of the spectral appearance of my dress , particularly in the moonlight ; so I was a ghost before I had even died . I was the " white woman of Bay Ridge , " which you must remember having read about in the newspapers , Horace . p. 9 MAN That 's the first thing anybody has said that makes sense . Yes , I recall reading about the " white woman of Bay Ridge " in the newspapers , but how was I to know that was you ? And all the time I thought she was in the kitchen baking apple pies . A strange MAN enters . SECOND MAN Why is it when the police find a man dead or unconscious on the street they always diagnose the case as one of intoxicants ? Is it possible for them to conceive that some people do exist who do not indulge in intoxicants ? It is about time that our " wise " police learn that other causes besides overindulgence in intoxicants can produce unconsciousness and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case , as reported both in the Herald and the Tribune , is a case in point , and only the most recent example of this asinine perversity . MAN Who the devil are you , and why do you come stomping in here , making such a row ? SECOND MAN I am J. Henry Fruitnight , and I have written a letter on this matter to the editors of the Times . Say , I have caught a distinct odor of clam pie , clam pie and gingerbread . And no wonder ! What is all that clam pie and gingerbread doing , all heaped up like that on the stage ? Never seen the like of it . He exits , muttering.Stupefying prodigious asinine The FIRST GIRL enters dressed as a Western Union boy . p. 10 BOY ( Girl ) Telegram for Mr. Charles Peck . MAN snatches it and reads it . Meanwhile , the BOY looks around in wonderment.Mr . Oscar Hammerstein 's new Theater Republic , which opened last night , is beyond question one of the most attractive , comfortable and well-conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her.The decoration of the interior , in which greens and reds are combined with much gilding , is exceedingly rich , while the chairs are wide and easy to sit in . The acoustics are good , and the ornamental dome is very handsome The ventilation appliances were at fault last night , but this doubtless will be rectified . It is unfortunate that the entrance hall from the street is low . A tall man surmounted by a tall top hat has nothing for it but to ignominiously duck when he comes to the doorway . Pause.So what 's in the telegram , Pops ? MAN Michael O'Connell was found dead yesterday in his room at 322 West Fifteenth Street , where he had lived two weeks . On his bureau was found an empty medicine bottle , and an open letter , on which was written : " Oh , my poor head ! Will it ever get better ? I have had that awful pain for the past seven or eight weeks , and have lost nearly seventeen pounds since July . A fortuneteller told me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A sad moment . p. 11 BOY ( Girl ) Willie Mcleer , you know , was arrested for stealing a dressed pig from the Penn Yards near the foot of Sixth Street . Raspberry . Goes out . MAN ( Deeply moved . ) Michael O'Connell , you see , was my natural child by Martha O'Connell , who worked in the theater , with Mr. Belasco . CHORUS With Mr. Belasco ? MAN With Mr. Belasco , and that is the root cause of my antagonism to the theater . MR . RIOSO Motivation is the key to unraveling the mystery of the human soul . CHORUS Time is empty air . Pause.To be or nobody . Pause.All theaters are haunted . MR . RIOSO All theaters are haunted , everybody knows that . MAN Nothing . NOTHING . Nothing will come of nothing . He sits glumly.That telegraph boy who was just here , that was no boy , that was my daughter , Mary . Why does she mock me so ? FIRST WOMAN There is an old Albanian proverb : Behind every hero is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Independent Subway Station at Twenty-third Street and Eighth Avenue you will not fail to have noticed a strange door marked " Night Forces Structure . " A tall MAN with a tall top hat enters from the lobby , bends low to avoid the low ceiling , and seats himself in the shadows of the mezzanine . Simultaneously , another WOMAN appears in the balcony , muttering to herself . CHORUS ( Repeating at intervals . ) One single demon knows more than all of you . The SECOND GIRL enters from left wing . SECOND GIRL If you ask me , it 's the devil who 's behind all this rumpus . The devil gets into young people 's heads , and makes ' em do what they want , like smoke cigars , play blackjack , and join the theater . Does n't matter how smart you think you are , the devil 's smarter , and he 's behind a whole lot of modern devilishment . Like that devil Carl Schurz , and his talk of that devil Aguinaldo , and all those Filipinos , devils ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in Leadville , Colorado , yeah , the ones that shouted down Governor Roosevelt the other day . Demoniacal . Devils in the streets , devils in the banks and courts of law , devils in the mills and factories churning out the work of the devil : anarchy , strikes , sedition . People from the old country with strange hats , and beards , garlic , and animal shoes . You can always tell the devils because they all wear animal shoes , furry , with cloven hooves , like animals ; like all those people on the stage there , all those devils , just a-sitting there , thinking smutty thoughts ; doing the work of the devil ; using the Lord 's name in vain , and never doing a thing without listening to what the devil says , because if you look hard you can see little furry devils leaning over all their shoulders , whispering smutty thoughts into their ears , up there , concocting dark delights and crazy works of evil , all of ' em , * with their furry little ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience , into their ears . A ghoulish light appears in the grate below the stage . p. 13 MAN Oh , be quiet , will you , Bertha , for Christ 's sake . Matilda or Martha , whoever you are ! MR . RIOSO This strange door , this strange door bearing the cryptic legend " Night Forces Structure , " marks the entrance to the ghost world . From there , they scratch their way , through unknown tunnels and passages , here , to the basement of this place , exhausted . Why ? The souls of the dead are hungry for stories of the dead , and fires , disasters , catastrophes of every kind . Pause.Motivation is the key to unraveling the mystery of the human mystery . FIRST WOMAN ( Blows out candle . ) As I was saying , behind every traitor is a hero . There are plenty , believe me , even in places like theaters , where forgetfulness is a law , and gratitude an implication of folly . The only thing , after all , that separates us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so much empty air ; air that we take into our lungs when we talk about freedom , as though we meant it , and were not talking about money ; because most people , face it , are stupid , and could n't tell a play from a pineapple . Also , there is the case of those few hapless idealists who believe in fucking , hopeless , idealistic fucking ; but they are even more unfortunate because the flesh does n't wear well once we are dead . People who think too much about fucking after they are dead have problems ; people with problems do n't interest me anymore . I would like to know a few simple things , things that had a bearing on my life , my life before I came to America from Poland , a country that does not exist most of the time , and that , when it does , is regarded as something of a joke , even by the sophisticated . Pause.I 'm just a disillusioned ghost who wants to understand what the meaning of all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of being a theater spook one gets to be tired of perplexities , and changes of management ; and the theater syndicate , and Mr. Belasco ( who time has not treated well ) , and Minsky 's Burlesque , and Harry Houdini lowering elephants into artificial lakes under the stage ( there 's still an artificial lake under the stage , I 'm not kidding , there is ! ) , and The Girl of the Golden West , and Abie 's Irish Rose , and forty years of porno flicks and chop-and-slice karate films . Mr. What's-his-name , to whom I was with whom , shall we say , I incurred matrimony , has two daughters , you see : one is always threatening to kill herself if we return to Germany ; while the other continually threatens to run away , back to there , with her brother , so she can implement her Socialist dreams ( she is under the interesting delusion that Germany offers a more fertile soil for social progress than the United States , and this in nineteen hundred ! ) ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish , and not German , and just between us I would n't go back if you paid me , and I 'm thoroughly dead and know what I 'm talking about . Although , the part of Poland we are from is called Germany now , so she has a point . Pause . Quietly.Also , there is the question of time ; also , there is the question of what time is , and how it manages to do what it does , and how it erases all things , especially those that are important and mean so much to us we could never articulate them if we tried ; also , how it leaves us only with reminders of what we would rather forget , at best ; or what we did that we are ashamed of , and managed to hide , just barely , even if for only a little while , while those we hated and despised , and who hated and despised us , were laughing behind our backs ; even when we were children and first got involved in theater : the abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why everything that time touches is so ephemeral , and involved with death ; also , why talking about it , like this , or like someone who knows what they 're talking about , makes us look so stupid . Like now , with me , a dead person , talking . Can you imagine ? p. 14 MAN Whatever are you driving at ? FIRST WOMAN Have n't you guessed by now ? MAN I believe you have connived with my children against me . MAN IN TOP HAT ( Standing . ) You fool ! Your name is not Horace Pretzel . MAN IN TOP HAT Your name is Charles A. Peck , and you were sandbagged to death last night at the corner of Seventeenth Street and Ninth Avenue , having been seen , in the company of certain rowdy women , at certain saloons , saloons frequented by lowlife types and the habitually bibulous . I am Archie Kinsolving , alias Philip Sutton , your murderer . He strides out , as FIRST GIRL and SECOND GIRL enter and approach . MAN Then what , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GIRLS Because you hate and despise theaters . Pause . MAN ( Wonderingly . ) Why , then . I suppose I must really be dead . He lies down . They cover him . Pause . MR . RIOSO Ladies and gentlemen , as the intermission has turned out to be a little longer than we had expected , we shall help the time to pass with a choral recitation of yesterday 's fires . CHORUS recites a litany of yesterday 's fires . Musical interlude : a fake funeral . p. 15 CHORUS 1:15 A.M. : 432 Eighth Avenue ; John Lewis ; damage $5.1:45 A.M. : 99 Sheriff Street ; August Jopowitz ; damage , $150. 3:55 A.M. : 28 Fifth Avenue ; Amos R.

FIRST GIRL The baby they found all chopped up was my sister 's , not mine . I work in a shirt factory . Is that the real color of your hair ? SECOND GIRL No , it 's pretty mousy . The actual color , I mean . FIRST GIRL ( Pointing to the WOMAN . ) That lady ? The one standing in the box , she 's the mistress of David Belasco , and she lives in a secret apartment located somewhere above the dome up there . Points with a flashlight . SECOND GIRL Do you believe in God ? FIRST GIRL No , not much . My family 's Irish Catholic , so I got force-fed religion . Kind 've ruined it for me . But I like the spectacle . The sense of theater . Pause.But I only go to church on Christmas Eve . p. 16 SECOND GIRL My real sister became a nun to meet men . I mean , I do have a real sister in real life . Or I did when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in a theater when I grew up . Lo and behold , it all came to pass : when I grew up and died I ended up here , and now I live in a theater . FIRST GIRL So it did . Pause.You sure that 's not a wig , I mean , it 's very convincing for fake hair , but it looks a little too real . The highlights and stuff . SECOND GIRL I 'm not the wig type . FIRST GIRL I was n't saying you were the wig type . Their identities begin to wander . SECOND GIRL I was just saying it looked fake , you know ? It 's hardly the same thing . You do n't have to get in a snit about it . FIRST GIRL What about the baby you murdered ? SECOND GIRL No , it only looked like a dead baby . Actually it was a dressed pig I stole from Willie Mcleer , who stole it himself , from a meat locker somewhere down on Horatio Street . Cutest little dressed pig , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowtie . Adorable . Pause . FIRST GIRL I do n't believe anything I read in the newspapers . I am a confirmed skeptic . p. 17 SECOND GIRL I 've been studying aboriginal cultures , from the outback , western Australia . I read an article that said their shamans sing one song all their lives , and when they die they become the song they 've sung all their lives , and fly off , all around the hard , flinty places of the desert , as pure song , and people hear them and think they 're echoes . Pause.Then they go mad , the people who hear them , I mean . FIRST GIRL Yet , there is abundant evidence from their songs and cherished traditions that Australian aborigines are by no means destitute of some qualities in which civilized men glory , such as the power of inventing tragic and sarcastic fictions , the thirst for religious mystery , contempt for pain , and reverence for departed friends and ancestors . Pause . SECOND GIRL I 'd rather be what we are than an echo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beats me . FIRST GIRL Does n't it feel cold in here ? SECOND GIRL Yeah , so what ? It 's winter . FIRST GIRL I forget , is winter when it 's cold , or is that summer ? SECOND GIRL Winter is when it gets cold . p. 18 FIRST GIRL Are you sure ? SECOND GIRL You can take it from me . FIRST GIRL Who do you suppose that old rhinoceros is ? SECOND GIRL Some bigwig . Look at those shoes . FIRST GIRL Did you have any hobbies , when you were growing up ? As a kid , I mean . SECOND GIRL I grew up in a Socialist family . We were n't supposed to have hobbies . FIRST GIRL What 's a Socialist again ? SECOND GIRL Share the wealth . Common ownership of the means of production . Equality . FIRST GIRL Is Governor Roosevelt a Socialist ? SECOND GIRL I do n't think so . He 's an American . Pause . FIRST GIRL What 's wealth again ? SECOND GIRL Wealth is stuff . FIRST GIRL Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff that is , that 's wealth . All the stuff that 's heavier than mere mortality . All the stuff that sinks to the bottom . FIRST GIRL Right , right . Now I remember . Weight . Solid weight . Massive . Ponderous . Heavy . Pause.All the stuff , or just some of it ? p. 19 SECOND GIRL Most of it , except for the cheesy stuff . The stuff that 's not worth anything , the stuff nobody wants , the stuff nobody has any use for . Like old theaters and stuff . FIRST GIRL Now I got it . SECOND GIRL It 's awful creepy in here . FIRST GIRL You 're talking that way again . Stop it . SECOND GIRL Okay . Pause.What exactly is a theater again ? FIRST GIRL Kinda big place . Red walls . Like the inside of the human heart . Only bigger , and not as empty . SECOND GIRL Okay . But not as empty . I got it . Pause.Do n't be angry , but who are you exactly ? FIRST GIRL Suicide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said I 'd meet the wrong kind of people . Became a bad girl . A pro . Did n't last long at that . Took some medicine . Enough medicine to kill five grown men , they said . Bother the taste of it ! Found my body on a hook in the East River . SECOND GIRL Sad . I got in the family way . Boyfriend 's a yegg . Was , that is . That 's a safe-cracker . After I was dead he slit his throat , but did n't die . Later they hanged him , twice . For the murder of Charles A. Peck . The first time he did n't die . Archie Kinsolving was his name . Loved the theater . Worked here backstage , his day job , that is. p. 20 FIRST GIRL What 's your name ? SECOND GIRL Forget . Something like Flora Floris . FIRST GIRL Rita 's mine . Rita Mingus . Pause . The CHORUS has assembled and begins a slow , slow softshoe . CHORUS Welcome to the theater The GIRLS dart out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Peck.Perhaps you wonder why things are arranged as they are . The people , dead . Everything , cold and dead . The theater , a wreck . All of this is for you , * because of you , against you , all of this is time 's work . Time is empty air . Pause.To be or nobody . Pause.All theaters are haunted , everybody knows that . They sit . MR . RIOSO But the truth is , the dead will find no peace here because this theater , their abode , their tenement and abode , is to be reopened , as of this night , and their souls are to be evicted , driven out into the blackened wind of America , an America they will not recognize , an America that has changed beyond description . THIRD WOMAN I do n't know about that , but I do know this is the longest intermission I have ever heard of . I returned from the powder room and , as you see , have taken my seat . I would not miss the opening night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am a great admirer of Mr. Hearn , and of Mr. Hammerstein also . Also I intend to go backstage and ask Mr. Lionel Barrymore for his autograph , as he is a fine young actor . But I do not understand how it can take so long for them to prepare for the second act . The first act was perfectly acceptable , but I have many questions about the piece , and what it means and how it is supposed to be understood . I would like to know which of the two young men the charming young girl is truly in love with ; although I do hope it is the older , since they are to be married ; also , I hope there can be a general reconciliation among them ; also , I am intrigued by the idea of a courtship between an elderly , meddlesome , prodigiously warm-hearted and slow-speaking scallop fisherman and the spinster who fears to get married because she has read the book of Genesis and found all the " begats " alarming ; also , I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music-hall humor , much as the speech about the man who went swimming and returned in a barrel , as sophisticated theater-goers , I 'm sure we would all we would appreciate this ; also some moderation of the too intimate talk about married life , as this too might be an affront to the sensitive also Pause . p. 21 MR . RIOSO Are there any other hopes you have for the second act ? THIRD WOMAN Well , no . Although , now that you ask , I would also hope that there be no mention of the First and Second World Wars , the Great Depression of the thirties , the annihilation of the European Jews , also , the atomic bombing of Japan , the various Third World client wars of the forties , fifties , sixties , seventies , eighties , and so forth , as all of these unpleasant events might not be germane , strictly speaking , to the hopes and fears of the simple fisher-folk of Sag Harbor , and their humble lives ; also , that temptation would clearly be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been nearly ninety years since the conclusion of the first act and therefore we are rapidly nearing the millennium that the Pentecostals have been desiring , also those who prefer the nullity of the future over the insanity of the past ; also those who can not help but prate over the end of this , that or the other , the end of ideology , of history , of nature ( when we know perfectly well these things are n't going anywhere ! ) ; and also , the prayers of those with a liking for round numbers . But two thousand does have a bit of a hollow ring to it , does n't it ? MR . RIOSO ( Patience wearing thin . ) Anything else , you 'd like , from the second act ? p. 22 THIRD WOMAN Yes , I should also like them to bring on a real clam pie and real gingerbread , when they do . Because it is quite obvious these things are called for , given the kinds of common fisherfolk represented , and the kind of pictorial realism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belasco , I am told . Therefore these things ought to be real , and not false , when they appear , this clam pie and gingerbread , * I mean . We in the audience ought to be able to test the veracity of this gingerbread and clam pie , by our noses . MR . RIOSO and ( In a clam pie apotheosis . ) THE CHORUS Yes , Mrs. Clara C. Lester , the clam pie shall be brought in smoking hot from the kitchen . The pie shall have been baked in a huge dish , and Cap'n Dan'l shall dish it out to everybody , who shall thereupon eat . They shall all eat excepting Freeman Whitemarsh , who has not been crossed in love , and therefore shall not eat . The pie shall be the real thing , and so shall be the gingerbread that follows . You shall be able to smell the cooked clams , and if you are hungry , and like to smell cooking in the theater , you shall be delighted .

As I was apprehended by Sergeant Bugler , I lost my temper and exclaimed : " I am Frank Worth , of East Twenty-first Street , I am worth over one million dollars , and I will not stand for this outrage . " Sergeant Bugler persisted in his deluded sense of duty , and before I was able to remonstrate further I burst a vessel , here , in my head and succumbed on the spot . Informed of my demise , my terrier , Spot , lost her wits and attacked , in a cage , a golden eagle belonging to our neighbor , the naturalist Jankow , from Lubeck .

FIRST GIRL and SECOND GIRL appear in the upper box . p. 23 FIRST GIRL Did it occur to you , Frank Worth , that I , Emma Cottrell , took poison and died from it , and no one knew more about the matter than that I had died , and my name and nothing more , and no one cared ? SECOND GIRL Did it matter to you that my eye was cut in two by a piece of glass in a loud and terrifying factory , and that I died of an overdose of carbolic acid some time later , me , Esther* Loesche , a girl of no importance ?

CHORUS But in reality p. 26 MASTER our Mr. Rioso was one George Washington of West Twenty-eighth Street , number unknown . Washington was employed in the renovation of the Theater Republic , shortly to be reopened as the Belasco Theater ; he was accidentally killed by a crowbar that fell from the roof garden in the process of construction above : the roof garden was designed as a Dutch farm . A windmill was built on top of the theater 's stage house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stork 's nest on one chimney and an attached stable with two cows . Beside the stage house on the auditorium roof was a duck pond , over which was built a rustic bridge . The wall fronting the street was built up above the roof line and decorated to look like a ruined castle . Beside that was an imitation grist mill with a working water mill . Washington was laying tile on the floor far below while workmen were installing a wooden beam above , near the ruined castle . One of these men was using a crowbar . His foot slipped , and to save himself from falling he dropped the crowbar and caught hold of a fake weathervane . The crowbar fell to the floor . It struck Washington on the head , fracturing the skull . The body was removed to the morgue . The workman who dropped the crowbar was William Gorman of number seventy East Twelfth Street . BELASCO appears high in the balcony . GHOST OF DAVID BELASCO Wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , all of it totally wrong ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced my hand . By their monopolistic machinations they had threatened to shut me out of New York theater altogether . This caused me grave uneasiness . On the evening of January 7 , 1902 , I was in my little room in Carnegie Hall , seeking to devise some means of obtaining control of a New York theater . There was a knock at the door A portentous pause . A MAN enters.My visitor proved to be none other than the theatrical manager Oscar Hammerstein. p. 27 GHOST OF OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN Mr. Belasco , the theatrical syndicate is trying to crush me out of business . Valuable attractions must have been prevented from patronizing my houses this season . I must have attractions . You must have a New York theater or find yourself helpless . I have one in Forty-second Street , the Republic , which I am willing to turn over to you . I have come here on an impulse , on the chance that you may be willing to take over control of the Theater Republic . GHOST OF DAVID BELASCO Mr. Hammerstein , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHORUS Five-year lease with an option for renewal . Thirty thousand dollars a year and ten percent of all gross receipts . BELASCO AND HAMMERSTEIN Agreed . They shake hands . Hammerstein exits . GHOST OF DAVID BELASCO I shall have to alter it . The stage is wrong . The house is wrong , the colors set my teeth on edge . Pause.Tore out the whole interior , leaving nothing but the roof , and four walls . A worried MAN enters . CHORUS A stranger presented himself to Belasco , demanding that he be permitted to inspect the property , and explaining that he held the mortgage on it . p. 28 GHOST OF DAVID BELASCO I have nothing to do with the mortgage , that is Mr. Hammerstein 's business . MAN God above me ! I 've got a mortgage on four walls and a hole in the ground ! He exits , tearing his hair . GHOST OF DAVID BELASCO The theater is , first of all , a place for acting , a place for the acting of plays ; though to a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a place for almost anything rather than acting  --  first of all , a place for the exploitation of their conceit and the making of money by any means . Pause.Cost me a hundred fifty thousand to rebuild the place . Finest theatrical appointments . The stage floor was , in fact , an elevator , a movable platform fifteen by thirty , by means of which scenery and properties could be transferred rapidly to and from the cellar . The ropes for " flying " were counter-weighted , and working with a crank one man could raise pieces , which , in former times would have required six . Border and footlights were compartmentalized to prevent " spill , " and all lamps in the theater were connected , " on resistance , " so that all the lights in the house could be raised or lowered as required , gently , by degrees.The drop curtains were of Rose du Barry velvet . On the back of every chair , upholstered in silvergreen tapestry , was embroidered a Napoleonic bee , which promptly became " bee for Belasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the like . Torches , garlands , wreaths , and festoonery framed the rich tapestries on the side and rear walls of the auditorium.I have many plans for this theater , ladies and gentlemen . In all ways I desire to make this new dramatic home of ours a dwelling of refinement , good taste , good entertainment , and good art . No stone shall be left unturned , no effort unmade to accomplish that end . You can not know what it means to me to speak to you , after thirty years of labor in the dramatic calling , from the stage of my own theater . Ladies and gentlemen , I thank you , I thank you I can say no more . Pause.Oh , the impertinence of imperishable dust , oh , the infamy of consuming time ! He sits on the lip of the stage.When I was a kid , I loved to get away by myself . My dream was to have a studio . I remember how I spent my first three bits : I bought a packing box and a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cellar , where it would n't get too wet , and I climbed inside of it and dreamed for a long time of the wonderful colors I should one day be able to buy and hang about my walls . From that I kept increasing and adding , selling and buying more and more , rarer and rarer things , until now He gestures . p. 29 CHORUS One demon knows more than any of you . Repeats , etc . Pause.Motivation is the key to unraveling the secret of human destiny . Pause.All theaters are haunted . Pause.To be or nobody . Pause.Time is empty air . A long pause . Two beautiful WOMEN dressed in white gowns pass slowly through . GHOST OF DAVID BELASCO America has too many lunch counters . WOMAN IN WHITE ( Pausing . ) Too many lunch counters ? GHOST OF DAVID BELASCO Exactly . A man who might otherwise be a thinking man rushes into lunch , grabs a sandwich , a glass of milk , a piece of pie , and presto  --  he has killed a Hamlet . OTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Germany ? Pause . GHOST OF DAVID BELASCO ( Regarding the WOMEN . ) They can speak little English . They take care of my studio for me , and on a Sunday you will always see them , kneeling before the image of Christ , flanked on either side by the beautiful thieves . WOMEN exit , and BELASCO follows.And again we shall climb from the caterpillar into the butterfly , and from that into something higher , and up and on , until the fall set in . Blackout . End of play .
