 | Patricia Gilmore arrived at her Boston home for lunch at 1:30 p.m. on December 20 , 1979 . Smartly dressed in a style that suited her job as the head teller at a bank in nearby Norwood , Mass. , Patty was all aglow . At the bank 's Christmas party the day before , an official had whispered that she was up for another promotion . " Does that make you happy ? " he had asked . " Oh , yes ! " she told him . " For the first time in years years I 'm really happy . " She was also happy about the trip to Florida she was planning with her girl friends . It was cold and gray that December day , but the Gilmore home in Canton , on Boston 's South Side , was bright with the festive touches of Christmas . The tree was up and the mantel was hung with stockings for the eight Gilmore children who still lived at home . Sitting in the den , Patty heard the family dog yelp , and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding a gun . " Do n't move , " he said to Patricia , " or I 'll shoot . " Speechless with terror , she shrank back in her chair . Her worst nightmare , she realized , had come true . Three years earlier , when she had just turned 21 and was working only part-time in the bank , Patricia had taken a weekend job at a local hardware store . The manager , Bradford Prendergast , was 26 , a six-foot-one-inch , 225-pound dynamo of energy and efficiency . He ran the store with a crisp , no-nonsense manner . Patty did not care for him at first . She found him " too macho " and self-centered and was put off by the pictures she had noticed in his office of scantily clad , muscular male body builders . Prendergast 's own photograph was prominent among them because the year before he had won the title of Mr. New Hampshire . Within a few months , however , Patty and Brad were dating . She learned that he had grown up in a suburb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had married his schoolgirl sweetheart . There had been two children , then a stormy separation and divorce . He had moved to New Hampshire to work in a chain of hardware stores . A hard worker , within three years Brad was promoted to regional manager and troubleshooter for stores in the chain . In the fall of 1976 Patty and Brad took an apartment together in a nearby town . The arrangement was not known to Patty 's parents , who would have been upset by it . Catholic and conventional to the core , both Joe and Mary Gilmore belonged to a generation in which love , early marriage , and a large family were inseparable . Mary Gilmore had borne 12 children and had remained at home to raise them , while Joe spent days and nights behind the wheel of a longhaul truck in order to provide for his family . Patricia had inherited her father 's quick wit and out spoken n l w e and she loved to banter and argue with him . There was also boundless af-fection and love between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head defiantly and storm out of the house . Patty , set on her own course , was eager to become fully independent and Wylie take charge of her own life . Before long Patty had a full-time job at the Norwood bank . She and Brad both worked hard during the week and played hard on weekends and holidays . Wherever they went , heads turned , for they were a striking couple . On Patty 's twenty-second birthday they became engaged , and Brad gave her a diamond ring . But beneath the dazzle there were dark moments . Brad brooded over his rejection by his first wife . He was fiercely possessive of Patty , but whenever they fought , he vanished and she knew that he was seeing other women . At home as well as at work he was a perfectionist . If Patty displeased him , he exploded with rage . By the summer of 1978 the romance began to fade , and when she learned that Prendergast had harassed his former wife during the time they were separated , and that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her relationship with Brad must end . Taking her close friend Sheila with her , Patty went to the apartment she shared @#  | with Brad to get her clothes ? but they were not there . The next evening she telephoned Sheila . " Brad 's meeting me in the parking lot of the bank with my clothes , " she said . " Could you come over ? " When Sheila arrived with her boyfriend , Prendergast was sitting in his car . Patricia came out of the bank , and Sheila , thinking that there would be no trouble , got back into her car . Suddenly her boyfriend shouted , " Brad , do n't do it ! " Prendergast had leaped from his car , brandishing a knife . Seeing it . Patty ran back toward the bank . He raced after her , but she managed to get through the door and lock it behind her . Brad screamed obscenities , slashed at his wrists with the knife , and banged on the bank 's glass door with his blood-spattered hands . Then he rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw them on the ground . He jumped back into his car and drove it back and forth over the clothing and across the grass where Patty had been standing . Inside the bank Patty was sobbing , " Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! " Prendergast was charged with disorderly conduct . And while his case was pending he launched a campaign to get Patty back . He sent her boxes of longstemmed roses , wrote letters entreating her to return to him , and even enclosed checks so she could buy some new clothes . For Patricia , the romance was all over . She tore up the checks , threw away the roses . But Brad would not accept her rejection . Soon he began telephoning her at work and lingering outside the bank at closing time . Fellow workers began escorting her to her car . One evening , early in January 1979 , just after Patty had gotten into her car , Prendergast suddenly appeared out of the shadows and said , " I must talk to you , Patty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the car and ran toward the bank . " Patty ! " he shouted after her . " I love you ! " Then with a loud groan , he fell to the ground . He had thrust a knife into his abdomen . Prendergast was treated for his wounds at a Boston hospital and interviewed by psychiatrists . Brad told the doctors that he was sorry for his actions and promised that he would make no further attempt to hurt himself or anyone else . The psychiatrists decided that he was " in touch with reality and showed no signs of psychosis . " Patricia , however , was now convinced that Prendergast was a deadly menace . She asked the Norwood police for protection but was told there was nothing the police could do without violating Prendergast 's civil rights . Patty had concealed most of Prendergast 's harassment from her family . When a question was raised , she said simply , " I 'm through with him . He 's out of my life . " Finally , she decided to confide in her mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 'll get too upset ? but maybe you can help me . " One Friday in mid-January 1979 , Mrs. Gilmore and Patty went to the Dedham District Court to swear out a warrant against Prendergast . " They brushed us off , " Mrs. Gilmore recalls . " Patty was told she should take her problem to the Stoughton court . ' On Monday Patty went to Stoughton and came home fuming . " They wo n't do anything either , " she told her mother . " They say that since he did n't actually touch me with that knife , I do n't have enough grounds for a complaint . " Acting on her own , Mrs. Gilmore called the chief of police in Norwood , but he was out of town . " We are responsible people , " she says . " My daughter was working at the local hank . Why could n't they take an interest ? "  | A spirited girl , Patty let the Norwood police know that she was n't satisfied with their response . It seemed to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuisance . In February the Canton police department lodged a complaint against Prendergast for making annoying phone calls . The case was dismissed when he entered McLean Hospital for treatment . There , psychiatrists reached a conclusion very different from the opinion of psychiatrists at the previous hospital . " While the patient appears superficially not to have a thought disorder , " one McLean psychiatrist reported , " underneath there is quite a large disorder . He is a very dangerous man . " Later that month a psychiatrist at Glenside Hospital noted , " He has been having thoughts about getting revenge against his girl friend . He had planned to kidnap her but does not know what he would do after that . He does feel that if he is going to die , he is going to take her with him . He says , She has made it since we broke up , and I 've got absolutely nothing . ' " Out of the hospital , Brad resumed stalking Patty with his car . OccasionalIs he would draw close enough to nudge her rear bumper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | She was frightened to death , " recalls e bank manager . " She could n't eat . She could n't sleep . In her car she was constantly looking in the mirror to see if he as following her . " By this time Patty 's plight could no longer be hidden from her father . Joe more was enraged . But when he deared he was rounding up some trucker ends to give Prendergast a beating he 'd . ver forget , Patricia begged her father stay out of it . The man is a mental case , " she said . 3e 's dangerous , Dad . Let the courts -d the police handle it . " At her family 's insistence she did : - ee to move back home from her : . artment , and from then on , her mother - equently drove her to and from her ' at the bank . In May 1979 Patricia finally got a rt order restraining Prendergast from y further harassment . He disappeared ; t this , it would be learned much later , as because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Taunton State Hospital psychiatrists - und that he was a " smoldering time mb ? he may be extremely dangerous himself and others . " In June he was sent to New England eaconess Hospital in Boston and treat ' with electroshock therapy . About a . ek later a girl friend telephoned Patty the bank . " Brad 's sitting on a motor ; le across the street from you , " she d . The police were summoned . But the nute a detective approached , Prendert roared off , managing to elude a rsuing police car . Later , an official of the bank criticized e detective for letting Prendergast espe . But the detective responded angri " The girl is your problem . Get rid of er and you wo n't have a problem . " Patricia overheard him . Later she told r mother , " That 's the way those police think . They do n't care , and they do n't want to be bothered . " Later that evening the phone rang in the Gilmore home , and a man who identified himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she took the phone , Prendergast said , " I almost killed you today but something stopped me . " Now the Gilmore family insisted that a warrant be issued for Prendergast 's arrest . He was charged with threats of murder , and on July 12 the Stoughton District Court committed him to Bridgewater State Hospital for observation . A hospital psychologist found Prendergast " schizophrenic , mentally ill , and capable of serious if not murderous harm . Failure to hospitalize him would cause serious harm because of the potential of extreme danger to the patient and to the former girl friend , whom the patient planned to kill . " But a Bridgewater psychiatrist re- ported that he could not determine Prendergast 's state of mind because he would not cooperate . In September Brad was sent not to a mental hospital but to Billerica Prison , where he was to serve six months for his threats . He was scheduled to be released in March 1980 . For the first time in more than a year , the Gilmore family experienced some relief . Patty began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large Gilmore family was a joyful time . It would not have been so happy if the Gilmores had known that Bradford Prendergast also was celebrating the holiday ? out of prison ! At Billerica , Brad had been a model prisoner , quiet and cooperative . A prison counselor arranged for Brad to live in a dormitory outside the prison walls , and she also helped him obtain jail credit for the summer spent at Bridge- water Hospital , thereby reducing his sentence by nearly two months . No one at the prison notified the Gilmore family of this drastic change . Nor were they notified when Prendergast was granted a second 48-hour furlough early in December . " We had no reason to notify the Canton police or the Gilmore family , " prison authorities later explained , " because the papers committing him to prison did not identify the target of his threats . " On December 19 Prendergast was granted a third 48-hour furlough . By noon the next day he had bought a hunting knife and a gun and was in a car outside the Norwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took no notice of the car trailing behind her . In the Gilmore home Patty 's mother heard voices . She came into the den and saw Brad standing over her daughter . Patty 's sister Joan had run into the room and was standing protectively in front of her mother . Brad snapped , " Get back in your room , or I 'll blow your head off . " " What is this all about ? " Mrs. Gilmore demanded . " What are you doing here ? What do you want ? " " Money , " he said . " I 've busted out of Billerica , and I need it for a plane ticket . " " 1 ' 11 get you the money , " Patty said . She started to get out of her chair , but he seized her in a tight grip . " Do n't bother , " he said . " You 're coming with me . " " Brad , " Joan cried frantically , " I 've got $400 downstairs . Let me get it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been planning this for a year , and nobody is going to stop me . " He thrust Patty toward the door . Nearly fainting , she fell into the Christmas tree . Her mother moved toward her , but Prendergast pointed his gun at Patty . " Get away from Patty , " he said , " or I 'll kill her right here . " " Tell us how much money you want , " @# @#  | ' s mother pleaded . " We 'll get it ve thousand dollars , " he answered tly . He had his arm locked tightly Id Patty and was pushing her out oor . " I 'll call in an hour and tell where to bring it . Do n't call the or I 'll kill her . " ? n he was gone . Gilmores telephoned the police . tes later a Canton policeman pulled side Brad 's blue car , but he raced highway exit and vanished . State ocal police , assisted by helicopters , d out in pursuit . But Brad con1 to elude them . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . o hours later a man who had ? egistered at a Massachusetts mombled into the corridor from his with blood streaming from his . d throat and wrists . He was BradPrendergast. the ambulance he cried , " I did n't to do it ! I wanted her love back ! made me do it ! Her face ! I can see her face ! " Three hours later Patty 's body was found by the side of a road about 25 miles from the motel . She had been bound and then stabbed 26 times with great ferocity . At his trial Prendergast pleaded innocent by reason of insanity . With his consent his psychiatric records became public for the first time . Despite his history of mental disorders , the jury found Prendergast criminally responsible for his act . A judge sentenced him to life imprisonment . Today the Gilmores are . an anguished , grief-stricken family . Mrs. Gilmore says , " The state considers the case closed , but it never will be for us . I am not the same woman . My husband is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be the same . We will never get over the horrible thing that happened to our daughter . What makes it so terrible is that we did n't have to lose Patty . " The Gilmores know that Bradford Prendergast wielded the knife that killed Patty , but they blame the court and hospital systems as much as they blame him for their daughter 's murder . Joe Gilmore has filed a lawsuit against state hospital and prison officials , charging them with reckless disregard of the lifethreatening danger to Patty . The agony of his loss shows on Joe 's eyes as he says , " We want the blunders of those in the system to be brought out in a public trial . Our daughter would be alive today if the police , the courts , and the psychiatrists had done their jobs . Many people knew that Prendergast was mentally deranged and determined to kill Patty . Why was he permitted to harass her for months ? Why was he sent to a prison instead of to a mental hospital ? Why was n't the prison properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those furloughs ? And why were n't the local police and Patty informed the moment he set foot outside prison ? " We are not seeking revenge . Nothing is going to bring Patty back . But if the people who really are responsible for her death are brought to account , perhaps some other girl or some other family may be spared a tragedy like ours . " Adds Mary Gilmore , " Why did n't at least one of those professional people say to himself : This could be my daughter in danger ' ? Why did n't they want to protect her ? "
