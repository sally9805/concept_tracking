A star by any other name is not so sweet to astronomers <P> Television 's Johnny Carson has one . So does Actor Richard Burton . Pop Singers Barry Manilow and Engelbert Humperdinck have two apiece . The Queen Mother got one as an 80th-birthday gift . Charles and Diana , the Prince and Princess of Wales , received a pair when they were married . What do these luminaries have in common ? Along with thousands of lesser mortals , each has had his or her name appended to at least one star-of the heavenly kind-in what seems to be the most far-out fad since astrology . <P> A personal star , twinkling in the night , there to gaze at and wish upon , guiding one 's fortunes : it hardly seems possible .

Says Phylis Mosele , 50 , an affable mother of twelve who runs the registry 's U.S. branch in Northfield , Ill. , with her husband <P> John , 51 : " It 's a perfectly valid system . " <P> Astronomers think otherwise . Some refer to the mail-order operation as " Stargate " and " Starscam . " Says Swarthmore College Astronomer Wulff Heintz , without even the trace of a twinkle : " You could call it a fraud . " What irritates professional stargazers is that the self-styled registry , which began in 1979 and " sold " more than 30,000 stars last year , is invading turf that has long been their special preserve . By astronomical tradition , only a few dozen of the brightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldebaran , are called by proper names , many of which derive from early Arab astronomy . The remainder are listed in various catalogues , drily and unromantically , by initials and numbers that tell astronomers such no-nonsense things as their position , type and magnitude ( brightness ) .
