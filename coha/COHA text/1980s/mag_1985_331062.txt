The best thing Harry Banks did in Kenya was put himself out of a job . A community organizer with a degree in marketing , Banks , 42 , joined the Peace Corps in 1982 and left Gary for Nairobi . Last year he was called on to help organize the Kenya Women Finance Trust , the brainchild of a group of local businesswomen who had $50,000 in funds from the Ford Foundation for their project . Banks supervised the hiring of a staff , raised extra funds and set up a six-week bookkeeping course for his loan applicants as well as a procedure for granting loans to small businesses run by women . So far , the trust has lent money  --  in sums ranging from $130 to $1,300  --  to a beauty parlor , a restaurant , a garage , a vegetable stand , two tailoring shops and two kiosks . The loans are being repaid on schedule , and the trust is now run by the local staff . <P> Black and handicapped ( he was born with severe scoliosis , or curvature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Banks defies the stereotype of the naive volunteer who lives in a mud hut and teaches villagers how to dig wells . With his can-do professionalism , he represents a new breed of goal-oriented , well-trained volunteers who are changing the agency . Like their predecessors , however , they are idealists who love a challenge . Says Banks : " In Kenya , every innovative idea , every fantasy and wildest dream I ever had , I 've had the opportunity to do , with no supervisor to say , ' No , that 's too big a risk . ' The Peace Corps gambled on me , and it paid off . " <P> When President Kennedy introduced the Peace Corps in 1961 , it was a bold idea that symbolized the New Frontier spirit . Organized " to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower , " the agency was also expected to counter Soviet and Chinese volunteer movements in the Third World . Said Kennedy : " I am convinced that our young men and women , dedicated to freedom , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionaries who are dedicated to undermining that freedom . " <P> As the years wore on , the program became undisciplined and unfocused . Many volunteers abroad were angered by U.S. involvement in Viet Nam ; some of them had joined the corps to avoid being drafted . They shunned American embassies and agencies and rejected U.S. policy in the countries where they were stationed . Several Latin American nations criticized the volunteers for their political activism against the ruling regimes . Some host countries accused the Peace Corps of being an adjunct to the CIA , a charge that was never proved . In 1971 President Nixon folded the corps into ACTION , an umbrella agency for several federal volunteer organizations . Enrollment sank along with congressional funding as the Peace Corps limped through the ' 70s.
