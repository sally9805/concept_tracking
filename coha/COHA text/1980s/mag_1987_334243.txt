On a wild strip of sea called Gage Roads , 22 sailors perform exhausting , dangerous and precisely choreographed routines . Pitching through the lumpy seas , skippers lean into the wind trying to see if the opponent is tacking . Sewer men , who work below-decks , clamber about readying sails ; tacticians rinse salt from their eyes to scan computer screens . Muscle-bound grinders , crewmen who trim sails with highly geared winches called coffee grinders , grunt and puff against tons of load . <P> For decades the America 's Cup was a millionaire 's mannered contest played on wood decks in the light winds off Newport , R.I. But when a wicked winged keel helped sweep Australia II to victory in 1983 , the upset permanently transformed the long-running naval battle for the knee-high trophy affectionately known as the " Auld Mug . " In the wind-whipped seas of the Indian Ocean , the races between Stars &; Stripes and Kookaburra III are the culmination of a three-year high-tech battle that has involved corporate fund raising , sailing strategy worthy of a war room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the physical and psychological preparedness of elite commandos . <P> While the limelight naturally focuses on the saltwater sovereigns Dennis Conner and Iain Murray , the crews have labored in shadow . But their contributions to winning are critical in Fremantle because the strong winds and heavy seas mean a faster clip than at Newport . " The boat will hit a wave , travel two boat lengths and then hit another , " says Mainsheet Trimmer Jon Wright . " So you constantly have to adjust the sails for the waves . " Observes Skipper Tom Blackaller , whose USA was eliminated in the challengers ' semifinals : " If the crew makes an error , it can be absolutely disastrous .

Having enlisted simply for love of the sport and for whatever honor may come their way , the $75-a-week American crewmen endure a brutal , monastic regime . Most have been working uninterrupted for nearly two years , and the crew had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final months at Fremantle , their training day began at 5:45 a.m. with an hour of heavy weights for grinders , aerobic exercises for the others . After a breakfast that would horrify a cardiologist  --  heaps of bacon , eggs and pancakes  --  they were at the dock just after 8 . At sea by 10:30 , they endlessly honed tacking and sail-changing drills that they already knew by heart . After a drink and dinner , most forgo Fremantle 's night spots . " With the sort of day we put in , " says Wright , 38 and on his fifth Cup campaign , " you do n't feel much like anything else . " Even after sundown the team effort does not stop . For every hour of sailing there are 2 1/2 man-hours of maintenance , much of it done overnight by sailmakers.
