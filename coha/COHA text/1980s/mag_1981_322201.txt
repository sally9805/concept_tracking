Still something of a statesman outside his own country <P> To the dismay of some and the delight of a few , Richard Nixon was back in the headlines . Ronald Reagan had asked him to join ex-Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in the official U.S. delegation to the funeral of Egypt 's Anwar Sadat . Then , mysteriously , Nixon had embarked on a private week 's tour of Middle Eastern and North African capitals , fueling rumors that he was acting as an unofficial emissary for Reagan . ( Not so , say both Nixon and the White House . ) Just back from that trip , Nixon talked with TIME 's Washington Contributing Editor Hugh Sidey : " This is a Reagan opportunity . The Middle East is crying out for strong leadership . It is not enough for the United States to be a broker . " <P> The world 's unique and ubiquitous elder statesman without portfolio was talking , back in his Manhattan office , still tinged with jet lag from his visits to Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Tunisia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the friend of Israel 's enemies than for the Russians to be .

" Nor am I going to take two hours talking to the President . That used to bore the dickens out of me . " <P> There is no written record of the more than ten hours of serious discussion Nixon had with half a dozen Arab leaders . " It was an old friend talking , " he explains . " Sometimes those leaders do n't talk candidly with an ambassador . I did what I always do : at night I made careful notes .

" The moderate Arabs to whom Nixon talked liked Egypt 's new President , Hosni Mubarak , better than Sadat , Nixon found . But it is vital , he argues , that the U.S. should push ahead with the Camp David peace plan , that the Palestine Liberation Organization must recognize Israel 's right to exist ( " That can happen " ) and that this country " not allow a vacuum to be left on the Palestinian issue . " <P> " The U.S. is the only nation with influence on Israel , " Nixon says . " That must be exerted in Israel 's best interest . This hard line , that they 've won four wars and they will win the next one , is long-term disaster , eventually suicide . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
