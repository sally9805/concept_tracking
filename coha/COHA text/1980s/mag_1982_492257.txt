mong those who passed through the general clinic of Lenox Hill Hospital at Seventy-sixth Street and Park Avenue on an April Monday morning was a 40-year-old Yorkville dishwasher whom I will call Herman Sauer . His complaint , like his occupation , was an undistinguished one . He had a stomachache . The pain had seized him early Sunday evening , he told the examining physician , and although it was not unendurably severe , its persistence worried him . He added that he was diarrheic and somewhat nauseated . Also , his head hurt . The doctor took his temperature and the usual soundings . Neither disclosed any cause for alarm . Then he turned his attention to the manifest symptoms . The course of treatment he chose for their alleviation was unexceptionable . It consisted of a dose of bismuth subcarbonate , a word of dietetic advice and an invitation to come back the next day if the trouble continued . Sauer went home under the conforting impression that he was suffering from nothing more serious than a touch of dyspepsia . Sauer was worse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he stood up , he felt dazed and dizzy . He did not , however , return to Lenox Hill . Instead , with the inconstancy of the ailing , he made his way to Metropolitan Hospital on Welfare Island . He arrived there , shortly before noon , in such a state of confusion and collapse that a nurse had to assist him into the examining room . Half an hour later , having submitted to another potion of bismuth and what turned out to be an uninstructive blood count , he was admitted to a general ward for observation . During the afternoon , his temperature , which earlier had been , equivocally , normal , began to rise . When the resident physician reached him on his evening round , it was a trifle more than 103 ? . As is customary in all but the most crystalline cases , the doctor avoided a flatfooted diagnosis . In his record of the case , he suggested three compatible possibilities . One was aortitis , a heart condition caused by an inflammation of the great trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an admission of intemperance that had been wrung from Sauer in the examining room , were cirrhosis of the liver and gastritis due to alcoholism . At the moment , the doctor indicated , the last appeared to be the most likely . Gastritis , aortitis and cirrhosis of the liver , like innumerable other ailments , can seldom be repulsed by specific medication , but time is frequently effective . Sauer responded to neither . His fever held , and his symptoms multiplied . He itched all over , an edema sealed his eyes , his voice faded and failed , and the seething pains in his chest and abdomen advanced to his arms and legs . Toward the end of the week , he sank into a stony , comalike apathy . Confronted by this disturbing decline , the house physician reopened his mind and reconsidered the evidence . His adaptability was soon rewarded . He concluded that he was up against an acute and , to judge from his patient 's progressive dilapidation , a peculiarly rapacious infection . It was an insinuating notion , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable barometer of infection , and Sauer 's count had been entirely normal . On Wednesday , April 15 , the doctor requested that another count be made . He did not question the accuracy of the original test , but the thought had occurred to him that it might have been made prematurely . The report from the laboratory was on his desk when he reached the hospital the following day . It more than confirmed his hunch . It also relieved him simultaneously of both uncertainty and hope . Sauer 's white count was morbidly elevated by a preponderance of eosinophiles , a variety of cell that is produced by several potentially epidemic diseases but just one as formidably disheveling as the case in question . The doctor put down the report and called the hospital superintendent 's office . He asked the clerk who answered the phone to inform the Department of Health , to which the appearance of any disease of an epidemiological nature must be promptly communicated , that he had just uncovered a case of trichinosis . The cause of trichinosis is a voracious endoparasitic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodges in the muscle fibres of an animal host . It enters the host by way of the alimentary canal and , in the intestine , produces larvae that penetrate the intestinal walls to enter the blood stream . The worm is staggeringly prolific , and it has been known to remain alive , though quiescent , in the body of a surviving victim for 31 years . The number of trichinae that succeed in reaching the muscle determines the severity of the cases . As organisms go , adult trichinae are relatively large , the males averaging 1/20 of an inch in length and the females about twice that . The larvae are less statueque . Pathologists have found as many as 1,200 of them encysted in a single gram of tissue . Numerous animals , ranging in size from the mole to the hippopotamus , are hospitable to the trichina , but it has a strong predilection for swine and man . Man 's only important source of infection is pork . The disease is perpetuated in swine by the practice common among hog raisers of using garbage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Swine have a high degree of tolerance for the trichina , but man 's resistive powers are feeble . In 1931 , in Detroit , a man suffered a violent seizure of trichinosis as a result of merely eating a piece of bread buttered with a knife that had been used to slice an infested sausage . The hog from which the sausage was made had appeared to be in excellent health . Few acute afflictions are more painful than trichinosis or more prolonged and debilitating . Its victims are occasionally prostrated for many months , and relapses after apparent recoveries are not uncommon . Its mortality rate is disconcertingly variable . It is usually around six percent , but in some outbreaks nearly a third of those stricken have died , and the recovery of a patient from a full-scale attack is almost unheard of . Nobody is , or can be rendered , immune to trichinosis . Also , there is no specific cure . In the opinion of most investigators , it is far from likely that one will ever be found . They are persuaded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded trichinae would probably kill the patient , too . Although medical science is unable to terminate , or even lessen the severity of an assault of trichinosis , no disease is easier to dodge . There are several dependable means of evasion . Abstention from pork is , of course , one . It is also the most venerable , having been known , vigorously recommended and widely practiced for at least 3,000 years . Some authorities , in fact , regard the Mosaic proscription of pork as the pioneering step in the development of preventive medicine . However , since the middle of the 19th century , when the cause and nature of trichinosis were illuminated by Sir James Paget , Rudolf Virchow , Friedrich Albert von Zenker and others , less ascetic safeguards have become available . The trichinae are rugged but not indestructible . It has been amply demonstrated that thorough cooking ( until the meat is bone-white ) will make even the wormiest pork harmless . So will refrigeration at a maximum ternperature of five degrees for a minimum of 20 days . So , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking and pickling . Despite this abundance of easily applied defensive techiniques , the incidence of trichinosis has not greatly diminished over the globe in the past 50 or 60 years . In some countries , it has even increased . Trichinosis is generally believed to be a rarity . This view , though hallucinated , is not altogether without explanation . Outbreaks of trichinosis are seldom widely publicized . They are seldom even recognized . Trichinosis is the chameleon of diseases . Nearly all diseases are anonymous at onset , and many tend to resist identification until their grip is well established , but most can eventually be identified by patient scrutiny . Trichinosis is occasionally impervious to bedside detection at any stage . Even blood counts sometimes inexplicably fail to reveal its presence at any stage in its development . As a diagnostic deadfall , it is practically unique . The number and variety of ailments with which it is more or less commonly confused approach the encyclopedic . They include arthritis , acute alcoholism , conjunctivitis , food poisoning , lead poisoning , heart disease , laryngitis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myocarditis , gout , tuberculosis , angioneurotic edema , dermatomyositis , frontal sinusitis , influenza , nephritis , peptic ulcer , appendicitis , cholecystitis , malaria , scarlet fever , typhoid fever , paratyphoid fever , undulant fever , encephalitis , gastroenteritis , inter-coastal neuritis , tetanus , pleurisy , colitis , meningitis , syphilis , typhus and cholera . It has even been mistaken for beriberi . With all the rich inducements to error , a sound diagnosis of trichinosis is rarely made , and the diagnostician can not always take much credit for it . Often , as at Metropolitan Hospital that April day in 1942 , it is forced upon him . The report of the arresting discovery at Metropolitan reached the Health Department on the morning of Friday , April 17 . Its form was conventional  --  a postcard Continued on page 81 // continued from page 63 bearing a scribbled name , address and diagnosis  --  and it was handled with conventional dispatch . Within an hour , Dr. Morris Greenberg , who was then chief epidemiologist of the Bureau of Preventable Diseases , had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field epidemiologist named Lawrence Levy . Ten minutes after receiving the assignment , Dr. Levy was on his way to the hospital , intent on tracking down the source of the infection , with the idea of alerting the physicians of other persons who might have contracted the disease along with Sauer . At 11 o'clock , Dr. Levy walked into the office of the medical superintendent at Metropolitan . His immediate objective was to satisfy himself that Sauer was indeed suffering from trichinosis . He was quickly convinced . The evidence of the eosinophile count was now supported in the record by more graphic proof . Sauer , the night before , had undergone a biopsy . A sliver of muscle had been taken from one of his legs and examined under a microscope . It teemed with Trichinella spiralis . On the basis of the sample , the record noted , the pathologist who made the test estimated the total infestation of trichinae at upward of 12 million . A count of more than five million is almost invariably lethal . Dr. Levy returned the dossier to the file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had a word with the patient . He found him bemused but conscious . Sauer appeared at times to distantly comprehend what was said to him , but his replies were faint and rambling and mostly incoherent . At the end of five minutes , Dr. Levy gave up . He had n't learned much , but he had learned something , and he did n't have the heart to go on with his questioning . It was just possible , he let himself hope , that he had the lead he needed . Sauer had mentioned the New York Labor Temple , a German-American meeting-and-banquet hall on East Eighty-fourth Street , and he had twice uttered the word " Schlachtfest . A Schlachtfest , in Yorkville , the Doctor knew , is a pork feast . Before leaving the hospital , Dr. Levy telephoned Dr. Greenberg and dutifully related what he had found out . Itdid n't take him long . Then he had a sandwich and a cup of coffee and headed for the Labor Temple , getting there at a little past one . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , a few doors west of Second Avenue , with a high , ornately balustraded stoop and a double basement . Engraved on the facade , just above the entrance , is a maxim : " Knowledge Is Power . " In 1942 , the Temple was owned and operated , on a nonprofit basis , by the Workmen 's Educational Association ; it has since been acquired by private interests and is now given over to business and light manufacturing . A porter directed Dr. Levy to the manager 's office , a cubicle at the end of a dim corridor flanked by meeting rooms . The manager was in and , after a spasm of bewilderment , keenly cooperative . He brought out his records and gave Dr. Levy all the information he had . Sauer was known at the Temple . He had been employed there off and on for a year or more as a dishwasher and general kitchen helper , the manager related . He was one of a large group of lightly skilled wanderers from which the cook was accustomed to recruit a staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Temple on the nights of March 27 and March 28 . On the latter , as it happened , the occasion was a Schlachtfest . Dr. Levy , aware that the incubation period of trichinosis is usually from seven to 14 days and that Sauer had presented himself at Lenox Hill on April 6 , motioned to the manager to continue . The Schlachtfest had been given by the Hindenburg Pleasure Society , an informal organizationwhose members and their wives gathered periodically at the Temple for an evening of singing and dancing and overeating . The arrangements for the party had been made by the secretary of the society  --  Felix Lindenhauser , a name which , like those of Sauer and the others I shall mention in connection with the Schlachtfest , is a fictitious . one . Lindenhauser lived in St. George , on Staten Island . The manager 's records did not indicate where the pork had been obtained . Probably , he said , it had been supplied by the society . That was frequently the case . The cook would know , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The implication of this statement was not lost on Dr. Levy . Then the cook , he asked , was well ? The manager said that he appeared to be . Having absorbed this awkward piece of information , Dr. Levy inquired about the health of the others who had been employed in the kitchen on the night of March 28 . The manager did n't know . His records showed , however , that , like Sauer , none of them had worked at the Temple since that night . He pointed out that it was quite possible , of course , that they had n't been asked to . Dr. Levy noted down their names  --  Rudolf Nath , Henry Kuhn , Frederick Kreisler and William Ritter  --  and their addresses . Nath lived in Queens , Kreisler in Brooklyn and Kuhn and Ritter in the Bronx . Then Dr. Levy settled back to await the arrival of the cook . The cook turned up at three , and he , too , was very cooperative . He was feeling fine , he said . He remembered the Schlachtfest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the society . Some of it had been ground up into sausage and baked . The rest had been roasted . All of it had been thoroughly cooked . He was certain of that . The sausage , for example , had been boiled for two hours before it was baked . He had eaten his share of both . He supposed that the rest of the help had , too , but there was no knowing . He had neither seen nor talked to any of them since the night of the feast . There had been no occasion to , he said . Dr. Levy returned to his office , and sat there for a while in meditation . Presently , he put in a call to Felix Lindenhauser , the secretary of the society , at his home on Staten Island . Continued on page 84 Lindenhauser answered the telephone . Dr. Levy introduced himself and stated his problem . Lindenhauser was plainly flabbergasted . He said he was in excellent health and had been for months . His wife , who had accompanied him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of no illness in the society . He could n't believe that there had been anything wrong with that pork . It had been delicious . The pig had been obtained by two members of the society , George Muller and Hans Breit , both of whom lived in the Bronx . They had bought it from a farmer of their acquaintance in New Jersey . Lindenhauser went on to say that there had been 27 people at the feast , including himself and his wife . The names and addresses of the company were in his minute book . He fetched it to the phone and patiently read them off as Dr. Levy wrote them down . If he could be of any further help , he added as he prepared to hang up , just let him know , but he was convinced that Dr. Levy was wasting his time . At the moment , Dr. Levy was almost inclined to agree with him . Dr. Levy spent an increasingly uneasy weekend . He was of two antagonistic minds . He refused to believe that Sauer 's illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hindenburg Pleasure Society . On the other hand , it did n't seem possible that it was . Late Saturday afternoon , at his home , he received a call that increased his discouragement , if not his perplexity . It was from his office . Metropolitan Hospital had called to report that Herman Sauer was dead . Dr. Levy put down the receiver with the leaden realization that , good or bad , the Schlachtfest was now the only lead he would ever have . On Monday , Dr. Levy buckled heavily down to the essential but unexhilarating task of determining the health of the 27 men and women who had attended the Schlachtfest . Although his attitude was halfhearted , his procedure was methodical , unhurried and objective . He called on and closely examined each of the guests , including the Lindenhausers.and from each procured a sample of blood for analysis in the Health Department laboratories . The job , necessarily involving a good deal of leg work and many evening visits , took him the better part of two weeks . He ended up , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings were provocative but contradictory . Of the 27 who had feasted together on the night of March 28 , 25 were in what undeniably was their normal state of health . Two , just as surely , were not . The exceptions were George Muller and Hans Breit , the men who had provided the pig . Muller was at home and in bed , suffering sorely from what his family physician had uncertainly diagnosed as some sort of intestinal upheaval . Breit was in as bad a way , or worse , in Fordham Hospital . He had been admitted there for observation on April 10 . Several diagnoses had been suggested , including rheumatic myocarditis , pleurisy and grippe , but none had been formally retained . The nature of the two men 's trouble was no mystery to Dr. Levy . Both , as he was subsequently able to demonstrate , had trichinosis . On Friday morning , May 1 , Dr. Levy returned to the Bronx for a more searching word with Muller . Owing to Muller 's debilitated condition on the occasion of Dr. Levy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical in character . Muller , who was now up and shakily about , received him warmly . Since their meeting several days before , he said , he had been enliveningthe tedious hours of illness with reflection . A question had occurred to him . Would it be possible , he inquired , to contract trichinosis from just a few nibbles of raw pork ? It would , Dr. Levy told him . He also urged him to be more explicit . Thus encouraged , Muller displayed an unexpected gift for what appeared to be total recall . He leisurely recounted to Dr. Levy that he and Breit had bought the pig from a farmer who owned a place near Midvale , New Jersey . The farmer had killed and dressed the animal , and they had delivered the carcass to the Labor Temple kitchen on the evening of March 27 . That , however , had been only part of their job . Not wishing to trouble the cook and his helpers , who were otherwise occupied , Muller and Breit had then set about preparing the sausage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , and explained the process  --  grinding , maccrating and seasoning  --  in laborious detail . Dr. Levy began to fidget . Naturally , Muller presently went on , they had been obliged to sample their work . There was no other way to make sure that the meat was properly seasoned . He had taken perhaps two or three little nibbles . Breit , who had a heartier taste for raw pork , had probably eaten a trifle more . It was hard to believe , Muller said , that so little  --  just a pinch or two  --  could cause such misery . He had thought his head would split , and the pain in his legs had been almost beyond endurance . Dr. Levy returned him sympathetically to the night of March 27 . They had finished with the sausage around midnight , Muller remembered . The cook had departed by then , but his helpers were still at work . There had been five of them . He did n't know their names , but he had seen all or most of them again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Breit had given them any of the sausage before they left . But it was possible , of course , since the refrigerator in which he and Breit had stored the meat was not , like some , equipped with a lock .... Dr. Levy spent the rest of the morning in the Bronx . After lunch , he hopped over to Queens . From there , he made his way to Brooklyn . It was past four by the time he got back to his office . He was hot and gritty from a dozen subway journeys , and his legs ached from pounding pavements and stairs and hospital corridors , but he had tracked down and had a revealing chat with each of Sauer 's kitchen colleagues , and his heart was light . Three of them  --  William Ritter , Rudolf Nath and Frederick Kreisler  --  were in hospitals . Ritter was at Fordham , Nath at Queens General and Kreisler at the Coney Island Hospital , not far from his home in Brooklyn . The fourth member of the group , Henry Kuhn , was sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrect diagnoses , all were in more discomfort than danger , and all were suffering from trichinosis . They had prowled the icebox after the departure of Muller and Breit , come upon the sausage meat and helped themselves . They thought it was hamburger . Before settling down at his desk to compose the final installment of his report , Dr. Levy looked in on Dr. Greenberg . He wanted , among other things , to relieve him of the agony of suspense . Dr. Greenberg gave him a chair , a cigarette and an attentive ear . At the end of the travelogue , he groaned . " Did n't they even bother to cook it ? " he asked . " Yes , most of them did , " Dr. Levy said . " They made it up into patties and fried them . Kuhn cooked his fairly well . A few minutes , at least . The others liked theirs rare . All except Sauer . He ate his raw . " " Oh , " Dr. Greenberg said . " Also , " Dr. Levy added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
