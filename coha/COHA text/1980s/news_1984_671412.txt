Drawings and writings spread over the walls and ceilings . Life-size bodies float in the air . Paintings and paintings cut in half , in two dimensions and three , confront us in strange placements . Giant motorized figures make repetitive hammering motions , smaller ones waggle their jaws as they speak taped babble and a large , hermaphrodite clown-dancer twirls a foot as it sings " My Way . " Blinking lights assail the eye and taped cacophonies , the ear . It ' s a space so " activated " that it makes " Star Wars " look static. // Circus , happening , fun house , Disneyland , shopping center , theater , vaudeville and university of the streets , Borofsky ' s sensory overload works away at the spectator , aggressively confronting him with the artist ' s thoughts and fantasies on everything from nuclear war to a high school election he once lost . Aspiringly cosmic and autobiographically local , the show is all about Borofsky ( as a stand-in for ourselves ) , and it sends flying the notion of art as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cajoles , jabbers and cavorts , sometimes - as in the case of an enormous , sprawly humanoid of plastic bubble wrap that pulsates in a kind of rhythmic obeisance - literally getting down on its knees to the viewer. // Borofsky ' s drive is to make art less " arty , " overturn its formal devices , allow it a social-political voice . It ' s a 1960 ' s vision ( he was born in 1942 ) of art as " engaged , " accessible , anti- elite , and Borofsky , a clever and audacious showman , has given it full body . Any means of expression will do for him . Though trained in the conventional academies , he ' s unencumbered by traditional notions of style or continuity . He can draw with virtuosity - drawing is , in fact , his strength - or rough out a thought with the crudeness of a child . An ambitious graphic display is his giant- scale rendering , over two walls and into the Whitney ' s egg-crate ceiling , of a fierce dog with a bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - inspired by the political situation of East Berlin . On the other hand , there ' s a small , cute sketch that expresses every male artist ' s penis envy : two figures , one smaller than the other , and the scrawl , " I dreamed I was taller than Picasso. " // // // Borofsky ' s concerns are reflected in other mediums . A playable Ping- Pong table , for instance , reveals his nuclear anxieties . Its opposing fields stand for the Soviet Union and the United States , and a painted legend refers to their competitive arms budgets . On a video screen , a puppetlike figure with rabbit ears ( a Borofsky trademark , they signify his antennalike attunement to the cosmos ) flies apart and comes together again , perhaps a symbol of destruction and rebirth. // A humorous awareness of the gender gap is evident in such paintings as " Male Aggression Now Playing Everywhere , " in which a male figure sports arrows , rockets , knives and guns for genitalia . And then there are the strange , motorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and painted black ; dynamic motifs - and the boldest imagery here - that suggest both work and violence . One thing about Borofsky : he lets his dichotomies hang out. // In what might be called the educational part of the show , he engagingly acquaints us with his life in art , starting from the age of 8 . We see his progress through art schools , his emergence from youthful imitation , his retreat , during the Conceptual 60 ' s , from imagery to an obsessive but " pure " concern with counting ( as evidenced by a high stack of graph- paper sheets enshrined in a plastic vitrine . ) And then we can witness , via a joined series of canvases , his return from this pursuit ( which from this end seems like a trivial one ) to imagery again , although the counting continues , and every object Borofsky makes is assigned a number from his current reckoning - the count and the art explained as two aspects of his psyche , the rational and the intuitive. // The space he has activated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ' s hit us with a kind of theater-of-the-self that remains the work of an idea man and impresario - by no means an esthetic innovator - for whom art and autobiography unabashedly coincide . His outlook is very human and easy to love , and if one wishes that he had more esthetic discipline , that he were a better painter , a deeper conceptualizer and a less flashy entertainer , one is asking for another kind of artist . The theater of Borofsky is his style , and at creating it , he ' s awfully good. // Organized by Richard Marshall , associate curator of exhibitions at the Whitney , and Mark Rosenthal , curator of 20th-century art at the Philadelphia Museum , " Jonathan Borofsky " is supported by grants from the Pew Memorial Trust and the National Endowment for the Arts , and sponsored at the Whitney , where the show will be through March 10 , by the American Can Company . It will then travel to Minneapolis , Berkeley , Calif. , and Washington. // // // Also of interest this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 724 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street ) : Big , brushy forms , explosive color and fanciful imagery mark Roberto Juarez as one of the New Wave Expressionist breed , subtropical division . He likes to paint lush jungle life and tribal deities , but he also beachcombs the shores of modernist art for material. // Marsden Hartley and even Delaunay , for instance , combine with south-of-the-border subject matter in a wonderfully vivid painting , " Three Birds . " In it , three big , flatly rendered birds , densely plumaged in green and black touched with other hues , hover over brightly colored floral disks , the whole extravagant image contained by a staid , horizontally striped field of sky blue. // In another strong painting , " The Rattle , " a ceremonial bird appears on either side of a central shamanistic device , set in shallow space against a rhythmic sequence of patterned vertical panels . Juarez sets up an interesting tension of loose , easy forms confined by tight composition . But sometimes , as in the still life " Solo Ivory , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // <> <> " Dolls and Other Effigies " ( New Math Gallery , 508 East 12th Street ) : The word " doll " has been interpreted rather freely in this well-stocked show of work by young artists from New York and Houston , and most of the specimens don ' t really lend themselves to cuddling . Occurring in all sizes and various melds of woman , man and beast , they take their inspiration from witchcraft , cultism , fetishism , eroticism and other credos , laced with light and dark humor. // " The Tailing Eye , " a wall piece by Kiell Erik Killi Olsen , is a serpentine humanoid , whose long body , painted sparkling blue , is explored by a jolly green alligator , and whose curling tail sports an eye . It dangles by a string an infant replica of itself . Somewhat less frolicsome is Chris Bothwell ' s " Baby , " a corpulent monster of viscous white resin , rubber and plaster , that stands on a chair to regard itself in a mirror , yet. // Max Pruneda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an appealing , russet-colored melange of twigs and feathers with an old man ' s wizened face . A wild wit informs " The President Head Woman , " by Bill Haveron , a cut-out wooden plaque that depicts a bikini- clad swinger disdainfully eyeing a sober row of United States Presidential heads painted along her arm , and five house-shaped cutouts placed at various body points that tell a satirical boy-girl tale . As for Bronsen Eden ' s X-rated " Sex Toy " - sorry ; it can ' t be described here . But it gives the word " toy " a new dimension . Many other enticements can be found in this pungent show , among them pieces by Greer Lankton , William Rutherford , Steve Daughton , Jane Waltzer and Patrice Davis . ( Through Jan. 13. ) // // <> <> George Condo ( Barbara Gladstone Gallery , 152 Wooster Street ) : A satirical eye for royal trappings gives George Condo ' s paintings a certain pizazz . He paints flashy jewelry , ostentatious swords that take on a regal persona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects , as in " Portrait of the American Farmer . " Here , a crown of gold is jammed on top of the farmer ' s straw hat , and his body is an inverted cone of black velvet drapery embellished with a string of outscale beads . The best things are his small , painterly renderings of medieval types , such as " The Albatross , " in which a jester in a ruffed , red velvet doublet stares down his Pinocchio nose at a stalwart bird that has perched on the tip of it . On the level of fairy-tale illustration , the work has its charms .

And , in a corner , hang " clouds " ingeniously made of silk scarfs . Two silhouettes , in black , of women with parasols , appear on a third wall . These flat elements are organized , so to speak , by the dimensional spokes of the giant wheel , through which we perceive them . A haiku , one might call this work , pleasant but mysterious . ( Through Jan. 6. ) // // <> <> Simon Carr ( Bowery Gallery , 121 Wooster Street ) : Simon Carr paints hunting and fishing scenes in Expressionist colors of contrasting value - as in " Dropping Off Supplies : Green Island , " in which a dark figure is silhouetted against a blazing orange sky and sparkling blue-green water . His strong color sense is the best thing about these paintings . ( Through Jan. 16. ) // //                   @ @
