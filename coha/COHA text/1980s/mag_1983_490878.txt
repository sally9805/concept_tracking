Surrogate 's Court Hall of Records , New York , N.Y ? December 10 . LW , 10 t.Ai . In the Matter of the Last Vs ill and Testament of Eleanor Morgan Satterlec . Before : Hon. George Frankenthaler , Surrogate , and a Jury . ( Summation by Mr. Rifkind on behalf of the proponent . ) MR . RIFKIND : May it please your Honor , ladies and gentlemen of the jury : When  --  ever in the course of my professional work it comes my turn to address a jury , I am always filled with a sense of elation . I am filled with elation because , although I am speaking now to a small audience , in that audience I see a cross-section of our country . Between Mr. Auerbach and Miss Krowther , in One and Two places , and Mr. Sudholl and Mr. Boyd , in the last two places in this box , I see men and women from every kind of origin , from every kind of social background , from every kind of economic position  --  really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems that we have been discussing here for the last six weeks are going to be left to the decision of this group of men and women , I know that I am experiencing democracy at work , and democracy living , because no man has a right in ask more than that his problem and his controversy should be submitted for decision by his neighbors , fairly selected , free from bias and prejudice , but his neighbors .... What we are fighting here . what is in controversy here , is something far more precious than money : reputation  --  the reputation of a girl who is dead , and the reputation of ... professional men whom you have seen , who have served their country well , and who are here being chal  --  lenged in a way that jeopardizes their professional lives . You heard Mr. McGrath for the con  --  testant ask Colonel Rosenblatt whether he regarded this case seriously , and you remember his answer , that this was the most serious thing in his life . That was no exaggeration . No professional man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I would suppose that no battle he has ever engaged in , battles for which he has won the battle stars of his country , was for him personally more important than the battle that he has waged during the past six weeks in this courtroom against the accusations of Mabel Ingalls with the assistance of the House of Morgan . I spoke of the reputation of a girl , Elea  --  nor Morgan Satterlec . Her cause in this courtroom is being championed by Colonel Rosenblatt .... And all I can say to you in apology for these long weeks of trial is that , although this was scheduled as a will contest , in which the only question is whether a piece of paper is the true will of the person who signed it before subscribing witnesses , as the trial progressed I found myself defending a murder case , an em ADVOCATE Sinion Hirsch Rifkind bezzlement case , an alienation of affec  --  tions case , a kidnapping case : every accusa  --  tion in the calendar was thrown quite recklessly , I think  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons who have heretofore done nothing to warrant such accusations . THE case concerned the will of a granddaughter of J. P. Mor  --  gan , Eleanor Morgan Satterlee , who had executed the will before wit  --  nesses at the Sulgrave Hotel , in Man  --  hattan , on November 3 , 1950 , and had died of cancer the following April . The will was challenged by Mabel In  --  galls  --  Eleanor Satterlee 's sister  --  with the support of the firm of J. P. Mor  --  gan &; Company , which was named in it as co-executor . Mrs. Ingalls had al  --  leged through her lawyer , John P. McGrath , that the will had been made when the testator was not competent to do so . She had further alleged that Sol A. Rosenblatt  --  a retired colonel in the United States Army , Mrs. Sat  --  terlee 's lawyer , a co-executor of the will , and , not incidentally , an impor  --  tant beneficiary of it  --  had exercised undue influence on the testator in his own favor in the preparation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasten her death through the withholding of medical care . Counsel for Colonel Rosenblatt , the proponent of the will , was Simon Hirsch Rifkind , a small , trim lawyer with round spec  --  tacles and a small Charlie Chaplin mustache , who over the years has repeatedly been singled out by his peers as the greatest courtroom advocate of his time and perhaps the greatest all-around lawyer of his time . In various respects  --  the references by name to several of the jurors , the appeal to the glories of American de  --  mocracy , the insistence that the real subject of the case was not money but reputation , and the air of sweet rea  --  sonableness played in counterpoint to a tone of fierce argumentation  --  the pas  --  sage above , Rifkind 's introduction to his summation of his case to the jury , represents a fair sample of his court  --  room style , which has been character  --  ized by one of his law partners , Jay Topkis , as that of " a great storyteller who always puts things in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Douglas , in his book " The Court Years , " named Rifkind as " the most outstanding advocate of all " in the nation , and the senior among Rifkind 's partners , Lloyd K. Garri  --  son , has called him quite simply " the finest lawyer we shall ever know . " Rifkind 's detractors among lawyers who have worked with him , or argued against him , accuse him of deliberately debasing his intellectual gifts in the interest of persuading judges and juries to his clients ' points of view , and some judges who have listened to his court  --  room dramas give them mixed or un  --  favorable notices , finding them to be too corny . Rifkind himself might he inclined to go along with these criti  --  cisms . Of the Satterlee case  --  which he won hands clown  --  Rifkind says , " That was a perfect courtroom drama , the kind of thing I would want to write fiction about if I could write fiction . I am , I guess , a bit of a ham , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At eighty-one , Rifkind can look back on an unusually varied career in the law  --  a career marked by a pen  --  chant for being in the thick of not only many of the most important but also some of the more diverting public events of his time . From 1927 to 1933 , he was chief assistant to Senator Rob  --  ert F. Wagner , of New York , and played a key role in the shaping of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal . He was involved in investigating the strange disappearance , in 1930 , of Judge Joseph Force Crater . From 1941 until 1950 , he served as a federal judge in New York City . Since then , he has been a leading member and the driving force of the celebrated law firm of Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Whar = ton &; Garrison . Comparatively few good judges make good advocates , and vice versa , evidently because the mind and temperament required by the two callings are so different . Rifkind is an exception ; having won high praise for his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acclaim as a litigator . Temperamentally , though , his heart may always have been in the latter role . Rifkind as a judge could render balanced judgment , but he was born to argue in court . Vigorous or ruthless advocacy for a fee is , of course , one of the things that have tended to make lawyers as a group unpopular down through the ages . It was probably what made St. Luke write , " Woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers . " It was certainly in the mind of Thorstein Vebien when he wrote , with characteristic exaggeration , in " The Theory of the Leisure Class , " " The lawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of predatory fraud , either in achieving or in checkmating chicane . " Moreover , hardly anyone in the laity likes a constant arguer , much less a highly effective one , and arguing constantly and effectively is what litigation is . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services when they have a dispute of their own . ( As far as Rifkind 's firm is concerned , they pay at rates ranging from eighty dollars an hour for the lowest-paid associates up to three hundred dollars an hour for the highest-paid partners . ) A problem for many lawyers is that of giving their best efforts to cases and causes that they themselves have trouble be  --  lieving in . Rifkind seems to have solved this problem through a kind of self-hypnosis . Topkis says , " Once he has taken a client on , he becomes to  --  tally dedicated to his cause . Rifkind has represented a lot of sinners . That is , they may have been sinners when they walked through his door , but as soon as he accepted their cases , to him they became angels . At that moment , he stopped being able to see their flaws . The flaws became ' problems . ' I 've rep  --  resented some sinners myself  --  and so have others at Paul , Weiss  --  but I must say I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of self-persuasion that Si Rifkind has . " Rifkind himself lays down two prin  --  principal requirements for successful liti  --  gation : " One : Litigation is conducted on a public stage in the presence of a sophisticated audience . You can not fool the fans . They know quality or the absence of it when they see it . Two : Litigation is an emotional expe  --  rience . It calls for identification with the client . I have never seen a great actor who did not identify with the character he impersonated . The same is true of a successful litigator . " Rif-kind takes a romantic view of the courtroom itself . " In the courtroom , I have seen courage in the face of odds , " he said some years back . " I have seen steadfastness in adversity . I have seen magnanimity in victory . In the court  --  room , the lawyer enjoys the exhilara  --  tion of victory and suffers the chasten  --  ing of defeat . " Among the cases that during his thirty-three years with Paul , Weiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy ( later Onassis ) against the writer William Manches  --  ter , concerning the latter 's book about the death of President Kennedy ; that of the New York Post and its then edi  --  tor , Tames Wechsler , against the columnist and commentator Walter Winchell , on the arresting allegation that Winchell , in calling Wechsler an " ex-Communist " in his newspaper column and in broadcasts , had so load  --  ed this pronouncement with innuendo that by implication he was calling him a Communist ; and that of Mine . Chiang Kai-shek , wife of the Chinese Nationalist Generalissimo , who had been mentioned in what she considered to be a defamatory way in a book by Drew Pearson . The Paul , Weiss firm , in a description of itself recently sub  --  mitted to " The American Lawyer Guide to Leading Law Firms , " said , with evident pride , " Rifkind helped earn the firm 's litigation reputation with his involvement in highly pub  --  licized cases . " Partly as a result of that involvement , over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mentioned frequently in newspaper gossip columns  --  in his case , par  --  ticularly that of Leonard Lyons in the Post . But Rifkind is scarcely either a publicity seeker or a bon vivant . Some more relaxed members of his profes  --  sion call him a " workaholic " whose idea of a vacation is to come into the office on Sunday afternoon wearing a sports coat . He dines out infrequently , is at his desk ten or twelve hours a day when he is n't in court , and throughout his career has avoided press interviews ( although he did once or twice vol  --  unteer thoughts of a more or less scholarly nature to Lyons for inclusion in his column ) . In fact , most of his important cases have been intricate in their legal content and consequently less appealing to the public . These in  --  clude his defense , in the nineteen-fifties , of various American oil com  --  panies against a charge that they had conspired to boycott imports of oil from Iran ; his work on behalf of Jus  --  tice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his role in the formation of the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York in 1975 ; and his role  --  not as an ad  --  vocate hut , rather , as a Special Master , or quasi-judge , appointed by the Unit  --  ed States Supreme Court  --  in the his  --  toric case , which ran from 1952 to 1963 , concerning the apportionment of the waters of the Colorado River among Arizona , California , and other Western states . Surely one of Rifkind 's most notable ? accomplishments has been his leader  --  ship in transforming the Paul , Weiss firm from a modest affair into one of the most formidable legal juggernauts in the country . When he arrived , in 1950 , it consisted of thirty-seven law  --  yers , including partners and associates , and only one of the partners was regu  --  larly engaged in litigation ; the firm was known chiefly as a specialist in such matters as theatrical and tax law . Now its roster includes two hundred and fifty-four lawyers  --  seventy-one partners , one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emeri  --  tus status that lawyers call " of coun  --  sel . " A hundred and one lawyers are engaged full time in litigation , and the firm is best known for its prowess in that form of practice . Paul , Weiss peo  --  ple agree that Rifkind , far more than anyone else , was responsible for this transformation  --  and also that it was chiefly on his initiative that the firm came to include among its partners at one time or another such men of national fame as Adlai Stevenson , Arthur Goldberg , and Ramsey Clark . Perhaps to the bewilderment of some of the partners of longer standing than Rifkind himself , the former legislative aide and judge turned out to be not only a champion litigator but an em  --  pire builder , too . Paul Hoffman , in his book " Lions in the Street : The Inside Story of the Great Wall Street Law Firms , " wrote that Rifkind " excels as a courtroom battler ... an astute litigator , an ace business-getter , an able administra  --  tor " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch of Rifkind : " One hundred per cent law  --  yer  --  he eats , drinks , breathes the law ; he probably even dreams the law . " ( In fact , Paul , Weiss was never a " Wall Street law firm " in the sense of having a client list consisting almost exclu  --  sively of large corporations ; it did for  --  merly have its offices downtown , but in 1951 it became the first substantial general-practice firm to move from there to midtown . ) Along with its glowing professional reputation , the firm  --  and Rifkind in particular  --  has acquired in some quarters a less envi  --  able one as a ferocious fee-charger . For example , in December of 1978 , the Village Voice , noting that Paul , Weiss had charged New York City almost three million dollars for its help in setting up the Municipal Assistance Corporation , called Rifkind " probably the highest-priced lawyer in New York , " and in 1968 the New York City Bar Association put on a theatri  --  cal spoof of Rifkind and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tend to reinforce this reputation . In the late nineteen-sixties , when Ralph Nader sued the General Motors Corporation for invading his privacy by setting detectives on him , Rifkind represented General Motors . Asked recently whether he would have repre  --  sented Nader instead if Nader had ap  --  plied to him first , Rifkind replied , " Certainly  --  assuming that he could have paid my fee , which I doubt that he could have at the time . " The aston  --  ishing thing , in the light of this ap  --  parent financial savagery , is that ac  --  cording to the testimony of some of his partners Rifkind is scarcely interested at all in personal financial advantage . While he may be hardhearted with his clients , he is generous , at his own expense , with his partners . After all , a man who eats and drinks the law saves on restaurant and bar tabs . Robert II . Montgomery , Jr. , the head of Paul , Weiss 's renowned entertainment department , says , " It simply is n't so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere near that . Of course he charges high fees , but most of the money goes to the firm . Many New York lawyers take much more out of their firms every year than Si takes out of ours . In fact , there were many years when he could have taken out four or five times as much as he did . During my first ten years as a partner  --  I became one in 1961 ? Si made a personal gift to me of between one-third and one-half of my annual compensation . It was money that he was entitled to take himself but insisted that I have . The truth is that Si never had money ambi  --  tions for himself . What would he do with a lot of money ? What he really loves is the practice of law , and his ambition is not to be rich but to make his law firm the best there is . " RFKIND spent the first nine years of his life , 1901 to 1910 , in Meretz , Lithuania , in Imperial Russia  --  a vil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hillside overlooking the River Neman , which runs into the Baltic Sea . The Jewish inhabitants of Meretz spoke Yiddish ; their written language was Hebrew . Modern tech  --  nology had not reached the place : wa  --  ter was drawn from a common well and carried home in buckets suspended from shoulder harnesses , and houses were warmed by wood-burning ovens . During his years in Meretz , Rifkind never wore a factory-made garment and never saw a newspaper . Residents lived at subsistence level by conducting various small businesses ; Rifkind 's fa  --  ther , Jacob , the son of a Hebrew scribe in Grodno , sold fish he caught in nearby lakes . But the real occupation of Meretz in those days was waiting for a chance to emigrate . Of course , there are still thousands of living Americans who can look back on more or less similar early childhoods . Rifkind , with his flair for the dra  --  matic , sees the experience as a six  --  teenth-century window through which ? it has been his peculiar destiny  --  and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he said to a gathering of young Paul , Weiss as  --  sociates a year or so ago , " to you , I take it , an automobile is an indispens  --  ability ; to me it 's an amenity . To you air-conditioning is a necessity ; to me it 's a luxury . To you television and air travel are routine ; to me they are still miracles . . .. There is really only one universe in which I feel at ease with my young brethren , and that is the universe of the law . " Meanwhile , his view backward in time  --  three-quarters of a century of his time , several cen  --  turies of the world 's  --  is untinged with affection . " I never felt myself a native of that country , " he says . " I never learned its language , I never spoke to its people . I never thought of myself as Russian or Lithuanian . I 've never felt any desire to go hack . It was as if we were living as refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by degrees , the head of the family first . In Rifkind 's in  --  fancy , his father crossed the Atlantic in steerage and settled on the lower East Side , where he became a mer  --  chant of woollens ; the family 's two elder sons soon followed , and became store clerks . By 1910 , Jacob Rifkind had accumulated enough money to al  --  low the rest of the family  --  Rifkind 's mother , his two sisters , and himself  --  to make the Atlantic voyage outside steerage , and he sent the money for them to come . The reassembled fam ? ily 's first home in the land of gold-paved streets ( Rifkind had actual  --  ly heard that expression repeatedly in Meretz ) was a crowded tenement on Madison Street , near Catherine . Rifkind went to a Jewish religious school , where , during most of the day , instruction in the Talmud and related subjects was conducted in Hebrew , with a nod toward English grammar and composition , arithmetic , and American history in the late-afternoon hours . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeWitt Clin  --  ton High School ( then in Manhattan , at Fifty-ninth Street and Tenth Ave  --  nue ) , where he became fluent in En  --  glish , got used to associating with an ethnically mixed group , and , during the First World War , became the sort of fanatically patriotic American that most of Meretz had been in its day  --  dreams . At City College , which was in full flower as a place of initiation into the liberal arts for immigrants and chil  --  dren of immigrants , Rifkind became interested in philosophy , studying un  --  der Morris Raphael Cohen , whose thought was based on rigid logic , and Harry Overstreet , whose orientation was toward psychology . ( Inspired by the latter , Rifkind went to the New York Public Library to borrow Freud 's " The Interpretation of Dreams ; " he had to convince the director of the reading room that he was a serious student before he was allowed access to it . ) He graduated , a member of Phi Beta Kappa , in 1922 and was accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cambridge and Boston trying to find part-time em  --  employment so that he could pay his tui  --  tion , and had to abandon Harvard . Back in New York , he applied to Columbia Law School , which was al  --  ready two weeks into its fall session . The assistant dean , Young B. Smith , turned him down , on the grounds that he was too late and that , in any case , Columbia did n't " encourage people who are going to have to work to pay tuition . " Undeterred , Rifkind applied to Smith 's superior , Dean Harlan F. Stone ( later Chief Justice of the United States ) . Stone accepted him , whereupon Rifkind , who had taught Hebrew in his spare time during his high-school and college years , got a job as head of the religious school at Temple Bnai Israel , thirty blocks up Riverside Drive from Columbia . Thus began three grinding years of juggling law school with work to pay for it . Mornings , Rifkind attended his law classes . Afternoons , he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the outside work prevented him from serving on the Law Review and also forced him on some occasions to take the second half of a course be  --  fore he took the first half , in order to accommodate his work schedule . " The strain was intense , " Rifkind says of his law-school days . " There was no room for fun or play . I did n't get too much sleep . In order to get some exercise and spend some time outdoors , I took to horseback riding . I rode in Central Park every Satur  --  day morning . " Along with sleep , he missed the chance to watch actual trials , which already fascinated him , and to study at first hand the art of litigation . " In those days , you had no clinical education in advocacy , " he re  --  calls . " In law school , nobody ever mentioned the word ' courthouse . ' You just read cases . I never saw a case tried until I tried my first one . But all through law school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during the summer of 1923 , following his first year in law school , Rifkind embarked on that most American of a young American 's adventures , a camping trip across the country . His interest in what might lie west of the Hudson  --  unknown lands to him had been piqued by a classmate , William 0 . Douglas , who was destined to become his lifelong friend , and who had an  --  nounced himself as coming from a dis ? tant place that to Rifkind sounded comical , alluring , and imaginary : Walla Walla , Washington . Having acquired , for three hundred dollars , a tent and a Dodge equipped with a removable top and isinglass win  --  dows , he set out with another class  --  mate , Abraham Sainer , to see the coun  --  try . See it they did  --  the Midwest , the Great Plains , the Rocky Moun  --  tains , the Southwest , California , and Walla Walla . In those last years of America 's unsophistication , instead of multi-lane highways skirting the cit  --  ies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car was still new and strange . Although there were motels , in the form of primitive " tourist cab  --  ins , " and roadside restaurants , known as " diners , " the two law students usu  --  ally camped out and made fires to cook their meals . Rifkind was enchanted with the trip and came back feeling much more American . Soon after their return , Sainer arranged a double date for himself and Rifkind with a friend of his and her friend , a New York girl named Adele Singer . Shortly there  --  after , Sainer married his half of the double date ; four years later , in 1927 , Rifkind married his . Out of law school in June , 1925 , Rifkind was admitted to the bar the following year , and began casting about for a job . Law offices at the time did not recruit their associates ; essen  --  tial for an applicant were a letter of introduction , the patronage of a desir  --  able client , or , best of all , kinship with a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger firms were closed to Jews . ( As for women and blacks , there were very few in the profession , since hardly any were ad  --  mitted to the major law schools . ) Rifkind landed at a small firm on Wil  --  liam Street called Feiner &; Skutch , where for a few months he did the menial tasks that were the common lot of young lawyers without exceptional connections . Late that year , an un  --  usual opportunity came his way . Rob  --  ert F. Wagner , an immigrant from Germany and a regular Democrat with progressive leanings , had just been elected to the Senate , and , in search of someone to fill the position then called legislative secretary and now called administrative assistant , he consulted Huger W. Jervey , the dean of Columbia Law . Jervey recom  --  mended his recent graduate Rifkind . Rifkind accepted , over the objections of his earlier dean , Harlan Stone , who feared that Wagner was just another Tammany hack . Rifkind went to work for Wagner in his newly formed Washington of  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two stenographers . At the same time , he became associated with Wagner 's New York City law practice . ( In those days , when Con  --  congress was seldom in session more than three months a year and congressional pay was low , it was not only acceptable but often necessary for members to continue their commercial or profes  --  sional activities at home while serving in Congress . ) Rifkind divided his time between New York and Washington ? often , for reasons of economy , leav  --  ing his wife behind in New York dur  --  ing his Washington stays . A certain formality prevailed in Wagner 's office . Rifkind addressed him as " Senator , " and Wagner addressed Rifkind as " Rifkind . " Rifkind now says of Washington in those days , " It really was a pretty small-scale town , even by American standards of the time , and certainly in comparison with other world capitals . Why , it just was n't in the league . It did n't have a theatre ; occasionally a stock company would show up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have an orchestra ; occasionally some orchestra would pay a flying visit . Of course , it had no ballet . Its major attraction was a fairly popular burlesque house  --  a place made famous by the visits of Justice Holmes . In lieu of all those forms of intellectual enter  --  tainment , conversation was an art widely practiced , and visiting with one another was a very popular sport . Pennsylvania Avenue looked like a run-down fifth-rate street in a city the size of Pittsfield . " Pittsfield , perhaps , was the sort of place that Americans , with their distrust of big government , wanted their national capital to look like . Senator Wagner quickly developed a passion for the legislative life and be  --  gan neglecting his law practice , in which he had never been particularly interested . Rifkind , on the other hand , was interested both in legislation and in law practice and felt quite comfort  --  able wearing two hats and working long hours in two cities . In 1930 , Wagner 's law practice became a part  --  nership  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son-in-law of Alfred E. Smith , the former governor of New York who had been defeated as the Democratic candidate for President in 1928 ? and Rifkind hired Edythe Griffinger , a young woman from Newark , to be his secretary both in Wagner 's Senate of  --  fice and in the law firm in New York . In 1983 , Miss Griffinger  --  now a crisp , handsome , gray-haired lady  --  is still his secretary . She calls him " Judge " and he calls her " Gruff . " They have long since learned to communicate in a kind of oral short  --  hand , and relations between them are marked by terse exchanges , with no particular deference either way . " When I was first hired , I was on probation for three months , " Miss Griffinger says . " Well , you know , I 'm still on proba  --  tion . " I the same year , 1930 , there began a strange episode in Rifkind 's ca  --  reer  --  a sort of irrelevant yet somehow characteristic footnote . About the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired another lawyer as an office tenant , Joseph Force Crater . Crater  --  like Wagner himself a proud ? product of the Tammany political ma  --  chine  --  was a tall , long-necked man with a preference for conspicuously elegant dress . According to Rifkind , Crater was a brilliant lawyer , who taught him a lot about brief-writing . In April of 1930 , he became a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court . On the following August 6th  --  after being seen having dinner in a restaurant in the theatre district and subsequently getting into a taxi alone ? he disappeared . There was consid  --  erable delay in reporting Crater 's dis  --  appearance to the police . Rifkind learned that Crater 's law clerk had not reported it because , the clerk ex  --  plained , he suspected Crater , a married man , of being " on a date " and wanted to protect him from adverse publicity . Rifkind finally went to the police him  --  self and reported the Judge as a miss  --  ing person . A reward was offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held ( Rifkind was among those who testified ) , but Crater was never found . Rifkind 's subsequent occasions to recall the case have been laced with a kind of comedy  --  discordantly , in view of his respect and affection for Cra  --  ter . In August , 1937 , he and his wife were vacationing in Maine and de  --  cided to visit Mrs. Crater at her sum ? mer home in Belgrade Lakes . It was the seventh anniversary of Crater 's disappearance , and several members of the press were also at Belgrade Lakes and were staying at the same hotel as the Rif kinds . By coincidence , the chief of the New York City Police Depart  --  ment 's Homicide Squad was there as well . The press decided something was up , and when the Rifkinds left the hotel to drive to Mrs. Crater 's house they found themselves at the head of a procession of cars occupied by a covey of reporters , including the Hearst col  --  umnist Dorothy Kilgallen . Rifkind threw the followers off the scent by turning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in 1971 the New York City Bar Association re  --  ceived a letter from a conscientious but ill-informed New York City police in  --  spector in the Missing Persons Squad , who wrote requesting any information the Association might have as to Judge Crater 's whereabouts , adding that another person being sought was " Simon Rifkin sic , Attorney , for  --  merly of 120 Broadway , New York City , complainant who filed the Miss  --  ing Persons report . " Rifkind remarked to a Times reporter , " If they ca n't find me , how could they ever find Crater ? " Rifkind himself has given up hope that Crater will be Found or his fate known , but he still insists that specula  --  tion about improper conduct on Cra  --  ter 's part is gratuitous and inappropri  --  ate . The Judge , he says , was " a man of impeccable manners and propriety , " and he adds , " If you live as closely with a man as I did with Crater and he has unsavory innards , you discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbert Hoover , Senator Wagner concentrated on economic legislation  --  especially on measures with the then avant-garde purposes of encouraging the organized-labor movement and counteracting the business cycle  --  and gradually he be  --  came the prototype of the Northern urban liberal . Under his direction , Rifkind worked on these bills , which were defeated with monotonous regu  --  larity by the Republican-controlled Congress . Finding himself in a field in which he had no training or experi  --  ence  --  his education had been in phi  --  losophy and law , not in the social sciences  --  Rifkind set about establish  --  ing a nationwide network of profes  --  sional and academic social scientists to provide him with ideas and informa  --  tion ; among them was Paul H. Douglas , a professor of economics at the University of Chicago , who later , after he had become a senator from Il  --  linois , said that his contacts with Rifkind in the late nineteen-twenties had been a factor in his becoming fascinated with the legislative process and wanting to be a part of it . The onset of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash of 1929 , made Wagner 's economic ideas more attractive to Congress but seldom to Hoover . Wagner proposed a two-billion-dollar public-works pro  --  gram , a permanent federal body for long-range public-works planning , a federal employment service , a federal system for collecting labor statistics , and a federal system of unemployment insurance . Two of the less crucial of these proposals  --  those for long-range planning and for labor-statistics gath  --  ering  --  were eventually enacted , in somewhat watered-down form , during the Hoover Administration ; the others were vetoed by Hoover or blocked by Congress . The coming of a liberal President and Congress in March , 1933 , naturally meant a sharp im  --  provement in the climate for Wagner 's ideas . It also marked the end of Wag  --  ner 's first term as senator ( he had been elected to a second term the previous November ) and the end of Rifkind 's commitment to serve him as secretary . Accordingly , following the Inaugura  --  tion of Roosevelt as President on March 4th , Rifkind went straight to the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full time to prac  --  ticing law and to be with his family ? now including a two-year-old son , Richard  --  whom he felt he had been neglecting . He had scarcely arrived home , and was still wearing his over  --  coat , when the telephone rang and Wagner informed him that President Roosevelt had called Congress into special session and that his presence was required in Washington immedi  --  ately . Picking up his suitcase , he re  --  turned , and he remained until mid-June ; in the interim , he made his most memorable legislative contribu  --  tion , the famous language of Section 7(a) of the National Industrial Recov  --  ery Act . The National Industrial Recovery Act , which created the National Re  --  covery Administration , , or N.R.A. , had been in gestation for some time . As early as the spring of 1931 , Rifkind , stimulated by Wagner , had begun studying possible conflicts be  --  tween the process of industrial recov  --  ery and the anti-trust laws as they were then administered . That same year , various leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gen  --  eral Electric , had suggested the estab  --  lishment of industry-wide " codes of fair competition , " which would autho  --  rize , in apparent contravention of the anti-trust laws , the maintenance of prices through price-fixing and re  --  striction of production and would ben  --  efit the worker directly by establishing maximum work hours and minimum pay scales . Such codes were to be vol  --  untary , but once they were adopted by industry and approved by government authorities they would have the force of law . Even President Hoover , in his December , 1931 , State of the Union Message , went as far as to propose that Congress launch an investigation of the possibilities for such a law . Neither that nor anything else of a concrete nature was done on the matter during the crisis year of 1932 , but a few weeks after Roosevelt 's Inauguration the new President gave Wagner the go-ahead to prepare a bill , and work on one rose to fever pitch . Rifkind became a key member of various groups of economists , bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and peo  --  ple from the new Administration , all working on the hill . He found himself in meetings that ran through most of the day and long into the night . In particular , it fell to Rifkind to write what became Section 7(a) , which de  --  clared  --  in language that still sounds like poetry to partisans of American labor  --  that every industrial code must provide , among other things , that " employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing , and shall be free from the interference , restraint , or coercion of employers . . . in the designation of such representatives . " Once written into the bill , Section 7(a) , which gave a broader sanction than ever before for the organization and growth of unions in the United States , became its most controversial part . From the moment Wagner in  --  troduced the bill , on May 17 , 1933 , much of industry lobbied furiously against the section 's inclusion , and some proponents of the legislation were ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage . But Wagner held firm . " No 7(a) , no bill , " he told one group of conferees , and on June 16th the National Industrial Recovery Act became law with Section 7(a) in  --  cluded . While the anti-competitive aspects of the act achieved a mixed record on bringing about industrial recovery , the impetus to unionization provided by 7(a) made its passage a landmark event for labor . Union membership rose more than twenty per cent by the end of 1934 , and one major union , the United Mine Workers , in  --  creased its membership more than eightfold between the passage of the act and May of 1935 , when the Su  --  preme Court found the act unconstitu  --  tional on the ground that it involved excessive delegation of powers by Con gress . By that time , for better or worse , the great Age of the Union in American life had dawned . Nor did Rifkind 's words in Section 7(a) then disappear from United States law ; they reappear , in greatly elaborated form , in the National Labor Relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for unions and unionization in America . Rifkind finally left his Washington post for good on the day that the Senate passed the National Industrial Recovery Act , and one week before Roosevelt signed it into law . ( He was succeeded as Wagner 's assistant by the young lawyer and economist Leon H. Keyserling , who was later to become chairman of President Truman 's Council of Economic Advisers . ) Looking back now on his work in the act 's preparation , Rifkind says , " We were much concerned with the prob  --  lem of delegation of legislative power to the code writers . We worried about whether that was constitutional or not . We took a chance . Then again , when Hugh Johnson became N.R.A . head and announced his program I was shaken . We had thought of maybe ten industrial codes in the biggest indus  --  tries  --  steel , rubber , and so on . We had n't envisaged a great national pub  --  lic-relations campaign  --  remember the N.R.A . Blue Eagle ? ? or every pants presser and whatnot coming under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . But by the time the Court knocked down the Blue Eagle the law had achieved its highly beneficial purposes . Thus I learned the uses of unconstitutional legislation . " Back in New York , Rifkind set about being a full-time lawyer , as de-facto head of what was nominally Wagner 's firm . In the late nineteen-twenties , the firm had gained a reputa  --  tion in labor law when , representing the subway workers ' union against the Interborough Rapid Transit Com  --  pany , it persuaded the courts , for the first time , that the notorious " yellow-dog contract , " in which a worker agreecLnot to join a union while in the company 's employ , was legally unen  --  forceable  --  thereby virtually ending use of yellow-dog contracts in New York State . ( Those who worked on the Wagner firm 's brief in the case included Rifkind , Crater , Professor Herman Oliphant of Columbia Law School , and Wagner himself . ) In 1933 , however , with the Depression at its nadir and breadlines everywhere , Rifkind found himself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic adaptability , he be  --  came an expert in bankruptcy reorga  --  nizations . Real-estate holdings in New York City were financed largely by mortgage certificates " guaranteed " by financial institutions , but now , with so many of the mortgaged properties in default , the guarantees meant little , and the courts had no systematic way of dealing with the situation . With the help of a group of fellow-lawyers , Rifkind invented one  --  to have a trustee appointed for each mortgage . Often , the trustee appointed was rep  --  resented by Rifkind , and thus it came about that at one time during the mid  --  dle nineteen-thirties he was in effect responsible for more parcels of city real estate than any other single tax  --  payer . Walking along lower Broad  --  way , he was always in sight of one of " his " buildings  --  Nos. 39 , 61 , 120 , 160 , and so on . Meanwhile , the fees for managing these reorganizations made Rifkind well-to-do . " In those days , on twenty-five thousand dollars a year one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , private schools for the children , a country place , " he says . A second son , Robert , was born in 1936 . Both sons eventually went to the old Lincoln School , on the West Side , and then to Loomis and Yale . When the boys were still small , Rifkind bought an old house with a dozen acres of woodland and farmland in Great Bar  --  rington , Massachusetts , as a place for his family to spend the summers . In 1939 , as the Depression ap  --  proached its end , the gentleman newly arrived in that status as a result of the Depression 's ravages ? had hardly realized that he would soon have to invent some thing else when Sena tor Wagner , on one of his comparatively rare visits to the law firm , walked into Rifkind 's office and said , " Si , how would you like to he a federal judge ? " Rifkind thought it was a joke . He knew well that Wagner 's idea of humor was to say to .1* almost any visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assis tant Secretary of the Navy ? " or " How would you like to be Third Under-Secre tary of State ? " How ever , he said to him self , " What harm would it do if I said yes ? " and he did so . Wagner looked sur prised , and proceeded to tell his law partner that he was making a big mistake . Nevertheless , he persuaded Roosevelt to make the appointment , and in June , 1941 , Rifkind was sworn in as a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York , at a salary of ten thousand dollars a year . The judicial life agreed with Rifkind immediately , and he resolved that he would wear its robes for the rest of his days . He soon won a reputa tion as a good judge . In 1947 , a col league on the bench , Jerome Frank , wrote in the Columbia Law Review , " Excepting Learned Hand , this coun try , I think , has no abler judge than .. Judge Rifkind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of the rigid legal perfectionism that many lawyers speak of as the hall mark of his career  --  he eventually won a reputation for kindness toward inex perienced advocates . " Your Honor , " wrote a young woman lawyer in Janu ary , 1950 , shortly after she had been admitted to the bar and had argued her first case , " perhaps this note is out of order , but I have been wanting so much to thank you for your indul gence when I appeared on behalf of the plaintiff .... In spite of your heavy schedule you certainly displayed infinite patience in assisting me in moments when I might have been com  --  pletely flustered by a less generous judge . " In the first few years of his service on the bench , Rifkind heard many cases arising out of the Second World War  --  involving draft dodgers , smug  --  glers of strategic materials , a woman accused of helping Nazi saboteurs land from a submarine off Long Island , and so on- In the early postwar years , his judicial diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charges of spying , and the like . All the while , along with weighing testimony and writing decisions , he was mulling over the proper conduct of a judge in and out of the courtroom to an extent that probably few judges do , and the writings and utterances that came out of these mullings may constitute his most unusual contribution to the American judicial system . In them , while waxing lyrical about the social role of the judge , he sets almost draco  --  nian rules for judicial performance and demeanor . " The man on the bench is the maker and master of his court  --  room , " he said in a speech to a judicial conference in Cincinnati in 1959 , long after he had left the bench himself . He went on to one of his more extrava  --  gant lyrical flights : The courtroom , sooner or later , becomes the image of the judge . It will rise or fall to the level of the judge who presides over it .... No one can doubt that to sit in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moving experiences of a lifetime . Upon his countenance is mirrored a uni  --  verse in motion . His face reveals a man who has laid many sacrifices upon the altar of his quest for knowledge . His speech discloses a cozy familiarity with the great literature of the world and with the art of the great masters . His eyes have beheld the missile-masted spires of great cathedrals in many climates and his heart has been moved to the tempo of great music . His demeanor is solemn but his eyes arc atwink/e . In the spectators he inspires not fear but reverence .... To observe him in action in his courtroom is an experi  --  ence comparable to seeing Pavlova dance or Sarah Bernhardt create a role upon the stage .... A gentle wave of the hand , like that of a great conductor , and a line of questioning is discontinued which it going nowhere or has already served its purpose . The rules that Rifkind lays down for judicial conduct outside the court  --  room are far more specific , and , by that token , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too prominent a host in his community is , somehow , a lesser judge , " he pronounced in 1964 , in a talk to a conference on judicial ethics at the University of Chicago 's Law School . " The same is true if he is a very conspicuous sport on the polo field , or a too frequent standee at the fifty-dollar window of the race track . Indeed , I believe that the public looks askance at the judge who eats too much , or drinks too much , or dresses in an excessively high style , or who plays too hard . " The following year , he issued to members of the American Bar Association a new set of com  --  mandments  --  not from Mount Sinai but , rather , from a platform at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach . Among these were : A judicial career and a scandalous life simply do not mix . A judge 's wife ought not to be among the first to be seen in a topless bathing suit . I think a judge ought not to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge who asserts his right to go to the front of the line at the theatre box office is not serving the judiciary well . It is surely to Rifkind 's credit that none of the Bar Association members present seem to have been able to point to instances in which Rifkind , during his own term on the bench , violated any of these rules . Nevertheless , by 1978 , when he was again heard from about judges at a judicial conference of the Second Circuit  --  his tone had changed sharply . This time , Rifkind concentrated on delineating various types of judges in terms of their per  --  sonal relations with the advocates who appear before them . He distinguished , for example , the " good scout , " who , presumably out of the kindness of his heart , is always helping an inept pros  --  ecutor frame his questions more effec  --  tively , with the result that " a dagger is plunged into your client 's case ; " the " lamb turned lion , " who suddenly be  --  gins loudly berating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it later develops , except " to show your client how hard you work , what a battle you are wag  --  ing for him ; " and " God 's gift to young associates , " who pours oppro  --  brium and scorn on a succession of lawyers , so that when the important case defended by the young associate 's law firm comes up the senior members of the firm will shun the court and give the young associate a rare chance by sending him in their place . It seems from that speech that almost thirty years of appearing before judges as Paul , Weiss 's chief litigator had al  --  tered Rifkind 's approach to the judi  --  ciary from stern prescriptiveness to mellow irony . MIDWAY through his career as a judge , Rifkind took a leave of absence to serve for six months as adviser on Jewish affairs to the Thea  --  tre Commander of United States forces in Europe . In early October , 1945 , he received a letter from Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson , who wrote , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in caring for Jewish survi  --  vors of Nazism and the urgency of their proper solution have prompted him to request the War Department to suggest an outstanding American Jewish civilian to act as his personal adviser on Jewish affairs in the U.S. Zones . . . I am glad to join with General Eisenhower in inviting you to accept this position . " Having cleared his leave with the chief judge of the circuit , Learned Hand , Rifkind quick  --  ly accepted , and chose to take along as his deputy Lawrence Eno , a young lawyer who had worked for him at the Wagner law firm and who was now serving in the Army , in the Judge Advocate General 's office , as a captain . Within two weeks , Rifkind , with Eno at his side , was on his way to Germany . After meeting Eisenhower at his headquarters in Frankfurt , and receiving . a letter signed by the General which in  --  structed all United States unit com  --  manders to accept Rifkind 's recom  --  mendations , he and Eno set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  placed-persons camps in the United States Zones of Germany and Austria . It was , of course , a soul-searing ex  --  perience for Rifkind , coming as he did directly from the generally cool and ordered world of an American federal courtroom . There were at the time about a hundred thousand Jews living in temporary quarters in these zones , and the number was increasing as new refugees from Eastern Europe moved in . Most of them had recently been freed from Nazi concentration camps and were physically and emotionally devastated ; hardly any were in family groups , such had been the vehemence of Nazi persecution and mass murder ; almost all implacably loathed Ger  --  many and Austria , and longed to be elsewhere . Early in his tour of duty , Rifkind , in a moment of despair , con  --  cluded that Hitler had won his war against the Jews . Later , he put his feelings in the Biblical cadences that he often adopts in moments of high emotion : " It seemed to me that I was surfeited with horror ; my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not endure any more . " Gradually , though , his mood changed . In the D.P. centers , he and Eno saw demo  --  cratic elections , the establishment of schools and workshops , the founding of newspapers and journals , the rise of lively political and intellectual debate . In communicating with the people he met , Rifkind 's fluency in Yiddish and knowledge of Jewish cultural tradition proved indispensable . He recalled re  --  cently , " I 'd stop someone and ask how he was doing . ' I 'm content with my lot , ' he would reply . ' Then you must be a very rich man , ' I 'd say . Recogniz  --  ing a traditional Jewish exchange , he 'd slap me on the hack , and we 'd be friends . " That spring , he wrote , " One day the realization dawned upon me that I had blundered . It was not true that Hitler had won the war against the Jews .... He did not win it , be  --  cause today in Germany and Austria there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  dure , who are determined to live as Jews , who are pre  --  pared to pioneer again and create again a Jewish civili  --  zation . " Thanks to the authority granted him by Eisenhower , Rifkind was able to improve the quality of food and equip  --  ment made available to the D.P. centers by the United States Army . ( In his final report to the Theatre Com  --  mander , in March , 1946 , Rifkind wrote that of the various agencies charged with responsibility for Jewish refugees the Army was the only one that up to then had made " a substan  --  tial and noteworthy contribution " ? a remark that annoyed officials of a num  --  ber of other organizations , especially Floral() H. LaGuardia , former mayor of New York City and , in 1946 , head of the United Nations Relief and Re  --  habilitation Administration . ) But the heart of the problem , of course , was not how to improve life in the temporary centers but how to provide a perma  --  nent home for the displaced Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that the only practical solution was the es  --  tablishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine . In December , 1945 , after Rifkind had repeatedly expressed this view to Eisenhower  --  and after he had taken a leading role in arranging the first meeting between Eisenhower and David Ben-Gurion , the future first prime minister of Israel and at that time the leading champion of a Jewish homeland  --  the General sent Rifkind on a fact-finding trip to Palestine . Rifkind satisfied himself that , contrary to the received wisdom of the time , there was enough room there for the displaced Jews of Europe , and he even succeeded in setting up a temporary air service between Frankfurt and Jerusa  --  lem , using American military equip  --  ment and personnel . Two years later , Rifkind was the chairman of a com  --  mittee of prominent American Jews including Jerome Frank , Stanley H. Fuld , Abraham Tulin , Milton Han  --  dler , Murray I. Gurfein , Abe Fortas , and Rifkind 's former aide Lawrence Eno  --  who put together a paper enti  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Problem , " which is widely con  --  sidered one of the key documents in the establishment of the State of Israel . In retrospect , Rifkind might per  --  haps be faulted for being carried away by his American patriotism to the point of accepting United States policy too uncritically . For example , he took it as given that United States immi  --  gration laws made it impossible for this country to play a major role in solving the problem of displaced Euro  --  pean Jews , and at the time he never suggested that those laws might be changed to meet the situation . But an uncritical American patriot , after all , is what he had been since his high-school days during the First World War and what he is today . He said , in his downright way , in a speech to the American Jewish Conference , in New York City , in the spring of 1946 , " I am proud of the military statesmen in charge of our affairs in Germany , who have thus far acted on the principle of human compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bright page in the history of our German occupa  --  tion . " TN April , 1946 , Rifkind returned to 1 his judgeship in New York . In May , 1950 , he resigned it . He wrote to President Truman in his letter of resignation , " Experience has con  --  vinced me that it is impossible for a judge who has family responsibilities to maintain a reasonable standard of living with the salary now established by law . " ( The annual salary of a fed  --  eral judge at the time was fifteen thou  --  sand dollars ; judges in the higher courts in New York City , meanwhile , were being paid twenty-eight thou  --  sand dollars . ) His resignation brought an outpouring of letters of regret from his colleagues on the bench ; at the same time , he has since said , it brought a measure of derision on the score of his announced reason . However , Rif-kind 's current partner and fellow-liti  --  gator Edward N. Costikyan feels that his motive in leaving the bench was not solely the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes behold regularly the missile-masted spires of great cathe  --  drals . Costikyan believes that Rifkind on the bench , constantly attending with the ear of an analytical perfectionist to the often inept arguments of litigators , finally " had enough of lis  --  tening to other people do it badly " and found he was itching to be in the liti  --  gator 's role himself . In any case , shortly after Rifkind announced his intention of resigning he was approached by an acquaintance of his , Louis Weiss , then a senior partner of Paul , Weiss , Wharton &; Garrison , with an offer to join the firm . At about the same time , he got another proposal concerning his fu  --  ture , the degree of seriousness of which he is still not sure about . In the course of casual conversation between Rifkind and his old law-school friend William 0 . Douglas , by 1950 a Jus  --  tice of the United States Supreme Court , Douglas said , " Suppose I left the bench  --  would you join a law part  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were to leave the bench , it would be a great disservice to the country , but if you did it , yes , I would join a law partnership with you . You have sixty days to tell me your decision . " Douglas made no response to that . Nor did Rifkind hear from Douglas over the next sixty days , and after the period had elapsed he accepted the Paul , Weiss offer . He told Weiss that he did n't care whether or not his name was included in the firm 's name , and that , if it was included , he did n't care where it went in the order of names . After deliberating on the matter , the partners decided to include Rifkind 's name right in the middle , and thus , on May 24 , 1950 , Paul , Weiss , Whar  --  ton &; Garrison became Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton &; Garrison . ( On hearing the news , Douglas telephoned Rifkind and said mildly , " Hey , I thought you were going to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm was small , distinguished , and not particularly old . Although it had roots going back to 1875 , the modern firm of Paul , Weiss dated from 1923 , when Weiss  --  a man of broad cultural interests , who later served as chairman of the board of trustees of the New School for Social Research  --  formed a law partnership with John F. Wharton , a specialist in theatrical law , who later pioneered in the use of the limited partnership as a means of financing Broadway shows , and who in 1951 brought out a more or less autobiographical novel called " The Explorations of George Bur  --  ton . " In 1927 , Weiss &; Wharton joined with another firm and became known as Cohen , Cole , Weiss &; Wharton . In 1946 , it was joined by Randolph Paul , a prolific and widely respected writer on taxes , who had previously served as general counsel to the Treasury Department , and by Lloyd Garrison  --  a descendant of the celebrated pre-Civil ' War abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison  --  who had previously practiced law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wisconsin Law School and first chair  --  man of the National Labor Relations Board , and earned a reputation as a supporter of liberal causes . For all the distinction of its mem  --  bers , Paul , ' Weiss in 1950 was a rather modest operation . Its one litigating partner Samuel J. Silverman , now a judge of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court  --  de  --  voted himself chiefly to providing a service to clients of other Paul , Weiss departments . Rifkind , given a free hand to conduct any sort of practice he chose , set about building up a litiga  --  tion practice . The going was slow at first , but in the middle fifties the en  --  terprise began to take off . Through no particular intention on his part , Rifkind found himself frequently rep  --  resenting prominent persons in well-publicized cases . Among his beau-monde clients at various times were not only Jacqueline Onassis but the restaurateur Toots Shot- and Clau  --  dius Charles Philippe , onetime vice-president of the Waldorf-Astoria . Rifkind readily affirms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such people , though he says he feels that the legal issues in them tended to be less interesting than those raised in unglamorous but more com  --  plex cases . Nevertheless , in several of the celebrity cases he managed to get in some litigatory licks that are re  --  membered with admira  --  tion by his partners . His first case involving Mrs. Onassis ( then Mrs. Kennedy ) ? her suit , initiated in 1966 , to block publi  --  cation of " The Death of a President , " by William Manchester , which ended in a compromise when Manchester made certain textual changes she had demanded  --  is now recalled by Rifkind as having been , from a legal per  --  spective , something of an " open-and-shut matter . " ( Needless to say , Man  --  chester and his publishers thought otherwise . ) Much more interesting to Rifkind was her court battle in 1971-72 to restrain the photographer Ron Galella from harassing her by constantly dogging her footsteps with camera in hand . " The problem wasthat Galella could argue that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think we proved the thing had gone beyond the limits of sufferahility . " An injunction was issued against certain acts by Galella , and in the process the limita  --  tions on the rights of photographers of public figures were for the first time defined . ( That Mrs. Onassis was a satisfied client at the time seems to be indicated by a pencilled message that she dropped by his law office on Valen  --  tine 's Day midway through the con  --  test , and that he still treasures ; it con  --  sists of a heart containing the words " Guess who ? , " underneath which , eliminating the guesswork , is the sig  --  nature " Jackie . " However , Aristotle Onassis later balked at paying the Paul , Weiss fee , and the matter was not settled until the firm resorted to the unusual measure of bringing suit for it . ) A Rifkind performance often men tioned with awe by his admirers is his defense , in 1962 and 1963 , of J. Tru man Bidwell , former chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eva sion . The issue turned on expense de ductions that had been taken by Bid well but were apparently not supported by his records . ( " Hardly an unusual case , " Rifkind comments dryly . ) The first trial ended in a hung jury , and the case was re-tried . In the second trial , Rifkind scored a legal coup of the sort that litigators dream of . In cross examination of the Internal Revenue Service agent who had audited Bid well 's returns , Rifkind questioned him about his doodles on the notepaper on which he had recorded his findings . On the basis of the doodles , Rif kind got the agent to admit that he had first decided that Bidwell 's deductions were legitimate and had only later changed his mind . Thus , the sugges tion was planted that the agent had been influenced by bloodthirsty supe riors at the I.R.S. The jury acquitted the defendant . " Si 's summation to the jury was a masterly tour de force , " says Jay Topkis , who has long been closely associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know what he did : He urged the jury not to give in to the temptation of a small boy to throw a snowball at the man wearing a silk hat . And do you know what he did then ? He asked the jury to think of Bidwell as a small , defenseless bird that they were in a position to crush in their hand . He has an incredible gift for the apt analogy . " High on the list of complicated cor  --  porate cases that Rifkind likes to recall is his defense , in 1968 and 1969 , of B. D. ( Tex ) Leuty , the retired president of the Colonial Pipeline Company , which had been formed by a consor  --  tium of major oil companies to estab  --  lish a pipeline from Houston to the Northeast . The government brought suit against Colonial , Leuty , and sev  --  eral other companies and individuals , including the former mayor and the former council president of Wood  --  bridge Township , New Jersey , charg  --  ing that Colonial Pipeline 's officials had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sion for the company to build storage tanks in the township and to run the pipeline through it . In the ensuing jury trial , held in the United States District Court in Newark , Rifkind did not deny that the payments had been made . Rather , he charged that Wood  --  bridge Township 's officials had de  --  manded them , in a situation where not to pay them would have been prohibi  --  tively expensive for Colonial , and that therefore the actual crime had been not conspiracy to bribe but extortion by the municipality . Judge Rey vier J. Wortendyke , Jr. , had instructed the jury  --  incorrectly , Rifkind believes  --  that extortion is not a defense against conspiracy to bribe , and the jury found Leuty guilty . However , so persuasive had Rifkind been that Judge Wor  --  tendyke let Leuty off with a fine of twenty thousand dollars and a sus  --  pended sentence of five years on proba  --  tion " without supervision . " Such a sentence was , for practical purposes , no sentence at all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was merely complying with the letter of the law and was persuaded that Leuty was morally blameless . To Rifkind 's delight , the Judge went further , stating as he de  --  livered the sentence that he considered Leuty to be a fine , upstanding busi  --  nessman , whom he found it a pleasure to know . ( The defendants appealed the verdict , and in the Court of Ap  --  peals got a reversal on a legal techni  --  cality , so Leuty never had to pay his fine or serve his metaphysical sen  --  tence . ) It was the paradox  --  that a judge , in the interests of fairness and justice , should end up not only in ef  --  fect releasing a convicted hrihery con  --  spirator but praising him in the pro  --  cess  --  that appealed to Rifkind , who is a lover of paradox , especially when it serves his side of a case . EARLY in 1957 , Rifkind suffered a serious heart attack . He was then staying at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco and was engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behest of the Supreme Court as Special Master in the case involving rights to the waters of the Colorado River . The issue had been in controversy since the building of the Hoover Dam , on the Colorado be  --  tween Nevada and Arizona , in the nineteen-thirties . Rifkind has since identified the case  --  which involved new law , new science , millions of peo  --  ple , billions of dollars , and such high feeling that at one stage Arizona actu  --  ally called out its troops  --  as the " peak of satisfaction " of his whole career . At the time of his heart attack , Rifkind had for two years been journeying to San Francisco at intervals for hearings on the case , and three more years were to pass before he issued his report , in four hundred and thirty-three pages , making a finding essentially in favor of Arizona . The finding was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1963 , with the sole dissenting vote coming from , of all people , his old friend Justice Douglas . ( Much more recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five Indian reservations situated in the Colorado River basin , was re  --  opened before a new Special Master , and this March the Supreme Court delivered a new opinion largely reaf  --  firming Rifkind 's findings . ) The prog  --  ress of the case was , of course , de  --  layed by Rifkind 's illness . So , appar  --  ently , was the progress of Paul , Weiss . " How we miss you ! " Rifkind 's partner Garrison wrote him in March , 1957 , during his illness . " The firm has an anemic and ghostlike quality without you . However busy you are when you are here , the mere knowledge that you are present , and can he got at in a pinch , gives everyone confidence and bounce . Now we are mere flesh with  --  out a backbone . " After several months in a hospital and a period of restricted activity , Rifkind made a complete recovery , and since then has enjoyed a quarter cen  --  tury of good health . Almost the only change in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his habit of riding horseback in Central Park on Saturday mornings . During his absence , though , his Paul , Weiss partners had had practical as well as emotional reasons to miss him . Beginning with the death of Louis Weiss , a few months after Rifkind 's arrival at the firm , Rifkind had become more and more involved in the firm 's ad  --  ministration , and by 1957 ? although Paul , Weiss did not , and still does not , formally have a " managing partner " ? he was the guiding spirit of the office . Comparatively early in his part  --  nership , Rifkind drafted a Statement of Principles for the firm , incorporat  --  ing such declarations as " We believe in maintaining , by affirmative efforts , a membership of partners and associ  --  ates reflecting a wide variety of reli  --  gious , political , ethnic , and social backgrounds , characteristic of the New York City community . " This gave formal recognition to a principle ? generally speaking , far ahead of its time in New York law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm 's establishment by one lawyer of Jewish background ( Weiss ) and one of Protestant background ( Wharton ) . Concurrently , he was tak  --  ing the lead in formalizing Paul , Weiss 's organizational structure , which is based on an intricate array of committees and meetings that before his time had operated largely on an informal basis . The two most impor  --  tant committees are the Committee on Committees , which appoints the mem  --  bers of the other committees and gen  --  erally serves as the firm 's administra  --  tive body , and one called , with elegant forthrightness , the Deciding Group , which has the delicate function of de  --  ciding each partner 's share in the firm 's yearly profits . Rifkind says , " I believe strongly in institu  --  tional forms of group be  --  havior . I 'm very positive that they contribute to cre  --  ativity . My idea was ' Let 's institutionalize our informal meetings . ' I established the principle that every partner must engage to some extent in administration and serve on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day when you know you 've got to stand up on your two feet and address a meet  --  ing  --  well , like the prospect of being hanged , it concentrates the mind won  --  derfully . Of course , I was n't alone in any of those ideas . " Above all , Rifkind is given credit for what is perhaps most anomalous about Paul , Weiss 's structure  --  the fact that major deci  --  sions are arrived at on a one-partner , one-vote basis , whether the partner is a newly admitted young ex-associate or a former Supreme Court Justice or Presidential candidate . Some powerful and well-known partners have found themselves unable to live with this rule and have left the firm as a result . Surely the most spectacular of Rifkind 's firm-building activities was his role in the recruitment , from time to time , of new partners who had made names for themselves in politics and government . The first of these was Adlai Stevenson , who became a Paul , Weiss partner in May , 1957 ? a few months after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Eisenhower , incidentally , had once had a rather startling conver sation with Rifkind about Presiden tial ambitions . At a meeting between the two men during Rifkind 's term in Europe as Jewish-affairs adviser , the Theatre Commander had asked Rifkind whether he thought that by reason of his wartime experience he , Eisenhower , could " improve himself " in the postwar period . Rifkind had laughed out loud at the language Ei senhower used , and replied , " Do n't you realize that all you have to do is not say no and you will be President of the United States ? " ) Rifkind met Ste venson , through Lloyd Garrison , late in 1956 , and found him , he says , " in terested in our way of practicing law . " The matter was discussed  --  as the ad mission of a new partner always is hy all the Paul , Weiss partners , and , though there were a few doubts ex pressed , based on fears that Stevenson might not be serious enough about practicing law , he was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , because Stevenson 's Chi cago law office became a Paul , Weiss branch , and thus his three Chicago law partners  --  William McCor mick Blair , Jr. , Newton Minow , and W. Willard Wirtz  --  all became Paul , Weiss partners . ( The mass recruitment was followed by a mass defection in early 1961 , when the Kennedy Administration claimed the whole Stevenson contingent ? Blair to be Ambassador to Denmark , Minow to be chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , Wirtz to he Under-Secretary of Labor , and Stevenson to be Ambassador to the United Nations . ) Paul , ' Weiss 's next recruitment of a major political figure ? that , in 1966 , of Theodore Soren sen , former special counsel and speech writer to President Kennedy  --  was not Rifkind 's particular doing , although he heartily concurred in it ; but when Arthur Goldberg , former Secretary of Labor , former Supreme Court Justice , and Ambassador to the United Na  --  tions , /eft the latter job , in 1968 , Rifkind was exclusively responsible for persuading him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Weiss partners who are more or less well known for their previous political and government connections include Ram  --  sey Clark , United States Attorney General in the Johnson Administra  --  tion ; Jerome Kurtz , Commissioner of Internal Revenue in the Carter Ad  --  ministration ; Matthew Nimetz , an Under-Secretary of State in the Carter Administration ; and Edward N. Cos  --  tikyan , former New York County Democratic Leader . ( At the height of the firm 's politicality , two Paul , Weiss partners  --  Sorensen and Adrian Dc  --  Wind  --  found themselves running against each other for a post as dele  --  gate to the 1968 Democratic Conven  --  tion . ) Many of the original Paul , ' Weiss celebrities are no longer with the firm . Stevenson remained in the U.N . job until his death , in 1965 ; Blair , Mi  --  now , and Wirtz did not return after their government service ; and Gold  --  berg and Clark resigned , in 1971 and 1973 respectively . Sorensen almost left in 1977 to become director of the Central Intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said at the time , " I am unable , even in fantasy , to visualize Ted Sorensen hidden in a cloak and concealing a dagger in his sock " ) , but he ended up withdrawing his name from consideration and not only re  --  mains at Paul , Weiss but is a key figure in its fast-expanding interna  --  tional practice . Commenting on his recruitment of celebrities as partners , Rifkind says , " Well , they were all good lawyers . Besides , I did think the fact that they were people of renown would add to our firm 's lustre and cachet  --  yes , I did . " THE nineteen-sixties in America were a time to try Rifkind 's soul , and the defense of Genera/ Motors against the charges of Ralph Nader was a case to try his reputation . Right from the start , it was clear that Gen  --  eral Motors was up against a great national wave of anti-corporation , pro-consumer sentiment . " General Motors was n't a regular Paul , Weiss client , although we had represented the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they came to me on this one , I decided , with my part  --  ners ' concurrence , to take it . Nader had written a very derogatory book about General Motors products , the Corvair in particular . They had de  --  cided that they wanted to know what manner of man Nader was , and had conducted an investigation of him , which lie claimed had invaded his pri  --  vacy . In the course of preparing the case , I think we reached the point where we knew that Nader could n't prove the specific points of invasion that were legally actionable  --  he could prove some that were n't actionable , but not those that were . It was an iffy question for both sides . We soon came to realize that we were tangling with a man who had a patent ability to attract public attention . As you 'll recall , Sen  --  ate hearings had been held on the matter . Our job was to deflect public criticism of General Motors , and I think I did it , with great help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the case may have represented for Paul , Weiss an in  --  stance of the age-old division of opin  --  ion among lawyers as to whether their duty consists of representing only those clients whose cases they fully believe in or of seeing that everyone , right or wrong , gets not only his day in court but the best available argument  --  mentation during that day . Rifkind , like a majority of litigators , leans to the latter view . About the Nader-General Motors case , Rifkind says , " I had no qualms . I represent my client . I have sometimes turned down people who wanted me to represent them . For example , as a business decision rather than a moral principle , I wo n't repre  --  sent underworld characters , but I find no fault with a lawyer who does . I once told a group of lawyers that I 'd represent Lucifer if he brought an eviction ? complaint about his expulsion from eaven  --  unless , of course , I 'd already been retained by the Archan  --  gel Michael . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , the New York City lawyer and writer Charles Rembar , in his book " Per  --  spective . " Concerning James St. Clair 's advocacy of President Nixon in the impeachment inquiry of 1974 , Rembar writes , " The case .. has to do with Nixon 's continuing in of  --  fice . And if I think his continuing in office is bad for the country , then I think I 'm doing a rotten thing to help him continue in office . . . . The lawyer is not a public utility . He does not have to take cases except in one situation , and that is when nobody else will take the case . " Paul , Weiss partners , however , are proud of having taken the cases of many unpopular  --  perhaps deservedly unpopular  --  clients who might easily have found somebody else , among them Vice-President Spiro Agnew , in the case that led to his resignation , and Robert Vesco , the ac  --  cused looter of mutual funds , who has escaped prosecution only by staying outside the jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States courts . Despite Rifkind 's statement that he would have taken Nailer 's case if he had been asked and if Nader could have paid his fee , it is doubtful whether Rifkind would have been completely happy representing Nader . Jay Topkis recalls , " Si 's position on Nader was probably influenced by a personal emotional factor . What he could n't stand about Nader was that Nader would n't have his own tele  --  phone  --  he insisted on using a pay phone out in the hall . Si thought Na  --  der was playing the penniless , barefoot saint , and Si does n't suffer saints gladly . " Beyond that , Nader was , after all , part of the youth revolt of the sixties , and Rifkind , with his physi  --  cally and morally stringent beginnings and his traditional and temperamental worship of hard work , did not suffer the youth revolt gladly , either . Indeed , it gave Rifkind a fine chance to be Rif-kind : he was against it , and no bones made ? an attitude that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his part  --  ners , and occasionally to their embarrassment . His greatest scorn was reserved not for the hippies and thought  --  less young radicals themselves but for the encouragers and cod  --  dlers among their el  --  ders . In a speech delivered in Novem  --  ber , 1969 , to the Lawyers ' Division of the American Jewish Committee , he put these sentiments into what might be called Rifkindese . Deploring the fact that " we see every form of devia  --  tionism not only looked upon with tolerance but extolled as virtuous , " he proclaimed roundly that " our ances  --  tors already learned from the expe  --  rience of the race that such behavior causes the earth to vomit up those who practice it . " In not a single instance , he went on , had he encountered " earnest , intelligent , well-informed , thought  --  ful " young people among " the exhihi MAY 23 , 1983 tionists , the transvestites , the impu  --  dent loudmouths , the irresponsibles , the stone throwers , and the window smashers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest belief that the world has undergone a period of foolishness like the days of the Children 's Crusade in the thirteenth century . Now it is time to stop the nonsense ? ' The chief nonsense inside the Paul , Weiss offices that Rifkind thought ought to he stopped consisted of the wearing of long hair and beards by men . Around 1970 , to a shocked and dismayed meeting of partners and as  --  sociates , some of them with long hair and beards , he delivered a tirade against those styles , at least when worn without fastidious tending . After the meeting , some associates began ex  --  pressing doubts about their compatibil  --  ity with the environment they found themselves in at Paul , Weiss . Rif-kind 's partners had to calm them down by saying , " Oh , do n't mind Si . " At about the same time , according to a famous Paul , Weiss story , Rifkind walked into the office of a young fe  --  male associate of the firm and found on a wall there a large poster with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own office , the story goes on , Rifkind grabbed his telephone , called one of his partners , described the epi  --  sode , and said , " Either she goes or I go . " The partner talked him out of his ultimatum , and Rif-kind said nothing more on the subject . " At bottom , Si is a sensible man , " another partner comments . It may well be that Rifkind 's rage against the rebellious youth of the sixties contributed to the enthusiasm with ma Anal which he took up the cudgels against Nader . It can hardly be said that he won the case , since the parties to it agreed in 1970 to an out-of-court settlement in which General Motors made a pay  --  ment of four hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars to Nader , and this money  --  the first substantial sum that the Nader organization had laid its hands on  --  launched that organization into the nineteen-seventies as the lead  --  ing consumer-advocacy group in the country . On the other hand , General Motors had been prepared to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum Nader agreed to , so Rif-kind had a satisfied client . THE NEW YORKER . The many liberals who worshipped Rifkind as the author of Section 7(a) and as one of the undertakers of the yellow-dog contract may have experi  --  enced a measure of disillusion as their former hero devoted himself so long and so assiduously to protecting a gi  --  ant corporation against a lone critic on whom it had set spies . Rifkind 's liberal reputation was somewhat retrieved , however , by his representation , in 1970 , of Justice Douglas in the con  --  gressional initiative to impeach him . That campaign , led by then Repre  --  sentative Gerald Ford , was based on a constellation of charges , among them that Douglas had received payments for serving on the hoard of a private foundation and that he had published an article in an allegedly obscene mag  --  azine . A subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary , which considered the charges , quickly put aside the constitutional ground of " high crimes and misdemeanors " as inapplicable , and concentrated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fulfilling the re  --  quirement , also constitutional , that judges may serve only " during good behavior . " " The case took a lot of investigation , " Rif kind says . " Doug  --  las threw open all his files , and he was a great keeper of papers . In addition , we studied every impeachment case that had ever come before Congress . We were able to establish that the implication of Douglas 's impeachment would be that Congress could remove any federal judge at its pleasure , and ultimately the subcommittee decided that there was no basis for impeach  --  ment . " The fact is that by the nineteen-seventies Rifkind was neither a liberal nor a conservative , although he had in him elements of each . He had become , in every cell and fibre , an advocate ; for better or worse , the lawyer 's ethic of giving a client his best effort had largely overmastered the statesman 's ethic of seeking social justice for its own sake . Indeed , Rifkind recently as  --  serted his belief that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover the truth is " a myth . " Rather , he said , " The true function of a litigation is to resolve a dispute , and to resolve it by the principled applica  --  tion of universal rules . Naturally , the more civilized the society , the more sophisticated and the more humane are the rules . " Truth , it must follow , is secondary in litigation to effective per  --  suasion of a judge or jury , or both ; if truth is not the objective of a trial , surely it need not be the primary con  --  cern of an advocate . Against the ar  --  gument that some people can afford more effective persuasion than others , Rifkind upholds the need for good lawyers to engage in pro-bono , or no-fee , activities on behalf of clients who can not pay . He insists , however , that a lawyer is under no moral obligation to engage in pro-bono activities ; rather , to do so is his privilege , and the ad  --  vantage , or part of it , is self-fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Paul , Weiss practices what Rif kind preaches , he had his staff calculate how many hours the firm 's partners and associates had devoted to pro-bono activities during a recent fourteen-month period . The figure came to just short of twenty-five thou  --  sand hours  --  the equivalent of several million dollars . ) The question that re  --  mains is whether Rifkind 's cool , prag  --  matic , optimistic view of legal ethics ? that intelligent self-interest on the part of lawyers ultimately serves the common good  --  applies in the real world of law any better than Adam Smith 's somewhat analogous " invisi  --  ble hand " theory has proved to apply in the real world of economics . eighty-one , Rifkind handles fewer clients than he used to , and he refuses to take on cases in which the trials are expected to be long ones , but he still has the principal responsibility for numerous leading Paul , Weiss clients , among them La  --  zard Freres &; Company , Revlon , and the Municipal Assistance Corporation . He sold his Great Barrington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age when they were no longer interested in spending summers there ; summer vacations for him and Mrs. Rifkind now usually consist of a couple of weeks at an inn on Martha 's Vineyard . The sons are both outstand  --  ingly successful men . Richard , now fifty-two , was formerly the head of cancer research at Columbia 's College of Physicians and Surgeons and is now chairman of the Sloan-Kettering In  --  stitute for Cancer Research and direc  --  tor of graduate studies at the Memo  --  rial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , and Robert , now forty-six , is a partner in the law firm of Cravath , Swaine &; Moore . Both are married and have children of their own . Rifkind arrives at the Paul , Weiss offices , at 345 Park Avenue , before eight o'clock , walking the twenty-five blocks from his apartment , at 936 Fifth Avenue , on good days , and driving himself in his Cadillac on bad ones . For lunch , on the comparatively few days when he is n't involved in a Paul , Weiss meeting , he favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , occasionally , the Harmonic Club . At whatever pub  --  lic places he frequents , he is known to the staff as Judge . ( For that mat  --  ter , in court he is sometimes called Judge by judges , although some law  --  yers frown on this manner of address by a sitting judge to an advocate , 011 the ground that it may be prejudicial in his client 's favor . ) He is said by his partners to worry a lot about their well-being and that of all Paul , Weiss employees  --  their illnesses , their mari  --  tal and emotional problems , their colds . When he thinks of his child  --  hood in Meretz , it seems like a dream old enough to be a myth . Given though he is to moral apo  --  thegms framed in Biblical language , and devoted though he is to the Jewish community , Rifkind is by temperament secular rather than religious . The law is his religion , and , characteristical  --  ly , when he seeks to express his feel  --  ings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brashly adapts its text . In the Eighty-fourth Psalm appears the famous verse " For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness . " Rifkind likes to give what he calls a " prayerful recitation " of that verse , with a single phrase amended : " For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of the law , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness . " ? JOHN BROOKS
