Persecuted by the shogun , they still worship a " closetgod " <P> On the picturesque Japanese island of Ikitsuki , where the ways of farmers and fishermen die hard , two old men squat before a home altar and chant prayers carefully entrusted to them by their ancestors . The ritual is intense and moving . But something is askew . The rite is partly Buddhist , partly Christian . The language sounds odd , a sort of pidgin Latin . And what do the ancient prayers mean ? One of the worshipers admits , " I do n't understand a word of this . " <P> Neither does anyone else . The men at prayer are among 10,000 surviving Kakure Kirishitan ( crypto-Christians ) members of a fossilized faith that is unique in church annals . The poignant tale of the sect begins in 1549 , when Jesuit Missionary Francis Xavier brought Roman Catholicism to Japan . The new creed soon gathered 300,000 followers , including most of the inhabitants of Ikitsuki , but its success also spelled its doom . Fearing the Christians ' growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shogun mounted terror campaigns in which tens of thousands perished , often gruesomely . Christianity was all but stamped out . <P> But the Christians on Ikitsuki and neighboring islands , who were among the first to suffer , early on developed a way to preserve elements of their faith . Adopting a complex sham , they worshiped publicly at Buddhist temples , then slipped away at night to hold secret Christian prayer meetings . At home , they prayed overtly before Buddhist and Shinto altars , but their real altar became the nan do garni ( closet god ) , innocuous-looking bundles of cloth in which revered Christian statues and medallions were hidden . For 2 centuries , their fierce faith endured , but it inevitably also turned inward . Because their prayers and rituals had to be transmitted secretly among illiterate peasants , they slowly became garbled . Over the years the words were repeated while the meaning was forgotten , though some prayers retained a discernible Latin antecedent : " Ame Maria karassa binno domisu terikobintsu . . . " obviously derives from " Ave Maria gratia plena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Japan permitted a Catholic church to open in Nagasaki to serve Western visitors , the Kakure , then numbering around 30,000 in the region , suddenly came out of hiding . But the missionaries took a hard line with the newfound faithful . " Many were bewildered when they were told to throw away everything connected with their ancestral way , " explains Father Shigeshi Oyama , who runs the tiny Roman Catholic parish now on Ikitsuki . Only half of the underground Christians decided to reunite with Rome . The others persisted in their insular worship . <P> Today on Ikitsuki , the center of the Kakure population , there are 80 house churches with their closet god . At such public ceremonies as Kakure funerals , a Buddhist priest is always asked to officiate , but , says one of them , " these people make sure to give a prayer in secret to erase the effect of ours . " The sect 's leader , the Ojisama ( Revered Uncle ) , conducts a baptism-like ceremony with water drawn from a site of 17th century martyrdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
