The predicament may sound familiar , but Rick and Lonnie are hardly stock figures from a TV sitcom or sentimental drama in which love conquers all .

In October , viewers proved again that they will watch sober-minded dramas dealing with unpleasant family matters : NBC 's The Burning Bed , starring Farrah Fawcett as a battered wife , drew the fourth highest ratings of any TV movie in history . <P> Social-issue movies have always been good for a network 's prestige ; now they seem to be good for its profit-and-loss sheet as well .

Moreover , in the face of growing competition from cable , social-issue dramas take on a new programming significance .
