In fact , those innocent words ' ' family film ' ' have lost a lot of their meaning . With relentless monotony , even today ' s milder movies usually have some element  --  a few vulgar words , maybe , or a burst of violence - to nudge them into the PG category . And many producers prefer things this way , fearing that a G rating might brand a picture as bland or childish. // Of course , the G rating doesn ' t have to mean any such thing . Films like ' ' 2001 : A Space Odyssey ' ' and ' ' My Brilliant Career ' ' have appealed to countless adults without sacrificing family suitability . But we have come a long way from the days when a Hollywood ' ' production code ' ' assured that most movies could be viewed without a qualm by ticket buyers of all ages. // The G rating has become the exception , and PG can mean anything from a single muttered vulgarity to a near-orgy teetering on the R-rated brink . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' label had better make it clear just what that signifies. // Hollywood ' s suspicion of the G tag is illustrated by recent events at Walt Disney Productions , where an effort has been under way to draw older and more sophisticated viewers  --  teenagers and adults who won ' t sit still for rehashes of ' ' Dumbo ' ' and ' ' The Absent-Minded Professor . ' ' Early moves in this direction , such as ' ' The Black Hole ' ' and ' ' Night Crossing , ' ' have not been promising. // But a new ' ' creative team ' ' has now taken control at Disney , and fresh ideas have started to flow . One result is a ' ' hard PG ' ' picture called ' ' Tex , ' ' due for release in early August . Based on a novel by S. E. Hinton , it takes a realistic look at a teenager with family troubles . The story touches on drugs and tentatively on sex . There is some violence , and at times the language is mildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ' s all in a good cause - presenting an accurate portrayal of a believable character , whose very flaws and weaknesses enhance the triumph of compassion , decency , and maturity which caps the movie . The treatment is a turnaround for the Disney organization , all right . But the new team is to be congratulated for giving director Tim Hunter the opportunity to tackle adolescence head on , confronting real problems with real solutions , not evading hard issues or wishing them away with moralistic formulas. // ' ' Tex ' ' may turn out to be a controversial item , but it certainly doesn ' t condescend to its intended audience of teens and older viewers . It ' s quite possibly the best Disney picture ever made , excluding cartoons , and certainly the most mature in the best sense of the word . <> <> Humorous film from Scotland // On the current scene another film likely to attract teenagers and young adults is Gregory ' s Girl , made in Scotland by director Bill Forsyth . There are a few libidinous moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight coming in second . But the characters are basically innocent , despite their occasional lapses of taste , and the film celebrates their youthful high spirits with no ulterior motive. // The hero is a gangly young man named Gregory , whose good nature is both a curse and a blessing . He ' s the nicest guy in town , but the girl of his dreams  --  the star of the school soccer team  --  lacks the patience for his easy charm and lackadaisical habits . Fortunately there ' s a conspiracy afoot to snag Gregory for another classmate , a doe-eyed lass who describes him as ' ' slow and awkward , ' ' as if those were the most endearing qualities under the sun . The ending is inconclusive , just like every other part of the picture . But we know things will work out fine. // It ' s a slight movie , full of loose ends and casual connections . But it ' s fun to watch , and has some very good laughs . Significantly , though it arrived just recently in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention - perhaps indicating a real hunger for fare that elevates romance over rowdiness and raunchiness . <> <> Spielberg films // Another youth-targeted movie , and likely to be one of the biggest hits of the year , is E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial by Steven Spielberg . Here there ' s less excuse for the lapses from G-rated taste . The vulgarities of the screenplay are good for nothing but a few cheap laughs , and are sure to offend some viewers who would otherwise applaud this merry movie . Even if they were absent , though , the PG tag might be merited by the film ' s sci-fi medical sequence , which casts a technological chill before giving way to a ' ' Peter Pan ' ' - style happy ending. // Such dubious flourishes aside , however , children are the natural audience for ' ' E. T. , ' ' which establishes Spielberg as the most amiably childlike director on the current scene . More than any other moviemaker , he understands what makes kids tick , and uses his savvy in scene after scene. // For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-teens howl with glee when the friendly spaceman hides from an earthbound mother by masquerading as a stuffed animal . The glee comes partly from the harmless ruse and partly from the audience ' s delighted recognition of a mom  --  just like a real one !  --  who ' s too preoccupied with grownup affairs to keep track of her children ' s toys . As the story unfolds , her obliviousness to the existence of E. T. becomes one of the movie ' s funniest themes . But typically for a Spielberg film , the ribbing is always good-natured , and stops before it has time to become grating or snide. // Spielberg knows how to kid the kids , too . Witness the priceless moment when a boy tries to con his little sister with a fib about the alien  --  claiming that ' ' only little children can see him ' '  --  and her reply is a sweetly drawled ' ' Gim me a break . ' ' Or an episode when the alien needs help making a quick escape to his spaceship . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks a neighborhood boy . To which the hero responds , ' ' No , this is reality ! ' ' // True , the movie works variations on old Hollywood formulas , such as making the young hero a stronger character than his older brother . But almost every aspect of the movie ( apart from its climax , which is overdone ) reflects a canny understanding of children as both characters and spectators . If you love kids , you won ' t see a more moving scene all year than young Elliott gently showing the spaceman his bedroom , explaining what a soft drink is , and giving the names of all his toys . Add to this the movie ' s lack of violence and its witty visual puns , and you have a summer entertainment that should please nearly everyone. // For the young-adult groupSpielberg ' s other hit of the season , Poltergeist , clearly goes for an older crowd than ' ' E. T. ' ' does , aiming many of its effects at the teen and young-adult crowd that turned his ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s biggest hit . After a slow and deliberate buildup , ' ' Poltergeist ' ' erupts in supernatural mayhem at a haunted housing tract that closely recalls the frantic finale of ' ' Raiders , ' ' though with a less-exotic background . ' ' Night of the Living Real Estate , ' ' you might call it. // As it happens , Spielberg is credited as producer of ' ' Poltergeist , ' ' with the directing credit going to Tobe Hooper , a technically talented filmmaker whose best-known work is the notorious ' ' Texas Chain Saw Massacre . Yet the energetic Spielberg appears to have provided the basic vision of the film : By his own account , he served as a ' ' strong , David O. Selznick-type ' ' producer , and was active on the set every day . And sure enough , there ' s a sense of family warmth and security running through ' ' Poltergeist ' ' that takes a lot of the edge off the explosive scenes . It ' s also interesting to note that not a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plot , despite a lot of harrowingly close calls . That ' s the Spielberg touch at work. // Thus , while ' ' Poltergeist ' ' wanders far from ' ' family film ' ' territory , it ' s still more restrained than most adventure-fantasies of recent years and more rooted in everyday reality  --  so much that it ' s hard to swallow at times , as when the ultimate symbol of American safety and sanity turns out to be a Holiday Inn ! // Watching goodness and normality triumph over the forces of darkness and disarray , it ' s natural to recall that Spielberg had his origins as a filmmaker when he was still at a fairy-tale age . He made his first movie as a child growing up in Arizona . At that time he was in love with his Lionel electric-train set , and used it to stage enormous train wrecks . When his exasperated parents warned that they wouldn ' t repair any more locomotives or replace any more boxcars , young Steven borrowed his father ' s eight-mm camera and filmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The result almost overwhelmed him . ' ' I didn ' t loom over the train , ' ' he says now , remembering his first viewing of the movie . ' ' The train loomed over **28;9497; me <> on a big screen . I watched it over and over. ' ' // Spielberg has traveled a long road since then , becoming one of the world ' s most successful and respected directors . But that little boy is still lurking inside him , looking at the world  --  and the movies  --  with childlike awe . Sometimes he shares his happiest dreams , like ' ' E. T. , ' ' and sometimes he unleashes his darkest nightmares , like ' ' Poltergeist. ' ' // He always remembers that it ' s all make-believe , though , and like the Brothers Grimm , he makes sure that the bad guys get it in the end , no matter how threatening they may have appeared . <> <> Influential filmmaker // The late Rainer Werner Fassbinder , who passed on in Munich recently , was considered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Critics , directors , and international audiences responded to his dark vision of a world dominated by power structures , in which even the words ' ' I love you ' ' were more likely a bid for control than an expression of affection. // Fassbinder turned out films at a prodigious pace , completing about three a year during the peak of his career . It was said he could write a screenplay in the space of an airplane trip . In addition to directing his own scripts , he occasionally starred in them , as well as acting for other directors and producing films for his proteges. // His best movie was also his most popular with American viewers : ' ' The Marriage of Maria Braun , ' ' the story of a young woman who drags herself up the ladder of success in postwar West Germany . Especially in its first half , it blends more delicately than any other Fassbinder film the three elements that preoccupied him throughout his career  --  melodrama , irony , and real emotion . But his legacy is based mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation during the 1970s  --  a body of work that has often been praised indiscriminately , but stands nonetheless as one of the major achievements of the new German cinema ( Das Neue Kino ) that has produced such other talented figures as Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders. // //
