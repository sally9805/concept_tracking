Washington 's springtime lapse from civility is as worrisome as the issues that provoked the bitterness . Not in many a year have there been such relentless partisanship and personal rancor along the capital 's leafing avenues . There is no immunity . Not only has the running Democratic-Republican battle been raised to new intensity , but in the general melee , conservatives have attacked conservatives , legislative allies have thumped one another , special interests have zinged their benefactors , and friends have criticized friends . <P> Clark Clifford , the former Truman aide who has monitored the political mayhem for four decades , looked out his office window at the White House last week and said , " There is a greater stridency than I remember . We are in a troubled period . " The late Vice President Hubert Humphrey , himself battered by a wave of national protest , foresaw the problem years ago . " The first sign of a declining civilization , " he fretted , " is bad manners . " <P> A few weeks ago , Peter McPherson , Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain grants to famine victims in Africa and the U.N . ' s fund for population control . Paul Weyrich , director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress , turned on McPherson at one point and said , " You 're a disgrace . You are unfit to be in your current position . " Weyrich 's intemperance arose from his singular fears that American funds could be used for abortions and to feed starving people under Marxist governments . <P> Iowa 's new Democratic Senator Tom Harkin , barely introduced to the rituals of the cloakroom , was bumping along the back roads of Nicaragua a fortnight ago accusing President Reagan of " deception , distortion and duplicity . " Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk may have had a point when he said , " Give a member of Congress a junket and a mimeograph machine , and he thinks he is Secretary of State . " When Harkin and his fellow freshman Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts got home brandishing a cease-fire proposal from Nicaragua 's President Daniel Ortega Saavedra , the venerable Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfering in the President 's business . <P> Republicans swatted their House leader Robert Michel for being defeatist on contra aid . Reagan bashed Congress for " surrendering " to Communists . USIA Director Charles Wick , a close Reagan friend , zapped his old buddy for wanting to lay a wreath at the Bitburg cemetery . Jewish groups continued to denounce his German itinerary . Reagan has been a great booster of the military , but that did not stop the American Legion from getting in some licks about Bitburg too . <P> For several years Speaker Tip O'Neill has kept some key House committees at a 2-to-1 ratio of Democrats to Republicans . This has rankled the G.O.P. , which argues that a ratio of 3 to 2 would be more in line with overall party representation in the chamber . Last week that resentment flared over the contested Indiana seat that committee Democrats declared belonged to Frank McCloskey , one of their own . Even usually calm and gentle souls like Wyoming 's Dick Cheney declared war and kept the House sleepless and fuming through Monday night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
