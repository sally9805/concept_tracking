Watching a new TV season unfold may be mind numbing for some viewers , but for network executives it is an intense learning experience . Huddled over their weekly Nielsen report cards , they chart the winners and losers , try to divine trends and make mid-course corrections . Judging from the replacement series joining the prime-time schedule this month ( the traditional start of TV 's " second season " ) , the networks have done their homework . Herewith , the major lessons of autumn : <P> Keep soap operas in the family . Of all the flops of last fall , perhaps the most unexpected was ABC 's Paper Dolls . Set in the chic world of New York modeling , the series seemed expertly designed to satisfy the audience 's yen for opulent-looking trash . But viewers responded with a gigantic yawn . The show 's failure must have caused some nervous gulps at rival NBC , which was busily preparing a glossy soap set in the chic world of New York retailing . Oops . <P> Well , Berrenger 's may yet deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important element that was missing from Paper Dolls : a strong family unit . The Bloomingdale's-like department store of the title is run by an aging tycoon ( Sam Wanamaker ) whose children and their spouses vie for power and assorted sex partners . " Positively Byzantine , " remarks one family member , after Papa Berrenger has announced plans to retire . " It 's going to be fun watching this family fight their way through this . " Not as much fun , unfortunately , as it would be if the actors and plot twists did not look so much like mass-produced goods . One exception : Andrea Marcovicci , as a bitchy Berrenger wife , has an offbeat beauty and a mocking , low-key style that is a flavorful slice of rye in the white-bread surroundings . <P> TV detectives should mind their manners . Rough , tough crime fighters like NBC 's Hunter won relatively few fans last fall , while CBS 's civilized whodunit Murder , She Wrote , with Angela Lansbury as a sleuthing mystery writer , was a hit . Presto ! CBS has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like a Fox . The surprise of Murder , She Wrote is that , for all the echoes of Agatha Christie , Lansbury is not playing Miss Marple ; the irony of Crazy Like a Fox is that Jack Warden is . As a gruffly eccentric middle-aged private eye , he delights in getting his son , a button-down lawyer played by John Rubinstein , involved in oddball cases . Crazy Like a Fox is one of those shows where the car chases are accompanied by jaunty music , as if to say it 's all in fun . With some clever plots and a pair of appealing stars , it frequently is.
