Winning over another band ' s loyal audience is no minor feat . Opening acts are often booked by clubs , and regarded by concertgoers , as mere bill-fillers , there chiefly to be tolerated . Arms Akimbo , a hot-blooded Boston-based quintet that moved from Newport , RI , a year ago , simply can not be regarded with that sort of indifference . I ' ve seen them force a reaction and captivate a crowd three times - twice when they opened for Human Switchboard at the Inn-Square Men ' s Bar , and Friday night when they opened for the Dark at Storyville . Each time the enthusiastic response was well-deserved . Arms Akimbo plays fresh , energetic rock ' n ' roll that stakes its claim both on the dance floor and in the head . During the first half of Friday ' s set the curious crowd formed a semi-circle around the dance area ; by the end of the set that area was filled and the action was frenetic . Arms Akimbo ' s opening song Friday , a cover of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have a Real Good Time Together , " was a signal of the shape of things to come . In line with that song ' s **25;158;TOOLONG tone , Arms Akimbo offered good times that felt like they were fought for and , therefore , earned . There was a fine level of tension ; there was an equally fine level ofcut-loose mania . All of this was embodied in the physical presence of guitarist and frequent lead singer Greg Kendall . He often had this tight , wry smile , but when the music was pumping his body couldn ' t help but follow suit . Arms Akimbo draws from the more upbeat side of the Velvets ( as opposed to the more well-known moody , darker side ) , placing emphasis on strong rhythm guitars from any combination of Greg Kendall , Bob Kendall and Gary Smith .

Typical was " E Factor , " an instrumental that had a soaring , linear motion punctuated by Paul Gibson ' s thrashing of the crash cymbals . Arms Akimbo understands the concept of building pressure and then letting the steam go . Add to the Velvets ' influence , quirky songwriting twists similar to Elvis Costello ( especially songs sung by Smith ) , a fondness for trashy Booker T. and the MGs ' Farfisa-like organ lines , and in " You Probably Know Too Much , " sung by female bassist Bryson Dean , a splash of funk . Their clean , thoughtful arrangements - such as Dean darting in for a measure and then giving way to rhythm guitar bursts or whirring organ lines - recall the precision and range of early Talking Heads . There were a few weaknesses . Arms Akimbo tended to float light organ lines under the guitars most of the time , which sometimes muted the songs ' power .
