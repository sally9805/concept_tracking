When talks broke off , he said Abitibi had offered an 8% wage increase in each year . Abitibi officials could n't be reached for comment . As reported , the union initially sought a two-year contract with a wage increase of 20% in the first year and 17% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry is $10 ( Canadian ) an hour . The union contended these increases would put workers in eastern Canada on a parity with union members in western Canada . This year 's negotiations are taking place as market conditions for newsprint producers are deteriorating . Some producers earlier this year deferred a scheduled March 1 newsprint price boost of 5% in the U.S. to April 1 , citing high inventories and the U.S. recession . Producers that instituted the price boost on March 1 reportedly allowed publishers rebates and discounts . Industry officials previously have indicated that lower operating rates this year would force many mills to close for as long as eight weeks this summer .

In 1980. the union struck Abitibi for a month . Mr. Robb said the prospects of avoiding a strike " are n't looking good , but it 's too hard to call . " The union " might look better calling a strike rather than lowering their demands ( for a settlement ) and then having mills closed " because of weak markets , he said . Abitibi 's Mr. Allison said he hopes that after the two sides consider their positions . " there would be a resumption of talks under a mediator . "
