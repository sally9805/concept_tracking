Fanning political unrest <P> Two men on a motorcycle toss a bomb at an army staff car and speed away through the streets of Madrid : three people are killed in the blast , and a fourth , Lieut . General Joaquin Valenzuela , head of King Juan Carlos ' personal guard , is badly wounded . Another high-ranking officer , General Andrs Gonzlez de Suso , is gunned down at pointblank range outside his apartment in the capital , and a policeman dies in the ensuing chase . Almost simultaneously , two Civil Guards are murdered by terrorists in a Barcelona bar . The final toll : seven dead and 14 injured , most of them innocent bystanders . <P> Thus did political violence return to Spain last week at a critical moment for the country 's beleaguered young democracy . Ever since an abortive military coup last February , the army and the government have coexisted in an uneasy truce . Last week 's attacks clearly seemed to be aimed at undermining that shaky stability . The targets were exclusively military-men and police officers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government and called for the army to seize power . <P> The government said that the bombing of Valenzuela 's staff car was carried out by members of ETA , the Basque separatist organization responsible for most of the political terrorism in Spain . ETA confirmed it had carried out the attack . The other two incidents were suspected to mark the re-emergence of the October 1 Antifascist Resistance Group ( GRAPO ) , a mysterious organization described by the authorities as ultraleftist , that has surfaced sporadically in recent years . In the gun battle that followed Gonzlez de Suso 's assassination , police wounded and captured Emilio Gomez Gomez , 28 , allegedly a member of GRAPO . One of the two assailants in the Barcelona killings reportedly was among five GRAPO militants who staged a spectacular escape from a maximum-security prison in Zamora 17 months ago . <P> But the allegations raised a number of questions about GRAPO and the real perpetrators of last week 's attacks - given the country 's complex and conspiratorial politics . For one thing , Gonzlez de Suso is a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . GRAPO , skeptics noted , has materialized at other critical moments in Spain 's political life , each time to carry out operations that might easily , in truth , have been the work of right-wing hit squads . At the very least , the Madrid daily Diario 16 headlined , GRAPO was a leftist name with fascist objectives .
