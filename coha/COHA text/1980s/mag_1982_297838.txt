Right arms all over Hollywood would be deposited in the gene bank if it returned eyes as crystal blue as hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dusky voice and no little acting potential , and you have God 's recipe for a movie star . But if Farmer was a blessed presence in Samuel Goldwyn 's Come and Get It and a dozen B pictures , her life was one roiling curse . She was part of a movie age that glorified the strong-willed woman and punished the ac tresses who incarnated them . Hepburn , Davis , De Havilland were all mistreated by moguls who wanted their stars to behave like little women . Farmer was as willful as any of them - and far more troubled . The pressure drove her from the screen . It may have driven her mad . <P> Her fluttering tailspin-reaching bottom at a Dickensian snake pit where she was gang-raped by drunken G.I.s and subjected to every form of torture the psychiatric Establishment could devise , from shock treatment to massive doses of mind-bending drugs and , quite possibly , a transorbital lobotomy-is the stuff nightmares and film biographies are made of . Now a company of film makers is attempting just that : Frances , a $10 million movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her wildly eccentric mother Lillian . <P> They are filming a scene that took place Oct. 19,1942 , the night Frances was arrested for drunken driving . High on hauteur , Frances stands in the courtroom and taunts the judge with sarcasm . Then she realizes the consequences , asks to make a phone call and is dragged away screaming . Lange goes through the scene ten times-teasing , glaring , hating , crying , shrieking , allowing the camera to read the subtlest nuances on a face that remarkably resembles Farmer 's . Graeme Clifford , Lange 's editor on The Postman Always Rings Twice and her director on Frances , shouts " Cut ! Print ! " Lange goes limp ; she has reason to feel exhausted , and pleased .
