" The comment prompted another lecture , on cleaning methods , to which Cheryl listened with openmouthed interest . " You are just fantastic , Karen . I ca n't tell you how much I admire you . It takes a lot of gumption to start your own business . " " Gumption or stupidity . Sometimes I think I 've bitten off more than I can chew . " " Oh , no , if anybody can do it , you can . This is all new to me , and you seem to know everything about it . " " A few weeks ago I did n't know vintage chic from a hole in the ground , " Karen admitted . " I still have a lot to learn .

Joe 's insurance is stashed away , and if I 'm lucky I wo n't have to use it for an emergency ; so some day . . . But I 'll never be able to get into anything as glamorous and exciting as what you 're doing . You 're so lucky . " " Lucky , " Karen repeated thoughtfully . " Yes , I am . " " Oh , I did n't mean it was just luck . Without brains and hard work  --  " " You were right the first time , " Karen said , smiling . " It was luck  --  and a lot of help from my friends  --  that got me started . The brains are questionable , and the hardest work is yet to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . " Cheryl was clearly reluctant to leave . " I ca n't miss class , though , not if I want that A. Thanks for letting me bug you , Karen . I have n't had so much fun since I came to Washington . " Karen stood at the door watching as Cheryl trotted through the long shadows of early evening toward Wisconsin and a taxi . Cheryl certainly was easy to please . A woman who found a few hours of idle talk more entertaining than embassy dinners and cocktail parties would be thought hopelessly stupid by most observers . I had a good time too , Karen thought  --  and then , with a self-conscious smile  --  probably because I monopolized the conversation . She had been a little lonely , though not for former friends . The faculty wives with whom she had associated were almost all older than she , with interests and careers of their own . Jack did n't approve of her getting too friendly with academic inferiors . She knew what Jack would say aboutp51Cheryl . Not our kind . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snob Jack is , Karen thought casually . She went back inside and closed the door , never realizing that a landmark had been reached , a bridge had been crossed . She was thinking how quiet the house was , and how she really ought to get back to work on her records and lists . ON Friday Karen went with Mrs. MacDougal to the airport . She did not offer to drive ; this was to be the penultimate , perhaps the last , voyage of the 1938 Rolls Silver Cloud that was as much a Washington landmark as its owner . Karen half expected a motorcycle escort . They had said good-by to Joseph and the other servants , who were about to leave on well-deserved vacations . A security agency would watch over the house . But Mrs. MacDougal was not setting off for Borneo alone . " 1 may be old , but I 'm not senile , " she said tartly , when Karen expressed her concern . " I 'm taking Frank . " As if Frank were a suitcase . He was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDougal 's , a graduate history student who had jumped at the chance of earning a substantial salary for gallivanting around the Eastern Hemisphere all summer . Karen made a point of meeting him and decided he had the necessary qualifications : intelligence enough to deal with schedulesand officials , strength enough to pick Mrs. Mac up bodily if she fell down . He treated the old lady with a burlesqued gallantry that did not attempt to conceal his genuine affection . All the same , Karen felt a mournful foreboding as she watched her friend walk toward the terminal on Frank 's arm . Mrs. MacDougal did not look back . She had refused to let Karen come to the gate with her . At the last moment she had thrust a small shabby box into Karen 's hand and said brusquely , " A little something to remember me by . No , do n't start crying , dammit . I hate long , mushy good-bys . " And she glanced at the elaborate leather carrying case in which Alexander reposed . She certainly had not received any mushy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he thoroughly disapproved of it . All that could be seen of him was his hairless rump , for he had turned his back on the proceedings . The big glass doors of the terminal building glided smoothly aside ; the comically ill-matched pair , tall young man and withered old woman , passed through . The tears Karen had been forbidden to shed blurred herp52vision , but she saw Mrs. Mac stop to greet a man who was offering her something . . . flowers ? Yes , long-stemmed red roses . An upstart Volvo , impatiently awaiting its turn to unload passengers , had the effrontery to sound its horn , and the chauffeur put the Rolls in motion . Karen turned and craned her neck for a last look , without success ; people and cars obscured her view . She could have sworn the man with the flowers was Mark . It was possible . Mark had met Mrs. Mac while he and Karen were dating . Mrs. Mac had taken a fancy to him because he would argue with her about everything from politics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making polite concessions to her age and dignity . Pat had liked him for the same reason . The degree of Pat 's approval could be measured by the loudness of his voice and the number of times he banged on the table during a heated debate . Pat had never argued with Jack . The antipathy was mutual ; after the first few visits Jack always found an excuse for not accepting Ruth 's invitations . He had tried to keep Karen from going , but that was the one issue on which she stood up to him . Even after they moved to Iowa she managed to get to Washington every year or two  --  when Jack was also out of town , so her absence would n't inconvenience him . . . . With an effort she forced her mind away from thoughts of Jack , and from the inevitable corollary the memory had induced  --  " How could I have been such a wimp ? "  --  and leaned back , enjoying the luxurious ride . It was unlikely that she would ever occupy such an elegant vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a long list of potential buyers was anxiously awaiting Mrs. Mac 's final decision . Gliding in air-conditioned , velvet-cushioned comfort through the summercountryside , Karen began to feel more cheerful . The feeling that she would never see Mrs. Mac again was n't a premonition of approaching disaster , only a normal reaction to seeing an elderly friend off on a long trip . Whatever happened , she could rejoice in the knowledge that Mrs. Mac was doing precisely what she wanted to do , and would certainly have a wonderful time doing it . To be sure , the ominously silent presence of Alexander was not calculatedto lift her spirits . She avoided looking at the carrier ; in any case , Alexander 's rump was not a pretty sight . Through the glass partition that separated the front and back seats , she could see the chauffeur 's head and his heavy shoulders . She had met him for the first time earlier in the week , when he helped Joseph deliver Mrs. MacDougal 's clothing . He was the only one of the servants who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be good at his job ; the hugep53car slid sinuously through the traffic , with no change in speed and no delays . Not until then did Karen remember the worn leather case Mrs. MacDougal had given her . It lay on her lap , forgotten in the turmoil of departure . An amused , affectionate smile curved her mouth as she turned fit in her hands , seeking the catch that would open it . Heaven only knew what Mrs. Mac would consider an appropriate farewell gift ; the box might contain anything , from diamond earrings to a Mickey Mouse watch . Her fingers found and pressed the catch . The lid fell back . There were earrings , and a matching necklace ; but not , thank goodness , of precious stones . The earrings were long dangles , heavy and ornate ; the necklace choker length . Sections of black enamel edged in gold scrolls formed a background for flower-shaped insets made up of small pearls and sparkling stones , pale green and colorless . Karen detached one of the earrings from its mount and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects she was still learning about , but she knew enough to feel sure the set was not particularly valuable . The gold wash had worn off in places , showing a lighter metal beneath . Ordinarily she would never wear anything so ornate , but the necklace would look nice with some of the Victorian clothes . When they left the parkway and started up Wisconsin , Karen reached for her purse . She would never have dreamed of offering a tip to Joseph , but this young man was not of the old school . What was his name ? That at , feast she could offer , some acknowledgment of the fact that he was not simply an anonymous machine . Hawkins ? Higgins ? No  --  Horton . There was no parking space open near the house . Horton double-parked and was out of his seat and opening Karen 's door before she could move . He lifted Alexander 's carrier . " I can manage it , " Karen said . " There are the other things , miss . " " Oh , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water dishes , and his toys . A three-month supply of Alexander 's favorite foods had already been delivered , but it was unthinkable that Alexander should be deprived of his toys for so much as a second . " Just leave them , " Karen said , as the pile increased . " I do n't want you to get a ticket  --  " Horton 's lips parted in a small , amused smile . They were full , fleshy lips , of the sort some women might consider sexy . His other features and his bulky , heavily muscled body also fit the exaggerated macho image made popular by certain film stars . The trim jacket did n't actually strain across his broad chest  --  no subordinate of Joseph 's would ever be seen in publicp54in improperly fitted clothing  --  but the fabric looked as if it wanted to stretch . " I have my instructions , miss , " the chauffeur said sedately . " Please allowme . " Of course , Karen thought , watching him lift the boxes as effortlessly as if they had been empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets . Horton followed her into the hall . " Where would you like me to put them , miss ? " " Miss " instead of " madam . " Was that because Joseph could n't break his habit of referring to her as " Miss Karen , " or were they all obeying instructionsfrom Mrs. Mac , who would be delighted to see her resume her single status ? Mrs. Mac had never liked Jack . . . . Irrelevant and immaterial , Karen thought . Aloud she said , " Anywhere . Here . It does n't matter . " " The carrier is rather heavy , miss . Perhaps in the kitchen ? " His manner was perfectly respectful , but suddenly Karen realized that she did n't want him to go any farther into the house . His body seemed to fill the entire hallway . " No , " she said . " Just leave everything here . " " Yes , miss . " Horton touched his cap and turned to go . Karen thanked him and held out a folded bill . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was prepared for a well-bred rebuff , of the sort Joseph would have given her . Horton 's reactionwas even more disconcerting . His full lips parted in a broad , uninhibitedgrin . " Save it , doll . You probably need it worse than I do . " Karen gaped at him as he strutted  --  there was no other word for it  --  down the walk , his hands in his pockets , his uniform cap pushed rakishly askew . As the car glided away , he put his arm out the window and gave her an impudent wave . Karen laughed and waved back , though she knew Joseph would have fainted with horror at the gesture and her response . Horton must have had a hard time conforming to the formal standards the butler insisted upon . This was his last day on the job , his final public appearance ; he had nothing to lose by letting go . She forgot Horton as soon as she closed the door . There had been no comment from Alexander , but his face was now visible behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hair , but something about his pose told her Alexander was not in a good mood . Nerving herself for the encounter , she opened the carrier . " Okay , Alexander , this is it . I do n't like it any better than you do , so do n't give me a hard time . "  |p55She  retreated behind the carrier , hoping it would blunt the fury of Alexander'sattack . To her surprise he gave her only a cursory glance and then set out on a tour of the house . Because of his short legs and poor vision , this took an interminable time , necessitating the prolonged sniffing of everypiece of furniture . Karen was tempted to hurry him along with a wellplacedkick , but she was afraid to press her luck , even though she felt like an attendant pacing with measured steps behind some arthritic-ridden dowager empress . Not until he had inspected every room did Alexander return to the kitchen , where he sat down with a thump and gave a hoarse demanding bark . Karen ran to get his food dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , pausing long enough to lift his leg and sprinkle one of Ruth 's prize roses . Karen was too intimidated to protest . At least Alexander knew what needed to be done ; the would n't have to stand in the doorway exhorting him as she had heard Rachel do . Rachel was so nice-minded she refused to use even the polite euphemisms . " Now be a big doggie , " she would cry , in a horrible falsetto . " Be a good , big doggie , Alexander . " Karen had hoped Alexander would prefer to spend the day out-of-doors . The yard was fenced and shady ; but it was a hot day and Alexander did n't like hot weather . Before she could close the back door , he had returned . This time he went straight to the parlor , where he collapsed with a thud and a grunt on Ruth 's treasured pastel needlepoint hearthrug . Karen made an involuntary movement of protest , but before she could , order him off the rug Alexander shook his head vehemently , producing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had ever seen in a single optic . She stepped back . Alexander wriggled into a comfortableposition and began to snore . Annoyed as she was by the dog 's air of aristocratic hauteur , an air that accorded strangely with his distinctly plebeian appearance , Karen was also amused . Alexander had good taste . Perhaps the elegance of the room appealed to him . When Ruth was at home there were always flowers in the big silver bowls , according to the seasons  --  tulips and narcissus followed by lilac and sprays of dogwood , then roses and baby 's breath , and , to round out the year , great bunches of chrysanthemums in the pink and lavender shades Ruth favored . The dog 's snores were rather soothing . I 'll make up his bed for him later , in the kitchen , Karen told herself . In her heart of hearts she knew she had already lost the fight . Alexander had chosen his place and there he would stay . She would probably find herself arranging flowers in the silver bowls , to please his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landing reminded her that she wasp56late . She hurried upstairs , tugging at the belt of her dress . Julie had grudginglygiven her a few hours off so she could accompany Mrs. Mac to the airport , but this was Julie 's last day ; she was leaving for New England that evening , and for the next two weeks Karen would be in charge of the shop . Alexander was still asleep when she left the house , feeling decidedly selfconsciousin the vintage dress Julie had insisted she wear . It was an Edwardianafternoon gown , formal enough for a modern wedding , with a high , boned collar and a semi-train edged with lace . Karen had spent much of her spare time that week washing and ironing and mending and altering the dress . It was still too tight , but , she thought hopefully , not quite as tight as it had been when she first tried it on . One of Julie 's customers was coming in from Potomac to see the dress and the other gowns Karen carried , chastely enclosed in a garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was decent of her to let an employee use the premises to sell her own merchandise . Not that Julie 's motives were entirely altruistic . She got her cut . Besides , Mrs. Mac had graciously allowed Julie to acquire a few bits of bric-a-brac , china , and crystal . Julie hoped for more  --  much , much more . It had been her idea that Karen should model her wares whenever possible , and Karen had been forced to agree that it never hurt to advertise . In fact , she attracted less attention than she had expected . Georgetown was blase about unusual costumes . A few people stared , and one girl stopped her to ask where she had bought the dress . So Julie was right , Karen thought ; one potential customer in a three-block walk was n't bad . Her positive mood did n't last , though ; Julie 's behavior that afternoon would have driven a saint to homicide . She showered Karen with instructionsas confused as they were impossible to carry out ; and when , for the sixth or seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , God , I must be crazy to leave town ! " Karen 's temper snapped . " Then do n't . Lord knows I 've got enough to do without running your business for you ! " " Oh , sweetie , do n't pay any attention to me , " Julie cried . " You know how I am  --  " " To my sorrow . You do n't even need me , Rob could handle things here . And if an emergency should arise , you 're only a few hours away . " " Do n't you dare call unless it 's a real emergency . " Julie 's eyes took on a faraway look . " I have a really interesting two weeks planned , if you know what I mean . " " Nothing will go wrong , " Karen said . " Why do n't you leave right now ? You are n't accomplishing anything except driving both of us up the wall . " " And me , " came a voice from the rear of the shop . " Listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves . I shall burst into tears if I hear one more unkind word . " Julie paid no attention to this pathetic speech . She glanced at her watch . " I ca n't leave until Mrs. Schwarz comes , she 'd be horribly offended . Damn the woman , where is she ? She said three , and it 's already three-thirty . " Mrs. Schwarz arrived at 4:10 , apologizing and complaining about the traffic on the bridge . It was a handy excuse for anyone coming into the District , because it was usually true . She shrieked with rapture at Karen 's dress and asked to try it on . Karen complied , though one look at Mrs. Schwarz 's comfortable contours convincedher the customer had n't a prayer of getting into the dress . She did get into it , with a great deal of assistance from Julie and Karen , and the collapse of only one side seam . However , the dress refused to meet at the back . Mrs. Schwarz said wistfully , " Perhaps if I wore a tighter girdle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at the six-inch gap . " You could n't let it out ? " " I 've let it out as far as it will go . " Karen added , " I should n't wear it either ; it was made for a girl with a tiny waist and hardly any bust . You know , it 's impossible to wear clothing like this if it 's even the teeniest bit too small . The fabric is old and fragile , and the styles were n't designed for active women . " " I suppose you 're right . " Mrs. Schwarz was appeased by the tactful phrase " teeniest bit too small , " though it most certainly did not apply in her case . " Oh , well , such is life . I hope I have n't damaged the dress , dear . If I have , I 'll be happy to pay  --  " " No , that 's all right , " Karen said , carefully skinning the dress over Mrs. Schwarz 's head . " One of the seams gave a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , you do your own alterations ? That 's nice to know . I must tell my friends about you . " Mrs. Schwarz bought one of the other dresses , a turn-of-the-century day dress of gold linen , hand-embroidered at the neck and hem . After she had departed in triumph , promising a return visit when Karen had more clothes ready , Karen stared in disbelief at Mrs. Schwarz 's check . It was made out for two hundred and fifty dollars . " I would n't have dared ask that much , " she exclaimed . " I must say , Julie , I admire your nerve . " " You wo n't get prices like that out in the boonies , " Julie said sourly . " That 's fifty you owe me . I ought to get more , actually , since I set the price , but since it 's you . . . " " She must be crazy , " Karen said . " The dress did n't even look good on her . "  | " That may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest you keep such opinions to yourself . And remember , do n't accept a check from anyoneexcept the people on that list I gave you . Not even if the customer arrives in a chauffeur-driven Mercedes and is swathed in mink .

" Julie wrung her hands . " Oh , God ! I must be mad to do this ! "  |p59BY  the time she finally persuaded Julie to leave , Karen had a splitting headache . Almost immediately Rob pranced away , golden curls agleam  --  " I anticipate a most interesting evening , my dear ; I must save my strength ! "  --  leaving the task of locking up to Karen . It was a complex procedure , involving an alarm system and an arrangement of steel grilles , and she performed it with painstaking concentration . It did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as interesting as he hoped , he would probably be late to work next day . As she headed homeward , holding her flounces high above the dirty sidewalk , she wondered uneasily what Alexander had been up to during her absence . Mrs. MacDougal let him roam freely among her treasures , and even Rachel admitted grudgingly that he was not destructive ; but it was impossible to predict what he might do in a new environment , particularly if he resented the change . Karen 's steps quickened , even though she knew it was silly to hurry now . Alexander had had all afternoon to work his will . He was not on the hearthrug , nor was that precious article damaged except for the inevitable accumulation of dog hair . Karen called . There was no answer . She found Alexander in the kitchen standing by the back door . It was n't difficult to deduce what he wanted , and she praised him effusively as shep60let him out . By a simple twitch of his shoulders Alexander expressed his contempt for this transparent attempt to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Karen thankfully removed her elaborate and uncomfortable dress and settled down at the kitchen table with a glass of iced tea and the mail . Most of it was for Pat  --  professional journals , appeals for money from various causes worthy and unworthy , and a few bills . Karen put these aside to be dealt with later ; her aunt and uncle had set up an account in her name so that she could pay the householdexpenses . She drew on it for her own needs , because she had to  --  the wages Julie gave her barely covered expenses  --  but she was keeping track of everything she spent on herself , with the intention of paying it back as soon as she could . The only thing for her was a letter from a lawyer in Dubuque . It was the fourth such epistle she had received . She had not opened any of them , and after hesitating for a moment , she laid this one aside . Her headache was subsiding , but she was in no mood to cope with the painful emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note in the box of her clothes , Jack had not communicated directly with her . Perhaps it was unfair to blame him . She had n't written or called him either . I suppose I ought to find a lawyer , she thought listlessly . Another unpleasantduty she had put off . . . . Well , she could n't do anything about it until Monday . Offices were closed on the weekend and office workers , including lawyers , were relaxing at home , picnicking , entertaining friends . Enjoying themselves . Unlike some people , who had nothing to look forward to except the company of a homely , malevolent dog , and a pile of old clothes to mend . At least she could get out of the house that evening . She had an appointment with another of Mrs. MacDougal 's friends , who had old laces and linens and a few pieces of clothing she might be willing to sell . Such visits had all the fascination of a voyage of exploration into unknown lands ; one never knew what would turn up , junk or jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation was tempered with mild trepidation , for Mrs. Mac had warned her that Mrs. Ferris was a very old friend indeed  --  " practically gaga " had been her appraisal . Karen had protested . " I ca n't take advantage of someone who is senile . And suppose she changes her mind later , and accuses me of cheating or robbing her ? " " Oh , she has her lucid moments . Just make sure she signs a receipt and get the housekeeper to witness it . Betsy is a good soul , she 's been with Joan Ferris for years . " Alexander demanded entry , so Karen let him in and fed him . He was only supposed to eat once a day , but she had no intention of trying top61enforce rules Alexander did n't choose to obey . It was far too late in the game to turn him into a well-behaved , well-trained dog , even if she had felt strong enough to make the attempt . He deserved a little extra treat anyway . He must be missing his owner ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing wrong with his appetite . He polished off his food to the last crumb , belched , and then headed for the parlor , where he lay down on the rug before Karen could stop him . I 'll do something about the rug later , she told herself cravenly . There 's no time now , I must n't be late . Mrs. Ferris probably goes to bed at sunset . However , before she could leave the house the telephone rang . Karen had been thinking about the letters from the lawyer ; it came as something of a shock to hear the speaker identify himself as a member of the same profession . " I do n't suppose you remember me , miss  --  I beg your pardon , it 's Mrs. , is n't it ? I 'm afraid I ca n't recall your married name . " " Nevitt . But it wo n't be my name long . " " I beg your pardon ? " " That 's why you called , is n't it ? About my divorce ? I do remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call you , but I must say I 'm surprised Ruth would take it upon herself to talk to you without consulting me first . " " You refer , I presume , to the younger Mrs. MacDougal ? " " You are her lawyer , are n't you ? " " Our firm represents Mr. and Mrs. Patrick MacDougal , yes . We also represent Mrs. MacDougal senior . " He waited just long enough for Karen to realize that she had jumped to conclusions . Then he went on in tones of freezing politeness , " I assure you that no one has approached me on the matter of your domestic difficulties . I called about another matter en-tirely . " " I 'm sorry , " Karen muttered . " I 'm a little upset , Mr. Bates , or I t would n't have said that . Please excuse me . " " Certainly . " The lawyer 's voice thawed slightly . " I understand . Ordinarilywe do n't handle divorce cases , but if you would like me to recommendsomeone . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day next week . I do hope nothing has happened to Mrs. MacDougal ? " " So far as I know , she is winging her way westward , " the lawyer replied poetically . " It is not Mrs. MacDougal but her automobile that is the object of my concern . " " The Rolls ? What 's happened to it ? " That , Mr. Bates explained , was the problem . The car had not been delivered to the garage at the appointed time . The owner of the garage hadp62not become concerned for several hours . He had been busy , and like everyone else in Washington , he considered traffic delays part of the normal scheme of things . Mr. Bates had not been notified until midafternoon , and it had taken several more hours to convince the alarmed lawyer that the car had indeed been stolen . " But that 's impossible , " Karen exclaimed . " The Rolls is unique . How could anyone make off with it ? " " How it was done is still unknown . That it was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chauffeur 's quarters have been cleared out and the man himself has vanished .

It is likely that the automobile was driven into a large closed van , which may now be well on its way to ... anywhere . " " Oh , dear . " " You may well say so , " remarked Mr. Bates morosely . " Joseph  --  poor Joseph ! How is he taking it ? " " Very badly indeed . He blames himself . Quite unnecessarily ; it is no one 's fault . All precautions were taken .

I expressed myself badly ; I am , I confess , somewhat distraught . " Karen could almost see the lawyer mopping his brow . She did n't blame him ; Mrs. MacDougal might not hold him responsible , but she could certainly be annoyed , and she was not in the habit of mincing words . The lawyer went on , " It is necessary to assume that this was not , in police parlance , a one-man job . Whether the others involved were professionalthieves or only amateurs is as yet unknown . It is probable that the automobile was the sole object of their interest .

She knew what the lawyer was driving at , and she did n't like the idea at all . " You mean they  --  he  --  that big hulk of a chauffeur  --  might try to break in here ? " " No , no , you mistake my meaning . I consider it most unlikely . Quite unlikely indeed . I have no desire to alarm you  --  " " Well , you have !

" Diamonds ? Emeralds ? I thought they were peridots and rhinestones  --  " " The stones themselves are not valuable , " said Mr. Bates . " However , the jewelry belonged to Dolley Madison . It is depicted in the Warren portrait , and its pedigree is authenticated . " " Oh , my  --  oh , good Lord ! Honestly , I had no idea  --  I 'll bring it right over to your office .

You are certain she did n't give you the Beall emeralds or ask you to store her collection of Revere silver ? I am relieved to hear it . Though the necklace and earrings are historic treasures , they are not intrinsically valuable , so I do n't believe you need worry . " After he had hung up Karen took off the necklace and sat staring at it . So much for her expertise on the subject of antique jewelry ! She had n't even dated it correctly . It was n't Victorian but Georgian , dating from the early part of the nineteenth century , before Victoria ascended the throne . So Mr. Bates did n't believe she needed to worry . He was fairly sure thep64necklace and earrings would not attract a thief . It was nice that Mr. Bates was so unconcerned . Even if the gang to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , they might not be interested in the jewelry . The individual stones were n't worth much , and the set could not be pawned ; it would be instantly recognized . But the same thing was true of the Rolls . And Horton knew she had the jewelry ; not only had he seen Mrs. Mac give her the case , but she had removed one of the earrings during the drive back from the airport  --  held it up in full view of anyone who might glance into the rearview mirror . Her fingers moved respectfully over the smooth surface of the enamel , the settings of the small gems . James Madison , fourth President of the United States , might have fastened the clasp around Dolley 's plump neck . Dolley had worn it or carried it with her when she and the President escaped from Washington with the flames of the burning city reddening the sky behind them  --  the only time the capital had been sacked and destroyedby an invading enemy . Dolley had taken it all in her stride  --  a plump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her look taller . Washington Irving , among other admirers , had praised her beauty and contrasted it with the feeble face and diminutive figure of her husband . Pretty Dolley , with a pretty woman 's fondness for nice clothes and jewelry . . . The only reason Karen knew these things was that , by a strange coincidence , she had been reading about Dolley Madison only the night before , in the Georgetown legends book Julie had given her . Dolley was n't really a Georgetown ghost , but she was certainly one of the most peripatetic of Washington 's revenants , and as the author frankly admitted , distinguished spirits lent a book a certain cachet . Among other places , Dolley had been seen ( ? ) in one of the old mansions on Dumbarton Avenue , where she must have danced and partied a number of times . Karen put the necklace back in the case and checked to make sure the earrings were solidly fastened . She could n't get to the bank tonight . Where could she hide the jewelry in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wardrobe . It was n't very secret , since the hinges could be seen by anyone who looked closely , but it was the best she could do for Dolley at the moment . Not that she really thought she was in danger of being burglarized . Horton had not struck her as the type who went in for esoteric objets d'art . Cars , yes . Perhaps he had simply fallen in love with the glamorous old automobile , as a woman might with a gown or a jewel , and had persuaded a few friends to join him in what must have seemed an irresistible opportunity . If she had not been so distressed on Mrs. MacDougal 's account ,  |p65Karen  could have laughed when she remembered Horton 's sudden descent from the formal manners of a hired employee . And the sheer effrontery of his last remark . . . . The five-dollar tip must have seemed a howling joke to him when he was about to make off with a car worth hundreds of thousands . But as she showered and dressed she kept seeing Horton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her  --  his heavy features and massive chest ; his hands , twice the size of hers . Harmless enough , no doubt ; but not the figure one would like to meet in a dark alley . Or in a room of one 's own house . THE telephone call had delayed her . She arrived breathless and perspiring on Mrs. Ferris ' doorstep . Externally the house on Thirty-sixth Street resembledRuth 's  --  a red brick Georgetown Federal of approximately the same age . Unlike its neighbors which it also resembled , it had a forlorn appearance ; the small front yard was filled with weeds and the windows on the ground floor had draperies or shades drawn , like blind white eyes . Karen 's knock was promptly answered by a stout , smiling woman with gray hair arranged in an astonishing beehive coiffure . She drew Karen inside . " I 'm sure glad to see you , honey . Glad to see anybody , to tell the truth ! You do n't mind if I call you Karen , do you ? Miz MacDougal talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's about the only human soul that ever comes here , God bless her . I 'd just about go loony from lonesomenessif it was n't for her  --  and my soaps , of course . Could n't live withoutmy soaps . " The vestibule was a gloomy cavern lit only by a single bulb in the chandelier . " Sorry about the dark , " the housekeeper went on in a lower voice . " She "  --  with a significant nod at a shadow-filled doorway  --  " she does n't like to waste electricity . Old age takes some people that way . Miserly . Do n't let her cheat you on them old scraps she 's trying to sell . " " I wo n't . " Karen was grateful for an ally . A quavery , querulous voice issued from the cavernous darkness of the parlor . " Who 's that ? Who are you talking to , Betsy ? Is it that girl ? Bring her in , bring her in ; do n't stand out there whispering about me . I can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At first glance Mrs. Ferris was only a shapeless bundle , swathed in shawls and lap rugs despite the stifling heat of the room . The housekeeper turned on an overhead light and the bundle took on identity . The face thatp66peered at Karen was a mass of wrinkles , the head almost hairless except for a few dry white wisps ; but the eyes that met hers were alive and aware . " Turn that off , Betsy , " the old woman croaked . " Waste , always waste ! " Betsy winked at Karen . " Now , Miz Ferris , how can the young lady look at your junk in the dark ? " Mrs. Ferris acknowledged the truth of the statement with a grunt . Her clawed hands fumbled at something on her lap . Blinking in the light  --  dim enough in itself , but dazzling after the gloom that had prevailed before  --  Karen was afraid to move from the doorway . The room was so cluttered with furniture , there was scarcely room to pass between the little tables and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaus and desks . And every surface was strewn with fabric . Crumpled silks and ragged linens draped the chairs , scraps of embroideryand lace black with dirt lay heaped on tables and footstools . Karen 's heart dropped down into her sandals . Junk was right . How was she going to get out of here without buying something she could n't use ? Mrs. Ferris raised her hands . Suspended from her twisted fingers was a web of creamy lace . " My wedding veil , " she croaked . " Valenciennes . Worth a fortune . How much ? " The transaction took hours . At first the old lady haggled over every item and told interminable stories about each scrap . The stories , some tragic , some touching , some frankly slanderous , would have fascinated Karen if she had known any of the people concerned , and if she had not been so hot . She could n't decide whether Mrs. Ferris was too stingy to turn on the air-conditioning , or so old she needed heat to keep her body functioning . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her blouse stick to her body . As time went on , she would have been glad to pay any price just to get away , but the housekeeper 's nods and winks confirmed her suspicion that Mrs. Ferris was enjoying the company , and the bargaining . At last she began to tire and to wander down pathways into the past , addressing Karen as Susie ( " Her daughter , " the housekeeper whispered . " Just say , yes , Mama . ' " ) When Karen offered a flat sum for the last few boxes , sight unseen , she nodded wearily . She perked up , though , when Karen handed over the money  --  Mrs. MacDougal had warned her she would be expected to pay cash  --  and scribbled her name on the prepared receipt . Karen had to call a taxi to carry away the loot , and when she left the room Mrs. Ferris was chuckling to herself as she counted the bills and silver , briskly as a bank cashier . As she stood on the step with Betsy , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old dear a real shot in the arm . She 'll squirrel that money away before I get back in the room ; Lord knows how muchp67she 's got tucked away , under chair cushions and behind pillows . And she 'll talk for days about what a sharp bargainer she is . " " I hope I did n't cheat her . " " Good land , honey , that stuff has been rotting in the attic for thirty years or more . I 'm glad to get it out of the house . " " But wo n't her children resent her selling family heirlooms ? I mean , the wedding veil  --  " " Well , honey , it 's hers , is n't it ? Seems to me she 's entitled to do what she wants with it . There 's no family except a daughter and granddaughter , and they sure do n't put themselves out any for her ; one of ' em comes by every month or so , and it 's downright indecent how disappointed they are when they find she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey . " The cabdriver good-naturedly helped Karen carry the overflowing cartonsto the door and then left , his headlights cutting twin beams through the darkening street . Alexander ambled to the door and Karen began tugging the boxes into the house . She was anxious to examine her purchases in a decent light . Either she had made an excellent deal or she had just wasted $78.50 . If it was the former , she had no qualms ; she had had to work for every penny . As she dragged the last of the boxes inside , the dog made a sudden dart for the door . Karen grabbed and missed ; Alexander scampered down the steps and ran to the gate , barking furiously . Thank goodness she had closed the gate . She went after the dog . He hadstopped barking , but he seemed to be intent on something across the street . A pool of darkness had gathered there , equidistant between two streetlights . The windows of the opposite house were unlighted . After a moment Alexander turned and went back into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyer . She was sorry to have been reminded . Not that Alexander 's aggressivenesswas significant ; he might have been barking at a squirrel or a shadow . Nevertheless she retreated quickly into the house and locked the front door . Alexander was sniffing at the cartons . A violent sneeze indicated his opinion ; he stalked off , shaking his head . Karen pulled the boxes into the dining room . She had cleared the long table and covered the surface with thick layers of newspaper so she could use it as a work table . She began unloading her purchases . At first she was inclined to agree with Alexander , and her heart sank . Seventy-eight dollars was n't much money , she supposed , but from the point of view of someone who had none at all , it was too much to waste on material that could never bring a profit . Just touching the fabrics made her want to scrub her hands . She reminded herself that she had been spoiledp68by the superb condition of Ruth 's and Mrs. MacDougal 's clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends had not been up to that standard , but neither had they been as bad as this . Most of the cloth reeked of mold and mustiness . Some appeared to have been stored without being washed . She shook out a long pink organdy dress stained all down the front ; it looked as if it had been wrapped around a rusty iron frying pan . But there were treasures among the trash . The laces were beautiful , ranging from separate pieces of edging and insertion only a foot long to big sections large enough to have been overskirts or dress panels . Most were of cotton ; they would respond well to plain soap and water . She took a double handful of laces , some of the ones that would require what her pamphlets called " heroic treatment , " and carried them upstairs . Filling the basin in the bathroom with warm water and detergent , she left them to soak overnight . Tomorrow she would rinse them thoroughly and wash them again , adding a small amount of ordinary bleach to the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the weekend . Karen raised the window in the master bedroom , which looked over the street . The house across the way showed lighted windows now ; the sound of voices drifted across to her . A puff of stale , hot air warmed her face and she lowered the window . Georgetown gardens were beautiful , but she did n't envy the people who were sitting in the one across the street , talking and drinking and having fun , in spite of the heat . At least she did n't envy them much ... . She went downstairs . Alexander raised his head when she turned on the lights in the parlor , but he did not move . He had refused to occupy his bed  --  antique basketry , lined with crushed velvet  --  when it was in the kitchen , so Karen had given up and put it in the parlor , on the hearthrug . " Come on , " she said . Her voice sounded strange in the empty room . " You 're not much , Alexander , but you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " A rude sniff was the only reply . Karen had been prepared for a refusal . She held out the chicken breast she had taken from the refrigerator . Alexanderwas passionately fond of chicken  --  only the white meat , of course . It took a while , but she finally got Alexander , and his bed , into her room . The only book on the bedside table was the Georgetown legends book . The phantom of Dolley Madison held no charm for Karen that night ; she found a children 's book in one of the bookcases in the hall . Little Women was as bland and harmless as a piece of literature could be , and it finally put Karen to sleep . Yet she dreamed that night , for the first time since Ruth and Pat had left . She dreamed Horton was waltzing with Mrs. Ferris , he in his chauffeur 's uniform , she swathed in her wed/ding veil like a mummy in its wrappings . The dance grew wilder and Horton lifted the fragile old woman clear off her feet , whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music swelled she shriveled and turned brown , until she was a leaf , sere and dead , but giant in size . Then Horton , grinning till his gums showed , let her go and she fluttered in diminishing circles around the room until someone opened a window and out she blew into the darkness . A faint shriek , like the squeal of a rusty hinge , shivered and died into silence . KAREN had never believed in the virtues of being early to bed and early to rise , but in Washington , in the summer , the second part of the adage made good sense . From dawn to midmorning  --  sometimes earlier , during a severeheat wave  --  the temperature was at least tolerable . It was a surprisingly sociable time of day , too . Joggers and runners and exercise buffs were out in full force , not only because of the relative coolnessbut because most of them worked during the day . Karen had been jogging , or trying to , for over a week . The first time she emerged from the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been self-consciousand a little uneasy . Now she enjoyed it . There was a camaraderie among the would-be healthy , a pleased awareness of their superiority over the slothful majority who were still snoring in their beds . The truly dedicatedran in a state of profound detachment from reality , their eyes fixed on vacancy , their faces bright-red and streaming ; but there were plenty like Karen , who had time for a friendly wave or grin , or gasped greeting , as they stumbled along . The tree-lined streets seemed cooler than they really were , and the towpath along the old B and 0 Canal was delightful at that time of day , shaded by surrounding buildings , with the water rippling gently under the footbridges . Julie had given her a copy of the " new diet . " Julie collected diets , though as far as anyone could observe she followed none . Karen was trying to stick to this one , though she found cottage cheese for breakfast an abomination difficult to accept , much less enjoy . It was only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time enough to do a load of laundry before she went to work . She could n't believe how much she enjoyed washing clothes  --  not even in a machine , but tediously and carefully by hand . The pamphlets she had obtained from the Smithsonian and the book Mrs. Mac had supplied intimidated her at first , with their dire warningsp70and their insistence on distilled water and special cleansing agents . In fact , they were singularly lacking in practical , precise advice . Most were written by or for museum curators , whose chief concern was preservation rather than appearance or wearability ; Karen got the distinct impression that if these experts could have had their way , the garments would n't even have been displayed , but would have been packed away forever in special con tainers , safe from damaging light and touch . The few books written for wearers and sellers of vintage clothing went to the opposite extreme . If the clothes ca n't be washed and cleaned by ordinary methods , do n't bother with them , was the gist of their advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense in most cases . Anxious experimentation had proved to her that the white linens and cottons responded beautifully to soap and water and a careful use of bleaching agents . She learned to detect worn spots that might give way when wet , and she found that some long-set stains such as rust could not be removed without destroying the cloth itself . She tried the old methods  --  sun-bleaching , or lemon juice and water with a pinch of salt . One of Mrs. Mac 's friends , delighted at finding an interested listener , told her how the frilly voluminous undergarments had been laundered when she was a girl  --  scrubbed by hand on a ridged washboard , starched and sprinkled and rolled and ironed with heavy irons heated on the stove . Karen was n't moved to buy a washboard or give up her handy electric steam iron , but she searched the stores for old-fashioned Argo starch and followed the directions on the box , boiling and straining and diluting it as directed . It gave a better finish than spray starch , her mentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Karen 's pleasure was purely sensuous . It was good to handle the natural fabrics , linens and cottons and silks , and to see them transformed as if by magic from dingy , crumpled wads of cloth to garments dazzling in their whiteness and perky with starch . There was another reason why she enjoyed a job she would once have considered unworthy of her intelligence . This job had visible , tangible results . They hung in lacy elegance from hangers and rods , and danced on the drying lines strung across the garden . They were the product of her own labors and her own good sense , and they would mean money in the bank  --  money she had earned . All she had ever gained from her long hours of labor for Jack was an occasional line in the finished book . " And finally I must thank my wife , who typed the manuscript . . . . " In the morning light the laces she had bought the previous night looked even better than she had hoped . She washed and bleached and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were full . Karen re/warded herself with a second cup of coffee  --  black  --  and sat down on the terrace to relax for a few minutes and admire the results of her labors . She wondered how long it would be before the neighbors complained . The look was definitely not Georgetown , and even though the high fence ensured a degree of privacy , old Mr. DeVoto , who lived in the house to the north , was a first-class busybody . Let him object , she thought defiantly . But it would be nice to have her own place , in the country or in a small town , where the air was free of exhaust fumes and smog . She could n't go on living with Ruth and Pat . Even if pride had not forbidden such a course , her uncle 's temper would surely crack if he had to fight his way through dangling linens and laces every time he wanted to sit on the terrace or use the bathroom . Karen arrived at the shop promptly at eleven , to find that Rob had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unexpected development were cut short when Rob informed her that he was taking the afternoon off . He brushed her protests aside with an airy wave of the hand . " Darling , you must have more confidence in yourself . It 's a piece of cake . I mean , sweetie , what 's the problem ? " The problem was that Saturday was the busiest day of the week , when it would have been advantageous to have two people on duty . Rob knew this as well as Karen did , but although she was sorely tempted to give him a piece of her mind , she decided it was not worth the effort . She had no authority to hire or fire employees ; if Rob took umbrage at her criticism and quit she would be left with no help at all . Like Alexander , he was n't worth much , but he was better than nothing . She wondered how he managed to keep his job . He must have some hold over Julie , to get away with such a casual attitude ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't believe Rob and Julie were lovers , though . Surely Rob would n't flaunt his affairs so flagrantly if that were the case . Perhaps there had been something between them in the past . Rob left at two , reeking of some strong , supposedly sexy aftershave , and smirking in a way that made Karen want to throw something at him . Business was brisk . She did n't sell much , but the shop bell never stopped tinkling and she did n't have a moment to sit down . Finally , at around four , the traffic began to slow . The sunshine without was hazy with heat , and most people were heading for Happy Hour . Karen had just collapsed into a chair when the telephone rang . Instead of reaching for it she eyed it warily ; she was still smarting from the last call , from a dealer who had some urgent business with Julie  --  an appointmentshe had obviously forgotten , since she had said nothing about it . The dealer , not a well-bred man , had taken his ire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another such encounter.  |p72However  , the phone had to be answered . The voice that replied to her formal " Old things . May I help you ? " was familiar . " Karen ? This is Cheryl . Mark 's sister . " " Oh , hello . " " Hello . I just happened to be in I mean , I was wondering I thought maybe you 'd like to go to dinner or a movie or something tonight . I know it 's awfully short notice  --  " " That 's no problem , " Karen said . " I 'm not exactly the most sought after female in Washington . " " That makes two of us . Anyway , we 're not alone ; what 's the ratio of women to men in this town  --  three to one ? " " More like ten to one , I think . " " I guess it feels that way to lots of women , " Cheryl agreed . " Look , youdo n't have to say yes just for politeness . If you had other plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had planned to spend the evening washing andironing clothes . Not exactly a wild and frivolous time . " " It sounds absolutely thrilling compared to what I was looking forward to . " " I suppose Mark is busy , " Karen said . Just like Mark , she was thinking  --  bringing the poor girl here to cook and keep house for him while he goes to all those glamorous parties . . . " He has to work tonight , the poor guY I try to keep out of his way when he 's preparing a speech or writing a bill , or whatever it is they do up there on the Hill . He wanders around the house talking to himself and running into the furniture  --  " " Here comes a customer , " Karen said , as the door opened . " Can I call you back ? " " Well , uh . . . I 'm at a phone booth , actually , and . " " Which just happens to be in the neighborhood ? " Karen remembered Cheryl 's first unfinished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop and we 'll decide what we want to do . " The customer was looking for antique jewelry . Karen displayed Julie 's few pieces of Art Deco and Art Nouveau , and the customer , who was only interested in Victorian and Georgian jewelry , departed . The next person to enter was Cheryl . Karen realized she could n't have been more than two blocks away when she called . Her curls were limp with damp and her perspiring face shone like a mirror , but her smile would have cheered the most confirmed misogynist . You ca n't help being glad to see her , Karen thought ; she 's so openly glad to see you. nounced " Boy , it 's hot out there , " Cheryl an , with the air of someonep73who has just made a new scientific discovery . " Are you all alone ? Where 's your assistant ? " " It 's a moot point as to who is assisting whom , or if anybody is assisting anybody , " Karen said . " That bad , huh ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitchy mood . This is my first day without Julie and Rob decided to take the afternoon off . I guess I 'm a little nervous . It 's a big responsibility . " " Good experience , though , " Cheryl said . " For running your own place . " " It 's teaching me what not to do , at any rate . All this clutter and confusionis n't my style . It 's too hard to keep track of things and people . " " Do you have much shoplifting ? " Cheryl sounded as if she were genuinelyinterested . That was all Karen needed . She did n't stop talking until she was interrupted by another customer , and after she had dealt with him she was surprised to see that it was after five . " We have n't even discussed what we 're going to do this evening , " she said , adding apologetically , " I did n't mean to monopolize the conversation . It 's just that I have so much to do and it 's on my mind all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheryl said enthusiastically . " I would n't say that . " Karen began the complicated process of closing up . " The clothes themselves are fun , I love that part of it , but when I think about finding the right location and getting more stock and all the business end . . . I guess that 's it . We can go now . " " What computer system are you going to get ? " Cheryl asked , helping Karen pull the grille across the door . " Oh , God , do n't mention computers ! I 'm going to start with a few oldfashionedledgers . Maybe I can deal with them , I know I ca n't learn how to handle a computer . " " But that 's  --  " Cheryl stopped suddenly . " All set , " Karen announced , dropping the keys into her purse . " I have to go home to check on the dog anyway ; why do n't we have a drink there and discuss our plans ? " They never did discuss plans for the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a restaurant . By the time they reached the house Karen was talking nonstop , her half-formulated plans and unexpressed worries pouringout in a verbal flood . Missing Mrs. MacDougal for her laughter and her companionship and her support , she had not realized how much she also missed a sounding board for new ideas . Cheryl was a perfect audience , asking an occasional question at just the right moment.  |p74Alexander  was waiting at the door , and not until she actually saw his featureless furry face did Karen remember she had failed to warn Cheryl of his habits . She tried to grab him as he charged , missed as she always did ; cried out in warning . . . . Cheryl 's lifted foot caught Alexander square in the chest and tipped him gently onto his backside . For a moment he balanced , paws flailing in the air , jaws still moving ; then he toppled over backward . " I did n't kick him , " Cheryl said earnestly . " He just ran into my foot ; he is n't hurt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Alexander rolled over and strolled away . " Serves him right . He 's not my dog , I was conned into keeping him for a friend . " " Mrs. MacDougal ? " " Why yes . How did you know ? " " She 's a friend of Mark 's . I 've met her a couple of times ; she 's a sweetheart . Say , what 's this story about her car being stolen ? " So it might well have been Mark she had seen at the airport , saying good-by . With red roses , yet ... . Karen explained about the Rolls as they trailed an aloof Alexander to the kitchen and tended to his needs . She found that Cheryl already knew the details , for Mark had called the lawyer that morning after seeing a paragraph in the newspaper . " I do n't think that lawyer appreciated having Mark call him , " Cheryl said seriously . " I could n't hear what he said , of course , but Mark answered him back in that cold , cutting way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never trusted that man  --  the chauffeur  --  and he would n't have hired him to look after a used Chevy , much less a car worth half a million bucks . I figure he must have been exaggerating , do n't you ? How could any car be worth that much ? " " He may have exaggerated , I do n't know about such things ; but it was valuable  --  custom-built , and very expensive to begin with . " " You saw the guy , did n't you ? Did he look like a crook ? " Karen was not anxious to discuss Horton , but the naive question made her laugh . " Crooks come in all shapes and sizes . Horton was definitely a large size . Handsome , if you like bulging muscles and wet red lips and fleshy cheeks . . . . " " Which you obviously do n't . Did he say anything  --  do anything  --  un-usual ? " " He did n't make a pass at me , if that 's what you mean . " Karen knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted Cheryl to ask . Was it possible that Mark . . . No , it would n't have occurred to him to worry about something like that . He was only concerned about the car.  |p75She  went on to tell Cheryl how Horton had reacted to her offer of a tip , adding , " Looking back on it , I realize why he was so amused , but I could n't possibly have anticipated what was going to happen . " " Of course not . " " Anyway , it 's no great tragedy . I 'm sure the car was insured . Mrs. Mac would really be upset if someone had been hurt , but fortunately that was n't the case . Would you let Alexander in , please , and we 'll decide where we 're going to go . " When Cheryl opened the door she saw the linens draping the clotheslinesin back , and offered to help bring them in . Two hours later they were still sitting in the kitchen eating crackers and cheese and talking clothes , and it was Karen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude . You must be starved . " " Not really . But you  --  " " I 'm trying to diet anyway . I 'm sure I can find something here  --  salad , tuna .... " " I could n't impose on you like that . " Karen smiled . " Cheryl , you do n't really want to go to a movie , do you ? " " Sure , if you do . " " There 's nothing around I want to see . " " And everyplace is so crowded on Saturday night . . . . " It 's such a pain getting dressed to go out . . . . " Karen could n't keep her face straight , and after a moment Cheryl grinned back at her , albeit somewhat shamefacedly . " I 'm so damned obvious . You knew all along I invited myself over here so I could play with your toys . " " Saturday night is a bad night to be alone , " Karen said , sobering . " You did me a favor . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anything fit to eat in the fridge . " Alexander approved of their staying home . He followed them upstairs of his own free will after supper and settled down in his velvet-lined bed . When Cheryl stooped to fondle his head he emitted a strange sound like a hoarse , magnified purr . " He 's a sweet little doggie , " Cheryl said . " He is not a sweet little doggie . But he seems to like you , for some reason . . . . Do n't get me wrong , that was n't an insult to you , but to Alexander . He hates everybody except Mrs. Mac . " " I expect he misses her . " " It 's hard to tell what Alexander thinks or feels . His manners seem to be improving slightly , though . Maybe a good swift kick now and then is what he needs . "  | " I 'm glad you have a dog , " Cheryl said . She glanced at the windows , now black with unrelieved night . Moon and stars had little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung over the city . " You are n't nervous here alone ? " " No.  --  " I did n't mean you should be . There 's nothing to be scared of , nothing at all  --  " " There 's plenty to be scared of , " Karen said bluntly . She began taking clothes out of the wardrobe , for she had promised Cheryl a fashion show of Mrs. MacDougal 's designer gowns . " Burglars and muggers and rapists and perverts . But that 's true of any big city , and if you spent all your time worrying about what might happen , you 'd never accomplish anything . " Cheryl , who had stretched out across the bed , rose up with a shriek . She was not disagreeing with Karen 's remarks , but reacting to the Schiaparelli Karen held . " Oh , Lord , it 's the most beautiful thing I ever saw ! Is that real mink ? " " Try it on , " Karen invited . " Could I ? Oh , no , I should n't . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded . The dress was too big for her , but as she pirouetted and turned in front of the mirror her face shone with delight . " I never in my life wore anything this classy , " she breathed . " I never expected I would . How much is it worth ? " " A thousand dollars , maybe more . A Vionnet sold at auction a few years ago for about eight thousand . " Cheryl 's eyes grew round as silver dollars . " Jee-sus ! Here , get it off me . " " Do n't be silly . Everything has to go to the cleaner before it 's sold ; they 've all been hanging in an attic for decades . Actually , " Karen added , " I 'm glad you inspired me to get these things out . According to the books I 've been reading , some of them should n't be on hangers . See here , on this Poiret , how the weight of the beaded skirt has pulled the threads loose . " " If you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Lying flat , and unfolded . They ought to be wrapped in cotton or acidfreepaper , because regular tissue contains chemicals that will eventually damage the fabric . I got out some old muslin sheets of Ruth 's  --  she saves everything !  --  to put around them , but I just have n't had time . " " Can I help ? Please ? " " Twist my arm , " Karen said , smiling . As they folded and wrapped the dresses , Cheryl said hesitantly , " I'mawfully dumb . I never heard of Vionnet or some of those other people . " She stumbled a little over the name . Karen did n't correct her . " I 'd neverheard of them either , until I started reading . Oh , I knew a few names  --  do n't ask me how , I guess if you like clothes you absorb some informationp77without realizing it . Worth , for instance ; he was the first of the great designers . An Englishman , surprisingly enough ; we think of haute couture as French . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his successors were French . Paul Poiret , Callot Soeurs  --  they really were sisters  --  and Jeanne Lanvin were among the first . Madeleine Vionnet was another great designerwho was n't really successful until the twenties , but she has been called the architect among dressmakers . ' Her clothes looked soft and flowing , but they were so cleverly constructed that they emphasized all the wearer 's good points and glossed over the defects . This is one of hers ; is n't it a lovely blue ? Supposedly the color was her own special discovery . " Much as she admired the designer clothes , it was the " whites " that pleased Cheryl most . " They 're more my kind of clothes . Simple cottons and crochet , like my grandma used to do . I do n't feel as if I was a bird in borrowed feathers . " " They look good on you , " Karen said , admiring the sleeveless camisole and full , ruffled petticoat Cheryl was modeling . " I think it 's because you have the right kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Cheryl , making a face . " The Edwardians would n't have put it that way . An hour-glass figure , madam , nicely rounded as a woman should be . Now I look ridiculous in clothes of that period . I 'm too tall and I 'm practically flat fore and aft , with no visible waistline . " " This is your style . " Cheryl held up a shimmering peach nightgown , cut low in front and clinging across the hips . " What do you call it ? " " It 's a bias-cut satin nightgown from the thirties . The Jean Harlow look . I might have been able to wear it once . . . . " " Try it on . Come on , you have to play too . " Karen had to tug the gown down over her hips , but it was something of a boost to her ego that she could get it on at all . " If I do n't breathe I 'm all right , " she said , sucking in her stomach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , lean and slinky . You know , you may have something with this idea of analyzing women 's figures according to historical periods . Maybe we  --  I mean , you  --  could start a fashion-guidance salon , like the color-analysis business . You know , winter , spring , fall , summer colors ? " " The world is full of opportunities , " Karen said ironically , peeling the nightgown cautiously over her head . Later , as she sat cross-legged on the bed watching Cheryl rummage through a box of odds and ends , she was still thinking about what she had said , and regretting her lapse into cynicism . Cheryl had not complained or asked for sympathy , and heaven knew she had a right . She had obviously been deeply in love , and to lose a young husband so unexpectedly , to findp78herself poor and untrained , with a child to support , was a much more difficult situation than Karen had to face . " Some of these things are awful dirty , " Cheryl remarked , still rummaging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired last night . I dropped a few off at the cleaners today , but I doubt he can do much with them . " " This would be real pretty if it was clean . " " Let 's see . " Cheryl tossed it to her  --  a lavender crepe-de-chine blouse with cap sleeves and a scalloped hem . " I 'll try washing it , " Karen said doubtfully . " Some silks wash in cold water and turn out well , but in this case the fabric is so worn it will probably tear . What 's that one ? " Cheryl straightened , holding a short jacket with leg-o ' - mutton sleeves and a high collar . The fabric was silk taffeta with tiny black-and-white checks , and a complex scrolled pattern of black braid edged the lapels and waistline . From top to bottom the entire garment was cut by parallel slashes . Only the stitching at the shoulder and around the hem held them in place ; they fluttered like strips of bunting as Cheryl lifted the garment . " That 's beyond repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pretty thing once . Shattered silk . " " Shattered ? It looks like it had been slashed by a knife . " Karen laughed . " Nothing so dramatic . It 's a condition you sometimes find in silks from around the turn of the century , when manufacturers used a finishing process to weight the fabric and improve its appearance . The substance contained metallic salts ; eventually they rotted the fabric , but only along the warp  --  hence the parallel tears . " " Ca n't it be repaired ? " " According to one of my books , there is no remedy . ' " " What a sad phrase ! " " It is , rather . True , though . Just toss it into the wastebasket . " " You 're going to throw it away ? " " Might as well . There is no remedy . ' " " Can I have it ? " " Why . . . Of course you can . Though what you are going to do with it -- - " " The trimming can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pensive expression . " The braid and the cute little buttons . " " You 're welcome to it . It 's of no use to me . " From Cheryl 's grateful thanks one would have thought she had had a Chanel gown bestowed upon her . She really does love these things , Karen thought.  | " I guess I 'd better get going , " Cheryl said reluctantly . " Mark said to call him when I was ready to leave . ... " She looked doubtfully at Karen , who said calmly , " That 's a good idea . It 's not easy to get a cab on Saturday night . " But the suggestion had cast a slight air of constraint , and when they went downstairs to wait for Mark , Cheryl was obviously ill at ease . " I do n't suppose you 'd be interested in going to an auction tomorrow , " she said . " An auction ? " " Yes , up in central Maryland . You mentioned you 'd have to start finding other sources of merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't suppose you want to . " Karen had not realized until that moment how much she had dreaded the long Sunday alone . " That sounds like fun . " Cheryl 's eyes lit up . " Does it really ? Would you really like to go ? I 'm crazy about auctions , but it 's not so much fun going alone . I 've been buying some things for Mark . You would n't believe the junk that boy has , and a man in his position needs classy furniture , do n't you think ? And I 've seen old clothes  --  what do you call them , vintage ?  --  at auctions , and you said you 'd be needing jewelry and other things too . . . . Oh , that 's great . I hate Sundays , there 's nothing to do except study , and I 've already done my next assignment . I 'll see if Mark needs the car . " " I have a car . It 's my uncle 's , actually ; he made me get a D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he 's gone . I 've only driven it once since he left , so I guess I ought to take it out again . " " That 's good , because then we can stay as long as we want . I know how to get there . I made Mark take me once , but he hates auctions . " " I 'll pick you up , " Karen said slowly . She had just realized what she had gotten herself into by admitting she had a car . " You do n't have to do that . " Cheryl 's exuberant grin faded . " I 'm being pushy again , " she muttered . " I should have waited for you to call me , I 'm always the one who . . . But I thought maybe you did n't like . . . I do n't know what happened with you and Mark , he never said , honest he did n't , but I wondered . . . So that 's why I keep inviting you all the time . " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no difficulty in following Cheryl 's train of thought . She laughed lightly . " I do n't know why you should think I want to avoid Mark . We were . . . we were good friends once , but that was a long time ago . My feelings toward him are . . . are perfectly amiable . Casual , but  --  er  --  amiable . " " Really ? " " Really . What time tomorrow ? "  | " We ought to leave early so we can be there when it starts . But you do n't have to come get me , it will save time if I take a cab here , then we can get right onto the parkway . Suppose I come at eight . Is that too early ? " " No , that 's fine . " " There 's Mark . I 'd better run . I hope they have some old clothes ! But even if they do n't , it will be good practice for you , bidding and all that . You have to be very sly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sight she wanted to see . She stood watching as Cheryl got into the waiting car . Mark did n't get out , or wave . I got more attention from Horton , Karen thought wryly . But of course Mark 's windows were closed because of the air-conditioning . The night air was hazy with mist and close as a steam bath . He did sound the horn , though , as he drove off  --  a familiar syncopated signal that sent a stab of memory along Karen 's nerves . A lurid pinkish glow lit the sky . Faintly to her ears came the sounds of revelry by night  --  isolated shrieks of laughter , the beat of music , the throb of automobile engines . As usual , every legal parking space along the street was filled . People were more cautious about parking illegally these days ; the District police did n't fool around , they booted or towed violators instead of issuing meaningless tickets . Shadows passed along the sidewalk ; people hurrying to and from the night spots on Wisconsin , residents walkingdogs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing to be nervous about . She went back in and followed Alexander through his nightly routine  --  the final trip to the comfort station in the back yard , and the reward for good behavior , a gourmet dog biscuit . He did n't linger over his outdoor activities , and Karen was glad to close the door against the shrouded night . There were lights outside the back door , but they did not extend far into the darkness . She handed over the biscuit and then dropped her hand onto the dog 's head in a brief caress . " No squirrels out there tonight , Alexander ? Let 's hit the sack , okay ? "  |p81KAREN  cut her jogging short next morning , but Cheryl was early and she was still rummaging through her clothes trying to decide what to wear when the doorbell rang . She had no idea what constituted proper attire for a country auction ; presumably pearls and mink were not appropriate , which was just as well , because she possessed neither . Except , of course , for the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Schiaparelli gown . She ran downstairs to admit Cheryl and apologize for being late . When she explained her dilemma about what to wear , Cheryl looked surprised . " The coolest thing you 've got . It 's already pushing eighty degrees . And comfortable shoes . " She was wearing sneakers almost as battered as Karen 's , and her legs were bare . A sleeveless white blouse and a dirndl skirt almost old enough to qualify as vintage completed her costume , and as Karen dashed back upstairs to finish dressing she thought how relaxing it was to be with someone who dressed for comfort instead of style  --  and who would n't make malicious remarks about how other people looked . When she came back down , Cheryl was sitting on the stairs talking to Alexander , who sat with his fuzzy head tilted to one side as if listening . " I 'm sorry , I did n't even offer you a cup of coffee , " Karen said . " No time ; we 'd better get going if we want to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightweight stools or lawn chairs ? This place does n't have seating , and it could be a long day . " Carrying the chairs , they walked to the garage where Pat kept his car , several blocks from the house . " Wow , " Cheryl said admiringly . " What a car ! It 's a Porsche , is n't it ? " " Yes . The MacDougals have a weakness for fancy automobiles . Frankly , I hate sports cars , I always feel as if I 'm sitting right smack on the pavement , and trucks look like cliffs . Can you squeeze in , or shall I back out ? " " No problem . There 's not much trunk space , is there ? I hope we do n't fall in love with anything bigger than a breadbox today . I suppose you 'll be getting a station wagon , or a van ? " " Oh , Lord , that 's another problem I had n't considered . " Karen eased the car carefully out of the garage . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself , I 'm so damned disorganized . . . . " " Nobody who was disorganized could do those things you did for your husband  --  taking notes and reading all those books . " " I did n't do anything a halfway competent secretary could n't do . And according to Jack , I did n't do it very well . Do I turn right or left at M Street ? " Cheryl gave her a peculiar look but said only , " Right . Then straight on. , , Traffic patterns had changed in the past ten years and Karen was a little nervous about Pat 's valuable car . Not until she had left the Washington Beltway and was heading north on 270 did she really relax . " The worst is over , " Cheryl said encouragingly . " You 're a good driver . " " That kid in the pickup did n't think so . What was it he said ? " " Do n't ask . He was drunk anyhow . " " This car is Pat 's baby , " Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . And I have n't done much city driving lately . Jack always . . . " She fell silent ; she had determined she was n't going to say anything that could be interpreted as a complaint or a demand for sympathy . After a moment Cheryl said , " I had the same problem . " " You did ? " " Sure . The trouble with being married is that you let the other guy do so many things . You share . Then , when you 're alone . . . I suppose it 's just as hard for men . They feel as helpless about cooking and cleaning as we do when we have to fix a leaky faucet or put oil in the car . " " Help , " Karen said . " Do n't remind me of all the things I ca n't do ! I do n't think I 've ever put oil in the car . " " I 'll show you , it 's easy . The only thing to remember , " Cheryl saidp83solemnly , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole the dipstick is in . " Dipstick ? " " I 'll show you that too . " Cheryl grinned , then sobered again . " There were times when I thought it would n't be the big tragedy that defeated me , but the constant little aggravations , day after day . At least you can learn to handle the little things . You ca n't fix a broken heart or a broken spirit so easy . . . . The next exit is ours . " Though they were in good time , with a quarter of an hour to go before the auction was to begin , there were already cars parked on both sides of the narrow road leading to a graveled lot next to a low , sprawling building . A man directed them into a field , and Karen guided the car over bumps and humps to the end of a row of other vehicles . She gritted her teeth and prayed for Pat 's muffler ; the field had been roughly mowed , but not leveled . " Looks like a big crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are two kinds of people here , " Cheryl explained . " Dealers like you  --  this is their business , after all  --  and people who just get a kick out of attending auctions . " Karen felt a small thrill at the matter-of-fact tone in which Cheryl had said " dealers like you . " It was , however , partly a shudder of trepidation . " I do n't know what I 'm doing , " she groaned . " Well , you have some idea of what things are worth , " Cheryl said . " What prices you can ask , I mean . You just figure out how much you can afford to spend and do n't go over that amount when you bid . " " It ca n't be as simple as that . " " Just about . " Cheryl gave a wriggle of pleasure . " This is such fun . I 'm one of the second group . If I did n't have other things to do , I 'd be at an auction or flea market or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to display her knowledge , Cheryl explained the arrangements . The auction building , open on one side , containedthe choicer items that were to be sold . The auctioneer 's podium , at the front , was flanked by long tables piled with small items  --  glasses and china , clocks and lamps , linens and ornaments . Furniture was stacked around the perimeter , leaving the center open for the bidders . This space was already half-filled with portable chairs , some occupied , some empty . They set up their own chairs in a strategic spot and then Cheryl led Karen outside . Here the less valuable merchandise was arranged in parallellines . It was a motley , shabby collection  --  chairs with no seats , tables with no finish , chests of drawers with half the drawers missing , rusty tools and pieces of machinery , and dozens upon dozens of cardboard cartons filled with everything from books to empty jelly jars.  | " This is just junk , " Karen exclaimed . " Junk to you , treasure trove to people who are willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll be starting soon , probably with these box lots . I want to have a look at the linens . You never know . . . . " That phrase , Karen soon realized , was the bidder 's creed . You never knew what might have been overlooked by a busy auctioneer or an ignorantseller . Among the dime-store ornaments might be a Sevres saucer ; a hand-knit cotton-warp bedspread could be hidden under piles of motheatenblankets . Watching Cheryl as she squatted and rummaged , her skirts trailing in the dust , Karen began to get the urge too . When the auctioneer 's voice rose over the hubbub , announcing the sale was about to begin , Cheryl rose to her feet and dusted off her hands . " We 'd better get our numbers . There 's nothing here you want , is there ? " Karen agreed that there was not . The most exciting thing Cheryl had turned up was a set of kitchen towels embroidered with puppies in strident shades of green and red . They stood in line to register . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , Karen was issued a piece of cardboard with a number scrawled on it . The process struck her as extremely casual , but when she said as much to Cheryl , the latter shrugged . " I guess the big expensive places ask for bank references and like that , but there is n't a lot of money involved in these small auctions . If you pass a bad check , the word gets around and then you ca n't play anymore . They do n't usually take out-of-state checks , though , so it 's lucky you have a local driver 's license . The District is considered local , here and in Virginia . What you really ought to get is a dealer 's number , then you would n't have to pay state sales tax . " Karen rolled her eyes and threw up her hands at the reminder of anotherchore to be done , and Cheryl laughed self-consciously . " There I go again . Why do n't you just tell me to shut up when I butt into your busi-ness ? " They returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up considerablyin both senses of the word . A crowd surrounded the auctioneer ; they attached themselves to the fringes . At first Karen found the proceedings confusing . Microphone in hand , the auctioneer , a tall , rawboned man wearing a Western-style straw hat moved slowly down the line of merchandise . Sometimes one of his assistantsheld up the item being auctioned , but Karen was not always sure precisely what was about to be sold , and the bidding went with terrifying speed  --  or so it seemed to her . She had never attended an auction before . It was a popular avocation with some faculty wives , but she had never had time for such things . There was always a paper to be typed or a set ofp85references to check , and besides , Jack despised secondhand merchandise . He did n't even like antiques , only neat , clean reproductions . " Here 's a nice lot , folks , " the auctioneer drawled as his assistant lifted a cardboard carton . " Sheets , towels , hardly used . Who 'll start it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " The bidding started at two dollars and went up by fifty-cent increments . " That was a good buy , " Cheryl said , as the box was finally knocked down for eight dollars . " But it 's early yet , the crowd is just getting started . " " Good buy ? Who wants sheets other people have used ? " " You sleep on ' em all the time in hotels , " Cheryl said practically . " Do you know how much new sheets cost , even on sale ? How 're you doing  --  getting the hang of it ? " " I need to scratch my chin , " Karen said nervously . " But I 'm afraid to move . Some of these people seem to bid by raising an eyebrow , or wrigglingtheir ears . " Cheryl grinned . " No problem . Fred 's a good auctioneer ; he knows a serious bidder from a nervous twitcher . Just hold up your card when you want to bid . But watch out for auction fever . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want and do n't need . " " Why would anybody do that ? " " It 's like a disease , " Cheryl said seriously . " It still happens to me sometimes ; comes on without warning . You find yourself going higher and , higher and you ca n't seem to stop . If you see me doing it , just take my card away from me and do n't let me have it back , even if I beg . " Karen laughed , thinking she was joking . Nothing like that would ever affect her ! She decided , though , that she would rather accept some unwantedarticle than admit she had made a gesture in error ; many of the , bidders were known to the auctioneer , and he interspersed his droning spiel with jokes and friendly insults . " Sam , if you do n't want the stuff , stop waving your hat ; I do n't care if the flies are driving you crazy . Lady , you 're raising your own bid ; it 's okay by me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheryl bought a box of bedding for six dollars , and Karen regretted her earlier snobbish comment . The sheets were n't for Mark 's expensive town house ; they were for the home Cheryl hoped to establish for herself and her little boy . The sun rose higher and the complexions of the bidders turned pink and shiny with sweat . A few people left , having attained their hearts ' desires or lost them to higher bidders , but the crowd increased as late-corners arrived . The auctioneer turned his mike over to a colleague and retired into the shade.  |p86Karen  was about to suggest that they emulate him when the attack Cheryl had warned her of occurred . It came on her with the suddenness of ' a sharp pang of indigestion , when a box of odds and ends was about to be knocked down for two dollars . Before she knew what she was doing , she was waving her cardboard ticket high above her head . " Two-fifty , " the auctioneer droned . " Do I hear three bucks ? " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing in the box except two rusty license plates and a red plaster dog with a chipped ear . The auctioneer 's assistant deposited the box at Karen 's feet , and Cheryl giggled . " What did you do that for ? " " I do n't know , " Karen admitted . She and Cheryl contemplated the red plaster dog . " A rare example of antique folk art , " said Cheryl . The two exchanged glances and dissolved into laughter . " I warned you , " Cheryl gasped , wiping her eyes . " Give me your card . " " No , no . I 'm all right now , " Karen assured her , clutching the magic ticket . " I wo n't do it again , I promise . " When the auctioneer started on the last row of decrepit furniture , Cheryl glanced at her watch . " Let 's get something to eat and check out the things inside . It should take him about half an hour to finish this lot . " " No , wait a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much he gets for that old rusty stove . " " No , you do n't . Are n't you hungry ? " " No . I just might be able to use that  --  " " Karen ! " " Oh , all right , " Karen grumbled , and let herself be led away . Karen was glad she had a knowledgeable companion ; she would not have thought to bring something to sit on , and now that her fit of auction fever was subsiding she realized her legs were wobbly with weariness . They found their chairs and Karen collapsed with a sigh . " I should have told you to bring a hat , " Cheryl said , looking anxiously at Karen 's flushed face . " I 'm fine . Just let me sit a minute . " " You stay there , I 'll get us something to drink . " She returned with cold drinks and sandwiches and two pieces of cake . Karen decided to forget about her diet ; the cake was homemade and delicious . Refreshed and revived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables at the front of the shed , followed by an amused Cheryl . Karen was tempted to linger over the dishes and glassware . Some of the pieces , especially the hand-painted Bavarian and Austrian bowls , were quite charming . However , after having watched Julie sell a single goblet for three hundred dollars and another that looked identical for twenty-five ,  |p87She  had decided she would not deal in such items . She simply did n't know Slough about them , and she could n't become an expert in every field of antiques . One table was piled with linens and quilts . The choicer of these items were displayed on wooden racks , arid Karen reached a covetous hand toward an appliqued quilt , each square of which had a different pattern . " That 's an album quilt , " Cheryl said . " The squares were made by differentfriends  --  " " I know , Julie had one . She sells these things for five and six hundred Collars . If I could get it for two hundred  --  " " You wo n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a searching scrutiny . Karen stared at her . She was a pleasant-faced person , about Karen 's age , with brown hair pulled back into a ponytail and laughter lines around ber mouth ; but Karen 's viewpoint had changed . All other bidders were low potential rivals , and she was prepared to dislike each and every one of them . " Are you going to bid ? " she asked suspiciously . I " Probably . But I wo n't get it either . See that gal over there ? " A flick of I'er thumb indicated a tall , white-haired woman dressed elegantly andcongruously in a knit dress , hose , and heels . " That 's Liz Nafziger . She 's of more money than God , and she collects linens and quilts . She can topy offer I could make , because I have to make my profit . " " You 're a dealer ? " Karen asked . The woman nodded . " I have a shop in Harper 's Ferry . Quilts , coverlets , old lace , vintage clothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cheryl said proudly . " She specializes in vintage . " " Oh ? " The other woman 's smile faded ; she and Karen studied one anotherwarily . " Where 's your shop ? " " I do n't have one yet , " Karen admitted . " I 'm just starting . To be honest , I do n't know what I 'm doing . " " Sisters under the skin . " The other woman held out a tanned dusty hand . " Helen Johnson . " Karen introduced herself and Cheryl . " I do n't want to bid against you , " she began . " Boy , do you have a lot to learn , " Helen said bluntly . " You bid against anybody and everybody , dear , and the devil take the hindmost . Do n't bid against Liz , though , unless you want to run the price up just for spite . And speaking of spite , there 's one you want to watch out for  --  see that fat little dumpling with the rosy cheeks and the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll rearrange the boxes while you are n't looking . "  | " I do n't understand . " Helen nudged the cardboard cartons under the table with her sandaled toe . " Well , suppose you scrounge around in these boxes and find something you 'd like to have . You 're bidding on the whole lot , but that one piece makes it worthwhile . So when your box comes up , you bid , and you get it cheap , and you think , hip hip hurrah  --  until you take a closer look and discover the one item you wanted is n't there . By a strange coincidence it happened to work its way into the box Margie just bought . " " It 's very nice of you to tell me these things , " Karen said humbly . " You 'll find it pays to stay on good terms with your colleagues in crime , " Helen said . " We can help each other out now and then because we are n't competing , in the usual sense ; our merchandise is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a particular style or size I do n't have , I 'll send her on to you , and you do the same for me . If a check bounces on you , you warn me , and vice versa . Once you acquire a reputationfor square dealing , people will be more likely to deal fairly with you . Do n't expect any special favors , though , " she added with a smile . " Not even from me . " " But does n't it make sense for dealers to agree beforehand not to bid against each other  --  taking turns on the items they all want ? " Helen tried to look shocked . " Why , Karen , that 's considered unethical , if not downright immoral . " The amusement she had attempted to suppress surfaced in an unexpected dimple ; grinning , she added , " I 'm sure you would n't dream of doing such a thing , any more than I would . At least you should n't discuss it aloud . " She turned with apparent casualness to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle by inquiring buyers . Helen 's tanned , capable hands sorted swiftly through them . " Nothing here , " she announced . " Actually , I seldom buy at auctions . The merchandise is usually in terrible condition . " " Where do you get your stock ? " Karen asked innocently . Helen moved on to another pile of fabrics without answering . Karen was about to repeat the question when Cheryl nudged her . " Would you tell other dealers about your sources ? " she whispered . " Oh , " Karen whispered back . There were a few old dresses and bits of wearing apparel in the pile Helen was examining . One caught Karen 's eye , and after Helen had tossed it aside she picked it up . It was a dress made of ivory silk , the body unfitted , the modest neckline bordered with lace . A deep flounce of lace trimmed the hem , and rows of pearls , some of them missing , edged the neck and hipline . The rottedp89remains of a silk flower clung horribly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How pretty , " said the romantic Cheryl , seeing the dress as it had once been , not as it was now . " What period is it , Karen ? " Karen glanced at Helen . " Late twenties or early thirties , I think , " she said timidly . Helen nodded . " It 's in terrible condition . The lace is hopelessly rotted and most of the beads are gone . " " But the fabric of the dress is in good shape , " Cheryl said . She was right ; there were not even perspiration stains , which , as Karen had learned , made a silk garment useless to a dealer . Perspiration rotted silk and left a stain that no cleaner could remove . " It 's a wedding dress , " she said . Cheryl laughed . " She must have got married in January , in an unheated church . Or else she was the calmest bride in recorded history . " " But who would sell her wedding dress , or her mother 's ? " Karen asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; honestly , it 's enough to make you a cynic about marriage . " " It was mine , " said a voice behind them . An arm reached out and seized the dress . The arm belonged to an elderly woman wearing a cotton house dress and faded sneakers . Her lined , deeply tanned face was bare of make-up and her hair had been pulled back into a tight , ugly bun . Her eyes , deep-set under bushy gray brows , fixed on the dress with strange intensity . " Mine , " she repeated in a crooning voice . " I wore it in 1931 . I was seventeen years old . Henry was thirty-eight . Quite a catch , Henry was . A member of the legal profession , from a fine old family . I poisoned him in 1965 . " With no change of tone or expression she tossed the dress onto the table and stalked away . " What did she say ? " Karen gasped . Helen chuckled . " Mrs. Grossmuller is a little . . . " She twirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really poison him , did she ? " Cheryl asked , fascinated . " Who knows ? He was a judge , and reputedly one of the meanest bastardsin the state . Mrs. G. was never arrested , anyhow . " Helen wandered off , with a casual flip of her hand . The shed was filling up and the auctioneer came in to start the sale . As Karen had expected , Helen bid on the wedding dress . So did Mrs. Grossmuller . She started the bidding at " two bits " and kept repeating the same amount in a stentorian voice , which the auctioneer blandly ignored . He knocked the dress down to Karen for twenty-five dollars . She knew shep90could replace the rotted lace from pieces in Mrs. Ferris ' collection . Repairedand restored , the dress would probably sell for two hundred dollars or more . Vintage wedding dresses were popular with young brides who went in for the nostalgic look . She bought a few other garments and had to be forcibly restrained from bidding on a Bavarian chocolate set to which she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least as high as anything Julie would have asked . Helen had been right about the album quilt ; the collector she had pointed out bought it for $675 . It was late afternoon before Karen and Cheryl decided there was nothing else they wanted . They paid for their purchases and gathered up their belongings . As they left the building , Helen Johnson raised a beckoning hand , and they stopped to speak with her . " Here 's my card , " she said , handing it to Karen . " Come by or give me a call sometime . " " That 's very kind of you , " Karen said . Helen shrugged . " As I said , we can sometimes give one another a helpinghand . " " I do n't have a card yet . " Karen dug in her purse , found paper and pencil . " Here 's my address and phone number . . . . Thanks a lot , Helen . " " Do n't thank me till I do something for you . Oh-oh , here comes Mrs. Grossmuller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard that story about her poisoning dear Henry too many times . " She glided gracefully out of the danger zone , but Karen , trying to pick up the chairs and clothing she had set down when she wrote her address for Helen , was fairly caught . " Changed my mind , " Mrs. Grossmuller announced . " I do n't want to sell my dress . Give you two bits for it . " " But I paid twenty-five dollars , " Karen protested . She expected a scene and was not looking forward to an argument with the old woman who was , despite her age , heavy-set and formidable-looking . To her relief and surprise , Mrs. Grossmuller suddenly changed her mind . " Oh , well , that 's all right then . You might 's well have it as anyone . What did you say your name was ? " Somewhat reluctantly , Karen told her . " How do you do , " said Mrs. Grossmuller , in an abrupt change to stateliness . " I am Mrs. Henry Grossmuller . Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1965 . " Mrs. Grossmuller trailed them to their car , chatting amiably . Except for occasional references to the murder of her husband , her conversation was perfectly lucid until Karen and Cheryl were in the car and Karen hadp91started the engine . Then Mrs. Grossmuller thrust her head in the open window and grinned fiendishly at Karen . " Twenty-five dollars , eh ? Thank you , my dear , I admit the money will not be unwelcome . But you 're loony , you know ; the dress is n't worth two bits . " The last they saw of her she was wandering down the line of parked cars . " You do n't suppose she 's driving , do you ? " Cheryl exclaimed . " How else could she get here ? " Karen steered carefully across the bumpy field . " Just because she has a little bee in her bonnet does n't mean she 's incompetent . " " So you say , " Cheryl remarked skeptically . " One thing about this business , Karen : you sure meet some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country inn , to avoid a sudden thunderstormthat rumbled through , turning the road into a shallow , running stream . Karen felt self-conscious about entering a restaurant in her sweatstained , rumpled clothes , but when Cheryl explained to the hostess that they had been auctioning all day , the woman nodded understandingly . " Fred Behm 's ? Hear he had a good crowd . Hope you were lucky . " They shared a half carafe of wine in the low-ceilinged , candlelit dining room and Karen found herself talking about things she had n't even told Ruth . Cheryl did not need wine to loosen her tongue ; she talked to everybody , including the waitress , in a way that would have left Jack in a state of horrified disgust . The conversation bore useful fruit ; the waitress knew of a place in Woodsboro that might be for rent , all fixed up ; it had been a craft shop . She also knew Mrs. Grossmuller . " Poor old soul , she 's a little strange . Not crazy nor nothing , she can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange . They say she 's got millions stashed away , but the way she acts you 'd think she was dirt poor . Want your coffee now or later ? " " I like places like this , " Cheryl announced . " People are so friendly . Not like Washington . " She admitted she missed her friends back home . Some of the people she had met through Mark were nice enough , but they were n't interested in the things she cared about . Karen sympathized ; but when she hinted that Mark should not have forced such an incompatible role on his sister , Cheryl was quick to defend him.  | " He does n't make me do anything I do n't want to do . I never go to those really formal parties with him ; I do n't know the right way to act , and I 'd just embarrass him . But I owe him so much , and I like to do everything I can to help him . " " I 'm surprised you do n't want to rush back tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretted her sarcastic tone as soon as she spoke , but Cheryl appeared not to notice it . " Listen , I 'm in no hurry to get back , believe me . Tonight is the Murder Club , and those guys  --  " " The what ? " Cheryl giggled . " That 's what I call it . It 's just Mark and a buddy of his sitting around drinking beer and arguing . They argue about everything under the sun , actually , but Tony is a cop  --  a detective  --  and he 's interested in crime . " " I suppose he would be , " Karen agreed . " But is n't that rather a busman 's holiday for him ? I 'd think he would get enough of crime at work . " " Yeah , you would , would n't you ? But the cases they discuss are old ones  --  classic unsolved crimes , Tony calls them . One time I remember they spent the whole night arguing about some king of England who murdered his two little nephews . Only Mark said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I guess so . That 's right , you know all about history . " Cheryl looked at her respectfully . " It was all Greek to me . But you know , some of them are kind of interesting . I 'm real squeamish  --  I never would go hunting with Joe , even though I am a damned good shot  --  but there 's something about those old cases , they happened such a long time ago they do n't seem real . More like a book . " " So Mark thinks Richard the Third was innocent , " Karen said , amused . " Oh , you know Mark , he 'll argue about anything . He takes the opposite side just to get Tony mad . There was one time when they had a big fight about something that happened back in the I850s  --  the Bell Witch , I think it was  --  " " Witch ? That 's not crime , that 's pure superstition . " " Sure , you know that and I know that  --  and Mark knows it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony says everything has a rational explanation , and when Mark starts talking about poltergeists and haunted houses , he just about blows his stack . " " I think I 'd like Tony . " " You 'll have to meet him . He 's a nice guy . " " But not when the Murder Club is in session . I ca n't imagine how anyone could find that sort of thing entertaining . "  | " Really ? I could n't help noticing that book on your bedside table . . . . " At first Karen could n't imagine what Cheryl was talking about . " Oh , the Georgetown legends book , " she exclaimed . " Julie foisted that off on me the other day ; either she hoped it would give me nightmares , or she expected the story about Mrs. MacDougal would upset me . " " Swell friend , " Cheryl said . " Do n't tell me Mrs. MacDougal has a ghost . But I guess if there was such a thing , it would hang out in a house like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was an old scandal , " Karen said distastefully . " Fifty years old . According to the book , some idiot shot himself in Mrs. Mac 's billiard room  --  killed himself for love of her . " Cheryl grinned and quickly sobered . " I 'm sorry ! But it sounds so silly when you put it that way . " " It sounds pretty silly any way you put it , " Karen agreed . " But you 're right about the deadening effect of time ; it 's impossible to get emotionally involved in something that happened so long ago . " " You would n't say that if you could hear Tony and Mark arguing about that King Richard , " Cheryl said darkly . The storm had passed by the time they left the restaurant . There was little traffic on the quiet country road , and they drove in companionable silence for a while as stars blossomed in the darkening west . Then Cheryl , who had been stroking the soft silk of the old wedding dress , said dreamily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but I really do admire you , Karen . " " I 'll be older than Mrs. Mac before I get tired of hearing that . But if you 're referring to my business plans , such as they are , I have n't done anything worthy of admiration ; it was pure good luck and the good will of friends that got me started . " " But it 's such a fascinating business . The old dresses and underwear  --  excuse me , lingerie  --  it 's as if they were alive , you know ? They have historiesjust the way people do . " " To me they 're just merchandise , " Karen said , touching the brake as a pair of bright circles reflected her headlights . The rabbit prudently withdrewinto the brush at the side of the road . " Watch out for  --  oh , good , you saw him . You ca n't mean that ; you have lots of imagination . Like this wedding dress . Ca n't you picture that poor girl , barely seventeen , standing there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was marrying a man she feared and hated .... " " What a romantic you are , " Karen said amiably . " Just because the lucky lady did n't perspire  --  " " She hated him , " Cheryl insisted . " I know she did . "  |p94Karen  was silent . Cheryl nudged her . " You 're thinking about something . I can practically hear you thinking . What ? " " I was remembering something that happened last week , " Karen admitted . " A girl came in and wanted to try on the flapper dress I had in the window . Light-pink chiffon with sequins and crystal beads . It fit her well  --  she was one of those skinny little things , practically anorexic  --  but she barely had it over her head before she began trying to tear it off . I could have killed her ; you ca n't be rough with clothes like that , they 're too old and fragile . I said something rude  --  well , not really screaming rude , cold and nasty . She stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead fish , and said , Ca n't you feel the vibes ? Something awful happened to the woman who wore that dress ! I would n't have it if you gave it to me . ' " " Geez , " said Cheryl , impressed . " I thought she was just being dramatic . And , " Karen added firmly , " I still think so . " " Oh , right . I was n't trying to suggest there was anything spooky about it . Like Tony says , everything has a rational explanation . The way I feel about this dress comes from meeting Mrs. Grossmuller and hearing her talk about  --  about her husband . But the clothes themselves can give you clues about the people they belonged to , ca n't they ? Suppose the seams are all pulled and stretched ; you figure the woman was either too poor to buy a new dress after she gained weight or too vain to admit she needed a bigger size . " " Clothes are historical artifacts , like pottery and tools , " Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they actually touched and were shaped by the people who wore them . A historian can learn a great deal about a culture from costume  --  not only the bare facts of fashion , but the social and political attitudes of the period . The clothing women wore in the late nineteenth century directly reflects their status ; tight corsets and heavy , cumbersome fabrics and long skirts prevented the wearers from engaging in any useful activity whatever . " " You sure know a lot of fancy words , " Cheryl said . Her voice was noncommittal , and in the darkness Karen could not see her face . " I did n't mean , " she began . " Oh , hey , I like it . " After a moment Cheryl added , " You do n't talk down to me . I appreciate that . " Karen decided to park on the street that night rather than carry their purchases all the way from the garage . She had to drive around the block several times before she found a legal parking space . Except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies were dark ; the streetlights sent shimmering reflection across the wet pavement.  |p95Karen  had not expected they would be so late , and she had neglected to leave any lights burning . As they felt their way carefully along the short stretch of sidewalk between the gate and the steps , the carton Cheryl carried slipped from her arms , spilling the contents onto the ground . " Damn , " Cheryl said . " Oh well , they needed washing anyway . Do n't try to help me , Karen , you 've got your arms full . How about turning on some lights so I can see what I 'm doing ? " Karen ran up the steps , trying to find her key without losing her grip on the chairs and the armful of clothes . Cheryl was still crawling under the boxwood that lined the walk when Karen opened the door and stepped into the darkened hall . Before she could reach for the light switch , something grabbed her . The attack was so unexpected that pure shock froze her for an instant  --  time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat and close around it . The door slammed shut with a crash like a rifle shot , and from somewhere in the house came the frenzied , muffled barking of a dog . Those sounds , and the thick hoarse voice whispering were all she heard before the roaring of the blood in her ears drowned out sound altogether . Light dazzled her eyes when she forced them open . She was lying on her back staring up at the chandelier in the hall . No one else was there except Alexander . He was sitting a few feet from her , and although his eyes were invisible as usual , she deduced from his alert pose that he was staring at her . As she turned her head he let out a sharp peremptory bark and went trotting off . Running footsteps heralded the arrival of Cheryl , breathless and pale . She knelt beside Karen . " He got away , dammit ! Are you all right ? Just lie still . I called the police ; they should be here any minute . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm all right . Help me get up . " With Cheryl 's assistance she staggered into the parlor and dropped onto the sofa . Cheryl peered anxiously at her . " How about a cup of tea ? " " How about a stiff drink ? " said Karen . " Right . " Cheryl went in search of refreshment and Karen rearranged her skirt , and her scattered thoughts . Physically she was not in bad shape . A lump on the back of her head and a sore spot on her throat seemed to be the extent of the damage . But for some reason she could n't stop shaking . The sight of Alexander wandering nonchalantly around the room infuriatedher . Cheryl came back with a glass in each hand . " I could do with a littlep96something myself , " she announced . " But I 'm not so sure about you . How many fingers am I holding up ? " " None . You 've got all ten of them wrapped around those glasses . I do n't have a concussion , Cheryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing wrong with me except  --  except . . . " Shock , " Cheryl said gently , steadying her shaking hand . " Here . Take it slow . " She had brought brandy  --  the conventional remedy for swooning females . Karen hated brandy , but she did n't say so . The beverage lived up to its reputation ; after a few sips her hands stopped quivering . She let Cheryl take the glass and then leaned back against the cushions . The color had returned to Cheryl 's face ; she had been as white as a bleached petticoat . Sipping her own brandy , she said , " We 're going to make a great impression on the cops , both stinking of alcohol . " " Do n't expect the cops to show up for a while . The weekend revelers are winding up their celebrations , and a little old break-in is n't going to impressthe boys in blue . " However , it was not long before there was a vigorous pounding on the front door and Karen said in surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cheryl rose slowly . " I think maybe , " she began . " Oh , wait . Where 's Alexander ? " " In the kitchen , I guess . Karen , I guess I should tell you  --  " " You had better let them in before they kick the door down . I had n't expected such zeal . " As she should have known , from the vehemence of the knocking and from Cheryl 's hesitation , it was not the police . Naturally , she would call Mark , as well as the cops , Karen thought . He 's her brother , after all . There was another man with Mark , a muscular youngish man whose Hispanic ancestry showed in his olive complexion and opaque dark eyes . He was almost too handsome to be believable ; one expected to see a makeupperson hovering , and hear a director shout , " Ready for Take 2 . " A heavy mustache only partially concealed his delicate , finely cut lips . Like Mark , he was wearing jeans and a short-sleeved shirt open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dapper as the male model he resembled . Mark had not shaved that day and his shirt was streaked with stains . Beer stains , Karen thought , remembering Mark 's habit of using a beer can as a baton , waving it in the air to orchestrate his arguments , banging it on the table to emphasize a point . He was always very apologetic when it splashed on the furniture and people 's clothes . . . . No one spoke for a few seconds . Then , with an irritated glance at hisp97silent , staring companion , the dark man smiled in an embarrassed fashion . " I 'm Tony Cardoza  --  " Karen was still shaky and disoriented . " You ca n't be . Tony the cop ? Tony the rationalist ? Tony who spends his spare time arguing about old murders ? " Cardoza 's smile faltered , and Mark found his voice . " What 's the matter with you , Karen ? " His eyes moved to the two glasses side by side on the coffee table and his eyebrows rose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never did have any head for liquor  --  damn it , Cheryl , do n't you know better than to give alcohol to an injured person ? She could be concussed , or  --  or  --  " Karen interrupted with a yell . " Watch out ! Cheryl  --  grab him  --  " It was too late . Alexander had only hesitated for a moment because he could not decide whom to bite first . His leap was one of his best ever . He caught Mark square in the calf and hung there , slobbering and growling , while Cardoza stared and Mark swore and Cheryl burst into a peal of slightly hysterical laughter . The police arrived shortly thereafter . Cheryl carried Alexander away in disgrace , and although Cardoza identified himself to the patrolmen , he effaced himself thereafter , following Cheryl to the kitchen . Mark sat stiff and scowling , his arms folded , while an officer took down Karen 's statement . The dignity of his demeanor was only slightly marred by his scruffy cheeks and chin and by the loose flap of denim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement did n't take long . There was little Karen could add to the bare facts : " I walked in the door and somebody grabbed me by the throat . " Mark followed the policemen out . He had not spoken to Karen since his initial outburst . Left alone , she drowsed off , and did not awaken until she heard Cheryl say softly , " Poor baby , she 's worn out . I 'm going to put her to bed . Mark , could you  --  " Karen 's eyes popped open . " I do n't need to be carried . Mark , if you dare  --  I 'm too heavy  --  " " That 's okay , I 've been working out . " His smile recalled an old , almost forgotten joke between them . His slim build and lack of inches had caused a lot of people , including Karen herself initially , to underestimate his wiry strength . In spite of herself , her stiff lip curved in an answering smile . But she stiffened again when his arms lifted her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relax , will you ? I 'm not about to take unfair advantage of you , not with a cop right at my elbow . . . . " " I  --  uh , " said Cardoza . " I guess I 'll be running along . "  | " Please do n't , " Karen murmured . " I mean  --  I 'd like to talk to you , about what happened . " Mark started up the stairs , moving as lightly as if he were carrying an empty dress . Karen could feel the hard muscles under his thin shirt , but for all the emotion he displayed he might as well have been carrying an empty dress . Why did I do that ? Karen thought wretchedly  --  and then , with a spurt of anger , And why does he have to be so supersensitive ? " I 'm not even here officially , " Cardoza protested . He was still at the foot of the stairs , still talking , when Mark carried Karen into her room . Her shriek brought him bounding up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ! " Karen cried . " Look what he did ! All my things  --  all over  --  I spent hours washing and ironing  --  " " Please  --  stop  --  kicking , " Mark gasped . " I do n't want to drop you on your  --  " " Put me down ! " " Where ? " It was a reasonable question . The mattress had been dragged off the bed , trailing sheets and blankets . Every drawer in the dresser and chifferobe stood open , the contents tumbled as if by a giant beater or tossed helterskelteronto the floor . Cardoza leaned against the doorjamb breathing heavily . " Do n't scare me like that , " he said furiously . " I know the room is a mess , I saw it . So are the other bedrooms  --  " Karen burst into tears and buried her face against Mark 's shoulder . " Crying over a bunch of clothes , " Cardoza said , shaking his head . " I 'll never figure women out . There I was thinking what a cool lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's a chauvinist speech if I ever heard one , " Cheryl snapped . " It was delayed shock , that 's what it was . I 'd like to see how you 'd behave after somebody choked you half to death and scared the fits out of you . And what 's more , Tony Cardoza  --  " " Okay , okay . " Cardoza smiled at Cheryl affectionately , as he might have smiled at a pretty child . " I should have warned her , I guess . You too , Cheryl , I thought you were going to start bawling too . " " If you knew how much time and effort it took to get those clothes so nice and pretty , you 'd be more sympathetic . No , put that down ; it 's sweet of you to try and help , but you 're just making more of a mess . " Karen was in her bed , which had been restored to its proper state . Murmuring distressfully , Cheryl was smoothing and folding the crumpled garments . Mark was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out , his expression dour . Cardoza occupied the desk chair ;  |p99arms  folded , one ankle resting on the other knee , he looked quite at home . In fact , there was something insanely cozy about the whole business , and they were all drinking tea  --  which Cheryl seemed to consider a universal panacea  --  except Cardoza , who held a can of beer . " I 'm not driving , " he had explained gravely . " But Mark ca n't have any . " Karen felt rather like a medieval monarch holding court , as those gentry were wont to do in their bedrooms , but even more like a sick child being visited by the grownups . Cheryl had bundled her into the least crumpled of the white nightgowns ; it had long sleeves with ruffles on the cuffs , and it buttoned clear up to its ruffled neckline . " So he got in through a window , " Mark said . " Must have . The back door was standing open , but we can assume he unlocked it after he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lock had n't been tampered with , and one of the downstairswindows was unlocked . " " Stupid , " said Mark , looking at Karen . Cardoza came to her defense . " Those old window locks are easy to force . Too bad people around here are so set on their antiques ; the wooden frames are so warped you can get a crowbar in the crack between the sashes . " " Fingerprints , " said Mark . " Footprints . " " Mark , we 've been over this a dozen times , " Cardoza said patiently . " The back yard is all grass and graveled paths and nice neat mulch . Not a patch of handy mud anywhere . The guy got on the roof of the garden shed and went over the wall . As for fingerprints  --  sure , they 'll check , but most crooks know enough these days to wear gloves . " " In the middle of the summer ? Your favorite junkie , who is supposedly too strung-out to know which end his head is on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Nevitt has a secret enemy who 's out to strangle her ? " Cardoza demanded . Karen 's eyes opened wide . " Hey , wait  --  " " No , of course not , " Mark muttered . " He was alone , " Cardoza said . " Cheryl only saw one person  --  nothing more than a shadow , actually . If there had been two of them or more , they might have . . . well , they might not have run away . So it was n't a gang . Gangs go after TV sets , hi-fi 's , things like that . This guy tore up the bedrooms , not the downstairs . He was looking for money or for jewelry  --  something small and portable he could hock . That 's the obvious , rational conclusion , and I 'm damned if I can see why you 're trying to make something more out of it . " " I 'm not . I just do n't understand why  --  "  |p100The  telephone rang , and Mark reached across Karen and picked it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she is n't able to talk right now . May I take . What ? My name is Brinckley . Mark Brinckley . Who is this ? " In the silence that followed they heard the far-off voice quacking unintelligibly . A wave of dull crimson moved slowly up Mark 's face from the base of his throat to his hairline . Karen sat up . She had seen the phenomenon before . It was not a sign of shame or embarrassment ; Mark was never embarrassed . It was pure red rage . " Give me the phone , " she said , and took it from his hand . " Hello , Jack . " " I 've been trying to reach you all day . Where have you been ? " " Out . " " Obviously . Why have n't you answered the letters from my lawyer ? " The cool incisive voice , with its peremptory tone , affected her as it always had . Instead of replying in kind , she heard herself mutter feebly , " I have n't been . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not too upset to console yourself , I see . It was rather careless of Brinckley to answer the telephone at this hour of the night . Adultery is still grounds for divorce in this state , and some judges are influenced by it when it comes to alimony . " " But I did n't  --  " " Not that I have any objections . Being a fair-minded man , I felt obliged to point out the legal complications you may incur . Personally I 'm relieved that you have found a protector . You are quite incapable of managing your life by yourself . It 's decent of Brinckley to take you back . Some men might be more particular about secondhand goods . But he never was very fastidi-ous . " His voice had risen in pitch and in intensity . " Hang up , " Mark said suddenly . " What ? " Karen felt dazed . Jack was still talking ; he sounded shrill and hysterical . " Hang up the phone . " " Oh . " Karen obeyed . She wiped her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You can get a restraining order , you know . " The telephone rang again . Mark picked it up . He was about to slam it back into the cradle , unanswered , when Cardoza said casually , " Do you mind if I . . . " Mark 's angry color subsided . Smiling grimly , he handed over the telephone . Karen said nothing . She felt bruised and sick with shame . She had a good idea of what Jack had said to Mark.  | " This is Detective Cardoza of the D.C. police , " Cardoza announced . " Who 's this ? " The reply was inaudible . Cardoza grinned and winked at Karen . " Mrs. Nevitt 's home was broken into tonight and she was assaulted . Where did you say you were calling from ? I see . You have witnesses who can verify that , I suppose ? " The quacking began again . Cardoza 's smile broadened , displaying evenwhite teeth . " Yes , I 'm sure you are concerned . I 'll tell her that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That should take care of him . " " Mr. Cardoza , " Karen said earnestly , " I think I love you . " " In that case , you 'd better start calling me Tony . " " If you two have quite finished the compliments , " said Mark , through tight lips , " I 'd like to return to the case at hand . " " There is n't any case , " Tony said , his patience wearing thin . " At least there 's nothing we can follow up . If we had a description . . . " " I did n't even see him , " Karen said . " He grabbed me from behind and it was pitch-dark in the hall . " " You 're sure it was a man ? " " Well , of course . . . No . No , I 'm not sure of anything except that he , she , or it had two hands . " " No distinctive smell ? After-shave , unwashed body . . . " He glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't remember . " " Did you feel anything other than the hands ? Cloth , hair , mustache , fur ? Big hands or small ? Calloused ? " Karen kept shaking her head . " I did n't see him or smell him or feel him or . . . Oh ! " Tony sat up alertly . " What ? " " I heard him , " Karen said slowly . " He whispered . Right in my ear , the same words over and over , like a recording . Where is it , where is it , where is it ? ' "  |p102HE  memory of that obscene whisper was Karen 's last coherent recollection . She was vaguely aware of voices and movement as Cheryl shooed the men out of the room , and she half-heard Cheryl 's statement that she intended to spend the night . She was too drowsy to protest the offer even if she wanted to , which she emphatically did not . Once recalled , the whisper went on echoing in the corridors of her mind ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow her into her dreams . However , she slept heavily and dreamlessly until she was awakened by a thud that shook the bed , and by a hot and not particularly sweet-smelling breath on her face . It was , of course , Alexander . The sight of his prizewinningugliness only inches from her eyes was so horrible she promptly closed them again . Alexander bit her on the nose . Karen sat up with a shriek . Alexander retreated to the foot of the bed , where he sat down and began to bark . The gist of his comments would have been plain to the slowest intelligence . When Karen looked at the clock she was forced to agree he was right . It was after nine o'clock . This was a workday , and she was supposed to be at the shop at eleven . She got out of bed . Except for a sore throat , she felt remarkably well , and the sight of the confusion that still reigned in her room filled her with a burst of anger that sent the adrenaline pumping healthily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do more than fold and hang the crum/pled garments over the chairs and bureau . The empty dangling sleeves and limp skirts looked pathetic . Most would need washing and ironing ; at the thought of all her hours of wasted work , Karen stamped her foot and swore . The door opened a crack before she had finished swearing and Cheryl 's voice remarked , " I do n't blame you , but maybe you should save your strength . Ready for breakfast ? " " You should n't have gone to all that trouble , " Karen said . " No trouble . " Cheryl put the tray on the desk , which was practically the only uncluttered surface in the room . Sadly surveying the confusion , she shook her head . " It sure is a mess . But you know , you 're lucky in a way ; they 're just dirty and wrinkled . I 've heard of cases where the burglars got mad because they could n't find drugs or money and they slashed everything with knives and  --  well  --  got them dirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffed appreciatively . " That coffee smells great . You are going to join me , I hope . " " I brought two cups . " Cheryl pulled up a chair . Alexander , smelling bacon , came out from under the bed and squatted at her feet . Karen scowled at him . " My , my , how charming you are when you smell food . " " He does n't bite people out of meanness , " Cheryl assured her . " It 's just a habit . He sure is devoted to you , he would n't leave your room last night . " " That 's a new twist . He 's been barely civil . " Alexander put his front paws on Cheryl 's knee and barked . Cheryl meekly handed over the strip of bacon she had been about to eat , and Alexander retreated under a chair , growling over his prize . " He does look more cheerful today , " Karen said . " I guess he needed an interest in life . There 's nothing like a burglar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him any prizes as a watchdog . " " It was n't his fault . He was shut up in the dining room . You look pretty cheerful yourself for someone who was half strangled last night . How do you feel ? " " My throat is a little sore , but otherwise I feel fine . " Karen forced down a mouthful of scrambled eggs . Her stomach was still queasy , but she was grateful for Cheryl 's efforts , and even more for Cheryl 's willingness to pretend that nothing more distressing than an attempted burglary had occurred the previous night . " I might be in much worse shape if you had n't rushed to the rescue , " she said . " It was very brave of you , Cheryl , but it was also very foolhardy . How did you get in ? I seem to remember hearing the door slam . . . . " " Well , that was how I knew something was wrong . I figured youp104would n't slam the door in my face and leave me out there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lock . All I saw when I opened the door was something dark and shapeless , fading away into the shadows . By the time I turned on the light and made sure you were n't badly hurt and let Alexander out of the dining room , he 'd gone out the back door . I should have chased him right away . " " Good Lord , no , you should n't have , " Karen said sharply . " You did exactly right . " " You are n't mad because I called Mark ? " " No , I 'm not mad at you . " Karen took a deep breath and plunged into the subject she had avoided . It felt like jumping into a pool , not of water , but of some viscous slimy liquid . " I 'm only sorry you had to overhear that telephone conversation . " " I did n't really hear anything . " " You heard enough to realize what was going on . You know Mark as well as . . . you know him better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can imagine what was being said . Jack has a tongue like an adder ; it leaves welts that sting for days . At least , " Karen said , with a dreary little laugh , " Mark can derive some satisfaction from having his accusations confirmed . I called him paranoid and egotistical when he told me Jack 's principal reason for marrying me was to get back at him . Now I know he was right . I ought to tell him so . It 's the least I can do after subjecting him to that  --  that garbage . " " Stop it , " Cheryl said sharply . " Stop what ? " Karen had expected sympathy ; she had not expected to see a scowl darken Cheryl 's face and hear the anger in her voice . " Stop blaming yourself for everything . So you made a mistake . Everybodymakes them . It 's not your fault that your husband is a mean bastard . And Mark is a big boy . He 's heard a helluva lot worse than your husband can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she clasped her hand over her mouth . " I should n't have said that , " she mumbled , behind it . " I 'm so tactless . . . . " " You are tactful to a fault , " Karen said , recovering from her surprise . " You 've known about Jack and his  --  his little foibles all along , have n't you ? And Mr. Cardoza  --  Tony  --  too . He would n't have been so quick to react if he had n't heard plenty . I guess I can hardly blame Mark for sounding off to his best friends . He has good reason to detest me . " " There you go again . Have you always been little Mrs. Martyr ? What did that man do to you ? " " It was n't all Jack 's fault , " Karen said slowly . " I let him do it . I never was a very aggressive person . My sister was the tough one ; she was smarter , prettier , older , taller . . . . Cheryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not laughing . " " Well , maybe you should . It sounds pretty silly , does n't it ? Sara was  --  is  --  just great . She could n't help being taller , older . . . What was she supposedto do , cut her feet off at the ankles and fail exams to make me feel more secure ? Funny ; I could n't see that at the time  --  that it was my problem , not hers . Then she married Bruce , and they were so happy . . . . Jack sure as hell did n't help . Not that he ever laid a hand on me . He just . . . cut me to ribbons inside , where it did n't show . Like that old jacket . Shattered silk . . . Slow corrosion , attacking the fabric at its weakest points . " " Oh , come on , do n't be so dramatic . " Cheryl 's smile took the sting out of the words . " There 's no remedy for shattered silk  --  right ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm on the road to recovery . It may take a while . " " I 'm glad you told me , " Cheryl said . " So am I. Now we can forget about it . But I wish , " Karen said wistfully , " that I could have seen Jack 's face when Tony practically accused him of attacking me . " Cheryl giggled . " I guess Tony probably should n't have done that . It was like intimidation or exceeding his authority or something . But he got a kick out of it , I could tell . He likes you . Oh , he said to tell you he 'd let you know if they got any leads , but do n't count on it . " " He still thinks it was an amateur  --  someone looking for money to buy drugs ? " " Well , he claims a professional thief would have gone for the antiques and the silver . I guess your aunt 's things are pretty valuable ? " Karen nodded , and Cheryl went on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or he would n't have behaved so inconsistently  --  throwing everythingaround but not damaging or taking anything , trying to choke you and then running like a scared rabbit when I came in . " " But you do n't agree ? " Cheryl looked doubtful . " It sounds too convenient . You know what I mean ? Like saying , I do n't know why he acted that way , so I guess he was out of his mind . Seems to me Mark has a point  --  " " If Mark thinks there 's a maniac out there with my name at the top of his list , I do n't want to hear about it . " " Oh , no , it 's just the opposite . He does n't think the man intended to hurt you ; he just panicked when you walked in on him unexpectedly . Karen , are you sure you heard him say , Where is it ? ' " " I 'm sure . " " He was looking for something , then , " Cheryl said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Karen searched for ap106word . Even the memory of the hoarse whisper made her shiver . " . . . not normal , " she finished weakly . " That fits Tony 's theory of someone on drugs . " " I guess so . But Mark says it 's too much of a coincidence that this should happen so soon after Mrs. Mac 's car was stolen . He wondered if the guy was after something of hers . " Karen jumped up . " Good heavens . I completely forgot . . . " She ran into the master bedroom . The burglar had turned that room into a shambles too . The furniture was heaped high with the crumpled clothing Cheryl had picked up from the floor . But he had not found the secret drawer . The panel slid aside under Karen 's pressure and there was the shabby red morocco case , just as she had left it . She opened it , to make certain the contents had not been disturbed , and carried it in to show it to Cheryl . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't look like the kind of jewelry a burglar would care about . " " It 's the only thing of real value I 've acquired lately , though . Anyhow , if that 's what he was looking for , he did n't find it . Cheryl , you have a very peculiar look on your face . What are you thinking ? " " I was remembering that weird old lady . " " Mrs. Grossmuller ? " Karen 's voice rose incredulously . " I guess you think I 'm silly . " " Why , no . I just  --  " " He did . " Cheryl 's cheeks flamed . " He practically laughed in my face . " It was n't difficult for Karen to deduce the identity of the person referred to . " You told Tony about Mrs. Grossmuller ? " " Yes , I did . I 'm sorry if you did n't want me to . " " I do n't mind . But it is pretty far out , Cheryl . Even admitting she 's that disturbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly ? " " Your address was on your check , " Cheryl said . " She could have gotten it from the auctioneer . And we stopped for supper , that took a couple of hours . Mrs. Grossmuller is a big , stout woman , in spite of her age . And insane people are supposed to have unusual strength . " THE manic strength of the insane . . . Karen did n't know whether it was true or not , but the idea accompanied her through the day like an unwelcomeguest who will not go home . She could not decide whether she preferred to be the victim of a hopped-up young thug or a crazy oldp107woman  --  or , if Mark was right , the unwitting possessor of a valuable objectthat might or might not be still in the house . On the whole , Tony 's theory was less threatening ; random violence was not likely to recur . Rob saw the scratches on her throat and demanded to know what had happened . When she replied briefly that she had been mugged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " and went on to tell her in laborious detail about his own encounters with crime . Monday was usually a slow day , and Karen 's boredom was increased by her desire to get back to the house and deal with the chores that awaited her  --  not only the endless laundry but a number of other tasks she had allowed to accumulate . One , which she might not have thought of doing , had already been done for her . Mark had called a locksmith and asked him  --  or ordered him  --  to make an emergency call . The man had telephoned just before she left the house to say he 'd be there between one and three . Cheryl had offered to wait until he came . " I hope you 're not mad , " she began guiltily . Karen smiled . " You 're a fine one to lecture me about apologizing for the things other people do . I 'm grateful  --  to you and to Mark . Please thank him for me . " But neither of them had mentioned one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the intruder had not had to force a window because he had a key to the house . It was only an unproved theory , after all . Karen had not had time to take the necklace to the bank , or to call Mr. Bates . The latter task at least she could do now . She was n't keen on having Rob eavesdrop , which he would undoubtedly do , but if she waited till she got home , Mr. Bates might have left for the day . She could n't keep putting things off . Jack 's vicious verbal attack had shattered her apathy and inspiredher with an urgent need to be done with him . Knowing Mr. Bates ' busy schedule , she expected she would have to leave a message and wait for him to call her back , but when she gave her name , the secretary put her straight through . " I had expected to hear from you before this " was Mr. Bates ' only greeting . " In fact , I tried several times to reach you , without success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably because it followed a similar complaint from Jack . Really , people had a lot of nerve yelling at her because she was n't available when it happened to suit their convenience . " I 've been busy , " she said . " There are several questions  --  " " Do you still have the Madison jewelry ? " Karen was still annoyed , and his peremptory tone did not soothe her feelings . " I have n't hocked it yet , if that 's what you mean . "  | " I am glad , " said Mr. Bates , in a tone that flatly contradicted his words , " that you can joke about it . One would think that after having been physicallyassaulted  --  " " How did you hear about that ? " " I received a telephone call from Congressman Brinckley . " " Oh . " " The jewelry  --  " " I have it . " Karen heard an audible sigh of relief . She went on , " That was one of the things  --  " " I strongly suggest that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Immediately . " " I ca n't . I 'm in charge here , and we do n't close until five . After that  --  " " After that I am attending a cocktail party . " Mr. Bates brooded briefly . Karen fancied he must be looking through his appointment book . " I will return to the office afterward , " he announced . " Can you be here by seven-thirty ? " " I  --  yes , I suppose so . Why not tomorrow ? " " The answer to that should be self-evident . Not that I subscribe to Congressman Brinckley 's fantastic theory that your assailant was a member of the gang that stole the Rolls  --  " An uncomfortable prickling sensation touched the nape of Karen 's neck . " Wait a minute , " she said . " Wait just a minute . . . . It did n't dawn on me at first . . . . How did Mark  --  Mr. Brinckley  --  know I had somethingof Mrs. MacDougal 's ? Did he mention the jewelry ? " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't tell him . " " Then Mrs. MacDougal must have done so . Really , " the lawyer said impatiently , " this is all beside the point , Mrs. Nevitt . Although I am convincedthere is absolutely no connection between the two events , I do most strongly urge  --  " " Yes , all right , " Karen said abstractedly . " I 'll come at seven-thirty . I also need the name of a good divorce lawyer . " " I will have the information for you this evening . " " Have you heard anything from  --  " Karen began . But the lawyer had hung up . He was definitely annoyed with someone , and Karen suspected it was n't she . Mark must have read him the riot act . It would be like Mark to concoct a wild theory just for the fun of getting the lawyer 's back up . Mrs. MacDougal must have told Mark what she planned to do with Dolley 's jewelry . Or possibly Cheryl had mentioned it to him . She hung up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , Rob wasp109busily reading a paperback novel  --  one of the popular best-sellers focusing on the lives of the rich , dissolute , and famous . His look of profound concentrationwould not have deceived a child . " I hope I talked loudly enough for you to hear without straining yourself , " Karen said . Rob put the book down and smiled sweetly . " It was fascinating , darling . I 'm so pleased you 've decided to press on with your divorce ; it 's a fatal mistake to delay these things . But what 's all this about Mrs. MacDougal 's car , and necklaces and urgent appointments ? " Karen could n't remember having mentioned the car . Rob must have been listening in on the extension in the office . Rather than allow him to speculate and invent preposterous stories , she explained briefly . Rob admitted he had heard about the Rolls . " So thrilling , like one of those super crime films . " The necklace , which Karen described only as a relatively inexpensive personal memento , did n't appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mentioning that she intended to hand it over to the lawyer that evening . In fact , Rob was the last person she would have suspected of trying to throttle her . He would have been more likely to scream and run when she caught him in the house . As for the Dolley Madison jewelry . . . Oh , surely it was absurd to think it was involved . The fact that the intruder had not found it was no proof that he had not looked for it , but no ordinary thief would be aware of its presence . No ordinary thief . . . Her assailant had been no ordinary thief . That thick , hoarse whisper . . . There were only two people , aside from Mr. Bates and Cheryl , who knew she had Dolley 's jewelry . No , Karen thought . It could n't have been Horton . Horton would not have run from Cheryl . Horton 's big-muscled hands could have snapped her neck like a twig . At five o'clock she left Rob to lock up and hurried home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his empty food dish . Not until the dog 's demands had been satisfied did Karen see the note Cheryl had left . The locksmith had come and gone ; the keys were on the hall table . Karen went to look . The keys made a formidable heap ; there were three for each new door lock , front and back , and several more for the elaborate latches that had been added to the downstairs windows . It must have taken the locksmith most of the afternoon . Congressman Brinckley 's influence , Karen thought ; usually it took days to get a service person to come , even in an emergency . But who was she to complain ? She went back to the kitchen and finished reading Cheryl 's note . " I hope you do n't mind , I did a little mending and washing . Love working withp110those things . Have to go to some boring party tonight , will call if we are n't too late getting home . " The telephone rang while Karen was getting supper . It was Western Union with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apology , that they had tried to reach her earlier , without success . The cable read , " I 'll get you for this someday , you traitor . Ruth sends love . I do n't . Pat . " Karen decided she could safely conclude that Mrs. MacDougal had arrived on her son 's doorstep , by gnu or some other means . Grinning , she put a diet TV dinner into the microwave and went upstairs to see what Cheryl had done . " A little " mending and washing turned out to be ludicrouslyunderstated . Many of the petticoats and chemises had been meticulouslylaundered and returned to their hangers . Across the bed lay several pieces of lace ; all had been washed and ironed and one tattered strip had been neatly mended . She was eating supper when the doorbell rang . Before she could get up she had to dislodge Alexander , who was sprawled across her feet . He had insisted on sampling the fish in her frozen dinner and had promptly spat it out . Now he followed her to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening the door , Karen looked out through the small spyhole . Though grotesquely distorted , the figure outside was definitely that of a woman . There was nothing to be afraid of . It was still broad daylight outside , and whoever the caller might be , she was certainly not Mrs. Grossmuller . No distortion , however extreme , could make Mrs. Grossmuller 's stocky figure look so slim . But Karen left the chain in place when she opened the door . Alexander promptly lunged for the opening . The frown on the visitor 's face deepened as she looked down at the furry muzzle trying to push through the crack . " Shut that damned dog up , " she said sharply . Karen stared . What was Shreve Danforth  --  no , Shreve Givens now  --  doing on her doorstep ? She was dressed for a formal dinner or party , in a glittering white dress that set off her deep tan . Diamonds winked at her throat and twinkled in the auburn hair that half-covered her ears . Shreve , who had been so rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . Shreve 's silver shoe began to tap impatiently . " Well , are you going to let me in ? I 'm in rather a hurry . " " Oh . Oh , yes . Of course . Just a minute . " Karen scooped up the dog and shut him in the kitchen . When she returned to the door , Shreve 's foot was tapping faster and she was glancing ostentatiously at her watch . Acutely conscious of her faded housecoat and bare feet , Karen admittedp111her visitor . She wished she could have thought of an excuse for refusing to do so ; something like " Sorry , I think I 'm catching the plague . " The old habit of courtesy had prevailed , and it was too late now . " I 'm sorry it took me so long , " she said . " I 'm rather wary of letting people in until I 'm sure who they are . Someone broke in here last night  --  " " Oh , really ? " Shreve 's lips stretched into an expression that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken . " " No . I had new locks put on , though . Mark was kind enough to send a locksmith around this afternoon . " Now why had she said that ? Karen knew the answer , but she could have kicked herself for challenging an opponent like Shreve . The other woman 's smile widened as she looked Karen over , from her unkempt hair to her dusty feet . Gently she said , " Mark has such a kind heart . He spends a lot of time with old Mrs. MacDougal too . " Well , I deserved that , Karen thought . I should have known better ; I ca n't fight her on her terms . With freezing politeness she said , " Can I offer you something to drink ? " " No . " Shreve reached into her bag and took out a checkbook . " I just stopped by to get those things of Granny 's . She had no right to sell them to you . The old witch is completely goofy . I believe you paid her seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener the essential clue . " Mrs. Ferris is your grandmother ? " " Yes , did n't you know ? " Shreve uncapped a gold pen and began to write , resting the checkbook on the hall table . " Seventy-five . . . " " It was seventy-eight fifty , to be precise . " Karen braced herself . " But I wo n't take your check . " " How much do you want , then ? " Shreve asked coolly . " Nothing . Not from you . I have n't had a chance to inspect all the merchandise yet , but that 's what it is to me  --  merchandise . It was an honest business transaction  --  " " Business , " Shreve murmured . " I suppose it is good business to take advantage of a senile old woman . " Karen was so angry she felt lightheaded . The sensation was rather agreeable . " It 's called free enterprise , Shreve . I 'm surprised you have n't heard of it . Your husband is such an enthusiastic supporter of the sys-tem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed a blow at her face . It was a low blow , Karen thought , as her anger gave way to self-contempt . Congress had finally confirmed Mr. Givens ' appointment , but not until after a long and acrimonious debate over certain " questionable business practices . "  | " Is there anything of yours in the boxes ? " Karen asked . " Good Lord , no . " This suggestion seemed to outrage Shreve even more than Karen 's refusal to sell . " What gave you that idea ? " " I only meant that if your grandmother had sold something that was n't hers , I would of course return it . " " I see . " Shreve bit her lip . " I think I will have a drink after all . Do you have Stolichnaya vodka ? " " I do n't know . " " Vodka and tonic , with just a squeeze of lime . If you do n't have Stolichnaya I 'd prefer plain Perrier and lime . " " I 'll see , " Karen said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Pat preferred another , cheaper brand of vodka , and had unearthed a lone bottle of Perrier from the back of the liquor cabinet , she was  --  she fondly hoped  --  in control of her temper . There was n't a lime in the house , nor did she bother looking for one . She had not asked Shreve to sit down , but she found her in the parlor , poised on the edge of the sofa and looking about her with cool interest . " Ruth really ought to replace those draperies , " she remarked . " They are quite faded . Maybe it 's just as well she did n't ; by the time the dog gets through with them she 'll need new ones . " Karen handed her the glass and a coaster . She was determined to behave like a lady if it killed her , but she wanted to get Shreve out of the house as soon as she could . The very sight of her , poised and slim and elegant , was like a shoe rubbing a blister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . " Wedding veil ? " Shreve looked blank . " I do n't give a damn about Gran 's junk . I just do n't like the idea of its being displayed in some cheap shop window , where people can see it and say that Gran was so poor she had to sell her clothes  --  that her family was n't taking proper care of her . " The secret was out . All Shreve cared about was what people would say . Karen found it more believable than sentiment , a quality Shreve obviously lacked . It did not make her feel any more kindly toward Shreve . " No one would recognize your grandmother 's things . And anyway , if Mrs. MacDougal is n't embarrassed at having her clothes in a shop window , it should n't bother you . Hers are very distinctive and very valuable , and she told me I could  --  " " I 'll give you a hundred and fifty . " " No . " " Why not ? " " I hope to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowed unpleasantly . " How much more ? " " I 'm afraid you are missing the point , " Karen said . " I am in business top113make as much money as I can . The value of the merchandise I sell depends on a number of different factors , primarily on what people are willing to pay . " Shreve continued to stare at her , lips pressed tightly together , and some imp of perversity made Karen add , " When they are ready for sale , cleaned and pressed and mended , I 'll let you know . If you care to pay the price , they 're all yours . " " I see , " Shreve said slowly . " I 'm to be allowed to bid  --  is that it ? " " No bidding , no haggling . I set the price ; you pay it or someone else will . And now , if you 'll excuse me , I have an appointment and I 've barely time to change . " SHE really was late , but instead of dashing upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hall , to the consternation of Alexander , whom she freed from bondage as she passed the kitchen door . " I 'm sorry , " Karen said breathlessly . " That was a dance of triumph , Alexander . You would n't understand , and anyway I have n't time to explain it to you . " Talking to the dog was only one step better than talking to herself , but she had to crow to someone . A month ago she would not have been able to handle Shreve as ably as she had . She would have meekly accepted the check and handed over the merchandise , as Shreve had expected she would . Shreve was n't accustomed to having people bite her back , especiallysomeone she remembered as quiet and yielding . It would have been a fatal mistake to give in , for it would have set a precedent , for herself if not for her customers . She might end up doing something as asinine as letting Mrs. Grossmuller buy her wedding dress back for two bits . What was more , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been extreme . As she came downstairs , neatly if hastily attired , she remembered Shreve 's insolence , and the anger she had suppressed boiled up stronger than before . How Mark could fall for such a vulgar , arrogant woman . . . But it was n't Shreve 's personality that interested Mark . He was kind and charitable to old friends and former enemies , but he liked his women slim and sexy and influential . Stop it , Karen told herself . She concentrated intently on locking the door . The new keys were a trifle stiff , but they would probably loosen up in time . It was lucky for Karen that she approached her interview with the lawyer in such high spirits , for he did everything possible to depress her.  |p114He  looked exactly like the picture she had formed of him in her mind  --  a little man , short and spare , with a narrow , closed-in face . His eyes were obscured by thick glasses and his thinning hair had been carefully brushed across his bald spot . He held a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made his chief concern evident . " The jewelry , Mrs. Nevitt . May I  --  " " I did n't bring it . " Karen settled herself more comfortably . " You did n't . . . . May I ask why not ? " His tone was only too reminiscent of the one Jack used to demoralize and intimidate her . This time Karen refused to yield . She was getting tired of being pushed around ; instead of explaining and apologizing , she went on the attack . " What are you worried about , Mr. Bates ? The jewelry or me ? " " Why  --  I  --  " " Because if it 's the jewelry , that 's no longer your responsibility . It belongs to me , and I intend to wear it and enjoy it as Mrs. Mac meant me to , not lock it up in a bank . And if you are afraid I might be in danger from someone who wants it  --  " " Nonsense , " said Mr. Bates shortly . " Okay , it 's nonsense . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my getting rid of a potential danger unless the presumed thief knows I 've gotten rid of it . I should have come here carrying a sign ? Attention , everybody : Dolley 's jewelry is being handed over to Mr. Bates ' ? " " Really , Mrs. Nevitt  --  " " If anyone is watching me , my visit to you this evening will suggest to them that I 've handed the jewelry over . What further precautions could I take , short of putting an advertisement in the newspaper ? Now , if you do n't mind , I 'd like to discuss something more important . " Mr. Bates sighed , adjusted his glasses , brushed his hair back from his high forehead , and gave her his full attention . He took a dim view of her plans . A young woman with no business experience had , in his opinion , little hope of success . But Karen was moved almost to tears when he grudgingly informed her that her uncle by marriage had cabled to put a large sum of money at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have heard from Pat , then , " she murmured , reaching for a tissue and pretending she was blotting away perspiration . " That was one of the things I wanted to ask you . " Mr. Bates eyed her warily . He knew perfectly well that emotion rather than heat had necessitated the tissue , and he obviously disapproved of women who wept . " Yes . Only the information I have just given you , and the news thatp115Mrs . MacDougal senior has arrived safely . I must add that had Professor MacDougal consulted me before arranging for a transfer of funds , I would have counseled him  --  " " You need n't worry , " Karen cut in . " I have no intention of abusing Pat 's generosity . Now I wonder if you would mind reading these letters from my husband 's lawyer . It may be a few days before I can get an appointment and they sound very peremptory . " Her quick recovery from ill-conceived emotion brought a frosty gleam of approval to Mr. Bates ' pale-gray eyes . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " It appears you may have a fight on your hands , Mrs. Nevitt . The offers are outrageous . I beg you will not reply in any way until you have consulted the attorney I will recommend to you . " Karen assured him she was not that stupid , and Mr. Bates looked as if he would like to have believed her but could n't quite manage it . There was no news about the missing automobile or the missing chauffeur . The police investigation had fizzled out  --  Mr. Bates did n't use the word , but that was what it amounted to . Yes , he had cabled Mrs. MacDougalabout the car . He had not yet received a reply . He would let Karen know when he got word . He would give them all her love . And would she please  --  implicit in his manner , if not expressed  --  get the hell out of his office and let him go home ? The long summer twilight was dying as Karen stood on the corner waiting for a bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with exhaust fumes , and according to an electric sign on a nearby corner , the temperaturewas still in the high eighties . No wonder Washingtonians fled the city in late July and August . The only wonder was that they had functioned so long without air-conditioning . The affectionate phrase , " the Federal Swamp , " though it had acquired other connotations , had originally been a literal description of geographical fact . A bus lumbered into sight but stopped half a block away as the traffic light turned red and cars and trucks barred its further progress . Karen glanced casually at the poised traffic , and suddenly froze . A brand-new bright-red , Ferrari convertible , in the middle lane . . . The top was down . The twin mufflers throbbed as the driver jiggled the gas pedal , ready to take off the instant the light changed . As if the intensity of her stare sent out palpable waves , the driver turned his head and looked directly at her . His full red lips pursed like those of a girl expecting to be kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she knew what he had said . Before she could react , the light changed and the convertible took off like a bullet , narrowly avoiding a crossing van that had run the last second of the yellow . Karen turned and bolted back into the building she had just left.  |p116Mr  . Bates drove her home . He could hardly avoid doing so ; she had caught him as he emerged from the elevator , his car keys in his hand . He felt sure she had been mistaken . " There are many men of that type , " he said distastefully . " We had been speaking of the matter , so it was on your mind . I assure you , Horton is miles away by now . He would not be so foolish as to remain in the city . " " I know it was Horton . He knew me . He said , Hi , doll . ' " But you informed me you could not hear  --  " " I read his lips . He called me doll once before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't you at least notify the police ? It was a new red Ferrari with Virginia plates , and the first two letters were BY . You know whom to talk to , and they 'll pay more attention to you . " " Very well . However , I feel certain they will inform me that Horton has been seen in three other places , all miles from Washington . " Despite his skepticism he insisted on going to the door with her and on waiting until she had opened it . He did n't have to insist much . This time she managed to catch Alexander 's collar while he was in mid-leap as Mr. Bates , obviously only too familiar with the dog 's habits , skipped nimbly aside . " Thank you , " she said , as the lawyer cast a keen if seemingly casual glance inside . " I hope I have n't taken you out of your way . " " Not at all . I live in Chevy Chase ; I can as easily go up Wisconsin as Connecticut . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place ? Karen wondered . Mr. Bates might make light of her identification of the chauffeur , but he was n't altogether easy in his own mind or he would not have accompanied her home after hearing her story . Horton knew where she lived ; he might even have a key to the house . Mrs. Mac probably had one , and she was notoriously careless with her possessions . Thank goodness for the new locks , Karen thought . The darkening air was still breathlessly hot , but a shiver ran through her as she pictured Horton 's big brown hands and fleshy , smiling mouth . She still could not believe Horton had been her attacker . But now he had a reason to seek her out . If he thought he could silence her before she told the police she had seen him . . . She knew she was overreacting . Anyone who drove breezily around the city in a car as conspicuous as that one obviously was n't concerned about being seen . Either Horton was extremely stupid , or he just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enjoy being hugged . Karen carried him back into the house and locked the door.  |p117She  wandered restlessly through the various rooms , turning on lights , checking and rechecking the locks on the doors and windows . The house was very quiet , very empty . She found herself hearing sounds that were not there  --  the ghostly echo of Pat 's booming laughter , Ruth 's quiet voice . If only they had been in some civilized part of the world she would have been tempted to call them . There was no one she could call , no familiar voice that was reachable by telephone . Karen knew what was wrong with her . It had different names , some simple , some ponderous and scientific  --  shock , post-stress syndrome , whatever . It was , simply and starkly , an awareness of her own vulnerability . She was no more open to attack than she had ever been  --  less so , in fact , thanks to the new locks and her heightened awareness of danger . But her sense of safety had been violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no right to intrude . She had heard other victims of crime speak of the sensation . Now she knew how it made people feel  --  naked , exposed , helpless . She went to the kitchen and put the kettle on . The refrigerator clicked ; she jumped and cried out . I 've got to stop this , she thought . I 'll drive myself crazy if I go on this way . Find something to do , something to occupy my mind . . . She made the rounds once more , compulsively relocking doors that were already locked , touching window latches , looking out into the street and the garden . Alexander ought to go out once more . Alexander would have to take his chances , that was all . Before she lured the dog upstairs with a handful of his favorite dog munchies , she pushed a chair against the back door and piled it with pots and pans . She felt more relaxed after she had locked herself in her room and climbed into bed with a book . Pat had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Karen hoped the exotic and unlikely perils encountered by those fictitious heroes would distract her  --  rather like hitting oneself with a hammer to forget the pain of a broken leg . It was not long before she knew she had made a mistake . The tough , wise-cracking PI was captured by members of the drug ring he was investigating . The author lingered with loving affection on the tortures inflicted by the chief villain  --  " a big , hulking character with a pretty pouting mouth like that of a girl expecting to be kissed . " Karen threw the book across the room and turned on the television , only to encounter another cynical wise-cracking PI being beaten up by members of a drug ring he was investigating . She was relieved to be able to settle for the late news . Forest fires in the Western states , drought in the Northeast , tornadoes in the Midwest ; break/down of the arms talks , plane crashes , riots , and murders . But the gian t pandas were making love . Thank God for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since TV at its most engrossing occupies only half the mind of the beholder , she looked around for some thing else to do . There was more than enough to do . Jack 's caustic comments about her lack of organization had not been entirely unjustified . She hated keeping records , making lists , balancing accounts . But accurate records were essentialfor the business she hoped to start . At Mrs. Mac 's suggestion ( i.e. , order ) she had bought a looseleaf notebook and some paper . It took her quite a while to find them , and when she did , she was dismayed to see so many empty pages . She had n't meant to fall so far behind . Leafing through the book , she realized she had not even finished listing the items from Ruth 's attic . The idea was to have a separate page for each article , giving the source and the price paid , plus notes on repairs , restoration methods , and  --  ultimately  --  theselling price . Not only would she need the information for tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen grimaced . Oh , well ; there was nothing like concentrating on a hated , boring job to get her mind off other worries . While the anchorman 's voice droned on , she dragged out a box of miscellaneouslinens and got to work . They had come from Mrs. Ferris , and they reminded her of Shreve . So Shreve wanted Granny 's things , did she ? If she could see the condition of the pieces she would n't touch them with the tip of her fastidious finger . Karen shook out a tattered petticoat and sneezed violently as dust billowedup around her . The old lady must have worn it to scrub floors or climb fences ; the fabric was torn , and covered with ugly black spots . But the deep flounce of the lace might be salvageable . Karen found a pair of scissors and cut it off , then wadded the rest of the garment and threw it into the wastebasket , wrinkling her nose at the sour smell of mold . She forced herself to finish sorting and listing the contents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she would never get the smell of mold off her hands . Cheryl had not called . One more chore , Karen thought , and then I 'll go to bed . She wo n't call after midnight  --  but it 's not quite midnight yet . The flounce she had removed from the old petticoat might be right for Mrs. Grossmuller 's wedding dress . For some reason the mold had not affected the lace . Perhaps it had something to do with the type of fabric . After a prolonged search she finally located the dress at the back of the wardrobe . Cheryl must have picked it up off the floor of the hall , along with the other things Karen had bought at the auction  --  and droppedp119when the fumbling hands found her throat . Yes , the rest of them were there  --  the frayed petticoat with the crocheted trim , the absurd bloomers , and the linen nightgown . A muted howling from without rose and fell  --  Mr. DeVoto 's cat , seekingromance and/or a fight . Karen identified the sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his sleep . She decided she had better list the auction items while their origin was still fresh in her mind . " Lace-trimmed bloomers , circa 1910 , " the name of the auctioneer , and the date . She entered the dress last , and her writing faltered . But she had the information ; it would be ridiculous to omit it . " Wedding dress of Mrs. Henry Grossmuller , 1931 . " Mrs. Henry Grossmuller , who poisoned Henry in 1965 and who claimed the dress was n't worth two bits . " I will not write that down , " Karen said aloud . No need to , she would never forget it . Damn the old woman , and damn Cheryl too , for talking about the romance of old clothes and the tragedy of a terrified young bride . .. . No , that was n't fair . Cheryl had not blathered on about auras and vibes , she had better sense . It was Karen 's own imagination that invested the innocent fabric with an almost palpable coating of some dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Karen inspected it she knew her first assessment had been correct . The lace was beyond repair ; the staining substance had had a corrosive effect , leaving great rents in the delicate web . Into Karen 's mind popped a vivid , most unwelcome picture of Mrs. Grossmuller kneeling by her husband 's body , the flounce of her wedding dress trailing in a pool of his blood . She really must get her imagination under control . It would be an effectivescenario for a horror film  --  the abused wife putting on the dress she had worn as an unwilling bride before wreaking her vengeance on her torturer . But Mrs. Grossmuller had n't stabbed Henry , she had poisoned him . Karen let out a gasp of laughter . One day she might be able to tell the Mrs. Grossmuller story and find it genuinely funny . But at best it would always be black humor , for there was something sad and twisted behind the old woman 's insistence  --  guilt or fear or frustrated anger . Like the anger she herself had felt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind back to business . The lace she had removed from the petticoat was just right . It was the same width , and there was so much of it that she could remove the damaged sections and still have enough left to edge the dress . She took the lace into the bathroom and dunked it in warm water , to soak overnight . Now all she needed to restore the dress were pearls ( hersp120would n't be genuine , but the originals had n't been either ) and a silk flower to replace the limp brown specimen on the hipline . She cut off a pearl bead to serve as a sample and began a list of needed materials on a page at the back of the book . As she had already discovered from her earlier attempts at mending the old garments , ordinary cotton and polyester sewing thread was often too coarse . Shops specializing in fine fabrics carried silk thread . She ought to lay in a supply , in a variety of colors , and get needles to match . Buttons  --  old ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , but there must be sources for such things . She kept glancing at the clock . At twelve-thirty she decided Cheryl would n't call so late . At any rate , she was now tired enough to sleep soundly . As she had hoped , the need to concentrate on a specific task had quieted her nerves . There was nothing wrong with Alexander 's nerves , but unfortunately his bladder was not as good . He wanted to go out and he would not take no for an answer . When he started to lift his leg against the bed flounce , Karen gave in . There were too many things Alexander could ruin if he chose , and unless he got his own way , he probably would choose . She had to disassemble the tottering structure of pans in order to open the door . Alexander shot out like an arrow from a bow . The night air was still and hot , with trails of ground mist curdling among the shrubbery . A furious rattle of foliage and a feline squawl explained the dog 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed to address a rude remark to its pursuer . Karen saw its eyes glow eerily red . A Siamese cat . Mr. DeVoto always had Siamese . Alexander returned the cat 's compliments in his own tongue . Not until the Siamese left , melting into the darkness with only a rustle of leaves to prove it material , did Alexander go about his business . He took his own sweet time about it , probably to punish Karen for being so reluctant to let him out , and she swore at him under her breath as she shifted uneasily from one foot to the other . There was no sense in yelling at him and disturbing the neighbors ; and he would n't pay attention anyway . She did not want to go out after him . The mist was thickening , and although there was not a breath of air stirring , the pale trails of fog seemed to sway and shift , with a motion of their own . Alexander finally gave up  --  she assumed he had been backtracking the cat  --  and came in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pots . Alexander followed her from room to room whuffling irritably . He knew he was entitled to a dog biscuit but Karen held off giving it to him until after he had gone upstairs with her . In the dream that quickly seized her she was picking her way across a landscape covered with tumbled ruins , cyclopean columns , and fallenp121blocks of stone . The stones were carved with reliefs ; but though she examinedthem with an absurd and nightmarish intensity , she could not make out their meaning . At last , dim in the purple distance , she caught a glimpse of some intact structure towering high above the plain . She ran toward it . A tottering column crumpled and collapsed ; the fragments struck the earth , not with a solid thud , but ringing like metal . The dog 's barking shot her out of sleep , every muscle knotted . Alexanderwas at the window . The scraping of his claws on the glass made her skin crawl . Karen fumbled for the lamp . It seemed to take forever to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door , clawed at it , trotted back to the window . The cat , Karen thought . He must have heard the cat . Siamese have loud voices . Audible through closed windows , the hum of air-conditioning ? Clinging to the idea of the cat as to a lifeline , she got out of bed and went to the window . The mist had condensed into a layer of solid fog . The roofs and chimneysof the houses on the street behind the garden were invisible ; nearer shapes shone ghostly , soft gray tree trunks pearly with wet , garden chairs gleaming like silver thrones in the glow of the lights by the back door . Something was sitting in one of the chairs . It was on the terrace , close enough to the lights so that she should have been able to identify the shape that occupied it  --  filled it , rather , like a giant featherbed that had been punched and pummeled into a rough imitation of a human form . It might have been the fog that softened its outlines so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to bark , but he was so short of breath the sound came out in weird little squeaks . It was probably this touch of low comedy that kept Karen on her feet . The sound that came from her taut throat was a rather pathetic echo of Alexander 's squeak , but she meant it for laughter , and the hands she raised hardly shook at all . She unfastened the window and threw up the sash . The thing in the chair rose up and drifted across the yard . It was quite opaque . However , its means of locomotion were as uncanny as its general appearance , for it seemed to float , without haste , threading a path around the rose bushes and the trees until it was swallowed up by the fog . Alexander ran to the door . I ca n't open it , Karen thought . But neither could she remain in her room without knowing what might be outside the locked door . Alexander sounded like one of his own squeaky toys , but his small size and shortness of breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could she , a member of a supposedly superior species , do less ? Karen unlocked the door , but she let Alexander go first . Not until she heard a horrible crash from the kitchen did she realize she had made a mistake . Alexander had flung himself head-long into the pile of assorted hardware , and now she would never know whether some or all of them had already fallen , producing the far-off ringing sound that had entered her dreams and had , perhaps , wakened Alexander from his . The lights in the hall burned steadily . She took a poker from the set of fireplace tools and went out of the room . By the time she reached the kitchen Alexander was pushing the pots around with his nose looking for something edible . He had clearly lost interest in going out . The door was locked . She gave Alexander the treat he deserved and they went upstairs together . The dog was sound asleep within minutes , but Karen sat by the window looking out until the sounds of morning traffic began and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at the dining room table . On it lay an antique petticoat she was shortening and altering for a customer who had been visibly disconcertedwhen the waistband did n't begin to go around her purportedly twenty-five-inch waist . Since the petticoat was too long anyway , the solutionwas simple  --  take off the waistband and shorten the garment from the top  --  but the execution was not so easy , for the measurements had to be accurate and the fabric of the new waistband had to match the timesoftenedmuslin of the original . The scrap of material Karen held in her hand was not designed to be a new waistband . It was the wrong shape and size  --  roughly triangular , about three inches at the base . Nor , unless her recently acquired knowledge of fabrics misled her , was it old . A polyester-and-cotton blend , brand new and unstained except for a smear of rust from the nail on which it had been caught . It might have been torn from a bed sheet . Karen had found it that morning , hanging from a nail on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that someone had been in the yard the night before . As Tony had pointed out , the garden was too neatly tended to take footprints . Pat and Ruth had a part-time gardener who came several times a week . Apparently his working hours coincided with Karen 's , for she had never set eyes on him . Perhaps the gardener would know if there was any sign of disturbance , but it was hardly worthwhile trying to locate him . She had nop124intention of telling anyone of the incident , including the police . They had already heard from her twice in the last two days , assuming Mr. Bates had passed on the information about Horton . It was n't exactly a case of the boy who cried " wolf , " for there had definitely been a wolf of sorts in her hallway ; but she had a feeling the police would get a trifle blase about her complaints if she called them every day . Anyway , the scrap of cloth was n't evidence  --  the police would probably think it had been torn from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than silly , it sounded demented . A ghost in the garden , lady ? Well , you know these old Georgetown legends . Her lips tightly set , Karen put the scrap in an envelope and laid it aside . There was no doubt in her mind that the affair had been designed for one purpose only  --  to frighten her . After trying the door and discovering he could not get in , the unknown had roused Alexander  --  perhaps he had thrown gravel at the window  --  and lingered until the light in her bedroom went on , so that she would be sure to see him . The fog had been a helpful but not essential adjunct to his performance ; and the weather forecast would have informed him that some such meteorological phenomenon could be expected that night . Instead of reducing her to a state of quivering terror , the incident had had precisely the opposite effect . She was getting tired of people trying to intimidate her ; and a clumsy , childish trick like that one added insult to injury . Rob was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Damn him , she thought , surveying the unemptied ashtray on the front desk and the tumbled folders scattered across the table . It would n't have taken him five minutes to tidy up . She straightened the folders , observing that a scant half dozen of the Georgetown book remained . It had been selling like hot cakes , all right ; Julie 's cynical assessment had been accurate . Maybe I 'd better have another look at it , Karen thought . Maybe I can find a nasty scandal about someone else I know . Not mentioning any names . . . Would n't it be funny if Shreve were anxious to retrieve Granny 's things because somewhere in the lot was evidence of an antique misdemeanor Granny had committed ? Rob finally sauntered in , magnificent in designer jeans and shirt , his hair newly styled . " Like it ? There 's the dearest little person in a new place on M Street ; he could do wonders for you , duckie , you ought to give him a try . He then retreated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lean hips swaying , muscles rippling , hair gleaming , and smiled ruefully as a familiar sensation rippled through some of her own muscles . Nop125wonder women found Rob so devastating . He must work like a fiend to keep that body looking the way it did . Too bad he had such a feeble little mind to go with it . During the next lull in business she opened her notebook , which she had decided to carry with her  --  as if it were a magic talisman promising success , or as if some variety of osmosis would magically transfer onto its blank pages the information she needed to put there . Lists , she thought . Why is it I ca n't make lists ? Some people love to make them . Sometimes they even get around to doing the things on the lists . She had accomplished one thing that morning ; she had called one of the lawyers on the list Mr. Bates had given her , and she had an appointment for the following day . But her brief sense of accomplishment faded when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small chores , quickly done . Find a suitable building ; see what work needs to be done ; call contractors , plumbers , electricians ; apply for a permit  --  permits , rather  --  heaven only knew how many she would need and for what . . . . Karen groaned and dropped her head into her hands . That was just the beginning . She ought to be attending auctions and flea markets and yard sales . Visiting museums . Reading her reference books . Washing , mending , finding sewing supplies . And dealing with the most basic question of all : What was she going to use for money ? The solution slipped into her mind so smoothly and gently that she knew it must have been there all along . What she needed was a partner . Any business enterprise  --  including marriage , she told herself wryly  --  requirestwo people if it is to succeed . Two bodies , since one person ca n't be in two places at the same time ; two pairs of hands to lighten burdens and carry twice the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheryl had , or would soon have , the business training she lacked . Cheryl did n't wince when the word " computer " was mentioned . She was fascinated by the old garments , good with a needle , intelligent . She was easy to get along with . She had a sense of humor . ( After dealing with Julie , Karen appreciated the importance of the last two attributes . ) Cheryl had even mentioned that she had a little money saved and that eventually she hoped to invest it in her own business . It was the perfect solution . In fact , as she remembered some of the things Cheryl had said , Karen realized that she had dropped several broad hints . So why had it taken her so long to recognize it ? She knew the answer . One word . A name . It was high time she got the name and the complex , difficult emotions it aroused , out of her system . She could now admit that Mark also had somep126right to feel injured . If he could forgive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason why they could n't be friends . " Friendly " was the word for his behavior the other night . Strange that a word so warm and comforting when applied to one person should sound so cold when applied to another . . . . Men seemed to prefer the kind of life he was presently leading , without commitments , flitting from woman to woman as the King of Siam had advised , having casual extramarital flings with the wives of colleagues and associates . There 's plenty of that going on , Karen reminded herself with a sour smile . Men were n't the only ones who had no qualms about the Seventh Commandment . She decided she would talk to Cheryl that evening . Of course she might be mistaken ; Cheryl might not be interested . But even the possibility lifted Karen 's spirits . She gathered up her despised lists with new determination and carried them back to the office , ordering Rob to man the shop . She was at Julie 's desk scribbling busily when she heard the doorbells tinkle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers . " Darling , how divine to see you . I do hope you want to buy lots and lots of expensive goodies . " Rob had a lot in common with anchovies  --  either you adored him or he made you slightly nauseous . Karen decided she had better go out and see which category the customer belonged to . Judging by her expression , she belonged to the second category . Her frown smoothed out when she saw Karen , and then Karen recognized her . The old school ties were strengthening ; it was Miriam Montgomery , who had been with Shreve on an earlier visit to the shop , and who had snubbed her almost as thoroughly as Shreve . Though she wore a well-cut linen dress , she did n't have Shreve 's style ; the garment hung from her slumped shoulders like any cheap copy from a department-store rack . Her flat , rather doughy features showed the same combination of expensive equipmentimproperly employed ; her mascara was too dark for her pale-blue eyes and her lipstick was smeared . She returned Karen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance as definitive as a royal " We give you leave to go . " Rob winked at Karen and discreetly faded away . " How can you stand working with that man ? " Miriam asked . Her voice was high-pitched and rather whiny . " He 's such a poseur . " " Oh , Rob 's not so bad , " Karen said , knowing full well that the office door had been left open a crack . " Are you looking for something in particular , Miriam , or would you rather browse in peace ? " " I came to talk to you . " Miriam frowned at an almost invisible spot on her white handbag . " I hope you do n't think I was rude the other day . "  | " Why , no . " " I 'm afraid I was . I did n't mean to be . It 's Shreve 's fault . Of course she 's an old friend and I 'm terribly fond of her , but she is awfully bossy . And tactless . You 'd think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned a little discretion . But no , she just charges straight ahead like a bull in a china shop , without realizing that she antagonizes people . " Nothing like an old friend who is terribly fond of you to cut you down , Karen thought . Aloud she said carefully , " Shreve always had a  --  a strong personality . " " Anyway , I thought I ought to explain why I behaved so rudely . " " You were n't rude . Do n't give it another thought . " " I do n't like people to think badly of me , " Miriam murmured . Karen reassured her again . Miriam seemed to require a lot of reassurance . Who would have supposed that a woman so richly endowed with worldly goods could be so insecure ? According to Julie , Mr. Montgomery was one of the wealthiest men in the Southeast . " I 'm so glad you understand , " Miriam said . " Now I hope you can help me . I 'm thinking of giving a little party next month . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't imagine why . . . . " Her voice trailed off indecisively . " The good old days , " Karen said . " What was so good about them ? I would n't want to live my high school years over  --  would you ? " " No , " Karen said , with an involuntary grimace . " I guess not . So you want a theme for your party , is that it ? " " How clever of you ! And I suppose I 'll need a dress , wo n't I ? " " From the seventies ? " Karen asked doubtfully . She was getting used to customers who took forever to tell her what they wanted , possibly because they did n't know themselves . " I need something really smashing . I guess the seventies are n't really ' in , ' are they ? " " Not in terms of vintage clothing , no . I have a few fifties and sixties dresses , but I would n't call them smashing . Some of the younger girls like those styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or quaint . " " What do you recommend ? " The spot on Miriam 's handbag seemed to bother her ; she picked at it with a manicured nail . " What about the twenties ? I have some gorgeous dresses from that period . And you have the right figure for them . " Miriam smoothed her flat stomach complacently . " I try to keep in shape . The twenties ? Yes , that could be fun . Jazz and prohibition and  --  and that sort of thing . "  |p128Like  bootleggers and gang wars , Karen thought . Oh well , nostalgia is in the eye of the beholder . " I have several beautiful flapper dresses , " she said . " But they are n't here ; they are designer originals and very expensive . " " I assumed they would be , " said Miriam . She wanted to see the dresses and she wanted to see them right away . She was perfectly pleasant about it ; her excuse for insisting on immediate service  --  that she lived in Middleburg and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen did not hesitate long . She suspected Miriamwas trying to do her a favor , as a way of apologizing for her rudeness the week before . If she did n't strike while the iron was hot , Miriam might change her mind , and she would lose a sale . Besides , Rob owed her for several long lunches and early departures . At Karen 's suggestion they walked to the house . This time she rememberedAlexander and managed to collar him before he could sink his teeth into Miriam 's leg . Miriam did not care for Alexander . She was rude enough to refer to him as a " hideous creature , " and Alexander , resenting the insult , growled and struggled to free himself as Karen bore him away . Miriam 's attitude was now much more that of customer to shopkeeper ; she seated herself regally in the parlor and let Karen trot up and down stairs with the dresses . They had to be carried one at a time , for the weight of the crystal drops and beads was so great that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed pleased and a little surprised at the beauty of the gowns ; she wavered for some time between two that bore the names of famous designers . Both were the standard straight chemises with slit skirts . One was covered from neckline to hem with white crystal beads , on white silk . The other had iridescent Venetian glass beads on pale-aqua crepe de chine ; the slightest movement bathed the wearer in a soft shimmer , like a mermaid in the moonlight . The color was flattering to Miriam 's washed-out complexion , but she seemed loath to give up the white . Finally she shrugged . " I may as well take both . How much ? " " Do n't you want to try them on ? " Karen asked in surprise . " No , there 's no need . You 'll pack them for me , I assume . " " Oh , I ca n't let you have them today , " Karen exclaimed . " Some of the beads are loose , and you can see they need cleaning  --  " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will they be ready ? " " I 'm not sure . I 'll have to ask the cleaners how long it will take . Shall I let you know ? " " All right . " Miriam reached for her checkbook . " How much ? " Karen took a deep breath . " The Hattie Carnegie is nine hundred and fifty . " There was no reaction from Miriam except a slight movement of impatience as she sat with her pen poised . Karen went on , " The white onep129is  --  is thirteen hundred . That comes to two thousand , two hundred and fifty . Plus tax . " Miriam stared at her . " You 've got to be kidding . " " I know it seems like a lot , but the white one was handmade by Callot Soeurs . " Miriam 's face was as blank as a doll 's . Karen said firmly , " I could probably get more from someone else , Miriam . I 'm giving you a break because I hope you will want other things  --  and recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay me now . Or you can give me a deposit , if you like . " Miriam bent her head over the checkbook and began to write. ++4,4x . AFTER Miriam had left , Karen stood admiring the check she held . Two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars , plus tax . The full amount . That had been really decent of Miriam . One could n't blame her for her initial protest . A woman who could casually dash off a check for over two thousand dollars might not be expected to balk at such a sum , but Karen knew from experience that the richer the customer , the more likely she was to haggle . Of course a third of the money belonged to Mrs. MacDougal , and today 's sale was an unusual event , one that would n't happen often . All the same , it deserved a celebration . Karen decided she would not go back to work . It was four-thirty and she felt sure Rob had already closed up . She went flying down the hall to release Alexander from the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and hugged him . " Steak for you tonight , my boy . And champagne for me ! " Alexander 's ears pricked up . He had an extensive vocabulary , and " steak " was a word he knew . Karen put a bottle of champagne into the refrigerator and reached for the telephone . Cheryl was almost as excited as she was , but she reluctantly refused Karen 's invitation to supper . " I 've got a class . I do n't dare skip it , there 's a test tonight . Unless  --  would it be all right if I came over afterwards ? I could be there by nine , unless you 're set on getting drunk right this min-ute . " " I think I can hold off for a few hours , " Karen admitted . After inspecting the larder , she decided there was nothing on hand worthyof the occasion . Snatching her purse , she ran out to shop , treatingp130herself to veal chops ( two very small chops ) from the Georgetown Market . She did not buy Alexander 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell the difference between supermarket fare and that of a French butcher , but she did not count on it . Cheryl arrived at 9:10 , brandishing a bottle . " I figured one bottle of champagne was n't enough for your first big sale . Let 's open it right this minute . " They drank with simulated solemnity  --  " to Miriam and her millions . " Karen filled the glasses again . " I 'd like to propose another toast . Feel free to throw the wine and the glass out the window if you hate the idea , but . . . How about drinking to our new partnership ? " Cheryl stopped with her glass halfway to her lips . She stared at Karen ; then her eyes suddenly brimmed with tears . " I thought you 'd never ask , " she said . AT midnight they were halfway through the second bottle and neither one of them had stopped talking . " Might as well finish it , " Cheryl said seriously , pouring the wine . " It 'd be a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the greatest business brains in the state  --  " " This is n't a state , " Karen said , with only the slightest difficulty over the sibilants . " And a damn shame , too , " Cheryl cried . " Here 's to self-gov'ment for the District of Columbia ! " " Right on ! " " No , but I mean we are the best business brains in whatever it is , " Cheryl insisted . " Do you realize that in the last three hours we 've figured out everything we 're gon na do , even the way we 're gon na decorate the shop ? " " We have n't got the shop yet . " " But I 'm gon na start looking tomorrow . In all those places we talked about . You know , this town closes down and dies in August , after Congresslets out . My classes are over the end of July , and soon as your friend gets back you can give her your notice and work at this full-time . " " I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one another , at once sobered and exhilarated by the prospect . " I really think we can do it , Cheryl . "  | " Sure we can do it . You know , Karen , you do n't know what this means t'me . I ca n't tell you  --  " " You did tell me . About ten times . " " An ' I 'll say it ten more times , " Cheryl declared . " Ca n't say it too often . " For some reason this struck both of them as hilariously funny , and they laughed until they were breathless . " We 're drunk , " Karen said , in surprise . " Maybe you are , but I 'm not . I 'm just a little tipsy . Here we go  --  this is the last . A final toast ? " " To us , " Karen said . " Couldn't 've said it better myself . " They had retired to Karen 's room to inspect the merchandise and go over the books . " I tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You better not go home in that condition . Oh , I know you are n't drunk . But neither of us is exactly sober , now are we ? Why do n't you spend the night ? " " Okay , " Cheryl agreed . " I better call Mark . Ask him if I can spend the night . " " What do you mean , ask him ? " " You 're right , you 're right . Do n't ask him  --  tell him . Only . . . " Cheryl'smouth drooped . " Only I do n't have my toothbrush or my nightie . " " No problem . Ruth is one of those perfect hostesses who always has extra toothbrushes for guests . And if you want a nightgown  --  " Karen walked , none too steadily , to the wardrobe and threw open the door . " Take your pick . Victorian with handmade eyelet ruffles , Edwardian with pin tucks and tatting , bias-cut peach satin  --  " " What , wrinkle the merchandise ? " Cheryl 's eyes widened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , better call of Mark . " Cheryl pulled herself together enough to sound relatively coherent when she announced to her brother that she would not be home that night . Karen , preparing Ruth and Pat 's room for a guest , overheard enough to deduce that Mark had been properly congratulatory about the partnership and rather pleased than otherwise that he would not have to deal with a giggling , tipsy sister . After she had tucked her new partner into bed , Karen went downstairs to let Alexander out . It was not until she looked into the darkened garden that she remembered her ghost . " Nothing like cash in hand to scare away spooks , " she thought with a smile as she called Alexander in , checked the doors and windows , and went up to bed.  | " Karen ! Karen ! " Muzzy with sleep and champagne , it took her a while to recognize the voice . She struggled to sit up , muttering , " Whazzamatter ? " Cheryl stood in the doorway , silhouetted against the light from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older , more tattered nightgowns ; it was too big for her and puddled around her bare feet . " What 's the matter ? " Karen repeated . " There was somebody in my room . " The only body in Cheryl 's room belonged to Alexander , who was engaged in a thorough sniff of every corner . Someone had certainly been there , however , or else Cheryl was guilty of walking in her sleep . The wardrobe doors were flung wide , and most of the clothes had been removed from the hangers . " What happened ? " Karen gasped , reaching for some of the garments that littered the floor . Cheryl caught her arm . " Do n't touch anything yet . Did you feel a draft when we came through the hall ? " They stared at one another . Then Karen ran for the stairs , with Cheryl close behind . The draft of air became stronger as they descended . Karen heard Cheryl stumble and swear as Alexander scooted between her legs . He passed Karen , tumbled down the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving a right-angle turn and vanishing in the direction of the kitchen . When Karen reached the room he was gone . The back door stood wide open . She stopped to catch her breath , and Cheryl caught up with her . " For God 's sake , Karen , wait a minute . You do n't know what the hell is out there . " Clinging to one another , they ventured cautiously out the door and onto the terrace . A faint , far-off rumble of thunder shivered in Karen 's ears , and a gust of wind hot as a breath from an inferno stirred her hair . There was a storm brewing ; but the stars overhead were still bright , and a sliver of moon hung low in the sky . The white forms crowding the garden shone faintly in the starlight , stirring feebly like victims of a massacre who had been thrown in broken , distorted attitudes across the bushes . A limp sleeve fluttered , as if in a last futile appeal for help . They got the clothes in before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in time ; the electricity went out soon after the kettle had boiled . The telephone was also dead . They sat at the kitchen table with candlelight throwing gruesome shadows across their strained faces.  | " I should n't have shut Alexander in with me , " Karen reproached herself . " When I think what could have happened  --  " Cheryl was equally angry with herself . " Lord knows how long he was in there rummaging around before I woke up . If only I had n't had so damned much to drink ! " " Thank God you did . If you had screamed , or made a sudden move . . . " She could n't finish the sentence , or decide what horrified her more  --  the thought of what the intruder might have done to Cheryl , or Cheryl 's appalling nonchalance . " Try the phone again , Karen , " Cheryl urged . " The storm seems to be letting up . " " I 'm not sure I want to call the police . " Cheryl 's jaw dropped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's just it . It is n't the second time I 've complained to the police , it 's the third ; and it would be the fourth if I had reported what happened last night . . . Damn . I 'm so shaken up I ca n't keep my mouth shut . I was n't going to tell anyone about that . " " Well , you 'd damned well better tell me . Honestly , Karen , I ca n't figure you out . You 're too brave for your own good . What happened last night ? " Karen hoped Cheryl would laugh at the bed sheet incident . She did n't laugh . " There 's something funny going on , all right , " she said soberly . " All the more reason why you should notify the police . " " But do n't you see , they 're going to get sick of hearing from me ! They get calls all the time from nervous women who think there are burglars under the bed  --  " " Men , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tony told me about some screwball who is convinced aliens from outer space are tapping his phone . What does that have to do with you ? You are n't imagining things . I saw what happened tonight  --  " " You did have a lot to drink tonight . I could have crept into your room and cleaned out the wardrobe  --  done all the rest of it  --  before I went back upstairs and made noises to waken you . " Cheryl studied her gravely . " You 're your own worst enemy , Karen . It'sas if you were still blaming yourself for everything that happens to you . You ca n't just sit here wringing your hands and letting people hassle you . " " You think that 's the motive behind all this ? " " I do n't know . It does n't make sense . I guess I do n't have the right to boss you around , but . . . " " You want me to call the police . " " I sure as hell do . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in that merchandise . "  |p134It  was late morning before an officer finally arrived in response to the call they made after the storm had ended and telephone service had been restored . The bad weather had produced flooding and innumerable minor traffic accidents , and he was obviously in no mood to sympathize with their complaint . One of the first things he did was scold them for dis turbing the scene of the crime . " What were we supposed to do , leave the door wide open with a thunderstormgoing on ? " Cheryl demanded , looking like an indignant hen with her ruffled yellow curls and bright eyes . " Let the clothes get soaked ? They 're our merchandise ! " The officer looked with polite incredulity at the limp blue negligee she was waving at him . " If you say so , ma'am . But there 's not much I can do except file a report . " After he had gone , Karen could not resist . " What did I tell you ? " " We did the right thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go back to bed for a few hours ? " " Who , me ? I 'm going to Gaithersburg to see that realtor . " " What realtor ? " " Anyone I can find . We talked about it last night , remember ? Or have you changed your mind ? " " About the shop ? Of course not . I thought perhaps you might have had second thoughts . " " Me ? Why ? " " I would n't blame you , after last night . " " Oh , that . " Cheryl grinned , obviously relieved . " What 's a partner for ? " " A partner is n't obliged to set herself up as a sitting duck . " " I 'm no sitting duck , " Cheryl stated , her jaw protruding . " I may not bebig , but I 'm tough . I 've taken a few karate lessons , and I 'm a dead shot . " " I fondly hope those skills wo n't be required . " " Back where I come from , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? " " I think Pat did have a gun , once upon a time . He kept it in the drawer of his bedside table . " " There 's no gun there now . Not if that 's the room I slept in ; I opened the drawer this morning , looking for tissues . " " Then it must be somewhere else  --  or he got rid of it . I know Ruth never liked having it around . Cheryl , what are you getting at ? " " Why , I 'm going to move in with you , " Cheryl said calmly . " Unless you object , that is . " " But  --  " " I wo n't be any trouble . I 'll do the cooking and the cleaning , and we'rep135going to be so busy getting the shop started that I 'd be here a lot of the time anyway . " " You do n't have to sell yourself . But  --  " " Mark does n't really need me . He only asked me to move in as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending he 's too busy to do much entertaining . Can I have a key ? " " There are extras on the hall table . But  --  " " But me no buts . You 'd better get dressed . Did n't you say you had an appointment with a lawyer this morning ? I 'll feed Alexander and lock up before I leave . Hurry , you 're going to be late . " Karen started up the stairs , feeling as if she had been adopted by some strong-minded female head of state who combined the motherly concern of a kindly old lady with the role of general in chief of the armed forces . On the whole , she thought she was going to like it . ROB was late to work again . When Karen spoke to him about it , he replied with poorly concealed insolence and retreated to the office . Could Rob be the one responsible for what appeared to be a deliberate campaign of petty persecution ? He had the right personality traits ; he was eccentric , small-minded , and capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretended to be airily amused by Julie 's refusal to leave him in charge , but perhaps he resented the person who had , as he believed , replaced him in Julie 's trust . Karen dealt with a minor flurry of customers and then sat down with the petticoat she was altering . Rob 's temper had improved ; she could hear him crooning to himself from the office , where he was supposedly unpackingchina . He only hummed when he was in a good mood . Was he looking forward to another conquest that night or congratulating himself on anothertrick successfully carried out ? She was holding the petticoat up to make sure she had not missed any rents when Rob came out of the office . " Mmm , yummy , " he remarked . " I know a little lady who 'd look gorgeousin that . Want me to steer her in ? For the usual commission , of course . " " It 's already spoken for , " Karen said . " That 's why I brought it in ; I told the buyer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p136There  was no reason why she should n't tell him , so she did . Rob clucked appreciatively . " You 're really making a killing at this , are n't you , duckie ? " " I 'll be happy if I can make a modest living . " " ' Twill be more than modest if you go on as you began . Who 's the buyer , one of your rich friends from Middleburg ? " " I do n't have any rich friends , " Karen said shortly . " If you are referring to Mrs. Montgomery , she 's only an acquaintance and  --  I hope  --  a good customer . " Realizing that her tone had been repressive , she tried to make amends . There was no sense in irritating people needlessly . " She would n't buy anything like this . It 's the young girls who go for the Victorian whites . " " Well , I 'm sure it 's just terribly fascinating , but I 'm glad I do n't have to worry about pin tucks and edging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a snack . Can I bring you anything ? " Karen declined with thanks and a pleasant smile . Her customer came while Rob was out ; the remodeled petticoat was a perfect fit , and after the girl left , Karen studied the check with a satisfaction she had not felt even with Miriam 's extravagant purchase . This money represented almost pure profit , for the petticoat was one she had found in old Mrs. Ferris ' motley collection , and its pristine perfection was due to her own labors . Few people would have given it a second glance in its original condition . Rob returned with an ice cream cone wrapped in a paper doily , which he presented with a bow . " Champagne ice , " he announced . " Just the thing for you . " " Why ? " Karen asked in surprise . Rob 's blue eyes widened . " To celebrate your sale , duckie . What else ? I 'm too poor to go for the bottled bubbly . " Karen laughed and thanked him and reminded herself she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks . But her annoyance revived when Rob appeared shortly thereafter wearing a blue silk shirt that set off his eyes . " You do n't mind if I leave a bit early , " he announced breezily . " Heavy date tonight  --  and I do mean , my dear , hea-vy ! " The chimes above the door tinkled mockingly as he opened it . " I may be late getting in tomorrow , " Karen said . " Will you be sure  --  " " But of course , darling . " Rob 's teeth shone like ivory . " That 's fine with me . Be as late as you like . " He really is a maddening little bastard , Karen thought . Neither the adjective nor  --  as far as she knew  --  the noun was strictly accurate ; but one tended to think of Rob as little , despite his inches . It was descriptive of his personality , anyway . But she could hardly scold him for taking time off just before she announced she intended to do the same . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in her search for a suitable location . Cheryl was right , that was really the first order of business upon which everything else depended , and the sooner they got at it , the better . When Cheryl called later that afternoon it was to announce that she had found several likely prospects , but that she thought they ought to look farther . " I 'll tell you about them tonight . I 'm at home now , packing my things ; okay if I go right to the house ? " " Yes , fine . " " Are you very tired ? " " Why ? Are there some places we could inspect this evening ? " " Well , not exactly . We 've been invited to dinner . I said I 'd let him know . That maybe you were too tired after last night . " " Him , " Karen repeated . " You told Mark what happened ? " " Was n't I supposed to ? " Cheryl asked innocently . " Oh , it does n't matter . " Cheryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really pleased about the partnership . That 's why he 's taking us to dinner , to celebrate . " " It 's very nice of him , " Karen said dryly . " Would you mind if Tony joined us ? " " Of course not . " " Good . I 'll tell him . See you later . " She hung up before Karen could answer . So Cheryl had barely waited till her back was turned before running to her brother for help and sympathy . The fact that Karen felt a sneaking , cowardly sense of relief at Mark 's involvement only made her angrier , not with Cheryl but with herself . She should never have agreed to letting Cheryl move in with her . It was tantamount to inviting a friend to join you in a cage of lions . Or perhaps a cage of rats  --  the attacks thus far had been more frightening than physically dangerous , but part of the terror was not knowing precisely what threatened her , or why . Naturally Mark was concerned about his sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; including Tony Cardoza in the party gave Mark 's true motive away . She and Cheryl were about to attend anothermeeting of the Murder Club . Only this time , instead of idly arguing about classic crimes , the two men would be discussing a real case . It was probably the sort of case Mark would relish if Cheryl were not involved . He had undoubtedly tried to talk her out of staying in a house where so many peculiar , possibly threatening , things had happened . He had failed , of course . Cheryl was as stubborn as she was loyal . What else could Mark do but take all possible steps to protect his sister ? I should n't let her do it , Karen thought . But how can I prevent her ? Especially when I do n't want to prevent her.  |p138KAREN  closed a few minutes after five , practically pushing a last lingering customer out the door . The woman had been in the shop for half an hour and obviously had no intention of buying anything ; she was just killing time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but she arrived soon afterward , by cab , with several suitcases . " I left the car for Mark , " she explained . " He said he 'd pick us up about six-thirty . " While she waited , Karen had tried to summon up courage enough to tell Cheryl she had changed her mind . Though she paced up and down rehearsingdifferent approaches , she could n't find one that sounded convincing . If she denied being afraid , Cheryl would tell her she ought to be . If she admitted she was terrified at the idea of staying alone , Cheryl would be all the more determined to stick to her side . And she could n't bring herself to admit the truth  --  that she did not want to be obligated , even indirectly , to a man who had been forced , against his will and his wishes , into the conventional role of male protector by her friendship with his sister . He might even think she had encouraged that friendship in order to see more of him . She had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did n't matter ; Cheryl never gave her a chance to introduce it . She talked steadily while they showered and dressed , with only a few brief interruptionsas she dashed in and out of the bathroom . " . . . the one in Pooles/ville is kind of cute . Cheap , too . But it needs a lot of work , and I think we 'd be better off in an area that already has some craft and antique shops . Not New Market or Alexandria , rents are too high , but maybe Kensington or Falls Church . Suppose we try Virginia tomorrow . There 's a town in Prince William County . . . . " Karen gave up  --  at least for the present . She decided defiantly that she might as well enjoy her evening out , a rare chance to wear pretty clothes and dine at a nice restaurant with two good-looking men . Even if both of them were more interested in burglars than in her . It had been Cheryl 's idea that they model some of their merchandise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Karen , especially to someplacefanc3rsi told Mark he had to pick the best restaurant in town . " Karen hut , agreed , primarily because she had nothing else suitable . Never again would she appear in public wearing the disastrous silk dress Jack had called homemade . If she could ever afford a cleaning woman , she would emulate Mrs. Mac and give the dress away . She had selected a dress from the thirties that hung straight from the shoulders to the irregular , calf-length hemline . Its chiffon skirts were frosted with overlapping rows of black sequins and tiny rhinestones . She was struggling with the snap fasteners along the side when Cheryl came in . " Oh , Karen , you look sensational ! Here , let me do that . " While Cheryl coped with the snaps , Karen studied her reflection in the mirror . It was certainly a considerable improvement over the one she had seen a few weeks earlier . She looked thinner , but that might be the dress ; black is notoriously slimming . The greatest change was in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheryl 's breathless compliment . The shadow girl was laughing too ; but now there was no mockery in her smile . " Do n't you think the dress is too stagy ? " Karen asked doubtfully . " You can look at me and say that ? " Cheryl struck a pose . She was wearing a strapless fifties prom dress with a bouffant net skirt , in which she looked no more than eighteen . " Anyhow , " she went on , " that 's just how we want to look . Eye-catching . Stand up straight . Throw your shoulders back . That 's better . " Mark arrived promptly at six-thirty , wearing a conservative dark suit and tie . After explaining that Tony had been delayed and would meet them at the restaurant , he examined his sister and broke into rude , uninhibited laughter . " What are you supposed to be , the sweetheart of Sigma Chi ? " " Sneer all you want , " said Cheryl , unperturbed . " Do I look cute or do n't I ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that 's a compliment . . . "  | " Now tell Karen how gorgeous she is . " Karen stiffened self-consciously as Mark gave her the same careful inspectionhe had given Cheryl . " She 's beautiful . Even more beautiful than . . . " He checked himself and then went on smoothly , " . . . than Mrs. Mac when she wore that dress . Ever see pictures of her when she was young ? You would n't call her beautiful , but she was a knockout in her own way . " He turned away to help his sister with her wrap . The quintessential politician , Karen thought sourly . The compliment had n't ended the way she expected ; she only hoped her expression had not betrayed her feelings . She wondered how he had known the dress was one of Mrs. MacDougal 's . It was hardly likely that she had shown it to him . Perhaps she had worn it in one of the pictures he had mentioned . Or perhaps he had simply assumedit had been hers , after hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant was new to Karen  --  not surprisingly , since fads in eating places came and went in Washington  --  but Cheryl nodded approvingly . " Good choice , my boy . It 's one of the in ' places . We 'll be seen by everybody who is anybody . Too bad we do n't have our cards printed , Karen , we could pass them out to people . " " That would be just dandy for my image , " said Mark . " I 've got trouble enough being seen in public with somebody who looks like Debbie Reyn-olds . " They did attract a few stares as the headwaiter led them to a table . Its position was indicative of Mark 's status as a fledgling Congressman  --  not one of the cozy banquettes that were reserved for real celebrities , but in a location where they could see and be seen . " We may as well order , " Mark said , after they had been seated . " No sense waiting for Tony ; he never knows when he can get away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cheryl said . " Murder ? " Karen repeated . " Let 's hope it 's just a nice harmless breakingand entering . " " No , it would be murder , " Cheryl said absently , her attention fixed on the menu . " That 's Tony 's job  --  homicide . " Karen was content to drop the subject . Cheryl did most of the talking . Descriptions of the properties she had inspected carried them through the cocktails , and she had just launched into an animated lecture on bookkeeping methods when the appetizers arrived . She stopped talking and inspected her oysters on the half shell with visible disgust . " I do n't know why you order oysters when you hate them , " Mark said , spearing one and swallowing it.  | " They 're classy . Besides , this way you can eat twice as many . Lookis n't that the TV announcer  --  Channel 4  --  I forget his name  --  " " Quit staring , " Mark ordered . " That definitely is not classy . " " Someone 's waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see who . . . Oh ! " The sudden change in her voice would have been amusing if she had not been so visibly embarrassed . Mark was not embarrassed  --  when had Mark ever been ?  --  but the rising tide of color in his face betrayed his annoyance with his sister  --  not because she had pointed Shreve out , but because her exaggerated reaction underlined a situation that could , and should , have been passed off as a casual social encounter . On a sudden impulse , Karen waved back . The look of surprised indignationon Shreve 's face pleased her enormously . " There 's Tony , " Mark said with relief . " It 's about time . " Theirs were not the only eyes that followed Cardoza 's progress across the room . Again Karen was struck by his astonishing good looks . His colleagues must kid him unmercifully about being so beautiful . " Sorry I 'm late , " he said , pulling out a chair . " A policeman 's lot . . . " " Bad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain on Tony 's face were visible to all of them . " Yeah . " Though Mark was obviously curious , he took the hint . " Drink up , then . You 're behind . " " I 'll stick to wine , thanks . Have to toast the new enterprise . " After Tony had ordered he leaned back and smiled at them . " This is a pleasant change from my usual stale sandwiches and TV dinners . If you had told me the ladies were going to be so dolled up , I 'd have gotten my tux out of mothballs . " " Just do n't mention the sweetheart of Sigma Chi , " Cheryl warned him . " You look cute . " " Thanks for nothing . " The affectionate older-brother smile Tony had given Cheryl faded as he turned his attention to Karen . After a moment he said unexpectedly , " She walks in beauty , like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies . . . . ' " Karen felt her cheeks grow warm . She could think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so obviously sincere . How long had it been , she wondered , since she had blushed at hearing the open admiration in a man 's voice ? Mark broke the silence . " If there is anything more revolting than a literary cop  --  "  |p142Tony  grinned . " Hey , pal , if you ca n't hack it , do n't knock it . Here 's luck to the lovely lady , and her partner , and their business . " He raised his glass . " Thanks , " Karen said . " We 're going to need it . " " Especially if people keep messing up the merchandise , " Cheryl added . " We 've washed and ironed some of those nightgowns twice in two days . " Her blue eyes widened innocently as she spoke , but as Karen had realized , her new partner was not as ingenuous as she appeared . Cheryl did not believe in wasting time , or resources . To her surprise , Karen found that her initial reluctance to imposing on Mark  --  and Tony  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , of course . Neither man appeared averse to discussing the matter . In fact , Mark looked more alert than he had all evening . " That 's one explanation , " he said . " Have you got a jealous rival , la-dies ? " " A couple of dozen rivals , I guess , " Cheryl answered . " But if someone is trying to discourage us they 're going about it the wrong way . It will take more than a little washing and ironing to stop us . " " If the low-down rat knew what a menace you are when you 're riled up , he would n't mess with you , " Tony said , smiling at Cheryl . " I agree with you . Anyone who wanted to put you out of business would burn or destroy your stock . There 's something else involved . Karen , can you think of anyone who might have a grudge against you ? " " No . Tony , I appreciate your concern  --  and Mark 's  --  but we do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'm sure you are very , very sick of crime . " " Honey , this is n't a crime . " The endearment slipped out smoothly and naturally ; Tony appeared not to notice he had said it . " Not the kind I 'm accustomed to deal with daily , at any rate . It 's more like an interesting little problem . " " A case for the Murder Club ? " Karen asked with a twist of her lip . " Oh , hey , " Tony said quickly . " Do n't get the idea that this is just an academic exercise for me . It might be if I had read about it or heard about it . But when it happens to someone I know and like . . . You are n't going to tell me to stay out of it , I hope ? " " I 'm very grateful , " Karen said quietly . " There 's nothing to be grateful about . That 's just the point . No serious crime has been committed , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . This looks like a case of simple harassment . It may not even be directed against you personally . Kids playing tricks , picking a victim at random  --  " " Trying to strangle someone is a hell of an unfunny joke , " Mark said . " Shut up and let me be the detective . That 's what they pay me for , youp143know . The first incident may or may not be connected with the others . Whether or not , it 's obvious that the guy was not lying in wait for Karen ; he was caught by surprise , and lost his head . As for the enterprising young man who made off with Mrs. MacDougal 's car  --  I 'm sure you thought you recognized him , Karen , but we have a reliable report of his being seen in Cleveland . It 's his home town and he is not unknown to the police there . " He smiled at Karen , who shrugged resignedly . If he was trying to prove that he knew all about her recent adventures , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been mistaken about Horton . " The next episode is particularly interesting , " Tony went on . " We might call it the ghost in the garden . ' A bed sheet is certainly a weird dis-guise  --  " " It 's a damned good disguise , " Mark broke in . " It conceals not only the face but all other identifying characteristics , even height and build . I admit a person wearing it would be somewhat conspicuous out on the street , but in a secluded back garden nothing could be better , and once he leaves the premises he can just roll it up and carry it under his arm . What 's suspiciousabout dirty laundry ? " " Okay , okay . The trouble with you , Mark , is that you talk too much . I still think the bed-sheet disguise suggests someone 's peculiar idea of a joke . And a pretty childish joke at that  --  I mean , who in this day and age believes in the old-fashioned sheeted specter ? We 've seen too many special effects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive . Hell , if I decided to play ghost , I could come up with a much more ingenious costume . " " I 'll bet you could , " Cheryl said . " Which is precisely my point , " Mark insisted . " It was n't meant to frighten Karen . . . . You were n't frightened , were you ? " " Who , me ? " Karen gave a hollow laugh . " Well , I do n't mind admitting I 'd have been scared to death , " Cheryl announced . " Seeing something like that , in half-fog , half-darkness . . . . You big brave heroes can jeer all you want , but I 'll bet you 'd have been shocked out of your socks too  --  at least for a few seconds . " " Exactly , " Mark said triumphantly . " Those few seconds could make the difference between capture and escape . " " I do n't know what the devil we 're arguing about , " Tony said . " There was no danger to Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night 's , is a little more serious . The joker actually got into the house . Now are you girls absolutely certain you locked up ? I got the impression you were both a little  --  well  --  " " You have a lot of nerve calling us drunks , " Cheryl exclaimed  | " I did n't say you were drunk , I implied you were careless . Did you lock all the doors and windows ? " " Certainly , " Cheryl said loftily . " I 'm sure , " Karen said . " Well  --  ninety-nine percent sure . " " You 'd better be a hundred percent sure , " Tony said soberly . " Because if you did lock up , it means your visitor has a key to the house . " " Or that there is a way in we do n't know about , " Mark said . " Come off it , " Tony grunted . " Next thing you 'll be talking about secret passages . Look , ladies , I 'm not trying to cast aspersions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone could have a key . You just had new locks installed , did n't you ? So . The next question is , did anyone know Cheryl was staying overnight ? " " No , " Cheryl said without hesitation . " It was a last-minute decision . 1 did n't know myself until after midnight . " " You did n't call Mark ? " " Well , of course . You know I did . " " Just a damned minute , " Mark said . " Are you suggesting  --  " " I am trying to conduct a proper interrogation , " Tony said . " And I 'm having a hell of a hard time doing it . Did you tell anyone Cheryl was going to be at Karen 's ? " Mark 's cheeks darkened . " What do you think , that I called everybody 1 know to tell them the cat 's away and now little brother can play ? " " I do n't know what you 're so uptight about , " Tony said in an aggrieved voice . " Relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in that room and in that bed was known only to Cheryl and Karen . " " Oh . " Mark sat back . " Nobody knew , " Cheryl said . " For goodness ' sakes , you men make such a fuss about the simplest things . " " So , " Tony continued doggedly , " the guy went into what he assumed was an empty room . He opened the wardrobe . He probably got the shock of his life when Cheryl started stirring and mumbling . He ran  --  with an armful of clothes . Now if he was startled , scared , he might have held on to them for a second or two . But why did n't he drop them on the stairs or in the hall ? Why carry them out to the garden and spread them around ? Why bother with a lot of rags in the first place ? " " They are n't rags , " Cheryl said indignantly . " They are valuable  --  " " Yeah , sure , so you keep telling me . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A couple of hundred bucks ? A couple of thousand ? " " Closer to a hundred thousand , " Karen said . " What ? " Tony was obviously taken aback . " I 've never really thought of it in those terms , " Karen said slowly . " But I have  --  oh , thirty or forty of Mrs. Mac 's dresses . They are n't all designerp145originals , and their value varies a lot ; but when you consider that a Poiret evening dress sold at Christie 's in 1981 for fifty-five hundred dollars  --  " " Five thousand bucks for a dress ? " Tony exclaimed incredulously . " Some are worth more , " Karen assured him . " Some less , of course . . . . I almost wish you had n't brought it up , Tony . I guess I do n't have the mercantile mentality . " " That 's what I 'm supposed to be contributing to this partnership , " Cheryl sputtered . She smacked herself on the forehead with the flat of her hand . " Insurance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that ? First thing tomorrow  --  " " Hold it , " Tony said . " I 'm glad I reminded you of your forgotten duties , kid , but we 're wandering off the subject . I did n't realize  --  " " Throws your theory into a cocked hat , does n't it , buddy ? " said Mark with a mocking smile . " What about yours , buddy ? " " Does n't affect mine . " Mark leaned back and folded his arms . He obviously wanted someone to ask him what his theory was . No one obliged . Tony swallowed , pondered for a moment , and then said firmly , " No , it does n't have anything to do with what I was thinking . Because the clothes were n't stolen . They were arranged  --  deliberately arranged  --  around the garden . That reminded me of something . I 'm surprised it did n't strike you , Mark . " " You mean the Stratford case , " Mark said . " Uh  --  right . " Tony looked crestfallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Cheryl . " It happened in 1850 , in Connecticut . Started with the standard poltergeist phenomena : objects flying through the air , fires breaking out with no apparent cause . But there was one unusual feature . One day when the family came home from church they found a lot of their clothes in the parlor , stuffed with pillows and arranged in strange positions , like dummies in a tableau . One was kneeling in front of an open Bible . " When he had finished , there was a profound silence that lasted until the waiter had removed the plates and requested their choice of dessert . " I 'm having those little cream puffs with chocolate sauce , " Cheryl said . " Tony , are you out of your mind ? " " You do n't get it , " Tony said . " No , thanks , no dessert for me . " " Nor me , " Karen said . " I 'm afraid I do n't get it either . " But it had been a curiously disturbing image and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before  --  the white shapes fallen in helpless abandon , like victims of a massacre . " This is serious , Tony , " Cheryl said reproachfully . " And you start ramblingon about haunted houses and poltergeists ! "  |p146Tony  glanced at Mark , who was not trying to conceal his amusement . " I 'm not rambling on about poltergeists , " he said , in the strangled voice of a man who is controlling his temper under extreme provocation . " I do n't believe in poltergeists . Everything has a rational explanation , including the Stratford case . The dummies were set up by someone  --  " " Everyone in the household was in church , " Mark said gently . " Includingthe servants . They alibied each other . " " Then they lied , or they were misled , " Tony said . " There was malice in that case , and that 's the motive here too . The parallels  --  " " Are purely coincidental , " Mark said . He was no longer smiling . " The motive in this case is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't imagine why the rest of you do n't see it . Somebody wants something Karen has . It 's that simple . " " Ruth 's silver , " Karen began . " Her antiques  --  " " Not Ruth , you . This nonsense did n't begin until you started collecting old clothes . " Karen laughed . " Are you suggesting a competitor is trying to steal my stock ? The most valuable things have n't even been touched , much less taken . Or maybe it 's someone who has a mania for dressing up in antique women 's clothing . " Mark looked thoughtful . " I had n't thought of that one . " " But I 'll bet you 've thought of things that are just as far-out , " Tony jeered . " A will in the pocket of an old coat ? A diamond bracelet some woman just happened to forget she had left in her purse ? " Cheryl began waving her hands . " He 's right , but he 's all wrong , " she said excitedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do n't forget the trouble began the day we went to the auction . And what happened at the auction . " Mark had obviously heard all about Mrs. Grossmuller . He let out a whoop of laughter . " I suppose the old lady stitched a confession of murder into her wedding dress  --  thirty years before she bumped the judge off . " That ended any hope of a sensible discussion . Even Tony got carried away ; it was he who postulated a treasure map embroidered onto a tablecloth . Paste gems that were n't paste but genuine , diamonds disguised as buttons  --  they covered the gamut of absurd theories . They were laughing over Karen 's suggestion  --  a lost Edgar Allan Poe manuscript cut up and used to line a lady 's bodice  --  when a voice behind Karen said brightly , " I had to stop and say hello . " Tony was on his feet . Mark started to follow suit ; Shreve put her hand on his shoulder and held him in his chair . " Do n't get up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . So nice to see that you 're having an evening out , Karen . "  | " Like the maid , you mean ? " Karen turned . " Have you met everyone ? " She performed the introductions . Shreve nodded slightly at Cheryl  --  " I 've met Mrs. Reichardt "  --  but her eyes returned immediately to Cardoza . " Detective ? " " Yes , ma'am , " said Tony , trying to look stolid . " Charming , " Shreve murmured . " What a pretty dress , Karen . Is it for sale ? " " I 'm afraid it would n't suit you , " Karen said . " But if you are interested in a dress , come by any time . All customers welcome . I 'll even take your personal check . " " How adorable of you . " Shreve 's hand moved from Mark 's shoulder to his cheek . She patted it gently . " Well , I 'll say good night . Do n't let this poor boy work too hard . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony critically , as Shreve joined the rest of her party . " Is that her husband ? " Cheryl asked , staring unabashedly . " No , " Mark said . " Does anyone want coffee ? " " At three bucks a cup ? " Tony shook his handsome head . " Now if someonewere to offer me a cup later , after I had escorted her home . . . " " Good idea , " Cheryl said . " And then you guys can help us look for the missing treasure . " " I was just kidding about that , " Tony protested . " I was n't . " Mark reached for the check . " I tell you , he 's looking for something . Do n't forget what he said to Karen . " " Where is it ? ' " Cheryl repeated . " I had forgotten that . I think you 're on to something , Mark . " Tony was not so easily convinced . Pressed by Mark , Karen was forced to admit that the idea was not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had heard of dealers finding old letters and diaries , even jewelry , in a bag or a pocket . They argued back and forth most of the way home , and in the end Tony grudgingly conceded that there was a possibility Mark was right . Only a possibility , though . " It will be like looking for a needle in a haystack , " he grumbled . " If the purported missing object were something obvious , you 'd have found it by now . You 've looked in the pockets and in the toes of the shoes ? " " I never thought about the shoes , " Karen said . " Oh , hell , " said Tony . They had reached the house ; Karen took out her key and inserted it in the lock . " Damn , " she said , twisting . " It sticks . " " Let me . " Mark unlocked the door . " Are n't you going to open it ? " Cheryl demanded . Mark stepped back . " You go first . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The dog , " Mark said simply . " This is my best suit . " Tony seemed equally disinclined to volunteer . With a scornful snit ! Cheryl opened the door and demonstrated her technique . After he had been tipped over , Alexander got to his feet and walked away with the abstracted air of a philosopher pondering one of the great universal ques tions . " I 've got to get out of this dress , " Cheryl announced , leading the way into the house . " It 's so tight I can hardly breathe . " " You ate too much , " her brother said rudely . " You ate my oysters . " " Oysters are n't fattening . What did it was that mountain of profiter-oles . " " I shall ignore that , " Cheryl said . " Should n't you change too , Karen ' ' Remember our rule : Do n't wrinkle the merchandise unnecessarily . " " I 'll make the coffee , " Mark said . " I take it the merchandise is upstairs ? Yell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This way , Tony . " Loosening his tie , he strolled toward the kitchen with the confidence of someone who knows his way around a house and feels at home there . Which of course he did , Karen thought . At one time he had been a frequentvisitor , welcomed with the total hospitality Pat extended to people he liked . Memories warm as summer and clear as actual sight filled her mind  --  Mark and Pat sitting in the kitchen , elbows on the table , sleeves rolled up , scattering crumbs and leaving beer and coffee stains on the cloth ; Ruth scolding both of them with affectionate impartiality as she mopped up the mess . . . . " Hey , Karen , " Cheryl called from the top of the stairs . " I need help with this zipper . " " Oh , yes . " Karen came back from ten years in the past . " Coming . " The search began with a certain amount of enthusiasm . Even Tony looked hopeful as he examined the shoes , most of which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tissue paper  --  but only with tissue paper . Mark seemed fascinated by the dresses . He kept repeating , " Five thousand dollars ? Five thousand ? " Finally Karen lost patience . " They are like any other kind of antique or collectible , Mark ; the price depends solely on what people are willing to pay . Here , give me that . You 're going to loosen the crystals pulling at them . " " I ca n't believe they are n't diamonds , " Mark said , giving up the dressone of Mrs. MacDougal 's more heavily beaded creations . " There 's nop149place to hide anything in these dresses  --  no pockets , no collars , no sleeves . " Tony 's interest had declined , but he stuck to the job , methodically examininghandbags and purses , feeling the linings to make certain they were Intact , turning them upside down and shaking them . " What 's this ? " Mark reached into the wardrobe and took out a small cream-colored box . Karen launched herself at him with a shriek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What the hell  --  " " That 's my Fortuny ! " " I do n't know what a Fortuny is , but I can assure you I was n't about to wipe the floor with it . " Karen peered cautiously into the box . " It 's one of his Delphos dresses . Nobody knows to this day how he got those tiny pleats , covering the entire garment . They had to be returned to him to be re-pleated , and they were sold in boxes  --  like this one  --  rolled and twined around like a skein of yarn . I was afraid you were going to take it out . I have n't dared touch it , because I know I 'd never get it back the way it was . " " How much ? " Tony asked , as Mark contemplated the small box with a mixture of disbelief and respect . " A couple of thousand  --  but that 's just a guess . As I told you , the price depends on the market at any given time . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " Mark said . " We wo n't unwind your Fortunato . " " Fortuny . " " Whatever . I trust this is n't another sacrosanct item ? " He took out a black velvet evening cloak and ran his hands over the fabric . " Hey  --  there 's a lump under here  --  " " That 's a shoulder pad , you oaf . " Cheryl snatched the cloak from him . " You 'd better leave this to us , Mark . You 're getting everything all wrinkled , and you do n't know anything about clothes . We 're more likely to notice something unusual than you . " " I 'm running out of steam , " Mark admitted . " And out of ideas . " He ran his hands through his rumpled hair . " What about that jewelry of Mrs. Mac 's , Karen ? " " How did you hear about that ? " Karen asked . " She told me she was going to give it to you , " Mark said readily . Apparently this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the latter demanded to know what they were talking about , soKaren explained , and brought out Dolley 's necklace and earrings . Thep150gleam in Tony 's eyes faded when he saw them , however . He shook his head . " No . " Karen was beginning to feel protective about poor Dolley 's jewels " What do you mean , no ? They are historic treasures . " " Maybe so , but they are n't worth much to your common garden-variet thief . I was expecting big shiny diamonds . " " I thought you were going to let Bates take charge of them , " Mark saidKaren repeated what she had told the lawyer . Her tone was aggressive , she rather expected Mark would tell her she was wrong , and demand that she put the jewelry in safekeeping . However , he nodded and said agreeably , " Right . It 's not a question of whether you have it , but whether someone thinks you have it . Why do n't you give me the case ? I 'll carry it conspicuously out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding it  --  " Tony hooted . " Drop-kick it into the street , maybe . Or I could go out for a pass . " Cheryl did n't smile . Karen could see that she too was disturbed by the suggestion that someone might be watching the house . She said sharply , " If you think we 're under surveillance , you had better take a couple of shopping bags too . We do n't know what this character wants . " " If anything , " Tony agreed . He yawned widely . " We 'll leave you ladies to your well-earned rest . I do n't admire your bedtime reading , though , Karen . Guaranteed nightmares . " He picked up the Georgetown legends book . Karen explained its presence , adding , " You know about it ? " " Oh , yeah . " Tony 's eyes twinkled . " The local precinct got a couple of calls from irate citizens . They wanted the author arrested . " " I would n't mind giving him or her a few swift kicks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt people . The one involving Mrs. Mac . . . " His thin lips curved in a reluctant smile . " She thought it was funny . Laughed till I was afraid she 'd choke . " " Can I read the book ? " Cheryl asked . " Help yourself . It 's only on my bedside table because I 've been too lazy to put it away . Maybe I had better get rid of it before Pat comes home ; he 's likely to go after the author with a horsewhip when he reads that libel about his mother . " " It 's not libel , " Tony said . " That 's why the author is safe from the heavy hand of the law . Most of the information comes from old newspaper sto ries and other published sources ; the rest is innuendo , and the author was smart enough to skirt the edge of the actionable . Besides , nobody seems to know who he is . " " Pat is just as likely to consider it the best joke since Watergate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Feel free to call at any hour , girls , if you find the diamonds . " " Do n't worry , " Cheryl said . " We will . " " Is someone going to escort us to the door ? " Mark inquired . Cheryl flatly refused , with a few pointed remarks about big strong menand little helpless dogs . Karen offered to do guard duty . Tony lingered ; she beard him say something to Cheryl , who replied with a peal of laughterand a comment whose tone was decidedly caustic . As they descended the stairs Karen said , " I 'm sorry you were dragged into this , Mark . It was n't my idea . " " I 'm sure it was n't . " " If you could persuade Cheryl to leave  --  " " No one can talk Cheryl out of , or into , anything . She 's a grown woman ; she makes her own decisions . " They had reached the door ; Mark turned to face her . " Are you seriously suggesting that I remove Cheryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some wandering lunatic  --  or that muscle-bound chauffeur whose pretty face you admire so much ? What kind of cold-blooded bastard do you take me for ? " His voice cut like a knife . Before Karen could reply , Tony came running down the stairs , and Mark turned away . Tony took Karen 's hand . " Thanks for an interesting evening . It is n't often I get a chance to search for lost diamonds and literary manuscripts . " Without turning , Mark opened the door . " If you 're going to start quotMg , keep it short and snappy , " he said , and went out , leaving them alone . " I want to hear the key turn and a lot of clattering of chains and bolts , " Tony said softly . " Not that I think there 's anything to worry about  --  " " I know . Thanks , Tony . " Abruptly he bent his head and touched her lips with his . Brief though it was , the kiss had nothing tentative about it ; the brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her body . Then he was gone , closing the door after him . She heard a soft voice say , " Locks . " Karen did as she was asked . There was no further comment from Tony . Peering through the spy-hole , she saw only his broad back , retreating . Mark was waiting for him on the sidewalk , strategically situated in the light of a street lamp . Karen 's view was limited and distorted , but as she watched she realized Mark was putting on the promised performance with the jewelry case . He did everything but drop-kick it , and although his gyrations were exaggerated to the point of farce , Karen was not particularlyamused . She made a detour into the kitchen and prepared a pot of tea . The rumble of Alexander 's snores followed her up the stairs ; really , shep152thought , there must be something wrong with his sinuses . Considering that his entire face was wildly out of sync , it would not be surprising . Cheryl looked up from the ledger she was inspecting and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hit the spot . Are you tired ? Want me to get out of here so you can go to bed ? " " I 'm still keyed up . I need to unwind . But if you 're sleepy  --  " " We 've got to stop being so damned polite , " Cheryl said . " To tell the truth , I 'm dying to go over your records . Unless you mind  --  " " Who 's being overly polite now ? I 'd be delighted to have you take over the damned books . I 'm absolutely hopeless about keeping records ; I keep forgetting to write things down . " Karen curled up in the chair Mark had occupied . " What I really want to do is sit here and watch you work . " " That 's right . You 're the artistic half of the team and I 'm the business end . " Cheryl frowned at one of the entries . " Did you itemize Mrs. MacDougal 's dresses ? All I can find is an entry that says , Misc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . I meant to do it right , only . . . " " You 've been distracted , " Cheryl said , with a wry smile . " Let 's start with the two dresses you sold that friend of yours . " After she had made the entry she asked , " When did you tell her you 'd have them ready ? " " I did n't . But we must get at it right away . Some of the beads are loose , and then they have to go to the cleaners ' . " " I 'll do that tomorrow afternoon . What cleaner do you use ? " " It 's someone Mrs. Mac recommended . What 's more , " Karen added , " I had to be recommended to him . He is not , if you please , taking new customers . But he knows how to handle delicate things . Be sure you explain to him  --  " " I get it . Throw Mrs. MacDougal 's name around and insist he handle these items personally . " " While you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took in a few days ago . I think the ticket is here somewhere . " Karen rummaged in her purse and finally came up with the receipt . " Be sure you keep track of the cost . And speaking of money  --  " " Why talk about something we do n't have ? " Cheryl grinned . " This is a hand-to-mouth operation , Karen . Sooner or later we 'll get a proper accountingsystem set up , but right now it 's grab it while you can . " Karen refused to be amused . " It 's going to be touch and go for a while , I know that . It looks as if I may have to take advantage of Pat 's offer and borrow from him until  --  and if  --  I can get a settlement from Jack . " " That 's right , you saw the lawyer today . I 'm sorry , Karen , I did n't even ask how it went . There was so much to talk about . "  | " He was nice . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendedhim . I 'm sure his fees are a lot less than Bates , Bates , and Whoever . But he was n't terribly encouraging . These things take time , said he profoundly  --  especially when , as seems evident , Jack is not inclined to be generous . Well , damn it , I do n't want generosity , I just want what 's fair . Lord knows I earned it . " " It 's definite , is it ? You are n't going to change your mind ? " " About the divorce ? Not on your life . Even if I were dumb enough tostick my head back in the noose , Jack would n't take me back . It was hisidea in the first place . " Cheryl studied her earnestly . " I 'm sorry if you are ; I 'm not sorry if you 're not . Do n't get me wrong ; I just would n't like to be left without a partner before we even get this show on the road . " " No fear of that . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still go on with the shop . I have to do it . It means a lot to me . Actually , I was about to ask you the same question . You 'll marry again one day  --  " " No . " " You may feel that way now , but  --  " " No . I 'm never going to get married again . " Her head was bent over the book , and her tumbled hair hid her face . After a moment Karen said gently , " How long has it been ? " " Two years . I know what you 're going to say . " Cheryl turned to face her , tossing her hair from her forehead . Her face bore an expression Karen had never seen on it before , a blend of dedicated exultation and of pain . " Everybody says the same thing . You 'll get over it , time heals all wounds . . . . But I wo n't . My life is n't ruined or anything like that . I 'm a very happy person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The flat finality of her voice would have forestalled argument , even if Karen could have thought of anything to say . She was astounded . To think that Cheryl , outwardly so cheerful and matter-of-fact , nourished this unrealistic , sentimental delusion . . . Karen had no doubt that it was a delusion . Love was not eternal , grief did not endure . " Men ( and women ) have died , and worms have eaten them , but not for love . " She was as convinced of those cliches as she was sure the sun would rise next morning . All the same , she felt a dull ache of envy . " I 'm so sorry , " she began . " I should n't have raised the subject  --  " " Oh , it 's just as well we got it out in the open , " Cheryl said calmly . " People are always trying to fix me up with other guys . It 's a waste of time ; you might as well know that from the start . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen stopped and bit her lip . " Tony is a good friend . "  | " He is also the best-looking man I 've ever seen . A real hunk , as they say . I wondered why you had n't mentioned that little detail . " " I guess he is handsome , " Cheryl said indifferently . " Joe was n't . I mean , most people would n't consider him good-looking . Tony likes you , Karen . I could tell . " " I 'm not so sure , " Karen murmured . She was seeing several things in a new light . " You 're the one who is likely to remarry . A beautiful , educated person like you  --  " " I doubt it . I did n't like being married . " The statement surprised her almost as much as it did Cheryl . " Really ? Was n't there anything  --  " " No . Now that I think about it , there was n't much about being married that I liked . I did n't own anything . Everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , food , the house , even my time . Jack 's work came first , and I got what was left over . " " Not all men are like that , " Cheryl said earnestly . " And there must have been something . . . . I mean , do n't you miss . . " Cheryl 's delicacy amused Karen . In her new role as partner she was trying to be more refined . " Sex ? Yes , I do miss it . But , to put it as nicely as possible , there was n't much to miss . " " That 's putting it nicely , all right . But I get the picture . You mean he ... " " I think the word would be competent , " Karen said musingly . " Marginallycompetent . It came as a shock too , I can tell you . He was very amorousbefore we got married . Once it was legal , he seemed to lose interest . " Cheryl let out a gurgle of laughter . " You 're funny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound much more insulting than if you 'd cut loose and used a lot of four-letter words . " " I should be ashamed of myself , " Karen said with a smile . " We 're alwayscomplaining about men thinking of women as sexual objects , and here I am doing the same thing . " " Was Mark . . . " Cheryl stopped with a gasp , and turned away . Karen had a glimpse of a beet-red , horrified face before Cheryl 's hair swung down to hide her features . " I 'm sorry , " said a muffled voice from behind the hair . " Me and my big mouth . I should have it amputated . " " Forget it . " Karen laughed and put an affectionate arm around Cheryl 's hunched shoulders . " This is like those old college bull sessions , where we all sat around and let our hair down . " " I never went to college , " Cheryl muttered . " I never finished . So what ? "  |p155Cheryl  looked up . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? I do n't want to know anyway . I mean , my own brother . . . He never told me any personal things , Karen . Honest . " " I said it 's all right . " Karen had no intention of answering the implied question . It had set off a sharp stab of memory that was humiliatingly physical in its intensity . " Was Mark . . . " Oh , he was , she thought . He certainly was . " We 'd better get to bed , " she said lightly . " We should be bright and sharp tomorrow for our session with the realtor . " " Right . Listen , how would you feel about a place with living quarters upstairs or at the back ? For us , I mean . I 'd pay a bigger share of the rent  --  " " Why should you pay more if we share . . . " Karen 's breath caught . " I 'm a selfish , thoughtless jerk . I keep forgetting about your little boy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about him all the time . " The words were quiet and unemotional , but they struck a chord that vibrated deep down in Karen 's very bones . Her fingers closed over Cheryl'sshoulder . " We 'll do it . Come hell or high water , burglars or bankruptcy , you 'll have him with you in time for kindergarten this fall . " It was an extravagant promise , a promise she had no right to make ; factors over which neither of them had any control could make it impossible to keep . But she was filled with shame at her selfishness . Preoccupied with her own emotional problems , she had failed to consider Cheryl 's . Yet who would have supposed that beneath the other woman 's smooth , bright facade there was a layer of sensibility as fragile , and as damaged , as the shattered silk lining of an antique garment ? She ought to have known , or at least suspected . Friendship deserved more than she had given.  |p156ELLS  CHURCH was , as Cheryl put it , a bust . The buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wrong area . They left their names with a realtor who promised to notify them if anything turned up and headed for home , feeling somewhat deflated . " We 've just begun , " Cheryl said consolingly . " Shall we have a quick look at Alexandria ? You never know . . . " Karen consulted her watch . " I 'm afraid there 's not time . Rob is totally unreliable , and I 'm going to be late as it is . " As matters turned out , she was even later than she had expected . They finally found a parking place several blocks from the house ; and as they approached it they saw something on the doorstep . It resembled a pile of rags rather than a human being , and Cheryl said pitifully , " Oh , it 's one of those poor old bag ladies , shopping bags and all . I feel so sorry for them . " " That 's no bag lady . " Karen came to a stop and clutched Cheryl . " That 's Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cheryl clutched back . They stood huddled together , staring , until Karen let out a nervous laugh . " What are we going to do ? We ca n't stand here like a couple of Victoriandamsels in distress . " " Let 's walk around the block . Maybe she 'll go away . " But Mrs. Grossmuller had seen them . Rising with monolithic dignity , she beckoned . She wore what must have been her " town " clothes  --  a rum/pled , tarnished black suit of decidedly antique vintage , and the most incrediblehat Karen had ever seen . It measured a good two feet across and was heaped with limp pink moire bows , with an almost naked ostrich feather crowning the pile . " Do n't laugh , " Karen said out of the corner of her mouth , as they obeyed the summons . " Laugh ? I 'm more likely to howl like Alexander . Why , hello there  --  Mrs. Grossmuller , is n't it ? " " I have been waiting a considerable time . " Mrs. Grossmuller brushed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her dignity was so extreme it was difficult not to apologize ; but Karen managed to refrain from doing so . Being at a loss for words , she fell back on the formula she used with customers . " Can I help you with anything ? " " Brought you some stuff , " said Mrs. Grossmuller , in one of her sudden descents from formal English to western Maryland accent and colloquialism . " You gon na ask me to come in or do you want I should dump it out on the sidewalk like a common vendor ? " She pushed past Karen as soon as the latter had unlocked the door , and Karen 's cry of warning came too late . " Watch out for the dog ! " Mrs. Grossmuller stood looking down at Alexander , who was squirming at her feet in unbecoming admiration . " Homely , ai n't he ? I guess that 's the homeliest dog I ever seen . " The insult did not affect Alexander in the least . He continued to grovel and Mrs. Grossmuller added grudgingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He likes you , " Karen exclaimed incredulously . " Most dogs do . Well ? Where 's the sitting room ? I could be persuaded to partake of a glass of sherry if it is not too sweet . " Mrs. Grossmuller got her sherry . She then spread her wares out across the furniture . They were n't quite as bad as Karen had feared , but they ran the gamut from a pair of pretty Victorian petticoats to faded calico aprons and sunbonnets . Some could never have fit Mrs. Grossmuller , at any stage in her life ; Karen deduced that she had been looting her neighbors ' attics , spurred on by her successful sale , and only hoped she had had their permission to do so . Being a receiver of stolen goods had a certain piratical ring to it when the stolen goods were gems and precious metals , but it would be demeaning to be arrested over a calico sunbonnet . For once it was she who had to put her foot down on the outlandish prices Mrs. Grossmuller asked . Cheryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing performance , seemed absolutely hypnotized . Her worst fears were uncalled for ; after a reasonable amount of dickeringMrs . Grossmuller accepted her offers and repacked the merchandisep158that had been rejected . " You 're smarter than I thought , " she remarked . " Could n't take you in . Figured it was worth trying , though . " She settled back with a pleased smile and thumbed through the money Karen had given her . " How did you find me ? " Karen asked . The answer was the one she expected . " Your address was on your check . I 'll bring you some more stuff another time . " " No , do n't do that , " Karen exclaimed . " I mean  --  I 'll be moving soon . " " Where ? " " I do n't know yet . Why do n't you give me your address and phone number and I 'll call you . " " Makes sense , " said Mrs. Grossmuller agreeably . She reached into her capacious purse . " My card . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frayed around the edges , but handsomely engraved . " Thank you , " Karen said . " Well . I 'll be in touch . " " Oh , I 'm not leaving yet , " said Mrs. Grossmuller , settling herself more comfortably . " You still got my wedding dress ? " " Uh  --  no . It 's not here . It 's  --  it 's at the cleaners ' . " " Oh . Too bad . I 'd have liked to look at it again . " Karen glanced at Cheryl , who was staring at Mrs. Grossmuller with the dumb fascination of a chicken under the cold , hypnotic gaze of a snake . She herself was conscious of a desire to burst into wild , uncontrolled shrieks of laughter . " I 'm sorry we ca n't ask you to stay , Mrs. Grossmuller . We are going out . " " When ? " " Right now , " Karen said firmly . " Oh . Well , I guess you could n't ask me to stay to lunch then . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omission . " Mrs. Grossmuller gathered up her shopping bags and rose , stepping carefully over Alexander , who was sprawled at her feet , licking her shoe . " I guess I 'll just hike down Wisconsin and look in the windows . Maybe have lunch out , seeing as I 'm so rich . Is there a McDonald 's around ? " Karen showed her out and then ran into the parlor , where she and Cheryl stood watching out the window , as Mrs. Grossmuller walked to a car parked  --  illegally  --  across the street , and got in . The vehicle swung abruptly out into the traffic , ignoring a Camaro that had to slam on its brakes to avoid a collision , and wove erratically away . " Are you all right ? " Karen asked , nudging her paralyzed partner . " Pinch me , " Cheryl gasped . " I do n't believe it . Did you see that car ? It was a Mercedes . And Alexander . . . She put a spell on him ! "  | " Cheryl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senile old woman . Why does she affect you that way ? " " Listen , I know a lot of senile old ladies . None of them acts like that . I ca n't help it . She gives me the creeps . Be honest , Karen ; what would you think if you woke up in the middle of the night and saw that face looking in your window ? " " I 'd think I was dreaming . She could n't get up to a second-story windowwithout a ladder  --  " " Or a broomstick , " Cheryl muttered . " I 'm sorry I ca n't stay and protect you from witches , but I 'm horribly late already . I have n't even time to change . Are you sure you wo n't be nervous ? " Cheryl gave herself a shake . " Do n't be silly . I 've got plenty to keep me busy . But I 'm going to lock all the doors . " " You do that . I wish I could stay and help you . Oh , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in a few days . " Julie was back sooner than that . Karen was not unduly surprised , though she was angry , to see that the shop was dark and that the grille across the door was still in place . Not until she started to unlock the padlock did she realize that although the hasp had been inserted into the hole , it had not been pushed home . " THIS is getting monotonous , " said Tony Cardoza . Hands on his narrow hips , he looked down at Karen , seated at Julie 's desk . " It 's not my fault , " Karen growled . " And if you 've called Mark . . . " " I have not called Mark . " Tony sat down on the corner of the desk . " Then do n't . I wo n't have him dashing to the rescue everytime somethinghappens . " Tony grinned and pushed his hat back on his head ; then he remembered and whipped it off . " Sorry about that . " " Oh , for heaven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell those idiots to stop spraying powder on the merchandise . It will take me all day to clean it up . " " They are looking for fingerprints , " Tony said mildly . " I know . I 'll never get the damned ink off my hands . " " If you 're through yelling , maybe I can ask you some questions . I have ap160few other things to do this afternoon , little unimportant things like investigatingsome murders . " " Okay , okay . " After a moment Karen added , " I 'm sorry , Tony . I appreciateyour coming so quickly . " " Oh , listen , I 've developed a conditioned reflex . I 've seen your name on so many call sheets lately I automatically jump into action . Did you call what's-er-name  --  the owner ? " " She was out . I left a message for her at the hotel . " " The name of which is . . . " " I told the officers . " " Then tell me . " " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you 're Homicide , so this is n't even your case . " " I 'm on my lunch hour , " Tony said . " What I do in my spare time is none of the Department 's business . Now , then , you were about to give me the name of that hotel . " Karen leaned back in her chair . She was recovering from her evil humor ; Tony 's calm , friendly professionalism was comforting to overstrained nerves . " I thought of Julie when you asked me if someone had a grudge against me , " she admitted . " She was furious when I refused to let her have the clothes for her own shop . I gather you know all about that ; you seem to know everything else about me . " " Cheryl talks a lot , " Tony said . " Look , Karen , I 'm doing this because I want to  --  okay ? Nobody 's forcing me . So why do n't you relax and let me do it ? " " Well ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you what is missing . Talk nice to him . " " I do n't know what 's missing . The place is so torn up . . . . Oh , damn ! Julie is going to blow her stack . " Julie did . It was late afternoon before she telephoned , and it was clear that she had already heard the bad news , for she burst into a scream of vituperation as soon as Karen picked up the telephone . Karen had been prepared to sympathize , but the unreasonable accusations of negligence . and worse made her angry ; after trying unsuccessfully to get a word in , she finally hung up . Then she closed the shop and went home . Cheryl administered iced tea and sympathy , and Karen expounded her own theory . " Rob has to be the guilty party . He never showed up , and when I called his number nobody answered . I told Tony , but that man just smiled mysteriously and would n't say a thing . " " I could call him , " Cheryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . Tell me about your day . I 'm sick to death of Julie and her problems . One good thing  --  I 'm through with her . After the things she said to me I do n't feel any obligation about staying on . " You should have told her you quit , " Cheryl said loyally . " I did . Three times . But I do n't think she heard me . She 'll probably show up here later ; do n't be polite and leave us alone , I 'll need your moral support . " " I 'll slug her if she gives you a hard time , " Cheryl promised . " Oh , damn , " Karen said , hearing the telephone . " I 'll bet that 's her now. , , It was Mark . He asked to speak to Cheryl , and Karen handed over thephone . Cheryl covered the mouthpiece with her hand . " Can I  --  " " Oh , sure , go ahead . Tony has probably talked to him already . " She stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her a few minutes later . " Mark was wondering , " she began , " if we'dlike to go  --  " " He 'll have to settle for hamburgers and potato salad . " Karen gestured with her paring knife at the pile of vegetables . " And tell him to bring that closemouthed friend of his . Maybe when Tony is off duty and full of food he 'll be more communicative. " ++444*TONY was perfectly willing to talk . " It 's not a secret . You did n't have to bribe me . But I 'm glad you did , " he added , accepting a second serving of potato salad . They were sitting around the kitchen table . It was still too hot for an outdoor picnic , and Ruth 's formal dining room did n't seem appropriate for hamburgers and the beer Mark had brought . He and Tony were in their shirt sleeves and the latter was very obviously off duty . He paid Karen outrageous compliments on her cooking ; when she accused him of looking unusually pleased with himself , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've solved the identity of your ghost , Karen . Since he 's probablywell on his way to parts unknown , you should n't have any more trouble . " " Rob ? " Karen asked . " You do n't sound surprised . " " I am  --  and I 'm not . I knew he did n't like me , but I ca n't believe he would be so vicious . "  | " You 're jumping to conclusions , " Mark said , tugging absently at a lock of hair . " What makes you think it was Rob ? " " This was found on the floor of the office , where it might have fallen out of someone 's pocket , and been kicked into a corner . I persuaded the boys to let me have a copy . " He handed the paper to Karen . Mark reached for her hand and moved it into a position from which he could see too . His fingers tightened over hers , and he muttered something under his breath . The original had been a group photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my college yearbook , " she said in a strained voice . " I made the tennis team the first year  --  by a fluke , really , everybody got sick or broke an ankle or something . That 's Anne  --  I forget her last name . . . Susan Reeder . . . and ( strange how hard it was for her to pronounce the name ) . . . and Shreve . " " And the hole in the middle is you ? " Mark asked . He snatched the paper from her numbed fingers and examined it closely . " The names are printed underneath , " Tony said . " That 's how I knew . The face has been obliterated . Slashed with a knife or a pair of scissors . " " How do you suppose Rob got hold of this ? " Cheryl asked . Some of the pretty color had faded from her cheeks . " Julie brought the yearbook in one day , " Karen said . She had to clear her throat before she went on . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think she wanted to rub it in  --  how much I had changed . She showed it to Rob and  --  and to other people . He made a few of his cute little cutting remarks . . . . I thought she had taken it home after the joke wore thin . " " She may have . The book was n't at the shop . " Tony retrieved the paper from Mark , who was holding it by the tips of his fingers , his lips curled in disgust . " This is proof of malice  --  " " Malice ? " Mark 's hair stood up in agitated tufts . " This is sick . " Tony looked uncomfortable . " I did n't realize how it would affect you . Guess I 've become hardened ; some of the things I see make this look like a harmless joke . Sorry , Karen . " " It is n't only the photograph , " Karen said . " It 's the total accumulation . I feel as if I 've been walking blindly along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way  --  assuming I was on solid ground  --  and all of a sudden I look down and see there is nothing under my feet except a narrow plank over an abyss . And someone is sawing the plank . I 've never deliberately hurt anyone . . . . " The movement Mark made was so slight no one except Karen noticed it ; it affected her like a bolt of lightning that cast a sudden garish illumination into dark corners of her mind . She had never thought of her actions asp163hurting Mark himself , only his pride  --  his ego . There had been no commitmentbroken . . . . At least that was what she had believed . " Sure , I know that , " Tony said . " You 're a natural victim , that 's all . " It was Cheryl , not Karen , who exclaimed in indignant repudiation . Karen was struck speechless by this second burst of enlightenment . She felt as if someone were not only sawing the plank on which she walked , but knocking down all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural victim , the helpless object of random violence , the scapegoat for resentment and hatred she had done nothing to deserve ? The idea was humiliating and repellent . Tony had tried to redeem his error by explaining . " Most women are passive victim types . . . . " This had only enraged Cheryl more , and they got into a heated argument which Tony ended by snapping , " Nobody would ever accuse you of being passive . " " Leave him alone , Cheryl , " Karen ordered . Cheryl looked at her in surprise , and subsided . Tony let out a martyred sigh . " Thanks , lady . As I was about to say  --  with the obviously mistaken intention of relieving everybody 's mind  --  the robbery was an inside job . Your friend Rob tried to make it look like a break-in , but it was a clumsy effort that would n't fool a baby . Now he 's disappeared . One of the other tenants in his building saw him go out last night about midnight . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mark continued to tug at his hair . Tony added , " He has a record . Petty larceny , procuring , immoral acts  --  " " What kind of immoral acts ? " Cheryl asked , her eyes bright with curiosity . " Uh  --  you know . The usual . " " Porno films and dirty photographs , " Mark said , his tight lips relaxing into a half-smile . " She 's of age , Tony , you do n't have to be so prim and proper . How about drugs ? " " He used ' em . But we never picked him up for dealing . " " Burglary ? Breaking and entering ? " " No . " " Assault ? Armed robbery ? " " No . Now look , Mark , I know what you 're getting at and I 'm here to tell you it does n't mean a damned thing . " " It 's the wrong profile , " Mark insisted . " You used the word passive  --  that 's the word for little Robbie and his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here or attack Karen . " " You do n't know what he would do . That 's the trouble with you armchairdetectives , you think real life is like the cases you read about , all neat and tidy and tied up with a ribbon . "  |p164They  glowered at one another . Tony 's brows were drawn down until they almost met in the middle of his forehead ; Mark 's face showed the familiar dark mantling of anger . This was n't one of their usual friendly arguments ; Karen could almost feel the tension between them . Mark turned his head slightly . His eyes met Karen 's for a brief , electric moment before he looked away and made a visible effort to control hi , , temper . " I 'm not trying to tell you your job , Tony , but there are some big gaping holes in your theory . If Rob decided to take off after robbing the shop , why did n't he do a thorough job of robbing it ? According to Karen , none of the major items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to turn off the alarm ; he could have pulled a truck up to the back door and loaded it . Why leave the most valuable pieces ? " " You said it yourself , " Karen replied , before Tony could speak . " He 's a coward . He was afraid he 'd be seen . " " Whose side are you on ? " Mark demanded . " Tony 's , " Karen said . " I knew this woman had brains , " Tony said , relaxing . " You have a point , Mark , but again you 're assuming this guy was behaving rationally After we 've talked with the owner  --  " " You 're about to have that pleasure , " Karen said , as the doorbell set up an angry , persistent clamor . " That sounds like Julie . I thought she 'd come here looking for me . Somebody hold on to the dog . " She never knew whether the request was deliberately ignored , or whether Alexander 's escape was accidental . He arrived on the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scream of pain . It was Mark who removed the culprit and sent him flying with a whack on his hairless rump . Mark 's appearance halted Julie 's outcries . Smiling and brave , she allowed herself to be escorted to the kitchen , and accepted a beer . " You ca n't blame me for being upset , " she said plaintively . " Karen understands ; she knows how I am . Darling  --  " She fumbled for Karen 's hand and clasped it tightly . " Darling Karen , I 'm so relieved you were n't hurt . That was my first thought : Thank God Karen was n't there , she might have been hurt . " Karen freed her hand . " It 's not likely that I would be at work in the middle of the night . " " Oh , " Julie murmured . " Was that when it happened ? " " So we assume , " Tony answered . " Do you mind answering a few questions , Ms. Kerchak ? It 's not official procedure , but since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Julie . " She smiled at him , lips tremulous , lashes quivering . " And please ask any questions you like . "  |p165At  first Julie refused to believe Rob was the thief . She defended him so vehemently that Karen wondered again whether their relationship was more intimate than she had believed . Yet Julie 's arguments were not those of an infatuated lover . " He might sneak things into his pockets  --  he 's done it before  --  but he would n't risk his job . He 's got a soft deal with me and he knows it , lots of perks on the side . . . " " Like meeting wealthy women customers , " said Mark . Julie 's lids veiled her eyes . " That 's not my business . I tell you , Rob willturn up in a few days . He 's gone off with one of his women , that 's all . " " The locks were n't forced , " Tony said . " Who else had keys ? " " Why , no one . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone andthe quick , sidelong look she gave Karen virtually amounted to an accusation . No one spoke . Cheryl was crimson with anger , but Tony 's hand on her shoulder kept her quiet . After a moment Julie threw up her hands . " I 'm so upset I do n't know what I 'm saying . I wo n't sleep a wink tonight , I just know I wo n't . I 'm afraid to go home . What if someone is there , waiting  --  " " I 'll take you home if you like , " Tony said . " Oh , would you ? That is so sweet of you . I 'd appreciate it more than I can say . Good night , all . Karen , I 'll see you tomorrow . " Karen cleared her throat . Even after Julie 's latest outrage she felt some qualms about what she was planning to do , but Tony 's casual comments still rankled . A helpless victim type , was she ? Not if she could help it . " You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quit ? Oh , but Karen  --  " " I quit three times . " " I thought you were joking . You did n't take those things I said seriously , did you ? Karen , you know how I am ! " " You also fired me . Right after I quit the first time . " " Oh , Karen . " Julie clung to her hands . " You ca n't leave me in the lurch . You ca n't abandon me when I need you . " " I 'll try to help you out now and then , until you find someone else . But I ca n't come in tomorrow . I 'm busy . " Julie looked as if she were choking on the words she had to hold back . It was Tony 's presence that restrained her ; taking the arm he had not offered , she drooped and clung her way out of the house . Cheryl immediately opened the back door . " Place needs airing out . What a bitchy broad ! I was afraid for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to work . " " I 'm not quite as big a sucker as everyone seems to think , " Karen said shortly.  | " Hey , I did n't  --  " " I know . I was n't referring to you . " But even Cheryl had a protective big-sister attitude at times . That could be charming  --  if one was n't overly sensitive about one 's passivity . Mark did not protest . Instead he said mildly , " She 's the kind of friend immortalized in the classic saying about not needing enemies . Has she really been out of town the past week ? " " I have no reason to suppose she was lying , " Karen said . " Right . Well , Tony will find out . " " Is that why he was so gallant about offering to take her home ? " Cheryl asked . " It was n't because he 's wild about her company . She 's not his type . " Mark spoke abstractedly , as if his mind were on something else . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired to try anything tonight , " Cheryl said . " And if it was Rob , he 's long gone . Looks as if we can get a good night 's sleep , Karen . " " Is that a hint ? " Mark asked , without moving . " No , just an announcement . You two can sit here all night if you want . I 'm going to bed . " Mark got to his feet . " What 's on the schedule tomorrow ? " " Virginia , " Cheryl said with a grin . " Not all of it , just as much of it as we can cover . Why , were you about to make us an offer ? " " Just curious . Drive carefully , hmmm ? " He gave her a quick kiss on the cheek and nodded casually at Karen . " Good night . " Karen stayed in the kitchen when Cheryl went to the door with Mark . He had made it clear he was n't interested in her company . Why was he so determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tony felt sure the trouble was over . Rob and/or Julie were certainly the most likely suspects . It was almost as if Mark wanted her to be afraid . OCCOQUAN , the town in Prince William County Cheryl had mentioned , was charming  --  small in size , fronting directly on the river , with a disproportionatenumber of craft and antique shops . According to Cheryl , its other advantages included restaurants with liquor licenses and lots of saladson the menu . " That 's important , " she insisted , when Karen laughed at her . " I went antiquing a couple of times with some of those high-class Washington women  --  friends of Mark 's , being nice to his poor relation  --  and I 'm tell/ing you , they consider the day a dead loss if they ca n't get their booze at lunchtime . " However , the only available building had no living quarters attached and the structure was in poor repair . They left their names with the realtor and inspected a few other properties in nearby towns before heading northward , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in Leesburg , which Karen remembered as a quiet country town with a number of fine eighteenth-century houses . It also had several antique shops and restaurants that met Cheryl 's specifications . However , Cheryl was pessimistic about their chance of finding anything in their price range . " Loudon County is getting fashionable , which means expensive . There 's a new shopping mall in Leesburg , one of those restoration projects like Harborplace and Faquier Square ; that will drive prices up too . " They found one house that tempted both of them . Though the original structure was much older , turn-of-the-century additions had turned it into a late-Victorian gem with a wide veranda supported by white pillars and a profusion of gingerbread trim . The third floor had been converted into a separate suite with its own kitchen and bath , and there were two other bedrooms in an annex that overlooked a sunny , tree-shaded yard . The moment Karen saw the twin drawing rooms , one on either side of a wide , handsome hall , she knew they were the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the mental image she had formed that she had an eerie sense of deja vu . The owner did n't think he wanted to rent . He had not quite made up his mind , but he was in a hurry to sell and would give them a price they could n't refuse . " We should have known it was just a come-on , " Cheryl said disgustedly , as they drove away from the realtor 's office . " These people will do anythingand say anything to get you into a house . They think you 'll fall in love with it and forget it does n't meet any of your specifications . " " It almost worked , did n't it ? " Karen , in the passenger 's seat , twisted around for a last look as they passed the house . Wicker furniture and ferns on the front porch , she thought ; in fine weather we could have dressed-up dummies sitting in the chairs , like ladies having tea . Dressed-up dummies reminded her of her plundered wardrobe and the case Tony had mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had passed a quiet night , with not so much as a growl from Alexander to alarm them . It must have been Rob , she thought . I wonder where he is now . Cheryl glanced wistfully around as they drove through the quiet streets toward the highway . " It 's a pretty town . I bet the schools are good , too . " " Maybe we could afford to buy . "  | " No , we could n't . " Cheryl gave her an affectionate smile . " I was just dreaming out loud . Does n't cost anything to dream . What do you say we head south on Route 15 ? Then we can take 50 back to the Beltway . " Karen glanced at the map . " I hope you are n't dreaming about finding a place in Middleburg . Even in my day it was a haven for the horsy rich . " " It 's even more so now . But it ca n't do any harm to look . Maybe one of the nearby towns will have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little shop specializing in vintage clothing . The owner was not overly gracious ; either she spotted them as prospective competitors or she was unimpressed by their rumpled appearance . " You should n't have asked her about her overhead , " Karen said , as they walked along the street toward a realtor 's office . " That was a dead give-away . " " Well , we have to find out about those things . Most of the other merchantsI 've talked to have been nice and helpful . " The realtor was nice but not very helpful . As they had suspected , rentals in the center of town were beyond their means , and the few properties she had listed in outlying areas had other disadvantages . They left the office with a handful of Xeroxed papers to add to the other listings they had collected . " I 've had it , " Karen announced , as they got back into the car . " Let 's quit for the day . " " What do you say we go home by back roads ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the area . " " You 're driving . " Karen settled back . " Lord , it 's hot . Turn that airconditioningup , will you ? " The countryside steamed under a hazy sun . From the cool comfort of the car it looked very attractive , the lush greenery of trees and pasture forming a perfect setting for the white-pillared and soft red brick facades of handsome old houses . Cheryl drove easily and competently , undisturbed by the slow-moving farm vehicles that sometimes slowed their pace to a crawl . Fields of ripe hay glowed like golden tapestries ; the corn was tassled and breast-high , and beyond white-painted fences horses grazed in the green meadows , their coats of black and russet shining in the sunlight . " What a way to live , " Cheryl said , glancing at a mansion high on a knoll beside the road . " If you do n't mind living with security guards and Dobermans , " Karen said , indicating the closed gates and the two fierce dogs behind them . Cheryl flicked on the turn signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway and let that Cadillac pass . It 's been driving up my tailpipe for the **26;14522;TOOLONG you will see the words are indeed unchanged . " He stood , indicating that the visit was over . " And you want to take Yacov back with you to talk with the policeman ? " " Yes . I 'll send him home in a taxi , " she promised . Yacov brightenedat that , and Grandfather reached out and chucked his chin . " I 've never ridden in a taxi , Grandfather ! " he said hopefully . " Nor have I , Yacov . " He smiled into his eyes . " What 's the matter  --  abus is n't good enough anymore ? " " It 's fine but .. . " Such an expense ! " The old man looked up at Ellie . " The bus is fine . Home before dark , eh ? " David stood across the street from the Moniger home and continuedthe long debate with himself . " You should have called her first , dope . He looked up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hers . If she looked out now , she would see him sweating and pacing as he worked up the courage to go to the door and knock . " So what are you going to say to her ? Hi , I was in the neighborhood ; thought I 'd just drop by ' ? That wo n't make it , David , " he muttered . " I 've got this old Jewish buddy who happened to mention they needed somebody to fly planes over here . It 's a legitimate job . You said I ought to quit barnstorming and settle down . ' " Somehow , nothing sounded right to say . The truth of the matter was simply that David had accepted the job because he knew that Ellie was in Jerusalem and he wanted to see her again . He just could n't figure out how to tell her . David took a deep breath and ran his fingers through his tousledhair . He unzipped his flight jacket , then zipped it up again nervously as he crossed the street to the front steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then hesitated , waiting for the knot in his stomach to smooth out . " Good grief , " he mumbled , " I 've been up against crack Nazi pilots and was n't this scared . " As if he were forcing the control stick forward into a fatal dive , David forced his hand to knock on the massive white door . For a few moments , to his relief and disappointment , it seemed as though no one would answer , then , as he was about to turn and retreat down the steps , the knob clicked and the door creaked open a few inches . Miriam poked her face out and surveyed David . " What do you want ? " she demanded . " I . . . uh , is this where Ellie Warne lives ? " He plunged his hands into his pockets . " And if it is ? " the old woman asked  | " I 'm an old friend of hers . I mean I  --  " He noticed that his voice sounded much higher than usual . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her mom . Can I see her ? " " Miss Ellie is not home . " " When is she coming back ? " " I will give her the letter and tell her you have come here to . see her . " The old woman put out her wrinkled palm . " That 's okay . I want to surprise her . " He stuck out his hand then and shook hands with her . " David Meyer is the name . " The old woman 's face was transformed when she heard his name . " Ah , yes , I hear of you ! " she exclaimed . " You have ? " " Many times . When Miss Ellie is sick she say your name ! A very good friend , indeed . " The door swung open wide and Miriam stepped aside to let David in . " So come in , young man . I shall fix tea . Such a long way you have come to bring a letter . " Baffled by the reception , he followed her meekly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You sure can tell what the professor does for a living , " he said , admiring an ancient enameled Egyptian jar on the table beside him . " Kind of like a museum , is n't it ? " " The dust , it is most terrible . Just wait here , " Miriam instructed as she bustled off to fix tea , leaving David alone in the room . " So she talked about me , huh ? " David mused . " And all this time I figuredshe would n't even think about me . The old lady says she said my name . ' Course she could have been having bad dreams just as easy . " The knot inside tightened again and he felt the urge to turn and run . It had been almost a year since he had seen Ellie . He figured after this much time he should have forgotten not only the color of her eyes , but her name as well . Now here he was , halfway around the world , playing the role of mailman to a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard he tried . In a way he hated the weakness in himself that brought him to this place , and he hated her for making him love her so much . Without her he felt like a plane without a rudder , when before he could simply glide with the wind and never care what direction his life was taking . Now he cared . Just like those other dopes in his squadronduring the war who had fallen in love and gotten married on leave while he had laughed and sworn that it could n't happen to him . Then he had met her . From the beginning he had known that their relationship wasp102important to her , but he had denied what he felt , pushed aside the noose that would fit too tightly around his neck . He denied that he loved her even as he whispered to her and held her gently against him . Even when thoughts of her crowded out the laughter of every other girl he spent time with , he had refused to admit that there was something special about Ellie . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was doing to her soul , so finally she had told him to shove off , to go stall his engine in a power dive . She has a way with words , he thought , smiling at the memory . With a shrug of his shoulders he had gone , pretending that he did n't care  --  the big tough war ace , too hard to care anymore . They called him Tin Man in the squadron because everyone said he had no heart , and he had almost come to believe it about himself . Now here he sat like a teenager in love for the first time , following his girl from one end of the world to the other . Jerusalem was sure enough the far end of the world ! He took a deep breath and caught the sweet scent of lilacs that he recognized as her perfume . The first time he had buried his face in her neck , he had told her that she smelled just like his grandmother . Some compliment . He inhaled again , aware that this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the room , wanting to touch the things she had touched . Mostly he wanted to see her face and tell her he had been wrong . Wrong about everything . He wanted her to know that he was n't running away anymore ; he was searching for a missing piece of himself , searching for his heart , like the Tin Man . Miriam brought tea . It was hot tea , which he did n't like , not without lots of lemon and a couple of spoonfuls of sugar , but he sat on the edge of the chair and held the dainty little china cup awkwardly in his big paw . " Shall you like to wait , young man ? " Miriam asked . " Or perhaps you will rather go find her ? I worry so on a day like today . Lately any woman alone in the Old City is not safe . " David set the cup down with a clatter . " She 's where ? Alone ? " " With her camera , no doubt hoping murder will be done soshe will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say this because you know Miss Ellie . " She was only half joking . " Right . Looking for the Pulitzer . " He stood . " Do you know where she is ? The general area . " " She leaves an address here . " Miriam retrieved a piece of paper from the long sideboard . " The Jewish Quarter . The home of Rabbi Lebowitz . Go by way of Jaffa Gate . "  |p103The  Mufti 's orders to his men had been simple : the riot was to serve a twofold purpose . It would show the U.N . and the world how foolish they were to think that Jews could ever hold their ground against the tidal wave of the Faithful who surrounded them . Surely when they saw what bloodshed they had caused with their foolish vote , they would consider ways to change it . And , of course , violence would provide an excellent cover for the murder of the Jewish boy , the witness , and the disappearance of the red-haired woman . The riot must appear to be spontaneous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in the courtyard of the Dome of the Rock . All the Arabs of Jerusalem feared his power , but the majority did not approve of his politics or his methods . Men would not murder for the sake of politics ; they must be moved by passion and revenge . This demonstration must begin as a spark that would ignite all of the Arabs against the Jews , and no one must ever suspect that it was the hot wind of the Mufti that blew the fire where he willed . " Our leader is inspired by Allah , " commented Hassan as he and Kadar moved quickly from Arab shop to Arab shop . The lie united men and boys into one raging , avenging mob that swept through the souks repeating the lie until hatred simmered , then boiled over into the adjoining quarters of the Old City . When at last the lie surged through Jaffa Gate and into the Jewish commerical district , no one bothered anymore to ask if it was true . It was shouted from the lips and written on the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear ? " Kadar asked the quiet coppersmith . " A gang of Jews raped two young Arab women only this morning at Jaffa Gate . "  |p104It  was nearly noon by the time Ellie passed through the gate with Yacov and his dog . The smells of roasting chicken and grilling lamb drifted through the air of the New City Jewish commercial district , and Ellie felt her stomach rumble . She wished she had taken Miriam up on her offer of Belgian waffles that morning . " Are you hungry ? " she asked Yacov as he and Shaul in unison lifted their noses to the aroma and inhaled deeply . The boy nodded his head vigorously . " Me , too  --  starving ! " Ellie said . " So where 's a good place to eat around here ? Lunch is on me . " " There is a falafal shop not far . " He licked his lips at the thought . " The best in the New City . " Then he added , " You have falafal in America ? " " Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his shoulders . " Back home we call it a hamburger , but it 's not . half as good as falafal , Yacov . " The image of the round , flat pita bread stuffed with lamb and rice made her mouth water . If there was one thing Ellie could write home about , it was the Jewish food . The cafe was a tiny place wedged between a tailor shop and a linen shop . It was crowded with black-coated merchants and shop girls shouting their orders over a tall counter to the harried couple behind . Two men seated at a rickety table in front of the window stood up as Ellie and Yacov entered . Quickly Ellie sat down and pushed the empty plates and wadded napkins into a heap at the edge of the table . Yacov pulled up the chair opposite her and sat down , then looked out the window at Shaul waiting patiently by the door.  | " Looks like everybody in Jerusalem but me knew about this place , " Ellie shouted over the din of clattering plates and bantering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everything , " said Yacov enthusiastically as a stoop-shoulderedold waiter scraped the dirty dishes onto a tray and bustled off . He returned a moment later with a pencil behind his ear and a small pad of paper to take their order . He spoke kindly in Yiddish and Ellie said quickly to Yacov , " Order for me . " When Yacov finished , the old man bowed politely and said to Ellie , " Sehr gut , liebshen , " as he replaced the pencil behind his ear and plowed through the standing customers to deliver their order . " What am I having ? " she asked Yacov . " Chicken . And I , lamb . And do you know about a drink called Coca-Cola ? A new invention in Palestine . " " Pretty good stuff , is it ? " asked Ellie wryly . " I have had it but one time , " assured Yacov , " but it is most wonderful . " Outside the window , Shaul leaped to his feet suddenly and began to bark . Yacov craned his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeing someone across the street . " Is he hungry , too ? " Ellie asked . " No . It is something else he sees , " Yacov watched him with disturbed interest . " Or hears . " For a few moments Ellie searched the faces of the pedestrians that passed in front of the window , then turned her interest to the strange menu before her . Without Yacov , she would not have had the slightest idea what to order . When she looked up again , Yacov was standing at the window with a deep frown on his face as he scanned the street then turned his eyes to the barking dog . " Sit down , Yacov , " she said . " Lunch will be here in a second . " " But look , " he said , almost in a whisper . " Do you not see ? " With alarm , Ellie gazed in the direction he was staring . Far up the street , people seemed to be running toward them . A man on the sidewalk directly in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellie watched his face fill with horror and fear . He turned on his heel and crashed through the door of the cafe , knocking another man down . " It is a riot ! " he cried . " The Arabs have taken to the streets . Close your shops ! Everybody return to your homes . " A woman screamed . Men cursed in Yiddish as they pushed through the door en masse . Ellie and Yacov jumped from their chairs and crowded back in the corner , still able to see the panicp106in the street . Ellie pulled out her camera and began snapping picturesas Jewish men and women rushed past . A plump older woman in a blue flower-print dress ran past with her arms raised high in the air and her mouth open in incomprehensible screams . " Come on , " Yacov said as he jerked Ellie 's sleeve . " We must run . " Yacov pulled her toward the door . The cafe owner pushed her from behind , while his wife stood weeping and wringing her hands behind the counter . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the confusion and gawked . Everywhere , anxious merchants cranked down the heavy metal shutters over the doors and windows of their shops . Only a block away the thunderous cry of " Jihad ! Jihad ! Jihad ! " mingled with the cries of the Jews as they fled before the mob or fought the fires that engulfed their shops . Then , as the merchants ran past her and the angry mob approached , Ellie saw the figure of the same Palestinian police officer that had interviewed her only that morning . He stood nonchalantly leaning against a wall with his arms folded , watching with indifference . Three young Arab men stood a few yards away from him , just out of her view . All of them gazed steadily at her . With a nod of his head , one of the three pointed at her and began to cut through the fleeing crowd in a deliberate path toward where Ellie stood . She raised her camera and photographed the policeman , filled with rage that a man with government authority could stand in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned to Yacov , whose pleas for her to run with the others had been made in panicked Yiddish . A few minutes after the howling mob had entered the district , Princess Mary Avenue and Mamillah Road were littered with injured Jewish shopkeepers and the loot from their shops . Ellie stood rivetedto the sidewalk , helpless to stop the violence exploding around her . The smoke that swept along the street like a thick gray fog stung her eyes and engulfed everything in a dreamlike darkness . Her cheeks were wet with tears . Shaul 's frantic barking mingled with the sounds of crashing glass and anguished cries . Workers , peasants , and adolescents in black and white checkered keffiyahs swung clubs and iron bars in frantic and inhuman rage . " Come on , lady ! " urged Yacov . " Please ! " He pulled hard on her arm ; then he was pushed into the flow of the crowd , still reachingand calling for her . " It 's a nightmare ! " she shouted . " God , a nightmare ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the boy . Just in front of her a sobbing tailor cranked downp107the shutter of his shop . The three men emerged from the crowd near him and stood in a defiant line waiting for Ellie . The tailor lunged at them and was cut down by a blow to the back of his head with a pipe . Then , as Ellie raised her camera with trembling hands and snapped the shutter once again , the tallest of the three Arabs plunged a long curved knife deep into the tailor 's back . Ellie screamed as the man 's life ebbed away on the sidewalk . She felt her stomach revolt at the sight , and turned aside to be sick . The world spun violently around her ; she braced herself against the half-closed shutter of the tailor shop and stared blankly at the three Arabs that stood before her . Then her eyes fell to the knife of the murderer ; blood dripped from the point of his knife onto the toe of his shoe . Then they took another step nearer to her . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the man with the knife as he reached out and grabbed the collar of her shirt ; then he pressed himself against her , pinning her to the wall with his weight and the force of his rage . Yacov turned and through the undulating flow of the mob saw Ellie pushed against the shutter . " They will have her ! " he cried . " Shaul ! " he screamed to the dog . " Stop them ! " He pointed toward the men and Ellie as he fought his way back toward her . The murderer tore at Ellie 's blouse , ripping away the buttons as he shoved her to the sidewalk and under the shutter into the darkness of the shop . If two Arab women were raped , then a thousandJewish women would pay . He would begin the retribution with this red-haired woman before he turned her over to Hassan and the Mufti . The dog dodged and ran through the legs of Jews and Arabs , then , lips curled back in a snarl , he leaped at the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolflike teeth tore a jagged hole in the man 's cheek , and he screeched curses and flailed wildly against the force of the attack . Startled , his companions stepped back long enough for Yacov to slip past them and the body of the tailor into the shop where Ellie scrambled to find a place to hide . " They will come for you , lady . Come on ! " Yacov grabbed her arm and ran toward a stairway at the back of the shop . Just as suddenly as he had attacked , Shaul turned away from the whimpering man and followed Yacov and Ellie as they dashed toward the stairs . Watching the event from an alcove across the street , Hassan left his post and started after Ellie and the boy as his henchmanp108struggled to his feet , wiping blood from his face . As Ellie and Yacov bounded up the dark stairway , the cries of the riot seemed unreal to her . Her ears were filled only with the sounds of her heart beating and short sobs that she knew must be her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward the door at the top of the stairs . She clutched at the camera still danglingaround her neck . " It 's okay , lady , " he said softly . " We will make it . " Then as Shaul bumped his heels , he ordered , " To the butcher shop , Shaul ! " In instant obedience , the dog turned and ran back toward the street , ramming into the legs of Hassan and the three men as he passed beneath the shutter . " I shall kill the dog ! " screamed the murderer as Shaul disappeared into the crowd . " Forget the animal ! " Hassan snapped . " It is the woman and the child we need . They have no way out . Set a fire and let us be done with it . " Hassan took a can of gasoline from a teenaged boy , sloshing the volatile fluids through the open door of the falafal shop . The three Arabs poured a stream of gasoline into the tailor shop and struck a match . With a roar , hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluttered shop . Yacov turned the doorknob and threw himself against the door at the top of the stairs . As heat and light rushed toward them , they fell into the tailor 's apartment . With a sense of unreality , Ellie noticed the dead man 's lunch still on the table . A half glass of wine waited where he had left it . Deftly , Yacov found the narrow ladder that led to the rooftop . " Come on , lady . They will roast us like chickens ! " he yelled as he pulled her toward the ladder . " What 's up here ? " she asked , feeling trapped and panicked . " It is the only way ! " he cried , shoving her up toward the trapdoor , then onto the flat roof as flames crackled behind them . Black smoke followed them as the fire quickly devoured the interior of the shop and then licked the apartment . Yacov slammed the trapdoorclosed and ran to the edge of the roof . Peering over , he saw the police uniform of Hassan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and glimpsed Yacov ; then he pointed as hisview was obscured by the smoke of nearly one hundred fires . " There is a policeman standing by the men ! " he shouted toEllie . " Come see . Perhaps he will stop them . " Crouching low , Ellie scrambled toward Yacov and looked overp109the edge as smoke began to pour from the under rim of the closed trapdoor . Wafts of black smoke drifted by as Ellie tried to make out the features of the policeman . In one clear instant she recognized the upturned face of Hassan . " It 's the same one we 're supposed to talk to this afternoon . I saw him a while ago , too . " " Come , we must go . The fire . " Yacov tugged at her arm and led her to the edge of the roof closest to another building . Although the space between the two buildings was only four feet , to Ellie it looked like a yawning chasm . " We must jump . " Yacov climbed to the lip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the rough earth thirty feet below her as the fire burst through the trapdoor . " Now ! " Yacov jumped to the opposite roof , rolled a few feet then jumped up . " It is not too far , lady ! Jump ! " he urged . The fury of the fire raged behind her , warming her back as she teetered on the edge of the roof trying to gather the courage to jump . Below her she could hear the crash of timbers as the second floor of the apartment began to fall through . " Hurry ! " Yacov cried . " Please , lady . Please jump ! " He held his hands out toward her . She focused on his hands . Such small hands , yet she somehow felt as though they were trying to lift her over the gulf that stood between her and safety . Her knees felt like water ; she turned in time to see the tar of the roof catch fire and race toward her . Then she crouched and jumped with all her might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her feet , holding tightly to the boy as the roof of the tailor shop collapsed where she had stood only seconds before . Hassan and his men followed their progress as Yacov led Ellie to yet another rooftop leap and still another . A volley of gunfire ripped through the crowd below , silencing the screams of nearly a dozen Jews . Ellie recognized the body of the woman in the blue- , flowered dress who had run in front of the cafe . Slouched against the side of a building was the Yiddish-speaking waiter who had taken their order . His white apron was drenched with blood , but Ellie saw the pencil still lodged behind his ear . And always , Hassan and the three Arab men followed them , their eyes turned upward as if the death and destruction around them were an everyday occurrence . " The policeman is one of them ! " Ellie shouted . " He 's leading them right for us . " Suddenly a bullet ricocheted off the dome of the roof , justp110inches from Yacov 's head . Plaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He dropped to his knees and cried out , clutching his face . " Are you hurt ? " Ellie cried , rushing to his side . She pulled his hands away . His face was pitted with plaster and his eyes were swollen shut . " I ca n't see ! " the boy sobbed . " My eyes ! " Another bullet ripped into the structure behind Ellie . " Yacov , is there another way off these roofs ? We 're like ducks in a shooting gallery up here . " Still unable to see , the boy nodded . " Do you see just down the block ? A large building ? It is the theater . We can get to the balcony from here . Inside the theater . But you will have to help me . " " God , help me ! " Ellie glanced back as the flames from the tailor shop raced from building to building and threatened the structurewhere they waited now . Never had she felt such fear , and yet as she remembered the boy 's small hands reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her neck and swung him onto her back . Crouching , she ran to the edge of the building and leaped onto the next , spilling onto the rough tar roof . " Are you okay ? " she asked , gathering him onto her back once again . He nodded , then clung tightly to her . " Tell me when you are jumping , lady . " " You scared or something ? " she asked , running a pattern across the roof like a football quarterback . " Yes , " he answered . " Me too , " she replied , staring over the edge of the roof to the top of a building several feet below them . " Ready ? " The jump was at least a foot farther , but Ellie hoped that since the roof was below them they would make it . Just beyond was the theater , and Ellie could just make out the fire-escape ladder that led to the balcony . " Ready ? " she repeated , not sure that she was . " Yes . " Ellie took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diving board into deep water . Then she jumped , her feet landing on the very edge of the building . She fought to regain her balance , but the weight of the boy pulled her backward . Yacov fell from her back as she lurched forward , his hands barely catching the ledge . He cried out , sensing death below him if he lost his grip . Ellie clambered toward him on her hands and knees , and reaching him just as his hands began to lose their tenuous hold . " I 've got you , son ! " she cried , grabbing his wrist and pulling himp111up to her . " We almost got it that time . " She hauled him up , then fell back , exhausted as he sat heaving , cradling his face . Smoke swirled through the sky above her , dancing to some unheard melody , while below , the staccato of gunfire was punctuated by screams . David fought his way inch by inch up Princess Mary Avenue trying to reach Jaffa Gate . Somewhere , he knew , Ellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight in his stomach as he watched men and women fall around him . Had she fallen , too ? He wanted to shout her name , to keep on calling until she heard and answered , but he knew that shouting would be futile in this din . His eyes searched for the copper glow of her hair amidst the bloodstained rabble that surged against him , pushing him back . And on he pressed , straining against the current , hoping to find her before it was too late . Piles of goods were everywhere being set on fire and no one , it seemed , had raised a finger to stop the mob . He heard the roar of an engine and with some relief watched as two dozen British troops piled out of the canvas-covered truck bed onto the street . His relief soon evaporated , however , replaced by anger as the troops simply stood ready in the street as the brutality raged around them . A man in a Palestine police uniform stood gawking at the roof of a burning building doing nothing to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture to three grim Arab men ; then his eyes followed the gesture toward the rooftop . A girl 's copper hair bobbed across the roofline . But it could n't be  --  she was carrying a small boy on her back ! But if it was Ellie , and those men  --  . Horror and hope rose up in David 's heart as the girl plunged over the edge of the roof onto another building across a gulf five feet wide and another six feet below her . She fell , and the boy slipped from her grasp and clung to the edge of the roof . Then she turned , grabbing the boy by the wrist , and David caught a glimpse of her face as she leaned over the building . " Ellie ! " he shouted . " Hold on ! " he yelled . " Do n't let go ! Hang on ! " As she hauled the boy to her , one of the Arab men pulled an ancient revolver and took aim as the policeman simply looked on . David yelled again and charged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the trigger . " Ellie ! " he cried again . " Run for it ! " The gap-toothed policeman smiled and kicked David hard in the groin , and darkness circled around him.  |p112Ellie  pulled herself up and pulled Yacov onto her back once again . She sprinted across the rooftop , and without looking at the ground , she reached out for the rickety metal ladder on the side of the theater building . " Hang on now , " she warned . " It 's just a short hop to the ladder . Just hang on . " Her fear had given birth to a courage she had not been aware even existed in her . " I 'm no Errol Flynn , " she muttered , " but I can do this . " She grasped the ladder and jumped , both feet catching the rungs with ease . She looked over her shoulder and down , watching as Hassan and his thugs attacked a man in the street . " At least they 're not watching us , " she said , climbing as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-escape entrance to the theater . She carefully placed Yacov 's hands securely on the railing and helped him climb up to the platform . Even before she joined him , he had the splintered wooden door open and was crawling into the theater . She climbed in after him and shut the door , hoping that their pursuers had not spotted them . " I sneak into the movie this way , " Yacov leaned against the cool cinder-block wall behind a heavy velvet curtain . " My eyes , " he said softly . " They hurt . " Ellie peeked out from behind the curtain . The place was nearly dark and totally deserted . Outside , the popping of machine-gun fire filtered through the thin , wooden door . Ellie felt as though they had , indeed , just come through a war movie complete with genuine bad guys . But a moment later she heard a dull systematic thudding . " The theater doors ! " she cried . " They 've found us ! " The boy reached out for Ellie as the steady cadence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was afraid ; then he said , " It is all right , lady . We will be okay . But we got to go . " He patted her hand comfortingly . She wondered if he had forgotten that she was the adult , and he was the child . A barrage of gunfire accompanied the final crash of the doors . The theater filled with murky light and the sound of Hassan and his men ordering rioters to slash and soak the seats with gasoline . Ellie peered out from behind the curtain at Hassan as he stood in the center of the reeking chaos and scanned the theater for signs of their presence . Then he raised his chin in grim pleasure , secure in the fact that his quarry would die in the fire or be caught as they tried to escape the inferno. go ! " " Lady , I smell petrol . They are going to burn us up , too . Let'sp113With one last glance around , Hassan ordered everyone out , then threw a match , turning the interior into an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to heat up and Ellie knew that they had only seconds before they , too , would be trapped . And even when they escaped , the fire would pursue them through the opened exit . " We 've got to jump for it the instant we open the door , " she coughed . Yacov climbed onto her back and wrapped his arms around her neck once again . She shoved hard against the door and jumped for the ladder even as the flames roared after them and licked the sudden flow of oxygen at the door . Ellie glanced below them and saw Hassan and his men waiting at the entrance of the alley with their arms folded . " We 've got to go up ! " she cried . " They 're waiting for us . " As the flames pursued them up the ladder , Ellie fought her way through the dense , stranglingcloud of smoke . The boy was nearly unconscious , yet still he clung to her . She was aware of her camera banging against the rungs of the ladder as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their only other hope for escape  --  a ladder on the far side of the theater . As Ellie pulled herself onto the roof , already spots were beginning to smolder . She carefully set Yacov on his own feet and surveyedtheir precarious situation . " Roast chicken or sitting ducks , " she said after a moment . Flames lapped up the side of the building behind them , and below waited Hassan and the man who had tried to rape her . She grasped the rail of the ladder that led down to them and stared bleakly at Hassan . Hassan cupped his hand around his mouth and yelled above the roar of the rapidly encroaching flames , " Come down , Miss Warne . You will not be injured . " Her eyes went to the gun in his hand , and the still leering face of the murderer beside him . In an instant she made up her mind . There was no easy way to die , she knew , but to become the main course in a barbecue was not her idea of a noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hefted the boy once again and began a careful descent down the ladder to the waiting grip of Hassan . Then , with a howling scream , the windows on that . side of the building burst and flames licked out all around them , engulfing the middle ten feet of the ladder . Rungs and rails became hot to the touch . Hassan stepped back with a shrug of his shoulders . Well , he had tried to talk them down , at least . This would certainly solve the problem of how to dispose of them.  |p114Clutching  himself in agony , David dragged himself to his feet and leaned against a lightpost as he surveyed the destruction around him . He caught sight of Hassan and the man who had kicked him as they ran around to the far side of the burning theater . He limped after them in time to watch Ellie begin her climb down . To his horror the windows exploded and fire closed in on them . They have n't got much time , he thought . Suddenly he saw the canvas-coveredtroop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran to it . As he climbed aboard and cranked the engine , a British sergeant stuck a muscled arm through the window and grabbed his throat . David drew back his fist and struck him full in the face , knocking him onto the ground . Without looking back , David pushed the accelerator to the floor and ripped toward Hassan and the waitingmen below the ladder . Hassan turned in disbelief at the approaching truck , screaming and jumping clear just before the vehicle slammed into the murdererat his side . The dead Arab lurched onto the hood of the truck , his face pressed against the windshield . David slammed on the brakes , stopping the truck just below Ellie and the boy . The flames licked higher , reaching out to where Ellie waited , frozen in terror , on the ladder . " Ellie ! " he cried at the top of his lungs . " Jump , girl ! Jump onto the canvas top ! " She looked down , in shock and disbelief , certain she recognizedDavid 's voice , but certain it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unconsciousness , and in only a moment the ladder would be too hot to hold . She tried top115focus on the top of the truck . If the canvas would hold against the force of their weight , perhaps there was a chance . " God  --  " she whispered . It was all the prayer she knew . " We 're going to jump now , Yacov . Hold on , boy , hold on . " She leaped into the open air , grasping the arms of Yacov as they fell for what seemed a long time . The boy screamed with Ellie , who expected to miss her target and die . When indeed they did hit , the canvas broke their fall , but it tore away and they crashed to the metal bed of the truck . The world grew dark , and Ellie gasped for breath . When she came to , the ping of bullets dented the tailgate of the rumbling truck . She stayed down and shielded the boy with her body as the vehicle careened wildly through the streets . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes Ellie dared to raise up and look through the torn canvas . A tight spiral of smoke rose above the commercial district and the wail of sirens echoed off the peculiar pink stone that comprised most of the buildings of the city . Behind , a military motorcycle with a sidecar screamed toward them , manned by two British soldiers who glared in deadly earnest through their goggles . They whipped around the troop transportand pulled up alongside the driver of the truck . Only then did Ellie remember the voice that had sounded so much like David 's calling for her to jump to safety . It must have been my imagination , she thought . But she could n't help wondering who was driving the truck and where she and Yacov were being taken . She did not have long to wonder . The truck began the ascent to Hadassah Hospital with . the screaming siren of the motorcycle alongside . Ellie lifted the canvas on the side of the truck and peeked out at the British soldiers . They had their guns trained directly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the driver , but saw only a leathercladarm hanging out the window . Flight jacket , thought Ellie , her heart pounding . Could it truly be David ? She pulled her head back and clutched at her torn and gaping blouse . If she ever expected to.see him again , this would not be how she had envisioned the meeting . The truck screeched to a halt outside of the emergency entrance to the hospital . The two soldiers were immediately on the driver of the truck , prodding with their guns as the door swung open slowly and a pair of lanky Levi-covered legs extended and jumped to the pavement . In disbelief , Ellie watched as David was whirled around at gunpoint and slammed face down onto the hood of the truck.  | " David ! " she screamed . " Ellie , I ... " he looked toward her , only to be slammed down once again on the truck . " Y ' ca n't steal a troop transport and expect t ' get away wi ' it now , mate , " said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " David insisted . " There is an injured boy back here , officer ! " Ellie cried out at the top of her lungs . The soldiers looked at one another , then at David suspiciously . " I 'll go see , " said the driver of the motorcycle as the other shoved the muzzle of his rifle against the back of David 's neck . The soldier sauntered back to the bed of the truck and peered in at Ellie , who was cradling Yacov . He was still unconscious and his face was swollen and distorted . " You do n't look s ' good yourself , ma'am , " he said , scanning her smoke-smudged , torn clothing . David said loudly , " I 'm telling you , if I had n't taken this truck , they 'd be dead . For goodness ' sakes , get the kid into the hospital , will you ? " The driver nodded at the soldier holding David , who reluctantly pulled the gun away . David straightened himself , then rushed back to pick up Yacov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were full of emotion as she handed the limp body of the boy to him . " Are you all right ? " he asked quietly . Emotion flooded her . Tears pushed at her throat as she tried to hold herself . She grasped her blouse and lowered her head , then fell against him . " Oh , David ! " she sobbed . " David . " Suddenly the truck was surrounded by medical attendants . Davidhanded the boy to a team who placed him carefully on a gurney , then raced into the building . " It 's okay , Ellie , " he whispered . " It 's okay , honey . I 'm here . " He folded her in his arms ; then , oblivious to the nurses standing by with a second gurney , he lifted her out of the truck and carried her gently through the doors into the safety of the hospital . The gray smoke of the commercial district gradually disappeared as dusk fell over the city . Moshe ran up the steps of the hospital and burst through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people awaiting word about friends or relatives who had been caught in the riot . Policemen and British officers seemed to be everywhere , taking depositions and moving back and forth among the bustling doctors and nurses.  |p117Moshe  felt angry at himself for not having called Ellie when he first got to Jerusalem , and angry at Ellie for having been so foolish as to go out alone  --  today , of all days ! When he had finally called , he had learned that Howard Moniger had returned and was at the hospital with Ellie . Miriam had no more details than that . Gently , Moshe pushed past a weeping woman at the informationdesk . A harried-looking receptionist glanced up from the buzzingswitchboard . " What is it ? " she asked impatiently . " I need the room number for Ellie Warne . Maybe it 's under Michelle Warne . " Moshe clenched and unclenched his fist nervously . She scanned a list and without looking up said , " Room 312 . " Moshe did not wait for the elevator . Instead , he ran up three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , he strode quickly down a long corridor . Near the end he spotted Howard'sportly form next to a tall , middle-aged British officer with a handlebar mustache . The officer scribbled notes as Howard spoke with deep concern . Worry clouded the professor 's usually cheerful face , and he was still dressed in his khaki clothes and field boots . Moshe wondered if he felt as exhausted as he looked . Howard glanced up and saw Moshe , raising his hand in greeting . " How is she ? " Moshe asked as he walked up , interrupting the officer . " She 's going to make it , Moshe , " Howard put a hand on his arm . " A concussion . Smoke inhalation . A few scrapes and bruises . They 'll keep her here a couple of days . " " Can I see her ? Talk to her ? " Moshe started toward the door . " She 's sedated . " " Oh . " Moshe felt disappointed and wanted only to see that she was alive . He noticed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this ? " he asked abruptly . " Moshe , I 'd like you to meet a friend of mine . Captain Luke Thomas . " The officer nodded and extended his hand . " Ellie took a photograph of her assailants , " the captain explained . " Assailants ? You mean she . . . was she ... " " No , Moshe , she escaped , " Howard said solemnly . " She was with a little boy , it seems , and he led her away . " Moshe turned and without waiting pushed the door open and walked into the half-light of the hospital room . A small lamp was tp118lit by the bedside , and her damp hair glowed like dark copper against her pillow . He stood for a moment and watched her chest rise and fall with her deep and even breathing ; then he stepped quietly to the edge of her bed and took her hand . There were dark circles beneath her eyes , but she slept as peacefully as a child . His anxiety melted away and was replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " My silly girl , " he said softly . " My darling , foolish girl . " She sighed and turned her face toward him and gently squeezed his hand . He wanted to take her in his arms , but was afraid that he would hurt her , so he stood for a full minute gazing at her as she slept . He leaned down to kiss her , but as his lips were about to brush hers , he heard a sound from a darkened corner of the room . " Ahem . " Startled , Moshe whirled around and stared into the darkness , just barely able to see the dim features of the man who had cleared his throat . " Moshe Sachar , are n't you ? " The voice was clearly irritated . " Who is there ? " Moshe asked grimly as he stepped between Ellie and the man in the corner . " I saw you at the meeting this morning . With the Old Man . What are you up to ? I want to know . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed angry now . " She is involved in nothing . " Moshe felt anger welling up in him . " Is that so ? " The hostility turned to sarcasm . " Those jokers were n't chasing her and that kid for nothing , you know . They were after something . " " Look , " Moshe demanded , clenching his fists , " what business is it of yours ? " The dim figure stood up then and stepped out into the light . Moshe instantly recognized the American flyer from the meeting , his face now rigid with fury , his eyes hard and piercing as they glared at Moshe . " I happen to be in love with her , " David answered fiercely . Moshe smiled sarcastically . " Then you have my condolences , Mr. Meyer . David Meyer is the name , is it not ? I thought I recognized the name at the meeting this morning . Ellie told me all about you . " He continued to smile as though he were in on some great private joke . David glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellie sleeping quietly . A trace of tenderness passed across his face and Moshe stepped to the side , blocking his view . " At any rate , " Moshe said with finality , " you have been out of the picture a long time . "  | " Well , I 'm back now . And whatever political garbage you 've got her involved in  --  " " She is involved in nothing , " he interrupted . " She knows nothing of my work ; she must not . " " Good . Because as soon as she 's on her feet , she 's going back to the States . Understand ? " David strode to the door and walked out , leaving Moshe alone by Ellie 's bedside . He turned to her and stroked her forehead , smiling at the trace of freckles across her nose . " He is right , you know , dear one . Because I love you , I must send you home . " Hassan bowed low before the presence of Haj Amin Husseini , Mufti of Jerusalem . He hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handed the package of the young woman 's photographsto the chief bodyguard . In turn , the package was given to the Mufti who opened them without expression , then thumbed through them with perfunctory interest before he lifted his gaze to Hassan . " Well ? " said the Mufti , as if amused . " The girl dropped them as she ran into the tailor shop . Surely they must be of some importance to the Haganah . Perhaps the scroll is some sort of code . " " Unless we have the girl , we have no way of knowing , is that not so , Hassan ? " " Yes , Haj Amin , it is so . If it be the will of Allah  --  " A spark of anger flashed across the Mufti 's placid expression . " It is the will of Haj Amin , Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , Hassan ! " Hassan bowed low again , fearful of the slightly raised voice of his leader . " I beg your forgiveness , Haj . " The Mufti smiled graciously and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper attitude toward the Jewish problem . Such a pity he had not the opportunity to finish what he started . Gerhardt would have killed her had you not stopped him . " " But the boy ... " " He still lives as well , does he not ? " " He is still at the hospital . It seems there has been some damageto his eyes . " " His eyes ? Poor child . He is blind , then . " " Only in one eye , they say  --  the right . " The Mufti pressed his fingers together thoughtfully . " An excellentidea , Hassan . Perhaps you will redeem yourself after all . "  |p120Hassan  stood in dumb confusion , trying to think what idea he might have had that would so please the Mufti . " If the boy is blinded , he shall not be able to identify our top agent , shall he ? " The Mufti continued . " A pity you could not have taken his left eye as well , but we shall hope that you will prove yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anything you request , Haj Amin . " " Well , then , " the Mufti leaned back against a cushion . " Bring us the boy 's left eye as well . Or his body . It makes little difference , although the eye of a Jew would be more amusing for us . And the girl . Kadar says she is beautiful . It would please us . " " As you say , Haj Amin . " The Mufti leafed through the stack of photographs . " As for these , we shall take them to that fool of a Jew in the Jewish Quarter , Rabbi Akiva . Perhaps he can shed light on their meaning . "  |p123Seven  days had come and gone since the British officer had come with news of Yacov . A lonely Shabbat had passed , and there had been no further word on his well-being . Grandfather rose stiffly from his chair and stood silently surveying the tiny apartment . " Too large it seems without you , Yacov , " he muttered to no one . " Too empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's iron cot and paused to touch the pillow . How he longed to touch Yacov 's brow and speak to him of the Torah ! But the Old City was cut off from the New . The gates were blockaded by angry Arabs called in by the Mufti to guarantee that Jews who passed beyond the gates of the quarter did not return to their homes . The Mufti , it seemed , would starve the scholars and the rabbis from the Old City even though they , like him , were against the Zionist radicals who sought a homeland without the Messiah . " Come let us reason together ... " Grandfather hummed . But he feared there was no reasoning left . He could only hope that Rebbe Akiva would be able to reach some sort of agreement with the Mufti that would enable life to resume some normality in the quarter . Then he would be able to travel to the hospital where Yacov lay . Grandfather took his coat from the peg by the door . Slowly he pulled it on , feeling the fragile thinness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was becoming thin and fragile . Yacov was all he had left , all he lived for  --  that and the hope of Messiah . Ellie held Yacov 's small , pale hand and toyed with the wristp124identification bracelet . His head was swathed in bandages , and he had been silent for a long time after she told him why his grandfather was unable to come to visit him . She wondered if he had fallen asleep . Then he sighed and said quietly , " What about Shaul ? Did you find him ? " Ellie looked painfully up at Moshe who stood at the foot of the boy 's bed . Moshe cleared his throat and answered gently , " Perhaps he returned to the Old City . To your home . " " No , " Yacov answered with tears in his voice . " I told him to wait at the butcher shop . He would wait . " " He could have gone back to your grandfather , " Ellie interjectedhopefully . " He is most certainly dead if you did not find him where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow and pulled his hand away . " I can not see to read my prayers or the Torah , " he said finally . " Shaul was just a dog , I know , but I will say Kaddish for him when I am well . " " You and Ellie were very lucky . " Moshe reached out and touched Yacov 's foot through the covers . " The Eternal was with you . " Helpless in the face of the boy 's grief and loneliness , Ellie sat back in her chair and stared bleakly at his bandages . She could not tell him that perhaps he would never see clearly again ; that almost certainly he had lost the vision of one eye and that the other was an uncertainty at this point . " Mr. Sachar , " said Yacov . " They say that you studied in Yeshiva . That you were almost a rabbi ? " " Who told you this ? " Moshe smiled . " The doctor who checks my eyes says that you are a great professor of the ancient languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ min sh'mayo , ve'chaim oleynoo ve'al kol Yisroale , ve'imroo Omaine , " said Moshe , then winked at Ellie . " Omaine , " repeated Yacov . Then after a pause he asked , " Then it is true ? Will you help me say Kaddish for Shaul ? " " We do not know that he is dead , Yacov . Wait , boy . We do not know . " Yacov 's small shoulders seemed to sink into the bed and the eagerness of his voice seemed to fade . " Will you help me with my prayers , then , before you leave ? I can not wear my yarmulke . " " The bandages will do for a head covering , " Moshe sat beside him and patted his hand . " We will pray together . " Ellie stepped back and leaned against the windowsill andp125bowed her head self-consciously as Moshe and the little boy recited words that had been uttered , , by Jews since the days of Moses . Maybe it was not such a big step for Moshe from rabbi to archaeologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew tongue she felt vaguely uncomfortable and somehow distant from Moshe . This was a part of him that she was completely unfamiliar with . What other things about himself did he hold from her , she wondered , watching his broad shoulders rise and fall with the cadence of the prayers , and listening to his confident but tender voice . He belonged here in this land ; she did not . She had begun to wonder if she belonged anywhere . As Rabbi Lebowitz stepped into the chill of the evening air , he began to cough , the pain in his chest growing fierce . Tonight he would speak with Rebbe Akiva . He would ask him if it was not possible for such an old man to receive special permission to leave the confines of the quarter and return after a visit to his grandson . Perhaps Akiva could negotiate with the Mufti . Then he would see Yacov and be comforted . Heaps of sandbags had begun to grow in front of homes and shops . The fear caused by the commercial district riot had boarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grandfather had seen it before and remembered with a spark of hope , Those bad days passed . Soon , so will these . For now , though , bread would have to be rationed and the ritual baths closed for fear of a water shortage . The gate into the courtyard of Akiva 's residence was closed and locked . Grandfather rang the bell and waited for one of his daughters or a servant to answer . Only seconds passed , but the old man rang the bell again impatiently . From the far side of the thick stone wall , he heard a woman 's voice call loudly , questioning what fool would be out alone on the streets at this hour . He recognized the voice of Yehudit , Akiva 's daughter . " It is I , Rabbi Lebowitz , " he called .  --  " I have urgent business with your father . " The hinges of the gate creaked as it swung slowly open . " Shalom , Yehudit , " he greeted the girl . " Shalom , Rebbe Lebowitz . Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man was out in the cold after dark . " Well enough , thank God , amen , " he answered , moving past her purposefully . " Your father is not engaged ? " " He is in the study , Rebbe Lebowitz . He studies the Prophetsp126tonight . " She opened the door and let the old man pass . " A worthy pastime . Perhaps we shall find our answers there . " Yehudit knocked softly on the door to her father 's study . " Father , Rebbe Lebowitz has come . " Grandfather heard the sound of a drawer closing ; then the door swung open . Akiva 's grim face and massive frame blocked the old man 's view of the study . Akiva nodded his head and stepped aside , revealing bookshelves against every wall and a large desk with papers stacked like piles of fallen leaves . " My friend , " Akiva said without feeling as he took his arm and led him to a large leather chair . " Have you any word on your grandson ? Are you well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as for Yacov , " the old man coughed . " Still no word on his condition . " Akiva circled around the desk and sat down in his chair , foldinghis hands across a stack of photographs that lay before him . " What can I help you with ? " Akiva asked without warmth . The old rabbi stared first at Akiva 's sausage-like fingers , then at the photographs they rested on . With a start , he recognized them as the pictures of the scroll that the red-headed woman had shown him the day Yacov had gone with her . He tugged his beard a moment , then gazed at Akiva with astonishment . " Forgive me , Rebbe Akiva , " he said finally . " You are studying Isaiah , I see . You do not have a scroll of the prophet ? " Akiva leaned back and tapped at the stack of Ellie 's scroll photographs with his fingers . " It is nothing . I have been asked to examine these . Photographs of a scroll possibly stolen from a genizah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important citizen . Interesting , but hardly of merit . " " I have seen those very photographs , Rebbe Akiva . They were in the possession of the woman with whom my Yacov left . They are  --  " Grandfather stopped speaking as he noticed Akiva 's expression change to acute interest . " Go on , friend . " " Hardly of merit , as you say ... " the old man finished , feeling vaguely uneasy . How , he wondered , had Akiva come by them ? " Exactly what I shall tell the owner of the scroll . Without merit ... " he shrugged . " Well , " he said , abruptly changing the subject . " We are making some headway in our negotiations , Rebbe Lebowitz . The Arab High Command and the British seem willing to help us if we are willing to make some minor concessions . " " That is what I came to speak with you about , " said the oldp127man , leaning forward in his chair . " Perhaps if I could see Yacov  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Akiva interrupted , " the British will escort our people through the Arab Quarter . " Soon , " he smiled , " you will be able to see your grandson , Reb Lebowitz . " Relief filled the old man and he raised his right hand slightly , " God be praised , " he whispered . " The Mufti knows that we are but poor scholars here , " Akiva sniffed and tugged at his vest . " We have no need of Haganah or weapons in these streets . " " Well said , Rebbe Akiva . Well spoken . Come , let us reason together , " Grandfather nodded . " The Muslims are a reasonable people on the whole , " Akiva said with authority . " The Mufti and I have dealt with such passions before . As always , the passions will die and we will live in peace . " Akiva rose and walked to the door . He called loudly for Yehudit then and she came quickly , her eyes downcast . " Yehudit , can you I not see that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yehudit nodded and disappeared down the hallway . Akiva turned to the old man then , his curiosity about the scrolls once more rising to the surface . " Now , about these photographs ? " he smiled broadly . Grandfather buried the suspicion he felt , instead telling himself that Akiva had given him good news and perhaps he would do well to return favor for favor by giving him information . " The shiksa , the red-haired woman brought them . She works for the American School of Oriental Research . They are goyim , and she had no knowledge of the Hebrew language . I read the passage to her from Isaiah  --  " " What of the scroll itself ? " Akiva interrupted , his eyes narrowing , and again Rabbi Lebowitz felt a vague uneasiness . " She thought that perhaps it was ancient . She spoke of another as the owner . Possibly that the school might purchase it . I told her only what you have concluded : that it is taken from a genizah and probably worthless . Nu ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then looked up and smiled at the old man again . " Ah , but if it were indeed written by the hand of the ancients . . . " he paused . " A chest the size of this desk filled with pounds sterling would not touch the value of such a find . " " An unusual script , Rebbe Akiva , but I think the only thing of value would be the words that are written , not the scroll it is written upon . "  | " Perhaps . " Akiva paused . " That is the view of a true , scholar , Rebbe Lebowitz . " Yehudit brought a steaming pot of tea and served it in delicate china teacups . Grandfather gratefully drank the strong brew , feeling the warmth return to his body . Rebbe Akiva is a truly great man , he thought as they discussed the Torah together . Who else could walk in the ways of peace and find an answer to the terrible threats that surrounded the quarter ? When at last the candle burned low and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellie 's photographs were dim in his mind . The anticipation of seeing Yacovkept him warm . Howard Moniger adjusted the focus of the large microscope on the table . Carefully he examined a fragment of the scroll from the envelope Ellie had marked " Secret Code . " Tiny rivulets and pores on its yellowed surface caused him to draw a deep astonishedbreath . " What is it ? " Moshe asked , drawing nearer . Howard looked up , raised his eyebrows , and stepped aside for Moshe to take his place at the lens . " Have a look for yourself . " Moshe'sat on the stool and peered in at the magnified fragment . " It is leather , " he said simply . " It is leather , not parchment . Howard , do you know what this could mean ? " He could hardly take his eyes away from the microscope , and when at last he looked up , Howard was trembling with excitement . " She said that the old rabbi told her it was the complete book of Isaiah . " Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I think it means ... " " It could well be the most important find of our century , Howard ! " Moshe finished . " Thank God she has the negatives of the photographs . When she feels well enough , we 'll have her make up another set , eh ? " " She 's at it right now , Moshe , " Howard laughed . " Back in the lab . " Eerily surrounded by memories of all that had transpired since she had first developed the pictures of the scroll , Ellie watched the strange letters appear on the blank paper in the developing tray . She rinsed the final prints and hung them carefully to dry , then went to work on the roll of film she had taken on the day of the riot . From negative to print took only a few minutes ; print by print she retraced her trip through the Old City to Yacov 's door , then outp129the Jaffa Gate . The face of Hassan glared back at her from the tray , causing her to shudder involuntarily ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade of the murderer 's knife plunged into his back . She rinsed the prints and tried to look at them with the objectivityof a professional photographer . " The policeman is a bit fuzzy . Forgivable with all the smoke and jostling . But the murder  --  an incredible shot , " she said . Then a sadness swept over her and shelooked away quickly and snapped on the light . It was all reality , not simply an act staged for the benefit of her camera . The memory of the screams crowded into her mind , and once again she felt a wave of nausea . She groped for her stool and sat down , dropping her head to her knees . Her stomach had just begun to settle when there was a soft knock on the door . " You about finished ? " Uncle Howard called through the door . " Almost , " she said , trying to sound cheerful . " Do n't open the door for a second . " She sat up and took a deep breath , careful not to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , forcing a smile . Like excited children on Christmas morning , Moshe and Howardopened the door , then froze dumbfounded at the rows of photographs . Howard let out a low whistle and put his arm around Ellie , who sat pale and shaken on the stool next to him . " What do you think ? " he asked Moshe who caressed the images with his eyes . " Beautiful . The letters drip like honey from the rule lines . I have not ever seen anything quite like it . " He looked up at Ellie in admiration . " You have done well , my little shiksa . " He touched her face tenderly and bent to kiss her forehead , but she stiffened and stood suddenly , moving back to her worktable and the prints of the riot in the rinsing tray . Moshe stood behind her , his hand on her shoulder . His jaw tensed with anger as he took in the face of Hassan and then the tailor as he screamed and died . Smoke and fire and cries of anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moshe 's as Ellie turned away and gazed blankly out the door of the darkroom into the lighted lab beyond . " You saw this , " Howard said heavily , feeling as though he had been kicked in the gut . " Dear God , Ellie ! You were in the middle of it ! " " I thought I 'd send that picture someplace . " She struggled to sound matter-of-fact , trying to dismiss their concern as if the riot had been an everyday occurrence . " Maybe Life magazine or someplace . " She pushed past them both and stalked out of the lab ,  |p130leaving  them to stare at the photographs . " Are you okay , my friend ? " Howard sensed how deeply Moshe seemed to be affected by the pictures . Moshe did not answer ; instead , he turned away and followed Ellie into the lab . " You are right , " he said , gently touching her hair . " These picturesmust be seen . We are sending fragments of the scroll to New York for analysis . Your photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Truly you are a remarkable woman . " He kissed her trembling lips , then walked down the hall to the study . Uncle Howard leaned against the stainless steel table and fixed a steady gaze on Ellie . " Are you all right , child ? " he asked tenderly . Ellie nodded . " Sure . " " Sure ? " he asked again . " I guess I just ... " she began haltingly , choking back a flood of tears that wanted to escape . " I feel so empty . I 've been living in some kind of fairy tale , Uncle Howard . I never watched a man die before , you know . Death is so  --  " She stopped , unable to find the words . " Real . " " I saw it . I felt it follow me from rooftop to rooftop . It chased me . It scared me . I 'm not ready for it , and nobody who died down on that street was ready for it or expected it . " Howard walked toward her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his chest and tears began to flow silently from her eyes . " There , there , " he wiped the tears away . " Are n't you scared , Uncle Howard ? " she asked in a little girl voice . " No , dear . Every day I piece together the fragments of someone'slife . No matter that they lived in the first century  --  they were alive , like you and me . I live with death 's reality , but I 'm not afraid of it . God says our lifetime is not much more than a breath of wind . In all of eternity we are a tiny second , the blink of God 's eye . Still , He sees us and cares for us . And He 's got a reason for our being here . " Ellie pushed herself away . " How can you believe that ? What possible purpose could that little man 's death serve ? And what difference could it make that I be there ? " " I do n't know , Ellie . And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . But I 'm going to pray that somehow what seems so wrong and senseless now will be used for some purpose . " He rubbed his forehead wearily . " It all sounds so trite , does n't it ? "  |p131She  looked away , avoiding his gaze . " I do n't know . I just have to think where I fit in all of this . " " I 'm sorry , honey . I would n't have asked you to come if I had known you 'd have to see any of this . I 'll see to it that you get back to California as soon as possible . " She laughed sarcastically . " Back to the real world ? " " Back where you are safe . I think it 's best . " " One thing about me , Uncle Howard , I 've always managed to play it safe . I just did n't know there was any other game . " " I feel responsible , " he said , shaking his head . " It 's nobody 's fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God or somebody has some kind of plan for my being here , either . I 'll make my own plans and learn to live with them , that 's all . " She walked slowly out of the room , the face of the tailor vivid in her mind.  |p132Moshe  did not look up from the microscope when Ellie entered the study . He continued to gaze with unseeing eyes at the pattern on the leather fragment . Everything else seemed of little importance after seeing the face of Ibrahim Hassan staring up at him from Ellie 's developing tray . He only hoped that the rage he felt did not give away the fact that he did indeed know the identity of the gaptoothedpoliceman . But why had Ellie been the target of his brutal pursuit ? He sighed deeply , inhaling her fragrance as she stood silently behind him . Her association with him had brought her under the scrutiny of a man like Hassan , and that realization made her seem suddenly more dear to him , as vulnerable as a child . A dull ache throbbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head . He sat up straight and moved his head from side to side , trying to loosen the tension that gripped him . " Headache ? " Ellie asked , rubbing her fingers gently on his temples . " Hmmm , " he answered . " The back of my neck . " " Are you okay , Moshe ? " she asked , sensing his uneasiness . " I think you should return to the United States , " he said to her as she massaged his neck with her fingers . " You too ? " she smiled . " Why ? " " It is not safe for you here . " He turned and lifted his eyes to hers . " There 's that lovely word again . Safe . " " Anyone would be a fool who did not value safety , Ellie . "  | " And you 're no fool , are you , Moshe ? " There was an irritated push to her voice that startled him , then made him smile . " That 's what I like about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're so in focus , so safe . I mean , you 've grown up around stuff like this , have n't you ? Riots ? Beatings ? " " It has been a fact of life here in Jerusalem . " Something clicked inside Ellie and her irritation swelled to disdain . " And what do you do about it ? " " I simply live . " " With your books and scrolls and precious clay tablets . While people are suffering and dying , you 're safe ! " Moshe smiled . " As long as it does not affect one 's life , is it necessary to be anything else ? " " I do n't know , " she said angrily . " I have to figure that out . But I 'll tell you , Moshe , you 're a Jew . You grew up here , and never once have you talked to me about politics or this Mufti or the Jews coming out of those horrible places in Europe . All you care about is that I got pictures of that scroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out how you can grow up here and not care at all . At least I have an excuse . I mean , I 'm from Los Angeles . " He laughed at her final sentence , and she wished she had n't mentioned L.A. " Go ahead and laugh , " she said . " What are you saying ? " He reached out and took her hand . She pulled it away and sat down in the chair farthest away from him . " I do n't know yet . But maybe my idea of what I respect in a man is changing . Maybe what I can respect about myself is chang-ing . " " Ellie , I ... " Moshe wanted to tell her of his other life ; about the Ave Maria and his years with the Haganah . But he remembered his sacred vow of secrecy and paused , frowning as he turned back toward the microscope . " The work you did on the scrolls is very fine , " he said finally . " Is that all you care about ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood abruptly and glared at his back as he sat hunched over the microscope . He is a man without conviction , she thought , without courage . " Maybe we should n't see each other for a while , Moshe . Socially , I mean . Not until I decide what I 'm going to do . " Moshe gripped the edge of the table , wanting to grab her and hold her to himself and tell her everything he felt and believed and that the depth of his convictions forced him to silence . Instead , hep134nodded and said quietly , " Whatever you think is best . " Ellie stalked out , certain that Moshe did not even care for her . She went straight to her room and slammed the door loudly behind her as if making some final statement . Then she threw herself across her bed and took her alarm clock off the night table . It was only seven in the evening , and she suddenly felt like a jailed prisoner . She could not leave the house , and with Moshe out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she had to look at him too soon , her anger and resolve might melt away beneath the steady gaze of his ebony eyes . She wanted to enjoy her anger , to hate him for his apathy , to blame him for his complacency . It was much easier than sorting through the other emotions that assaulted her , pushing and crowding out all the self-images she had clung to so fiercely . She thought about David then . Where had he gone ? He had been with her at the hospital , she remembered that . What comfort she had felt as he stroked her hair ! It had not been a dream or a hallucination ; after she had awakened she had asked Uncle Howard about him , and received a note scrawled in David 's cramped handwriting . Ellie took it from the nightstand and read it for the hundredthtime : Wish I could be the first face you see when you open your eyes . I 'll be back in a few days and we 'll go dancing . D.The certainty of his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she should see him when and if he did call . After all , she had only just begun to walk through a day without thinking of him . Ellie sat up at the soft knock on her door . " It 's open , " she said , winding her alarm clock . Miriam poked her face through the door and frowned . " You are for bed ? " she asked . " That young man who comes the other day is here for you . I shall tell him you are for bed . " " Do n't tell him that ! " Ellie shot back , imagining David 's response to Miriam 's broken English . " Do you mean David Meyer , Miriam ? " " Yes , yes , " Miriam repeated . " The very same David . You will see him when Professor Sachar is here ? " she whispered hoarsely . " Yes . Tell him I 'll be out in a few minutes . " Miriam shook her head in disapproval and ducked back out , muttering in Arabic.  |p135Ellie  freshened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her two suitors would meet . " It never hurts to keep a manguessing , " she murmured , running a brush through her hair . She smiled her most winning smile into the mirror , then , spraying herself with lilac , went to greet David . He was standing as she entered the parlor , hat in hand . Inhaling deeply , he took a step toward her and reached out to take her inhis arms . " Gee , you smell terrific , " he said . She stepped out of his grasp and said coolly , " It 's good to see you again , David . What brings you to Jerusalem ? " " Do n't play games with me , Ellie , " he demanded , stepping toward her . " Not after the other day . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " She sat down and crossed her legs . " Have a seat . " She pointed to a chair on the other side of a coffee table from hers . He plopped down angrily . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember all the stuff you said to me ? " Ellie felt a blush color her cheeks . " No , David , I honestly do n't . That was hardly the time or the occasion . " She stopped . " Listen , I 'm glad you came along when you did . I 'm grateful . But my life is not the same as it was before . I do n't know that I want to be in-volved . " " It 's that other guy , is n't it ? " he demanded . " Things are not the same , David . I do n't know why you 're here , but I 'm grown up now . If you 're looking for a good time , I 'm sure there are plenty of  --  " " I wanted to see you  --  that 's why I 'm here . You 're not the only one who can change , you know . Let 's go home , babe . Let 's get out of here and back to where we belong . " f " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of irritation . She did n't like being called babe , and she was put out by his possessive attitude . " I do n't know about you , but I 'm kind of partial to Frisco . We can work out the details later . I just want to get you out of here , okay ? " " Why ? " " Because I  --  " He wanted to tell her he loved her , but the wordsstuck in his throat . He had been able to say it to that Moshe fellow as she lay unconscious in the hospital . Why , he wondered , is it so hard with her sitting up wide awake and beautiful across from me ? " Listen , " he changed his approach , " I could use a few laughs tonight . How about my offer ? "  | " You mean the note ? About taking me dancing ? I thought it was a summons , " she said coolly . She always had a way of making him irritated faster than any other woman he had ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want to go dancing or not ? " Moshe walked by in the hallway behind David and looked in as he made his way to the front door . Ellie caught his eye , then turned back toward David . " I 'd love to go dancing with you , David . " Moshe stepped quickly out of her view , hoping that she did not see the pang of jealousy on his face . " Great ! " David exclaimed . " Just a minute , " she said a bit too loudly as she rose and walked toward the hallway . " I ' 11 let Uncle Howard know we 're going . Where are we going ? The King David ? " David could n't understand the sudden change of heart , but he was relieved all the same . " Sure . They 've got a nice little band there , " he called after her , unaware that she had followed Moshe . " Going so soon , Moshe ? " she asked , stepping out the front door ? " I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night talking about the scroll . " Moshe did not answer her , but reached around and closed the door behind her . He searched her face and raised his hand to her cheek . " I can understand your lack of respect for me right now . But it is not like you to toy with a man 's heart . Be careful , my love  --  things are not always as they seem . " Ellie felt a rush of shame at the game she was playing with this gentle and loving scholar . " Moshe , " she said haltingly , " I ... we need to talk . Will you call me ? " " I am leaving the city for a while . University business . We are sending the fragments out  --  along with your photographs . " He held a package up . " Your friend . . . David , is it not ? He will likely be flying me to Tel Aviv in the morning . " " You know him ? " she asked , astonished . " We met briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention the first time he had met David in the Old Man 's office . " When will you be back ? " She looked him full in the face , noticingthe way the streetlamps cast shadows that emphasized his rugged good looks . She suddenly did not want him to go . " A week , possibly . I hope no more than that . We shall talk then , my little shiksa . " He bent low and kissed her on the lips , gently at first . Then he pulled her tight against him and searched her face with a passion in his eyes that she had not seen before . " Perhapsp137you are more Sabra than you know , " he whispered ; then he kissed her again with a force that left her feeling weak against her will . " That felt more like hello than good-bye , " she said breathlessly , pushing away from his embrace . " I will bring you a surprise when I return . " He turned and strode briskly toward the lights of King George Avenue as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Howard were talking quietly together when she returned to the front room . Uncle Howard looked up at her , then stood with the politeness of a man raised in a more courteous age . David , she noted , remained seated . A frown creased his brow and she guessed that Uncle Howard had told him Moshe had been here only moments before . " Seeing Moshe out , were you , child ? " Uncle Howard asked . " David thought you had gone in search of me . " " Moshe is leaving in the morning , " she said , ignoring the pout on David 's face . " I did n't know . " " And did he tell you where he was going ? " Howard cast a quick glance toward David , who did not look up . " Something about the university , " answered Ellie , wondering about the tone of Uncle Howard 's voice . " Did n't he tell you ? " " Yes , he told me . " His eyes were still fixed on David as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight jacket . " If we 're going to have any time before curfew , we 'd better get going , " he abruptly changed the subject . " Good to see you again , Professor . " " Of course , of course . You 'll be at the King David Hotel , then ? " He walked them to the door . " Things seem quiet enough tonight , do n't they ? " The jovial tone had returned to Uncle Howard 's voice . " I 'll wait up for you , " he said as he helped Ellie on with her coat . " Do n't do that , Uncle Howard , " Ellie protested . " Nonsense . I have work to do , regardless . " Then he turned to David and said solemnly , " I expect you will not want to be late either , seeing that you will be flying early tomorrow . " Uncle Howard seemed to search David 's face knowingly . Ellie felt as though she were on the outside of a conversation in which every line had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kissed Uncle Howard lightly on the cheek and took David by the arm , " let 's get going . " David led her to an old green Plymouth parked across the street and opened the door for her . As she stooped to get in , she was met by a barrage of wet and lavish dog kisses on her face . There ,  |p138in  the front seat , whining and shaking with delight , was Shaul . She wrapped her arms around his shaggy ruff and pulled the big dog onto her lap , laughing with surprise and joy . " Oh , Shaul ! " she cried , " you mutt ! Where have you been ? " David slid in behind the wheel . " He 's been sharing a one-room apartment with me and Michael , " he said wryly , cranking the engine . " I 'm evicting him . Think you can put him up ? " " Where did you find him ? " She squealed in amazement as Shaul nuzzled closer to her . " At the butcher shop . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so glad this is the right dog . I thought maybe I 'd picked up the wrong mutt or something . I had a terrible time getting him into the car . It took me and Michael both . I almost gave up on him , but I looked at him and I thought I had seen him someplace before . ' You know , ' I said to Michael , ' that looks like the same mutt that ran off with your wallet at the celebration . And I bet Yacov is the kid that picked your pocket ! ' So Michael went into the butcher shop and came out with some corned beef , put it into the backseat , and the dog went for it . I think he hopes the boy will give him back his wallet if he gives back the dog . " Ellie stared in wonder at the wide grin on David 's face . " But how did you find him ? " she asked again . " You told me where he was . At the hospital . You do n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Hotel . " No , I really do n't . " David pursed his lips and frowned . " You said a lot of other things to me , too . I guess I 'm going to have to remind you . " Her eyes filled with tears of joy as she thought of Yacov in the hospital and how happy he would be to hear that his shaggy friend was safe . Ellie reached out and put her hand on David 's arm . " You are wonderful . Wonderful . " " Yeah , now it 's coming back to you , " he smiled at her . " Rememberanything else ? " He raised his eyebrows in happy expectation . Ellie felt her heart swell with tenderness for David . He was , as he had always been , so eager to be loved and admired . And it was not difficult for her to do either . " I remember , " she began haltingly , " that you were there . Somehow it was your voice I heard in the darkest moment of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , well , I 'd like to be part of your happiest moments , too , y'know ? "  |p139Ellie  stroked Shaul 's head and weighed each thought and emotioncarefully . " You have already been that , David . I love you , " she said softly . " But I do n't know if I am in love with you anymore . " " I can take care of that . " His voice was husky and his words full of memories . " That 's what scares me . I do n't know if I want to go back , David . I 've had time to think about us and there was so much that was n't right . I have been happy here . " " It 's that Moshe guy , is n't it ? " The joy dropped from his voice . " Partly  --  maybe . I just do n't know . " She glanced up in time to see that they had passed the massive stone structure of the King David Hotel . " What are you doing ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish Agency building and then onto Ellie 's street in Rehavia . They passed the Moniger home without stopping , then drove on another five minutes in silence until David passed two men on guard near a pile of sandbags . He stopped the car at the edge of what appeared to be a plowed field across from the Monastery of the Cross , set the hand brake , and sat staring straight ahead into the darkness for a moment . Then he turned toward her . " I want to tell you something , " he said awkwardly . Then he stopped as if choosing his words carefully . In the darkness she could hear the ticking of his wristwatch . " David , I think we should go , " she said finally . " Not yet . Please . Come with me . " He got out of the car and came around to open her door . She continued to sit , feeling uncomfortableat the air of mystery in David 's voice . " Please , Ellie . " She got out reluctantly and he led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed . He unlocked its double doors and swung them wide , then flicked a switch , dimly lighting both the shed and the field . Inside was a tiny blue and white airplane . " Help me push her out , " said David , grabbing a wing . " Why ? What are you doing , David ? " Ellie allowed the irritation she felt to creep into her voice . He rolled the plane onto the field as she stood and watched . " Come on , " he opened the cockpit door for her . " I want to show you where I live . " He smiled in the soft light , and against her better judgment she climbed in . David started the sputtering little engine and taxied a few feet before rattling down the bumpy runway so slowly that Ellie did not believe they would ever get off the ground . Suddenly , in a rush that flipped her stomach , they lifted off and began the slow climb that took them over Mount Scopus and thep140now-sleeping Hadassah Hospital . David banked the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb until the lights of the city winked up at them like tiny stars . Ellie gazed out the cockpit window at the millions of stars above them . David looked at her and grinned . " This is where I live , " he said finally . " Here I am King David . How do you like my kingdom ? " The soft glow of the instrument panel shone on his face , and Ellie realized that there was something different about his expression . She had never seen him like this before . " It is very beautiful , " she said matter-of-factly . " You know , you 've never taken me flying before . " David pointed to a tiny cluster of lights on the black velvet below them . " Bethlehem , " he said . " The way the angels must have seen it the night Christ was born . No guns . No anger . Nobody hating anybody else . Peace on earth . At least that 's the way it looks from up here . " He turned to her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the world like that tonight because I want to tell you , Ellie  --  " he paused , groping for the words . " I want you to know , I want to spend my life with you . " He gulped , then quickly looked away from her steady gaze . " You 've never said that to me before . Thank you , " she said , privately wondering if he had said it too late , if it really mattered anymore . " You can say it up here , where the world is so distant . It all looks so beautiful . But it is n't . The reality is that down there people are standing in line to wipe each other off the face of the earth . " She motioned toward the broad glitter of the Milky Way . " This is beautiful , David , but you ca n't live up here . Sooner or later your little plane has to come down . If this is the only place you feel really alive , then I ca n't join you . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both standing flat-footed on the asphalt , then maybe what you feel for me is n't real love . " She turned her head away from him and stared at the tiny lights of an automobile as it crept through the streets of Jerusalem . " I 'm sorry , " she said feeling suddenly confused and foolish . " I do n't understand what 's wrong with me . I 've wrecked your big moment , have n't I ? " " It 's okay , " he answered quietly . " I had it coming . Things have n't exactly been normal for you the last few days . " Ellie wondered if anything would ever be the same for her again . " It 's just that I never knew before . . . " Again a rush of sadness choked off her words . " It 's okay , " he reassured her , furious at himself that he had notp141waited until the shock of her ordeal had worn off . " I do n't know what I expected , coming to Palestine like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , as the plane dipped low above the city . " I came for you , " he said simply . As Ellie , climbed beneath the cool sheets she thought about Moshe hiding from commitment behind his ancient writings and David trapped between the Milky Way and the tiny twinkling lights of earth . Maybe she had been trapped , too . The reality of life simply did not measure up to her hopes and illusions . Hot tears ran down her cheeks , and she wished that somehow the soft , peaceful lights of the heavens and the winking stars of Jerusalem could melt together as one heaven and earth . " But that 's not going to happen , " she whispered into the darkness . She thought about Uncle Howard then  --  so full of peace and joy ; so certain of his life . " God , " she said at last , " can you see me ? " Somewhere in the distance , the popping of gunfire raked the stillness of the night . Ellie reached down to stroke the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hassan nursed the short brown stub of his Turkish cigarette . He inhaled the harsh smoke and tapped his cheek lightly , watching with satisfaction as a string of tiny smoke rings popped from his lips , then drifted into the lobby in ever-expanding 0 's . It was a trick he had learned from a tall blond lieutenant when they attended Nazi S.S. Commando school together . Hassan glanced at the face of his German-made watch . It was already 6:15 ; Gerhardt was late . Residents of the Hotel Semiramis , in the suburb of Katamon , scurried through the lobby on their way to and from dinner . From the worn red-velvet chair in the corner , Hassan studied their faces as they stopped at the mahogany desk to check with the small , bespectacled manager for messages . Some , he guessed , were Arabs who had lived in the second-story flats above the shops of the Jewish commercial district . When the district had burned , they had fled to the safety of Hotel Semiramis with its potted palms and worn red floral carpets and cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly mixed Arab and Jewish neighborhood on the outskirts of the raging fanaticism of the all-Muslim quarters , and the burning Zionism of an all-Jewish district , no doubt they felt safe . There was moderation in Katamon . After all , Jews and Arabs lived side by side here . Hassan smiled to himself at the innocence of these Christian Arabs . Haj Amin had marked the peaceful neighborhood of Katamonfor his own . Soon Gerhardt would come , and the hotel would become the assembly plant for his packages of TNT and the clever letter bombs that tore the hands from anyone unfortunate enoughp143to open one . Then there were the big surprises that Haj Amin and Gerhardt had planned for Jewish Jerusalem . In a small , neatly furnishedsuite overlooking the street , every detail would be planned to perfection . Far from being the refuge of the Christian Arab middle-class , the hotel had become the headquarters of the Mufti 's terrorist activities . A large group of men and women burst through the double doors , two old women bundled tightly in shawls followed by grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tall stoop-shouldered man in a tweed suit stopped and rang the desk bell , then leaned on the counter as the rest of the group clustered in front of the wrought-iron grate of the elevator . Two small boys haggled over the right to push the elevator button as the two old women talked above their heads . Hassan had no illusions that the battles about to be fought would be fought for their benefit . No , all would be won for the glory of Haj Amin Husseini , Mufti of Jerusalem and future ruler of the united land of Palestine . Haj Amin was a name these people feared , and in the end , they would be the ones who would lose . They were Arabs , yes , but their kind would be gone before the final line was written . In the end it made little difference . Hassan gasped and turned as he felt an iron grip on the shoulder . The grim face of Gerhardt stared down on him . He wore the same heavy tweed coat he had worn the night they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A broad-rimmed fedora was pulled low over the cruel steely gaze of his ice-blue eyes . " Well , my friend , " he said softly . " Are you ready to finish the job you left undone ? " Casually , Hassan inhaled the cigarette one last time , then flicked the ash onto the carpet and crushed out the red-hot tip with his fingers . He dropped the remaining stub in the shirt pocket of his police uniform . " The boy is still at Hadassah  --  an easy target . I thought perhaps we might have a bite to eat before we finish him . " " You can eat later , " Gerhardt growled . " Why the impatience , my friend ? " Hassan rose and faced him as he pulled on his coat . " It is the impatience of Haj Amin that I should worry about , were I you . " Gerhardt smiled grimly and turned toward the stairway leaving Hassan without an appetite . The night was cold and the stars hung like fragments of ice against the sky . Hassan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished that he had stolen an enclosed vehicle rather than this open jeep . He passed through the Arab neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah at the foot of Mount Scopus . He felt a sense of satisfaction as he looked at the blazing lights of Hadassah Hospital atop Scopus . He would be able , he was sure , to finish his assignment , then fade into the anonymity of Sheikh Jarrah before the last drop of the boy 's blood had spilled onto the floor . He shifted into first gear as he rounded the last curve before the climb up Mount Scopus . Commanding the highest ground in the area , the hospital and the Hebrew University would certainly be a Jewish stronghold in the days ahead . But , Hassan noted with satisfaction , their locations deep inside Arab suburbs would make them easy enough to strangle . He would mention it to the Mufti when he reported the final disposal of the little Jew witness . He glanced at his watch  --  nearly seven o'clock . He pulled into the parking lot of the hospital and parked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice the army jeep there among so many others . He set the brake , then ran his hand quickly along the side of his leg to his boot top and the narrow handle of the dagger hidden there . All in all , he thought , this should not take more than a few minutes . He hopped from the jeep and strode purposefully past a British guard who saluted smartly when he touched the brim of his hat . It was still early when he passed through the doors of the hospital 's main entrance . Perhaps there was even time for a quick cup of coffee in the cafeteria to warm his hands after the drive through the chill night air . The crowd in the first floor hospital cafeteria had thinned considerably . Hassan sat in the far corner across from a group of three buxom nurses who gossiped and giggled throughout their break . Hassan took a last bite of strudel and slurped down his coffee , cursing Gerhardt for the urgency with which he had sent him to finish off the little Jew . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat a good meal . The lights in the rooms were only now winking out as shifts of doctors and nurses came and went . He scraped the tasteless cafeteria food to the side of his plate and stacked the silverware and coffee cup on top . Then he left the sterile room for the now nearly empty lobby . He considered taking the elevator to the fifth floor , but thought better of it , certain that some sharp-eyed nurse would stop him at her station . He pushed a heavy swingingp145door marked " STAIRWAY " and began the slow climb to the pediatricward , room 529 , where the boy rested . His footsteps echoed loudly in the stairwell ; once a nurse pushed open a door on the floor above him and skipped past him on her way down . " I hate waiting for that elevator , " she said cheerily . Hassan nodded and tipped his hat but said nothing in reply . He hoped the boy would be sleeping soundly . It would certainlymake his task easier . A quick slash of the knife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead the kosher way  --  his blood draining painlessly and silently from his body . From a small glass porthole reinforced with wire , Hassan watched as a nurse rattled down the dimly lit corridor with a metal cart full of medication . He stared at the large red numbers and the arrows on the wall pointing the way to the little Jew 's room . Rooms 520 to 529 were to his left opposite the direction the nurse had taken . He smiled at the wave of excitement he felt ; then he bent and touched the handle of his knife once again . He pushed the door open a crack and watched with satisfactionas the nurse disappeared around a corner . Soft light reflected on the shiny floor in front of the nurses ' station . Hassan was out of the view of the nurse who sat behind the large desk flipping through the pages of a magazine . He slipped from the stairwell into the corridor , careful not to let the leather soles of his boots squeak on the freshly scrubbed tiles . He walked close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cursing the fact that 529 was at the very end of the hall . A child swathed in white moaned as he passed the open door of room 525 . He glanced in at the bars around the bed and imagined first the red blood of Yacov Lebowitz soaking the sheets and then the panic that would echo through this hallway when the deed of Ibrahim El Hassan was discovered with the first light of morning . He wished that he could be on hand to watch , and even toyed with the idea of returning to the hospital in the morning . The wooden door of room 529 was closed . Hassan gingerly pushed it open , knowing that the boy 's eyes were bandaged and that he would not be awakened by the light . A cruel smile danced across his lips , and he felt intoxicated as he slipped the knife from his boot top and tiptoed into the room . Then his smile faded . There before him in the darkness was not the bed of one small Jewish child , but twenty beds occupied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumping hisp146arm hard on a large metal crib . His knife clattered to the floor , and a child cried out at the noise . Hassan backed up behind the door in anticipation of a nurse scuttling into the room . Beads of sweat formed on his brow and trickled down his temples into his collar . Slowly , his eyes began to adjust to the semi-darkness , and when no nurse appeared and the only sound was the steady breathing of the children , he allowed himself to relax and step forward . He would , he decided , simply search the sleeping faces . He tiptoed to the first bed , then turned away immediately as he noticed a small leg encased in plaster and raised upwards in traction . The next bed held a little girl whose long dark hair fanned over the pillow . As he peered down at her she moaned and thrashed as if sensing something evil was near . He stepped away , brushing the foot of her bed with his fingers . " Two , " he counted wordlessly . Then he lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his breath causing the little one to turn away . There were no bandages on this child 's eyes , and Hassan crept stealthily to the next . Before him was the tiny form of a child whose head was swathed in bandages . He was in luck , he felt , and toyed with the blade of the knife before he raised the limp arm to check the identification band . " I want a drink of water , " said a sleepy voice . Hassan dropped the arm and raised his knife to strike . " What is your name , boy ? " Hassan whispered softly . " Michael . I want a drink . " " Shut up , " Hassan whispered menacingly . " Where does Yacov Lebowitz sleep ? " " On the end , " came the whimpered reply . Hassan straightened himself and , touching the foot of each bed as he passed , stole to the bed on the end , nearest the window . There in the light and shadow of the city lights , he could make out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said with a cruel edge to his voice . Then he touched the neck of his victim and raised his knife to strike . The child he had awakened cried out loudly , and Hassan hesitated a moment . Then Yacov awakened with a start and bolted upright . " Shaul ! " he cried loudly . " Shaul ! " In an instant the ward was a mass of crying children . Hassan backed against the window , then as the door was flung open and the harsh lights of the ward flicked on , he smashed the window and lunged onto the fire escape . He clambered down the tiny steel ladder to the second floor balcony , then opened the window and slipped into the darkness of a deserted room . He sprinted toward the door and into the hallway , then ran to the emergency stairs , smashing into the same nurse who had greeted him only a few minutes before . As he reached the lobby floor , he paused barely a second , then strode out quickly . " There 's a terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British soldiers . As they ran toward the stairs andelevator , he walked calmly out to the stolen jeep and disappeared into the streets of Sheikh Jarrah.  |p148Moshe  paced the length of the Old Man 's office , glancing fromtime to time at the white head bowed over the stack of photographs . " And you think the girl is trustworthy ? " Ben-Gurion said at last . " Beyond doubt , " Moshe said without hesitation . " An American journalist as a member of the Haganah would be helpful , to say the least . " He took his glasses from his nose and rubbed a hand across his eyes . " Then approach her . Cautiously . But do speak with her . There is only one way the world will hear our voice , that is if someone else shouts our cause . " He thumped the photographs . " I see your old friend Ibrahim Hassan was a part of the riot . " " You are surprised ? " " Perhaps we should take you out of Jerusalem for a while ? Another assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel in Europe ? Arms Procurement . " " Leave the travel to Arazi . I am Palestinian ; even more , I am from the dust of Jerusalem . I can deal with Hassan . " " What about the woman , Miss Warne ? Have you considered her safety ? " The Old Man leaned back in his chair and eyed Moshe knowingly . " I have thought of nothing else for days . " Moshe sat heavily in the chair opposite him . " You feel strongly about her , then ? " Moshe nodded , " Unfortunately . I am certain to lose her if I do not tell her of my involvement . " He stared miserably at the map of Palestine hanging behind the Old Man . " She has become commit/ted to the cause , you see , and suddenly holds the Moshe Sachar she knows in contempt . " " Well , then , she would find a way to stay even without you , would n't she ? Of course you could lose her . As she could lose you ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that is a chance you must take . " " She is not yet sure what it is that has changed in her heart . She does not know what has awakened , but I saw it in her eyes : She has become one of us . " " Then you must let her be what God has made her . You must accept the risk or destroy what you feel in your heart for her . Listen to an old man , my young friend . There is always risk in love , nu ? " " I have not spoken to her of love , " Moshe said , looking down at his shoes , then back at the unrelenting gaze of David Ben-Gurion . " Ha ! " the Old Man exclaimed . " And you are worried that she will think you lack commitment ! " he said sarcastically . " Perhaps she is right , eh ? " " I had not thought of it like that . " Moshe scratched his head and stood . " Perhaps you are right . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And as for these other matters , which seem less important than the heart "  --  he passed his hand over the piles of papers that cluttered his desk  --  " they are in God 's hands . I know that God promised all of Palestine to the children of Israel . I do not know what borders He set . I believe that they were wider than the ones proposed . If God will keep His promise in His own time , our business as poor humans who live in a difficult age is to save as much as we can of the remnant of Israel . That means that for now , Moshe , we must smuggle in a different cargo than we have in the past . We will not last a week without defense to hold our ground . " He gazed seriously at Moshe , who had begun to pace once again . " Sit down , will you ? " He sounded irritated . Moshe resumed his seat and stared at a smaller map of Jerusalem to the right of Ben-Gurion . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Moshe smiled grimly . " I have spent the week speaking with area commanders . We have a very short supply of weapons and ammunition hidden in the New City . The Old City seems hopeless . Hopeless , " he said again . " The very word Shimon used . So what is the situation ? " " We have ten men inside the walls . Yeshiva students  --  determinedbut untrained . There are only fourteen rifles , antiques from the First World War , hidden in a cellar wall there , with enough ammunition for possibly three rounds each , if the boys even know how to fire the guns . "  | " And the civilians ? " " Already the Mufti has made it impossible for them to pass into the New City . There are 2,500 ultra-orthodox inside those walls . They depend on this agency for their food , but there is no possible way that we can deliver anything to them , " Moshe frowned . " Are you suggesting then that we begin by evacuating the Old City ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In the end time , lambs will lie down with lions . Even then I will want to be a lion , I think . I am asking you for an opinion . What is to be done ? " The Old Man glared at him . " Strategically , the Old City is a waste of time . We will have enough difficulty holding on to Jerusalem as a whole . But spiritually it is the center of our being . Even those who do not believe in God recognize the value of the Old City . " " Yes . It has changed little over the centuries . And now that the synagogues and ghettos of Europe have been wiped off the face of the earth , what else do we have but Jerusalem ? " " Then I say , somehow , we must make lions of the lambs behindthose walls . Do what you can do . Talk with the British High Command before that vulture Akiva strikes some sort of bargain with the Mufti . If , on humanitarian grounds , you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You think you can smuggle in the necessities of survival ? " " Well , it is certain that Arazi and the others must transport the weapons we need into Palestine first . But once they get them to the New City , I can find a way to mix bullets and beans . I believe that we must try to save the Old City for the sake of our spirit . " " It is certain , " the Old Man said with an air of finality , " that the eyes of the world are focused on the Faithful City . And Moshe  --  " He tapped the photographs . " Your friend Miss Warne may well capture the image that they see . " Moshe bit his lip thoughtfully , realizing the danger that she would be placed in if she recorded the struggle . He wondered once again if he could ask her . " That square mile of earth and the Wailing Wall are what we had left after Titus destroyed everything two thousand years ago . How can we lose that without a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am glad you do not agree with Shimon . And now , what about these scrolls of yours ? " " Are you asking Moshe the archaeologist , Moshe the Jew , or Moshe the Zionist ? " he laughed . " All three . "  | " I believe that they , too , may be the last remnant of Judaism of two thousand years ago . " Ben-Gurion drew an astonished breath . " You believe they date from before the Diaspora ? Incredible . " " If that is so  --  and I must say if  --  their discovery at this time in history , when our people return from the four corners of the earth , is significant . Somehow I can not help but believe that these ancient fragile writings may be as important as the Old City itself . They , like us , have been hidden from our legacy for these two thousand years . And today when we most need hope , God has reminded us of His ancient promises . " " This is Moshe the Jew speaking ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photographs of the scroll . " And what does the Zionist say ? " " We will know shortly if Professor Moniger 's and my belief about their authenticity is correct . If it is , then we have on our side a powerful weapon . We have the Word of God . There are some who will listen ; we should let the world know what has been found . " The Old Man straightened the stack and handed it back to Moshe . " We need everyone we can muster on our side right now , my friend . Especially God , nu ? " Moshe leafed through the pages once again , skimming the words of Isaiah . " As well as His friends . " " Does Professor Moniger share your enthusiasm over the significance of the scroll ? " " It was he who first mentioned it to me last night . He has lived in Jerusalem for twenty-eight years . He is a Christian , but also a Jew at heart . He is a good man , at any rate . " The Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane to catch ? And a ship to catch tomorrow night , I believe ? " Moshe nodded , rose , and shook his hand . " Shalom . " " And shalom to that hairy ape , Ehud , eh ? " Moshe left his office , filing through a crush of men and women waiting to see Ben-Gurion . If there is truly to be a nation of Israel , Moshe thought , surely this will be its Prime Minister . The Old Man 's door was never closed , nor was his heart . For the first time in days , Moshe felt lighthearted . He was at least clear as to the course of action he would take with Ellie . Once she knew the truth about him , he felt sure , she would tell the American flyer good-bye . As he approached the makeshift landing strip next to the Monasteryof the Cross , he saw David and the other Haganah pilot ,  |p152Michael  , peering at the engine of the little blue Piper Cub . " I 'm a fighter pilot ! " he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an archaeologist , y'know ? When do we start training pilots , anyway , Michael ? " " As soon as we get the planes . This is it , David . This and twelve others like it . Eliahu bought twenty of these things for scrap , and we pieced these together . " David rattled something in the engine . " Good grief , " he said in disgust . " We ca n't just fly these tin cans over the Arab Legion and drop rocks on their heads . Somebody might get mad and shoot us down . " " Be patient . " Michael clanked against the engine with a wrench . " Patient ? Is n't that somebody in a hospital ? " He nudged Michaelhard , causing him to raise up and bang his head . " Watch it , will you ? " " Did you get it , patient ? " " You think I 'm dumb or something , Meyer ? Holy cow ! " Michael rubbed his hand on his balding head , leaving a streak of grease . David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , I think you 're dumb . Look what you 're doing . We could be eating crab down at Fisherman 's Wharf in Frisco right now . Instead , you 're in Jerusalem tryin ' to hide your bald spot with engine grease from one of the twelve existing planes in the Jewish Air Force . Right ? " " I did n't say these were the only existing planes . I said they were the only ones that can fly . " " Okay . Right . Do n't tell me you 're not dumb , Mike . Dumb Jew . " " Yeah ? Well , you 're here too , you dumb half-Jew . " " Quarter . My grandfather is the one who got me into this , re-member ? " Moshe laughed out loud and thought of the last Abbott and Costello film he had seen at the Arab-owned Rex Theater , the week before it had been blown up by the Irgun Jewish terrorist organization . Then he laughed again at the absurdity of life . " You are right , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We should all go to this Frisco and have crab . " " There , y'see ? He agrees with me , and he does n't even like me . " David glared at Michael , then climbed into the little plane without ceremony . " You coming or not ? " he called to Moshe , who stood wondering how to respond to David 's comment . The truth was that he really did n't like David much , but that was simply because of his involvement with Ellie . More than likely ,  |p153this  zany American was not such a bad fellow . Moshe swallowed his uneasiness and climbed into the cramped passenger seat in the cockpit next to his rival . As the propeller spun to life , Moshe gripped his briefcase with white-knuckled intensity . " Sorry you do n't have a seat belt , pal , " David said with a wry smile . " You 'd better hang on . This little sardine can gets a little bumpy . " Moshe placed his case under his feet and clutched the edge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brow as he noticed how close the end of the runway was to a row of apartmentbuildings . " You fly much ? " David probed as the Piper began to taxi . " Hmm , " Moshe nodded . He had flown only once before , and he had not liked the sensation . " Know how to use a parachute ? " David asked as he kicked the engine to a roar . " No . " Moshe hoped that his terror did not show on his face . " That 's okay . " The little plane rattled over the field , " These buckets only carry one parachute , anyway  --  and it 's mine . " David smiled brightly as the plane lifted off , its wheels barely clearing the tops of the apartment buildings . He took a particular delight in watching Moshe close his eyes and mutter a prayer of deliverance . Moshe opened his eyes and looked down as the plane began a steady southward climb . Below him he could make out the stone buildings of the Monastery of Saint Simeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pleasant mix of middleclassArabs and Jews had lived there in harmony together . Soon , Moshe knew , Katamon would become a battleground between the Mufti 's hired bullies and the Haganah as each struggled for one more foothold in Jerusalem . David began a slow turn to the east , and to his left Moshe could make out the tiny forms of British soldiers at Allenby Barracks . Just beyond , a sliver of road climbed the Hill of Evil Counsel where Judas had received payment for his betrayal of Christ . How ironic , thought Moshe . Some misinformed Englishman with a desire for a good view chose to build the office of the British High Commissioneratop that very hill . In spite of good intentions among those Britishers who had governed Palestine since the collapse of the Turk-Ottoman Empire in 1910 , there had been very little besides Evil Counsel from that hilltop fortress . Moshe felt pity for the man who now held the office of High Commissioner . Sir Allen Cunninghamwas personally sympathetic toward the cause of a Jewish homeland , but his policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his antagonism to the Jews and a desire to see the Partition plan fail before it was even implemented . Nothing would assure that failure quicker than continued armed uprisings by the Arabs . Bevin hoped that Britain then would be asked to step back in , playing a role more to his liking . What words of evil counsel , Moshe wondered , are being passed from London to Sir Allen today ? He would know soon enough , as would the Old Man and the Jewish Agency . Many Jewish sympathizers within the British Mandatory Government were willing to pass along those top secret dispatches for no more than a handshake and a thank-you . The tiny Piper continued to sputter and putt in a slow turn back over the Mount of Olives . Like ants on an anthill , a black-clad caravan wound slowly up the Mount toward the Jewish cemetery  --  yet another scene in the drama being acted out in the streets below . Sniper fire had claimed the lives of six Jews since Partition night . Only six more among the six million who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hundred thousand who lived in the city of Jerusalem . And yet Moshe knew the grief that was borne up that hillside . He remembered the face of his brother Eli , and looked away from the funeral procession toward the rugged walls of the Old City and the golden Dome of the Rock . Such a tiny remnant of Jews lived in the shadow of the Mosque of Omar , yet they were a thorn in the flesh of the Muslims who surrounded them . The Mufti 's holy strugglers , the Jihad Moqhades , had marked the synagogues and Yeshivahschools for destruction first . Somehow they must hold on to those ancient stones . It will be easier , he thought , to hold the modern facilities of the Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital to the north of the city . Although pine-covered Mount Scopus , the hill on which they were built , was deep behind Arab lines and surrounded by Muslim neighborhoods , the structures had the advantage of height . It would be difficult for even an army of irregulars to capture as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haganah 's main problem . Moshe gazed down at the road that led through Arab-held Sheikh Jarrah to the university and the hospital . At the base of the long incline was a curve in the road . The perfect place for an ambush . He made a mental note of it as they passed over the heart of the Jewish section of the New City , then completed their turn to the northwest toward Tel Aviv . Below them lay the artery that would carry the lifeblood of Jerusalem from Tel Aviv . This slender ribbon of highway was Jewishp155Jerusalem 's one link with the sea and the supplies needed to survivethe approaching tidal wave of the Mufti 's fury . Moshe knew how easily that lifeline could be cut . Below them the road descendedfor twenty miles through a narrow gorge called in Arabic Bab El Wad , the Gate of the Valley . Soaring pines and rocks covered the hillsides on either side of the gorge . It was an ideal place to attack any convoys headed for Jerusalem . No doubt the soldiers of Haj Amin knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of one hundred . Finally David spoke , as if reading Moshe 's mind , " Down there 's where you fellas are going to have your problem . There 's not much going to come up that gorge without a fight . I 've been looking it over this week as I 've flown this run . Here , let me show you . " He pushed the stick forward and the plane dropped steeply toward the tops of the trees along either side of the road . Moshe gulped and held tightly to his seat as he stared straight ahead . " Well , stick your head out the window , pal . You ca n't see anything that way ! " David exclaimed . Obediently Moshe shoved the window open and stuck his head out into the wind . Just below him were treetops . Without much effort , he thought , l could gather eggs from the birds ' nests . " Watch this ! " David yelled as they came to a small clearing . There among the rocks was a small group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their shoulders . Their faces were so distinct that Moshe could make out missing teeth in the gaping mouth of one of the men . As David buzzed their little squad , they whipped their rifles into action and began shooting with a menacing pop at Moshe 's head . He jerked it back inside as a bullet punctured the wing , and David swept the plane quickly skyward and out of range . " You idiot ! " Moshe cried angrily . David raised his eyebrows in mock concern . " Gee , are y ' hurt , pal ? " he grinned . " We could have been shot down ! " Moshe slammed the windowshut , noticing a neat round bullet hole through the glass . " Nah , " he sniffed . " These little cans will take a lot of flak . Practically indestructable , according to my friend Michael . He says we 're going to bomb the Arab Legion with ' em . " " I could have been killed ! " " That would have been a real shame , " David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moshe combed his fingers through his hair and resumed his survey of the road through Bab El Wad.  | " Ah , come on , " David said at last . " Do n't take it so hard . Most of these Arabs are lousy shots . Chances are if they aim at you they hit each other . " " Counting on that , were you ? " Moshe glared at David . " Just why did you come to Palestine , Mr. Meyer ? " he asked . " Ellie asked me the same thing last night . Sitting right where you 're sitting . " David grinned again . " And how did you answer her ? I am curious . " " I said I came for her . " " And what did she say to that ? " " She asked me if I would have joined the Egyptian Air Force if she had been in Cairo . I told her maybe . " " I fail to see what it was she ever saw in you . " " Funny thing , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you know , she does n't think much of you , either . She thinks you 've copped out on your own people , you know . " David paused long enough for his words to sink in . " Of course , the professor is wise to us both , I think . He 's got you figured for a Haganah man , and I do n't know what he thinks of me . " " No one quite knows what to make of you , Mr. Meyer . " " I 'm driving this plane , are n't I ? I 've got my reason for being here . And until I get my reason safely home , I 'm going to do what I can to help this two-bit operation . That 's what counts in my book . " " We live by different books , apparently . " " Maybe . Maybe not . You 're worried about a lot of people . I care about one . " " Yourself ? " " Make that two . Me and Ellie . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the lot . " As they swept down from the gorge , David dropped the plane several hundred feet in elevation . Just below them lay the barbedwireencircled blockhouse of a British police station and the red tiled roof of the Trappist monastery of the Seven Agonies of Latrun . How many agonies will our people face , Moshe wondered , before the prejudice and suffering come to an end ? Every foot of this territoryhad once belonged to the ancient nation of Israel . Just beyond them was the Valley of Ayalon , where the sun had stood still for Joshua . Then the road twisted through the Valley of Sorec , where Delilah was born and Samson destroyed the crops of the Philistines by turning loose foxes with burning tails . The ruins of Gezer lay beneath a bald hill just beyond , dowry of the daughter of Pharaoh when she married Solomon . How he loved this land and hoped in the promises ! " We are people of the Book , " Moshe said at last.  | " Millions have been murdered beneath the apathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left , making sure it never happens again  --  that is my concern . " " Yeah , " David said quietly . " I wish you luck . And for as long as I 'm here , I 'll do what I can . But I 've got a future , and I just spent four years fighting a bloody war . And I 'll tell you , pal  --  " David paused and frowned , leaning forward to stare intently at a small black form that crept slowly forward like an ancient beetle along the road . " What is it ? " Moshe asked . " The bus from Tel Aviv ? " " Yeah . Look back about half a mile . There in all those rocks beside the road  --  " Moshe strained his eyes to see what David 's sharp eyes had picked up moments before . Far below them , like a swarm of crawlinginsects , were at least a hundred keffiyah-clad warriors waiting for the bus from Tel Aviv . Just beyond them , hidden from view in the bend of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind the bus , out of sight behind a small hill , an armored vehicle waited to cut off escape . As they watched from their high vantage point , the bus passed an Arab sentry on an outcropping , who then signaled the armored car to pull forward and block the road . " Hold on ! " David cried , pushing the throttle forward . " We 're going down for a better look . " Moshe braced his feet against the floor and gasped as the ground and the Arab band loomed before them until he could clearly see the patterns of the checkered keffiyahs and the startled expressions of terror as the men ran for cover . " Pull up ! " Moshe shouted , certain that they were about to plow nose-first into the earth . " Pull up ! " he shouted again as the stubble of an Arab 's beard became clear and the shrieks of the men louder than the roar of the engine . David 's hands remained firmly forward until the ground loomed only feet from their faces , then with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thumping the head of a scrambling bandit with the landing gear . " Eeeeeeee-haaaaaaaaa ! " David shouted as Moshe scrambled to regain his seat . " Did you see that ? " He climbed steeply , then banked the fragile little craft for a better look at the chaos below them . " That 's the way , darlin ' , " he cried , patting the instrument panel . For a moment Moshe was reminded of Ehud stroking the Ave Maria , and he wondered at the madness of the men in this war . He looked down at the Arabs , who were pointing their rifles at the little blue Piper . Small explosions from their barrels showed thatp158they were indeed firing at the plane as they struggled to pick themselvesup from the dust . Spotting the piper 's hawklike swoop , the bus had halted momentarily , then seeing the armored car move in behind , it had lurched forward toward the band and the roadblock . " They ca n't see the barricade ! " Moshe cried . David circled the plane , barely noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuselage . " We got ta go again , " he said , pushing the throttle forward and plunging into a dive steeper than the last . " Break up that little tea party , " he said through gritted teeth as he struggled to control the tiny plane . Again the ground and the enemy rose to meet them as they plummeted toward the rocks . The rattle of a machine gun burst from the armored vehicle , spraying the air around them and shatteringthe windshield . Dust filled the cockpit as David pulled up at the last possible instant , leaving the ground littered with screaming , cursing Jihad Moqhades , searching for their guns . The bus inched toward the barricade ; as it rounded the corner , the dull thump of two land mines blew out its tires . David climbed out of range of the shower of bullets and quickly surveyed the damage . Wind was streaming into the cockpit and he had a deep gash over his eye . Below them , the bus had crept to a lopsided halt , and the Arabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To David it looked like a scene from a western movie when the hostile Indians circle the wagon train . " Use the wireless , " urged Moshe . " Call Tel Aviv for help . " " Are you kidding ? " said David . " This thing barely has wings , let alone a radio . We 'll have to try and make it to Lydda and hope they can hold out long enough to get somebody out here . " " Dive again ! Chase them away ! " " The plane wo n't take it . We 'll end up in pieces . " David struggledwith the rudder and set course for Lydda Airfield as Moshe slumped in the seat beside him . Once he looked back and glimpsed a tight pillar of black smoke rising from the horizon . They flew the last fifteen miles in silence , Moshe certain that he could have run the distance faster than the crippled little aircraft was flying . He felt sick with the certainty that any help that could reach the bus would reach it too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crowded with British officers and Jewish civilians waiting for word on the fate of the Jerusalem bus . David sipped coffee as Moshe paced and listened to the crackle of the wireless on board the British armored car . When at last the news came , a bearded man beside David crumpled in silent sobs . " No survivors . Thirty-two dead , as near as we can make out . "  |p159Rachel  stared at the slats of the bunk above her . Outside a child threw a ball against the wall of the barracks with a steady thump , thump , thump . She stopped counting after one hundred and eleven . A small group of women , Dachau survivors , sat at the farI end of the room near the stove and lowered their voices as they cast furtive looks in her direction . Words like " traitor " and " whore " drifted down to her , and she wondered why they bothered to lower their voices at all . She knew she was the topic of their conversation . They had survived their ordeals and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before loss of chastity . Rachel had saved her own life , but had sacrificed her soul in the bargain . She sighed and glanced around the bleak interior of the make- ! . shift kibbutz housing . It was clean , certainly  --  a far cry from the displaced persons camps or the filth of the concentration camps . .. But Rachel wondered if she would ever again sleep in a real bed or set her own table for supper . Would she ever comb her hair in front of a mirror that did not reflect the images of a dozen other women jostling in line ? Netanya Kibbutz was clean , and the food was good , but it was not home . For Rachel it could never be home  --  not as long as others spoke in hushed tones about the brand she bore on her arm . They called her a whore and turned their backs on her . Even those Sabras , the native Palestinian Jews , who smiled or spoke kindly to her did so only out of pity , never seeing the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked slowly , her eyes downcast , past the group of whispering women . " Oh , look , " one said just loud enoughp160for her to hear , " the whore is finally out of bed . " The group snickeredand passed the comment from one to another . Numb , Rachel glanced up and smiled sadly at a thin , frail young woman bouncing a baby on her lap . A sneer crossed the woman 's face and she called out to Rachel , " Business is bad since you came to Palestine , eh ? " The group roared with laughter as Rachel turned her head away and hurried outside . But their mockery followed her into the sunlight . Small children ran through the neat rows of quonset-hut barracks , enjoying a game of tag . One small boy fell headlong into her legs as he dodged his pursuer . He hit his chin on the ground with a thud and wailed loudly for his mother . Rachel knelt to help him up . " Are you hurt ? " she asked , brushingthe dirt from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want my mama ! " " There , there . " She touched his curly hair and looked at his chin . " Only a scratch . Just a little scratch . You 'll be all right , " she smiled . From behind her she heard a high-pitched shriek from the door of her barracks . " Samuel ! " Rachel turned to see the thin woman hand her baby to another woman and run toward her and the little boy . The boy saw his mother and wailed even more loudly . " Mama ! She knocked me down . This lady tripped me and knocked me down ! " As a small group of angry women gathered about her , Rachel began defensively , " The boy fell into me as he was playing  --  " " Get away from my son ! " shrieked the mother . " Get your filthy Nazi hands off my son ! " " But I . . . " Rachel tried to speak , but the woman charged at her , knocking her to the ground , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders she scurried back into the building . Rachel wiped the spittle from her cheek and blinked hard to hold back the tears . A dozen other curious camp members looked on silently as she rose from the dirt . Then one by one they turned their backs on her and walked away with their arms about their children 's shoulders ; they must not speak to her or even let her shadow fall upon them . Only one , a thin , timid girl of eighteen or nineteen , dared break the silence . Brushing strands of dark hair out of her face , she stared at Rachel with wide brown eyes and whispered , " In the camp , we all did what we must to survive . " Her glance traveled , unbidden , to the tattoo on Rachel 's forearm . " But never that  --  never that . "  |p161This  place is still a death camp , Rachel thought , and / am one of the living dead . Selling her body to the enemy in exchange for life , she had died to her people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , that her grandfather was still alive and in Jerusalem where she had last heard of him . She was not like the rest of these survivors , she told herself as she raised her chin and returned to her bunk and the tablet of writing paper beneath her pillow . She had family in Jerusalem . She had a family , and the Jewish Agency would help her find her grandfather , a Yeshiva schoolteacher in the Old City . Then she would go home . David had taken off , heading for Netanya Kibbutz , Haifa , and then Jerusalem , barely two hours before , leaving Moshe at the airfield . The bullet-marred hulk they had flown in had been quickly shoved off to a small metal hanger at the edge of Lydda . Then a new plane , identical down to the I.D . numbers , had been pushed out onto the runway for David to complete his run . Ten other identicalplanes , all numbered VAL 572 , were stored in shacks bordering the dirt airstrips near kibbutzim around the country . " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , they 'll think they are seeing double , " Michael had explained . " We do n't want anybody to know we 've got an air force , y'know  --  even if it is just made up of Piper Cubs . " The sun had just touched the rim of the horizon as the SwissAirDC-4 taxied onto the runway at Lydda . Now , that 's the kind of plane we need , thought Moshe as he watched Flight 442 lift off over the orange groves and head slowly toward the sea beyond Tel Aviv . By air , Moshe knew , it was only seven hours from Tel Aviv to Paris , and another fifteen to New York . This time tomorrow , the priority mail pouch he had sent to Zionist headquarters in New York would be in the capable hands of men who could make best use of its contents . Fragments and photographs of the scroll would be shuttled off to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore for dating . And Ellie 's snapshot of the dying tailor of Princess Mary Avenue would be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation . The press would know what to do with it ; he hoped that within the week the world would begin awakening to the fact that the death camps were not the end of the Jewish struggle for survival . " God , " Moshe whispered as the airplane became a tiny speck in the darkening sky , " speak for us. "  |p162Ca|ptain  Luke Thomas tugged at his waxed handlebar mustache , then rubbed his forehead as he studied Ellie 's snapshot of Hassan during the riot . He cleared his throat finally and laid the picture down on Howard 's desk . " Is there nothing more you can tell me about this fellow ? " he asked , glancing around the room at Howard , Ellie and David . " We figured you ought to be able to tell us something . " David 's eyes flashed with impatience . " We have run a thorough check , Mr. Meyer . The man is not and never has been a member of the Palestine Police Force : ' " But the uniform .. " Ellie began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Warne ; ' the kindhearted captain tugged on his mustache again , " a uniform is a guarantee of nothing but a skilled tailor " " Is that so ? " snapped David . " So who are you ? " Howard gave him a sharp look , then said to the captain , " Luke , I called you in on this simply because we are not sure what it is all about . Frankly , before we were confident that the man was not a member of the mandatory government , we did n't want anyone else involved " " I understand , Howard ; ' Luke nodded . " These days it 's hard to know whom to trust . The entire command is split down the middle . Just between us , the Foreign Minister has made a dreadful mess out of the whole thing : ' David interrupted , " So who was this guy , and why was he after Ellie ? I mean , why her ? " Luke leaned back in his chair and pulled out a large dark briar pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Warne ; ' he began , ignoring David 's aggressiveness , " I have shown the man 's photograph to several of the Hadassah Hospital staff . No one remembersseeing him the night the boy was attacked . But Yacov himself says the voice sounded familiar . I have a hunch that the fellow in the ward and the man who followed you are one and the same : ' Luke smiled at her and tamped his tobacco . " There is a con-nection " " But I told you I met the boy only on Partition night:And the kid 's a pickpocket , not a government agent , " Davidinterrupted again . " We are not sure what he is at this point ; ' said Luke . " But at any rate , the children 's ward is under guard : ' He struck a match and drew deeply on the pipe . " Perhaps you , too , should have a guard ? "  | " We are making arrangements for Ellie to leave for the States within the week , Luke , " Howard volunteered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappily and shifted uneasily in her chair . " Until she leaves , perhaps it would not be a bad idea . " " But I  --  " Ellie protested . " Miss Warne , it is no secret how your uncle feels about the establishment of a Jewish homeland here in Palestine . I must confessthat I share his views , and I am not alone among the British officers here . This fellow "  --  he waved his smoking pipe at the photograph of Hassan  --  " we know is not one of us . We do not know , however , what he could possibly gain by following you . Is there anything you have not told us ? Any political involvement during your stay in Palestine ? " Then he glanced up at Howard . " Or perhaps I should ask you , Howard ? If this fellow is an Arab agent  --  and I suspect that is the only answer as to his identity  --  why would he be trailing your niece ? " " I am simply an archaeologist  --  right now , anyway . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , if that ' , s what you are getting at . I am not a member of the Haganah . However , if you ask me again after the mandate ends ... " his voice trailed off , and he smiled broadly . " You and a quarter of the British soldiers stationed here , I 'm afraid , " said Luke . " And another half will join the Arab Legion . " He turned his gaze full on David , who was not smiling . " And how about you , Mr. Meyer ? " David grunted sardonically . " You know good and well I 'm a pilot for the Jewish Agency , " he answered belligerently . " There 's nothing illegal in that . " " No "  --  Luke struck another match  --  " nor in my asking . " Then his face grew serious and he stared intently at David . " You were the fellow who spotted the ambush of the bus yesterday . I read the dispatches . Ghastly ! " " You could say that , " David glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on with Ellie , but until we get her out of here ... " Ellie felt a flash of resentment at David 's mention of her leaving . " I have n't had contact with anyone even remotely connected to the Haganah , Captain Thomas , " she said , " but from what I have seen the last few weeks , I can tell you that if I had half a chance of doing anything to help them , I would not be returning to the States . " " What 's your point ? " David asked Luke . " The point is , " the lean , sun-burned captain answered , " thatp164for some reason , this young woman is dangerously of interest to the anti-Zionist faction in Palestine . I do n't believe they have picked her at random . Certainly there is a motive behind their actions . " " Could it be the scrolls ? " Ellie asked . " Not possible . " Uncle Howard toyed with a pencil thoughtfully . " They would have no concept of their political importance at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Luke probed . " Moshe Sachar . Are you romantically involved ? " Howard yawned and stretched . " A cold trail there , Luke . Moshe is interested in the politics of ancient Assyria . " " Thought I 'd ask , " Luke said , puffing cheerfully on his pipe and casting a quick look in David 's direction . David was staring hard at Ellie , noticing the blush that colored her cheeks at the mention of Moshe 's name . A rush of jealousy filled him and he stood up and walked over to the bookcase , pretending to read book titles as the conversation continued behind him . " Whatever you might think , " Ellie tossed her hair and lifted her chin , " Moshe is the last person in Palestine to be a threat to anyone . Especially the Arabs . As long as he can continue his work , the world can fall down around him . He 'd no doubt leave notes on clay tablets for archaeologists digging around in another couple thousand years . " " And where is Professor Sachar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes fixed on David as though he were trying to see into his mind . " Is n't that right , David ? " David turned and leaned against the bookcase . " I do n't know , " he stated . " I just drive the bus . " David was certain now that it had indeed been Ellie 's association with Moshe that had brought her so near to death . He clenched his fists and turned back toward the bookcase . Ellie 's ignorance of Moshe 's Haganah connection would insure that she got on the plane for home five days from now . In the meantime , he would keep his mouth shut and let Moshe deal with the Arabs when Ellie was safely on her way . " Sachar seems like a real egghead type to me , " he said . " No offense , Professor . All he wanted to talk about was archaeology stuff . When the Arabs attacked the bus , it scared the stuffing out of him , poor guy . " He turned and winked at Ellie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You see , Captain , " she said . " That avenue is a waste of time . "  |p165Perched  on a large rock , Rachel shielded her eyes against the late afternoon sun and searched the skies in the direction of the taint drone of the airplane engine . She shifted her weight and nervouslychewed her nails . Today was mail day again , and as she scanned the horizon for the tiny blue-and-white airplane , her pulse began to race in anticipation that perhaps this was the day that she would hear news of her grandfather in Jerusalem . By now , she hoped , the Jewish Agency must have located him ; by now he knows that f am alive and searching for him . As the small speck in the sky grew larger , so did her excitement , although she attempted to mask it behind a placid exterior . She had learned too late that the others in the camp merely mocked her hopefulness ; most doubted that she did indeed have a family . Two women with whom she shared a small corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from head to foot . Rachel quickly looked at the ground . " Still waiting for your precious letter , Rachel dear ? " one of the women sneered . Rachel did not answer . The other jibed , " No , she 's waiting for the pilot . Maybe he 's a paying customer . " Rachel stood quickly and walked to the kibbutz mess hall , listening as the steady buzz of the engine grew louder . Just as she reached the heavy double doors of the building , the airplane passed low over the grassy square , touching Rachel with its shadow . She whirled around and looked up at its bright blue under-belly , then she stood blinking in the sun as it slowly turned and landed on the kibbutz 's makeshift landing strip . Everyone except the armed guards on duty around the settlement 's perimeters dropped their work and ran to greet the fragile little craft and her pilot . But Rachel turned her back instead and entered the empty mess hall to wait alone for mail call . The sounds of her shoes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee , then pulled out a long wooden bench and sat down . On top of the white table , two lovers had scratched their initials and a heart . Rachel traced the heart wistfully with her finger and wondered what it must be like to love and be loved by a man . Then the doors clanged open and the crowd pushed in behind David Meyer , the tall American pilot . Quickly , as if to hide her thoughts , Rachel placed her coffee cup over the initials . David was laughing loudly , the mailbag slung over his shoulder as he made his way to the center of the room . He dumped the mailp166on the table and sprawled out on a bench . " Hey , how about some coffee for the mailman ! " he shouted playfully . One of the Sabra girls filled a cup and set it down in front of him as two men began to sort through the bundle of letters and call out names of those gathered for mail . Rachel continued to stare at the rim of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger . One by one the names were recited and whoops of delight filled the room as first packages and then letters were handed out . Rachel swallowed hard as the last name was read and hers had not been called . She sipped her cold coffee and listened to the snatches of conversation that floated around the room . " Looks like the Mufti 's going to strangle the Old City first , " she heard David say to the leader of the kibbutz . " Then the Arab Legion will go for the city 's jugular . I do n't know how much longer we 'll be able to get in and out freely . " A wave of panic swept over Rachel . Not to be able to reach Jerusalem would mean she had no reason left to live . There must be some oversight , she thought . Maybe the letter is still in the bottom of the mailbag . Perhaps it has been overlooked . She rose from the table and jammed her shaking hands down into her pockets . She hesitated a moment , then slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other men and two young Sabra women . She stood quietly at his right elbow until the conversation died and the attention turned to her . " Pardon me , " she said haltingly . David turned to her brusquely ; then a smile danced across his lips as he drank in her beauty for the first time . He gave a low whistle and nudged a man beside him . " You guys have been holding out on me , " he laughed . " Where have you been hiding all the gorgeous dames ? What are you doing tonight , honey ? " he joked . The two women at the table exchanged glances and the men looked self-consciously at their hands . David noticed the change of mood . " What 's up ? " he smiled . " Excuse me , please , " Rachel turned to go . " I should not have interrupted . " " Whoa now , pretty lady ! " David jumped to his feet and grabbed her arm . Rachel continued to look down at a crack in the concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess hall had turned towardp167her and the pilot . " Please , " she said quietly , pulling away from him . " I am sorry . " He lowered his voice then and held on to her wrist . " No , I 'm sorry . I mean , I ... I was just kidding , you know ? " " It 's all right , " she answered . " Can I help you with something ? " he asked kindly as he pulled her to a bench . " You want some coffee ? " Still not looking at him directly , she searched for words . " I am waiting , you see . For a letter from the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem . About my family . " David nodded . " It did n't come today ? " Rachel looked into his eyes . " I thought perhaps it might have become lodged in the mail pouch . " " Sure , " David said hopefully , filled with pity at the anguished hopefulness of the girl . " We 'll have another look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She spelled the name slowly as he opened the bags and rummaged inside them . " I 'm sorry , " he said , holding the bags upside down . " That 's it . " - She looked at her hands again and tried to smile . " Yes , " she said stiffly fighting back tears of disappointment . " Thank you very much . " She started to rise but David again touched her arm . " Maybe next time , huh ? " he said , trying a smile to cheer her up . " Maybe . " " Yeah , uh , well , is there anything else I can help you with ? " Rachel clasped her hands tightly in her lap . " Could you ... " she began haltingly . " Would you take a letter to the agency for me by your own hand ? Perhaps if you brought it to someone 's attention . I have family there . In Jerusalem , you see , a grandfather in the Old City , " she explained in a rush . " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I 'll take it . " " It 's in the barracks , " Rachel stood and walked quickly to the door . She turned and gazed gratefully at David before she ran to the barracks and her bunk , pulling yet another sheet of paper from her note pad and stuffing it into an envelope addressed to the Jewish Agency . " Another letter , Rachel ? " one of her barracks companions saidin mock sympathy . " Do n't tell me  --  still no word from Jerusalem ? " Rachel licked the seal and glared back at the woman . Thenshe turned on her heel and dashed back to the mess hall . Sheopened the door and stood self-consciously for a moment watchingp168as the two women at the table filled David in on her peculiar past as an S.S. prostitute . One of the two looked up and saw her at the door , then nudged her companion to silence . They both stared awkwardly at her . David turned , his eyes full of pity as he gazed at the beautiful young woman . Rachel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door . She clutched the letter to her and walked bleakly across the square , feeling totally alone . But she had felt alone before , and still she had lived  --  or at least survived . The sound of footsteps came from behind her . " Hey , Rachel Lubetkin , " came a cheery voice . She did not turn or stop until David caught her by the elbow and spun her around . " Hey , " he smiled into her eyes , " have n't you got a letter for me to deliver ? " Moshe watched in amusement as Ehud finished his third helpingof cheeze blintzes then wiped his mouth on his red flannel shirt sleeve and belched loudly . " It warms my heart , Ehud , " cooed Fanny Goldblatt lovingly , " to feed a man who likes to eat . " She poured another round of coffee for Ehud , Moshe , and Dov Yori , chief of Haganah intelligence , who had gathered in her Tel Aviv apartment . " Someday I am going to marry you , Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . " Only you would eat yourself to death in a week , " Moshe laughed . " She feeds you free now , Ehud . Marry , and you pay the grocery bills , " Dov quipped , ducking as Fanny reached out to whack him on the top of his shiny bald head . Fanny plopped down at the large dark oak table and folded her hands in front of her . " And what makes you think I would have such a gorilla as this ? " She stuck out her lower lip in a mock pout . " King Kong would eat my cooking and not smell half so bad . " " That is why he went to sea , " Moshe added with a grin . " The sardines do n't notice . " " But the refugees do ! " Dov howled . " At least I get them safely to shore , " Ehud mumbled . " Which reminds me , Moshe darling , " Fanny broke in . " Have you heard from Rachel Lubetkin , hmmm ? Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her with surprise , then shrugged and changed the subject . He had not allowed himself to think of the beautiful young woman since he had last seen her . Now , at the mention ofp169her name he felt suddenly embarrassed as though someone might sense the thoughts he had had about her . " So , " he said , " are we going to discuss the delivery , or what ? " " All right , all right , " Dov pushed his chair back from the table . " Let 's get to it . " " This might be my last ride for a while . I will be in Jerusalem . " Moshe sipped his coffee , then added a little sugar , wondering how difficult it would be within a few weeks for the Jews of Jerusalem to find either sugar or coffee . " Then tonight we shall make it a good trip , my little darling and I , " Ehud promised . Dov cleared his throat and pushed on the edge of the table , balancing his chair on its back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bringing in a large group of young males this trip , " explained Dov . " Military age . As soon as they are off the boat , we begin their training . " Moshe nodded in approval . " How many ? " " As many as you can squeeze on board , eh ? " said Dov . " There is one problem we have encountered , " he paused . " Some of our passengers may be plants . " " British ? " growled Ehud , and Moshe imagined his hackles standing up like the ruff of a fierce dog . " Some , " said Dov , a frown creasing the deep lines of his plump face . " American Army intelligence has been able to help us with this a bit . Do n't ask me why or how . But there is one man in particular we need to watch for . They themselves have been searchingfor him for eighteen months . " Dov reached into his pocket and pulled out a faded photograph . He stared hard at it , then tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nazi S.S. Commando , an explosivesexpert until he murdered another officer over a girl in a brothel . His mother was Muslim Arab and his father German . This fella grew up hating Jews . No wonder , with a combination like that , eh ? " Moshe studied the craggy face and the jutting jaw . The iceblueeyes seemed cruel even in the picture . The only evidence of the S.S. officer 's Arab heritage was a large hawkish nose . Moshe had the vaguely unsettling feeling that he had seen the man somewhere before . " So why should we be looking for him ? " " He is a terrorist  --  trained and bred for it . The Americans think he 's responsible for a number of atrocities . They would have liked to have had him as a defendant in the Nuremburg trials . Unfortunately , after he sliced up his fellow officer , the Nazis threw him into Ravensbruk. "  | " Ravensbruk ? " gasped Ehud . " With Jewish prisoners ? " Dov nodded . " Poetic justice , eh ? There he rotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his avowed enemies . " " And now ? " Moshe asked , the feeling of uneasiness growing . " He was traced heading south through Yugoslavia . The Americansbelieve he may try to pass himself off as a Jew to get onto one of our ships and smuggle himself into Palestine . Not that it matters , because he 's sure to take an alias , but , his name is Fredrich Ismael Gerhardt . Tattoo number 346686 . If you see anyone resemblinghim , check the tattoo . " Moshe passed the photograph to Ehud , who studied it closely , then grunted and pitched it back to Moshe . " How do you know he is not already in the country ? " " We do n't . But we are assuming he will make for the heart of Jerusalem and the Mufti 's good graces . He had a friend , an Arab that he attended commando school with . I am certain you must remember him from the ' 36 uprising , Moshe . " Moshe leaned forward and rested his arms on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | Yacov felt tears of joy burn his eyes as Ellie told him about Shaul. " . . . and Miriam scolds him , but I see her sneak scraps of meat to him when she thinks no one is looking . " " Like Grandfather ! " he said with a delighted laugh . " Always he scolds , but then he pats him and scratches his ears . " A wave of homesickness flooded the boy , and all he wanted was to see Grandfatherand Shaul once again . Just to see . " It wo n't be long , you know , and you 'll all be together again . The doctor ought to be here in a while , and you can get the straight story from him . He told Moshe and me that it 's looking good . " A balding , white-coated English doctor with a thin moustache pulled the curtain back and said cheerily , " Quite good , actually . " Yacov turned his head in the direction of the crisp British accent . " They found Shaul , Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Ellie 's house . " " No doubt eating you out of house and home ? " he asked , switching the overhead light off and turning on a dim bedside lamp . " Today we change the bandages and give you a few minutes to look about while we check your progress . " Yacov grimaced at the sharp pain he felt as the doctor gently cut away the bandages covering his eyes . " Relax , my boy , " said the doctor . " Things may be a little fuzzy at first . " Ellie reached over and took his hand . " It 's okay , Yacov . I 'm here . " He squeezed her hand tightly , fearful that when the bandages were finally taken away , he would see only darkness . It was , he thought , God 's punishment for his sin . " I am afraid . "  | " The room will be dark , " intoned the gentle voice of the doctor . " A little later we will lighten your surroundings so you will have a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I am blind , it is God 's punishment , " he said quietly . Ellie drew her breath in sharply . " Do n't say that , Yacov , " she gripped his hand tighter and kissed his fingers . " God did n't do this to you . " She heard herself echo Uncle Howard 's words . " Men did . " " And very evil men at that , " added the doctor as he unwound the bandages . " But I looked at the graven image . I sinned against the law of Moses . " Ellie exchanged concerned looks with the gray-haired physicianas he took away the last of the long bandage , leaving two cotton pads over the boy 's eyes . " What do you mean ? " she asked , feeling the same sense of isolation she had felt when Moshe had prayed with Yacov . " The picture  --  Young Girl Reading . I looked upon it and have broken the law . I have thought through these days that it must be my punishment to be blind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would think that if I were God , Yacov , I would do everything possible to give you sight . I am only a doctor with the heart of a man , and have I not done everything I could to help you ? " Yacov nodded slowly . " It is now most certainly in the hands of God , " said the doctor . " But do not judge His heart until I lift the bandages . " He smiled and winked at Ellie , and she felt grateful for his sensitivity and understanding . She patted Yacov 's hand and remembered the story of Jesus healing the blind man . For the first time since she had been a child , she prayed that the tender heart of God had worked through the hands of the doctor . Gentle hands lifted a corner of the gauze pad . " Do not open your eyes until I say you may . " He switched off the bedside light , leaving the room in a soft gloom as he removed the final layers and dropped them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crust covering the eyelids , Ellie stroked Yacov 's arm and silently prayed . " All right then , young man ; open your eyes . " " But I have sinned in other ways as well , " he said , beginning to panic . " Open them slowly . It may be a bit painful . "  |p173As  if they were too heavy to lift , his eyelids fluttered , then opened a crack . The doctor held a tiny pencil of light above his eyes and moved it slowly to the right and left . " What do you see , Yacov ? " he asked . " Tell me what you see . " " A little light . A small candle moving in the darkness very far away . " Ellie sighed with relief . " Excellent ! " exclaimed the doctor . " Perhaps God has a them with fresh bandages . " Grandfather says He is slow to anger and ever merciful , " Yacovsmiled . " Your grandfather sounds like a wise man . " " He is a rabbi . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor glanced quickly at Ellie . " And has he been to visit you , Yacov ? " " They say the Old City is cut off . I should like very much to talk with him about all that I am learning . " " Soon , perhaps . And do you have family in the New City with whom you could stay if we were to allow you to leave ? " , " No one , " he answered sadly . " Except Shaul . " " Ah , yes , " the doctor nodded . " The dog ? " Ellie caught the doctor 's eye . " We could help make arrangements , Doctor . Do n't make him stay here any longer than is nec-essary . " " I would say by Christmas , anyway . " He squeezed Yacov 's shoulder . " Hanukkah for you , eh ? " " I should like very much to spend Hanukkah with Shaul and Grandfather . " Yacov turned his freshly bandaged head toward Ellie . " Hanukkah is called The Festival of Lights , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights , will it not ? " The broad headlight of the ancient Harley-Davidson cracked the cold darkness before Moshe , illuminating the road back to Jerusalemand Ellie . The motorcycle would have to do ; he would not wait for the Jewish Agency 's sputtering Piper Cub to lift him over the danger that lurked by the roadside  --  not since he had heard about Gerhardt and Hassan . His uneasiness about Gerhardt 's photographhad transformed into the brutal awareness that he knew the terrorist 's face not because he had seen him , but from Ellie 's detailed description of the man who had broken her camera and knocked her to the sidewalk . Gerhardt was not , he had realized ,  |p174on  his way to Palestine ; he was already in the service of the Mufti and walking freely about the streets of Jerusalem . Three times he had tried to reach Jerusalem by phone , only to learn that the phone lines were down . He had sent Ehud and the Ave Maria out alone for the pickup , and borrowed Dov 's motorcycle for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much danger Ellie was in at this point ; he could only guess that Gerhardt and Hassan had followed her because of his relationship with her . Undoubtedly they had sought to locate Haganah bases throughout the city and had marked them as targets . At any rate , no Jew was safe in the Holy City now , not with the likes of Gerhardt working for Haj Amin . That was , after all , the nature of terrorism : strike where least expected , mutilate and murder the innocent until , in the end , terror defeats the morale and determination to stand and fight . Jerusalem , Moshe feared , stood on the brink of another kind of holocaust . The biting wind tore at Moshe 's face and fingers as the heavy cycle roared past the ghostly white stony of the ancient village of Beit Dagon , named after the ancient fishing god of the Philistines . Six miles farther along , an icy rain fell , soaking through his jacket and trousers as he passed Sarafand , Palestine 's largest British militarybase . Just beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile Arab territory . All the kingdoms and governments that have sought to possess this land , he thought where are they now ? As the cold numbed his cheeks , he remembered a saying he had learned from the old rabbis when he was a child skipping through the streets of the Old City : " As dust outlasts iron , Moshe , so Israel shall outlast her oppressors . Someday our Messiah will come , and once again we shall have a nation . Then we shall be truly free . " Moshe could not remember when he had stopped looking for the Messiah . Perhaps it had been the day the British officer had come with the news that his older brother Eli had been killed by the men under command of Ibrahim El Hassan . " There must be another way for Jews to live in freedom , " he had told his griefstrickenmother . " If God will not send the One to bear our burdens , then maybe we must learn to bear them ourselves and make a homeland that is a refuge for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation of Israel had become his dream , his Messiah . It was a dream , he knew , that would be purchased with the blood of many . As he neared Latrun , he passed the burned-out hulkp175of yesterday 's bus from Tel Aviv , the coffin for thirty-two precious lives . Was it only yesterday , he wondered ? Already their blood had been washed from the road by the rain . Only thirty-two more Jews , the world would say  --  what was thirty-two compared to millions ? A sense of despair filled him as he realized that each life lost would soon be washed from the world 's memory . " They do n't know , " he said to their ghosts as he passed , " that each of you had a name . " Ahead lay Bab El Wad and the twisting , contorted agony of mountain gorge that led to Jerusalem . Moshe gripped the handlebarsas the cycle reared back and he began the ascent . By now he was completely soaked to the skin , but still he thanked God for the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven the Arab peasants who guarded the pass into the warmth of their villages . The smell of rain-soaked pines filled his nostrils , and he found it hard to believe that danger lurked so near to him . Five miles outside Jerusalem the friendly lights of Kibbutz KiryatAnavim glistened from the hillside to his left . Just beyond on the right stood the medieval remains of a Crusader castle , and ahead the lights of Jerusalem sparkled a welcome . It was hours past curfew when , at last , Moshe passed the dark , squat building of Egged bus station and then the brightly lit building that housed the Palestine Post , where printers were setting tomorrow'snews . For once , the headlines would be tame when the morningpaper hit the streets . But , Moshe thought , that could n't last long . He turned on Ben Yehuda Street and roared past the Atlantic Hotel , where David Meyer shared a room with Michael Cohen , and where half a dozen other members of the Haganah lived . Moshe wiped the rain from his goggles and looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still burned . When at last he turned onto King George Avenue and passed the Jewish Agency building , he could see that the Old Man 's office was still lit up . He was tempted to stop and share his information with him , but there would be time enough for that in the morning . Right now , all he wanted was to see Ellie 's face smiling up at him , to hear her say she understood why he had not been able to tell her of his secret life . He turned onto Rehavia and idled up the street , his eyes searching the shadowsfor someone who might be watching the Moniger home . The street seemed to be silent and empty . Every window was dark . Moshe turned off the engine and coasted on the heavy machine , balancing with his legs as the cycle rolled to a stop in front of the Moniger home . Moshe lifted off his goggles and hung them from the dripping handlebars ; then he stiffly dismounted and setp176the kickstand . He stood for a long moment staring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door . Suddenly , he felt the hair on the back of his neck prickle as he heard the rapid scuffing of feet rushing toward him from behind . He whirled around to face two unidentifiable black forms . They instantly leaped on him , hurtling him to the wet sidewalk . Moshe swung a hard right , knocking one of his assailants away . The other hit him hard with the butt of a pistol on the side of his face . The world seemed to swim around him , but still Moshe fought , placing a well-aimed kick into the man 's groin . He fell back with a groan and rolled in agony on the sidewalk as his comrade rushed forward again and jumped on Moshe . Moshe felt cold wet steel against his temple and heard the hammer of a pistol lock into place . " One word mate , and you 're a dead man , " said a menacing voice . " Get your ' ands behind your back , and roll over on the side-walk . " Without another word , Moshe complied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked him in the back . Then handcuffs clicked firmly onto his wrists . " Are you okay , Smith ? " the man called to his companion . " Did ' e ' urt you , lad ? " The accent was decidedly English . Smith groaned , climbing to his feet with the aid of the wroughtironstair railing . " Kill ' im ! " " Forget that , lad . Rouse the professor and we 'll call H.Q. with word we 've captured someone lurking about . " The man pressed the gun to Moshe 's temple once again . " Get up , " he growled . Awkwardly , Moshe struggled to his knees , the handcuffs biting into his wrists as Smith limped up the steps and knocked hard on the door . After a moment the porch light came on , revealing that Moshe 's two assailants were , in fact , two miserably wet British soldiers . The door burst open and a disheveled Howard Moniger peered unhappily out the door . " What is it ? " he snapped . " We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some difficulty , owing to the pain he still felt  --  then turned his gaze on Moshe. " ' e gave us quite a fight , you might say , but ' ere ' e is . We got ' im . " Pride filled the voice of the man behind the gun . Howard blinked in disbelief . Then rage clouded his face and he rushed down the steps , pushing the startled young soldier to the side . " Idiots ! " he exploded . " You have just arrested Professor Moshe Sachar of the Hebrew University ! "  |p177Thirty  minutes later , behind the closed door of the study , Moshe nursed a cup of tea as Ellie held an ice bag to his cheek . He was wrapped in Howard 's red plaid robe and looked for all the world like a man with a very bad hangover . " And so you can see , Howard  --  " he looked sorrowfully at Ellie  --  " and Ellie , why I felt I must come back . I know that my words will not pass beyond these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seriousness of your association with me now . Perhapsit is I who have placed you in danger . " " Oh , Moshe , " said Ellie , her voice full . " I am so sorry . All this time I thought you were  --  " " It is I who need your forgiveness , my love , " said Moshe . " Also yours , Howard . " Howard sat in his massive leather chair , his fingers pressed together at his lips . He had listened to Moshe 's story without comment . He drew a deep breath . " I have suspected as much for some time , " he said gently . " There is no need to ask for forgiveness from this quarter , my friend . My heart is fully with you  --  surely you know that . " He picked up a pencil and tapped it on his desktop . " If there is any way that I can be of help , Moshe . Please ... " his voice trailed off as Moshe reached across the desk and took his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We both have Ellie to consider now , of course . Next Wednesdaythe students from the school will be leaving for the States . She is going with them , " explained Howard . " If you are staying Uncle Howard  --  " Ellie interrupted . " Nonsense , " Howard responded gruffly . " I 'm over twenty-one , " she argued . " I can make the same offer , Moshe . If there is anything ... " Moshe put his hand on her cheek . " I had a lot of time to think on the ride from Tel Aviv . I think perhaps your uncle is right . Your skill as a photographer would be of great benefit to publicize our plight . But , Ellie , in case you have not guessed it by now , I love you . You must go home . " Miriam knelt with difficulty among the packing crates that litteredthe floor of the professor 's study . Ellie watched as the old woman carefully wrapped an ancient clay bowl in newspaper , then placed it in the crate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor finds this one ! " she said . " I do not think he will ever have to leave Jerusalem . Even in the riots when my beloved husband is killed , the professor stays andp178makes a place for me here . " She sighed sadly . " He 'll be back , Miriam . And Beirut is not so far away . He asked you to go there until this thing blows over . Why do n't you go with him ? " " I am too old . Too old . And if we all go , as the Mufti would wish of us Christians , who then shall be left in Jerusalem ? Only the Mufti . Miriam will stay here , thank you . My son , he finds me a nice room at the Semiramis Hotel in Katamon . Not so far away . " " Your son will be staying with you ? " Ellie asked , carefully wrappinga clay tablet . " Oh , yes , " she replied brightly . " And my young grandson . But I will tell you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your strange ideas . And shall pray daily for you as you return to your home . " " And I 'll tell you the truth , I wish I were n't going . If I thought for a minute I would be anything but a bother and a worry  --  " " Ah , yes , but now the America government says that those who stay and help will lose their . . . what do you call it ? " she asked . " Citizenship , " Ellie finished in a disgusted tone of voice . " Somebody 's making a bad decision over there , if you ask me . " " Without the help of America I fear gravely for my Jewish friends , " the old woman sighed . " But our Lord , He sees it all , does He not ? " Ellie did not answer , instead continuing the work with renewed vigor . Her bags were packed and standing at her bedroom door , waiting for the flight that would take her home the next morning with the other students and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she thought about leaving Moshe and David , who had decided to stay in spite of the U.S. Embassy 's warning to American citizens . She looked around the room at the half-empty bookshelves and wondered if she would ever be back again . If only there were something I could do , she thought miserably . " Soon the Jews celebrate Hanukkah , the Festival of Lights . This year will be most sad and quiet , I fear , " the old woman shook her head . " And Christmas ! " she threw up her hands . " We must celebratein our hearts Christ 's birth . If others knew Him , I think that then there will be no need of packing and talk of armies and killing . This old woman has seen too much . " Miriam pulled herself up and left the room without another word , leaving Ellie alone with her thoughts . After a few minutes Miriam returned . She held her hands out of sight behind her back ; then as she neared Ellie , she pushed ap179brightly wrapped package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Take it . I buy it especially for you . You are sometimes a very foolish girl but also  --  " her old voice broke  --  " very dear to this old heart . " Flabbergasted , Ellie took the bright red package from Miriam 's gnarled hands . " But it 's not Christmas yet , " she protested . " Just so , " Miriam responded . " Well , then , you have to pack it , and when you are happy in Los Angeles , you will think of us here and pray for the peace of Jerusalem , eh ? " Ellie clutched the package to her , then stood and embraced the old Arab woman who for a lifetime had lived in the hope of peace and the threat of war . " You know , " said Ellie , gazing tearfully into Miriam 's faded brown eyes , " I feel like I 'm running out on something I 'm supposed to do . I feel . . . bad . " " May the Lord hold your life in the palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek , then turned and left to work away her emotion with some task in a distant part of the house . Ellie sat on top of a large sealed crate and cradled her Christma5gift . She was tempted to find Miriam and open the present now so that the old woman could share the joy of having her gift appreciated . But maybe she will be happier thinking of me on Christmas Day , just as I will feel sad thinking about the ones I am leaving here , Ellie thought . She had just returned to her task when she heard a loud , insistentknocking at the front door . Uncle Howard walked quickly past the study and answered the door . Ellie strained her ears to hear but could only hear muffled words of a very short conversation , and the solid closing of the door . Still in his pajamas , robe , and slippers , Uncle Howard padded into the study and plopped down on a crate next to her . His face was grim and serious and he held two envelopes in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure this is nothing serious ... " He sounds serious , thought Ellie with alarm . " What is it ? " she eyed the envelopes suspiciously . Both were telegram envelopes , and telegrams usually brought only grief with their brief messages . " What ? " she asked again . Uncle Howard held them out to her . " They are both for you . One from L.A. and the other from New York . " She took them gingerly from his hands and sat staring at the envelopes as if trying to guess their messages . " They are addressed to me . " " That 's what I said , " Uncle Howard leaned forward impatiently . " So open them , child ! "  |p180Carefully  , Ellie tore the flaps first of one and then the other . She handed the one from Los Angeles to her nervous uncle . " Here , you read that one , " she instructed , pulling out the contents of the envelope from New York . She did n't know anyone in New York , and felt certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a death or some other tragedy . Uncle Howard read aloud the message from Los Angeles as relief flooded his weary face . " ELLIE : DADDY AND I FLYING TO MEET YOU IN NEW YORK STOP WILL CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS IN BIG APPLE STOP PRAY FOR YOUR SAFE RETURN STOP KISSES FOR HOWARD MOM " Shaul lay stretched out in the middle of the parquet floor of the study , reveling in a patch of warm afternoon sunshine . Fifteen minutesearlier , Ellie had sent her parents a wire that would stop their trip to New York . Unshaven and clearly distraught , Uncle Howard followed her into the study . " I am responsible , ultimately , for your safety , Ellie . " He clasped his hands behind his back and paced to and fro in front of the nowemptydisplay cabinets . " If anything ever happened to you , I would never forgive myself . " He stopped before his desk and picked up a rumpled telegram . " Worse than that "  --  he waved it under Ellie 's nose  --  " your mother would never forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad head , then scratched him under the chin , pretending not to hear Uncle Howard'sstern voice . " If I leave now , " she said with an amused , smile , " Life magazine will never forgive me . " She pulled the New York telegram from her trouser pocket and rattled it at him . " You ca n't argue with the power of the press , Uncle Howard . Neither can Mother . " She unfolded the paper and began to read deliberately : .. LIFE EDITORIAL VERY IMPRESSED WITH PALESTINE PHOTOGRAPHS . . . HOPEFUL YOU CAN ACCEPT ASSIGNMENT ... ALL EXPENSES , etcetera , etcetera , etcetera , " Ellie finished triumphantly . " Ellie , if you take that assignment , there 's no telling what you 'll get yourself into . Have n't you had enough ? Have n't you heard enough and seen enough to know that no one is playing games here ? " " You 're right . Nobody 's playing games . Least of all me . You remember what you said to me about everything having some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe this crazy mixed-up messp181I call my life is meant to be lived right here , at this exact moment . Maybe I can be just a tiny part of some kind of miracle . " Excitement rose in her voice . " That 's not what I meant , young lady , " he scowled . " You do n't think God can watch over me , Uncle Howard ? " She lifted her chin defiantly , having sprung a trap he could not maneuverout of . " God is not some kind of bulletproof vest , Ellie . " He frowned down at her . " Take a look at Yacov  --  " " That 's right . What about the boy ? He 'll be getting out of the hospital in a few days . He can never get past the Arab blockades into the Old City . Where 's he going to stay ? " " You 're changing the subject , Ellie Warne . You remind me more of your mother every day . " He sighed with exasperation and plopped down in his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said absently . " But you  --  " " I did n't change the subject . Yacov has no place to go , and I think he ought to stay here with us . " She sat back with finality and glared at his frowning face . He slammed his fist on the desk and leaned forward angrily . " Not with us . You , my dear , will be back in sunny , nonviolent California in time for Christmas . And regardless of my decision to stay here or wait it out in Beirut ... " Ellie raised her eyebrows in defiance . " Take another look at my telegram . Life has offered me all expenses , a room at the King David Hotel . Go ahead and close the school . Pack up your jar handles and move to Beirut . Either I stay here with you and work for them , or I stay at the King David and work for them . It does n't matter . I 'm taking this assignment . " Uncle Howard leaned back in resignation . " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crate me up like a mummy and send me back out of harm 's way , is that it ? " " I had considered it . " He rubbed his hand across his bald head and gazed around the room . " I 'm sending these treasures to Beirut for safekeeping , regardless . They 're worth more than I am , " he mumbled . Then he looked up at Ellie , a light of humor flickering in his eyes once again , " You think God can use the likes of us , child ? " Ellie rolled her eyes as if to comment on the seeming impossibilityof it . " Who knows ? " she laughed . " Well , then , you better call Moshe and find out where we begin . "  |p182David  rubbed his stockinged feet together under the makeshift poker table in his hotel room . Wearily he toyed with his dwindling pile of matchstick chips as Michael Cohen leered from behind a miniature lumberyard of winnings . " Good grief , " drawled cherub-faced Benny Rothberg as he shuffled the dog-eared cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah , " David chimed in , " if he gets any more matchsticks over there , the whole table 's gon na collapse . " " Shut up and deal already ! " snapped Bobby Milkin , a coarsefeaturedNew York born Jew . His large green cigar clouded the room with a thick reeking haze . " Why do n't you put that thing out ? " Benny wrinkled his nose and fanned the air with the deck of cards . " Nah , " snarled Bobby , " I got ta fumigate the place . Get rid of the bugs from that stinkin ' dog . " " He did n't have fleas , " said Michael defensively . " He had a terminal case of mean . " Bobby chewed the cigar . " He just do n't like cigars . " Benny dealt the cards . " Or people that smoke . " Michael nonchalantly picked up his cards one by one . " Or people that smell like Milkin . " David smiled as Bobby blew smoke over in his direction . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . " It 's not the cigar that stinks , fellas ; it 's this hand ! " He pitched his cards to the table . " I 'm out . " Michael 's eyes remained cool as he picked up two matchsticks and tossed them onto the ante . " It 'll cost the rest of you guys two to stay . "  |p183David  scraped his chair back from the table and stood and stretched . He walked slowly to the windowsill and looked out over the rain-soaked stillness of Ben Yehuda Street below . Never , he thought , has the Street of the Jews housed such a motley crew as the American Haganah volunteers . " Has it stopped raining yet , David ? " Michael asked , as he triumphantly laid his full house on top of Bobby 's three nines . " Just a little drizzle , " David answered . Milkin groaned , and the others laughed . " At least it do n't smell like wet dog in here no more , " growled Bobby as he counted his meager ration of matchsticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael agreed . " But it 's a good thing for you , Milkin , that we were n't playing for cash . " Benny straightened the cards carefully before replacing them in their worn-out box . " So what 'd you guys do with the mutt , any-way ? " " David had him made into a fur coat for his girl , " Bobby guffawed . " Nah , he took him over to her house and left him . She said she 'd , keep the dog , but David had to go . Right , Dave ? " Michael added up his winnings . " ' Bout the size of it . " David smiled and plopped down on his bed , which sagged and groaned under his weight . " I better go to bed so you guys can get out of here . " He lay back on his pillow and put his hands under his head . " We can take a hint , " said Benny . He filed out the door after Milkin , who continued to mutter about the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . " See ya in the morning , " Michael called after them , no doubt rousing most of the residents of the Atlantic Hotel . Then he shut the door and rubbed his hands together , gloating . " What a night ! You 'd think Bobby lost his life savings , the way he acted . " " You got X-ray eyes , or were your cards marked ? " asked David dryly . " You 're jealous , Meyer . " Michael kicked off his shoes , then opened the window and inhaled the blast of cold air that flooded the room . " You got ta have heart to play this game right , y'know ? " He slammed the window shut again and threw himself down on his bed . " You call that heart ? You went after Milkin like you wanted to beat the socks off him , " David laughed . " Did n't want his socks or I would 've had ' em . The man is suchp184a schmuck . I 'll take that dog over him any day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David eyed Michael 's toes sticking out of his socks . " You might have heart , but if you had a brain in your head you 'd have played him for his socks . " Michael wiggled his toes . " Scarecrow , right ? Scarecrow and Tin Man , that 's us . " David leaned over and switched off the light . " Michael ? " he asked as he unbuttoned his shirt and threw it into the darkness . " Yeah ? " Michael 's voice sounded sleepy . " If we had brains we 'd be back in Kansas with Aunt Em . " David closed his eyes . " Do n't forget Dorothy and that shaggy mutt Toto over there in Rehavia , " Michael muttered . " I 'm not so dumb that I do n't know why you came to Palestine , y'know . " " Yeah , well , she 's going back to the States . " " You staying on ? " Michael asked after a long pause . " After what I saw on the road yesterday , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " Great , " Michael yawned . " Can I borrow a pair of socks to-morrow ? " Gerhardt leaned against the building across from the Atlantic Hotel and peered up through the pouring rain at the brightly lit windows on the third floor . The red-headed woman 's escape , as it turned out , had been a windfall for him . It had brought yet another young suitor under his ever-watchful eye . The tall American flyer had not come to Palestine simply for his pleasure ; he too , then , was a member of the Haganah , as were those men who stayed with him at the Atlantic Hotel on Ben Yehuda Street . What better place , thought Gerhardt , than this Street of the Jews , to celebrate the Jewish Festival of Lights with a little gift from Haj Amin ? He studied the structure of the building , making mental note of its weakest points . Then he scanned the building on either side and smiled at the simplicity of his plan . The staff of the King David Hotel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complete with medals and epaulets and a hint of gray hair peeking out from beneath the black cap , looked more like a retired general than ap185doorman . As David pulled up to the main entrance in the battered green Plymouth , the doorman stepped forward and effortlesslyopened Ellie 's door and helped her out in one movement . She stood staring up at the leaded arched windows until David joined her on the broad red carpet that led to the plush interior of the hotel . David was angry at the news that Ellie would not be joining the other students and staff of the American school for their flight home tomorrow . " You know this was supposed to be your goodbyedinner , " he said gruffly as he took her arm and passed into the lobby . " Well , ca n't we make it a hello celebration ? " she smiled coyly . " Come on , . David , I thought you 'd be happy for me . After all , this is Life magazine ! " " It 's your life I 'm worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and fro about the walnut-paneledlobby . Aristocratic looking gentlemen reading the LondonTimes sat slouched in deep red leather chairs , while waiters served them Glenlivit whiskey or gin and tonic with twists of Palestine-crownlimes . The carpet , a rich red floral , swirled around the well-polished shoes of British officers and government staff who spent their spare hours relaxing and reliving the latest events . All in all , the establishment bore remarkable similarity to the Savoy Hotel- in London . Brass lamps on tables near the chairs gave the feeling of an English manor house , and in the bar adjacent to the lobby Ellie glimpsed paintings of horses soaring over jumps and galloping across the broad meadows of England . Why , Ellie wondered , if they are so in love with the atmosphere of Great Britain , are they so eager to stay here ? Dressed in a tuxedo , the headwaiter stood at attention near a small desk as they walked into the high ceilinged dining room . White tablecloths and gleaming silver graced the delicate Queen Anne tables , and waiters gracefully moved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of the diners before needs were even realized . Ellie had a strong sensation that she had walked into a Cole Porter comedy where everyone was droll and witty and the world was simple . She tried to forget the military guards stationed outside throughout the grounds . For tonight , she decided , she would pretend that this charade was the real world and that the world outside did not exist . " Sir ? " asked the headwaiter with a heavy British accent . " We have a reservation for two . Meyer . I stopped by this after/noon . Your phones are all messed up . " The headwaiter smiled slightly  --  uneasy , Ellie thought , at the reminder that the real world touched even the King David . " Quite , " he said . " Meyer . Ah , yes , this way . " He took two leather-bound menus from a rack and led the way to a small corner table for two almost hidden behind a potted palm . He pulled Ellie 's chair out for her , then lit a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched the menu without seeing , angrily skimming the pages . Ellie looked over the top of hers and watched him , a tolerant smile on her lips . " Would you rather take me someplace else ? " she asked . " Yeah . How about the Copper Kettle on the corner of Gower and Sunset ? " " My mind is made up . " " Your parents are going to be worried . " He glared at her . " I 'm a big girl . And I can take care of myself . " " Like you did in the riot ? They 'd have been shipping you home in a box if I had n't  --  " " I know that . " Ellie laid her menu down . " But something has happened to me . " " You could say that . " David pretended to read the menu again . " I mean inside . Something is going on in me , " she tried to say calmly . " You 're on overload , that 's what . " " There might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she picked up the menu , she felt a surge of irritation . " Who do you think you are , Joan of Arc ? Saint Ellie ? You 're going to get yourself killed for the noble cause of journalism . Even people who fought their way across Europe are going to get blasted in this thing . Walking down the street can be fatal . If we  --  you and I  --  have any future at all together  --  " " You 're assuming an awful lot , David , " Ellie interrupted , " just like you always did . I told you I 'm not the same . " " How do you think Moshe feels about you if he asked you to stay ? " David 's voice got a little louder . " I think he loves me . " " Not as much as he loves this stinkin ' little piece of real estate , he does n't . " " I 'm a journalist . This is my job . " " Two days ago you were an archaeologist 's flunky on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a journalist ! "  |p187Ellie  noticed a couple casting sidelong glances at David as his voice got progressively louder . " Lower your voice , " Ellie said too loudly . " I 've had it with you , David . If that is all you think of me  --  " " I do n't care if it means you 're going to win a Pulitzer , do you hear me ? " " Yes , and so does everybody else in the room . " " You want to be a journalist , go ahead . But do it without me . I want a woman , okay ? This is it . We 're finished ! " The shadow of a waiter fell over the table . Angrily Ellie and David glared up at him . " Is there anything I can get for you ? " he asked , feeling uncomfortableunder their gaze . " Yes . " Ellie stood up . " A taxi . " Moshe stared blankly out the window to where the sun shone on the glistening surface of the Dome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the soil of the sacred spot where Abraham had offered his son on the altar he had built with his own hands . A tall , lanky boy of fifteen , Moshe had donned the stolen uniform of a British soldier and had walked past the Muslim guards at the gates of the mosque . No Jew could openly visit the site without fear of reprisal or arrest . Sweat had formed on his brow and his heart had beat faster as he strode into the courtyard . He had imagined how Abraham had felt , knowing that he had come to this place to offer his son as a sacrifice . His mouth tasted of iron and the pit of his stomach churned . And yet God had been faithful , Moshe remembered . God had provided a ram for the sacrifice , so Isaac had not died . Moshe had raised his eyes toward the Western Wall , which stood as the last remaining edifice of the Great Temple which had been destroyed along with the nation of Israel nearly two thousand years before . Moshe had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of Jews who prayed just on the other side of the wall . They , too , prayed for a Savior who would one day deliver Jerusalem . Only a thin wall of hand-hewn stones separated those Jews from the Muslims he had walked with in the courtyard . But it was a line that marked the hardness of men 's hearts , he had thought . ' Moshe turned from the window and sat down heavily at his desk . He toyed with the photographs of the scroll : the book of Isaiah as it was written when the Great Temple stood where the Muslim shrine now glistened . Not one word had been changed . The promisesremained the same . The destruction of Israel and the wander/ings of her people had all been foretold . Now her people were returning . But what of the Messiah ? He had long since turned his back on the belief of the Holy One of Israel . And yet , the Orthodox Jews who prayed at the wall still denied that there could be a nation again unless the Messiah came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different beliefs among the Jews of the world . Surely there must be one truth in it all . Had the Messiah come to Israel once already , as Howard believed ? Had God provided the Holy One as a lamb of sacrifice to redeem and restore in a different way than the way they had always expected ? The small brass lamp on Moshe 's cluttered desk illuminated the glossy photographs of the Isaiah scroll . Moshe reread the confirmationfrom Johns Hopkins University : " Congratulations . You may well have uncovered the most significantfind in recent history . The material confirms the scroll to be of first-century origin ... " For what seemed like the hundredth time , Moshe leafed through the photographs , amazed at the clear , precise lettering of the ancient writings . He opened his most recent edition of the Hebrew text of Isaiah and scanned the pages for any variation of wording between the scroll and the modern printed page . Letter by letter thewords read the same ; the message was the same . Moshe flipped to Isaiah 53 and frowned as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our transgressions , He was crushed for our iniquities ; The chastening for our well being fell upon him , And by his scourging we are healed . All of us like sheep have gone astray , Each of us has turned to his own way ; But the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on him .. . Moshe 's eyes fell on the modern rabbinical commentaries belowthe text : " The Prophet refers to the nation of Israel ... " Although the text has remained unchanged over two thousand years , the interpretation of the scripture had , indeed , changed . He leaned back and scratched his head , trying to remember the ancient commentaries he had come across on this passage so many years before . He stood and searched his bookshelves for the Aramaic translation written in the second century by Rabbi Jonathan ben Uzziel , a disciple of the great Hillel . " Targum Jonathan on Isaiah 53 , " he muttered , pulling the dusty volume from the shelf . He opened the book to the fifty-secondp189chapter and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosper ... " He frowned at the word Messiah : then he laid the book down and with a feeling of urgency searched for a ninth-century prayer book on the topmost shelf . He carefully removed the crumbling book and leafed through its pages until he found the paraphrase of the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah written for recitation on Yom Kippur : " Messiah , . . . Our iniquities and the yoke of our transgressions he did bear , for he was wounded for transgression : He carries our sins upon his shoulders , that we may find forgiveness for our iniquities ... " " And so , " he said aloud . " The interpretation was changed , although the words have remained the same . The ancients knew the prophet spoke of the Messiah . How inconvenient truth can be at times ! " He half smiled , staring down at the photographs washed in light , " Especially when for so long the one you thought to be your enemy is , in fact , your Savior . This is truth , Moshe Sachar , " he said aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Messiah ? The one they call Christ ? "  |p190The  Old Man flipped through the pages of the December 15th issue of Life magazine , pausing at an advertisement showing Santa Claus puffing away on a Chesterfield cigarette . " Hmmm , " he said , turning the page , then peering at Ellie from beneath his bushy white eyebrows , " Your photograph sells the magazine , and Santa sells cigarettes . Not exactly full of Christmas cheer , your photograph , eh ? " He folded the cover back and lay the magazine face up . Ellie gazed at the shot of the tailor grasping his heart as the murderer 's knife plunged deep into his back . " No , sir . It was like a nightmare , " she said softly . " Moshe tells me how you saved the boy . " Moshe cleared his throat and shifted his weight from one foot to the other . " You have a commission now from the publication to stay in Jerusalem and cover the story ? " " Yes , " she nodded , still staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is good . Very good . Perhaps you can help the world see what we are up against here . That is very important , Miss Warne . We are alone and outnumbered , we Jews . We have been around quite a while , and I hope that when the dust clears we shall still be here . But we will not do it without public opinion . " Ellie looked into his eyes . " I was right in the middle of that , you know . I saw what was going on . I still ca n't figure out why it happened , but it happened . So what do you want from me ? " Ben-Gurion looked first at Moshe , then back to Ellie . He frowned and pursed his lips thoughtfully . " If it is pictures you want , we can make sure you are right in the thick of it . Moshe says youp191are made of pretty tough material . " " He says that , does he ? " She looked at Moshe , who shrugged and grinned self-consciously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , if that 's what you mean . " She sat back in her chair . " Good . If you can take it , we will have all the story you can use . " " I know you 're worried that Life is n't sending some big tough war correspondent to Jerusalem for this . I know I 'm a woman and  --  " " On the contrary . The agency has no qualms about your ability , or the ability of any dedicated woman . I would ask a man the same questions . Where you 'll be going , the other side will be shooting real bullets in your direction . You have to understand . " " You think after what happened to me two weeks ago I am not aware of the danger ? Jerusalem is a keg of dynamite with the fuse lit . And I 'm lucky enough to have plenty of film and an assignment to be here when it blows . " " Lucky ? " The Old Man repeated . " That 's the word . " She held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tapped the photograph of the tailor 's murder . " Luck is not a word many residents of JeruSalem are using right now . " He sat silently . " Then it 's settled . " Moshe rubbed his hands together . " You are staying ! " " You 'd have a terrible time getting rid of me , Moshe , " she said . " Perhaps we should begin with the Ave Maria ? " The Old Man asked Moshe . Moshe grinned and nodded , then turned to Ellie . " How would you like to take a little Mediterranean cruise ? " " Romantic ? " " And dangerous . " Fumbling with excitement , Ellie stuffed a heavy cable knit sweater and a pair of Levis into the blue canvas duffle bag on her bed : As an afterthought she tossed in an extra pair of wool socks and two changes of underwear . Moshe said we would only be gone overnight , but , Ellie thought , it never hurts to be prepared . Her bedroom door squeaked on its hinges and Miriam entered carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where you are going or why , but you will need to eat , eh ? Chicken sandwiches and zucchini bread . The bread is frozen but will thaw soon . Also two oranges . " She tossed the sack onto the bed and stood with herp192hands on her hips , shaking her head in disapproval . " You are wearingthis ? " She squinted at the Levis and denim shirt , then shook her head again . " This is not a picnic , Miriam . I could get dirty . " " What is this ? " The old woman picked up Ellie 's stocking cap and held it between her thumb and forefinger as though it were something contaminated . " You will wear this ? " " Probably . " Ellie continued to pack , wishing Miriam would go away . " Ah ! " she pitched the cap into the duffle bag . " You will look like a sailor . " " I guess so , " Ellie avoided answering the question in Miriam 's voice . " So , you will not tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't . " Ellie put her arm around Miriam 's shoulders and gave her a quick hug . " Well , then , our Lord knows and may He be merciful and keep you safe . " She sighed and turned to leave . " And take a warm sweater . " " I will . " " And if you are going to sea , take extra woolen socks . " " I did . " The old woman smiled broadly . " And stay dry , " she said finally , chuckling as she left the room . Ellie rolled her eyes in exasperation and tied the duffle bag , then followed Miriam and called after her , " Take the day off . Go visit your son . " Miriam raised her hand in acknowledgment and disappeared into the kitchen . There is no use in the old woman staying home and worrying , thought Ellie as she grabbed her camerabag and skipped into the study to kiss Uncle Howard good-bye . He sat among the empty shelves and cases , scribbling notes as he studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up , his eyes were rimmed with weariness . " Leaving , child ? " He put his hand out to her . " On a convoy to Tel Aviv . They say Arabs do n't bother convoys leaving the city . " " Only coming in . When will you return ? " " Tomorrow night . David will fly me back . It 's all arranged . " She stood over the desk and stared at the photographs . " I 'm sorry the Bedouins did n't come back with the scrolls . " Uncle Howard leaned back in the chair and stretched , " To be expected . It is , after all , dangerous for them as well . Perhaps when it is all settled here , quiet again . "  | " When will that be ? " Howard shrugged and smiled . " God knows . " " I 'm glad somebody does . " She leaned down and kissed him lightly on the forehead . Ellie sat across from Moshe on a small metal jumpseat inside the heavily armored transport . The morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They shared the car with four others , two men and two women on their way to Tel Aviv and destinations unspoken but somehow understood . Ellie recognized one , a man with thick glasses in a rumpled business suit carrying a bulging briefcase . He and the slim , muscular Sabra man in khaki had been in the waiting room at the Jewish Agency building . She could only guess at their assignments . The two women looked equally intent . One was thin , almost frail . Probably not yet twenty , Ellie thought . How much like a high school girl she looks ! The other was heavyset and thick-featured . Her kindly brown eyes smiled from behind a very large nose . Her graying hair was pulled back in a bun and she wore a plain blue wool dress and black low-heeled shoes that looked like they had walked many a purposeful mile . She smiled and nodded at Moshe and called him by his first name , but  --  as if by some unwritten law  --  no one asked the others the reason for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather seems to have turned for the better , " said the heavyset woman , turning her eyes toward the streaming light as the vehicle lurched into motion . " It is warming up , " said the bespectacled man , clutching his briefcase to him . " This morning my long underwear did n't need defrosting . " " Much better for the roads , eh ? " said the Sabra man . " We are less likely to get bogged down if it 's not raining . " " Hmmm , " agreed the first . " Less mud for politicians to sling , " he said with an impish grin . The descent from Jerusalem to Bab El Wad was much slower and more uncomfortable than Ellie had remembered it . Rocks and ruts seemed to jostle the travelers every few feet , and the monotonousdrone of the engine soon was the only sound in the armored vehicle . Twenty minutes down the road , the Sabra began to hum a sad-sounding melody and soon Moshe joined in softly until everyone was singing but Ellie , who could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of the travelers with joy as they clapped and stamped their feet in time . " That is beautiful , " Ellie said when at last the song ended . Shep194reached out and took Moshe 's hand . " What does it mean , Moshe ? " " It is called B Shuv Adonoy , " he answered quietly . Then he frowned thoughtfully and began to translate : " When the Lord brought back those that returned to Zion , We were like them that dream . Then was our mouth filled with laughter , And our tongue with singing ; " Then they said among the nations ; The Lord hath done great things with these , The Lord hath done great things with us . " Turn our captivity , 0 Lord , As streams in the thy land . They that sow in tears shall reap in joy . " " Will you teach me ? " she asked brightly . " Oh , there are many songs to learn , " the Sabra chimed in ; then he burst into song and the others joined him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After each song Moshe would translate and then the group would sing it again more slowly so that she could sing along . Occasionally the small convoy would pass an Arab riding a donkey as his wife walked along behind . And once , when Ellie raised up to peek out the slit window , she glimpsed three silent Arab peasants standing on top of a boulder by the roadside , their battered rifles plainly in view . " They will not attack trucks coming out of the city , " Ellie said to herself . " They are waiting for the convoy into Jerusalem . " Somehow the thought was not reassuring . Moshe tugged on her sweater . " Sit down . Sometimes there are snipers in the rocks . They can see movement through the win-dows . " Instantly , Ellie planted herself on the seat and remained there until at last the road seemed to level out and the curves became less difficult . " A few minutes to Latrun now , " the driver called back over his shoulder . " Latrun ? " Ellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place where the bus ... " Moshe nodded and closed his eyes for a moment at the memory . Then the vehicle slowed as the driver downshifted and leaned forward to peer intently out the slit . " Roadblock ahead , " he said apprehensively . " British . " The frail woman shifted uneasily and fear crossed her face . The older woman reached out and touched her arm reassuringly , thenp195pulled herself up very straight . The vehicle ground to a halt and Ellie heard the accents of British soldiers shouting orders , then a loud banging on the doors at the back . " Open up ! " a harsh voice demanded . " Bus fare , " quipped the little man . " Exact change or death . " He sliced his finger across his neck , but no one laughed . " By whose authority ? " shouted the Sabra man . " By the authority of His Majesty 's Mandatory Government of Palestine . " The soldier pounded on the doors again . " Open up . " The Sabra unlocked the doors and shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Three other soldiers stepped forward with guns in hand . " It is our information that this convoy is carrying armed memberscif the Haganah as guards . Step out please . Everybody step out . " " I must protest ! " snapped Moshe . " Arab territory is hardly the place for unarmed Jewish civilians to climb out of an armored transport . " " Maybe not , mate , " growled a portly sergeant , " but them 's our orders . Ladies first . " He extended his hand and helped the heavyset woman out first , then the thin , frightened-looking girl . " You too , " he pointed at Ellie who stood and inched her way through the tangle of legs to the back of the vehicle . She jumped down , feeling unwilling to accept the help of this intruder . He eyed her with interest , taking in her casual dress and heavy field boots . " Goin ' campin ' , are y ' miss ? " he sneered . " We 'll start with you then . Get your ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placed her hands on the side of the vehicle . She closed her eyes and gritted her teeth as the leering soldier frisked her . A wave of disgust and humiliation passed over her as the man ran his hands over her much too slowly for the purpose . " That 's enough ! " she demanded , whirling around and looking straight into his smirking face . " Got any luggage ? " he asked . " ' and ' er bags out ' ere , mates , " he called as Ellie 's camera bag and duffle were passed out to the waiting soldiers . The sergeant pawed through her clothes , then unzipped her camera bag . " A tourist are you , miss ? ' ardly the place to take pictures . " " I 'm a journalist . Life magazine . You 've heard of it ? " He blanched and zipped her bag back and handed it to her . " American , I take it ? Just following orders . Weapons check . " He seemed eager to explain . " We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more'n the Arabs , now can we ? Carries ap196death sentence , y'know , carryin ' a weapon . " He sniffed and grinned obnoxiously . " You can get in now , miss . " " No , thanks , " Ellie 's eyes narrowed with controlled anger as she remembered the Arabs and their rifles back up the road just twenty minutes . " I think I 'll watch . " The old woman was quickly frisked , and did not utter a word of protest . The thin woman grew paler by the minute and hesitantly complied with the order . Ellie thought she detected tears welling up behind the thin woman 's thick glasses as she turned and placed her hands on the truck . The sergeant quickly ran his hands over her , then shouted , " Ah , ha ! " as he touched her just above the knee . " Let 's ' ave it , darlin ' , " he said triumphantly , extending his hand . The woman raised her skirt and pulled a loaded revolver from a leather strap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't expect us to travel these roads without protection , do you ? Not after what has been happening ? " " I do n't expect anything ! " he snarled . " I 'm just doin ' a job . " He handed the gun to a cocky private and led her by the arm to a waiting car . Ellie pulled out her camera and began snapping pictures as the men filed out of the transport one by one to be searched . " I would n't do that ! " the sergeant snarled at her . " And who 's going to say I ca n't ? " Ellie focused on the thin girl in the British car and snapped the shutter . The sergeant backed off and chewed his lip , then rubbed his hand over his cheek nervously . " I told you I 'm just doin ' as ordered . " Then he looked the group of travelers over . " You can get back in now . And that goes for you , too , " he said to Ellie . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where are you taking the girl ? " " Latrun . Headquarters , " he answered curtly . " Now get in . " " No , " said the heavy woman . " I shall go with her to your headquarters . That is in Arab territory . We shall see what your superiors have to say about this . " Then she turned solemnly to Ellie . " Would you like to photograph our arrest ? " She smiled and climbed into the British car as Ellie snapped several more pictures . " Suit yourself . " The sergeant slammed the door . " If you 're with her and she had an illegal weapon , then I ought to arrest the whole lot of you . " Ellie snapped his picture , then smiled a bit too brightly at his irritated expression before she waved at the woman and the thin girl and climbed back into the transport . The doors clanged shut behind her as she took her seat , still furious over the search . Eachp197of the men patted her back as she passed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women ? " she asked in dismay . " Do n't worry , " Moshe smiled knowingly . " They 'll make it to Tel Aviv . " " How do you know that ? They 're being taken to Latrun . " " Did n't you recognize the lady who went with the girl ? " " No . " " You just shot a roll of film covering the arrest of Golda Meir , Ben-Gurion 's right-hand man at the Jewish Agency . That ought to make a cover story , " he laughed . " I 'd hate to see what they do to the sergeant when she pulls out her papers . " " What about the girl with the gun ? " The transport lurched forward . " Golda will not leave her alone . And the British are usually pretty proper when it comes to women . That 's why there are women guards on our convoys . A Jewish man caught with a weapon even for defense would be hanged . " Ellie nodded , still enraged at the unfairness of the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hardly able to believe that such a high-ranking member of the Jewish Agency would put her life on the line so readily . " She seems so  --  " " Like a nice Jewish grandmother ? " " Uh-huh . " " And so she is . Jewish grandmothers like her have helped our people survive two thousand years , " he grinned . " I can see why . " Ellie shook her head in amazement . The occupants of the transport began to sing once again as they passed through Latrun and Sarafand . It seemed to Ellie that they bellowed even louder as they drove along the outskirts of the British military base . The tune they sang was called Hatikvah , " The Hope , " and though Ellie could not understand the words , she felt them in the voices of her companions . There was one hope they all lived for  --  a homeland . When at last they arrived at the Tel Aviv bus terminal , Ellie had learned most of the words of Hatikvah and was harmonizing with her clear alto voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sabra to sing the melody in tenor . " Just like singing in the shower , " Ellie laughed . " Sounds ter-rific . " " Maybe we should sing on Broadway in South Pacific , eh ? " grinned the little man with an accent decidedly that of a New Yorker.  | " Maybe you should just make your homeland in the South Pacificsomewhere . It would sure be easier than this . " Ellie gathered her belongings as the Sabra opened the doors and the interior flooded with light . " I always thought Tahiti would have been a nice place for a Yeshiva school . " Moshe jumped out and extended a hand to help her down . " As long as it was for Hassidim , " the little man followed . " So when the Yeshiva boys saw the girls in grass skirts they could say , Ha see dem ! ' " Everyone groaned and the Sabra tapped his finger to his temple and shook his head . " You are a meshuggener , Arazi . A crazy man , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " Moshe whispered loudly into Ellie 's ear , " An old joke . " " After four thousand years , how many new Jewish jokes can there be ? " The little man guffawed and punched Moshe on the arm ; then he extended his hand , " Good luck to you both . Mazel Tov . " Then he winked at Ellie . " I 'll buy a copy of your magazine . " He turned and followed the Sabra across the lobby of the bus station . Ellie watched their retreating forms , then gazed up at Moshe . " Crazy people in this thing , " she shook her head . " It helps to be something of a lunatic . It could get depressing otherwise . " He put his arm around her shoulder . " And now you will meet the biggest meshuggener in Palestine . " He led her out onto the street and scanned the bustling , frantic traffic until he spotted a battered , rattling black hulk of an automobile weaving wildly through the other cars . It screeched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window on the driver 's side , shouting curses at another car that passed and turned the corner . " Maniac ! " he yelled , shaking his hairy fist . He stuck out his lower lip and seemed to growl , then , still glaring at the last spot he had seen the car , he stomped toward Moshe and Ellie muttering , " Must have worked for the Fiihrer . " " This , " Moshe said sheepishly , " will be your host , Ehud Schiff . " Ehud saw Ellie standing next to Moshe and instantly his demeanorchanged . " Ahhhhh ! " His eyes lit up and he took her hand and bent to kiss it . " You are the Miss Ellie Warne we have heard so much of . Ah , yes , Moshe , she is beautiful . Beautiful indeed , as you have often said . " Laughing , Ellie shook his meaty hand and said , " Well , Moshe has not even told me about you . Until now , that is . " Then she looked wonderingly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am afraid so , " he said with mock seriousness.  | " Ah , that , " Ehud gestured toward the now-vanished enemy automobile . " That car you saw ? Refused to move when I wanted to change lanes , " he explained . " Ehud thinks the highways are like the seas . " Moshe took Ellie 's bags and threw them through the window of Ehud 's car . " That is why the doors of his automobile will not open . They are crushed shut . I shall drive , Ehud . This lady is much too important for me to lose her on the streets of Tel Aviv . " Ehud pouted for a brief instant , then tugged his beard thoughtfullyand climbed into the car through the window . " As you wish , Moshe . So get in already ; my darling waits for us at the waterfront . " Ellie climbed in awkwardly after him and sat wedged between his massive frame and the door of the car as Moshe pulled into traffic . " Are you all set ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my darling Maria , my love ; she is not feeling well . " " What seems to be the matter ? " Concern was etched on Moshe 's face . " She is simply at that age , you know . I fear I shall have to someday get rid of her . " Ellie tried not to register shock . She leaned forward to see Moshe 's expression as Ehud spoke about his beloved and her potentialdemise . To her dismay , Moshe did not seem to think that there was anything unusual about Ehud 's conversation . " Has anyonechecked her ? " she asked , trying to be helpful . " To be sure , " Ehud nodded solemnly . " But he was such a greasy fellow . Lacked the sensitivity a lady requires , so I myself have taken care of her . An occasional kick in the right place when she becomes contrary  --  " " Do n't you think you should call someone more qualified ? " Ellie asked as they rounded a corner and pulled onto the dock . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ehud exclaimed . " Sweet Maria would have no one but me . Who could know her half so well ? " " But you ca n't just get rid of her ! " Ellie protested . " Not after twenty-five years . " Moshe began to chuckle as he set the brake and climbed out onto the wood-planked dock . " Ah , there you see her . Is she not a vision ? " Ehud pointed out the window of the car as he waited for Ellie to climb out . Ellie searched the waterfront and saw no one but two old fishermenscraping barnacles off a dry-docked hulk , and another youngp200man mending nets on the deck of an old trawler . " Where ? " Moshe poked his head in the passenger window . " Do you need help getting out ? " he asked Ellie . She rolled her eyes and made a face as if to ask which asylum Ehud had escaped from . " Where is Maria ? " she asked . " I do n't see anybody female out there , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I suppose it depends on one 's perspective . " He pointed to the ancient , weather-scarred trawler moored in a row with several others . " That , " he said , " is Ehud 's beloved . " Ellie squinted and puckered her face as she read the barely visible red letters on the chipping white paint , Ave Maria . Relief flooded her voice and she rubbed her forehead as a flush of embarrassmentcrept to her cheeks . " I thought ... " she whispered hoarsely . Moshe laughed and offered Ellie his hand . " An easy mistake to make . " Ehud joined them and gazed dreamily at the little ship . " She was so beautiful in her younger days  --  my little darling . " Then he hastened to add , " But surely not half so beautiful as you , sweet lady . " " Watch out , my friend , " Moshe warned . " Maria will be jealous . " Ehud put a thick finger to his lips , " Quite so , quite so . She is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellie leaned close to Moshe , tugging on his shirtfront until he leaned his ear down to her lips . " Is he serious ? " she asked with alarm at the thought of going with him . " Quite so , quite so , " Moshe repeated mischievously . " I told you , meshuggener , eh ? But there is none in these waters with half so big a heart . Come along . " He walked after Ehud toward the deck of the trawler . " We have a long way to go before nightfall . " Sea gulls circled overhead in the clear blue sky , and only a faint breeze ruffled Ellie 's hair as she stood on deck , waiting for the ship to get under way . Tiny waves lapped the sides of the Ave Maria , and sunlight on the water reflected against her hull . Cables and nets cluttered the deck , and as Ellie looked down the row of moored fishing vessels , she found little about the Ave Maria that distinguishedher from the other ships at port . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was no way of telling that she was not an ordinary boat . " God has been with us , surely . " He patted the wheel.  | " She carries the children of Abraham well for her age , " Moshe had said . " Like Sarah ? Maybe you ought to call your next boat Sarah . She was ninety when she had her first child . " Ehud 's face clouded , and he stroked Maria 's wheel . " You shall wound her if you speak so . Pay no mind , my love , " he had muttered . " Why do n't you go on deck until we are under way ? " Ellie left the wheelhouse amused  --  until the engine refused to turn over and only moaned in response to Ehud 's coaxing . " Now see , " he shouted down to her from the wheelhouse , " you have hurt her feelings ! " Ehud cursed and clanked down below deck in the engine room , until at last the stubborn engine sighed and turned over with a roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Moshe cast off the lines and the old hulk shuddered in reverse into the harbor , then lunged forward out past the seawall into the serene blue of the Mediterranean . Gulls cried and followed after them in hopes that they would find fish to catch and share . Ehud occasionally glowered down at her , and Ellie felt intimidated enough that she stayed on deck until at last Moshe joined her with two mugs of coffee in his hands . " I said the wrong thing , " Ellie smiled . " He does n't like me , I 'm afraid . " " He 'll get over it , " Moshe handed her a mug . " Drink this . " " He 's a little strange , is n't he ? I mean , the boat and everything . " " This boat is everything . He lost his own family in the camps  --  sisters , brothers , and a young wife early on in the war . He 's a good man . He has defied the blockade a hundred times . Sixty-seven thousandJews have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mandate . The Ave Maria has been stopped and searched a dozen times , but never with passengers on board . Ehud is right . There is something special about the old girl . " " What happens to the ones who are caught ? " " They are still behind barbed wire , on the Island of Cyprus . The British keep them there so as not to arouse the wrath of the Mufti . " Ellie inhaled the steam of her coffee , then sipped the warm brew . " Looks to me like the Mufti is plenty mad already . " She gazed steadily at Moshe . " What would happen to you if you were caught ? " " Up to now we have only smuggled human contraband . We would be tried and imprisoned . Smuggling weapons means exe-cution . " " They would kill you for that ? Weapons for defense ? " " Many of us have died already . " Moshe tasted his coffee.  |p202Ellie  thought about all ' the things she had accused him of ; then she took his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tel Aviv began to shrink and disappear . " I said a lot of things to you that were wrong . I did n't know you had put everything on the line for this. , , " How could you have known ? " he lifted her chin . " I would have been a fool had I let anyone know . " " " I 'm ... I do n't want to be just anyone to you , Moshe . Would you forgive me for the things I said ? " " Even as you said them you were forgiven , my little shiksa . " He kissed her on the cheek . " But in many ways you are still a child  --  impatient with those who do not see the world your way , at the same moment your eyes have only just been opened . " Ellie lowered her eyes and stared at the coil of rope just in front of where they sat . " You think I am insensitive ? " " On the contrary . I believe you feel "  --  he waved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is more to truth than simply feeling . Just as there is more to love than feeling . Do you understand ? " " I 'm trying , " she said , feeling hopeless and lost in his words . " Finding the truth involves commitment to search , to be open and work at uncovering the facts . " " You sound like an archaeologist . " Moshe laughed . " I suppose . It is your uncle , after all , who first challenged me to search . " He looked away and tried to find words to begin again . " There are so many things I do not understand , and yet I believe that just beyond my understanding lies an answer . God says that we will be a nation once again . I do not understand how we have survived the oppression of two thousand years of Christian and Muslim hatred , and yet stand on the brink of statehood . Therefore , what God said through the prophets must be truth . Perhaps . my duty is to find the promises , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does this make sense ? " " Is n't it funny ? " Ellie gulped her coffee . " I 've spent my whole life thinking that what I feel is the way things must be . You 've spent your whole life thinking about facts and truth . There has * be a place for both of those things : knowing truth in your head and feeling it in your heart . I 'm trying , Moshe , really I am . " He squeezed her hand . " And so am I. And Ehud and Howard and your flyer friend David  --  " Ellie stiffened . " David ? He ca n't see past the nose on his face . " Moshe kissed her on the nose , then winked , " A common failingp203in human nature , is it not ? " he laughed . " Judgment of another without the facts . " " I sure had you figured all wrong , did n't I ? " She smiled up athim . " I 'm glad . " " Since you have finally figured that out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will tell you that I think David seems to be a fine fellow . ' He was very brave in his little plane . " ' " He 's a show-off , that 's all . " She put her arms around his waist . " This may not be the moment to convince you otherwise . " He drew her close to him and kissed her gently . " And what verdict have you reached about me , your honor ? " " Can you cook ? " " Where is the kitchen ? " " You see , you really are perfect . " ' Ellie followed Moshe down the narrow steps into the hold of the ship where cases of oranges and Coca-Cola were stacked in a corridor that led to a dingy little galley . A small brass-rimmed portholelooked out the bow of the ship , and the roar of the engine nearly drowned out conversation . There was barely room for one person in front of the wide wooden counter where loaves of bread were stacked next to a large round of cheese and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee ship sometime within the next two hours , " Moshe shouted over the din . " They will be hun gry . " How many should I make ? " she asked , astonished at the amount of bread and cheese in front of her . " As many as possible . They will eat it all . " He dug a large butcher knife out of a drawer and handed it to her . " Welcome to theHaganah , darling , " he kissed her lightly . " What is this ? Some kind of initiation or something ? " She touched her finger to the dull edge of the knife blade . " If you can survive this "  --  he inched his way past her and out to the corridor  --  " we shall make you sergeant in charge of pots and pans . " She waved the knife in the air . " I feel like a pirate . " " The'British would agree with you on that point . " Then rubbing his stomach , he said , " If you get a free moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What else have I got to do ? " She took the first of twenty thickcrustedloaves from the stack and began to saw on it . Moshe laughed , then returned to the wheelhouse . The knife barely dented the crust of the bread and tore eachp204slice into ragged chunks . Ellie rummaged through the drawers of the galley but found nothing sharper than a butter knife among the mismatched collection of silverware and utensils . She attacked the cheese with frustrated fervor , until , two hours later , uneven chunks of cheese lay in piles next to mounds of torn bread . She slapped the sandwiches together , grabbed two warm Cokes and headed for the deck , exhausted . " Do n't you guys believe in knives that have blades ? " she asked without ceremony as she presented two thick sandwiches to Ehud and Moshe . Ehud gripped the wheel with one hand , his other encircling the sandwich as if it were a baseball . " Now this is what I call lunch ! " He attacked the dripping sandwich . " She is generous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facsimile of a sandwich , then attempted to find a side thin enough that he could take a bite . " Hmmm . Generous . " " If you do n't like it , Moshe "  --  Ellie crossed her arms and glowered  --  " youcan use it for bait . Dough balls and cheese work great off the Santa Monica pier . Maybe you 'll catch a swordfish , and you can cut your own bread ! " " I did not say a word . " Moshe pulled a piece of cheese from between the bread and munched contentedly . " I shall eat his ! " exclaimed Ehud . " It is good and plenty big . " " Thank you , Ehud , " said Ellie . " Back in the States we would call this a delicacy . Sort of , anyway . " " You see ? " Ehud opened his Coke with his teeth . " The girl has made us American sandwiches , and we are meeting the SS America . This is a good omen . Not to worry , Moshe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern . " Is there something to worry about ? " Moshe looked up and studied the horizon to the north . " The ship is late , or we 've missed her somehow . " " What will we do ? " " We shall wait . " Ehud swigged his Coke . " She shall come . "  |p205It  was past four o'clock . The cry of the muzzein had already echoed across the Old City , calling the faithful to prayer . Haj Amin , Mufti of Jerusalem , rose from his prayer rug and slipped on his shoes . Then he entered the patio where Hassan and Gerhardt waited . " My friends , " he said serenely , taking a seat across from them . He clapped his hands twice and a servant brought a silver pot of strong coffee and three tiny cups . Haj Amin poured the coffee himself and handed it to the men . " Have you seen the photograph in the American magazine ? " he asked . Hassan nodded , his eyes downcast . " You are responsible for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his cup clattering on the saucer . " We appear as murderers to the world , do we not ? " The Mufti snapped his fingers and another servant brought a copy of Life to him . He thumbed through the pages until he found the photograph of the tailor . " And the world weeps in sympathy for the Jews ? " He laughed as Hassan squirmed uneasily in his chair . Haj Amin turned his gaze on Gerhardt . " Have you prepared our gift for the Jews of Ben Yehuda ? " he inquired . Gerhardt nodded . " Good . But I fear we must prepare another first . " Gerhardt frowned and leaned forward , intently eyeing Haj Amin . " It is a small thing . " Haj Amin flicked his fingers and smiledp206slyly . " Hassan has told me he has seen the old woman , the housekeeperfrom the home of the red-headed woman . She visits your hotel frequently . Her son lives there , I believe ? " " Yes , " Hassan broke in , " and several other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amin cast a withering glance in his direction . " Quite enough , Hassan . " He coughed slightly . " It is , of course , the plan of the Jews to gain the sympathy of the world , to castigate us publiclyin the press with pictures such as these . I need not tell you , Gerhardt , publicity and terror go hand in hand . We must , I fear , delay our gift to Ben Yehuda Street until the world has opportunity to weep with us over the loss of Arab lives . " " What do you mean , your excellence ? " asked Hassan . " When the Jews bomb the Semiramis Hotel , who will say thatwe are unjust when we repay them an eye for an eye ? " " But the Jews have not  --  " Hassan began , only to be cut shortby a glance from the Mufti . Haj Amin smiled knowingly at Gerhardt . " It is but a few ChristianArabs , more or less . Would tonight be too soon , my friend ? " " Inch ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Allah wills . " " Allah and the Mufti . " Haj Amin threw his head back in laughterat his cleverness . A late afternoon breeze ruffled the water and the Ave Maria bobbed in the swells . Chin in hand , Moshe stared at the chessboard propped on a rope coil between Ehud and Ellie . " I think she has you , Ehud , my friend , " said Moshe , gulping down the last of Miriam 's zucchini bread . Ehud scowled . " The game is far from over . The day will not dawn when Ehud Schiff shall be beaten by a woman . " " The sun may set , however . " Moshe scratched his chin . Ellie smiled sweetly at Ehud , then moved her queen . " Check . " " Ha ! " exclaimed Ehud in disgust , slapping his fist on his knee . Ellie batted her eyes . " And a Gentile woman at that ! " " It is not yet checkmate ! " he protested . " Give it up , Ehud . " Moshe patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon for the hundredth time . As thick heavy clouds gathered to the north , the tiny swells of the early afternoon had become broader and deeper . " If they do n't arrive soon , " Moshe frowned , " we may be in trouble with the weather . " " Like the last time , eh ? " said Ehud with his eyes still intent onp207the board . " When you pulled the young beauty from the sea ? " Ellie looked up curiously . " That 's one I had n't heard about . " " A Venus , Moshe told me . She jumped and he saved her . Some lucky fellow will thank him one day , eh , Moshe ? " He nudged Moshe , who pretended not to hear as he raised the field glasses to his eyes and search the horizon for the thin trail of smoke that would announce the arrival of the SS America . " Did you pull her back into the boat ? " asked Ellie , no longer interested in the chess game . " Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast in his direction . " He swam all the way to shore with her . They spent the night on the beach and then he took her to Fanny 's  --  " " Moshe , why did n't you tell me you were such a hero ? " Ellie asked , feeling a rush of jealousy . Ehud rubbed his hands together delightedly and moved his only remaining rook . " It is your move , " he instructed Ellie . " It is just a part of this job , " said Moshe , still staring through the field glasses . " Ah , now , admit it , Moshe . " Ehud crossed his arms . " You would not have jumped in for an old hag ! " He narrowed his eyes with satisfaction as Ellie 's concentration disintegrated . " Shut up , Ehud ! " Moshe snapped . " Play . " Ehud shrugged innocently , " It is her move , is it not ? " " Was she really that pretty , Moshe ? " Ellie absently fingered her knight . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ehud stared hopefullyat Ellie 's fingers . " So move , already . " " I suppose she was , " Moshe answered irritably , " somewhat beautiful . " Ellie moved her knight without thinking , and Ehud clapped his hands together as he made the final move of the game . " Checkmate ! " he cried triumphantly . " So , my sweet Gentile lady , you lose ! " " You did that on purpose ! " Ellie protested . " I do not understand , " he grinned , gathering the chess pieces into an old shoe box . Moshe stood and walked to the bow of the ship , then peered through the field glasses at the thunderheads . There , in a thin line against the dark gray clouds , he saw a faint wisp of smoke . " There she is , " he called over his shoulder . " Looks like she 's just ahead of the storm . " " That is not good , " Ehud handed the box to Ellie . " We are latep208as it is . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them until dawn . " " I 'll bet the sandwiches are stale too , " said Ellie miserably as she wondered about the beautiful woman Moshe had rescued . " No matter , " said Moshe . " Let 's get her under way . " The sun was low in the sky when at last the Ave Maria pulled along side the rusting hulk of the freighter SS America , and one by one the refugees were lowered to her deck . Women and children far outnumbered the men , and Ellie overheard Moshe speaking in low tones to Ehud about the need for men of military age . " We must make it clear , " he said . " This must be the last group until statehood is established . From now on only young men . Or women strong enough to train to fight . It is too dangerous to risk transport otherwise . " Ehud nodded grimly , and Ellie hurried off to photograph the faces that seemed to reflect every argument for the statehood of Israel . Gaunt and hollow-eyed , cradling babies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bobbing little trawler . They carried small bundles of belongings or nothing at all , and Ellie thought of her own duffle bag stowed below deck . She probablybrought more for an overnight trip than these people even owned . Grateful but haunted eyes met hers as she helped a mother carry a baby down the steep steps . Ellie fought off a feeling of horror as she remembered the newsreels showing the concentration camps and the faces of men and women as they waited in line for death . What have these people lived through ? she wondered as they patiently took their places on the Ave Maria . No words were spoken that she could understand , but Moshe talked to each person in a kind and loving way , patting backs and shaking hands in welcome . A thin , knobby-kneed boy in short pants and a ragged sweater smiled up adoringly at her and Ellie noticed that his teeth were decayed . " How will he eat ? " she asked Moshe , aware that the boy would not understand her . " When one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoketo the boy in Polish and ruffled his hair affectionately . " We willmake sure his teeth are fixed . It is the scars we can not see thatbreak my heart . " He shook his head sadly , then directed the boyto the hold as Ellie snapped their picture together . Moshe 's eyesembraced the boy and Ellie thought once again how much Moshebelonged . Her heart filled with admiration for him , and she wantedto put her arms around him and tell him how very much she cared . When the last person was safely loaded and at last the Avep209Maria pulled away from the SS America , Ellie blinked back tears and touched Moshe 's back as he stood in the bow with the wind on his face . " I come here always . Every time after we pick them up . I think I will break sometimes , you know . " He gazed down at her and his face was streaked with tears . " There is a poem your uncle told me by a man named Byron . ' The birds have their nests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave . ' " " I heard it , but I never understood it before . " " Everyone has a country . Everyone but a Jew . These "  --  he motioned toward the hold  --  " they have returned from the grave . It is hardest for me when I think that God has allowed such suffering . And it becomes my suffering because these are my people . " Ellie wrapped her arms around him and laid her head against his chest . " I wondered the same thing after the riot . Uncle Howard said that God did n't do this . People did . And the people who did it do n't know God ; do n't have the slightest idea who He is . " " Perhaps he is right . " " I have n't really known , either  --  but I see this , and I think whoever God is , His heart must be breaking over the way we treat each other . And , Moshe , it makes me want to know Him and be like Him . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find what you are looking for . I hope the same for myself , that somehow someone can heal he wounds we can not see . It is difficult sometimes to be near suffering , is it not ? " " Makes me want to run and hide , " she smiled . " But the sandwichesare getting stale . " It was past curfew when Hassan entered the dingy lobby of the Hotel Semiramis . The desk clerk leaned against the counter reading the Cairo Times which was spread out before him . He stared intentlyat the front page , studying the latest pronouncements by Arab leaders gathered at Cairo University to discuss which course to take against the Jews of Palestine . While others talked , the Mufti in Jerusalem translated thought into deadly action . Hassan 's final task at the hotel tonight was only one small example of Haj Amin 's political savvy . Nine other members of Haj Amin 's staff had already left the hotel for Bab El Wad . Only Hassan remained behind to redeem himself in the eyes of his leader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed in the battered leather suitcase he now carried . Hassan glanced around the lobby . An old man dozed in a chairp210while another man stood in front of the iron gates of the elevator and argued with an old woman . Hassan instantly recognized her . " There , you see , Mother . " The man pulled a pocket watch from his vest pocket . " You must stay here with me and Sammy . " Hassan started toward the stairs , then hesitated . " I can not stay . The professor , he shall worry , " answered the old woman . Hassan smiled and turned back to the elevator . " And so shall I worry if you leave . My mother , must you be so stubborn ? We shall simply telephone in the morning when the exchangeis open . The professor would worry more if you were to leave now . " Hassan raised his hand to his mouth and coughed , interrupting the discussion between Ishmael and Miriam . " Tonight is not a night to be out . They say there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " exclaimed Ishmael . " Not half a mile from here . " " One can not be too careful . " Hassan reached past Miriam and pushed the elevator button . " Huh ! " Miriam grunted , crossing her arms in disgust . " The kind gentleman is right , Mother ; now , come along . " " Jews or Muslims ? " Miriam shook her head in resignation . " Most certainly it is the Mufti 's men tonight , dear lady . " Hassan pulled back the grate of the elevator and stepped aside for Miriam to enter . " That gangster ! " The old woman spat . " Perhaps there would be some hope for peace were the devil not in our midst . " " Mother , please . " Ishmael looked furtively around the lobby and gently urged her into the elevator . " Hoodlums . Ignorant bullies , all of them , " Miriam said loudly as Hassan lugged the suitcase into the tiny cubicle and pulled the grate shut behind them . " A little Hitler , this Haj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Alas , your words are so true , " said Hassan earnestly as the elevator lurched into a slow ascent . " Second floor ? " he asked as it ground to a stop . Ishmael shook his head , " No thank you . We are on the fourth . " Hassan stepped out into the darkened hallway of the secondfloor and closed the iron grate . " Pleasant dreams . " He smiledbroadly and nodded farewell . As the elevator groaned and whinedaway , he entered the room just to the right of the shaft . Switchingon the light , he glanced around , then carried the suitcase to thewall that bordered the shaft as Gerhardt had instructed him . Care/fully he unlatched the locks and lifted the lid to reveal the simplywiredbomb that contained enough TNT to demolish the hotel and shatter windows for half a mile . He wound the clock that would trigger the detonator and set the time for six o'clock the next morning . At that hour , people would just be waking up , though not yet out of their rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their impending death ; it was those last expressions of fear on the faces of his victims that he most liked to imagine . Ah , well , they would not die in their sleep , at any rate . He closed the lid of the suitcase , switched off the light and locked the door behind him . Then he skipped down the stairs , happy in the knowledge that , indeed , the innocent would die for the glory of Haj Amin , Mufti of Jerusalem . Throughout the night , the Ave Maria raced just ahead of the storm . A little past midnight , Ellie wadded up her jacket for a pillow , lay down in the galley between the counter and the icebox , and tried to sleep . Seasickness had begun to take its toll among the refugees in the crowded hold , and Moshe had resumed his post in the bow of the ship , watching for signs of a British gunboat . Just past four-thirty the little trawler shuddered and lurched . Ellie was suddenly jolted and rolled against the icebox . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked at her watch . For a moment she could not remember where she was or why , and a feeling of anxiety swept over her . She stood slowly , clinging to the countertop to keep from falling with the bucking of the Ave Maria . The ship , Moshe , the faces  --  all came back to her with a rush . She reached for a thermos of coffee that rolled across the galley floor and bumped her foot . Then she pulled on her jacket and made her way through the galley , past sick and sleeping refugees , and up the steps to the deck . The night was black as pitch and the rain fell , slanted and hard in the wind , stinging her face . She groped her way to the wheelhousewith the thermos bottle tucked under her arm . When she opened the door , Moshe stood at the wheel as Ehud took his turn with the field glasses . " I brought coffee , " she said cheerfully . Neither Moshe nor Ehud answered ; instead , Ehud took the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got us all right , " said Ehud . " Yes , " Moshe answered grimly . " And she 's signaling another . " " Sun will be up within an hour ; then we 're done for , " Ehudp212growled as he stroked the wheel . " This may be our last voyage , old girl , " he said gruffly . " It is not yet checkmate , my friend . " Moshe laid a hand on Ehud 's arm . Ellie stared bleakly out the window of the wheelhouse , watchingas the running light of a British destroyer cut through the water on a direct course toward them . " They are going to catch us ? " she asked . " Ca n't we get away ? " " We have been trying since two . " Moshe rubbed his forehead wearily . Ellie opened the thermos and handed the coffee to him . He took a swig , then handed it to Ehud . " We are not far from Naharia . " He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ehud 's voice was filled with a sad determination . " Use the wireless . Call the kibbutz . We 'll run her aground on the beach . Just let the British try and follow her up a sand bar ! They will drag their bellies three hundred yards out from shore . " " It is your ship , Ehud . Your decision . Are you certain ? " Ehud did not answer , but instead silently stroked the wheel and nodded . Moshe took Ellie 's hand . " Come with me . We have n't got much time . " Ellie followed him down the steps and onto the deck . Over the roar of the wind , she heard the engine of the destroyer . Then searchlightsclicked on and slammed against the darkness that had coveredthe Ave Maria . As the light engulfed them , Ellie raised her hand against the glare . She felt curiously like a rabbit caught in the road by the headlights of an approaching car . She wanted to run but there was no place to go . The wail of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on ! " Moshe cried , taking her by the arm and leading her down the steps . He stood on the bottom step and gazed over the pale faces before him . It was a recurrent nightmare , now becomereality . " For the past several hours , " he explained in three languages , " we have been pursued by a British destroyer . We turned back into the storm in hopes of evading her . It has done no good . Now we will run the ship aground . Crews will be on hand to help you to shore . Do not fear . " He raised his voice as a moan of panic filled the hold . " You will be taken care of . There is little time . Gather your things . " He hurried past the questions and Ellie followed him , feelingp213helpless as she encouraged , in English , people who could not understand her words . She tried to smile as she pulled her hands away from fearful , clutching fingers . " Are we going to be okay , Moshe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed , now is the moment to do so . " He strode down the corridor past the galley to a small room in the front of the ship . He struck a match and lit a kerosene lantern , then sat on a wooden crate and began to tinker with the dials of a black radio . Static crackled over the receiver . " It 's the storm , " he said impatiently as a high-pitched whine answered him . " Mary calling Gideon , come in please , " he chanted . " Calling Gideon . Mary calling Gideon . " God , help us , Ellie prayed silently . Help him get through . " Calling Gideon ... " The whine slid into a human voice that crackled back over the receiver . " Mary ... Gideon . . . you 're late . " " We 've got a wolf on our trail . We 're going to bring her in . " " How many ... repea . . . lambs ? " " Ninety-three . Repeat , ninety-three . " When Ellie returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick black clouds and the destroyer had been joined by a smaller gunboat . Ellie could plainly make out the movement of sailors on the decks of the ships and all eyes were turned toward them . The destroyer slid alongside , dwarfing the Ave Maria , causing her to shudder in its wake . " BY ORDER OF HIS MAJESTY 'S MANDATORY GOVERNMENT , " a stern voice bellowed over a bullhorn , " YOU ARE UNDER AR-REST . " Ehud pulled the whistle in response , then turned hard to the port and headed the Ave Maria straight into the shore and the breakers . " Get them up here , up on deck ! " he yelled to Ellie . Already Moshe had the refugees standing patiently in line and one by one he urged them onto the deck . Ellie helped with the children , calming them ; finally , when a young mother began to sob , she put her arms around her and comforted her without words . " Sing ! " Ellie shouted to Moshe over the wail of the siren . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sing " Be'Shuv Adonoy , " and every voice joined him in a hymn of defiance against the giants pursuing them . " TURN ABOUT ! " ordered the bullhorn . " TURN ABOUT STARBOARD , AVE MARIA . BY ORDER OF HIS MAJESTY ... " The refugees answered by singing louder as Ehud steered hisp214little ship nearer and nearer to the breakers . Ellie could see a group of men and women waiting on the beach ahead . She reloaded her camera and snapped pictures of the defiant faces of the refugees and the armor of the destroyer as the captain bellowed insults and threats and finally turned back from Ehud 's suicide course . The group on the beach launched two wooden lifeboats , pushingthem out past the breakers toward the sand bar where the bottom loomed up in anticipation of the Ave Maria 's final destination . " Hold on , everybody ! " Moshe cried as the little ship chugged steadily on . Mothers clutched their children to them and held on to one another , tucking their faces down against shoulders and backs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyer and her companion gunboat stood offshore and waited for the inevitable end . In the wheelhouse , tears streamed down Ehud 's craggy face and clung to his beard in glistening drops . " You 've been a fine lady . " He stroked the wheel . " I shall miss you . " He shoved the engine into reverse as the bar raised to meet her hull , and she slid onto the sand with a grinding thump and lodged herself securely . Ehud shut down the engine and clambered down the steps to help the passengers who had fallen to the deck . Strong-shouldered young men pulled against the oars of the lifeboats , moving quickly toward the crushed hull of the Ave Maria . Moshe rigged a lifeline from her bow and threw it to a curly-haired young man in a boat below . Calmly , women and children climbed down a rope ladder into the safety of the little boats . The stronger of the group and those who could swim moved to the bow and plunged overboard into the icy water , where members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to snap pictures until the last minute , then packed the camera back in her bag and handed it to the little boy who had smiled at her the evening before . " Tell him to hang on to this , " Ellie said to Moshe . Moshe put both hands on the boy 's shoulders and repeated her instructions in Polish . " And it ca n't get wet , " she added . The little boy nodded seriously and clutched it tightly to himself as he clambered down the ladder . " Okay , this is it , " said Moshe as the last of the group plunged into the water and grasped the lifeline to shore . " All out ? " Ehud climbed down the steps for the last tirne . The water wasp215knee-deep in the hold , but the damage was not so great that she could n't be floated again if it were not for the destroyer that waited for the last of the passengers to get clear . " All clear ! " he shouted to Moshe and Ellie . He joined them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raincoat . " It 's her compass , " he answered their questioning looks . " She has taken me many places , and I will not leave her . " Moshe turned to Ellie . " Can you swim ? " he asked , remembering his encounter with Rachel . " Sure . I spent half my life in the surf at Balboa , " Ellie laughed as she pulled off her field boots and jacket . " Race me . " Moshe stood at the bow as Ellie grimaced in anticipation of the cold water . " So jump , " he said impatiently ; when she hesitated just a moment longer , he shoved her into the murky gray water . Cold closed over her head and she came up sputtering and coughing just in time to see Moshe dive from the bow . " Well , come on ! " he shouted as he swam ahead of her with sure , steady strokes . She followed the hundred yards to the sand . Trucks from the kibbutz had pulled up behind the dunes , and by the time Moshe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refugees were already being loaded and driven to hiding places in the area . Ehud turned to gaze across the breakers to the Ave Maria perched forlornly on the sand bar . " Maybe you can float her again , " Ellie said hopefully . Ehud shook his head sadly . " It is not to be . " The three of them stood together and watched as the destroyer lowered her guns and took aim . The scream of the siren and wind was suddenly shattered by the flash and roar of a cannon , and the Ave Maria was splintered into a thousand pieces . " Checkmate , " Ehud whispered.  |p216David  dumped the contents of the mailbag onto the table , then looked around the room until he spotted Rachel in the far corner , nervously sipping a morning cup of coffee . He pulled the white envelope from his pocket and held it high above his head , " Quiet ! " he shouted , calming the din . " I got a letter here from the Jewish Agency that I am supposed to hand deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women turned toward David . " Seems there is a young lady here who 's been waiting for word about her family in Jerusalem . " Eyebrows raised as members of the kibbutz exchanged glances , then focused their attention on Rachel . Rachel remained silent , not daring to look up at David . He pivoted slowly , making certain that everyone saw the letter . Then he cleared his throat loudly , " Is there a Rachel Lubetkin here ? Rachel Lubetkin ? " Rachel set her cup on the table and stood shakily , biting her lip to control her emotion . She walked forward through the silent crowd , then stumbled , and a man reached out to steady her . " I am Rachel , " she said loudly . " It is my letter . " She held her eyes on David 's eyes , knowing he must certainly see her gratitude . She reached out for the letter and as he handed it to her she stepped back shyly and lowered her gaze . " Thank you , " she whispered . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anger flashing across his face as he spottedtwo women whispering together . " Mazel Tov , " he added . " Is n't that what you say ? Good Luck . " Without a word , she left the mess hall and tucking the precious216p217envelope into her pocket , walked quickly toward the orange orchard , now heavy with ripe fruit . She sat on the bank of an irrigation ditch and took the letter from her pocket . Clumsily she tore the letter open and held it in her trembling hands . Dear Miss Lubetkin , In reply to your inquiry of last week , we have conducted a search and are most happy to report that your grandfather is indeed living and in the Old City of Jerusalem . Under ordinary circumstanceswe would be pleased to assist you in the reunification of your family . The political situation at this time , however , precluded travel to Jerusalem . It is our hope that at a later date we will be able to assist you in relocation to the city of Jerusalem . Shalom and Best Wishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again and again . Grandfather was alive ! Her heart rejoiced that the old man 's heart still beat . The letter did not say if he knew of her . And she was uncertain about the phrase , " precludes your travel to Jerusalem . " Was she to leave today ? What exactly were they trying to tell her ? She puzzled over the words , feeling remarkably stupid and inadequate . And who , in this place , could she trust to help her understand the meaning of the words ? Behind her she heard a gentle knocking on one of the tree trunks , then an orange plopped beside her and she turned to find David standing on the opposite bank of the ditch peeling another . " Good news ? " he asked , jumping across and'sitting beside her . " Yes , " she said , emotion flooding her voice . " Yes . " She handed David the letter . " But I do not understand many of the words . " Quickly David scanned the letter . " Well , great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , huh ? " " Yes , " she nodded again , then pointed to the second sentence . " But what of this ? What does it mean , please ? " " Well . I think they 're trying to say that things are getting so hot there that you wo n't be able to get together with your grandfather until things are a bit more peaceable . " Rachel 's smile dropped away and she leaned over to study the words once again . " I must stay here , then ? " " Yeah . Looks like it . " He watched disappointment wipe away the joy that had only moments before lit up her face . " Only until this political situation gets settled , you know . Do n't worry . " " Then I must stay here , " she said dully , taking the paper from him . " For how long ? " she searched David 's face.  |p218He  pursed his lips , feeling her disappointment . " It may be a while . Honestly , I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She clutched the letter to her and lowered her head . She made no sound , but David watched as small drops fell on her skirt . He sniffed uncomfortably and patted her back awkwardly . He was once again the Tin Man , clumsy and stupid in the face of emotion . He searched for words to comfort her , but found none . Finally she wiped her eyes with the back of her hand and said , " He is so very old , you know . So very old . And I have no one else . " " I 'm sorry . " He frowned and threw a dirt clod at an orange peel on the ground in front of him . " I 'm really sorry , you know . But the Arab Legion has moved in on the roads from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . A beauty like you would n't get five miles past the blockades . Un-derstand ? " Rachel nodded . " You are the only way into Jerusalem , then ? " She looked at him hard . For a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry . Uhuh , not me . No way . They 've got a list of priority stuff for me to fly in , and you 're not on the list , I 'm afraid . Besides , once you get to Jerusalem , how are you going to make it into the Old City ? The Mufti 's got every way in and out covered . " Rachel continued to gaze at him in silence . David looked away from the question in her eyes . He had never , he thought , seen such hauntingly beautiful eyes . " Do n't look at me like that . I can deliver a letter for you maybe , but smuggle you into Jerusalem ? No way can I do that . No , ma'am . " She put her hand timidly on his arm . " It is all right , David . You have done so much already . I would never ask you to risk that . " David frowned and scratched his head . " Risk ? I do n't know that it 's such a risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed to feed the folks that live there now . That 's the risk . It 's no risk for me . " " Then I will find another way to get there . Perhaps I can make it over the roads . " " Wait a minute  --  just hold it . That would really be a risk ! You 'd be shot or taken hostage or  --  well , all kinds of things could happen . You 're a beautiful woman . Beautiful . " " Do you not think that I know what could happen ? I am familiar with what cruel men can do to a woman . " David looked quickly away . " What I meant was ... " She smiled sadly at him and took her hand away from his arm.  | " They told you of my past , David . I am not afraid of anything anymore  --  exceptliving alone . " David felt an ache of sympathy for her and searched his mind for an answer . " You wo n't make it to Jerusalem on the road . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ah  --  " He threw a wedge of orange peel into the ditch . " Have you got a place to stay until we can get you to your grandfather ? " " You will fly me , then ? " " I did n't say that . I asked you where you intend to stay ? " " I do not know . I know no one . " She frowned . " I will simply have to find Grandfather . " " You 've got to have a plan , Rachel . Do you think you 're just going to waltz right up to the Mufti 's men and walk through the gates ? Listen , " he paused thoughtfully , " I know a girl  --  a journalist . Maybe she can help . She can get into places where sane people fear to go . " He laughed at Rachel 's questioning stare . " Anyway , I 'm supposed to pick her up , along with another guy , in Naharia this afternoon . Maybe you can stay with her for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? Today ? " David threw down his half-peeled orange , shaking his head in disgust with himself for being such a sucker . " Go get your stuff . " Rachel ran back to her quonset dormitory , clutching the letter tightly to her . She paused at the door and smiled at the women who had just returned from breakfast . A thin , cruel-lipped woman looked at Rachel as she stuffed a small canvas bag with her few belongings . " Going somewhere , Rachel dear ? " the woman sneered . Rachel did not answer . Instead , she finished packing , then stood erect and squared her shoulders , looking each of her tormentorsstraight in the eye . " I am going home , " she declared at last . Then she turned and walked from the room and across the grassy square to the mess hall . She pushed the door open and stood for a moment searching for David among the members of the kibbutz . He sat near the far end of the room among a small group of men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse brown bread with orange marmalade , but he had not eaten . Instead , he sat quietly listening to the BBC of Palestine . A voice announced in frantic , heavily accented English : " This morning just past six o'clock Jewish terrorists attacked and bombed the Arab hotel Semiramis in the Jerusalem suburb of Katamon . Thep220death toll at this time is eleven , with many more believed to be buried in the rubble . The staff of Hadassah Hospital has opened its doors to the injured and dying ... " Rachel stepped back and shut the door slowly , then walked toward the plane waiting in the field . She had grown so tired of the talk of death and dying all around her . Just for this morning , she wanted only to think about living , about her grandfather , about the home she had heard her mother speak of so many years ago . She unlatched the door of the little plane and threw her bag behind the passenger seat , then climbed in and closed the door behind her . Sunlight warmed the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaning her head against the glass windowpane , she gazed across the plowed field into the orchard beyond . A young couple walked hand in hand along the edge of the field and disappeared into the orchard . Tears filled Rachel 's eyes as she wondered what loving words were spoken in the shadow of the branches . Such words she had never heard  --  and never would , nowthat she bore the mark Nur Fur Offizere . No man would ever see past that mark to love her . David pulled open his door with a clang , startling her back to reality . " There you are ! " he exclaimed . " I thought maybe you had chickenedout . " " Chickened out ? " " Changed your mind , " he smiled . " No , I have not , " she offered , shaking her head . " Well now 's your chance . Another hotel just went up in smoke . Radio says the Haganah did it . Nobody around here seems to believe that , so we got us a real mystery on our hands . Killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Terrible , " she said . " Sad for everyone . " David climbed in and flipped the ignition switch while two strong Sabra men cranked the propeller . The engine roared to life , and then the plane bounced over the rough terrain and slowly lifted into the air . David circled the kibbutz once and dipped his wings in salute as Rachel gazed , enthralled , at the tiny buildings and trees below her . A feeling of peace flooded her , and for the first time in years she felt unfettered . " It is wonderful ! " she shouted at last over the noise of the motor . " Ever flown before ? " He smiled at her , and Rachel thought shehad never seen such a handsome man . She looked quickly away . " No . But I like it very much , thank you . " She sensed his eyesp221were still on her . She glanced at him . Then as he held her eyes with his own she said , " I know what you are thinking . You must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd think about . I was just thinking that you must be some kind of lady to have come out of those experiences still sane . " " Sanity is simply a matter of perspective , is it not ? " " I guess that 's one way to look at it , especially if you 're the one in a straitjacket . " " Everyone , I think , wears a straitjacket at one time or another . " David grinned . " Like I said , that 's one way of looking at it . " Rachel sat silently , afraid to say more  --  afraid to say too much . Finally she asked , " This girl I am to stay with , she is your girl ? " " She 'd say that 's a matter of perspective , " David laughed . " But you are . . . you love her ? " " Yep . " He banked the plane and set course for Naharia . " Have you known her very long ? " " Three years  --  since 1944 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " No . " " No , I guess not . " He scratched his chin . " It was a terrific place where servicemen could go to dance and meet girls . It was in Hollywood  --  you know , where they make movies . You know about movies ? " " I have never seen one , but I have heard  --  " " Anyway , sometimes movie stars like Lana Turner and Betty Grable would show up  --  gorgeous dames . " David 's voice became animated at the memory . " But believe me , they got nothin ' on you ... " Rachel tried to follow his words and translate them into Polish when a phrase escaped her comprehension , but only bits and pieces of the whole came through . " And you met your girl there ? " she asked , hungry to know stories of love and courtship . " Is she a movie star ? " " No . But she could be . Red hair ... " " A shiksa ? " " Whatever . Anyway , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Glenn Miller . And I said to myself that she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen ... " He paused and looked hard and long at Rachel , his smile fading . " What is it ? " she asked . David looked into her eyes and felt lost for a moment . " Nothing ,  |p222I  just did n't know anybody really had eyes like that . That 's all . " " Her eyes are beautiful , then ? " " No . I mean , yes  --  gorgeous ! But I was talking about your eyes . They are beautiful . " Rachel looked away , studying her hands clasped in her lap . She felt a rush of embarrassment , even shame , that he had noticed her . " My eyes have seen too much to be beautiful any longer , " she said . " Nonsense . You 're still a person , are n't you ? " " I have not thought so for a long time , David . " " Well , you are . And someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'll be standing with a group of girls talking  --  " " Like your girl was ? " " Like Ellie . And some guy will spot you across the room and that 'll be it . He 'll say , Hey , beautiful , do you want to dance ? '  --  just like John Wayne or somebody ; and he 'll sweep you off your feet . " " It sounds like a lovely dream , " Rachel sighed . " An American dream . " " Yeah ? How do they do it here ? " " The matchmaker arranges for a suitable family . " " Arranges ? " David asked , incredulous . " Oh , yes . My parents had arranged for my marriage with a boy not far from Warsaw . I had not met him , but I spent my days imaginingwhat he must be like . " " How old were you when this all got settled ? " " Nine . " Her eyes sparkled . " Quite old . Many are betrothed much younger . " David shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sanity is a matter of perspective , " he laughed . " So what happened to him ? " Rachel looked away nervously and sat in silence for a long moment . " He was  --  " she paused , searching for words to convey the horror of Nazi occupation : starvation , mass graves , mindless murder . Finally she chose the simplest terms . " He died . . . with his family . And my mother and father and brothers  --  everyone , even the matchmaker . " David swallowed hard . " I 'm sorry , " he said quietly . " Dumb ques-tion . " " They took me from the line , " she continued as if unable to stop the flood of memories . " I was stripped and examined . Then I was branded and used for the pleasure of the men who murdered my family . And I was no longer a person . " " How old were you ? " " Fourteen . "  | " A child . " " Full of dreams . " Her eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not shared this with anyone . There has been no one who has seen me among so many . " David gripped the control stick hard as he imagined her loneliness . " There must be someone who would understand , " he said . " To my own people I am a traitor . I should have died . I should have ... " Her voice trailed off . " I had a friend once . " The engine droned as Rachel 's face clouded with the memory . " She was a year younger than I. She became pregnant , and she knew she would be gassed . It was a rule , you see . So she stabbed a Gestapo colonel . " She closed her eyes . " They lined us up in the morning and made us watch her execution . I only wished that I could have been so courageous . " David felt inadequate , groping for words of comfort . " But you lived through it all . In my book that takes a special kind of courage . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brimmed with pain . " I would have given anything to be that American girl on the dance floor . I am twenty-one now , and my dreams are all buried in the ashes of Auschwitz . At night I lie upon my bed and ask God where He has gone , why I was not allowed to die . He does not answer . " Ellie and Moshe stood anxiously beside a truck parked at the side of the Naharia airfield . The radio blared the news of the Semiramisbombing , and Ellie shivered , not from the cold of the day , but from wondering at the fate of Miriam 's son and grandson . The old woman will be frantic , she thought . The little Arab family had only each other. .. the names of the dead and wounded have not been released , pending notification of kin , " the radio announcer continued . Moshe put his arm around her . " Your uncle will be there with her , Ellie . There is little you can do . " " I know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . Moshe , if we are working for and with people who could do such a thing .. . " It was not Haganah , " he said irritably . " That much I can tell you . Maybe those idiots in the Irgun would do such a thing . Maybe it was an accident . I do n't know what to tell you , but it is not Haganah . I would have known . I would not have permitted it . " " Her grandson is a violinist . " Ellie imagined broken bodiesp224among the rubble . " A violinist , " she repeated . " It just seems so ridiculous that somebody like that could be hurt ... " Moshe rubbed his hand wearily across his forehead . " Six million violinists , poets , dreamers , and doctors died within the last six years simply because they were Jewish . Nobody ever said any of this makes sense . Perhaps the story of just one is more moving than the numbers . Perhaps it is too hard to imagine that so many died without cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened for the faint drone of David 's airplane . She switched off the radio and sat forlornly on the edge of the truck running board as the sputtering speck in the distance took shape and finally circled slowly above them . Moshe looked at his watch . " He 's late . " " As usual . " David landed smoothly on the concrete runway , and without switching off the engine rolled to a stop near the truck . He opened his door and dumped out the mail sack for a Sabra woman to retrieve ; then he waved to Moshe and Ellie to board . Moshe opened the door of the buzzing little aircraft and helped Ellie into the back where Rachel sat crosslegged on a mail pouch . Seeing Rachel , Ellie balked and glared suspiciously at David . " Hurry up , " said David . " I 'm late . " " We noticed , " said Ellie dryly as she took her seat next to Rachel . As Moshe boarded , David made quick introductions . " Rachel Lubetkin , this is Ellie Warne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . " You must be David 's girl . " " A matter of opinion . But I 'm Ellie , anyway . " She returned the smile . " And this is Moshe Sachar . " Moshe turned and recognized Rachel in the shadow of the cargo area for the first time . His smile faded as he was once again astonishedat her beauty . Then he beamed , " You ! " " It is you ! " she exclaimed in delight as she reached out and shook his hand vigorously . " I see you two have met , " said David cheerfully as he taxied out to a much slower takeoff than usual . " One very dark night , Mr. Sachar taught me to swim , " Rachel replied . A surge of jealousy passed through Ellie as she realized that this must be the woman Ehud had used to win the chess game.  |p225Every  word he had said about her was true  --  and then some . " You have been well ? " Moshe asked , his eyes lingering in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me locate my family . " She pulled the letter from her sweater pocket and handed it to Moshe , who read it quickly . " Mazel Tov , " he said sincerely . " So now you are returning home . " " If there is a home to return to , " quipped David . " Did you hear we blew up an Arab hotel ? " " In the first place , it was not our men . And Ellie has friends staying there , " Moshe shot back angrily . " Oh  --  " David 's bantering ceased . " Sorry , Els . Open mouth , insertfoot , huh ? " Rachel bit her lower lip in concern and gazed sympathetically at Ellie . " I hope no one is . . . injured . " She wanted to reach out and put her hand on Ellie 's arm in comfort , but instead she crossed her arms and looked away . " I am sorry . " " David , you remember Miriam ? " Ellie ignored Rachel . " It 's her son and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " Tough as a boot . " " You are a picture of concern ! " Ellie snapped sarcastically . Moshe changed the subject quickly . " Where does your family live ? " he asked Rachel . " It is only my grandfather . He is a rabbi in the Old City . " " Do you have a place to stay until you can get in ? " Rachel looked nervously toward David . " Well I ... I mean , Davidthought  --  " David chewed his lip thoughtfully . " I figured maybe Ellie could put her up for a few days . " Rachel looked down at the mail sack , pretending not to notice the look of aggravation that crossed Ellie 's face . " But if it is any bother ... " Ellie glared at the back of David 's head . " No bother at all , " she said with difficulty . " Good , " Moshe rubbed his hands together . " Then it is settled . " " Did n't I tell you Ellie was terrific ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Rachel studied her with eyes full of understanding . She hesitantly reached out and tapped her light on the arm . Ellie turned slightly without looking her fullp226in the face . " I 'm all right , " said Ellie . " A little edgy , maybe . Worried , you know ? " " I can find a hotel room if it is an inconvenience . " " Forget it . Really , " Ellie felt ashamed of her jealousy . " It will be all right . " Rachel gazed solemnly down at the road below and the tiny trucks that crawled along toward Jerusalem . Ellie spotted Uncle Howard in the lobby of Hadassah Hospital immediately . He sat at the end of a long row of nearly empty chairs , his face unshaven and his clothes rumpled . In his hands he held the small pocket Bible that he always carried , and as he studied its pages , his face was a strange mixture of sorrow and peace . Miriam 's beautiful Sunday shawl lay folded neatly beside him on the chair . As Ellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , a dark foreboding filled her heart . " Uncle Howard ! " She leaned down and hugged him tightly . Then , picking up the shawl , she sat beside him gazing pensively into his eyes . Howard drew a deep breath and blinked back tears , " Such a waste . Such a terrible waste . " " Sammy ? " she asked . " He 'll live . Broken arm , cuts ; that 's all . " " Thank God . Ishmael ? " Howard shook his head slowly . " No , " he replied simply . " Oh , Uncle Howard ! " Ellie cried , her voice cracking with emotion . " Poor Miriam ! Poor old dear ! " She glanced around the lobby . " Where is she ? Is she all right ? " Howard placed his hand on Ellie 's arm . " No . She 's gone , child . " " Gone ? Gone where ? Is she at home ? " She clutched the old woman 's shawl to her , afraid of the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tucked his chin and tried to speak . Ellie 's eyes filled with painful comprehension as he cleared his throat and wiped away the tear with the back of his hand . " She stayed with them last night , " he said finally . " At the hotel . " " Miriam ! " Ellie buried her face in the shawl as the emptiness of loss pressed in on her . " She is safe now , child , " Howard wrapped his arms around her . " She has gone home . " " The last of thirty bodies was recovered today from the rubblep227of the Semiramis Hotel in the Jerusalem suburb of Katamon . AlthoughHaganah sources deny involvement in the bombing , other sources indicate that the hotel was being used as a military headquartersby Arabs . No members of Arab military staff were present , however , and only civilians were numbered among the victims . British High Command called this latest act of violence by Jews against Arabs dastardly . . . the murder of innocent people . ' " Haj Amin lowered the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting across from him on the patio . " A vile act , do you not agree , Rabbi ? " he asked grimly . Rebbe Akiva shook his head in shame that Jews had resorted to such acts against the innocent population . " My heart is breaking that such as these would call themselves Jews . " " You see our dilemma , then ? If we were to allow passage into the Jewish Quarter , what guarantee would we have that the Old City would not be polluted with these Jewish fanatics , these murderersof the innocent among my people ? " " It was my thought , Haj Amin , that perhaps an arrangement could be made . For the sake of my people in the Old City . " Haj Amin 's eyebrows raised slightly with interest . " Arrange-ment ? " Akiva toyed with the watch chain stretched across his belly . " It has occurred to me that we might make a little exchange . There is a possibility that I might obtain something you want very badly . " Haj Amin leaned forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have that I could possibly desire , my friend ? " " Victory . " " That is mine , at any rate , " Haj Amin shrugged and leaned back in his chair . " Are you so very sure ? " Akiva smiled knowingly . Haj Amin cleared his throat , then poured coffee for Akiva and himself . " And for this promise of victory against the Zionists , what would you receive in return ? " Akiva confidently sipped his coffee , " The preservation of the Jewish Quarter . For the sake of my people . The places of learning , the synagogues . " " Ah , yes , " Haj Amin smiled . " Immortality for the name of Akiva , eh ? Savior of the old ways ? " " Just as the name of Haj Amin Husseini shall also be immortal among his people . " " That goes without saying . " Haj Amin set his cup on the low table before him . " Immortality . A simple enough request . "  | " I thought perhaps we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest . " And there is one more item I require , " he added , certain that such a small request would be honored without question . " Of much less value than the Old City , I presume ? " " It is but the whim of a poor scholar such as myself , " Akivabowed his head humbly . " A small thing , of little interest to anyone else , and certainly of no importance whatsoever to the world . " " In exchange for victory ? " Haj Amin smiled slyly . " What can this small request be ? " " I find the photographs of the scroll quite intriguing , the story of its discovery even more so . I would very much like to study this thing , to have it in my library for reference ... " Haj Amin coughed delicately into his handkerchief , then raised his chin to scrutinize the man sitting opposite him . " Perhaps . Perhapswe may accommodate your wishes , Rabbi . " He paused for full effect . " But at present , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it has served its purpose , we shall make it a gift to you . " " What possible use could you have for such old scrolls of ourprophets ? " Akiva asked curiously . Haj Amin 's face hardened for a brief instant ; then he sipped his coffee . " Is it not written in your own holy books that the Word of God draws men unto itself ? "
