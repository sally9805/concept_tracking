The military moves toward democracy , but suffers election losses <P> Even though the occasion was deadly serious , something of a carnival atmosphere descended on Brazil last week , months ahead of its early-spring schedule . About 50 million voters joked and gossiped as they waited at polling stations throughout the vast , rapidly developing Latin American country . The reason for Brazil 's mildly intoxicated mood : for the first time since the military forces took power in 1964 , citizens were freely exercising the right to choose well over 40,000 political officeholders at almost every level of government . <P> Only one vitally important officeholder remained exempt from the democratic process : Brazil 's fifth consecutive military-appointed President , Joao Baptista Figueiredo , 64 , who will not step down until 1985 . Before the voting , Figueiredo , a folksy , blunt-spoken former cavalry general , hailed the elections as a vindication of his three-year policy of abertura ( opening ) , the promise of a slow and gradual return of democratic freedom to Brazil . Said he : " We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> The results of the balloting , however , promise to give recurring headaches to Figueiredo and his conservative Social Democratic Party ( P.D.S. ) . In the process of choosing thousands of city councilors , mayors , state assemblymen , federal congressmen , senators and state governors , the voters delivered an unmistakable rebuff to the military-sponsored authoritarian regime . At week 's end , results were still trickling in from the balloting exercise , in which voters in Brazil 's remote Amazonian hinterlands were forced to travel by truck , airplane or even dugout canoe in order to register their electoral preference . <P> Nonetheless , it appeared that opposition candidates were poised to win governorships in at least eight states , containing 56% of Brazil 's estimated 121.5 million people . Already given up for lost by the P.D.S. was the governor 's race in the wealthy state of Sao Paulo ( pop . 25 million ) , the teeming industrial hub that produces about 40% of Brazil 's $283 billion gross domestic product . The likely winner in Sao Paulo was Andre Franco Montoro , 66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Said Montoro of his assumed victory : " Our only commitment is to substitute democratic practice for the abuse of power . " <P> For Figueiredo 's military backers , an even more alarming outcome loomed in the major southeastern state of Rio de Janeiro . There , a front runner in the gubernatorial race was Leonel Brizola , 62 , a charismatic populist and onetime left-wing orator who was governor of Brazil 's southern state of Rio Grande do Sul at the time of the 1964 military coup . Brizola , who used to extol the virtues of Fidel Castro , has been cited by military men as one of the reasons that they seized power in the first place . At week 's end Brizola was leading his P.D.S. opponent , 694,000 votes to 653,000.
