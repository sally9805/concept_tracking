For nearly four decades , the story of what happened to nearly 1 , 000 Aleuts ( almost one-third of the Aleut race ) in the war has been hidden from the public  --  first by military censorship and media indifference , then by the aleuts ' own traditional shyness and diffidence . Even today , elders refuse to talk about their wartime experience . Says Leo Merculief of St. George Island , who was two years old when war broke out , " The parents have tried to shield us children from the experience. " // Now , however , Aleut leaders have demanded a public hearing for that experience . They have convinced the federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians , established by Congress last year to investigate the complaints of Japanese-Americans interned during the war and recommend possible redress , to give equal attention to the Aleuts . The commission ' s earlier hearings  --  in Washington , Los Angeles , and San Francisco  --  have focused entirely on the Japanese-American internees . But as the hearings moved to Seattle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Unulaska , Aleut natives and emigres are unlocking their memories . For the first time , they are telling their story , a catalog of injustices caused by their own government ' s " protection " // The windswept , treeless Aleutians and tiny Pribilof Islands  --  St. George and St. Paul  --  stretch like a georgraphic afterthought on the western edge of Alaska . Their native people , the Aleuts , related to the Eskimos , were isolated from the outside world by distance , culture , and deliberate US policy . They were little prepared for the turmoil and exile brought on by World War II. // The United States was likewise unprepared for the Japanese attack on the Aleutians . In early June 1942 the Japanese bombed the Army and Navy Stations at Dutch harbor on Unalaska Island , also hitting the hospital at the nearby Aleut village where Sara Merculief lived , and overran the westernmost islands , of Attu , Kiska , and Agattu . American authorities feared a further invasion would sweep down the underprotected " overbelly " of the Alskan coast. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a teen-ager on the Pribilofs . ( Alexander is not his real name ; he asked not to be identified for fear of jeopardizing his military pension . ) In its haste to brace for the invasion that never came , the War Department decided to evacuate the Aleutians west of Unimak and the Pribilofs . In June and July 881 Aleuts were crowded into military transports and private steamers and carried to improvised relocation camps on the southeast Alaskan coast . Other Aleuts , fearing the military buildup and the rumor of war , had already fled inland where , says august Heitman , a Kodiak Aleut , " They drifted all over , to Anchorage and down to Seattle . A lot of them never came back. " // " They must have been wise somehow , to leave like that , " Alexander says . " They never had to go through the ordeals we went through " . // For the next two to three years , the Aeuts were confined to isolated , ramshackle camps in squalor deprivation. // The largest camps were an abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , where the Pribilof Aleuts were kept , and another abandoned cannery at Burnett inlet near Ketchikan , where Unalaska , Biroka , and Makuskin villagers were lodged . According to government agents ' own reports , the buildings in these camps were just empty single-walled shells , in poor condition with floors crumbling from dry rot , windows smashed , and no supplies . " There was nothing at funter Bay when we arrived , " recalls Daniel Benson , Fish and Wildlife Service agent and virtual governor of St. George Island . " It was a terrible scene  --  over 600 of us , all bedded down on the floor. " // Throughout their two-to-three-year stay , the Aleuts and the government agents ( who the military had originally tried to evacuate to Seattle ) struggle to make the camps livable . Families hung wool blankets around their tiny spaces to gain some semblance of privary . The Aleuts cooked communal meals in primitive kitchens from meager government supplies . Efforts to dig sewer lines at Funder Bay were frustrated by the shallow sil , and waste was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a single beach outhouse. // The refugees turned to that polluted by for food . " I lived on clams for months , " recalls Archpriest Michael Lestenkof of St. Paul . Poor sanitation , meager diet , and crowded conditions resulted in deteriorating health in the camps . " We lost more people at Funter Bay than 10 years at St. George , " Benson recalls. // This strangeness o the new environment exacted another toll . " They were terrified of the trees , which they ' d never seen before , " recalls Benson ' s wife Kitty . " They said they couldn ' t breathe. " // " The islands were all they knew , " says Michael Stepetin of Unalaska . " I think for many of the old folks , the experience was just more than they could take . " Many younger aleuts chafed at the confinement and left to seek jobs in the coastal towns , despite the prohibitions of the government agents. // Inspecting doctors protested the way Aleuts were kept " virtually prisoners of the government , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Interior Department , which administered the Aleut villages , looked forward to a speedy return . But War Secretary Harold Ickes refused the Interior Department ' s requests , declaring " occupation of the Pribilof Islands was made possible by using the housing of the former occupants , and insufficient housing exists for both troops and the native population . " Unalaska saw familiar occupation ; plans were made , but never completed , to turn its cathedral into an officers ' club . After the war , the government refused to let the Attuans return to their village , which it replaced with a Coast Guard station. // Ickes finally consented to let the Pribilof men return for the summer of 1943 to harvest their islands ' fur seals , which each year brought the Fish and wildlife Serivice a million-dollar profit . While their wives and children languished at Funter Bay , the hunters took a record harvest. // Finally , in 1944 and 1945 , the survivors were returned to their villages . They found their homes devastated by the occupying troops : doors and windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all personal property  --  including treasured religious icons  --  removed . " People lost everything , and just had to start all over again , " says Paul Swetzol of St. Paul. // President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a total of $10 , 000 for all Aeut claims damages by the military  --  about $12 per person . Many never even saw that ; some received as much as $300 , still only a fraction of their losses. // Nevertheless , monetary compensation doesn ' t seem a main priority for many , perhaps most Aleuts . Some , in Alexandra gromoff Tu ' s words , " just don ' t ever expect to get anything from the government. " **28;8340; v. <> hy do it now , when we needed it them ? " Sara Flory asks bitterly . What all demand are answers to questions which bear on basic constitutional principles . " Was it fair to do what they did to us ? " Stepetin asks . " Am I allowed to go into your home and tell you to leave , even for military security ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true story . Show us it was in our interest. " // The current inquiry into the wartime relocation comes at a time of dramatic , often traumatic change for the Aleuts . After over 100 years as " wards of the government , " the Pribilof Aleuts are striking out on their own  --  with nervous apprehension . The federal government is not only withdrawing its management of their islands , but also the subsidies which have supported them since the seal harvest stopped paying its expenses a decade ago . In the Aleutians , native management corporations established under the Native Claims Settlement Act have likewise brought new independence and burdens. // Even now , Dr. John Campbell of Seattle , who was stationed on St. Paul before the war , expresses the view which underlay a century of government paternalism : " The Aleuts are fine people , but they ' re just like children .
