Of the six teams entering the event , one was from Inner Mongolia , two from Shandong Province , one from Tibet , and two from Xinjian , near the border with the Soviet state of Kazakhstan . The Xinjian riders and horses had to travel one-seventh of the globe to reach Yaumatai , which is 600 miles southeast of Peking . Their trip took 16 days - 4 by truck and 12 by train. // // The Tibetans , new to the game , purchased their horses in Xinjian on the way to Yaumatai . Because of long travel time in China , most competitors and horses were away from home for 2 to 3 months. // The few dozen competitive horses in China are owned by a handful of riding schools . Most are resilient native-bred animals which resemble the American mustangs . It was , after all , on the plains of central Asia that the horse was probably first domesticated . Some of the Mongolian horses are of Russian stock . The Chinese effort to develop this Western sport , one which is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of many signs of how communist-led China is opening up to outside ideas and influences. // Two years ago , the Hong Kong Jockey Club gave 40 thoroughbred racehorses to China . But these horses have proved too excitable for most Chinese riders . One Mongolian rider was able to train a Hong Kong horse to jump very high . But he did not bring it to the contest , believing the horse was not tough enough to survive the eight-day trip from Inner Mongolia. // By the second day of competition , the Mongolians were well ahead in jumping ( the Chinese have yet to tackle the more precise equestrian art of dressage ) . Two Mongolians were the only ones to have figured out how to bring their horses properly to an obstacle . Most others relied on raw speed . This helps prevent the horse from stopping before the jump , but it doesn ' t help him from knocking it down . The others also use a rousing yell - ' ' hh-aa-ii ' ' - in hopes it will get the horse over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hh-aa-ii ' ' is similiar to the cry of a karate expert trying to splinter a plank without breaking his hand . The horseman ' s ' ' hai ' ' is designed to blast his steed over a plank , hoping not to break anything. // There were 23 riders , all male , from a blue-eyed , curly-haired Cossack from Xinjian to a tall , green-eyed Mongolian . Many , however , fit the more standard Chinese type. // Being generally of poor income , the competitors nonetheless were correctly attired in riding jackets , breeches , and boots . But a few looked uncomfortable with the unaccustomed necktie , a required item in international competition. // One rider whose name - Bater - sounds appropriately like batter , managed to knock down over 20 jumps during the six rounds . The rider who garnered the best score for the second year in a row was Ge Er Deng Tu , a Mongolian with a Russian horse. // Chinese officials are highly conscious of their ' ' developing-country status ' ' in the sport , often stating that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have much opportunity for good coaching . ' ' But they also consider jumping a macho sport and expressed great surprise when told that women riders have earned higher scores than men in the same competition in other countries. // In between this year ' s European-style jumping events , small boys on saddles piloted other horses in flat-out races over distances ranging up to an astonishing six miles . The racehorses are leggy things , so scrawny that they hardly look capable of carrying their jockeys . Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because they are so lean , Xinjian horses fly like the wind , beating their more rounded opponents. // In Xinjian , these races are held across courses as long as 15 miles , the young jockeys riding bareback .

Opponents on horseback grapple until one is able to unseat his opponent and bring him onto his own mount . ' ' This is very difficult , ' ' says a large Xinjian man , shaking his head . But these games require very different skills from those needed for jumping. // The International Equestrian Federation introduced the competition here as part of its effort to develop riding in countries with little means to support the sport , an effort which has proved worthwhile , as Chinese riders have improved over the years . In most countries where competitive riding has developed , winners take home prize money as well as honors. // In China , each of the top six placers in this year ' s event also received a prize - a teapot .
