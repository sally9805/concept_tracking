" We have always been poor , " said an illiterate farm laborer , Hari Charan , whose family has lived in the same colony of mud hovels for 14 generations . " We have to go hungry for many days , and sometimes we have to starve. " // This is Bihar , a state of 80 million people that represents the other face of India , a country that has made overall economic gains in recent years . Desperately poor and struggling under barriers of caste , Bihar ranks at the bottom of all the country ' s indexes of handicaps . It is a state that can not feed itself , with an annual per capita income of $111 , lower than in the poorest countries of the world. // // Corruption and Lawlessness // But Bihar is not merely India ' s poorest state ; it is also its most corrupt , violent and lawless state . Hundreds are reported killed here each year in scattered incidents , most of which are given little prominence in the Indian press . The dead are victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police and " armies " fielded by feudal landlords. // The landlord armies have set fire to entire colonies of poor peasants , throwing men , women and children into bonfires or burning shacks . In other incidents , the peasant militias have " executed " landlords , decapitating them and leaving their bodies and heads in nearby fields. // The violence came to a boil last year at the village of Arwal , where , journalists and witnesses said , at least 23 people were killed when the police fired on a crowd of 2 , 000 peasants demonstrating for their rights . <> <> The Pervasive Caste System // The peasant organizations include self-proclaimed Communist radicals who supply the disaffected with homemade guns . Even an old truck ' s steering wheel can be fashioned into a gun barrel at one of dozens of makeshift factories reportedly operating in the area. // Discrimination on the basis of caste was supposedly outlawed years ago . But the system survives at its most virulent in Bihar , establishing a hierarchy of the helpless . At the bottom of the rung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God " - that is the term for untouchables coined by Mohandas K. Gandhi - toiling under a feudal system of land and labor. // In violation of India ' s land-redistribution and minimum-wage laws , upper-caste landlords pay as little as 50 cents a day to peasants who are often beaten or evicted if they refuse to go along . Untouchables at the village of Nadaul said they had been forced to move from a nearby village to escape such brutality. // " Early in the morning , they would send for us to work in the fields , " said Budhram Manji , a lanky man wearing a torn T-shirt . " If I became sick , they would beat us . If they were just passing by and we were sitting on a cot , they would beat us. " // Forced to borrow money for seed or fertilizer at interest rates as high as 100 percent , the sharecroppers become increasingly indebted to their landlords until , in some cases , they can no longer pay and are " bonded " to the land to work under threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been outlawed , but authorities say it still exists in many parts of India , notably in Bihar . In some cases , the peasants start out owning their land , only to lose it , along with their freedom , when they fall into debt . Where the Poor Become Poorer Bihar symbolizes a paradox of India ' s economic progress . In cities , towns and even villages elsewhere , an emerging middle class of perhaps 100 million Indians has been buying cars , motor scooters , soft drinks and television sets , stimulating the strongest economic boom the country has enjoyed since independence 40 years ago. // In the north-central farm belt , a " green revolution " of advanced seeds , fertilizers and cultivation techniques has helped yield 20 million metric tons of surplus buffer stocks of grain nationwide , eliminating the old specter of famine and mass starvation. // Bihar reflects the question of what happens when the disparity between the haves and the have-nots stirs increasing resentments among those left behind. // The state ' s needs far outstrip the assistance it gets . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , with payment made in the form of grain , people in Bihar are still hungry and malnourished. // Advocates for the poor , citing statistics , say per capita consumption of cereal grains , beans and lentils - the diet staple of the poor - has hardly increased throughout India in recent decades . At the same time , the poor have also been hit hard by inflation. // Because of these factors , many experts say that the talk of overall progress is illusory and that many in Bihar not only are being left behind but also are falling back. // " Our industrial and agricultural policies help the places that are already advanced , " said Dr. Pradhan H. Prasad , a Marxist economist at the Sinha Institute in Patna , a research organization serving the Bihar government. // " The ' green revolution ' has bypassed Bihar , " he said . " Because of rising prices , the harijans and peasants of this state are actually seeing their standard of living decline . " A Common Complaint : The Paying of Bribes Bihar itself looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are irrigation canals , power lines , tractors and television aerials in many villages of the north-central farm belt , but in the Gaya region the roads are crumbling , the irrigation ditches are uncompleted and the water pumps , the tube wells and the power lines are broken . Even a transistor radio is a rarity . Bihar , especially the north , is hit almost every year by floods or drought . Peasants in the central part of the state wear tattered clothes and have a ravaged look as they toil in the fields or dig ditches , load rocks and spread asphalt under government road-repair programs. // In interviews , many peasants said they were somewhat better off than a few years ago , if only marginally , becuse of access to Government employment programs . Others said they were able to purchase bullocks or bicycle rickshaws with Government loans. // The nearly universal complaint , however , was that they often had to pay bribes and that much of the money intended for the poor had been siphoned off by the middle- and upper-caste administrators of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling behind. // At a road project , Rajender Bind , a 35-year-old harijan , smoked a crumpled cigarette , coughed and said he could find work only a few days a month . His income , he said , has failed to keep pace with rising prices of rice , clothes and cooking oil. // " When we get hungry , I can try to catch some fish in a pond , " Mr. Bind said . " Our lives are worse than 10 years ago . I tried to go to the bank to get a loan , but they asked for bribes and I couldn ' t pay. " // In most villages , landlords complained that peasants were unwilling to work hard for their wages. // " They start late , and they ' re always taking time off to eat or drink or rest or go to the toilet , " said Lakhpati Prasad , a 72-year-old landowner . " Ten years ago , one laborer could harvest four fields in a day . Now you ' re lucky if he does two. " // A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lazy. " // The stereotype is widely held , despite evidence that Biharis are some of the hardest-working people in India . Escaping the poverty of their home villages , they can be seen pulling rickshaws and toiling in jute factories in Calcutta and working on mountainous roads in the Himalayan foothills . Some 400 , 000 travel to the fertile fields of the Punjab to do the menial harvesting that Punjabis decline to do themselves. // Caste discrimination is officially prohibited , but it remains pervasive throughout India . One of Bihar ' s biggest handicaps is that because of ancient migration patterns , nearly a quarter of all Biharis are in the lowest castes and tribes , the highest proportion in India. // " It is not just economic , " said Shashi Bhushan , a civil-rights activist connected with the Sinha Institute . " It ' s on racial lines , because 90 percent of the harijans are black and the upper castes are light-skinned or white. " // In the village of Mohkar , for instance , the untouchables living in squalid and dusty mud hovels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musahars , " which literally means " rat people. " // A lone well had been installed in their colony under a Government program . But the villagers said the contractor sank it only halfway , pocketing the money for a completed job and leaving them without water . When the harijans tried to drink from a nearby common well , they said , the landlords prevented them , finally pouring in diesel fuel so that no one could use it. // When a visitor came into their colony , the lighter skinned Brahman landlords accompanying him began ordering the harijans to move away . The Brahmans refused to leave during the interview and interrupted the harijans at several points. // An old woman said a day ' s pay for fieldwork was less than four and a half pounds of coarse grain , despite a legal minimum wage of more than six and a half pounds. // " You tell the truth ! " a Brahman interrupted , adding that a laborer actually got more than six and a half pounds a day. // " I am telling the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us anything . " A Brake on Change : The Powerful Landlords Indian law requires that no individual own more than 30 to 75 acres of land , depending on its quality . But officials acknowledge that in northern Bihar landholdings reach 10 , 000 acres , with interlocking family networks circumventing the restrictions. // The children of these landholding families receive good educations in India or the West , and some serve in Parliament and the state legislature . The feudal class is generally said to win elections by delivering voters to the polls in trucks or buses. // In other cases , bribery and intimidation are involved . Elections in Bihar are known throughout the country for the practice of " booth capturing , " as gangs representing different interests , including low caste peasants , storm their way into voting places and make off with the ballots. // State officials say they have tried to break up illegal landholdings and distribute the surplus to landless peasants , but have achieved limited success because of time-consuming litigation. // But critics say that the Government is half-hearted and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state has been distributed. // A powerful example of the stalemate lies near the town of Buddh Gaya , a famous religious center in central Bihar where 2 , 500 years ago Buddha is believed to have sat under a tree and achieved enlightenment. // In the nearby village of Shekhwara , a movement of harijans has tried for years to break up the 10 , 000-acre estate of a powerful Hindu religious leader who controls the land on behalf of his monastery. // Next to the village , a 300-acre section of arable land lies fallow because fights have erupted every time one group tries to cultivate it . The movement to distribute the land has basically failed. // But most of the landholdings in south and central Bihar are much smaller , usually under the legal ceilings . Much of this land is cultivated by families of landlords who are themselves of lower caste. // After independence , many Moslem landlords fled to Pakistan , abandoning estates that were then taken over by lower-caste groups who worked hard to develop and cultivate the property . The authorities said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than the big feudal landlords of north Bihar. // In the village of Bamani , for example , the landlords are from the increasingly prosperous Koiri Mato , Kumhar and Yadav castes that took over their fields from Moslems and now live in trim brick houses with tile roofs. // The harijans , living on the outskirts of the village amid flies and sewage , say they make a fraction of the minimum daily wage of $1. 20. // A middle-aged man with a vacant face , Shri Das , said he had been plowing a field when a boy from the Yadav caste threw stones at him . He chased the boy , he said , but was attacked and beaten by a crowd of Yadavs. // A neighbor said Mr. Das was now almost deaf from the beating . " We are treated like dirt , " the neighbor said. // Today , various peasant activist groups are spread out in central and southern Bihar . Many are still nonviolent in approach , but some engage in violence or strikes and demonstrations that often result in bloodshed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has deteriorated , and officials acknowledged to the press last year that the radicals were running " parallel governments " in several Bihar districts . Law and Order : It ' s Getting Worse The leader of one militant group , Rameshwar Prasad , said that his people organized strikes in 150 villages in the last year and that clashes and killings had often erupted as the landlords brought in outsiders to farm the land. // Three months earlier , Mr. Prasad said his group , the Bihar Peasants Organization , had been holding a rally when it was attacked by an army of Rajput landlords armed with guns. // " The police were helping them , " he said . " We got surrrounded and beaten . But we are not going to be halted . Today we are organizing in more villages than ever. " // Police lawlessness has been a longtime problem in a state infamous for an incident in 1980 , when the police used acid to blind dozens of prisoners. // " For any revolutionary movement , the police will be seen as an instrument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bihar , S. B. Sahay . " We are not biased along caste lines . We get the blame when the root cause of all the violence is socioeconomic. " // The worst incidents of violence in Bihar have been massacres and clashes between far-leftist peasant militias and caste-based landlord armies . Hundreds are said to die each year in these incidents , but some say the number is closer to thousands. // The armies , or " senas , " are fielded by upper level castes , such as the Rajputs and Bhumihars , as well as lower-middle castes like the Kurmis and Yadavs. // The peasants are represented by three main groups - a faction of the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) , the Maoist Communist Center and a group called the Worker Peasant Struggle Organization. // In their papers and statements , leaders from these groups say they follow the revolutionary principles of Mao Zedong . The radical groups take their cue from a movement known as Naxalites in the neighboring state of West Bengal in the 1960 ' s . Even today , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though they belong to different rival groups . The Peasant Violence : Government Steps In Violence is a way of life in a state that officially recorded 3 , 300 killings last year , a number that is almost certainly an underestimate. // Since the late 1970 ' s , however , Indians in the rest of the country have become shocked by the occasional acts of slaughter every few months - the beheadings , mass burnings of men , women and children , the cases of people being lined up and shot and the sporadic jailbreaks. // Government officials acknowledge that the peasant violence has lately spurred them into action , targeting villages where there has been conflict over new houses , roads and schools. // Mr. Sahay , the police commissioner , said tensions had eased because of a Government crackdown on the radical militias and the landlord armies , both of which were officially outlawed last summer . Villagers in Bihar report a drop in violent incidents , but they say they fear bloodshed can resume at any time. // As a result of the crackdown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price on their heads , peasant groups said. // The surge in violence in the last year has aroused the concern of political leaders in Patna , the state capital , and New Delhi , where aides to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi have been pushing the local government to step up land redistribution and channel investments in irrigation and other plans to increase farm production. // Bindeshwari Dubey , the Chief Minister of Bihar , the state ' s highest elected official , said in an interview that the Government had begun " pumping in more money " since he took office two years ago to try to quell the violence. // " We have certainly tightened our law enforcement , " Mr. Dubey said . " We are trying to build houses and put in water pumps so the peasants will realize that we are on their side . We are beginning to see some success. " // But journalists based in Patna said dozens of members of the state legislature had been suspected , and in some cases accused , of various crimes , including murder and association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at its heart , Bihar ' s problems stemmed from indifference by the police and other senior authorities who receive payoffs to look the other way or have simply adjusted to the system with no interest in changing it. // " Any kind of progress is going to touch on the vested interests , " he said . " The people who donate funds during the elections are the ones who call the tune . Even our Government bureaucrats are from the landed class . Unless there is a strong political will , we will never have reform. " //
