A story . by Lewis Nordan i HAD BEEN fishing for an hour and still had n't caught anything . I was fishing for chickens . Mama would n't let me walk to the town pond by myself . What else was I going to fish for ? I looked back over my shoulder through the torn-out screened door and tried to see Mama in there . I said , " Mama . " I was using the voice that says you 're being real good and not fishing for chickens . Mama said , " You better not be fishing for chickens , Sugar Meeklin , you going to get switched . " She 's got this ability . She was out in the kitchen , that was good anyway . I put a fresh kernel on my hook and scattered shelled corn on the slick dirt yard below the porch and dusted off my hands on my white blue jeans . A handful of old hens came bobbing and clucking up to the corn and poked at it with their heads and then raised their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again . I dropped the baited hook in amongst them . I wished I could figure out some way to use a cork . The chickens bobbed and pecked and poked and scratched . I moved my baited hook into the middle of the chickens and eased it down onto the ground and waited . I still did n't get a bite . My daddy did n't much care whether I fished for chickens or not . My daddy knew T never would catch one , never had , never would . It was my mama who was the problem . She said it would ruin your life if you fished for chickens . I was n't studying ruining my life right now . I was thinking about hooking and landing some poultry . I was n't using a handline , which is easy to hide if your mama comes up on you . I was using a cane pole and a bream hook , little bitty rascal of a hook . I liked a handline all right , I was n't complaining . Nothing better for fishing in real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot day when the chickLewis Nordan teaches at the University of Pittsburgh and is working on a novel about Sugar . ens are settled down in the cool dirt and have their neck feathers poked out like a straw hat and a little blue film of an eyelid dropped down over their eyes . A handline is fine for that . A cane pole is better from off your porch , though . Or I guessed it was . I never had caught a chicken . I had had lots of bites , but I never had landed one , never really even set the hook in one . They 're tricky , a chicken . I really wanted to catch one , too . I wanted the hook to snag in the beak , I wanted to feel the tug on the line . I wanted to haul it in , squawking and heavy and beating its wings and sliding on its back and flopping over to its breast and dragging along and the neck stretched out a foot and a half and the stupid old amazed eyes bright as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake . Sometimes I let myself believe the chicken I caught was not just any old chicken but maybe some special one , one of the Plymouth Rocks , some fat heavy bird , a Leghorn , or a blue Andalusian . And sometimes , as long as / was making believe , I thought I might catch an even finer specimen , the finest in the whole chicken yard . I thought I caught the red rooster itself . The red rooster was a chicken as tall as me . It seemed like it , I swear , when I was ten . It was a chicken , I 'm telling you , like no chicken you ever saw before . It could fly . There was no half-assed flying about it . It could fly long distance . Daddy said it could migrate if it had anywhere to go . It could n't do that , but it could fly fifty times farther than any other chicken you ever saw . This was a chicken that one time killed a stray dog . I dreamed about that rooster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handline and not on a cane pole . I dreamed I caught it on a limber fine six-and-a-half-foot Zebco rod and spinning reel , like the ones in the Western Auto store in Arrow Catcher . That 's the town I used to live right outside of when I was little , in the Delta . The line on that Zebco spool was almost invisible . 1 WATCHED the chickens . There was a fine old Plymouth Rock I would just love to catch . She dusted her feathers and took long steps like a kid wearing his daddy 's hip boots . I moved the bait over closer to her and held my breath . She started poking around at the corn . She hit the bait once but did n't pick up the hook . My line was taut , so I felt the strike vibrate through the line and down the cane pole to my hands , which I noticed were sweating . I thought , If she hit it once , she just might ... But she did n't . She stopped eating corn altogether and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to listen for my mama . Mama could n't be expected to stay in the kitchen forever . I needed to say something to her in my **27;2692;TOOLONG voice , but I could n't . The Plymouth Rock pecked the earth a few times , but not the bait . Then , all of a sudden , she shifted position a little and pecked right down on the corn with the hook in it , the bait . For the second time that day I felt a strike vibrate through my hands . But the chicken missed the hook again and I jerked the bait out of her mouth . She did n't know what happened to it . She looked like , What in the world ? I repositioned the bait , and the hen started pecking around it again . I had to say something to Mama . I held real still and tried to talk in a voice that maybe a chicken could n't hear . In my head I invented a voice that seemed like it was going to be all throaty and hoarse and animallike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , it did n't make any sound at all , not even a whisper , just a little bit of released breath and a wormy movement of my lips . I said , " Mama , I ai n't fishing for chickens . " Nobody heard it , not even me . The Plymouth Rock hit the bait a third time . It was n't possible to catch a chicken . I knew that . My daddy had convinced me . He said , " A chicken is dumb , but not dumb enough . " So I knew it was impossible . But I also knew it had happened . I had the Plymouth Rock . I jerked my pole skyward and set the hook hard in the chicken 's beak . The sound that rose up out of the chicken 's throat was a sound that nobody who has never caught a chicken on a hook has ever heard . It sounded like **52;2721;TOOLONG . I was anchored to the porch , with the butt end of the pole dug into my groin for support . The heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line in midair . The sound did n't stop . The sound was like the fire siren in Arrow Catcher . As beautiful and as scary as that . It was like a signal . I thought it signaled danger and adventure and beauty . I was screaming too , along with the chicken . I did n't even know I was screaming . I heaved on the heavy bird . The pole was bent double , I wanted to land the chicken . I wanted the Plymouth Rock on the porch with me . I could n't pick it up high enough . It was too heavy for me . It was up off the around , all right , but I could n't get it high enough to sling it onto the porch . The chicken was beating its wings and spinning in a wild circle . I held it there . I heaved on the pole again . The bird swung up and around , but was still not high enough . It hit the side of the house and then swung back out into midair . Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew she was back there , because I heard the door slap shut . At first I did n't look back . I just stopped hauling on the chicken . I was still holding it up off the ground , though . I could n't give it up yet , not all of it , even though I had stopped trying to land it . Finally I did look back . The face of my mama , I thought , was the saddest face on this earth . It just had to be . I said , " Hey , Mama , " real subdued , trying not to provoke her . I was still holding the chicken off the ground , and it had n't stopped making its noise . I said , " I been fishing for chickens . " No sense lying about it now . I expected my mama to say " I swan , " like she always said when she meant " I swear . " What she really said surprised me . She said she was a big failure in life . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see why she did n't just go off and eat some poison . I eased the chicken down onto the ground . It got loose and scooted off toward the garage with its feathers sticking out . Mama cut a switch off a crape myrtle and switched me good on my bare legs and went back inside the house . She laid across her bed on the wedding-ring quilt my grandmama Sugar gave her when she got married , with hers and Daddy 's names sewed in a corner and a heart stitched around the names , and had herself a long hard cry . And so that part of it was over . SME - " A O TIME passed . Some days and , I guess , 1 some weeks . I watched my mama around the house . At night , after supper and after she had wiped off the table , she would do what she liked best . She would lay out on the table a new piece of cloth from Kamp 's Low Price Store and pin to it a tissue-paper Simplicity pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of silverware from the dark chest lined with green felt . The silver came from my mama 's grandmama who lost her mind and threw away the family Bible and almost everything else and so left only the silverware , which she forgot to throw away . Mama would get the pattern all weighted down , and she would look around for a minute , in her sewing bas-ket or in a kitchen drawer , and say . " Has anybody seen my good scissors ? " She would find the scissors and bring them to the table and cut through the paper and the cloth . She wouid poke through her sewing basket . I saw the faded pincushion and the cloth measuring tape and a metal thimble and about a jillion buttons and the pinking shears . She would lay down a towel to keep from scratching the dining-room table and then heft the heavy old portable Kenmore onto it . She might have to thread the bobbin . She might lift the cloth to her nose and breathe its new-smell before she put it into the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate . She would touch the pedal with her foot . Before any of this would happen , before supper even , my daddy would come home from work . I could hear the car pull into the drive and head around back of the house . He would get out of the car , and he would be wearing white overalls and a paper cap with the name of a paint store printed on it . He would smell like paint and turpentine and maybe a little whiskey . Daddy would shoo the chickens back from the gate in the fence where the chickens flocked when they heard his car . He would open the gate and ease inside , real quick , before anybody could get out . I would watch him . The chickens were gossipy and busy and fat and fine . Daddy would scatter shelled corn from a white metal dishpan , and pour out mash for those that needed it , and run well water into the troughs . I always wished Mama would watch him do this . I thought that if she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I went down the steps and into the chicken yard with him . He let me reach my hand into the fragrant dusty corn and pelt the old birds with it . Then there was the part where the rooster attacks you . Every day I forgot it was going to happen , and then it would happen and I would think , Now why did n't I remember that ? It happened today , this particular day , I mean , a Tuesday and just before sunset . The rooster was on top of us . It had n't been there before , and now it was all I could see , the red furious rooster . Its wings were spread out and its hones were creaking and clacking and its beak was wide open and its tongue was blazing black as blood . And the rooster 's eye  --  it looked like it had only one eye , and the eye was not stupid and comical like the other chickens ' . It seemed lidless and magical , like it could see into a person 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the feet  --  they were blue colored , but blue like you never saw before except in a wound . And the spurs . And then it was over . Today , like other days , Daddy kicked the chicken in the breast with the toe of his work shoe and it flopped over on its back . It righted itself and stood up and started pecking at the corn on the ground . Daddy walked over to49 the rooster and petted its neck . The bird made a stretching motion with its head like a cat . Then there was the next part . We watched the rooster eat . Without warning , as we knew it would , it stopped eating . It stood straight up and cocked its head so far that the comb flopped over . It looked like somebody who has just remembered something real important . Then the rooster took off . Any other flying chickens you see are all hustle and puffing and heaving and commotion and getting ten feet maybe , no matter how hard they work at it . This chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , or a wild turkey . There was nothing graceful about it , nothing pretty . It was just so amazing to watch . When the rooster flew , it looked like some fat bad child who has rung your doorbell and is running down the street away from your house , slow and obvious and ridiculous , but padding on anyway , uncatchable . It flew out and out , over the chicken-yard fence , over a little side yard where Mr. Love kept a goat , over the trailer the midgets lived in , out farther like a kite , over a house , and finally into the branches of a line of hardwood trees across the railroad tracks . T E WENT inside the house then , and Daddy went into the bathroom and I came out after a long time with his new smells of Fitch 's shampoo and Wildroot and Aqua Velva and his wet combed hair . The whiskey smell was a little stronger , a little sweeter . After supper , and after the sewing machine was turned off and put away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hem it , and it 'll be all done . " She was on the sofa , so she sat up straight and held the dress up to her front and pretended like she was modeling it . Daddy was moving out of the room . He was weaving a little when he walked . on his way to the kitchen . I looked at Mama . She had a pleased look on her face that made me think she thought she looked pretty . She did look kind of pretty . I picked up the package the pattern came in . There was a color picture of two women on it . I said , " Where do these ladies five , Mama ? " She took the package out of my hand and looked at it with the same look on her face . She looked off somewhere away from my eyes and said , " I think maybe these two ladies live in New York City . They live across the hall from one another in a penthouse apartment . I think they just met up downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handed the pattern package back to me . I said , " What are they talking about ? " Mama said , " Hat . " She took the package from me again and looked at it , serious . She said , " I think maybe , well , maybe the lady in the red dress is saying why do n't we go somewhere real nice today . 50 She 's saying why do n't they shop around a little and then maybe go to a picture show . They might even be talking about going to the opera , you do n't know . " I tried to think about the opera , men in turbans and women in white powdered wigs . The men carried sabers at their sides , and the women had Derringers in their purses . I said , " I ai n't studying no opera . " Mama laid the package down and put the new dress aside too . She started poking through her sewing basket for something , but then stopped without finding it . She had lost the look she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the opera ? " She said , " No . " I said , When you put that dress on . you know what ? " She did n't answer . I said , " You ai n't going to look like neither one of those ladies . " I do n't know why I said that . Mama got up from where she was sitting . She said , " Do n't say ai n't , Sugar . It will ruin your life . " She got up off the sofa and went into the bedroom and closed the door . Daddy came back into the living room . He was wobbly and ripe with whiskey . He said , " What happened to Mama ? " I said , " She 's laying down . " He eased back into his chair and started to watch " Gilligan 's Island " on the television . I went to my room . I sat on the bed and let my feet hang off . I had to do something . I felt like I was working a jigsaw puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy and the chickens and the midgets and Mr. Love 's goat and I thought I could never get it worked . I started to fish for the rooster . Sometimes I fished with a handline , sometimes with a cane pole . The rooster never looked at my bait . I fished every day , and every day I got older and the rooster did n't get caught . School started up again and I got new shoes . The leaves finally fell off the trees and I helped Mama rake them up in the afternoons . The rooster hated my bait . He could n't stand to look at it . I changed bait . I used raisins , I used jelly beans . I used a dog turd . You got to want to catch a chicken to bait a hook with dog turd . Chickens eat them all the time , no reason it would n't work . It did n't though . I threw the cat in the chicken yard . I had ten hooks dangling off the cat , feet and tail and flea collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rooster killed the cat , but it did n't take a hook , Too bad about the cat , but you 're not going to catch a rooster without making a sacrifice or two . After a while fishing for the rooster and keeping Mama from knowing about it became like a job , like an old habit you never would think about breaking . All that mattered was that I fish for him , that Inever give up , no matter how hopeless , no matter how old or unhappy I got . s  - -  - Ni OMETHING happened then that changed things . It was Saturday . I got on my hike and pedaled from my house to the picture show in Arrow Catcher . There was always a drawing at the matinee . Mrs. Meyers , the old ticket-taker-upper with the white hair and shaky hands and snuff breath  --  she would do the same thing every time . She would take your ticket out of your hand and tear it into halves and tell you what a fine young man you were growing up to be and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawing . I walked down the aisle and found me a scat up close to the front . I looked at the torn ticket in my hands , and the other seats filled up with people . Mr. Gibbs owned the picture show , called it the Strand Theater . The lights were all on bright and Mr. Gibbs climbed up on the stage by a set of wooden steps around the side . He was huffing and sweating , waving his hands for everybody to be quiet . Like he said every Saturday , he said , " Be quite , boys and gulls , be quite , please . " We laughed at him , and the underarms of his white shirt were soaked with sweat . I watched Mr. Gibbs crank the handle of a wire basket filled with ping-pang balls . Every ball had a number on it . Mr. Gibbs would draw them out , one at a time , and put each one on a little cushioned platform with the number facing out to the audience , until he had four of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was something he loved to do , you could tell . He would call out each number in its turn , real loud and exaggerated . He would say , " Fo-urrr. " or " Nye-unn , " and he would hold up the white ball and show everyone he was n't cheating , and then he would put the ball on the cushioned stand . You had to like Mr. Gibbs . Then it started happening . The first number he called out was the first number on my ticket stub . And then so was the second . It seemed impossible that the number in my ear was the same number as in my eye . It kept on being the same number , digit by digit , right down to the end . I had won the drawing . I had never won anything before . One time I won a pink cake in a cakewalk . It tasted terrible and I hated it , but I ate all of it anyway , same night I won it . I had never won anything except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing . But winning was nothing compared to the prize I was going to take home . I had won the Zebco rod and spinning reel from the Western Auto . Mr. Gibbs was standing up on that little stage like a sweaty fat angel . He was giving his heartfelt thanks to the Western Auto store , homeowned and homeoperated by Mr. Sooey Leonard , and to all the other fine local merchants of Arrow Catcher who donated these fine prizes and made these drawings possible . I went up on the stage . I climbed the same dusty wooden steps that Mr. Gibbs had climbed . I showed Mr. Gibbs my ticket stub . I was trembling . He shook my hand . and my hand was sweaty and slick against his manly palm and fingers . Mr. Gibbs asked me if I did n't think every single other person in this fine audience ought to take his patronage to the Western Auto store and all the other fine local merchants of Arrow Catcher . I said , " Yessir , " and everybody laughed and clapped their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my fine prize . I said , " Going fishing . " and everybody laughed again . Mr. Gibbs said why did n't everybody give this fine young fisherman and all our fine local merchants of Arrow Catcher another round of applause , and so everybody did . I do n't know what was on the movie . I sat through it . and I watched it , with the fishing rod between my legs , but I did n't see it . I remember a huffing train and some wreckage , I remember an icy train platform and taxicabs and a baby growing up rich instead of poor . Barbara Stanwyck married John Lund , I remember that . Whatever was on the movie , one thing was 411 I was thinking about and that was that I was definitely going fishing , no doubt about it . The fish I was going to catch was as tall as me and had red feathers and was big enough and fine enough to ruin the life of every soul in Arrow Catcher , Mississippi . I LOOK RACK at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , the fence of chicken wire . I smell the sweet fresh fragrance of grain and mash and lime and chickenshit and water from a deep well poured through troughs of corrugated metal . I smell creosote and the green pungent shucks of black walnuts under the tree . I see the trailer the midgets lived in and the goat next door . I see myself , a boy , holding the Zcbco rod I won at the Strand Theater . The Zebco moves back , then whips forward . The line leaps away from the reel , from the rod 's tip . It leaps into S 's and figure eights . It floats like strands of a spider 's web . At the end of the line I see the white fleck of sunlight that covers the hook : the bait , the kernel of corn . I watch it fly toward the rooster . I look ahead of the corn , far down the chicken yard , and see the rooster . It seems to be on fire in the sunlight . For one second I lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a rooster . I do n't believe it long . I come to my senses and know ' that the rooster is a chicken , that 's all . A very bad chicken . He is the same miserable wretched mean bad son-of-a-bitch that my daddy51 has called him every day of the rooster 's life . I remember that the rooster is smarter than me , and faster and stronger and crazier . I remember that I am in the chicken yard with him and that he does n't like me and that my daddy ai n't home from work to protect me and my ass is in trouble , Jack . I understand , at last , what the rooster is going to do . He is going to catch the bait in the air , like a dog catching a Frisbee . I ca n't believe what I am watching . The rooster has positioned itself , flat-footed , with its mouth open , its head cocked to one side . Until this moment I have not believed I would ever catch the rooster . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is all I have thought about for a long time . And now , in the presence of an emotion something like awe , I understand that the rooster is about to catch me . It happens . The rooster , at the last moment , has to lurch a step forward , it has to duck its head , but it does so with perfect accuracy . The bird might as well have been a large red-feathered frog plucking a fly from the air . He catches the baited hook in his mouth . I do not move to set the hook . There is no point . The roaster has been fishing for me for three years , and now it has caught me . I have become old enough to catch . At eleven I am old enough to believe that doom will always surprise you , that doom is domestic and purrs like a cat . The bird stands quiet with the bait in its mouth . The line droops to the ground from his chicken lips . I stand attached to him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooster is a beast and without humor . Then it does move . At first I thought the creature was growing taller . Nothing could have surprised me . I might have been growing smaller . Neither was true . I was watching what I had watched many times . / was watching the rooster take flight . 1 T LEFT the ground . The hook was still in its mouth , attached to nothing . The rooster was holding the hook in its mouth like a peanut . More than ever the bird seemed on fire . It flew out and out away from me . The nylon line trailed it in flight . The sun shone on the rooster and on the line and told me that I was in big trouble and had not yet figured out how . It flew over the chicken-yard fence , over the goat , over the midgets . It gained altitude . I watched the line be stripped in coils from my open-faced reel . The bird flew and flew , high as the housetops , and then the treetops , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living kite . It took me a minute to see what the rooster was up to . I had never seen him do this before . Just when he was almost out of sight , out over the railroad tracks and ready , I thought , to light in the hardwood trees , the bird seemed to hang suspended . It 52 seemed to have hung itself in midair and to have begun to swell out like a balloon . I was holding the fishing rod limp in my hand and studying the rooster 's strange inflation . The rooster , above the treetops , ballooned larger and larger . It grew large enough that I could distinguish its particular features again , the stretched neck and popped-out eyes , the sturdy wings and red belly feathers . Nothing about the appearance of the rooster made sense . And then everything did , I was not looking at the bird 's tailfeathers , as I should have been . I was looking him in the face . He was not growing larger , he was coming closer . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rooster had turned around in flight and was coming back after me . I looked at him . The rooster had cleared the goat and the midgets . It was big as a goose , big as a collie . Its feet were blue and as big as yard rakes . I dropped the fishing rod into the dirt . I turned to the gate and tried to open the latch . I could hear the rooster 's bones creaking and clacking . I could hear the feathers thudding against the air . My hands were clubs , the gate would not come unlatched . I pounded at the gate . I heard the rooster set its wings like a hawk about to land on a fence post . The rooster landed on my head . It did n't fall off . I thought it might , but it did not . It clung tight to my scalp by its fierce toenails . I clubbed at the gate with my useless hands . The bird stood on my head , and its wings kept up their motion and clatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving by the wings for the fire the feet had lit in my brain . I tried to climb the gate , but my fret had turned to stumps . The chicken yard was in hysterics , the Plymouth Rocks and Leghorns and blue Andalusians . I clung to the gate with the rooster on my head . I imagined flames the shape of an angry chicken rising from my head . I screamed , and still the rooster held on . It drubbed me with its wings . My eyes were blackened and swollen , my nose ran with blood . I did n't care , so long as someone put out the fire in my scalp . I got the idea that it could be put out with water . I gave up at the gate and ran stumbling across the chicken yard . Layers and pullets and bantams , all the curious and hysterical , fanned away from me in droves . The rooster hung on . I reached the hydrant hopeless . There was no hope of putting my head under the spigot while wearing the chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was of no use . If I could not open the simple latch of the gate , there was no chance I could retrieve the garden hose from its wall hook and screw it to the spigot . My mama was standing on the back porch watching . I longed for the days when I was young enough to be switched with crape myrtle . I saw her start to move toward mc . She was moving toward me but I knew she would never reach me in time . Blood and chickenshit ran down the sides of my face and into my ears . The wings kept up the pounding , and the rooster 's bones and ligaments kept up the creaking and clacking and clicking . I had not noticed my daddy drive up but now I saw his car in the driveway . He left the car and was headed toward me . He also moved in slow motion . I left the spigot . My motion and my parents ' motion had become the same . They stood at the gate and pounded at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not open for them . I motioned for them to stay where they were . They saw that I knew what I was doing . Something had changed in me . I was not running now . The rooster was still riding my head . I walked , purposeful , like a heavy bear through the chicken yard . And yet my steps were not heavy . My life was not ruined . I could wear this chicken on my head forever . I could bear this pain forever . In a year no one would notice the chicken but myself . Then even I would not notice . My mama had believed that spending your life in the place of your birth , absorbing its small particulars into your blood , was ruination . I looked at my parents beside the gate . My daddy held my mama in his arms as they stood at the edge of the chicken yard and looked at me . My daddy had gotten the gate open now but again I held up my hand and stopped him . I knew now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself that I would live the rest of my life to prove true : they watched their son wear this living crowing rooster like a crown . They were proud of me .

They believed that a man who has worn a chicken on his head  --  worn it proudly , as I was beginning to do  --  would never be a fool to geography or marriage or alcohol . I stood tall in the chicken yard . My parents looked at me from the gate and I felt their love and pride touch me . They believed that a man and his wife with such a son could not be ruined either , not yet , not forever . The rooster had stopped flapping its wings It was heavy on me , but I straightened my back and did not slump . Now it balanced itself with more ease , it carried more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stood on my head like an eagle on a mountain crag . I strode toward my parents and they toward me .
