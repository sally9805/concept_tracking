It should be an occasion for throwing hats and blowing horns . This Friday marks the opening of two films that were made separately by directors who were once husband and wife . Evelyn Purcell 's Nobody 's Fool and Jonathan Demme 's Something Wild have more in common than the eleven-year marriage of their directors . Both are romantic comedies about a normal guy and a kooky gal made in a style we might call funky folkloric . The narratives are ever willing to stop in their circuitous tracks and wait appreciatively for an eccentric character to idle on by . Trouble is , it takes more than divorce papers and edgewise weirdies to inform a good picture these days . <P> Purcell 's debut feature comes out of the bottom of Beth Henley 's script drawer . The author of Crimes of the Heart and ( in collaboration ) True Stories has down-home flakes down pat , but here they are too pat . Meet  --  as if you had n't met them in Southern literature a hundred times before  --  the irrepressible outcast ( Rosanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of Miz Right , the good-ole-girl barmaid ( Mare Winningham ) , the ex-jock with itchy trousers ( Jim Youngs ) . In her eye blink of a role , Winningham is a buoyant delight , and Youngs nicely fleshes out his cardboard stud , but everyone else goes under in a sea of mannerisms . Arquette brings a clangorous winsomeness to the sort of cracked-belle character that the young Katharine Hepburn portrayed so majestically in Morning Glory and Alice Adams . Rosanna grates ; the film galls . If Nobody 's Fool does n't get on your nerves , you do n't have any . <P> Demme ( Melvin and Howard ) is on higher ground and does a snappier dance . E. Max Frye 's script offers a careering trip through the East Coast Nighttown previously explored by Desperately Seeking Susan , After Hours and Blue Velvet . Solid Citizen Jeff Daniels meets Madcap Airhead Melanie Griffith and in a trice is stripped , handcuffed , kidnaped , beaten up and plied with big wet licky kisses . Natch , he goes for it . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " now that you 've seen how the other half lives . . . the other half of you . " Daniels holds together better than the movie , which lurches from romance to farce to terror . Only Ray Liotta , as a crew-cut sadist , blends the laughs and screams with a beguiling creepiness . Something Wild boasts cameo spots by Directors John Sayles and John Waters , as well as a cute turn by the moms of Demme and David Byrne ( who wrote and sings the opening song ) . These badges of hipness stick out like a designer label stitched on an old pair of jeans . The film causes no tremors , only a hemi-Demme-semiquav er.
