Down the road a spit , in the sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles , the generated electricity powers microwaves , lights , air conditioners . The nearly 200 megawatts generated can meet the residential needs of about 270 , 000 people . A planned billion-dollar-plus expansion here by 1994 will triple that output to meet the residential electrical needs of a city the size of Washington. // // Here at Kramer Junction , the largest solar-powered facility ever built generates an estimated 90 percent of the world ' s electricity drawn from the sun . Welcome to the present and future of solar power in both the United States and the world . According to the Solar Energies Industry Association , this 1 , 000-acre facility is the most advanced worldwide effort to bring solar energy into large-scale production. // The solar-thermal technology represented by these rows of mirrors is one of three forms of solar energy production now used : the solar panel , which is mostly used to heat water above or near a house ; photovoltaic cells that use silicon wafers to generate electricity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the Luz technology here. // ' ' What needs to be learned ( about this facility ) is that this project is not a fluke but the beginning of a major trend , ' ' says Scott Sklar , executive director of SEIA , a trade group . ' ' The US will begin seeing these plants multiplying in New Mexico , Arizona , Nevada , Texas , and California. ' ' // ' ' Luz has been the firm that has taken the state-of-the-art technology , pushed it , applied it , taken corporate risks , ' ' adds Robert San Martin , deputy assistant secretary for renewable energy at the Department of Energy . ' ' It is very clear that this is the cutting edge. ' ' // Spurred by anxiety over acid rain and global warming caused in part by burning fossil fuels to produce electric power , at least four major bills are working their way through Congress with measures aimed at harnessing the sun ' s cleaner energy . Among them , the National Energy Policy Act of 1989 calls for relaxation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums for research and development . The bill has 30 cosponsors and broad bipartisan support. // ' ' It ' s time to look once again at renewable , nonpolluting sources of energy , ' ' says Sen. Timothy Wirth ( D ) of Colorado , whose Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held congressional hearings in Los Angeles last month on both the greenhouse effect and the problems of smog in the Los Angeles Basin . To attract attention back to solar , Mr. Wirth trotted out some Hollywood celebrities - Dennis Weaver , Morgan Fairchild , and others - to the Luz site for a live press conference for radio and television stations across the West. // ' ' We ' ve got to keep pushing it . . . to alert the country that real alternatives do exist , ' ' he said. // Low oil prices over the last eight years have meant reduced incentive to develop alternative energy . Department of Energy funding for research and development has dropped from 800 million in 1980 to this year ' s budget request of $81 million , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for photovoltaics has dropped from $150 million in 1981 to $35 million this year. // The Luz company - whose solar power is three times as cost effective as photovoltaics and uses one-fourth of the land - was founded in 1979 in Los Angeles by Arnold Goldman , an American engineer and Patrick Francois , a French financier. // ' ' We felt we ' re buying into the dawn of the solar age , ' ' says Newton Becker , chairman of the board and one of the company ' s largest investors . ' ' Now , despite a huge collapse in the price of oil ( currently between $18 and $20 a barrel ) we still firmly believe it . ' ' Late last year , technological advances in photovoltaic research accompanied announcements by the Chronar Corporation of Princeton , N.J. , to build a 50-megawatt photovoltaic plant near here , but no contract has been signed . The largest photovoltaic plant generates about 6. 5 megawatts. // Whereas initial units generated power at about 24 cents per kilowatt-hour , technological improvements - patented sun sensors , vacuum-insulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As economies of scale , costs could be lowered another 2 cents if plant-size restrictions were lifted - currently mandated by the Public Utilities Regulatory Practices Act in 1978 . Restrictions were written to appease utility companies concerned about competition from alternative sources. // ' ' In a few years , this solar-thermal technology will be absolutely price competitive with any form of energy under any scenario , ' ' says Luz ' s Paul Savodelli . The Luz-type facilities depend on sustained , high-intensity sunlight and are thus suited to location primarily in the US Southwest and similar areas worldwide. // One major attraction of Luz-type facilities , say Mr. Sklar , Mr. San Martin , and others , is that they are modular in nature and have a start-up time of only 18 months . ' ' You can ' t even get approval for a conventional power plant in that amount of time , ' ' says Robert Meyer of the Department of Energy . The modular nature makes them attractive to municipalities with limited funds who want to expand facilities each year. // The Luz International Ltd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant in nearby Dagget . They have since graduated to seven so-called ' ' solar farms ' ' that employ 650 , 000 slightly concave mirrors , heat exchangers , and traditional-style turbine generators . Though the 196 megawatts that are generated represent only 1 percent of Southern California Edison ' s peak demand , all the energy is purchased from Luz by Edison as required by the the 1978 regulatory act. // Impressed with performance , Edison has given Luz five additional 30-year power contracts , according to Pam Easterwood at Edison . The energy has been used mostly during peak and overflow periods . When such power is needed at night , the Luz facility is allowed by law to produce up to 25 percent of its power by natural gas as backup and to sustain performance . That has helped assuage one chronic complaint against solar power - reliability. // Beside the obvious nonpolluting , renewable aspects of solar power , company officials say , the start-up and maintenance costs of Luz systems are far less. // Wirth , Sklar , and others are concerned about the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid- ' 70s that helped buttress Luz ' s early years . They are due to expire this December . According to Luz CEO James Bazor the company will be out $25 million if those investment credits end . Beside tripling capacity here in the next five years , the company is planning similar plants in Nevada , Mexico , Arizona , India , Spain , and Brazil. // ' ' Projects such as Luz are extremely sensitive to increases in interest rates and the price of oil , ' ' adds Mr. Savodelli . ' ' The tax credit gives us that buffer that helps us stay competitive with other forms of energy while we continue to develop the technology. ' ' // //
