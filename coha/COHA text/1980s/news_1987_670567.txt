" I had never played a woman with a job before , " Ellen Barkin said. // The actress , who has made a vivid impression in such roles as Robert Duvall ' s daughter in " Tender Mercies , " as Timothy Hutton ' s wife in " Daniel " and as the young wife in " Diner , " was discussing the appeal of her latest role - Assistant District Attorney Anne Osborne , investigating police corruption in New Orleans in " The Big Easy . " " My job in movies up to this point , " Miss Barkin said , " has basically been to get through the day , and this was the first time I was playing somebody who had a kind of life that was not so much ruled by their emotional state . It was something I ' ve been wanting to do for about a year. " // The Bronx-born Miss Barkin said she was also attracted to the movie ' s sense of humor . " The only time people are encouraged to laugh is when they ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know in life - the people I ' m surrounded with , anyway - are just witty people . They say witty things . You don ' t have to necessarily be in a funny situation when that ' s happening . That was apparent to me reading the script and got bigger as Jim McBride reworked the script. " // Mr. McBride , the film ' s director , worked with Miss Barkin and her co-star , Dennis Quaid , who plays an easygoing police detective , during three weeks of rehearsal that preceded 50 days of shooting that began in October 1985. // " When I got to New Orleans , " said Miss Barkin , noting she had first thought of Anne Osborne stereotypically as straitlaced and prim , " I was introduced to an assistant district attorney named Patricia Head . She broke down all my preconceived notions . She looked like me , as opposed to what I thought she should look like . She was young . She was a triathlete . She was not what I expected . So after meeting her I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this woman to be a real woman as opposed to me turning her into something I wasn ' t . I just put more of myself into her. " // Since " The Big Easy , " Miss Barkin has completed " Siesta , " in which she portrays a daredevil - a female Evel Knievel . She described it as a film about " female obsession , love and death . " And sometime this fall , she hopes to do " Happy All the Time , " written by Julius Epstein of " Casablanca " fame - about an intellectual Jewish woman from New York who comes to an emotional awakening. // Discussing her selection of roles , Miss Barkin said : " I ' m careful in the way in which I choose to depict women in movies - not so much that they ' re working girls or exhibit the new-found independence , because that ' s not usually what I do at all . There are a whole lot of women in the world who don ' t have a lot of people to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Desert Bloom . ' That ' s more important to me than portraying some kind of together woman of the 80 ' s . They don ' t need as much help . " And I also feel when I act in a movie I never want anyone in an audience to look at me on a movie screen and say , ' I wish I were her . ' I like them to look at the movie and say , ' She ' s just like me ' or ' She could be like me . ' That Cosmo girl image is something I ' m not interested in perpetuating. " // Miss Barkin noted : " I don ' t go to work that much . I ' d rather stay home and read a good book than go out and make a bad movie .

At the time , Mr. Irvin was in Vietnam for the British Broadcasting Corporation making a documentary. // " About five years ago , " he said , " I was having breakfast at the New York Deli with Marcia Nasatir , who is the producer , and we were just talking about my background a bit and she discovered I had been a documentary director in Vietnam and had been so shocked by what I saw in Vietnam that I stopped making documentaries. // " She said she had a script called ' Hamburger Hill , ' which no studio wanted to make , and she was interested in my reaction to it . And I picked it up the same day , read it the same day and I think I wept all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' I will do everything and anything in my power to get this film made. ' " // Mr. Irvin said what impressed him about the script , by Jim Carabatsos , who is also a producer of the film , was that " I recognized so many of the characters in the story. // " When I was in Vietnam , what impressed me most was how young the soldiers were . They were mere kids. " // Mr. Irvin said that about the same time Oliver Stone finally won his long struggle to put " Platoon " before the cameras , the money came through to film " Hamburger Hill. " // " All I can say is the film is a labor of love , " Mr. Irvin said . " It was made out of a great sense of compassion for the kids who fought there. " // As for the fact that " Hamburger Hill " is opening after such Vietnam War films as " Platoon " and " Full Metal Jacket , " the director said : " Obviously I like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I didn ' t . On the other hand , when I was at school running 400 meters , I was quite often laughed off the blocks , but I frequently won. " // Next , said the director , " I ' m going to scrape the mud off my boots and put on a new pair of shoes and make a thriller set in Palm Springs in 1948 . It ' s based on a Chandler unfinished novel wherein Philip Marlowe got married - ' The Springs . ' " The role of the detective Marlowe , played by Humphrey Bogart in " The Big Sleep , " has yet to be cast . But Mr. Irvin hopes to begin filming in November. // " I ' m a huge fan of Raymond Chandler ' s , " he said , " and the idea of creating a new Marlowe is too tempting to resist .
