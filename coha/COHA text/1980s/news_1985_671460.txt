Although Paul Taylor once studied painting , he is not a painter on canvas . But Apollinaire ' s words seem to define him admirably . This is especially true in works such as his " Last Look , " a new piece in the Paul Taylor Dance Company ' s current season at the City Center . Literally and metaphorically , the colors here are dark . " Last Look " is one of Mr. Taylor ' s black pieces but , typically , nothing is ever black or white in his domain . The emotional colors he invents even within a so-called limited palette are exactly what make pieces such as " Last Look " so strong - so artistic , if you will. // A lesser choreographer would be content with merely feeding the public information . After all , what Mr. Taylor tells us in " Last Look " is not that startling . The world has gone mad , people ' s psyches are torn apart , uncaring civilizations that care only about themselves are doomed , we are all in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the raft of the Medusa . You don ' t have to read Spengler or see the latest apocalyptic sci-fi movie to get the general idea in " Last Look. " // The specifics are perhaps open to interpretation . But the universals are clear . " Last Look " has the power of an Abstract Expressionist painting and it is , significantly , a dance piece in which the decor ( by Alex Katz ) , the lighting ( by Jennifer Tipton ) and the commissioned score ( by Donald York ) are completely integrated with the choreography . The total effect of " Last Look " is dependent upon all four elements . None could really have the same impact on its own . This perfect fusion brings to mind the celebrated " dark " pieces by Merce Cunningham of the 1960 ' s , " Winterbranch " and " Place . " Angst , despair and violence seemed all over the place there - which might be a surprise to newcomers who are unfamiliar Mr. Cunningham ' s most dramatic works , all now discarded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sound and costumes were unrelated in the Cunningham pieces . The drama resulted from the coming together of these independent elements . The theories were proved several times . A few years ago , Mr. Cunningham included choreography from " Winterbranch " in his " Events " format . One time , all of " Winterbranch " was seen within an " Event , " which also included fragments of other pieces . The point was that " Winterbranch " was not recognizable as such out of context - without the lighting and sound designed for it . The choreography looked like what it was in terms of physical fact - a formal exercise focused on different ways of falling. // There are at least three ways of seeing choreography as a skeletal structure of any dance piece . Any balletgoer will recognize the choreography from the Rose Adagio in Petipa ' s " The Sleeping Beauty , " whether or not it is danced in costume or with or without music . Then there is Mr. Cunningham ' s choreography which seems , except to insiders , mainly recognizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is an example . Movement has no emotional meaning in itself , Mr. Cunningham ' s works attempt to tell us . It is our perception that gives them a distinct " meaning. " // A middle ground is struck by Mr. Taylor in " Last Look , " where the elements are meant to coalesce in an image of a doomed society . Yet the choreography here , too , is a formal experiment . If we saw it in daylight without the three-sided mirrored screens that Mr. Katz has set up as mournful skyscraper-tombstones , we might think the dancers throwing themselves about so vigorously were immersed in some rite of spring at Fort Lauderdale. // Instead , " Last Look " is a study in desperation . Like Mr. Cunningham , albeit with a different objective , Mr. Taylor here uses movement that might not mean something specifically emotional on its own terms . Under the theatrical trappings , the choreography is designed as an experiment - reportedly based on just eight basic movement phrases . These are used in different ways , rhythmically and in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which David Parsons and Susan McGuire try out a half remembered attempt at sexual communication ) seems to include movement that others do not use. // You don ' t have to be privy to inside information to realize that Mr. Taylor ' s range is deliberately restricted here . The emphasis is on blasts of raw energy , on key motor motifs that are equated with verbs such as writhe , slither , dive , whirl , quiver , toss and leap. // Dramatically , the piece has a hidden episodic structure . A mound of bodies comes apart . From this human junk heap , the survivors move out to engage in a literal last fling - throwing themselves to the floor or against the mirrored slabs onstage . At the end , they re-form the heap of bodies , seeking communal comfort and communal extinction. // The decor , too , poses a formal problem . From where I sat , I saw four mirrored slabs in a diagonal plus a similar , smaller , structure toward the front of the stage . After a second viewing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he replied , " seven or eight . " Allowing for Mr. Katz ' s wry wit ( not knowing if it was seven **28;1681; or <> eight ) , the point is that someone who sees five does not see all of the seven or eight - that is , the spectators in different parts of the theater do not see the same thing. // " Private Domain , " the Taylor-Katz masterpiece revived this season , plays consistently on this device . There , the dancers are partially hidden or revealed through a series of portals in front of them . In " Last Look , " Mr. Katz ' s structures serve as conventional stage wings , placed at an angle . They do not serve as obstacles . Mr. Katz said , in fact , that the audience was meant to see reflections of the dancers on the mirrors when the dancers themselves were not visible to us . This was not obvious to me . I saw the reflections only when I also saw the dancers in front of the mirrored surface. // Nonethless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has costumed the women ( Miss McGuire , Linda Kent , Raegan Wood , Sandra Stone , Mary Cochran ) in pink , orange , yellow or chartreuse dresses that split open at the skirt level . They wear jewelry as a reminder of happier times . The men ( Mr. Parsons , Kenneth Tosti , Christopher Gillis , James Karr ) wear mechanic-green pants and shirts . They are humans tearing themselves apart . When the dancers hurl themselve against the mirrors , they look deep into themselves . One , Miss Stone , is restrained by the others. // Amid the well-orchestrated confusion , individualized dances emerge - for Mr. Gillis , Miss Kent , Mr. Tosti , Miss Wood ( dangerously tossed around ) , Miss Stone . Miss Wood and Mr. Tosti perform a dance of death to an echo from Ravel ' s " Valse . " Mr. York ' s score sounded more textured in its drama on second hearing , quite apt for a study in disintegration . At the end , Miss Kent tries to be part of the re-formed heap of bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In 1963 , Mr. Taylor and Mr. Katz created a wonderful piece , " Scudorama , " a beach party for lost souls . A program note quoted Dante : " What souls are these who run through this black haze. . . . " // " Last Look " is a lineal descendant of " Scudorama , " even in some of its movement . But the " colors " are different . " Scudorama " was more dreamlike . Its predatory images were surrealistic . " Last Look " is typical of the recent dramatic works by Mr. Katz and Mr. Taylor - they use abstract form to create a stunning new realism. //
