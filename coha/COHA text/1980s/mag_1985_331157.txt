The secretary 's reply is all too familiar : " I 'm sorry , he 's in a meeting . " No wonder . A survey commissioned by Corporate Headhunter Robert Half shows that the average executive spends 16 1/2 hours a week , or 21 of his 40-hour workweeks a year , in meetings . Thus an executive with a salary of $45,000 earns $18,559 a year just for sitting in meetings . Moreover , nearly one-third of those gatherings , or six weeks ' worth of each executive 's working year , are considered unnecessary by the people attending them . <P> The survey , conducted by Cincinnati-based Burke Marketing Research , showed that the biggest time wasters are regularly held affairs . Says Half : " A lot of companies schedule a meeting every Wednesday at 8:30 , for instance . They may not need one every week , or they may need one every day . But it does n't make sense to hold regular meetings with no agenda . " Alas , little hope is in sight . Laments Half : " America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings . The problem is , how do you export meetings ? " There will be a meeting next Thursday at 8:30 a.m. to discuss that subject .
