Stepping somberly to the podium in a blue-carpeted Washington briefing room last week , Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige confirmed what many businessmen already knew through painful experience . The pace of U.S. economic growth , Baldrige revealed , took a sharp downturn in the second quarter , as American manufacturers continued to be hurt by a high level of imports . After expanding at a 3.8% annual rate from January to March , the gross national product increased at only a 1.1% pace between April and June , the slowest climb since the recession year of 1982 . <P> Baldrige emphasized that the latest growth figures were only a preliminary estimate and that the economy was bound to improve " in the near future . " But outside the Reagan Administration , some of Washington 's policymakers were less confident . Fretted Republican Jake Garn of Utah , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee : " There 's more than the normal level of uncertainty in the economy . " Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker warned that the current expansion is in " growing jeopardy " unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record $148.5 billion last year . <P> The anemic growth rate put added pressure on Congress as it debated two initiatives that may have a profound impact on the economy : a sweeping reform of the tax system and a plan to reduce the $200 billion-plus federal budget deficit . Some lawmakers fear that tax reform , which may hike Government revenues in the short run , when combined with a federal spending cut could deaden an already weak economy . Said Representative Jack Brooks , a Texas Democrat : " We could be staring a raging recession right in the face . " <P> That view is probably alarmist . Though some economists have begun to talk about the possibility of a recession , most experts expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year . They think that the 65% drop in oil prices since late last year , which has devastated the huge U.S. petroleum industry , will soon begin to stimulate investment by other businesses and increased spending by consumers . The fall in the value of the dollar , a 26% decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help reduce the trade deficit by making imports more expensive and American goods cheaper abroad . A turnaround in trade has been surprisingly slow in coming , but economists point out that changes in currency values usually affect trading patterns only after a long lag . <P> Whatever the outlook , no one can deny that the U.S. economy is wheezing at the moment . Industrial production , which grew slowly last year , began to shrink in the second quarter of 1986 ( see chart ) . One main cause of the malaise seems to be companies ' reluctance to invest in new plants and equipment . Says Stephen Roach , an economist with the Morgan Stanley investment firm : " Capital spending is in the worst shape for any postwar expansion period . " Roach projects that capital investment for all of 1986 will fall by 4.5% , compared with last year . Says he : " Every time such a contraction has taken place , the economy has been either on the brink or in the midst of outright recession . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
