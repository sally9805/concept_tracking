Kenneth Fisher never thought it would take this long to return to the spotlight when he named his new company Encore . After years of struggling in computerdom ' s equivalent of off-off-Broadway , Mr. Fisher , 58 years old , figures that with the just-completed acquisition of much larger Gould/Computer Systems Inc. , he is finally getting the opportunity , snatched from him eight years ago , to develop a billion-dollar company . The long-shot acquisition increases Encore Computer Corp. ' s sales sixfold , gives it a big presence in Europe , quintuples its sales force to 165 people , and provides world-wide repair facilities . " It makes my mouth drool . It ' s a wonderful prospect , " says Mr. Fisher . Perennially upbeat and strong-willed yet soft-spoken , Mr. Fisher cut his teeth as an executive in General Electric Co. ' s problem-prone computer operation . When GE gave up and sold the operation to Honeywell Inc . , Mr. Fisher went with it . In 1975 a group of Honeywell expatriates invited him to manage their struggling startup company , Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wall Street , doubling earnings yearly and one year increasing value faster than any other New York Stock Exchange stock . But corporate directors pushed Mr. Fisher out of his job as president and chief executive officer in 1981 . At the time Prime wouldn ' t comment , but later , Chairman David Dunn criticized what he said were weak planning and financial controls by Mr. Fisher . Two years later Mr. Fisher and two other high-tech luminaries started Encore to develop an innovative , high-performance computer , raising $47 million in venture capital and an initial public offering before the company even shipped its product . But development delays and management disputes conspired almost to kill the Marlborough , Mass. , company . In 1987 , Mr. Fisher put in an additional $3 million of his own money to keep it alive . After its struggles , Encore became a barely profitable also-ran in the computer business . In the year ended Oct. 29 , it earned $1. 9 million , or eight cents a share , on sales of $34. 4 million .

Gould , which last year had sales of about $220 million , was for sale because of special circumstances , but Mr. Fisher says he had tried to buy it before . " This was no spur-of-the-moment thing , " he says . Nippon Mining Co. acquired Gould Inc. last year for $1 billion . The Japanese metals company wanted Gould ' s copper foil business , a major element in making printed circuit boards . Gould also makes test and measurement equipment and fuses . Nippon had planned to sell off the computer business because much of it is defense related , and the Defense Department dislikes buying key technologies from foreign-owned concerns . Electronic News , a trade publication , reported that Motorola Inc . , International Business Machines Corp . , Harris Corp. and Concurrent Computer Corp. all studied the operation but walked away . Strapped for cash , Mr. Fisher couldn ' t bid against such heavy hitters , but when they dropped out , he negotiated an agreement under which Nippon provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s purchase of the unit . In addition , Nippon got a stake of about one-third of Encore . " I think he pulled a pretty crafty deal , " said Bruce Watts , an investment banker with Needham &; Co. in Boston who has known Mr. Fisher for years . He adds that even if Mr. Fisher can ' t arrange long-term financing at favorable rates , " What ' s Nippon going to do ? Take it back ? " Mr. Fisher says he expects to announce financing soon . Charles Casale , president of Aberdeen Group Inc. , a Boston market research firm , said he thinks combining the companies will cause " two quarters of real choppiness in assimilation " of disparate product lines and markets . " By the fourth quarter I think they ' ll be operating at a profitable level , " with annual sales of $250 million to $300 million , he says . On the surface , the two companies look like misfits .

In addition it has spent $100 million developing a very fast mini-supercomputer for scientific and engineering use , that has sold slowly . Encore makes a different type of fast computer that links between two and 20 microprocessors together to achieve high speed . Although Mr. Fisher thinks it will compete in the commercial computer marketplace with computers from Digital Equipment Corp. and IBM , most sales have been to engineers and the government . Mr. Fisher says that Gould ' s San Diego-based mini-supercomputer operation was late to market and has " probably been passed by . " Analysts expect him to close it down promptly and try to persuade customers to switch to Encore ' s MultiMax systems . Mr. Fisher also plans to teach Gould ' s big sales and service staffs to handle Encore ' s computers . " Small companies are salesmen-limited rather than market limited , " says Mr. Casale of Aberdeen Group . " This deal takes a company with a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says .
