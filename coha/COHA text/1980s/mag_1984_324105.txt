To cut the aftertax cost of illicit sex in Chicago 's suburbs , a firm called National Credit Service offered businessmen phony invoices that they could use to claim false tax deductions , as well as the privilege of credit-card payment . Lucrative though its business was , the firm closed up shop last week with the announcement that it had been an FBI sting .
