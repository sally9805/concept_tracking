HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 141parfleche , a hide bag decorated with quills and painted designs . From the bag he took a roll of clean , soft animal skin , which he spread by the fire . Next he opened small pots of red and black paint he moistened with spit . He surprised Charles by producing an artist 's small brush . With strokes of black he began painting at the upper left corner of the skin . A line of three stick-figure horses and riders . He finished with a smaller four-footed figure out in front . " What in thunder 's that ? " Charles asked . " The start of our winter count . Kind of a picture history of a season in a man 's life . Chiefs and braves make ' em . " He grinned . " I figure the Jackson Trading Company 's important enough to have one this year . " They saw a buffalo herd in seasonal migration southward .

" One name the tribes got for the buff la is Uncle . Since he provides pretty near everything they eat or use , they figure he 's pretty near a relative . " Under an ugly gray sky streaked silver by lightning , Charles held on to his hat and squinted through blowing dust at eight young Indians armed with lances and rifles . They were within hailing distance , so Charles clearly heard them yell , " Sons of bitches . Sons of bitches ! " One brave knelt on his pony 's back , thrust out his rear end , and thumbed it with his right hand . Wooden Foot sighed . " They 's sure learned all the best we got to teach . " Boy crowded his horse close to his uncle 's . Charles rested the Spencer on his right leg , his mouth dry with worry . The lightning streaked east to west , and distant thunder pealed . Behindthe braves milled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foals . The white men had stopped when they spied the Indiansherding the ponies across some low hills . " That 's money on the hoof , them horses , " Wooden Foot said . " Tribal wealth . They wo n't risk losin ' it by comin ' after us . They seldom attack ' less they outnumber the other side or they 's trapped or provoked . ' Sides , they 's near enough to see we got these . " He pumped his rifle up and down over his head a few times . The braves replied with more shaken fists and obscenities . As the wind strengthened and the rain started , they rode away with their herd . It took about ten minutes for Charles to calm down . In wartime combat , he 'd never been free of fear , but it seemed sharper and more personal out here . Probably because of the space . All the empty , lonely , beautiful space . " Dive , Charlie ! " Wooden Foot yelled . " Dive and shoot ! " His feet out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a second , falling between the saddle and the grass as Satan galloped , he was sure he 'd break his neck . He did n't . While his legs locked on belly and loin , he shot his left hand under the piebald 's neck and hooked it over . Clingingto the piebald 's left side in that way , and protected by the horse 's body , he tried to forget the prairie flying by beneath him . " Shoot ! " his teacher bellowed . He pulled himself up far enough to snap off a round above the withers of the racing horse . Wooden Foot yelled his approval . " Again ! " After five shots , his arm gave out and he fell off , rememberingat the last moment to relax before he hit . The impact left him gasping , half senseless . Fen ran circles around him , barking . Boy jigged and clapped for him . Wooden Foot pulled him up , slapping his back to help him breathe . " Good , Charlie . Better'n good . Damn fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A real gift , God 's truth . " " You think it 's important I know how to shoot from behind my horse ? " Charles asked with some skepticism . Wooden Foot shrugged . " The more you know , the better chance you got to save your hair if some wild Cheyenne wants it . They use that little trick in tiltin ' . That 's a game on horseback , with padded lances . They try to knock each other off . Somebody musta figured out that it 's a lot safer shootin ' that way , too . How you feel ? " Satan trotted back , dipped his head , and blubbered out breath . Dust-covered , Charles smiled . " Bumped up a good deal . Otherwise I 'm fine . " " Good . I think we should try it again . I mean , you did fall off ? " That night , Wooden Foot added a pictograph to the winter count . The stick figure represented Charles shooting while hang-142 HEAVEN AND HELL ing on the side of his running horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed him the finished picture . For the first time in weeks , he slept without dreams of any kind . They rode on south , still pupil and teacher . " This yere says Cheyenne . " Wooden Foot drew his right index finger rapidly across his left one several times . " What it really says is striped arrow , but it means Cheyenne ' cause they use striped turkey feathers for fletchin ' . " Charles imitated the sign a few times . Wooden Foot then clenched his hand , extending index and little fingers . " Horse . " And the hands with fingertips touching , an inverted V. " Tipi . " And a fist at either temple , index fingers raised . " You can guess this one . " " Buffalo ? " " Good , good . Only a thousand more to learn , give or take a few . " The lessons covered various subjects . Wooden Foot rode his horse down a slight slope , back and forth , a continuous Z pat- tern . " If an Indian 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this says you 're peaceful . " And , as they watched another wild pony herd stream along the horizon to the southeast : " Thing you got to do out here , Charlie , is turn your notions upside down . White man 's rules and ways , they do n't operate . F'rinstance , steal a horse back in Topeka , they 'll hang you . Out here , runnin ' off ten or twenty head from another bunch of lodges is the very bravest of deeds . If we 'd learn to parley on Indian terms ' stead of our own , there might be real peace on the plains . " And , kneeling by some tracks in the steel-colored morning : " What would you read from this , Charlie ? " He studied the marks , a number of nearly identical sets over- lapping and partially obliterating each other . He glanced at Fen , panting from pulling the travois , then at the flat and empty land . " Travois . A whole lot of them , according to those pole tracks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s'posed to think . But look back two miles , to where these tracks started . You wo n't see any dog drop- pin 's . Just horse turds . No dogs , no village . A few braves made these , with stone-weighted poles tied to their waists . In a few blinks of an eye , they can conjure up a village big enough to scare you off . Old fear 's a powerful medicine . It can trick you into seein ' what you expect to be there , ' stead of what is . Look . " He stood in the stirrups to point , his other hand holding his hat in the keen wind . On a rise to the southeast , so far away the figures were miniature , Charles saw horsemen . Four of them . " There 's your whole village . If you just saw the tracks , you 'd ride real wide of it , would n't you ? " Charles felt stupid and showed it . Wooden Foot slapped his shoulder , to say it was all part of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sound boomed away toward the distant riders , who quickly trotted out of sight . Like the other lessons , it burned into Charles 's head with the permanence of a white-hot iron . Old fear 's a powerful medicine . It can trick you into seein ' what you expect to be there , ' stead of what is . Over the fire that night , while adding the incident to the winter count with strokes of black and red , Wooden Foot said in a mild voice , " You forgettin ' about her some ? The one you lost , I mean ? " " Some . " These days he occasionally thought of Willa , too . " I 'm grateful to you . " Wooden Foot waved the dainty brush . " All in the job . If I wanted a partner worth the name , I knew I had to pull you out of the glooms . They 's just too damn many interestin ' things and too many kinds of possible trouble out here for a man to stay sunk in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to keep his hair . " " I believe you , " Charles said . He leaned back on his elbows , warmed by the fire and friendship , feeling a new , if fragile , contentment . He was beginning to feel the same kind of affection for this part of the world that he 'd felt for Texas . About an hour before dawn , a familiar pressure woke him . Too damn much coffee again . As quietly as he could , he rolled out of his buffalo robe . His breath plumed in the dim light from the embers in the center of the tipi floor . He untied the flap thongs and slipped out the round hole without making a noise . He heard the horses and mules fretting on their picket line144 HEAVEN AND HELLand wondered why . The cold , star-bright night seemed untroubled . One thing sure , if some kind of animal interloper was prowling , Fen would never announce it . He was everything except a watchdog . Charles walked along the side of a draw , away from the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then his long underwear . Over the stream of water , he heard a voice . He cut off the water , jerked his clothes back in place , and reached automatically to his hip . The holstered Colt was n't there . He slept with it next to his head . He had his Bowie in its belt sheath , though . He crept back through the draw and saw silhouettes cast by the fire onto the tipi cover . Two people sitting up , a third standingbetween them with something stubby in his hand . A gun . Licking his chapped mouth and furiously blinking sleep away , Charles crept toward the tipi . The intruder , who must have stolen into the tipi right after he left , and not seen him , was speaking to Boy . " You lie still , you barrel-headed idiot . If you do n't , I 'll blow this old fool 's brainpan to pieces . " The shadow man jammed the shadow gun against Wooden Foot 's shadow head to demonstrate . " You fucking old geezer , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . " " Little early in the season for snowbirds , ai n't it ? " Wooden Foot remarked . Charles suspected he was n't as calm as he sounded . " I thought fellas like you ate Army food all winter , then lit out in the spring . " " Shut the fuck up , unless you want me to shoot that pruneeyedcretin . " Very quietly , Wooden Foot said , " No , I do n't want you to do that . " " Then fetch me the goods . " " They 're in travel bags . Outside . " The man pushed the muzzle of the gun into Wooden Foot 's shoulder . " Let 's go . " 14Charles drew his Bowie from its sheath . His heart raced as he started for the tipi . Long strides brought him near the round hole a few seconds before Wooden Foot crawled out . The trader sensed Charles close by , standing against the tipi , but did n't turn his head to give it away . He was followed by the man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearded face , then sleeves with yellow corporal 's stripes . A deserter , all right . " Hold it there , old man , " the man said , straightening . He was stocky and a head shorter than Wooden Foot , who was n't all that tall . God knew from which fort he 'd bolted . Maybe Lamed , or the newer one , Fort Dodge . Charles shifted his weight for the strike . About to speak , the deserter heard or sensed something . He pivoted , saw Charles , fired . The ball scorched past Charles 's cheek and tore through the tipi cover . Charles rammed the knife into the deserter 's blue blouse and turned it , skewering him . " Oh , no , " the soldier said , rising on tiptoe . " No . " A second later , he was unconscious on his feet . His hand opened , and the gun dropped . His knees unlocked , and Charles supposed he was dead , or nearly so , as he sprawled on the moonlit ground , bonelessas a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charles wiped his knife on the grass . " What do we do with him ? " Wooden Foot was puffing as though he 'd run a long way . " Leave him " ? more gasps ? " for the scavengers . He do n't deserveno better . " Fen trotted from the dark , whining ; he knew something was146 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 147wrong . Wooden Foot patted him . " That was slick work with the knife , Charlie . You 're learnin ' fast . " He grabbed the blue uniform collar , raising the dead man 's head . Moonlight on the lifeless eyes made them shine like coins . " Or did you already know how to do that sort of thing ? " Charles finished cleaning the knife with a wad of dead grass . He shot the Bowie back in the sheath and tapped the handle with his palm . The handle hit the sheath with a soft but distinct click . That was answer enough . In the tipi , Boy crouched with his arms crossed . Hugging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles understood why the youngster reacted that way . It was n't merely fright . His poor short-weighted mind sometimes understood that his uncle faced a hard task or a rough situation . He always wanted to help but could n't send the right orders to his hands or feet or any other part of his body . Twice before , Charles had seen him weep in angry frustration . Wooden Foot took Boy in his arms . He patted and comfortedhim . Then he plucked at the front of his own shirt . Charles again noticed the deep red of the trader 's face . Wooden Foot saw him staring . " I told you , it ai n't anythin ' , " he said , almost as angry as his nephew . Charles did n't pursue it . In early November , the Jackson Trading Company crossed trails with a half-dozen Arapahoes moving north . All wore their hair heavily dressed with grease , but one , more sensitive than the others to the recent summer sunshine , had hair more goldenbrownthan black . The scalp showing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wooden Foot talked with the Arapahoes in a combination of sign , rudimentary English , and their own tongue . Charles heard " Moketavato " a few times ; he recognized the Cheyenne name of Black Kettle , the peace chief Wooden Foot admired and respected . He needed no special understanding of Indians to recognize the animosity of the Arapahoes . It snapped in every syllable , every sharp gesture and fiery look . Still , they kept talking with Wooden Foot , squatting in a semicircle opposite him , for almost an hour . " I do n't understand , " Charles said after the Arapahoes had ridden away . " They hated the sight of us . " " Sure , they did . " " But they talked to you . " " Well , we had n't done nothin ' to stir ' em up , so they was duty-bound to treat us in a civil manner . Most Indians are like that . Not all , though , so do n't be lulled . " " You talked to them about Black Kettle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief Little Raven touched the pen to that treaty on the Little Arkansasnot two weeks ago . The treaty stakes out a new reservation , gives a parcel of land on it to every Cheyenne or Arapahoe who 's willin ' to live there , and sweetens it to a hundred sixty acres if somebody lost a parent or a husband at Sand Creek . The guv'mint came down hard on what happened there , and they 's sendin ' Bill Bent , a good man , into the villages this winter to see that the sojers do n't do the same thing again . Only trouble is , they was only about eighty Cheyenne lodges at the Little Arkansas . They 's some two hundred others roamin ' loose , and to them the treaty 'll be just so much spit in the wind . " Charles scratched his chin ; lengthening stubble was turning into a beard . " Did you find out where Black Kettle 's camped ? " " Straight ahead , on the Cimarron . Right where I meant to look for him . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wooden Foot pointed to littered bones . " Buffla jump . They turn the herd and run it over the edge . Pretty soon the buffla are pilin ' up and breakin ' legs and generally makin ' it easy for the braves to kill ' em . " Two days had passed since their meeting with the Arapahoes . Light snowflakes fell in the windless afternoon , meltingas they touched the frost-killed grass . Charles relished the warmth of his cigar and wondered how his son would react to his first sight of a snowfall . He surely wished he could be there to see " Jumpin ' the herd that way ai n't quite as glorious as killin ' buffla in a reg'lar hunt . But if winter 's closin ' in and there ai n't enough carcasses put by yet , it 's a good quick way to ? " He broke off , turned his head . " Hold on . " He ran out of the jump and up to the rim . There he knelt , palms pressed to the ground . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELL A Winter Count 149 " Riders . Comin ' fast . Damn . They 's two dozen or more . I got a hunch we used up all our good luck on that thievin ' snowbird , Charlie . " Charles ran for Satan , jerking his Spencer from the saddle scabbard . Wooden Foot ordered him to put it away . " Why ? " " ' Cause we need to see who they are . You want to guarantee you 'll be kilt , shoot an Indian without tryin ' to palaver first . " Wooden Foot walked along the lip of the jump , thumbs in his cartridge belt , his slow slouching gait indicating a lack of worry . Charles saw plenty in his eyes , though . He slid the Spencerback and joined his partner . Wooden Foot motioned Boy to his side as bareback riders in a wide concave line came galloping down on them . The Indians wore fringed leggings . Some had scarlet blanketstied around their waists . Six wore huge bonnets of eagle feathers . Charles also noted , not happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jackets with the light blue facingsof the infantry , the third an old-style tail coat faced with artillery red . The wearer of the tail coat displayed a couple of medals on the front . Another Indian , a sleek , thin , notably darker man in his mid-twenties , wore a huge silver cross on a chain around his neck . Strands of some wispy material hung from the sleeves and front of his buckskin coat . Almost all of these decorative strands were black , though Charles did notice a few yellow and gray ones . He assumed the cross , like the Army coats , was stolen . " Oh , God , Cheyennes , " Wooden Foot muttered . " And Dog Society men on top of it . They ai n't wearin ' their regalia , but I recognize the one in front . This could n't be worse . " " Who is ? ? " The rest of the question about the leader went unheard as the Cheyennes reined in , setting the air ajingle with the small round bells braided into the manes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as were the trade carbines they leveled at the Jackson Trading Company . Besides the guns , the Indians carried bows and arrows . Fen pulled back and forth in his travois harness , growling . Charles bit down on his cigar , now reduced to a stub by rapid puffing . Boy hid behind his uncle . The darkest Indian , the one wearing the cross , sawed the airand yelled at them in his own tongue . He had a fine , narrow face , though unusually severe . The red paint with which he and the others had decorated their faces and hands was applied to his left cheek with special care . Two broad parallel strokes bracketed a long white scar curving from the outer tip of his eyebrow down along the line of his jaw , where it took a short upward turn beneath the left corner of his mout  --  red-lined fishhook . The snow fell faster . The Cheyennes eyed Charles and his partner while the leader continued his harangue . Charles understoodan occasional word or sign ; Wooden Foot 's teaching was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know any Cheyenne or sign language to understand that almost all of the leader 's remarkswere angry and nasty . Persistently , never raising his voice , Wooden Foot kept replyingevery few seconds . The leader talked at the same time . Charles heard his partner speak of Black Kettle again . The young leader shook his head . He and his friends laughed . Wooden Foot sighed . His shoulders slumped . He held up his right hand , asking for a respite . Grinning all the more , the leader yelped something Charles took to be assent . " Charlie , come on . " The trader drew him along the lip of the bluff . Carbine muzzles swung to follow them . Wooden Foot looked as depressed as Charles had ever seen him . " It do n't do much good to say it now , but I was wrong . We should n't of talked first . These boys are out for blood . " " I thought they did n't attack unless somebody provoked them . " " They 's always the exception . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of this bunch . " Eyeing the dark Indian unhappily , he went on , " He 's a war chief , and a mighty young one at that . His name 's Man-Ready-for-War . Whites call him Scar . Chivington 's men , they killed his ma at Sand Creek . They cut off her hair . I mean all her hair . " Back turned to the Indians , he tapped his groin . " Then they hung it out together with a lot of scalps at that Denver theater where Chivington showed off his trophies . Du n no how Scar heard about i  --  aybe third or fourth hand . They 's a number of tame old Indians hangin ' around Denverbeggin ' or stealin ' to live . But I know for a fact he did hear about his mama 's shame , and he wo n't forgive or forget that . I guess I would n't either . Understandin ' his reasons do n't help us much , though . " 150 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 151 " What about the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? I told you the treaty chiefs signed for only eighty lodges . " " He did a lot of talking . What does he want ? " " Scar and his friends are gon na take us into the village . Then they 'll decide what to do with us . " " Should n't that be all right ? Is n't it Black Kettle 's village ? " Bleakly , Wooden Foot said , " It is , but he ai n't come back from the treaty ground yet . He 's overdue . Till he gets here , Scar speaks loud . In one way , he 's a lot like white folks lookin ' at Indians . Ca n't tell friend from foe , but in his case he do n't want to , either . " Charles felt chillier than the falling snow . " What do we do ? Grab our guns ? " Wooden Foot turned slightly , enabling him to see his nephew . Boy had his arms wrapped over his chest , clutching ; his eyes were huge . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all over at the village , too , but I think I 'd rather go there ' fore we dig our heels in . Boy ca n't defend himself ' gainst a bunch like this . Maybe some of the women 'd take pity on him . Keep the men from carvin ' him up . " He sighed . " Ai n't really fair that I ask you to string this out with me . But that 's what I 'm doin ' . " Charles finished the cigar stub and flipped it down on the buffalo bones . The cigar had tasted more savory than usual . He decided it was because it might be the last he 'd ever smoke . " You know I 'll go along with you . " " All right . Thanks . " With the trader leading , they walked back to the Cheyennes . Rapidly , Wooden Foot conveyed the decision to accompany the Indians without a fight . The braves smiled , and Scar yipped like a dog , which set Fen dancing in his harness . Scar reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-foot stick wrapped in red-dyed buckskin decorated with quills . Painted eyes ornamented one end , eagle feathers the other . Dewclaws taken from some animal turned the stick into a rattle , which Scar brandishedas he jumped from his pony . He darted forward , shaking the rattle . Before Charles could sidestep , Scar slashed the rattle against his cheek . Charles swore and brought his fists up . Wooden Foot held him back . " Do n't , Charlie . I said do n't . He just counted a coup , a little harder than he ought . " Charles knew about counting a coup by touching a vanquishedenemy . It enhanced an Indian 's reputation . But again , understanding how things worked did n't help their situation , or lessen his fear . The dark-eyed Indian threw his head back and yipped and barked . Some of the others took up the cry , driving Fen into a frenzy of jumping and barking . One of the Cheyennes aimed his trade carbine at the dog . Wooden Foot grabbed Fen by the scruff and held him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . Charles stood rigid , scared and angry at the same time . Boy nuzzled against his side , trying to hide his sad misshapen head in the folds of the gypsy robe . Three of the Cheyennes dismounted and dashed among the pack animals , knifing open the canvas parcels . One Indian crowed over a bunch of porcupine quills . He cut the binding thong and tossed the quills in the air . Another stabbed into a bag that spilled a diamond waterfall of pony beads . The Indian cupped his hands beneath , filled both , and ran among his friends , distributing some to each . Wooden Foot restrained Fen , clenched his teeth , and said " God damn , " over and over . Scar strutted to the trader and smacked his shoulder with the snake rattle ; another coup . He barked louder than ever . The snow accumulated on Charles 's hat brim and shoulders and melted in his eyebrows while a strange sense of finality dropped over him . He 'd felt something similar on the eve of battle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " Guess you 're pretty damn sorry you listened to me , " Wooden Foot muttered . " What do you mean ? " " Well , I kept sayin ' they was exceptions to everything , only I guess I did n't learn the lesson good enough myself . I 'm some teacher . " With more cheer than he felt , Charles said , " Any teacher can make a mistake . " " Yep , but in this case even one 's too many . I 'm sorry , Charlie . I sure-God hope we do n't travel the Hangin ' Road ' fore this day 's over . " 152 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 153EXECUTION OF WIRZClosing Scenes in the Life of theAndersonville Jailor .

The exile traveled down from Pennsylvania to Washington , craggy and cynical and confident as ever despite his wartime misfortunes . Simon Cameron , who had brokered his votes at the 1860 Republican convention in exchange for a cabinet post , was one of those ambitious , ice-hearted rascals who did n't understand the word defeat . As Secretary of War , he had caused a scandal with his favoritism in handling supply contracts . Lincoln had got rid of him by exiling him to the post of foreign minister to the court of Russia , and the House of Representatives had censured him for corrupt practices . Yet by 1863 he was back , trying to secure a Senate seat from his home state. 154 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 155He failed , withdrew to Pennsylvania , and proceeded to strengthen his hold on the state machine . I will not be kept out of the national government forever , he wrote to his pupil and campaigncontributor Stanley Hazard , when announcing his current visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which he had recently been admitted through friendship with Senator Ben Wade and some other high-ranking Republicans . In the club 's lavish second-floor rooms , teacher and pupil settled into deep chairs near a marble bust of Socrates . Elderly black men , instructed to be servile , waited on members . One such took Stanley 's order and tiptoed away . Immediately , Cameron asked for a donation . Stanley had expected it . He responded with a pledge of anothertwenty thousand dollars . Lacking talent , he had to buy friendship and advancement . Though it was only half past eleven in the morning , Stanley looked puffy about the eyes and dazed . " Feeling faint , " he explained . Cameron said nothing . " How do you find your work with the Freedmen 's Bureau ? " " Revolting . Oliver Howard ca n't forget he 's a soldier .

And obedience was necessary for him , since he did n't have a single original idea about the political process . Still , granting those limits , he found Cameron 's suggestion exhilarating . The stooped black waiter brought their drinks . Stanley 's glass contained twice the amount in Cameron 's . While his imaginationwas still soaring , the Boss dashed him down . " You know , my boy , you 'd have a sterling future were it not for one liability . " " You must mean George . " " Oh , no . Your brother 's harmless .

He exaggerated'his sigh . " Boss , I 'm sorry , I do n't think what you describe will ever hap- pen . However , if by some chance it does , I 'll notify you at once . " " I wish you would . Good and loyal party men are hard to find . Women , on the other hand , are available anywhere . Think about it , " he murmured , and sipped his drink . After Cameron left , Stanley could hardly contain his excite- ment . The Boss had opened a door , and he wanted to leap through . How could he do it ? He refused an invitation to dine with a fellow club member and ate alone , stuffing down huge forkfuls of food , liquefied with great gulps of champagne . As the dessert course arrive  --  whole quarter of a blueberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . He saw a foolproof way to strike at Isabel behind her back , and insure her eventual downfall . At the same time , the solution would remove him from a situation that , although profitable , bred great anxiety when he considered the possibility of exposure . He could continue collect- ing his profits for another year , perhaps two . Then , at a time entirely of his choosing " Magnificent , " he said , and he did n't mean the champagne or the pie . Before he left the Concourse Club , he set the plan in motion . He was astonished by its simplicity , and pleased by his own inge- nuity in devising it . Perhaps he 'd sold himself short for too long . Perhaps he was n't the idiot that George and Billy and Virgilia and axe-faced Isabel thought he was . He handed a sealed note to the elderly white man at the club 's entrance desk . " Please put this in his pigeonhole so that he gets it next time he stops by . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , not at all , " Stanley said with an airy wave of his cane . The doorkeeper read the envelope as Stanley went down the stairs whistling . Mr. J. Dills , Esq . He slipped it into the proper slot , thinking that for the last year or two , he had not seen Mr. Stanley Hazard so high-spirited or so sober in the middle of the day . A curt letter from the Palmetto Bank . Leverett D. says his board will allow a late payment this once , but not again . In his salutation he addressed me as " Mrs. Main , " rather than by my given name , as in the past . I am sure it is the school issue . We are indeed on the eve of winter . . . A Winter Count 15915The sergeant from Fort Marcy left at midnight . Ashton touched the mussed bed . Still warm . Disgust wrenched her face , then grief .

Then , after she blew out the candle , she spoke to Tillet Main , something she had n't done since visiting his grave a long time ago . I wanted to make you proud of me , Papa .

" Close that blasted window , girl . Old wreck like me gets the chilblains this time of year . " He put down a battered sample case with brass corners . " Sure hope you 're warmblooded . I want to snuggle up and enjoy a cozy night 's sleep . " Lord , what a disgusting specimen , Ashton thought . Age sixty if he was a day . Bland blue eyes , gray hair hanging every which way over his ears and neck , not more than a hundred twenty pounds soaked . At least he looked clea  --  er only consolation . Toss , pop , snap , the old man doffed his shabby frock coat , dragged down his galluses , removed pants and shoes . He opened the sample case , revealing a pile of printed sheets , each with an engraving of a fat woman seated at a grand piano . Rummaging among the handbills and items of soiled linen , he found a whiskey bottle . " For my damn rheumatism . " As he sat on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm too old for this traveling all over hell . " He swigged whiskey . Putting on her best professional smile , Ashton said , " What 's your name , lover ? " " Willard P. Fenway . Call me Will . " She dimpled . " That 's cute . Are you all hot and bothered , Will ? " " No , and I 'm not gon na be your lover , either . I hired you for some civilized conversation , a snuggle , and a good long snooze . " He peered past the bottle lifted to his lips . " You 're a stunner , though . Like that yella dress you got on . " " Will , do you really mean you do n't want ? ? " " Fucking ? No . Do n't go all blushy on me , that 's a good straightforward word . People who rant and rave about impure speech usually do a lot worse things themselves , only secretly . " He stretched out and guzzled some more , admiring her cleavage . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain , she did n't lie to him . " It 's Ashton . Ashton Main . " " Southron , are n't you ? " " Yes , but do n't you dare ask how I got in a place like this . I hear that twenty times a week . " " You do that much fucking ? Damn . Wonderful to be young . Been so long for me , I nearly forget the particulars . " Ashton laughed , genuinely amused . She found the old codger likable . Maybe that was why she had n't lied . Sitting down by him , she said , " I 'll tell you this much . I was widowed unexpectedlyhere in Santa Fe . This hellhole was the only place I could find work . " 160 HEAVEN AND HELL " And you do n't plan to stay forever , huh ? " " No , sir . " She eyed the case . " You some kind of salesman ? " " The word 's peddler . The kind I am is starving . There 's engraved cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Territories Representative , Hochstein Piano Works , Chicago . " " Oh , that explains the picture of the fat lady . You sell a wonderful instrument . I saw Hochstein pianos in all the best homes in South Carolina . That 's where I grew up . Say , do you mind if I get ready for bed ? " He urged her to do it speedily . " Do you want me in a gown , or bare ? " " The latter , if you do n't mind . Keeps a man warmer . " Ashton proceeded to undress , unexpectedly enjoying herself . Fenway waved the empty bottle . " Have to correct one of your rem'lrks . I do n't sell Hochsteins , I try to sell ' em . This trip I 've only unloaded one Artist  --  hat 's the grand model pictured on the sales sheet . Cattle rancher in El Paso bought it , the dumb cluck .

Say , will you hurry up and lie down and keep me warm ? " She blew out the light and jumped under the coverlet and into the curve of his arm . Old and bony as he was , his flesh felt firm , his hand on her shoulder strong . Travel made him hardy , she supposed . His skin smelled lightly and pleasantly of winter- green oil . " You could certainly sell a piano here , " she said . " Maybe not a grand , but a spinet . The patrons are always yelling and screaming for music . " " Wo n't get it from Hochstein 's . " " Why not ? " " Old man Hochstein 's a Bible-thumper . Strict as sin in pub- lie , ' specially in the company of the old mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services him every week . But that 's his only relationship with ladies of your profession . Believe me , if I was allowed , I could put a Hochstein in just half of the sporting houses in Illinois , and retire . " " The market 's that rich ? " " Throw in Indiana and Iowa , I could live like a damn earl or duke . Hochstein wo n't touch the cathouse market , though . Competitionwo n't eit  --  hoa ! Where you going ? " " We need some light . We need a discussion . " A match scraped ; a flame brightened the room . She grabbed her blue silk robe with peacocks embroidered on it , a present from the senora . It was part of a batch of clothes the senora had taken from a girl she threw out . Fenway fussed about being cold . Ashton tucked the worn coverlet under his chin , making soothing sounds , then sat down again . " Willard ? " " Will , goddamn it , Will . I hate Willard . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea and you do n't know it . Would n't you like to give that old Mr. Hochstein a kick in the seat ? And make a lot of money in the bargain ? " " You bet I would . I been his slave twenty-two years now . But ? " " Would you stand some risk to do it ? " He thought about that . " I suppose . Depends on how much risk , for how much reward . " " Well , you just said you could live like a nobleman by selling pianos to parlor houses in three states . What if you sold them all over the West ? " Fenway looked bludgeoned , barely managing to croak , " My God , girl . You 're talking about El Dorado . " She clapped her hands . " Thought so . Will , we 're going to be partners . " " Partners ? I 've not been here ten minutes ? " " Yes , you have , and we 're partners , " she said , giving an emphatictoss of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do know how pianos are made ? " " Sure . The work I do n't know how to do myself , I could hire out . But just where would two piano-makers find the forty or fifty thousand dollars it would take to start up ? You tell me that . " " We 'll find it in Virginia City . Once you help me escape from this damn place . " Ashton leaned forward , the breast of an embroidered peacockbulged by the breast behind it . She smelled Fenway 's breath for the first time . Not the usual sewer smell of most customers . He 'd sweetened it up by chewing a clove . The clove mingled nicely with the wintergreen . She really liked the old fellow. 162 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 163 " Y'see , Will , my late husband had property in Virginia City . A mine . It belongs to me . All we have to do is get there . " " Why , yes , nothing to it , " he said . " It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Am I really hearing all this ? " " You surely are . Oh , wait . Have you got any strings on you ? " " You mean wives ? Nope . I wore out three , or they wore me out , not sure which . " He grinned . Below , someone broke a piece of furniture . Then Ashton heard the culprit yel  --  uis . Fenway failed to understand the venomous look that flashed over her face . " You telling me the truth , Miss Ashton ? Your husband owned a mine in Nevada ? " " The Mexican Mine . " " Why , I been there . I know that mine . It 's a big one . " " I wo n't lie to you , Will . I do n't have a paper to prove I own it . And the marriage license saying I 'm Mrs. Lamar Powell got left behind in Richmond . " " If we can reach Frisco , I know a gent who can fix up anotherpaper . " Ashton reveled in the way his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But that might not be enough ? " She laid his hand on the swelling peacock . " Oh , I 've got ways to persuade anybody who 's picky . " Fenway was beside himself , turning pink . " Keep talking , keep talking . You may be crazy , but I like it . " " The hardest par  --  eriously now , Will , no jok  --  he hardestpart will be getting out of here , and out of Santa Fe . The senora , the woman you paid , she 's a mean sort . Luis , her brotherin-law , he 's worse . Do you have a horse ? " " No . I travel the overland coaches . " " Could you buy two horses over at Fort Marcy , maybe ? " " Yes . I 've got enough for that , I think . " " And do you have a gun ? " The color in his face faded fast . " This gon na involve shoot-ing ? " " I ca n't tell . It might . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loaded gun , just in case . " " Well ? " A veined hand indicated the sample case . " Root around under those sales sheets . You 'll find an Allen pepperbox . She 's a good twenty-five years old , but she 's popular with travelingmen . " He cleared his throat . " Afraid mine 's for show . No ammunition . " " Then you 'll have to buy some . " While he was considering that , the altercation downstairs broke out again . A crashing sound suggested one person breaking furniture on the head of another . Ashton 's mouth twisted up meanly when she heard Luis bellow , " Pete , hUo de la chingada. iGonsalvo , y ddnde esta el cuchillo ? Te voy a cortar los huevos . " A ululating yell and hammering footfalls signaled the potentialvictim 's retreat . Fenway 's eyes bulged . " Was that the brother-in-law ? " " Never you mind . We can take care of hi  --  f we have a loaded gun . " " But I 'm a peaceable man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashton 's sweet smile distracted him from her malicious eyes . " I can . " She stroked his cheek , stubbled white at day 's end . " So I guess it 's up to you to decide , sweet . Would you rather keep dragging around the West , safe and poor , or take a little chance and maybe live rich forever ? " Fenway nibbled his lower lip . In the cantina Luis 's rumbling , grumbling voice recapitulated his recent brave triumph over the man who 'd fled . Fenway gazed at Ashton and thought , This is surely a piece of work . A remarkable piece of work . He had no illusions about the girl who was petting and cooingover him . Nor did she disguise what she was . Why , she practicallywrote it out on a sign , and would bid anyone who did n't like it to kiss her foot . He 'd already taken a fancy to the honeytalkingshe-wolf . She planted a chaste kiss on his lips . Moist mouth close to his , warm excited breath bathing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tongue while a finger fiddled in his ear . " Come on , Will , tell me . Poverty or pianos ? " His heart thumped at the prospect of her cleavage , the prospect of riche  --  nd the prospect of losing his life . " What the hell . Let 's try pianos . Partner . Two nights later , with an early winter storm deluging Santa Fe , Will Fenway returned with his sample case , just as he had the preceding evening , when they 'd laid their plans . Slightly wildeyed , he closed the door and leaned against it while the rain hammered the shutters . Ashton snatched the case from his hands and opened it on the bed . " Did you pay for the whole night ? " " No . Could n't afford it . " 164 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 165 " Will ? " she complained , cross and nervous . " Listen , I 'm beginning to think this is a damn-fool idea . I spent every cent I 've got on ammunition and those two nags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing cards downstairs without another soul in the place , ' cause of this rain . They 'll hear every sound . " " We 'll wait them out . " Ashton removed the Allen pepperbox from the otherwise empty case . She checked the revolving barrels to be sure they were all loaded , then laid her few meager pieces of clothing in the case . She had no rain cape ; she 'd have to get soaked . She felt a tightness in her chest , yet she was composed , in a cool sort of way . She laid the Oriental box in the case . " How long have we got ? " " An hour 's all I could pay for . " " It 'll have to do . We 'll go by the back stairs , and through the storeroom . Did you ? ? " " Yes . I did everything , " he said , snappish because of his fear . " The horses are in that little shed around back . But ? " " But nothing . " Ashton began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer cool or tangy with wintergreen , but slick , clammy . " Sit down , Will . Sit down and we 'll wait till it 's a little noisier . Luis gets noisy when he drinks . It 'll be all right , trust me . " From a pocket of his old frock coat Fenway took a silver watch , which he snapped open . He placed it on the bed . Both of them stared at the black hands . Ten past nine . The bigger hand ticked over a notch . One more minute gone . Ashton stood behind him , expertly kneading his tight neck and shoulders . " Now just do n't worry . We 'll pull it off , slick as anything . Partners as smart as we are , no one can stop us . " Except possibly Luis , who helped himself to another drink so noisily that Ashton and Fenway heard the bottle clinking against the glass . As time ran away from them , their luck appeared to do a miraculous turnabout . Luis began to serenade himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No me fastidies , " but he kept right on . Five minutes late  --  ine minutes before ten , the hour at which the senora would ascend the stairs and orderWill ou  --  he rainstorm intensified , complete with heavy rolls of thunder . " We 're going to make it , Will . We 're going to do itnow . " Ashtontied her lacy mantilla under her chin , a wispy scarf , but better than nothing . Pressing the closed case into his hand , she took the loaded Allen and opened the door . She examined the dim , rancid hall , lit by a single stubby candle in a tin sconce . The hall stretched straight back to the dark rear stairs , empty . Ashton 's breath hissed in and out as she edged forward . She whispered , with her mouth against his ear , " Step easy . Parts of the floor squeak if you come down hard . " With almost exaggerated tiptoe steps , they crept along the hall past the first closed door . Ashton heard the girl inside snoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second door , where they heard no sound at all from Rosa . Ashton risked going faster on the stairs . It worked until she reached the second step from the top , and Fenway put his weight down on the first one , which gave off a sound like a cat with its tail twisted . The rain had slackened . The sound carried . And their luck reversed completely again . Rosa 's door opened . Naked , she stepped into the hall , carryingher slops jar . Because of the stair noise , she immediately looked to the lef  --  nd saw them . Her scream probably carried all the way to Fort Marcy . " Senora ! /Senora ! /La puts Brett , se huye ! " " That 's it , " Ashton cried , grabbing Fenway 's lapels . " Go fast , lover . " She went plunging down the risers two at a time , and if she had missed one by chance , if she 'd fallen , she 'd have broken her neck . As if to tease the fugitives along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered , Ashton and her partner made it to the storeroom without so much as a stumble . Rosa , however , kept howling , and the instant Ashton started to slip through the maze of old broken crates , the senora 's voice joined in , exhorting Luis to hurry . The door from the cantina opened . An amber rectangle of light laid itself across the floor , revealing the fugitives near the back door . Luis charged toward them . Ashton fired the pepperbox. 166 HEAVEN AND HELLThrough the smoke , she saw Luis fall to one side . Then she saw the senora , in the cantina , wiping blood from her cheek . Blood from flying splinters ; Ashton 's ball had hit the frame of the door , and Luis had merely taken a dive to save himself . " Come on , Will , " Ashton cried , yanking the back door wide and jumping out into the mud and rain . Panting , Fenway followed . He pushed her to the left and , in doing so , gave her kneecap a ferocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell . Fenway caught her elbow and guided her . " Not far . That little shed . Here we are , here . " She smelled and heard the fretful animals . Luis appeared at the back door , pouring out a torrent of profanity . He lunged into the open and darted after them , only to pitch over when his right foot slipped in the mud . The way he yelled as he went down told Ashton he 'd broken or torn something . He sprawled on his side , groping toward the fugitives with his left hand . A faint glare of lightning showed his mud-slimed face . From the door , the senora screamed , " Levantate , Luis . Maldita seas . Levantate y siguelos . " No puedo , puta , me pasa algo a la pierna . " " Mount up , for Lord 's sake , " Fenway wailed . He was already in the saddle , clutching the handle of his sample case . Ashtonseemed to spend an eternity in the few seconds she stared at the tableau behind the cantina : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groping toward them with his outstretched hand while his pained face said he could n't . In that momentary eternity , a vivid cavalcade of large and small slurs , insults , unkindnesses passed through Ashton 's mind . The senora and Luis were equal offenders , but Luis was the nearer . She stepped two paces toward him , aimed the pepperbox with her arm rigid , and put a ball into his head . They clattered across the empty central plaza , rain-washed and gleaming . Ashton 's horse led . She 'd pulled her skirt up betweenher thighs and rode astride , bent low , watching for obstacles . From behind , Fenway cried , " Why 'd you shoot that man ? You did n't have to shoot him , he was down . " " Luis abused me . I hated him , " she screamed over her shoulder . Ahead , a pair of soldiers from the fort stepped into herA Winter Count 167path , rubber ponchos shining in the lightning flashes . One pulled the other back at the last moment ; both fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his rain-pelted face . He knew the little Carolina tart was stone-hearted , but he 'd never imagined she would go so far as to slay a helpless man . What kind of creature had he hooked up with anyway ? Nearly sick from excitement and the motion of the horse , he no longer felt liberated by their escape . Instead , he was gripped by a queasy sense of entrapment . Accustomed to horses since childhood , Ashton rode expertly , head down over the nag 's neck , her only guidance the occasional feeble flare of the lightning . She rode as if hell was behind her and nothing ahead would stop her , and her partner felt dragged along , captured , and pulled by her incredible force of will . He heard her cry , " We 'll make it , honey . We 'll outrun those greaser dogs . Keep riding ! " He might indeed outrun any pursuit , he thought as the horse carried him over the slick road like a cork in a typhoon sea , but he doubted he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hooked him . And she 'd committed murder . With his assistance . The deputy marshal for the territory and the commandant of Fort Marcy together questioned Senora Vasquez-Reilly , who said to them : " Of course I can tell you who murdered my sweet , innocent brother-in-law . I can describe her to perfection . I always doubted that she gave me her real name . So whether you ever catch her is up to you . " A Winter Count 16916In Richmond , a young doctor made the rounds of the Almshouse wards guided by the matron , Mrs. Pember . The doctor was new , a volunteer , like the others who tended these sad lumps of human refuse . Here and there a patient gave him a vacant glance , but most paid no attention . One man crouched beside his cot , exploring an invisible wall with the tips of his fingers . Another held a lively silent conversation with unseen listeners . A third sat with his arms crossed and tucked under , straitjacket fashion , weeping without a sound . The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cot . Near the cot at the end , a man sat hunched on a packing box by an open window . Even this late in the year , smoke still drifted from the burned sections of the city , hazing the thin autumn sunshine . The man on the packing box was staring out the window , southeast , toward the monuments in the city 's Jewish Burying Ground , which was separate from Shockoe Cemetery . His loathingwas evident . With her voice lowered , Mrs. Pember said , " Found unconscious in front of the State House , some weeks ago . " Pale and already exhausted by the ordeal of his rounds , the doctor studied the man with mingled disgust and sorrow . Once , the patient might have had a certain physical presence ; he was tall enough . Now he looked decayed , shrunken . Skin striations indicated obesity at some past time . Privation had pared away all the fat except for a sizable paunch . The patient 's left shoulder tilted lower than his right . He was barefoot and wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet robe donated to the Almshouse . On his head sat a battered plug hat . He glared at Mrs. Pember and the doctor . Still whispering , the matron said , " He claims he 's in constantpain . " " He looks it . Any history ? " " Only what he chooses to tell us . Sometimes he talks about falling from a high bluff into the James River . Then again he says his horse threw him at Five Forks , after the Yankees broke through General Eppa Hunton 's lines . He says he was with the reinforcements General Longstreet rushed from Richmond , too late to save ? " " I know all about the fall of Richmond , " the doctor interrupted , testy . " Does he have any papers ? " " Sir , how many men have papers since the government burned everything and ran ? " The doctor shrugged to acknowledge the point . He approached the patient . " Well , sir , how are we today ? " " Captain . It 's Captain . " " Captain what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . " Mrs. Pember stepped forward . " Last week , he gave his name as Erasmus Bellingham . The day before yesterday , he said it was Ezra Dayton . " The patient stared at her with strange yellow-brown eyes that held a hint of malice . The doctor said , " Please tell me how you feel this morning , sir . " " Anxious to be out of here . " " In good time . At least do Mrs. Pember the courtesy of taking off that filthy hat when you 're indoors . " He reached for the plug hat . The matron uttered a warning cry as the patient jumped up and threw the packing box at the doctor with ferociousforce . The box sailed over the doctor 's head , thudding in the aisle . The patient lunged . The doctor jumped back , yelling for orderlies . Two country boys in stained smocks raced down the aisle , rushed the man , restrained him , and wrestled him onto his cot . Even with youth and strength in their favor , the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly so hard , blood oozed from his ear . Finally , they subdued him , using rope to lash his wrists and170 HEAVEN AND HELL ' A Winter Count 171ankles to the iron cot frame . The doctor watched from the aisle , shaken . " That man 's a lunatic . " " All the other doctors would agree , sir . He 's positively the worst case in the Almshouse . " " Violent ? " The doctor shuddered . " A man like that will never get any better . " " It 's such a pity , the way the war damaged them . " Angered by the attack , he said , " These wards are too crowded to accommodate pity , Mrs. Pember . When he calms down , force laudanum on him , and a strong purgative . Tomorrowput him out on the street . Use the space for someone we can help . " The fire set during the flight of the Confederate government'shighest officials on the night of April 3 had swept from Capitol Square to the river , burning away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouses , printing plant  --  omethinglike a thousand buildings in twenty square blocks . Even the sprawling Gallego Flour Mill complex was gone , as were the rail trestles over the James . Few who walked through the burned zone in succeeding months forgot the sight . It was like prowling the surface of some world out among the stars , a world both alien and tantalizingly familiar . Its hills were mounds of brick and broken limestone . Black timbers were the charred bones of strange and mighty beasts . Sections of buildings stood like the grave markers of the alien race . Two nights after the Almshouse incident , the patient came stumbling through the mammoth Gallego ruins between the millraceand the Kanawha Canal . He 'd been given the shabbiest of used clothing and turned out . He would have paid back those who did it , but for the fact that more important prey demanded his attention . This evening he was enjoying great lucidity . He recalled in detail his fantasy of parading in the Grand Review . He also remembered the identities of those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of his country . Orry Main . George Hazard . God , how much he owed those two . Ever since they were all cadets at West Point , Hazard and Main had regularly conspired to thwart hirer Year after year , one or the other had turned up tointerfere with his career . They were responsible for a dizzying succession of falls from grace : Damage to his reputation in the Mexican War . Charges of cowardice at Shiloh Church . Punitive transfer to New Orleans , and desertion to Washington . Failure in Lafayette Baker 's secret police unit , and , finally , desertion to the South , whose people and principles he 'd always despised . All of it could be blamed on Main and Hazard . Their vindictivenatures . Their secret campaigns to spread calumnies that had ruined him . Sometime before he woke in the Almshouse , though exactly how long before , he could n't remember , he had made inquiries about Main in Richmond . A veteran had recalled Colonel Orry Main 's dying on the Petersburg lines . His other enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each man certainly had a family . He remembered he 'd tried to injure one of the Mains in Texas , before the war . Charle  --  hat was his name . Surely there were many other relativesHe tried to push all that out of mind temporarily and concentrate on the Gallego ruins . After an hour 's search he located what he believed to be the right spot . He knelt and dug through the rubble , hearing the sound of swiftly running water . It poured over a giant mill wheel that no longer turned . Like most everything in the South , the wheel was broken . Sharp fragments of brick hurt his fingers as he dug . Soon the fingers were covered with dust and blood . But he found what he 'd buried . His memory had n't abandoned him altogether . Clutching the rolled-up oil painting , he moved to a rectangle of brilliant moonlight , there brushing dust from his treasure . The moonlight fell through a window frame high in a jagged section of brick wall . As he brushed the painting , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Pinpoint lights began to flashHe remembered his name . He said it aloud . Beyond three walls standing at right angles to one another , a couple of black squatters by a bonfire turned toward the noise . One ambled over to investigate . After a look at the face of the man in the moonlit rectangle , he left quickly . With greater power and confidence , the man said it again . " Elkanah Bent . " Thin , bitter smoke drifted along the spectral walls . The172 HEAVEN AND HELLsmoke choked him . He coughed while trying to recall the face in the painting . . . trying . . . Yes . A quadroon whore . Where had he gotten her portrait ? Yes . A New Orleans sporting house . That cued an even more important memor  --  he purpose of his life .

" Bonaparte , " he cried to the moon and the smoke . " Bonaparte'smasterpiece ! " The squatters left their wind-tattered fire and melted into the dark . He tapped his plug hat to seat it firmly on his head and squared his tilted shoulders as best he could . The claw-hammer coat they 'd given him shone with age and grease in the moonlight . He executed a perfect military pivot and marched , like a man who had never been ill a moment . He strode into the sharpedgedshadow cast by another great broken wall , and there he temporarily vanished. 17The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scar and his braves . The Indians had relieved the white men of their weapons . Charles had refused to surrender his at first , but he relented when Wooden Foot insisted it was for their own good . " Do n't give ' em no excuse to kill us , Charlie . " The day darkened . Wind drove the snow into Charles 's face with stinging speed . Suddenly he knew the nature of the wispy fringe on Scar 's coat . " I should have recognized it . I saw scalps in Texas . That 's hair , " he said to Wooden Foot . " You 're right . A Dog Society man can wear that kind of decoration if he counts enough coup and kills enough enemies . " " Some of the fringe is yellow . There are no blond Indians . " " I told you , Charlie , we bought a load of grief this time . " The trader 's attention jumped back and forth between Charles and Fen . Straining in the travois poles , the collie barked and barked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw . " Do n't you do that , " Wooden Foot yelled , reddening . The braves laughed and veered away , satisfied with the reaction . The Cheyennes kept toying with their prisoners : riding close , touching them with their hands and coup sticks . Scar galloped next to the pack mules and with his lance slashed another canvas bag . Triangular pony beads cascaded to the snowy ground . Charles raised his hand . Wooden Foot grabbed it to restrain him . " Our hair 's worth more'n the goods . We just got to put up with them till we figure some way out . " 174 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 175First they came upon eight boys in fur robes stalking game with blunt arrows . Over the next rise they discovered the horse herd , around a hundred ponies , guarded by more boys . A gentle slope ran down to the Cimarron , where tipis stood along the snowy banks . The wind brought the odor of wood smoke . Quietly , Wooden Foot said , " No matter what they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I give you a cue real sudden , take it . " Charles nodded , though the trader 's meaning was n't entirely clear . Riding into the village , they created a stir . Old men , mothers with infants in cradleboards on their back , girls , children , dogs , poured from the tipis and crowded around , chattering and pointing , and not in a hostile way , Charles thought . Scar was the hostile one . He jumped from his pony and signed for them to do the same . Charles dismounted . He noticed buffalo hides pegged to the ground , and others stretched on vertical frames , but because of the bad weather , the outdoor work of the village had stopped . As he looked around , his eyes made contact with the large , intensely curious ones of a girl in the crowd . She had regular , even delicate features , and shining black hair . She was about fifteen , he judged , starting to look away . She gave him a quick smile to show that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braves crowded around . Wooden Foot took the offensivewith a flurry of signs and shouting . " Moketavato ! I 'll speak to him . " " I told you , Black Kettle is not here , " Scar said . " There are no peace chiefs to help you ; only war chiefs . " He spoke to his men . " Take their goods . " One of the Indians , in a cavalry fatigue blouse , started to slash open Charles 's saddlebags . Charles bolted forward to stop him . Wooden Foot yelled a warning , and someone behind him bashed his head with a rifle butt , knocking his hat off . A second blow drove him to his knees . The crowd exclaimed . Fen growled . Scar kicked the collie , making Fen yelp and snap . The Dog Men swarmed around the pack animals . They cut and tore the bags holding the iron scrapers , hoe blades , tin pots . The crowd pressed forward . Playing to them , Scar ordered his men to distribute the trade goods . Women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young girl was one of the few who held back , Charles noticed as he picked himself up . Here and there , someone'sface reproached the display of greed , but most of the villagerspaid no attention . Wooden Foot gazed around him with a peculiar expression , as though he had never seen tipis or Cheyennesbefore . Suddenly Scar announced , " These whites are devils , who plan to do us harm . Their goods , and their lives , belong to us . " His men made gruff noises to agree . Wooden Foot lost his bemused look . " Scar , this just is n't right . It is n't the way of the People . " Scar squared his shoulders . " It is mine . " " No-good little shit , " Wooden Foot said , loud enough to be heard . Scar understood , too . He gestured . " Kill them . " Charles 's stomach seemed to plummet a half mile . Wooden Foot flashed him a sharp look , snatched Boy 's hand , and lunged . The sudden move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through between two Dog Men . " Run for it , Charlie . This way . " Charles ran for it . An iron-bladed trade hatchet , hurled by a Dog Soldier , whisked by his ear . Women and old men screamed . Charles darted between two frightened grandfathers and oqt of the crowd . He did n't understand Wooden Foot 's sudden show of cowardice . What good was running ? They 'd only be caught again . Wooden Foot thrust his arm out to indicate a large heavily decorated tipi down a lane to his left . In front of it , snow melting on his gray hair and crossed arms , stood a heavy Indian with a dark , seamed face . Wooden Foot dived past him into the tipi , dragging Boy after him . Charles kept running . He heard and felt Scar 's men close behind . Of all the stupidity , he thought . Cornered in a tipi . Wooden Foot had lost his mind . He raced toward the old Cheyenne , expecting to be stopped . The gray-haired Indian flicked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charles nevertheless jumped through the oval opening . The Indian immediately stepped in front of it . A small fire in a shallow pit gave off acrid smoke but little176 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 177warmth . Crouching in the cold gloom , Charles picked up a stoneheadedhatchet lying near him . " Put that away , Charlie . " " What in hell 's wrong with you ? They 're right outside . " Angry voices verified it . Scar 's was loudest . While he snarled , the older Indian spoke in a calm , low voice . The snarls took on a note of frustration . " We do n't need weapons now , " Wooden Foot said . He pointed over his head . Hanging there , Charles saw what appeared to be a hat fashionedfrom the head of a buffalo . A pattern of blue beads decoratedit , and the horns were bright with painted designs . " That 's the Buffalo Hat , " Wooden Foot said . " Sacred , like the four Medicine Arrows . The hat wards off sickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away for good . That old priest outside , he guards it day and night . Anybody who shelters where the hat hangs ca n't be molested . " " You mean this is a sanctuary , like a church ? " " Yep . Scar ca n't touch us . " Charles shivered , cooling down as his sweat dried . He felt unexpectedly disgruntled . " Look , the war cured me of inviting fights . But if a fight starts , it galls me to run . " " You mean you think comin ' in here 's yella . " " Well ? " While the priest continued to argue with Scar , Wooden Foot said , " Did n't I tell you that you got to turn your notions upside down out here ? Why do you think Scar 's so mad ? We just did the biggest thin  --  mean the very bigges  --  ny Dog Society man can do . We was about to be beat , murdered , and we got away . That 's bigger'n the biggest coup . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Indian smiled in a friendly , admiring way . Charles began to believe what his partner had just said . The trader and the priest greeted one another with sign . " Half Bear , " Wooden Foot said , nodding and smiling . The priest said something in Cheyenne . To Charles the trader explained , " He just said my name . Man-with-Bad-Leg . " To Half Bear : " This yere 's my partner Charlie , and you remember my nephew , Boy . You know Scar did n't tell it straight , Half Bear . We always come peaceably , just to trade . " Charles understood when Half Bear said , " I know . " " When 's Black Kettle gettin ' back ? " The old Indian shrugged . " Today . Tomorrow . You stay here . Eat something . Be safe . " " Mighty fine with me , Half Bear . " Wooden Foot slapped Boy 's shoulder . Boy grinned . Charles did his best to rearrange his notions , the way Wooden Foot had advised . " My dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I will bring him . " " They took our guns and knives ? " " I will find those , too . " The priest left . Soon Fen lay beside the fire , happily rolling in the dirt . Charles had a lot of trouble believing that they 'd covered themselves with honor by running . He continued to think about it while Half Bear served them berries and strips of smoked buffalomeat . After the meal , the priest arranged fur robes and woven headrests for their comfort . Early next morning , Black Kettle rode in with a dozen braves . The members of the Jackson Trading Company , having rendered the inside of the tipi very fragrant out of natural necessity , were at last free to step into the open . In the sunlight that had followed the snow , Cheyennes of all ages again surrounded them , including the pretty girl Charles had noticed . He found himself smiled at , patted , greeted with exclamations of " How ! " which he interpreted as a word of approval . Of Scar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor in front of a cheering audience . He grinned all over the place . " No getting away from it , Charlie . We 're heroes . " Better weather brought a resumption of village life outdoors . Bands of boys again stalked rabbits with blunt arrows , training for a tribal hunt when they reached maturity . Women and girls set about their traditional work of scraping hides , stretching them on frames , and then smoke-curing them . Charles noticed a kind of pupil-and-teacher relationship in an attentive group of girls and mothers addressed by a much older woman . It was instruction by a member of the quilling society , Wooden Foot told him later . Decorative quilling had great religious significance for the Cheyennes , and had to be done in a prescribed way . Only women elected to the society could teach the art. 178 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 179Black Kettle invited Wooden Foot , Charles , and Boy into his lodge one evening . Charles now knew from conversations with the trader that the Cheyennes had a number of peace chiefs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was not at war . As Wooden Foot stressed , whites always wanted to deal with the chief , but he did n't exist . There were peace chiefs and war chiefs , as well as a chief for each cam  --  lack Kettle also held that position in his villag  --  nd there were leaders of the warrior societies . All of them collectively governed the tribe , which had numbered about three thousand people for as long as anyone could remember . If the tribe never increased , neither had it been diminished by disaster , starvation , or its foes . Charles 's respect for the Cheyennes went up another notch when he figured that out . The peace chief Moketavato was a well-built man of about sixty with braids wrapped in strips of otter fur . He had solemn eyes and an animated , intelligent face . He wore the familiar leggingsand breechclout and deerskin shirt , all heavily decorated , and , in his hair , a cluster of eagle feathers and three beaten silver coins strung on a thong . He passed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Just a couple of puffs of the smoke made Charles dizzy . His head filled with fanciful shapes and colors , and he wondered what sort of herb or grass was burning in the pipe bowl . The peace chief 's quiet and retiring wife , Medicine Woman Later , served a hearty turtle soup , then bowls of a savory stew . As they ate , Black Kettle apologized for Scar 's actions . " The loss of his mother robbed him of reason and warped his nature . We try to curb him , but it is hard . However , your trade goods are safe , and your animals . " As Wooden Foot thanked him , Charles popped another warm morsel of meat into his mouth , following custom by using his fingers . " Delicious stew , " he said . Black Kettle acknowledged that with a smile . " It is my wife 's finest , for honored guests . " " Young puppy dog , " Wooden Foot said . Charles almost threw up . He struggled to keep his mouth shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way down his throat against a series of strong spasms . Finally the piece went down , though it did n't settle well . He ate no more , merely made a show of fiddling with the bowl . " I hope that treaty you signed means peace for a while , " Wooden Foot said . " It is my hope also . Many of the People believe war is better . They believe only war will save our lands . " He turned slightly , to include Charles , and spoke more slowly . " I have always thought peace the best path , and I have tried to believe the white man 's promises . That is still my way , though fewer and fewer will go with me since Sand Creek . I took the People to Sand Creek becausethe soldier-chief at Fort Lyon said we would not be harmed if we settled there peacefully . We did , and Chivington came . So now I have no reason to believe promises , no reason but my own burning wish for peace . That is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trust . " " I understand , " Charles said . He liked Black Kettle , and saw the liking returned . Outside the tipi , firelight gleamed , and there was festive music . Boy smiled and marked time in the air with his finger . Charles cocked his head . " Is that a flute ? " " Yes , the courting flute , " Black Kettle said . " It is being played at the next tipi . Therefore it is Scar . He does have some interests besides war , which is a boon for the rest of us . Let us look . " They stepped into the twilight and saw Scar , near the adjacenttipi , playing a handmade wooden flute and moving his feet in a shuffling back-and-forth step . Black Kettle spoke a greeting . Scar started to return it , saw the traders and scowled . He blew several sour notes before he got the melody going again . Tied to Scar 's waist thong was a tuft of white fur . Wooden Foot pointed to it . " White-tailed deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow dog ran by , barking . Fen ran away in pursuit , barkingtoo . From the tipi that Scar was serenading , a young girl emerge  --  he same girl Charles had noticed the day he arrived . He saw a hand pushing the girl from inside . Evidently parents were forcing her out to acknowledge her suitor . " It is my sister 's child , Green Grass Woman , " Black Kettle said to Charles . " She is fifteen winters now . Scar has wooed her for two , and must continue for two more before she can become one of his wives . " The gentle swell of the girl 's breast showed that she deserved to be called Woman . She wore leggings and a long ornamented smocklike garment , which was pulled up to her groin and180 HEAVEN AND HELLbunched front and back by a rope between her legs . Strands of the rope wrapped her body from waist to knee ; she hobbled , rather than walked . Black Kettle saw Charles 's puzzlement . " She 's no longer a child but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her father ties the rope at night to guard her virtue . " Green Grass Woman tried to smile at Scar , but it was plain she did n't have much heart for it . Scar looked unhappy and shuffledhis moccasined feet faster . Then she noticed the observers . Her reaction to Charles was sudden and obvious . So was his . The stiffness startled him . Embarrassed about being attracted to someone so young , he turned to one side , hopingnothing showed . He eased his conscience by telling himself it was merely the girl 's beauty , the talk of sex , and his relatively long deprivation that caused the reaction . Black Kettle observed the exchange of glances and chuckled . " I heard that Green Grass Woman regarded you with favor , Charlee . " Scar saw it , too . He glared , stepping between the white men and the girl and turning his back on them . He spoke to her rapidly . She replied with equal speed and obvious tartness , irritatinghim . He deluged her with more pleading . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole , and stepped over . Before she disappeared , she cast another lovelorn glance at Charles . Scar 's face wrenched , a mask of black and copper in the light of a nearby fire . Clutching the flute , he stamped off . Fen shot into view , chased by the yellow dog . A baby howled . Wooden Foot sighed . " Well , I know it ai n't your fault . But now that no-good bully'sgot one more reason to hate us . " Next day they began trading . The weather turned unusually warm for early winter , enabling Wooden Foot to lead Boy to the riverbank at dusk . There , out of sight of the tipis , the trader gave his nephew a much-needed bath , something Boy could n't do for himself . Charles stripped , waded out , and washed himself clean . He felt reborn . During the trading sessions , Wooden Foot did all the bargaining . Charles fetched and displayed the goods and tended the horses given in exchange . Along with exposure to the details and complexities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 181tribe . In some ways the Indians remained primitive ; sanitation in the village was negligible , with food scraps and night soil carelesslythrown about . In other respects , Charles found the Cheyennesadmirable : instruction of the young , for instance . The Cheyennes considered manhood not merely something inevitable , but a privilege , carrying great responsibility . At night the sides of this or that tipi would be rolled up and tied while members of one of the warrior societies met inside at the fire , fully painted and dressed in society regalia . A large crowd of boys always gathered , as intended , and watched the men speak and dance and perform some of their less secret rituals . He never saw any of the village children disciplined , but one afternoon all of them were summoned to Black Kettle 's lodge , where a man who had stolen another 's buffalo robes was to be punished . The young boys and girls watched as the possessions of the thief and his weeping wife were brought forward . Their blanketswere torn and cut to shreds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clay pots and stamp on his woven backrests . Finally his tipi was slashed apart and the poles thrown on the fire . When the punishment was over and the crowd dispersed , the children took with them a vivid impression of what awaited them if they committed a similar crime when they grew up . Two Contraries lived in Black Kettle 's village . They were bachelors because the honored role of contrary required that . Singled out for exceptional bravery and their ability to think deeply about the ways of the tribe , they lived in tipis painted red and carried great long battle lances called thunder-bows . Their special rank demanded special , difficult behavior of them . They walked backwards . If invited to sit , they remained standing . The first contrary to whom Charles spoke said , " When you are finishedtrading , you will not leave us . " Wooden Foot explained that he meant they would leave . The Contraries were a small , strange , mystical order , each member greatly revered . The trading continued briskly and profitably for eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the dawn sky threatening rain . Wooden Foot wanted to get going . They dismantledand packed their tipi in six minute  --  eating their own time was a game Charles now thoroughly enjoye  --  nd after an hour of elaborate farewells to Black Kettle and the village elders , they rode south , herding fourteen new ponies ahead of them. 182 HEAVEN AND HELLThe wind smelled warm and wet . The tipis on the Cimarron disappeared behind them , and then the thin columns of smoke rising from them . Jogging easily on Satan , Charles thought of Green Grass Woman , whom he 'd encountered often in the little village . Each time , her pretty face left no doubt about her feelings . She was smitten . That flattered his vanity but it also made his hermit 's life somewhat harder to bear . One night he 'd had an erotic dream in which he lay with the girl . But every time he met her he did nothing more than tip his hat , smile , and mutter pleasantriesin English . He wondered if , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp , Charlie . " Wooden Foot 's sudden warning yanked him from the reverie . He pulled out his Colt as a mounted Indian burst from a stand of cottonwoods beside a meanderingcreek ahead of them . For a moment Charles expected a war party to follow . But no other horsemen charged out of the trees . The lone brave galloped toward them . Charles recognized Scar . Gloomy , Wooden Foot said , " He rode mighty fast and mighty far to get ahead of us . Somethin ' must be burnin ' him bad ? as if that 's a big surprise , huh ? " Scar trotted his pony up to them . His dark eyes fixed on Charles . " I have words to say . " " Well , we did n't figure you come out here to take the healthfulwaters , " Wooden Foot said , aggrieved . The sarcasm went right by the Indian , who jumped from his pony and took a wide , solid stance . " Get down , Charlie , " Wooden Foot said , dismounting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When ? the two traders were on the ground , Wooden Foot keeping hold of the rein of Boy 's horse , Scar stamped a foot . " You shamed me before my people . " " Oh , shit . " Wooden Foot sighed . " Anybody shamed anybody , it was you shamed yourself , Scar . We did nothin ' to warrantkillin ' . You know it , and Black Kettle knowed it , and if that 's your complaint , why ? " Scar grabbed him , furious . " We will meet at the Hanging Road . You will travel it . " His eyes jumped to Charles . " And you . " Dark as a plum , Wooden Foot said , " Let go my shirt . " ScarA Winter Count 183merely twisted it more . The trader shot his hand forward , caught the thong of Scar 's breechclout and snapped it . Scar yelled , releasedhim , leaped back as if snake-bit . " Why , what 's this ? " Wooden Foot said with exaggerated surprise . He pointed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " Inexplicably , Scar screamed and leaped for Wooden Foot 's throat . Charles yanked his Colt from the leather . " Hold it ! " The warning brought Scar up short , his fingers inches from Wooden Foot 's neck . The trader showed Scar his breechclout . " Gon na have trouble courtin ' that girl ' thout this . " He tucked the clout under his belt . " Yes , sir , a lot of trouble . " Scar clearly wanted to fight for it , but Charles 's Colt , pointed at his head , kept him from doing so . Quietly , Wooden Foot said , " Now you get goin ' ' fore my partner puts a bullet where your balls used to be . " Used to be ? What the hell was going on ? Scar 's departure , for one thing . His disfigured face looked more scarlet than brown . Puffed up as if about to explode , he sprang into the air , caught his pony 's mane , flung a leg over , and galloped away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to have to explain what you did . " Wooden Foot pulled the breechclout from his belt . " ' Memberwhat I said about Cheyennes cuttin ' their hair ? This is kinda like it . You take a man 's clout , he loses his sex . He thinks he ai n't a man any more . " Charles watched the Indian galloping fast into the north . " Well , now you and I are even . You gave him a reason to hate us too . " " I did at that , " the trader said as the flush left his face . " Pretty dumb , I s'pose . " He sniffed . " Enjoyed it , though . " " So did I. " Both men grinned . Wooden Foot clapped Charles on the shoulder , then held his palm to the sky . " She 's gon na be drizzlin ' soon . Let 's get movin ' , Boy .

All gave themselves high-sounding medieval names . Sir This , Lord That . With the pennons and great striped pavilions and gluttonousfeasts of barbecued pig or kid , the tourneys seemed too emblematic of the society the war swept away . If slavery was a benevolent institution ( so ran the unspoken argument of that society ) , those practicing it had a need to display themselves as persons above reproach . This soon translated itself into romanticexaggeratio  --  he fondness for Scott 's novels , endless disquisition about Southern chivalry , and tourneys . And where will they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you did , my dearest , in the Virginia woods and fields ? .. . About fifty ladies and gentlemen of the district gathered in the clearing at Six Oaks , by the river . Carriages were parked nearby , and horses tethered . The white spectators ringed twothirdsof the open space , with the low , wet ground nearest the river segregated for black coachmen and servants , all of whom had presumably entered into employment contracts with their masters . The winter day was warm . Long shafts of dust-moted light patterned the tan ground where three middle-aged riders gallopedin a line , their . lances leveled at the small wood rings hanging on strings tied to tree limbs . Hooves pounded . The first rider missed all the rings . So did the second . The third , a graybeard , speared one , then another . An old bugle blared in imitation of a herald 's trumpet ; the crowd rewarded the victor with desultory applause . While two more riders prepared , a fat woman who entirely filled one of the seats of a shabby open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say to you what I said to Cousin Desmond in my last letter , Randall .

Mrs. Asia LaMotte , one of the innumerable cousins of Francis and Justin , sweated excessively despite the mild temperature , and badly needed a bath . In the wrinkles and creases of her doughy neck , perspiration had hardened her powder into tiny pellets . Randall Gettys found her a disagreeable old woman but never showed it because of her family 's social standing and his friendshipfor Des . Poor Des , doing stevedore 's work , nigger 's work , on the Charleston docks to support himself . Gettys made sure no one was close by and listening before he said , " Asia , we can not simply march to Mont Royal in broad daylight and take action . The fire failed to frighten her .

" 186 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 187 " Then let him show the family by doing something , " Asia said with a sniff . " I tell you , we need ? " He got no further . A white man had tied his horse near the road and was strolling toward the black spectators . He was a young man , with a ruffian 's air . He had a dark beard , which showed even though he was closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked cocky but very poor in his gray homespun clothes , old cavalry boots , and a broad-brimmed cam- paign hat . In the waistband of his pants he carried a pair of Leech and Rigdon .36-caliber revolvers . Smiling , he stopped in front of one of the blacks , Asia LaMotte 's driver , Poke . Old Poke wore a cloth cap on his gray head . The stranger drew his revolvers and pointed them at Poke . " I surely do hate to see a nigger not respecting his betters . Takeoff that hat , boy . " Others around Poke stepped back , leaving the old man iso- lated and frightened . The two new contestants restrained their horses , fascinated like everyone else by the little tableau . Vastly amused , said take off the hatthe stranger drew back both hammers . " I Trembling , Pokee obeyed . " All right , now prove you 're genuinely respectful . Kneel down . " " I am a free man ?

" By the time the stranger said four , Poke was on his knees . The stranger laughed , put up his revolvers , patted Poke 's head , and acknowledged applause from a few of the spectators . He strolled toward a white-haired man in shabby clothes . Recog- nition and surprise popped Randall Gettys 's eyes as the young man engaged the older in conversation . " I 'll bet that 's him , " Gettys whispered . " I 'll bet a hundred dollars . " " Who ? " said Asia , petulant . " The roughneck Edward Woodville hired . Look , the two of them are thick as anything . " He was right ; the stranger , chatting amiably , had one hand on the old farmer 's shoulder . Gettys said , " Everybody knew Tom would n't sign on to work for Edward any more because the Bureau disapproved of Edward 's contract . So Edward swore he 'd give fifty dollars to any white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He hurried away . Asia looked befuddled . Gettys mopped his forehead with the big white handkerchief from his breast pocket . Despite the mild temperature , he was dressed in heavy dark-green velvet . He approached Woodville and the stranger . The latter stopped talking , put his thumb near his right-hand revolver , and gave Gettys a stare that froze his gizzard . Sweating , fawning , Gettys blurted , " Just wanted to say hello , sir . Welcome to the district . I 'm Mr. Gettys . I keep the crossroads store and edit our little paper , The White Thunder-bolt . " " You can trust Randall , " Woodville said . " He 's a good boy . " " I 'll take your word , " the stranger said . He shook hands , found Gettys 's soft and damp , and wiped his palm on his pants . " Captain Jack Jolly . Late of General Forrest 's cavalry battalion . " The two mounted men started their horses toward the hangingrings . The crowd hurrahed , but Gettys had eyes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Forrest . Are you hard of hearing or something ? " Gettys flinched away , raising his hands in apology . Captain Jolly , twenty-four but obviously tough and experienced , chuckled . " That Devil Forrest , as the damnyankees called him . I killed niggers for him at Fort Pillow , and I went the rest of the war riding at his side . Finest soldier in the Confederacy . Joe Johnston said so . He said Forrest would have been number one in the army , except he lacked formal schooling . " Gettys began to experience great excitement . " Do you have kinfolk in these parts , Captain Jolly ? " " No . There 's just my brothers and me , traveling and making a profit wherever we can . " He smiled at Woodville , who gazed at the ground . The farmer was smiling too .

He 's capable of doing what we dis-cussed . " The fat old woman peered at Gettys as if he were speaking Russian . The trumpet blared again . " Do n't you understand ? " he whispered .

THE SALARY OF THEPRESIDENT . The Secretary of the Treasury to-day signed a warrant in favor of Mrs. LINCOLN for the sum of $25,000 , less the amount Mr. LINCOLN had drawn for his salary in March last . . . . News report eight months after the assassinationJasper Dills , Esquire , turned seventy-four on Friday , the twentysecondof December , four days after Secretary of State Seward announced that the Thirteenth Amendment had been ratified . Childless and a widower for fifteen years , Dills had no relatives with whom he could celebrate the birthday or the Christmas season . He did n't care . Very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his position as Washington representative of certain large New York financial interests , and the ceaseless , endlessly fascinating battle for power in the nation 's political cockpit . In the autumn after Appomattox , however , he 'd found his practice diminishing . Some of the New York clients shifted their work to younger men ; other cases brought to his book-lined office on Seventh Street seemed of an increasingly trivial nature . Fortunately , to offset this , he continued to receive the Bent stipend . It helped pay for memberships in his clubs and the odd bottle of Mumm 's with his hotel suppers . Dills had long ago stopped letting his conscience bother him about the stipend . Two or three times a year he wrote a letter assuring Elkanah Bent 's mother that her illegitimate son was alive . According to Dills 's latest epistolary fiction , Bent was prosperingfrom cotton acreage in Texas . The woman never asked Dills for proof of such statements . He 'd built up a reservoir of trust since he saw her last , years ago , and he dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened to Bent after Colonel Lafayette Baker , head of the government 's secret police force , dismissed Bent for excessive brutality in the course of an arrest . Bent had vanished into Virginia , presumably a deserter to the Southern side. 190 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 191Should Bent 's mother discover that , or any other part of the truth , the stipend would end . The yearly total was substantial , so the mere thought of its loss alarmed the lawyer . At the same time , it did n't grieve him one bit to be shed of dealing personally with Elkanah Bent . An obese malcontent with persecution fantasies , Bent always blamed his career failures on others . Hardly any surprise in that : Bent 's late father , a Washington lobbyist named Starkwether , had chosen an unstable woman for his brood mare . She came from a large border-state family that included several persons with histories of mental disorder . One of them had even carried the taint to Washington , although she had managed to control or hide it during years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never acknowledged her son . He took his name from a farm couple who had raised him in Ohio . He 'd gone from Ohio to West Point , and then to failure after failure . By now , his mother was ancient ( in the way of the elderly , Dills still thought of himself as middle-aged ) , but the woman 's age did n't matter . Nothing mattered so long as she accepted his lies and wrote bank drafts regularly . To maintain his high living standard , Dills had recently taken on certain other work . He was a conduit through which five hundred or one thousand dollars could travel to this or that senator willing to use his influence to obtain an Army commissionfor the applicant . Dills skimmed a percentage for making it unnecessary for such a politician to meet personally and perhaps be seen with a former brevet colonel or brigadier desperately hunting reemployment . Dills fancied that he sanitized the bribe money as it passed from hand to hand . Dills was also a pardon broker . All sorts of Washingtonians had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than their sexual favors . A legal background had put Dills in the forefront of brokers . His connections with a few notable Democratsand many powerful Republicans helped too . At the moment he had thirty-nine pardon applications on his desk . Earlier in the year he 'd taken President Johnson an applicationfrom Charleston that bore an intriguing name : Main . That was the last name of one of the men Bent held responsible for his various difficulties , starting with his dismissal from West Point . Although the applicant 's first name was Cooper and that of Bent 's enemy was Orry , they were both South Carolinians , soDills assumed a connection . He 'd never been south of Richmond , but he envisioned the lower part of Dixie as one great heaving sea of cousins , all related and inbred by marriage . Nature arranged a wet snowfall for Dills 's birthday , a furtherguarantee of an empty office . He locked up and walked three blocks to the hushed rooms of his favorite club , the Concourse . He wandered through the club until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House . " Wadsworth . Good morning . Join me in a whiskey ? " " Bit early for me , Jasper . But do sit down . " Representative Wadsworth of Kentucky laid aside a copy of the Star and signaleda waiter to move a chair . Dills was a tiny man , with tiny hands and feet . Seated in the huge chair , he resembled a child . The whiskey arrived . Dills saluted his fellow member before he sipped . " What kind of session do you think it will be ? " His question referred to the Thirty-ninth Congress , reconvened early in the month . " Stormy , " Wadsworth said . " Issues that go all the way back to Wade-Davis remain unresolved , and the leadership of our party is dedicated to settling them . " Wade-Davis , a bill drafted in response to Lincoln 's moderate plan for Reconstruction , set much tougher requirements for readmission of the Confederate states . Lincoln had let the bill die with a pocket veto , thereby goading Congressmen Wade and Davis to restate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserting the right of the Congress to control postwar reunification . The Manifesto , published in Greeley 's ferociously Republican New York Tribune , marked out the lines of the battle to which Wadsworth referred . " Stormy , eh ? " Dills mused . " Rather a dramatic word . " He was thinking melodramatic . " But entirely appropriate , " the congressman said . " Look atthe forces already in motion . " He ticked them on his fingers . " Inboth the House and the Senate we have successfully denied seatsto the elected representatives from the traitor states . Complianceby those states with the President 's few requirements is notenough reparation for the crime of rebellion . Not nearly enough . Two , we have formed the Joint Committee on Reconstruction ? " " The Committee of Fifteen . A direct affront to Mr. Johnson . Really , though , do you construe it entirely as a radical apparatus ? 192 HEAVEN AND HELL I A Winter Count 193Most of the members are moderates or conservatives . Senator Fessenden , the chairman , is far from radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Thad Stevens and Sam Stout on the committee , do you have any doubt of its direction ? To continue " ? he folded another finger down ? " Lyman Trumbull is already drafting a Senate bill to extend the life of the Freedmen 's Bureau . If that does n't provoke His Accidency , I 'm Marse Bob Lee . " " I 'll grant you that one , " Dills said , nodding . Johnson 's op- position to the Bureau , on grounds that it interfered with the rights of the separate states , was one of the great running fights of his administration . Dills was reasonably familiar with the Bu- reau , because of a client , a rich political hack named Stanley Hazard . He was a member of the Pennsylvania family that in- cluded George Hazard , the second of Elkanah Bent 's declared enemies . Stanley had hired Dills for secret legal work involving ownership of some highly controversial property . " A friend of mine , " Dills continued , " close to the Bureau says they 're hearing all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricked into signing work contracts that are virtually slave labor agreements . " " Yes , precisely , " Wadsworth said . " Mississippi enacted its Black Codes in November . Among other things , they stipulate that a Negro can be arrested , even beaten , if he 's accused of vagrancy . Who 's to say what that is ? Is it occupying the same sidewalk as a white man ? Merely passing through a town ? It now that each of the erring sisters will enact similar codes , to guarantee a docile work force . They 're fools down there , Jasper , arrogant fools . Apparently the war taught them nothing . Those of us in the Congress must take over their instruction . " " Johnson will continue to resist . " " Of course . And when you speak of him , you raise the great central issue to which all the others are related . Where does polit- ical sovereignty rest ? Not with the President or his army , in my opinion . Military conquests made by the United States , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . I be- lieve that , Thad Stevens believes that , Ben Wade believes that . And we have a three to one majority in Congress to make our view prevail . Over the corpse of Mr. Johnson 's political future , if need be , " Wadsworth concluded with a smug smile . " Perhaps your word stormy hardly covers it , then . Should we say cataclysmic ? " Wadsworth shrugged . " Label it however you wish . Andrew Johnson is headed for disaster . " That subject exhausted , Wadsworth remarked that he had just returned from New York , where he 'd seen Joe Jefferson starringin his own adaptation of Rip Van Winkle . " Friends saw it in September at the Adelphi in London . They said it was a huge hit , not to be missed . I concur . You must see it , Jasper . " Dills replied that the theater did n't interest him . " Literature , then ? Have you read that amusing story about the California jumping frog ? It 's being reprinted everywhere . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dills said he did n't like fiction . He did n't deem it immoral , as many clerics did ; he only thought it inconsequential , unrelated to the real world . Wadsworth rose and consulted his pocket watch . " My dear Jasper , " he said wryly , " does anything in the world interest you ? " Seated in the plush chair , his tiny feet inches above the carpet , Dill said , " Power interests me . Who has it ? Who is losing it ? Who is scheming to regain it ? " " Then you 've certainly spent your life in the right town . And you 've got a damn good show ahead of you . If you 're a gambler , bet on my sid  --  o win . Oh , by the way , I saw the announcement on the members ' board . Happy birthday , Jasper . " Wadsworth left , his final words serving as the only celebrationfor Jasper Dills this year . No matter ; Dills was content with his clubs , his whiskey , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the coming struggle . " Cataclysmic " might not be an exaggeration , he thought . As Wadsworth said , one merely had to consider the forces involved , and the stakes . They were enormous . Nothing less than political control of Southern legislatures and Southern votes , which in turn meant control of Southern land and Southern wealth . In the course of Dills 's recent work for Stanley Hazard , his oafish client had shown some figures that vividly illustrated just how rich the pickings were . His imagination liberated by a second drink , Dills tried to foresee events . Certainly the issue of the Freedmen 's Bureau would touch off a new civil war . But the poor clod from Tennes-194 HEAVEN AND HELLsee would be outgeneraled by a Stevens , a Wade , a Stout , a Sumner . Johnson merely wanted to be fair and constitutionally correct ; they wanted to turn a minority party into the ruling party , with Negro votes tipping the balance . Johnson fought for principle , as did a few of the radicals . But the radicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own craving for power . Suddenly , pleased and smiling , Dills murmured , " A circus . That 's a better metaphor than weather , or war . " He immediately refined it to a Roman circus . With Mr. Johnson the Christian surrounded by ravening lions . There was no doubt how the contest would end . But it would certainly be worth watching . He must step up his pardon work , his influence peddling in connection with Army commissions , and even the number of letters perpetuating the fictions about Elkanah Bent . All of it would help him hold on to his box seat for the bloody spectacle soon to be enacted in the Washingtonarena . Congress passed a bill ; the President refuses to approve it , and then by proclamation puts as much of it in force as he sees fit . . . . A more studied outrage on the legislativeauthority of the people has never been perpetrated . . . . The authority of Congress is paramount and must be respected . From the Wade-Davis Manifesto AUGUST 186419The voice reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packed gallery , including Virgilia Hazard 's in the front row . It was the morning of January 8 , 1866 . Virgilia had listened to the speaker many times . Even so , he still had the power to send a shiver down her spine . Those who heard Representative Sam Stout , Republican of Indiana , for the first time always marveled that such a magnificent voice issued from such an unlikely body . Stout was round-shouldered and pale as a girl kept out of the sun . His thick brows and wavy , oildressedhair looked all the blacker by contrast . Congressman Stout was Virgilia 's lover . For some time he 'd kept her in a four-room cottage on Thirteenth Street , up in the Northern Liberties . He refused to do more than that , refused to be seen in public with her , because he was married to a flatchesteddrab named Emily , and because he had enormous ambition . This morning he was on the threshold of a great step upward . His speech was intended to remove any doubt about his qualifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar Radical positions . The South had in fact seceded , and Lincoln had been wrong to call the act constitutionally impossible . By seceding , the Confederate states had " committed suicide " and so were subject to regulation as " conquered provinces . " Virgilia knew the argument , and the key phrases , by heart . Knuckles white on the podium , Stout built to his climax . " And so , a philosophic chasm separates this deliberative body from the chief executive . It is a chasm so broad and deep , it can not , perhaps should not , be bridged . Our opponent 's view of the Constitution and the attendant political process epitomizes all196 HEAVEN AND HELLthat we rejec  --  ost especially a leniency toward the very people who nearly destroyed this republic . " He expected reaction there , and got it . Below , in special seats on the House floor , several senators led the applause . Among them Virgilia recognized the aristocratic Charles Sumner of Massachusetts , caned by a South Carolina hotspur at his Senatedesk before the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from Sumner and Thad Stevens in some respects , Sam Stout was like them in one essential way : he believed in the moral rightness of Negro equality , not merely in the political exploitationof it . " I have a vision for this nation , " he said after the applause subsided . " A vision I fear the chief executive does not share . It is a vision in which I see a willful and arrogant people humbled and rendered powerless , their corrupt society overturned , while anotherpeople , an entire race , is lifted from enforced inequality to a new and rightful position of full citizenship . It is a vision the leadership of this Congress must and will fulfill , while casting into ignoble disgrace and ruin any group or individual daring to oppose it . " His dark eyes raked the audience . " The chief executive has employed time and the calendar to circumvent the elected representatives of the people . While Congress was in recess , he implementedhis own illicit program . So let there be no misunderstanding . His actions can not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hereby thrown down . God bless and promote the noble crusade of this Congress . He will surely bring us victory . Thank you . " Virgilia rose for the standing ovation . Warm and not a little aroused by the rhetoric , she could n't wait to speak to Sam and praise him . The speech had become more openly hostile to Johnsonsince he 'd read her the draft last Saturday . She clapped so hard her hands hurt . George 's sister was forty-one now , and had the sort of mature , full-bosomed figure that a majority of men considered the ideal . Her monthly allowance from her lover enabled her to dress well , though she was careful never to attract attention with gaudiness . Today her dress and Eton were a deep maroon . Her furtrimmedwinter bonnet , cape , and gloves were a complimentary dark gray . She had learned to use cosmetics to minimize facial scars left by childhood pox . A Winter Count 197A tide of frock-coated admirers threatened to engulf Stout on the House floor . Watching , Virgilia was touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry him and bear children for him , even though her age , and his ambition , made the dream hopeless . Worse , she 'd lately heard gossip about his seeing another woman . By not speaking to him about it , not confronting him , she was trying to deny the existence of the rumor . Trying and failing . The Speaker gaveled for a recess . Virgilia fought her way downstairs , where she exchanged enthusiastic words with SenatorSumner . " Brilliant , " he declared . " Exactly on the mark . " As usual , his tone prohibited disagreement . Stout came through the doors , colleagues behind him , journalistsand well-wishers converging in front . Virgilia joined the rush but suddenly pulled up short , her heart plummeting . Stout 's eyes met hers and immediately shifted away , without recognition . She knotted her gloved hands together and watched her lover vanish in the crowd . A voice startled her . " Was n't that a tocsin , Virgilia ? Was n't that a call to war ? " She turned , struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you ? " " Much better since I heard Sam speak . The schism with Congress is entirely in the open now . Johnson will soon be on the run . " Virgilia had met Thad Stevens at a government function in the spring . He knew her family , and their shared ideals had quickly drawn them together . He had soon become her confidant ; he was the only person she had told about her relationship with Stout , and her earlier one with the escaped slave , Grady . There was a new word for mixed marriage , " miscegenation , " but it did n't apply to her . She and Grady had lived together out of wedlock . Stevens was understanding because of his principles and his great affection for his mulatto housekeeper , Lydia Smith . He guided her outside to the cool , pale sunshine washing over the Hill . At the other end of the muddy mall stood the unfinished monument to George Washington . Stevens said , " Governor Morton is a wise man to entrust Sam with the ap-pointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it 's definite ? " " By this evening it will be . Sam must leave the Committee of198 HEAVEN AND HELL Fifteen because we require nine House members , but he 'll con- tinue to guide our work behind the scenes . " " I ca n't wait to see him and congratulate him . " Stout had promised to take supper with her that evening . " Yes , well ? " Stevens coughed , a curious uneasiness in his eyes . " It would be wise not to expect too much of Sam for a while . He 'll be overwhelmed with the details of the new appoint- ment . " Virgilia heard the warning but she was too excited , and too ardent about her lover , to pay serious attention . When the war broke out , Virgilia Hazard had been adrift and emotionally exhausted . The grief of loss coupled with almost twenty years of abolitionist activity had drained her . During those two decades she 'd quarreled often with others in the Hazard family , especially George , over his friendship with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views had eventually driven her away from the family and into her relationship with Grady , who had been the property of Ashton Main 's husband before Virgilia helped him escape . She and Grady had joined John Brown 's small band of militant abolition- ists , and had taken part in his raid on Harpers Ferry in ' 59 . Army bullets had ended Grady 's life there . Soon after the start of the war , Virgilia had joined the Union nurse corps . In a field hospital , driven by a need to avenge Grady , she 'd let a wounded Confederate soldier bleed to death . Only Sam Stout 's covert intervention had spared her arrest and almost certain imprisonment . After that , they had become lovers . At the time , Virgilia had thought that what she 'd done was entirely right and justified . She had seen herself as a soldier at war , not a murderess . Lately , though , exhausted by regret and a strengthening wish to call back the dee  --  estore the soldier 's life ? she had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she expected to live with for the rest of her life . She no longer despised her brother George for liking Orry Main , or her brother Billy for marrying Brett . She had no wish to punish the South , as Sam and other Republicans did . Merely putting some of the key Republican tenets into law would be punishment enough . That was evident from the so-called Black Codes the various states were enacting to thwart the Freedmen 's Bureau . Virgilia meditated on all this as she stirred the juice of a pot roast on the cast-iron stove in her little cottage . A light , cold rain had begun to fall at dusk , when her mantel clock chimed half after five . Now it rang half past six . Still no signWait. - Above the pattering rain she heard wheels creak and a horse plopping through mud . She ran to the back door , pushed aside the curtain and watched Sam 's covered buggy pull into the little shed at the rear , safe from discovery by anyone passing on Thirteenth Street . A moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Virgilia 's smile faded . He had n't unhitchedthe horse . She opened the door while he was fishing for his key . " Come in , darling . Here , give me your hat . What a wretched night . " He walked in without looking at her . She closed the door and brushed water from the brim of his tall stovepipe hat . " Take off your cape . I 'll have supper ready in ? " " Never mind , " he said , still avoiding her eyes . He moved through the small dining room to the front of the cottage . Water oozed from his high-topped shoes and glistened on the polished floor . " I have an urgent meeting with Ben Butler . " " Tonight ? What can possibly be so pressing ? " His annoyance showed as he warmed his hands at the fire in the parlor hearth . " My new responsibilities . " He turned as she approached , and she was caught short by what she saw in his dark eyes . More exactly , by what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituent , and not a very familiar one . " Since Senator Ivey ca n't serve out his term because of ill health , " Stout said , " Governor Morton has announced my appointmentas Ivey 's replacement . In two years I 'll ask the state organization to nominate me for a full term . In the meantime , I 'll be able to push our program through and bring that damned Tennessee tailor to heel . " She took hold of his shoulders , exclaiming , " Senator Stout ! Thad said it might happen . Oh , Sam , I 'm so proud of you . " " It 's a very great honor . And a great responsibility . " Virgilia pressed against him , relishing the feel of his hard body squeezing her breasts . When she slipped her arms around his waist , she felt him stiffen . The magnificent voice dropped lower . " It will call for certain adjustments in my life . " She withdrew her hands slowly . " What kind of adjust-200 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 201ments ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At least have the courage to look me in the eye , Sam . " He did , and in the fire-flecked irises she saw rising anger . " An end to these meetings , for one . People have gotten wind of them , do n't ask me how . It was probably inevitable . Gossip is the grist of this town . You ca n't even keep a toothache private . In any case , looking beyond the Senate to higher offic  --  n ambition , I remind you , that I have never concealed ? " In the silence , Virgilia whispered , " Go on , Sam . Finish . " " For the sake of that future , I must shore up the public sideof my life . Be seen more often with Emily , distasteful as that ? " " Is it Emily ? " Virgilia broke in . " Or someone else ? I'veheard gossip , too . " " That remark 's unworthy of you . " " Perhaps . I ca n't help how I feel . " Emotion hardened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any of my actions to you . That was part of our agreement . It still is . Therefore I do n't choose to reply to your ques-tion . " From the iron stove she heard the hiss of the pot roast boilingdry . She smelled the burning meat and paid no attention . Stout laid down the curt , cold syllables one after another : " I almost expected this kind of reaction from you . That 's why I decided to make short work of parting . I will deposit the equivalent of six months of support in your bank account . After that it will be necessary for you to take care of yourself . " He walked away . A moment later she shook herself out of stunned immobility . " And that 's how it ends ? With a few sentences , and dismissal ? " He kept walking , through the smoke clouding off the stove where the scorching smell thickened . Virgilia 's fingers raked her dark hair , loosening pins . The hair spilled over her left shoulder . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's helped and advised you , Sam ? Someone who 's cared for you ? " At the back door , hat in hand , he turned again . She saw open hostility . " I am a United States senator now . Other people have a greater claim on me . " " Who ? That variety hall slut people talk about ? Is that who you 're off to see , that Miss Canary ? Tell me , Sam . " Screaming it , she ran at him . Her fist flew up . Stout caught her wrist and forced ter arm down . " You 're shouting loud enough for them to hear you at Willard 's . I do n't know this person you 're talking about ? " She sneered at him ; the lie showed in his eyes . " And although it 's none of your affair , I am spending the evening , as I told you , with Butler and several other gentlemen . The topic is how to thwart Mr. Johnson . " He pulled the door open . The rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the yard . " And now , Virgilia , if I have offered you sufficient explanation , perhaps you 'll grant me leave to go . I did n't want to part on these terms . Unfortunately you forced it . " He thumped his hat on his head and stalked down the steps . " Sam , " she cried , and again , " Sam ! " when he raced the buggy down the lane beside the house . The flying hooves of the horse flung up mud . Specks of it struck her cheek as she clung to the post supporting the porch canopy . The buggy swerved to the right and disappeared . " Sam . . . " The word dissolved into sobbing . She flung both arms around the post , trying to hold it as if it were a living creature . The slanting rain soaked her hair and streaked her face , dissolving the mud so that it ran like dark tears . Early the next afternoon , at her bank , Virgilia inquired about the balance in her account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ' support . Numb , stumbling once , she returned to the chilly winter sunshine and walked all the way home , carrying the burden of her certainty . She had seen the last of Senator Samuel G.

Still much unrest in the district ; and crowds on the roads , esp . the first Monday of the month , which has become " sale day , " when condemned lands are auctioned , and " draw day , " when freedmen journey for miles to Charleston and other centers , hoping the Bureau will distribute clothes , shoes , rations of corn .

We have one such tribe in the district , a sorry lot named Jolly . I have seen their ragged tents and campfires in the woods near Summerton a few times when desperate necessity has driven me to Gettys 's store .. . Captain Jack Jolly and his family settled in a grove of live oaks near the Dixie Store . The family consisted of its patriarch , young Jack , and his two married brothers , twenty and twentyoneyears old but already greatly experienced in the ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a whore in Macon ; the wife of the younger , fifteen years older than her husband , came from Bohemia , could n't speak English , and had arms as massive as a coal miner 's . Three dirt-caked infants lived with the Jolly  --  one of the adults was quite sure which man had fathered which youngste  --  nd several wild dogs hung around their trash-strewn encampment . Their tents were made of blankets stolen at gunpoint from the homes of freedmen . They also owned a mule and mule cart gotten the same way . Supplies were obtained by the simple expedientof a trip to Gettys 's store . On his way there in the dim March twilight , Captain Jolly stepped aside and tipped his old campaign hat as a handsome , big-breasted woman driving a wagon went by , heading in the direction of Charleston . Much taken with the tightness of the woman 's dress , Jolly bowed toward the wagon 's tailgate and called out , inviting her in explicit language to stop and let him pleasure her . The woman flung him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spunk , infuriated by the rejection . At Gettys 's store , he found what he wanted , a shiny new oil lantern . " This suits me , " he said , starting out . " Jolly , you 're going to send me to bankruptcy , " Randall Gettys exclaimed . " The price is four dollars . " 204 HEAVEN AND HELL " Not to me . " He drew one of his Leech and Rigdon revolv ers . " Ai n't that so ? " Gettys darted behind the counter . He 'd been a fool to invite Jolly and his tatty kinfolk to settle along the Ashley . The man was as dangerous as a rabid dog , and about as sensible . He and his family survived by thieving or taking corn rations on draw day in Charleston . One of the women told fortunes , and the Bohemianlady sold herself , he 'd heard . " All right , " Gettys said , sweat steaming his spectacles . " But I 'm keeping an account , because my friend Des and I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we discussed . " Jolly grinned , showing brown stumps of teeth . " Wish you 'd say when . I 'm gettin ' impatient .

Why , my God , Gettys , I 'll do her for free , no pay expected . Provided you let me have an hour with her , private , before I blow out her lamps . " Gettys mopped his damp face with the inevitable pocket handkerchief . " Des insists we wait for a pretext . A good , safe one . We do n't want those infernal Bureau soldiers investigating and going to Washington to testify , the way they 're doing with Tom 's murder .

He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Squire Revelle , of Greenville , in ' 58 , and Cassandra gave up hope of ever seeing him again . But her little boy is Nemo 's . When Foote discovered this , he drew a knife and tried to slash her . Andy threw him down and summoned me . I told them to settle it peaceably . This morning , Nemo is gone , Foote has established himself and Cassandra is wretchedly upset . Is there no end to the misery caused by " the peculiar institution " ? April , 1866 . History made in Washington , the papers say . President J. 's veto of the rights bill overridden by the Congress . Never before has major legislation been passed in this way , or a sitting President thus humiliated . . . . We are reaping the harvest of white against black . Town of Memphis devastated by three days of rioting touched off by confrontations between federal troop  --  olored men ? and angry white police . At least 40 dead , many more injured , and riot not yet under control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am sure the Committee of 15 will investigate . Col. Munro gone to Washington with a local black man to testify before the committee ... . " I know this is difficult for you , " Thaddeus Stevens said . " Please collect yourself and continue only when you 're completelyready . " Representative Elihu Washburne of Illinois groaned to protestStevens 's emotional tone . The congressman from Pennsylvaniacould manipulate a hearing until it began to resemble a tearladenmelodrama , which was exactly what he was doing with the poorly dressed black man seated at the table facing the committee members . Sitting behind the committee in one of the chairs for observers , Senator Sam Stout made a note to speak to the leadershipabout Washburne 's unseemly display . The witness wiped his cheeks with pale palms and finally struggled on with his testimony : " Ai n't much more to tell , sirs . My little brother Tom , he206 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 207said no to Mr. Woodville 's contrack . He was scared when he done it , but down in Charleston , Colonel Munro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The contrack say Tom must n't ever go off the farm without old Woodville sayin ' he could . And he got to be respeckful an ' polite all the time or he get no pay . An ' he could n't keep dog  --  om loved to hunt . He kep ' two fine hounds . " A heavy despair pressed down on Stout as he listened . Wit- ness after witness had reported on outrageous work contracts drawn up by Southern farmers who still wanted to be called mas- ter . Stout put some of the blame on ignorance , promoted by the South 's insularity . Men such as the one who had tried to contract with the deceased had grown up with an agricultural system based on intimidation , fea r , and bondage . They probably could n't imagine any other kind . So they kept writing these damned sinful contracts . The witness was watching Stevens . " Go on , sir , if you 're able , " Stevens prompted gently . " Well , like I say , the Colonel , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day Tom went back and tor old Mr. Woodville . Tom come over to take supper that night , which was the last time I saw him . He said Woodville got pretty mad with him . Two days later they found Tom lyin ' " ? the voice of the witness broke ? " lyin ' dead . " From the adjacent chair , Orpha Munro put his arm around the weeping black man . To the clerk Stevens said , " Let the record clearly show that the murder occurred as a consequence of the man Tom 's refusal to work under terms amounting to slavery . " " I must beg the pardon of my colleague . " Snappish , Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland waved his pen . " I am in sympathy with this gentleman 's loss . But he has brought forth no evidence to demonstrate conclusively a relationship between the unfortu- nate slaying and the events preceding it . " Stout glared at the Democrat , a politician of distinguished background who was nevertheless proving an obstructionist on the committee . Stevens too looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , Senator ? " " I do , sir . " " Let it be done , " Stevens said . " I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania , " Johnson said , satisfied and not the least grateful . No matter , Stout thought , controlling his anger . He and Ste- vens and the core group of Republican idealists in the Congress were very happy with the bulk of the testimony the committee had received . Black witnesses and Bureau officers from state after state had told stories of physical and legal abuse of freedmenwhilethe President kept asserting that Congress had no right to intervene . But the Tennessee tailor was on the run , while the Republicancause was blessed by accidents like the Memphis rioting . Further , to counter a possible court decision declaring the civil rights bill unconstitutional , there was already in preparation a Fourteenth Amendment , which would re-state the bill 's essential guarantees : full citizenship for all blacks and denial of representationto any state withholding the franchise from eligible males over twenty-one . The Joint Committee on Reconstruction would soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on the South 's effort to abridge freedom by illegal means , especially by enforcement of the Black Codes . The report would offer massive evidence of this activity and once again affirm the supremacy of the Congress in setting matters right . And if that did n't finish Johnson with the public , Stout and his fellow Radicals would write a second freedmen 's bill to extend the Bureau 's life . Johnsonwould veto it again , and be overridden again . Freedom 's army was on the march , and Sam Stout was one of its commandingofficers . The elderly witness had once more broken down . He sobbed into his hands despite Munro 's efforts to calm him . Stevens left the table . Stout rose . He and Stevens exchanged glances as the latter moved down to put a sympathetic hand on the shoulder of the witness . Senator Johnson showed disapproval of Steven 's behavior . Reporters in the back of the hearing room scribbled swiftly . Good , Stout thought as he slipped to the door . Tomorrow morning they could look forward to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence all Republicans , for continuing to comfort the oppressed . July , 1866 . More rioting . New Orleans this time . Courier says at least 200 dead . Andrew J. vetoed bill to continue Freedmen 's Bureau. 208 HEAVEN AND HELLThey say the veto will not stand , and so J. will seek a means to retaliate . He has found it . J. denounced the Fourteenth Amendment , urging our state and all of Dixie not to ratify it . Tennessee immediately ratified it , and Gov . Brownlo  --  he ' Parson " ? notified Washington with the words , " Give my respectsto the dead dog in the White House . " What next ? KILLING OF A NEGROBY GEN . FORREST . A ' letter from Sunflower County , Miss. , says a negro employed on Gen. FORREST 'S plantation , while assaulting his ( the negro 's ) sick wife yesterday , was remonstrated with by FORREST .

Outside he added two stick figures waving hatchets and a third with stick hands covering the fork of his stick legs . Whenever Boy saw that part of the picture he put his hands over his mouth , Indian fashion , and giggled . As the snowdrifts began to melt , a white visitor rode into the Cheyenne village where the traders had wintered . Broad smiles and shouting greeted him . Mothers raised their babes to touch the black cassock visible under a buffalo robe . Wooden Foot presentedCharles to the weathered , gray-haired Jesuit missionary . Father Pierre-Jean DeSmet was sixty-five now , a legendary figure . Born in Belgium , he 'd emigrated to America as a young man . In 1823 , he 'd left the Catholic novitiate near St. Louis to begin his remarkable career on the Plains . He not only proselytizedthe Indians , he also became their partisan . Some of his journeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sioux , the Blackfeet , the Cheyennes , and other tribes he was " Blackrobe , " a confessor , a mediator , a spokesman in councils of the white men , a friend . Over the evening fire , DeSmet displayed good humor and a broad knowledge of Indian affairs . There was no doubt of his loyalty : " Mr. Main , I say to you that if the Indians sin against the whites , it is only because the whites have greatly sinned against them . If they become angry , it is because the whites provoked them . I accept no other explanation . Only when Washington210 HEAVEN AND HELLabandons truculence as an official policy will peace prevail on these plains . " " What do you think the chances are that it will happen , Father ? " " Poor , " DeSmet said . " Greed too often conquers a godly impulse . But that does not defeat me or discourage me . I will strive to bring a peaceable kingdom till God calls me home . " Three roads carried most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oregon followed the valley of the Platte , with a newer branch , Bozeman 's Trail , veering off to the Montana gold fields . The Santa Fe Trail ran southwest to New Mexico . Lying between the northern and southern routes , the Smoky Hill Road followed the river along a generally westerly route to the Colorado mines . In May of ' 66 the Jackson Trading Company met another white man while still thirty miles south of the Smoky Hill . The man drove a covered wagon , wore braids , and had cut the hair over his forehead in bangs , then greased it so that it stood up . He was fat , with a face that reminded Charles of a Father Christmas who 'd just come off a week 's binge . He greeted the traders cordiallyand invited them to camp the night with him . " No thanks . We 're in a hurry , Glyn , " Wooden Foot said , not smiling . He signaled his companions to ride on . Once past the wagon , Charles looked over his shoulder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen or fifteen , peeking at them from the back of it . He had an impression of prettiness ruined by too much eating ; the girl had the multiple chins of a woman of middle age . " Surely was obvious you did n't like that man , " Charles said . " Competition , is he ? " " Not for us . He peddles spirits and guns . Name 's Septimus Glyn . Worked for the Upper Arkansas Agency a while . Even the Indian Bureau could n't stomach him . He sneaks around sellin ' what he should n't , and every season or so he picks out some young girl , honeys her up with promises , gives her the jug till she grows fond of it , then takes her away with him . When she 's no good for anything but whorin ' , he sells her . " " I saw a girl in the wagon . " " Do n't doubt it . " Disgusted , Wooden Foot did n't turn around to verify it . " Must be a Crow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're a handsome people , but he 'll ruin her looks ' fore he 's done , the no-good whoremaster . " Charles watched the wagon receding on the rim of the gray plain and was glad he had n't been forced to socialize with SeptimusGlyn . When he saw Willa Parker , he must tell her that not all whites exploited the Indians . Jackson did n't . Neither did the Jesuit priest . He hoped that little bit of information would be pleasing . He found himself wanting to please her . They reached the Smoky Hill route with their forty-six ponies ; all their trading goods were gone . Wooden Foot repeatedly said his new partner brought him luck . They 'd seen no white men other than Glyn south of the Smoky Hill . Once on the trail , though , they fought eastward against a tide of galloping cavalry troops , Overland coaches , emigrantwagons . One party of wagons , driven two and three abreast , refused to allow them any clearance , and so the traders had to halloo their pack mules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxen nearly trampled Fen . Two valuable poniesran away . After the traders got through the wagons , they reined up . They looked as though they 'd coated their faces in yellow flour . The dust made their eyes all the larger and whiter . " Swear to God , Charlie , I never seen so many greenhorn wagons this early in the season . " " And the traffic 's bound to make the Sioux and Cheyennes mad , is n't it ? " " You 're right , " Wooden Foot said . Charles watched the canvas tops lurching west . " I had a strange reaction when those wagons would n't give us room . All of a sudden I understood how the Indians feel . " Thirty miles outside Fort Riley , Kansas , they saw the first stakes marking the route of the oncoming railroad . Every mile or so thereafter , they passed piles of telegraph poles waiting to be planted . One pile was nothing but ashes and charred wood . " The tribes are ' bout as partial to the talkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked . They rode on . Weather-burned and toughened by his return to a life outdoors , Charles felt fit and very much in harmony with his surroundings . His burned-out feeling was disappearing , re-212 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 213placed by renewed energy and a zest for living . If he was not yet healed , healing had begun . The morning was warm . He cast off his gypsy robe , pushed up the sleeves of his long johns , and lit a cigar , noticing eight more vehicles coming toward them over the prairie . These turned out to be high-wheeled canvas-covered U.S. Army ambulances , each pulled by two horses . Mounted soldiers formed a moving defense ring around the vehicles . " Who the hell 's this ? " Wooden Foot said . They ran their mules and ponies in a circle and waited . The ambulances stopped . A colonel jumped down and greeted-them . A second officer hopped out of the lead wagon , a stringy fellow with a hawk face and bristly red hair mixed with gray . His face startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the general . " Where have you gentlemen come from ? " " The Indian Territory , " Wooden Foot said . " We wintered with the Cheyennes , " Charles said . " I am on an inspection tour . What 's their state of mind ? " " Well , " Wooden Foot said , cautious , " considerin ' that no one chief or village represents the whole shebang , I guess I 'd say the tribe 's mood is distrustful . Black Kettle , the peace chief , he told us he did n't know how long he could hold his young men back . " " Oh yes ? " said the general , bristling . " Then I 'd better talk to that redskin . If one more white man is scalped out here , I wo n't be able to hold my men back , either . " After that he calmed down . Charles puffed on his cigar and exhaled blue smoke . The general gave him a keen look . " Did I detect a trace of Southern speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General . I rode for Wade Hampton . " " An able soldier . You like cigars , sir . " Charles nodded . " I do , too . You 're welcome to a fresh one of mine while we cook up some food . " " No thanks , General . I 'm anxious to head on east and visit my son . " " Safe journey , then . " The stringy officer gave them a casual salute and he and the colonel returned to their ambulance . As soon as they got the horses moving , Wooden Foot said , " You know that shoulder-straps ? " " Sure . That is , I 've seen pictures . His bummers burned a whole lot of my home state . " " Lord God , you do n't mean that 's Uncle Billy Sherman ? " " Yes , I do . Wonder what he 's doing out here ? " At Riley , they learned the answer . Sherman had commandedthe Division of the Mississippi since shortly after Charles passed through Chicago . He 'd shifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had persuaded Grant to create a Departmentof the Platte , to shrink the unwieldy Department of the Missouri and promote better management of both within the Division . This displeased John Pope , the commander of the MissouriDepartment . There were inevitable Army rumors to go with the facts . The larger administrative unit would soon be renamed Division of the Missouri . Shennan thought the Department of the Platte 's commander , St. George Cooke , too old at fifty-six . He wanted WinfieldHancock , " Superb " Hancock of Gettysburg , to replace Pope . He wanted Congress to authorize new infantry and cavalry regiments , assigning some of them to Plains duty , although it could n't be done in time to help the 1866 travel season . Charles got the idea that Sherman had strong , largely negativeviews about Indians , yet did not want to become involved in making policy that affected them . " Sheriffs of the nation , " that was Sherman 's definition of the Army 's role . Pope was more of an activist . He had insisted that emigrant trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , his regiments would n't be responsible for them . At the sutler 's , Charles picked up a letter from Duncan . " Why , he 's a whole lot closer than when I left . They transferred him to Fort Leavenworth in January . Let 's hurry up and sell those horses . " By the first of June all the animals were gone , having fetched just over two thousand dollars for the company . The traders rode east and , at Topeka , banked their money , each man keeping fifty dollars for personal expenses . On the winter count Wooden Foot painted three sacks bearing dollar signs . He and Charles shook hands , Charles hugged Boy , and they agreed to rendezvous on the first of September. 214 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 215With a sly look , Wooden Foot said , " Bound anyplace ' sides Leavenworth ? Case I need you , understand . " " Oh " ? Charles settled ' in Satan 's saddle ? " maybe St. Louis . Have a barber work me over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take in a show . I met that actress , remember . " " Mmm , that 's right . Nearly slipped my mind . " Charles smiled . " The saucy freethinker who does n't give a snap if people scorn her for invitin ' a gent to supper . " " That 's the one . " " You been so impatient , I figured you had somethin ' in mind . So it 's that there Augusta . " Suddenly bleak , Charles said , " Augusta was my son 's mother . She 's dead . I 've never mentioned her name . " " Not woke up you have n't . You talk in your sleep , Charlie . I figured it was a happy dream . I 'm sorry . " " That 's all right . " " I want you to feel good . You 're my friend . It was damn lucky we met up at Jefferson Barracks . " " I feel the same . " " Say hello to your youngster and do n't get yourself kilt in no tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rode away . A road ran due north from Leavenworth City to the military reservation . Charles cantered along this two-mile stretch , passing neat farm plots and the headquarters of Russell , Majors and Waddell , a huge enclave of parked wagons , piled-up freight , penned oxen , noisy and profane teamsters . The river flowed along out of sight under the high bluff on his right . The ten-square-mile post contained department headquarters , barracks and support facilities for six companies , and the large quartermaster 's depot serving the forts to the west . Colonel Henry Leavenworth had established the original cantonment in 1827 , on the Missouri 's right bank near its confluence with the Kaw . Jack Duncan 's quarters were typical of Western military posts . Spartan rooms furnished with an old sheet-iron stove and whatever furniture the occupant brought , bought , or built from crates and lumber . Normally , the brigadier would have lived in smaller space ? " Old Bedlam , " the bachelor officers ' quarters ? but he 'd ranked a married captain and thus moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , so that he and Maureen and Gus could move in . This happened frequently to junior officers ; the term for it was " the bricks falling in . " Charles could n't believe how much his son had grown since last autumn . Little Gus walked around Duncan 's parlor so fast , swaying , that Charles was constantly starting to dive for the boy , to catch him if he fell . It amused Duncan . " No need for that . He 's damn steady . " Charles quickly saw this was so . " He does n't know me , Jack . " " Of course not . " Duncan held out his hands . " Gus , come to Uncle . " The boy clambered to his lap without hesitation . Duncan pointed to the visitor . " That 's your father . Want to go to your father ? " Charles reached out to take him . Gus screamed . " I think it 's your beard , " Duncan said . Charles saw no humor in it . He struggled for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he finally did , he soon had him clinging to his thumbs and laughing as he bounced him up and down on his knee . Maureen appeared from the kitchen and expresseddisapproval . Charles did n't stop . Duncan leaned back and lit a pipe . " You look good , Charles . The life agrees with you . " " I miss Augusta and always will . Apart from that , I 've never been happier . " " This Adolphus Jackson must be a fine fellow . " " The best . " Charles cleared his throat . " Jack , I need to say something else about Augusta . Well , actually , about a woman I met in St. Louis . An actress in one of the theaters there . I 'd like to pay her a call . But I do n't want to dishonor Gus 's memory . " Soberly , Duncan said , " You 're a decent and considerate man . There are many who would n't even worry . I do n't expect you to live like an anchorite the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man needs a woman , that 's a fact of life . Go to St. Louis . as soon as you want . " " Thank you , Jack . " He beamed at Maureen , still hovering near and frowning over his rag-bag wardrobe , his tangled beard , his way of handling his son . Charles just ignored it . " Life 's too good to be believed , " he said , gazing at his son , whose features had begun to favor his mother. 216 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 217Duncan smiled . " I 'm glad . We all went long enough feeling the other way in the late unpleasantness . " Up went the curtain . The players joined hands and stepped to the apron , Trump pulling the others along and then snatching off his woodcutter 's cap . He waved the cap to acknowledge the applause , thus drawing attention from the others in the company . He unpinned his good-luck chrysanthemum from his coarse tunic and tossed the wilted flower , more brown than white , into the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw it away . The company bowed again . Then Trump took a third , solo , bow . The woman playing his wife exchanged long-suffering looks with Willa , who was prettily dressed in a high-waisted gown for her role as one of the young lovers . The play was Moliere 's Physi- cian in Spite of Himself , which had been " amplified and emended by Mr. Trump , " according to posters outside . It seemed to Charles , standing up and clapping hard in the front box at stage left , that the unraveling of the farcical plot about a woodcutter pretending to be a famous doctor had stopped completely at least four times while Sam Trump performed comic monologues that did n't sound like the rest of the play ; one described hotels with peculiar French names . The largely male audience roared , appar- ently understanding some local references . Charles really did n't care how much Trump had rewritten Moliere . Like most of those out front , he was taken with Willa Parker 's stage presence . From her first entrance , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some intangible power that drew the eye and held it when she was on stage . Maybe all great performers had that quality . He extended his hands over the rail , still clapping . The movement drew Willa 's attention to the box . Charles had paid for a bath and beard trim and had bought an inexpensive brown frock coat and matching trousers . Willa saw him , recognized him , and reacted with what he perceived as surprise , then plea- sure . Charles nodded and smiled . Suddenly Willa 's glance shifted to a box on the opposite side . An empty box , though the curtain still moved , stirred by someone leaving . The stage curtain rolled down , revealing painted messages about restaurants and shops . The applause died . The audience of men and a very few ladies with escorts began to file out . Charles , wondered what , or who , had brought that flash of anxiety to Willa 's face . Eager and surprisingly nervous , he hurried around to the stage entrance , where he 'd stopped the teamster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorkeeper half a dollar , being pushed from behind by other gentlemen equally intent on going inside . Because of his height , Charles could look over corridor leading to dressing rooms . In order to visit anyone , people had to pass Trump and compliment him . Charles did so enthusiastically . Eyes glassy with joy , Trump said , " Thank you , dear boy , thank you . " Brown dye trickled from behind his ears . " Yours is a familiar face . Was it Boston ? I have it ! Cincinnati . " " St. Louis . I have a beard now . " He extended his hand . " Charles Main . " " Of course . I remember it clearly . " He did n't . " Frightfully glad you caught us tonight . I 'm anticipating sold-out houses starting tomorrow . " His eyes had already hopped over Charles 's shoulder , hunting the next admirer . Charles slipped by , smelling sweat on Trump but no spirits . Willa must have succeeded in drying him out . All the dressing-room doors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was hers , since a short , neatly dressed man was already waiting outside . As Charles approached , the man turned . Instantly , Charles recognized the unnaturally stiff posture , the trimmed goatee and waxy mustache points , the shoes with a high polish , the clothes without a wrinkle . Willa 's admirer was the man who 'd kept him out of the Army . Captain Harry Venable . A Winter Count 21921Charles 's nerves wound tight as he walked up to Harry Venable . The dapper officer apparently did n't recognize him , though he understood Charles 's intent . Charles read the lettering painted on the door . MRS . PARKER . He stepped forward to knock and Venableslipped in front of him . " Excuse me . Mrs. Parker 's engaged . " Charles looked down into the glacial eyes , tilting his head to exaggerate the height difference . " Fine . Shall we let her tell me that ? " He reached over Venable 's shoulder and knocked . Venable turned scarlet . Willa called out , asking him to be patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you smiling about ? " " Handsome Harry Venable " ? Charles began rubbing the knuckles of his left hand ? " West Point class of ' 59 . " Flustered , Venable tried to identify the bearded stranger . Charles continued , " Last time we met , you had some helpers . I see you have n't any now . If there 's some sort of dispute , perhaps we can settle it fairly this time . " His teeth gleamed in his beard but the smile was n't friendly . He kept rubbing his knuckles . Venablerecognized him . Then the door opened . All in a rush , Willa seized him and hugged him . " Charles ! I could n't believe it when I saw you in the box ? " She stepped back , gripping his arms while she studied him . She wore a pastel wrapper , an outer layer of gauzy material with opaque satin beneath . Delicate transparent butterflies decoratedthe gauze . Although tightly belted , the gown did n't quite hide her cleavage . A spot of cold cream glistened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging free , she looked unkempt and absolutely lovely . " Here , do come in while I take off the rest of this make-up . " As she tugged him into the dressing room she dabbed a cloth behind her ear ; it came away orange . Through this , Venable stood rigid , shoulders back , unable to conceal his fury . Good actress that she was , Willa smiled and spoke to him graciously . " Colonel , I 'm so sorry to refuse again . Mr. Main and I have a long-standing engagement . I 'm sure you understand . " She closed the door . " I have a long-standing engagement to beat the hell out of that little toad . He 's the one who recognized me at Jefferson Barracks . " " Well , he 's still stationed there . " Willa snatched pins from the dressing table and began pinning up her hair . The small room was a confusion of costumes , personal clothing , make-up pots and brushes , playscripts , all the clutter increased by its reflection in the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's been hounding me ever since . Oh , Charles , you 've been gone so long . " " It 's a long way to the Indian Territory . " He found himself gazing into her blue eyes with more intensity than he planned . " I know . And I thought you 'd never get back . When I saw you , halfway through the first act , I nearly walked into that bench . " " I did n't think you saw me until the curtain call . " " Oh , long before that . I kept dropping lines . " " I did n't notice . " " You are n't supposed to notice . " On tiptoe , she kissed his cheek , then hugged him again . Her body felt very ' soft and ripe beneath the butterfly gauze . " May we have supper ? " " Absolutely . " He grinned . " No snails this time . " " All right . Wait for me in the hall . I 'll be ready in two minutes . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the hall , he saw no sign of Venable . It was a relief . He felt too grand to interrupt the evening with a brawl . He knew that , one to one , he could easily beat the small man , so a fight would mean an inevitable load of guilt afterward . Just before Charles and Willa left the theater , she waved to Sam Trump standing in the wings with Prosperity , the theater220 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 221cat , in his arms . Trump broke off his conversation with a stagehandand nodded to acknowledge them . He gave Charles a peculiarstare , then watched them as they vanished through the Olive Street door . On the sidewalk , something made Charles stop . She said , " What is it ? Oh . " She saw him too , across the street in the shadow cast by the wooden Indian chief in front of the tobacconist 's . Discovered , Venable executed a right face and hurried around the corner . Willa shivered . " What a strange man . " " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm here . " " Back at the dressing room there was a moment when he looked ready to murder you , Charles . " " He tried it once . Did n't get away with it . " He reached over to pat the mittened hand on his right arm . " I 'm for supper . The New Planter 's House ? " " Why not ? It 's convenient . I 've moved there . Yes , out of the scene loft . " They began walking arm in arm through the night streets . " The playhouse has been in the black since February . Not by much , but in the black . The company has established a local following , so the hotel management offered me rooms at a reducedrate . Evidently Mr. Trump and Mrs. Parker are now welcomeall over town . " He chuckled ; the faint cynicism he heard reminded him of her maturity . He remarked on it as they sat in the familiar dining room , both of them with juicy venison steaks . This time , he 'd ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . Telling the truth . Not only are you ver  --  ellworldlyfor someone your age , but you 're brighter than most men I know . " A little gesture deprecated the praise . " If it 's at all true , andI 'm not sure it is , maybe it 's because I grew up in the theater . Knowing plays made me hungry for other kinds of books . Andmy father was liberal about education for girls . He believed in it . " They fell to discussing what had happened to her since theirlast meeting . Trump 's St. Louis Playhouse had assembled its permanentcompany . " Actors are now willing to sign contracts for aseason , because I 've convinced them Sam wo n't drink up theprofits . " The company had four plays in repertory and was startingto think about touring . " Do you know there is n't a decenttheater between here and Salt Lake City ? I should imagine that all those new towns going up along the railroad would be ideal for a traveling company with its own tent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . A waiter poured rich dark coffee from a silver pot . " You do love the life , do n't you ? " " Yes , I do . Bu  --  ere I go , brazen again . " Her cheeks colored as she gazed at him . " I thought about you often during the winter . " That gaze ignited something in him . He knew he should retreat ; could not . " I thought about you , Willa . " She drew her hands into her lap . Very quietly , she said , " I do n't know what you do to me . I 'm shaking like an ingenue making her first entrance . I ca n't drink this coffee . I do n't want anything more . " A long pause . " Would you escort me up to my rooms ? " " Yes . Gladly . " And so , much sooner than he 'd ever anticipated , it happened to them , in the small bedroom dimly lit by gaslight from the adjoining sitting room . She moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strewing clothes everywhere . While she unpinned her silver-and-gold hair and shook it out , Charles gently , carefullytouched one small , firm breast , then the other . " Oh , I 'm so glad there 's you in this world , Charles , " she said , moving beneath him , drawing him down . She ran her palm round and round on his chest , kissed his throat , sought his mouth . He felt tears of happiness on her cheeks . " I 'm not altogether a scarlet woman , " she whispered . " There 's been but one other man , and that only twice , from curiosity . Each time was a botch , so I 'm not experienced . I hope this ? " " Hush , " he said , kissing her . " Hush . " She was soft and thick and golden where he entered her . She arched high as they found the rhythm together . Her heels and calves held him , and he lost every worry about entanglements and their consequences . He thought of nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman who inspired him to love with all of his body and mind. 222 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 223Abruptly , wakefulness returned . He did n't know where he was . He thrashed ; turned ; saw the gaslit sitting room through the half-open door . His movement roused her . " Are you all right ? " " I was caught in a dream . " Tenderly , she brought her naked warmth against his side . Kissed his shoulder . " Was it bad ? " " I think so . It 's slipped away already . " After a pause she said , " You called out several times . A name . " Another pause . " Not mine . " Upset , he struggled up on his elbow . " No , no , " she said . " It 's all right , Charles . You need to talk about it . There 's something I need to talk about , too . Tomorrow , " she murmured , drawing his back against her bare breasts , reaching over to close and softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of propriety , he dressed and left the hotel . He walked boldly , even noisily , from the staircase to the lobby doors . The clerk , leaning on his palm , opened one eye . Because Charles acted as though he had nothing to hide , the clerk immediately went back to dozing . Charles took a room at a cheaper hotel and next morning called for Willa with a rented buggy . She 'd packed a lunch hamper . They drove into the country upriver , settling down to picnic in a pretty grove of elms and sycamores , many with wild bittersweettwined around their trunks . The grove smelled of the mint growing there . In the sunlit field just to the north , wild asters and bloodroot and jack-in-the-pulpit grew amid stands of nettle and poison ivy . " An embarrassing question , " Charles said as he helped unpackthe hamper : thick summer sausage rounds between pumpernickelfresh from one of the local German bakeries , a corked jug of foamy ginger beer . " Last night , was my beard ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nettles over there , " she said , teasing . " Notice all this extra face powder ? You left indelible evidence of our scandalous behavior . " She leaned close , kissed him lightly . " Which I thoroughly enjoyed and do not in the least regret . Now ? " She spread a checked cloth in the shade . The buggy horse switched his tail todrive off flies . A stately stern wheeler appeared in the north , bound for St. Louis . " I want to tell you something , so that we have no secrets . I did n't come to Sam 's theater entirely by choice , though now I 'm very glad that I did . I was running away from a man named Claudius Wood . " She told the story of New York , the Macbeth dagger , Edwin Booth 's kindness . It put him sufficiently at ease so that he could tell her about Augusta Barclay , that they were lovers but never married . He did hedge the ending a bit , merely saying the war separated them before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation , to spare her loss and emotional pain if he were killed . Ironically , he was the one left grieving , and wary of another involvement . And yet here he wasWhile they finished their picnic the sun 's angle changed . The Mississippi flowed quietly again , the stern wheeler 's wake completelygone . The grove grew warm . Sweat ran down the neck of Charles 's open shirt . Willa invited him to put his head in her lap and rest . He asked her permission to smoke a cigar , lit it , then said , " Tell me who you really are , Willa . Tell me what you like and what you do n't . " She thought a bit , gently caressing his beard . " I like early mornings . I like the way my face feels after I scrub it . I like the sight of children sleeping , and I like the taste of wild berries . I like Edgar Poe 's verse and Shakespeare 's comedians . Parades . The sea . And I 'm shamelessly in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent to kiss his brow . " I 've just discoveredI like sleeping with my arms around a man , though not just any man . As for things I do n't lik  --  ell , stupidity . Needless unkindness in a world already hard enough . Pomposity . People with money who think that money alone makes a person worthy . But most of all " ? another soft kiss ? " I like you . I think I love you . There , I 've let down the mask Pa taught me to keep in place so there 'd be fewer wounds from life . I think I loved you the moment I saw you . " His eyes on the river , he said nothing . He felt as if he teeteredon the edge of a vast abyss , about to fall . They kissed , murmured things , fondled one another , till her224 HEAVEN AND HELL 1 A Winter Count 225sweet breath grew warm as the brilliant summer day . " Love me , Charles , " she said , mouth on his ear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once is fairly safe , bu  --  hat if I got you with child ? " " What a strange man you are . So many would n't even worry . There are far worse things . I 'd not trap you with a baby . " She saw his reaction . " That bothers you . " " Scares me . I could n't stand to lose someone else I cared about . Once was enough . " " So better not to care ? " " I did n't say that . " " Well , no guilt feelings . Whatever happens , happens just for the moment . " Again she kissed him . Even as he bore her gently backward to the soft mat of browned grass and fallen sycamore leaves , he knew that they had gone too far for either of them to escape without hurt . Except when she was rehearsing or performing , they spent every hour of the next four days together . He related his experiences with the Jackson Trading Company ; what he 'd learned of the ways of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to admire leaders such as Black Kettle . She was pleased he 'd moved away from the typical white man 's truculence , an attitude born of greed , mistrust , and , she suspected , general ignorance of the Indians and their concerns . " We always fear what we do n't understand , " she said . They found a photographer 's gallery and sat for a portrait . Willa giggled when the fussy man tightened her head clamp behind the velvet settee . " Look pleasan  --  leasant ! " the man cried from underneath the black camera drape . Standing at her side , Charles rested his hand on her shoulder and adopted a severe expression . Willa kept giggling , from nervousness and joy , and the photographer waited ten minutes until she calmed down . She wanted to know what sort of man he was , what he liked . Lying in bed with her after the Saturday night performance of Richard III , he thought a while and said : " I like horses , good cigars , sunset with a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  o painter ever put sucha blue on canvas . I like the clear air in Texas after a hard rain . In fact I like all of the West that I 've seen . " I like the strength you find in most black people . They 're survivors , fighters . Yankees would n't believe a Southerner saying that . " I love my family . I love my son . I love my best friend , Billy , who 's gone to California with his wife , my cousin . " I hated the last two years of the war and what they did to people , me included . I hate the politicians and the parlor patriots who thumped the tub until the fighting started . They never had to live through days and nights of battl  --  he grimmest , most draining work I 've ever done . They never had to advance through an open meadow toward enemy entrenchments , watching their friends fall around them , and pissing their pants with fea  --  xcuseme , " he said , his voice all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . " It 's all right . I 'd like to meet your son . Would you let me visit Fort Leavenworth ? I could come on a Missouri steamer , perhaps in August . August is a theater 's worst month . I 'm sure Sam would let an understudy replace me . " Fearing the entanglement , he still said , " I 'd like that . " The day after , he hugged and kissed her at the stage door , and then mounted Satan . America 's Ace of Players appeared suddenly , shooing Willa inside so he could speak privately . Trump stepped close to the frisky piebald . " What I have to say is quite simple , sir . You may have the idea that because I am a play actor , I am an effete weakling . To the contrary . I am but fifty , in my prime , and strong . " He raised his fist and forearm at a right angle . Charles might have laughed but for the severity of the actor 's expression . Trump grasped Satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. Main . A marble statue could see that . Well and good . She 's a splendid gir  --  nd like my own daughter . So if you trifle with he  --  f you should in any way hurt he  --  s God is my witness " ? he . exhibited his fist again ? " I will grind you down , sir . I will find you and grind you down . " " I do n't intend to hurt her , Mr. Trump . " The actor released the headstall . " Then a safe journey to you . With my blessing . " 226 HEAVEN AND HELLBut he would have to hurt her in some way , Charles realized as he cantered west from the city . He was in love with her , and confused about it ; vaguely angry that he 'd let it go so far , . wanted it to go that far . But he had . So he had to undo it , and soon. 22When Charles reached Fort Leavenworth , Duncan told him that in late July , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiments from ninteen to forty-five and , of more pertinenceon the Plains , where distances were vast , the number of cavalry regiments from six to ten . The brigadier , who now wore the olive-green trim of the divisional paymaster 's department , was excited about the news . " It means that by next year we 'll be able to demonstrate in force against the hostiles . " Charles chewed an unlit cigar and said nothing . Like Sherman , Jack Duncan believed the tribes must inevitably be driven onto reservations if the West was to be made safe for white settlersand commerce . Duncan saw nothing improper in this appropriationof Indian land , and Charles knew he could n't change Duncan 's mind , so he did n't try . Instead , he announced Willa 's forthcoming visit . " Ah , " Duncan said , smiling . " What does that mea  --  h ? She is n't coming just to see me . She wants to look over halls that the company could rent for a tour . " " Oh , of course , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react to teasing . Perhaps the young man was recoveringfrom the despondency that had haunted him for so long . Willa arrived in late August . She had already visited City of Kansa  --  ome were calling it Kansas Cit  --  n the opposite shore of the Missouri , and Leavenworth on the near side . She said Frank 's Hall in City of Kansas was an ideal auditorium . Duncan 's frame residence on officers ' row , on the north side228 HEAVEN AND HELL of the parade ground , contained an extra room Maureen used . She kept little Gus there in a homemade rocker-crib . She invited Willa to share her bed and the young actress accepted without hesitation . Maureen approved of Willa 's adaptability , and in fact she did fit in well . She chatted easily about Sam Trump and the playhouse , and listened attentively to talk of Army life and the Indian problem . She did n't conceal that she stood with the Indi- ansagainst the great majority of settlers and Army professionals . It did n't nettle Duncan as badly as Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly respected her as an intel- ligent adversary . The first evening , after the women retired ; Duncan poured two whiskeys in the parlor . The open window brought in strong , sweet yeast fumes from the post bakery nearby . For a few min- utes , Duncan complained about the paymaster 's department . It was thankless work ; the officers who rode from fort to fort with soldiers ' wages could never travel fast enough to please the men . Presently he said , " That 's a fine young woman . A bit free- thinking , to be sure . But she 'd make a splendid ? " " Friend , " Charles said , and bit down on his cigar . " Exactly . " Duncan decided not to push Willa 's cause fur- ther at the moment . Charles looked fierce . He might not be as ready to resume normal life as Duncan had thought . Where oaks and cottonwoods shaded the bluff above the fort 's steamboat landing , Charles and Willa went walking on the last day of her visit . Gus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world from his perch . Pleasant sounds drifted through the Sunday air : yells and cheers of soldiers playing base- ball ; the chug of the post steam engine pumping water . Willa was nervous and a little unhappy . Here at the fort , Charles was less demonstrative than he 'd been in St. Louis . She was in love with hi  --  here was no escaping tha  --  ut she knew she 'd better not say it too often . The bleak , exhausted look that showed in his eyes occasionally said he was n't ready for an emo- tional commitment . Still , she could n't bring herself to pretend disinterest . So amid the dapple of sun and the shadows of reddening leaves stirring in the breeze , she took Charles 's son in her arms . There he rested contentedly , gazing over her shoulder at squirrels rac- ing along tree limbs or picking up decaying green hickory nuts that had fallen in midsummer . " Gus is a wonderful boy , " she said . " You and his mother brought a fine son into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pockets , Charles stared at the glintingriver a hundred and fifty feet below them . Common sense toldWilla she should n't press . But she loved him so much " This has been a grand visit . I hope I 'll be invited again . " " Certainly , if it 's convenient for you . " Gus laid his head on Willa 's shoulder and put his thumb in his mouth . His eyes closed and his face softened , blissful . Willa touched Charles 's sleeve . " You 're treating me as though we just met . " He frowned . " I do n't mean to , Willa . It 's just that I get the feeling Jack and Maureen are bot  --  el  --  ushing us together . That 's no good . Week after next , I 'm going out to meet Wooden Foot at Fort Riley . I 've said it before : trading is n't the safest work , even though most of the Southern Cheyennes are my partner'sfriends . I do n't want to get involved . Suppose we went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fair to you . " Her blue eyes snapped . " Oh , come , Charles . Life 's always full of risks like that . Who are you really sparing , me or your-self ? " He faced her . " All right . Myself . I do n't want to go through what I went through before . " " You think I 'm delicate ? Sickly ? That I 'm going to collapse tomorrow , and you 'll lose me ? By the way , I 'm not pregnant . " Her use of that generally unmentionable word startled him . " I 'll be around for a good long while yet . Your excuse wo n't wash . " " I ca n't help it . " And I thought women were the fickle sex . " He turned away , staring upriver again . The cool breeze flutteredhis beard . The low-slanting sun lit Willa 's hair till it shone like fine white gold . " Charles , what in God 's name did the war do to you ? " He did n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " We can be friends casual lover  --  ut nothing else ? " He looked at her . " Yes . " " I 'm not sure how I feel about that . I 'm not sure I like it . I 'll tell you when you come back from this next trip . Now , if you230 HEAVEN AND HELLdo n't mind , I 'd like to go back to the brigadier 's quarters . It 's gotten chilly . " She lifted Gus and handed him to his father , and walked away . She knew that a display of temper would probably drive him off . Yet she could n't do anything about it . She was angry at her untouchable enem  --  he pain left in him by the death of the boy 's mother . Reason , even affection , might never overcome something so deeply wounding . How could she fight it ? Only by hanging on . By demonstrating that Charles could love her withoutrisk , though not without commitment . She hated for the visit to end on a dismal note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer landing , he kissed her cheek , well away from her mouth . He said nothing about visiting St. Louis in the spring , only thanked her for coming . As she went aboard the stern wheeler , little Gus waved and waved . The steamer churned into the current and Willa watched man and boy grow smaller . Charles looked unhappy and confused . That was exactly how she felt . But she could n't deny that she was in love . So she would n't give up . It was going to be a long winter . As August dwindled away , Charles grew impatient to be moving . He left a day early , and no regrets about it , except for Gus . The boy now called him Fa , and readily came to him for hugs or sympathy . Charles was sad that the whole process of getting reacquainted would have to be repeated next spring . As for Willa , he tried to suppress his feelings for her , hopeful that he 'd made it clear that any closer involvement was impossible . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . Maureen 's final word was a tart , " You ought to marry that girl , sir . She said there 's no longer a Mr. Parker , and she 's a grand person . " Rather abruptly , Charles said , " Traders do n't make good family men . " He did n't get as far as he 'd planned the first day . In midafternoon , passing through the Salt Creek Valley , Kickapoo Township , Satan threw a shoe . By the time a local blacksmith replaced it the sun was going down . Charles put up at the Golden Rule House , a place Duncan had talked about with enthusiasm : A Winter Count 231 " It 's only been open a short time but it 's already famous up and down the river . The proprietor 's a generous young fellow . He 'll cut the price of your meal and pour whiskey free if he 's had a few himself . If he keeps on , he 'll go bankrupt . But it 's wonderfulwhile it lasts . " So it proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convivial . The owner , though just twenty , was one of those authentic characters who gave the West its flavor . Already well under the influence by six o'clock , the young Kansan regaled his guests with a long story about driving an Overland coach and suddenly being attacked by a huge band of Sioux . He claimed he drove them off with a combination of shouted threats and rifle fire , saving coach and passengers . Charles shared a table with a huge , amiable man about his own age , who introduced himself as Henry Griffenstein . He said he hailed from one of the German settlements in the upland section of Missouri known as the Little Rhineland . " That 's why I 'm Dutch Henry to my friends . Right now I 'm bullwhacking wagons to Santa Fe . Who knows what I 'll be doing next year ? " Charles chewed a chunk of buffalo steak , then pointed his fork at the talkative young man tending bar . " I do n't think I believe that story . Especially the number of Sioux he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Damn fine stage driver , too , " Dutch Henry said . " Besides that , he 's handled freight wagons and scouted for the Army . He rode Pony Express at fourtee  --  e says . " " How 'd he get in the hotel business ? " " He and Louisa opened the place after they got hitched in January . I do n't think he can last cooped up like this . He 's too full of ginger . Not to mention the gift of gab . " " Gather ' round , boys , " the young man shouted , waving his customers in . " I want to tell you about riding with the Seventh Kansas Cavalry in the war . Jennison 's Jayhawkers . Real hard cases . W  --  ait , let 's all have a refill first . " He poured generous drinks for his listeners , wobbling noticeablyas he did so . From the way he knocked back his whiskey , Charles judged him to be something of a hard case himself . " What 'd you say his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cody . Will F. Cody. " 232 HEAVEN AND HELL I , A Winter Count 233On horseback with their pack mules in single file , the JacksonTrading Company rode over the autumn prairie , bound for the land beyond the hazy blue horizon to the south . They rode beside the same trampled buffalo trail they 'd followed to Indian Territory the year before . In the northwest , dark gray clouds raced toward the apex of the sky . Every half minute or so the clouds lit up , white within . Above the traders a hawk rode the air currents . Red-tailed and dusky gray of body , she sank and soared in great spirals , her heavy wings spread to their full fifty inches . Charles alternately watched the hawk and the storm clouds . Wooden Foot said the hawk was looking for mice and gophers , either of which she could see from high above . Suddenly the hawk turned , flexed her wings hard and flew straight away into the rough air beginning to blow out of the north . Charles wondered if something had alarmed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead was that of a series of continual rises , none higher than six feet . It was late afternoon . At about the same hour two days ago , they 'd crossed the Smoky Hill Road , on which wagons still creaked west with as much speed as their drivers could manage , smelling winterin the crisp September air . At Fort Riley , an officer had told Charles that something like a hundred thousand emigrant wagonshad traveled through during the summer . You would n't know it here . They 'd ridden past an isolated farm at sunset yesterday . Two youngsters had waved at them from the feed lot , and Boy had laughed and gurgled long after the children were left behind . They 'd seen no human beings since . In an old Harper 's Weekly picked up at Riley , Charles had read an amazing article about the great mountain chain of Asia , the Himalayas . " Special from New Delhi by Our Roving Correspondent . " He was fascinated by the description of that remote region , which surely could n't be emptier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wind picked up . High as Satan 's knees , the dry , brittle grama grass seethed . It struck Charles that the piebald was nervous . The other animals were too including Fen . The border colliekept running in circles ahead of them , barking . The dog loped away down the other side of the next rise and disappeared . Only the disturbed motion of the grass marked histrail . Charles studied the sky again . " I wonder why that hawk all of a sudden ? " He stopped , noticing more agitation in the grass . It rippled as though an invisible man was rushing toward them , creating a path but remaining unseen . " It 's Fen , " Wooden Foot said above the whistling wind . " Wonder what the devil 's biting him ? " He reached for his rifle scabbard . " Boy , stick close . " Boy nudged his horse toward the trader 's . " I 'll have a look , " Charles said , touching Satan with his boot heels . The piebald trotted about fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of windblown grass flew into Charles 's eyes . He squinted and shielded his eyes with his hand as he topped the rise . At the bottom , a line of nine men sat on ponies , waiting . From the center of the line Scar gazed up at him . He and the others wore leggings painted with red stripes , and red paint on their faces , arms , and bare chests . Each wore the Dog Society cap , with a narrow beaded band and feathers from a golden eagle and a raven ; the feathers were gathered and tied so they stood up straight . Each man had an eagle-bone whistle on a thong around his neck and carried bow and arrow plus a trade rifle or musket . It was full war regalia . Scar saw that register on Charles 's face . He grinned and pumped his rifle up and down . The others barked and howled . . Wooden Foot and Boy came riding up behind Charles . " Oh my God , Charlie , this is it . This ai n't no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He 's been waitin ' all summer . He knew we 'd prob'ly come back this way . " Charles started to ask whether they should signal for a parley . The fiery spurt and bang of an Indian rifle made the very idea foolish . THE PRESIDENT 'S TOUR . On the Way from Buffaloto Cleveland. 234 HEAVEN AND HELL A Winter Count 235A Joyful Good-Speed by theBuffalonians . Enthusiastic Demonstrations atSilver Creek and Erie .

Judith said C. is praising the President ever since he decided to retaliate for his legislative defeats by taking his case to the people . Johnson presently making what he calls " a swing around the circle , " with Grant and other generals and dignitaries in tow . Andrew Johnson and his entourage invaded Ohio , the home state of Ben Wade , Stanley 's powerful friend and sometime benefactor . At Cleveland , a major stop , a large and friendly crowd greeted the presidential party at the depot . Outside , a specialdecorative arch over the street expressed support for the visit . THE CONSTITUTION , it said . WASHINGTON ESTABLISHED IT . LINCOLNDEFENDED IT . JOHNSON WILL PRESERVE IT . Johnson was pleased . From that point , matters began to deteriorate . At dusk , the Boy General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Seward . The Secretary'sneck still bore red scars from the knife attack of one of John Wilkes Booth 's fellow conspirators , who had struck at Seward on the same night that Lincoln was shot . The Boy General was nervous . This was Ben Wade 's fiefdom ; Radical country . The President had taken to the rails for the avowed purpose of laying the cornerstone of a Stephen Douglasmemorial in Chicago . Actually he was stopping along the way to attack the Republicans . The strategy might have worked had not a large press contingent , including Mr. Gobright of the Associated Press , decided to accompany the President . The reporters wanted to file a new dispatch at every stop , so it was impossible for Johnson to deliver one prepared speech time after time . He was forced to do what he did so badl  --  xtemporize . The Boy General 's tension was reflected in his bouncing stride and darting blue eyes . Lean , with an aura of high energy , George Armstrong Custer wore a trim civilian suit that showed his slimness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libbie urged him to wear spurs to remind people of his war exploits . For a while , because of those exploits , he 'd been the talk of the countr  --  n audacious cavalry general with a remarkable talent for victory . Custer 's luck , someone had christened it . Like some magic dust , it had covered him all during the war , bringing him success in the field and fame in the press . Then came peace , the shrinking Army , and obscurity again . When he mustered out in Texas some months ago , he 'd held the rank of captain . Now he was beginning a slow and deliberate journey back to prominence . In a crucial meeting with Secretary of War Stanton he 'd secured a captaincy for his loyal brother Tom , and for himself a lieutenant colonelcy in one of the new Plains regiments . He would soon return to active duty with the Seventh Cavalry. 236 HEAVEN AND HELL , L A Winter Count 237He considered it a fine opportunity because the Seventh 's commander , General Andrew Jackson Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exceedingly vain man . Smith also had responsibility for the entire district of the Upper Arkansas , so Custer assumed that day-to-day command of the Seventh would fall to him . That was ideal for making the regiment his own , in spirit if not in fact . He did n't regard the Seventh as a final stopping point , however . Politicians were already promoting Grant as a candidate for President , and Libbie Custer had focused her husband 's eye on that same high office . He was fascinated , but he and Libbie agreed that he needed some spectacular military achievement to propel him to eminence again . Meantime , he could polish his reputation by making this swing with Johnson . Or so he 'd thought at the beginning ; now the trip was turning out quite badly . Custer 's long wavy curls bounced on his shoulders and his glance leaped ahead to the open doors of a parlor . He spied SecretaryWelles , Admiral Farragut , and other dignitaries . Grant had hurried on to Detroit , pleading indisposition . Privately , Custer believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors of trouble in Cleveland . The twenty-seven-year-old soldier hoped the rumors were false . Ohio was his native state , and he 'd gotten behind Johnson because he always liked Southerners , even when he fought them . He 'd flatly refused a command in one of the new colored regiments , the Ninth , and he believed that if the Republican Party could thrive only with the votes of ex-slaves , it should die . Nearing the parlor doors , Custer said to Seward , " Do you think the President should be cautioned again , Mr. Secretary ? Reminded of Senator Doolittle 's warning ? " In a confidential memo , Doolittle had said that Johnson 's enemies never gained advantage from his written opinions , only from his spontaneous answers to questions or heckling . " I do , George . I 'll take care of it , " Seward said . They entered the parlor . Fashionably dressed men and women surrounded the President and a young woman who resembledhi  --  rs . Martha Patterson , his daughter . She traveled as Johnson 's hostess because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seward slipped in close to the President , Custer circledto the French windows . He studied the crowd below . Aboutthree hundred and growing , he estimated . He listened to its communalvoice . Noisy , but not particularly cheerful . People at the depot had laughed a lot . He stepped into the center of the balcony doorway . As he expected , it got a reaction . " There 's Custer ! " That produced some whistles and applause . He started to wave , but checked when he heard booing . His normally ruddy face darkened and he quickly stepped back into the parlor . Perhapshe ought to leave town , as Grant had . Libbie swooped into the room , drawing attention as she always did . What a lovely creature he 'd married , he thought , going to her . Vivid dark eyes , full bosom , the kind of tiny waist other women envied . She took his arm and whispered , " How is the crowd , Au-tie ? " " Not friendly . If he does anything more than thank them , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife to the large group . " Mr. President , " he said , with warmth . " Good evening . " The crowd in St. Clair Street was growing impatient . Chineselanterns across the front of the Kennard Hotel cast a sickly pale light on the upturned faces . Ugly faces , many of them , revealingthe ugly tempers beneath . A man at the back of the crowd observed the people carefully . He wore a shabby overcoat and a Union campaign hat with the crossed metal cannon of the artillery . Another man slipped up beside him . " Everyone 's in place , " the second man said . " Good . I trust they know what to do . " " I went over it ' fore I paid them . " Secretary Seward appeared on the balcony and introduced the President . The stocky , swarthy Andrew Johnson walked out and raised his hands to acknowledge the scanty applause . " My friends and constituents , thank you for your generous welcome to Cleveland . It is not my intention to make a speech ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiot nearly alwayssaid that , throwing his audiences an obvious cue . One of the hired men took it . " Then do n't . " Laughter .

" " I regret that General Grant is unable to appear with me . He ? " Groans covered the rest . " Why do n't you want colored men to vote in Dixie ? " someoneyelled . Seward touched Johnson 's sleeve to caution him . The Presidentpulled his arm away . " Cast the mote from your own eye before you worry about your neighbor 's , " he cried . " Let your own Negroes vote here in Ohio before you campaign to extend the franchise down South . " The voices began a crescendo from various points in the crowd : " You 're spineless . " " Prison 's too good for Jeff Davis ! " " Hang him . Hang him ! " Johnson exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Loud booing , which only goaded the President .

Johnson was in a fury , and the reporters would have every word of the debacle on the telegraph wire by midnight . Johnson foolishly thought he could attack Wade with impunity .

Des LaMotte , reduced to their level because there were still no fine families to employ him , carried two . He worked in gentleman 's linen breeches , soiled and torn . He balanced a keg on each shoulder . When he first tried it , the rims left red welts that later bled . Now a ridge of scar tissue had toughened both shoulders .

On his second day , he 'd almost knocked down a darky who approached him about joining a new Longshoremen 's Protective Association . The man opened his appeal with remarks about a burial aid fund , so much contributedeach week to guarantee that funeral expenses would be met when necessary . When Des heard that , his mind flashed white . He quelled his murderous impulses but could n't banish them . How could the ignorant African understand the depth and subtlety of Des 's affection for his wife , Sally Sue , or his commander , Ferris Brixham ?

In the hot sunshine of a Carolina autumn that was more like summer , he sweated rivers of salt sweat as he labored up the plank of the coastal steamer Sequoiah again and yet again , musclestwisting like ropes under his raw-burned skin . He allowed none of his pain to show on his face . More than pain and the tiny Low Country gnats deviled him this morning . He 'd received a note from Gettys . It said that CaptainJolly , the trash they planned to employ to pull the trigger on Madeline Main , had filled himself with stolen corn whiskey , then gone off to try to wreck the school . Idiot , Des thought , simmering . He heaved a keg to his right shoulder , and then another to his left . His knees buckled a little as he absorbed the weight .

Some hot night , inflamed by spiritous liquors and the agents of the Yankee government , the freedmen would go wild . There would be arson , rapine , hell to pay for any man with white skin . Such an outbreak was the sort of screen he needed . And now Jolly had drawn attention to himself , and to Mont Royal . Jolly was accustomed to doing whatever he pleased , terrorizingboth whites and niggers in the Ashley district . Well , he would n't do as he pleased with the Main woman . Des had alreadysent off a reply to Gettys demanding that Jolly be restraineduntil ordered to act . Groaning and sweating , Des bent his back and struggled up the plank step by painful step .

Boy , upset by the sudden attack , vainly tried to control the pack mules from horseback . " Get down , get off your horse , " Charles shouted . The Cheyennesrushed their ponies up the rise . A bullet snapped Charles 's hat brim ; the hat sailed away . He yelled at Boy again but the howls of the Indians and the bray of the mules competed . But after a few seconds , Boy understood the look on Charles 's face and slipped clumsily to the ground . Wooden Foot knelt and shot at the Cheyennes nearing the top of the rise . He missed . Charles fired as the brave next to Scar flung a feathered lance . Charles dodged it . The Indian took Charles 's bullet , blasted off his pony . Everything was noise and confusion . A few miles west , lightningsizzled down from approaching storm clouds and struck the dry prairie . The grass smoked and sparked . Boiling , tumbling , the black clouds sped on toward the Cheyennes and the embattledtraders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reddenedsleeve . A lance had grazed him . Tears of pain and bewildermentrolled down his face . Wooden Foot shouted , " Behind you , Charlie , " and fired his long gun almost simultaneously . Charles pivoted and saw a mounted Cheyenne about to hammer him with a stone-headed war club . Charles shot at the red-painted face , but not soon enough to stop the blow . The club pounded his shoulder with anA Winter Count 245impact that drove him sideways . The Cheyenne sagged from his pony , his face a sheet of blood . The storm clouds passed over like a lid closing on the world . Thunder rolled . Lightning glittered . On the wind from the west , Charles smelled smoke . He saw Scar jabbing at Wooden Foot with his lance , from horseback . The Cheyennes crowded their ponies in close , though with less zeal since a couple of their own had fallen . Wooden Foot dodged back ; Scar 's thrust missed . He thrust again . The trader gripped his rifle with both hands and used it like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charles levered a round into the Spencer , aimed at Scar , and pulled the trigger . The rifle jammed . Another Cheyenne rode by and lanced Charles 's right arm . A rush of blood followed the hot pain . He dropped the Spencer , yanked out his Bowie , and drove the blade into the Indian 's side . The Indian screamed and jerked forward over his pony 's neck . The pony raced away , taking the Indian and the protruding steel too . Determined to finish Wooden Foot , Scar worked his pony in again . Wooden Foot blocked his thrusts expertly with his rifle . Scar 's face showed his frustration . The struggle was taking a toll on Wooden Foot , though . His cheeks were dark as plums . Charles found himself momentarily free of adversaries . Then he saw why . Three Cheyennes were riding down on the mules and Boy . Weeping , the youngster struck at them feebly , as if swatting flies . One brave jumped down and grabbed Boy . Fen leaped from concealment in the grass as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheyenne 's forearm . Another Indian beat at the dog with the butt of his trade rifle . Amid the buffeting of the gale wind , the white flashing of the lightning , Wooden Foot uttered a strange choked cry . Drawing his Colt and dodging as a Cheyenne shot at him , Charles saw his partner lurch sideways in the high grass . Wooden Foot gasped , as if he could n't get air . He plucked the front of his beaded shirt as if to tear something out . Charles remembered seeing Wooden Foot 's face flushed the same way before . " It ai n't nothing ? " But it was : a heart seizure , brought on by the enormous strain of the attack . Scar had his hatchet in hand , raised high . Charles fired . The prancing of Scar 's pony caused the bullet to miss the target and246 HEAVEN AND HELL ping the hatchet blade . Charles jumped in front of Wooden Foot to shoot again . Scar quickly trotted away down the rise , bent low over his pony . Blood leaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wordless raw cry of rage , because two things demanded attention at once : Wooden Foot , kneading his shirt with both hands and trying to get air in his lungs , and three dismounted Cheyennes who were dragging Boy out of sight beyond another part of the rise . Fen chased after them , foam flying from his jaws . Wooden Foot 's fingers clawed beads loose from his shirt . They sparkled and winked in the lightning glare . Charles could n't help both of them . He chose the one visibly near and in peril of instant death . Wooden Foot swayed backward . Charles caught him with his left hand while firing at the nearest Cheyenne with his right . Because of his wound , his gun arm throbbed and shook . His bullet sped yards wide of the target . The Cheyennes were going to finish them , so all Charles could do was go out fighting . He knelt and worked his knee under his partner 's sagging back . The trader braced there , his eyes wide , his limp hands falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color leach from his face . Wooden Foot recognized his partner . He tried to touch Charles but could n't lift his hand . Beyond the rise , Fen abruptly stopped barking , then yelped once . Charles put his ear near Wooden Foot 's mouth . He thought he heard , " Thanks for all ? " Bright lightning whited out every- thing . When he recovered his sight he almost cried . Wooden Foot 's eyes were still open but nothing lived behind them . From over the rise the three Cheyennes appeared and recap- tured their ponies . They trotted down toward Scar , who was waiting at the spot where Charles had first seen the Indians . Charles raced toward the place where Boy had disappeared . As he ran , the storm threw bits of grass and particles of dirt into his eyes . When Scar saw Charles move away from Wooden Foot 's body , he signaled his remaining cohorts to ride toward it . Charles passed two fallen pack mules bleeding to death from bullet wounds . Lightning blazed . The ground rocked under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire spring up behind him , where lightning had struck again . " Boy ? " he shouted , struggling up the rise on legs shaking with weakness . " Boy , answer me . " The lightning answered , a scorching sizzling swordstroke straight down into the hollow between rises , the place the three dismounted Cheyennes had just quitted . Grass smoked , glowed orange , then burst into flame . Godamighty , the end of the world , Charles thought as he stumbled down the slope toward a dry stream bed . On the near side , trampled grass glistened wet and black . Amidst that blood lay something as shapeless as a potato sack . Over the rise behind him , flames six feet high burned in a rampart of scarlet , orange , white . The rampart spread forward and backward and sideways simultaneously . Once in Texas he 'd seen a similar prairie fire . It destroyed forty square miles . He reached the shapeless thing and gazed down , driven past feeling by shock . Boy lay with his sadly swollen head resting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open from throat to groin . From the chest cavity already swarming with flies protrudedthe remains of Fen . A leg , the bone visible in bloody fur ; part of the collie 's snout and skull , including an eye . Other pieces were strewn on the glistening grass . Charles stared at the butchery no more than five seconds , but it might as well have been a century . Finally he turned and started back up the rise and the fire rampart behind it . Wooden Foot 's dead , Boy 's dead , he thought . I 'll go next but I 've got to take that scarred bastard with me . From the rise he saw Scar and five others sitting their ponies some distance away , appearing and disappearing behind the blowing smoke . The Cheyennes had shifted slightly to the south of their original position and despite the smoke , Charles recognizedsomething new on their faces : apprehension ; or at least doubt . The fire had advanced nearly halfway up the rise where the Jackson Trading Company had made its futile stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place he 'd left Wooden Foot . It 's Sharpsburg all over again , he thought . It 's Northern Virginia all over again . Behind fuming smoke , Scar smiled . Charles wondered about that as he staggered to Wooden Foot 's corpse . Looking down , he choked . His partner 's pale body lay denuded of clothing . A red hole between the legs crawled with flies . Bloody genitals had been forced into Wooden Foot 's mouth . On his eyes the Cheyennes had poured little mounds of diamond and triangle pony beads . The fire made them sparkle . Scar had a fine touch when it came to barbarity . " You bastards , " Charles screamed . " You filthy , inhuman bastards . " Scar stopped smiling . Charles pointed his Colt at the Cheyenneleader , steadying it with bloody hands . Smoke thickened , hiding Scar and the others . Charles squeezed off a round . Another . Another . Until the cylinder emptied . By then the wall of smoke and fire completely hid the Cheyennes . To reach Charles they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ends that kept extending north and south . Gusty wind blew his hair . The fire roaring on the slope lit his wild face as if it were noonday . The smoke parted again . The Cheyennes were still there . Every one of Charles 's shots had missed . Scar signaled the others to advance . One Cheyenne shook his head , then another . They had no more stomach for the shouting madman on the rise protected by a wall of fire and smoke . Though they did n't understand his words , they understood the meaning of his yelling . " Come on , show me how brave you are ! You killed an old man and a boy and a dog . Let 's see what you can do with me ! " One of the reluctant Cheyennes shook his head again , emphatically . That displeased Scar . He grabbed the last man to shake his head . The Cheyenne knocked Scar 's hand away , turned his mount , and rode off into the stormy darkness . Four others followed in single file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he joined the retreat . " Come back , goddamn it . You yellow sons of bitches ! " The starch went out of him as the fire once more leaped high and hid them . Charles kept yelling at Scar . " You deserve to be wiped off the earth , you and your whole tribe . I 'll find a way , you can count on that . " Count on that . . . count on that . . . He turned and moved from the heat and glare . Using his wounded arm , he tried to jam his Colt into the holster . He kept missing . The gunsight ripped his pants and dug his leg so that it bled . He neither saw nor felt it . From his left hand dangled Wooden Foot 's personal parfleche , which he did n't remember snatching off his partner 's dead horse . The storm front flew on eastward , miles away now . A lightrain started , not strong enough to put out the fire . Charles staggeredamong the dead mules to see what else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive , unhurt . With their reins gathered in his left hand he started back toward the rise . The fire stopped him . The great white-and-scarlet wall now curved across the main rise and around to his right , behind the continuation of the rise shielding the creek bed where Boy and Fen had died . As he watched , the fire completely engulfed the rise where Wooden Foot 's body lay . I ca n't even bury them . At that , he wept tears of wrath . By a lucky chanc  --  is only luck of the da  --  harles found his piebald about two miles northeast of the fire site . He was riding one of the two mules and leading the other . A wide strip of cloth torn from his trousers and twisted with a stick had stopped the bleeding of his right arm . The wound hurt and needed attention , but it was far from fatal . When he came on Satan , standing head down , still as marble except for the movement of his eye , Charles changed mounts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of sorrow and outrage . At dusk he stopped to rest and camp . He built a buffalochipfire , then chewed some pemmican from his own parfleche . Two bites and his belly ached . Four bites , it all came up . After the storm the sky cleared , leaving him huddled in a cold breeze under brilliant stars . Shivering , he opened Wooden Foot 's parfleche . He found the paint pots and the rolled-up wintercount . He untied the thong and spread it at his feet . Although he could n't explain the reason , something compelledhim to try to finish it . He opened the pot of black , moistenedthe brush , dipped it in , and poised it over the pictograph history of the Jackson Trading Company 's final year . He studied the various figures Wooden Foot had painted , including the three of them in the sanctuary of the Buffalo Hat tipi . How he had misunderstood that incident . It had fooled him into believing the Cheyennes were capable of compassion . They were n't . Only the sanctity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cheyennes hated all whites , and never mind if they had reasons .

His bleak face reflecting the campfire , he laboriously painted three exceedingly crude stick figures , a dog and two men . The second figure was to the right and slightly above the first , and the third similarly elevated above the second , as though all stood on an invisible stair . Trying to conceive a way to picture the Hanging Road above the figures , he faltered . Should he paint wavy lines for the Milky Way ? No . Five-pointed stars . He did one , corrected two of the points , then two others , and found himself with a solid blob instead of an open star figure . He flung the brush into the fire , then the paints . He held the edges of the pictograph and studied each image in turn , finally purged of any impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hardened . His own life , which he 'd tried so hard to reconstruct over the past winter , had been destroyed as quickly and surely as the grass in the path of the prairie fire .

They want killing , I 'll give them killing , he thought . I know more about it than they do . I had five hundred thousand expert teachers . The figures on the pictograph blackened and burned while he watched , seeking to remember every fiery image .

The weary sentry stepped into the rain , forcing the rider to halt . A lightning bolt etched the horseman in white . His mustachedrooped and his full , tangled beard needed trimming . A poncho-style garment resembling a patchwork quilt hung from his shoulders . He clenched a cold cigar stub in his teeth . Rain dripped from the bill of the boyish sentry 's cap .

Terrified , the sentry retreated against the guard box . The crotch of his long underwear felt damp suddenly . He waved . " Pass on . " The horseman was already beyond him , at the gallop . The rain beat on the roof . Jack Duncan poured brandy . Charles accepted his drink without a word . The brigadier did n't like that , or the surprise visitor 's filthy appearance , or the haunted fatigue shadows ringing his eyes . Charles had stunned Duncan first by arriving at half past one in the morning , second by announcing that he wanted to join the Army . " I thought you 'd had enough . " 254 HEAVEN AND HELL " No .

He taught me more plaihs craft than I could quote to you in a week . I 'm going to punish the bastards who butchered him . " Duncan 's face , puffy with tiredness , showed his disapproval .

" " I know Grierson 's Sixth Illinois Cavalry . They rode six hundred miles in sixteen days inside the Confederacy to pull Pemberton away while Grant crossed the Mississippi below Vicksburg . That ride was worthy of Jeb Stuart or Wade Hamp- ton . If it 's the same Grierson , he was good enough to be on our side . " It pleased Duncan to see Charles show a trace of sardonic humor . " It 's the same Grierson . He turned into a damn fine cavalryman for a small-town music teacher scared of horses . " " Scared of ? ? " Charles could n't believe it . " True .

Grierson 's men will all be black . " That gave Charles pause . He helped himself to more brandy , thinking hard . Duncan explained that a Ninth Cavalry Regiment was being raised in Phil Sheridan 's Division of the Gulf ; Sherman 's division would get the Tenth . " Grierson told me the recruiters have been able to sign up only one private so far . The War Department insists on white officers , well qualified , but Union veterans who want a commission do n't want one in the Tenth . You know George Custer ? " " I do .

If Griersonwould take you , he could help smooth your way with General Hancock at Division . So could I. " " Could I get a pardon ? " " If you lie about your rank as a scout for Hampton . Scale it down . Say you were an irregular . Are there records to dispute that ? " " Probably not . Most burned up in Richmond , they say . " " Then you should be all right .

I know you 're a fine soldier . But you 're going back for the wrong reason . " " When can I see Grierson ? " " Tomorrow , I suppose . " Duncan cleared his throat , then sniffed with unmistakable meaning . " After you bathe . " Far away , the storm rumbled . Charles smiled . It reminded Duncan of the grimace of a fleshless skull . The Tenth Cavalry had temporary offices in one of the frame buildings housing Department of the Missouri headquarters , on the east side of the parade ground . A middle-aged captain hunched behind the desk with the wary air of a man defending a fortification . Over a wide down-curving mouth drooped a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see him , Ike ? " " Think so , General Duncan . " The captain knocked and stepped into the inner office . Tilting his head toward the closed door , Duncan said to Charles , " Ike 's been in the regulars twenty years . Tough bird . Down at Sabine Crossroads in ' 64 , he helped clear a wagon train blocking the retreat road when Dick Taylor turned back Nate Banks . He was decorated . Couple of months later he was riding for A. J. Smith when old Smitty repulsed Forrest at Tupelo . That action earned him a field commission . " The captain returned , leaving the door open . The brigadier said , " This is my son-in-law , Charles . " They 'd already decided he should keep that part of his name . " Captain Isaac Newton Barnes . Regimental adjutant . " " Acting adjutant , " Barnes said in a pointed way . While Duncan went in and shut the door , Charles said , " Pleasure , sir . " It paid to be respectful to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer . Ike Barnes scowled at the litter of orders , files and reports on his desk . In profile he resembled an  --  ound shoulders , concave lower back , sizable paunch . His right eye cocked slightly .

I 'll get C Company as soon as the colonel finds somebody else stupid enough to get stuck shuffling all these damn papers . " A breathless sergeant dashed in . " Captain ! Two colored boys on the steamboat landing . They 're yours . " " Damn it to hell , Sergeant , you know better than to say colored within a mile of this office . The colonel will not tolerate his regiment being designated the way they were in the war . This is not the Tenth Colored Cavalry , it 's the Tenth Cavalry .

" He 's interested . This time tell the truth , and see if you can work things out . " He punched Charles 's shoulder . " Luck . " Duncan marched toward the outer door and Charles moved to the inner one . As he passed through , Duncan 's image of a man stepping off a precipice flashed through his head . Colonel Benjamin F. Grierson 's huge beard and bold nose lent him a piratical air , enhanced by the facial scar . After inviting Charles to sit , he placed a fresh sheet of paper on his desk near a small gold case holding an ambrotype in an oval matte . Charles presumed the woman to be Grierson 's wife . " I 'll be straightforward , Mr. Main . Your interest in the Tenth raises more than one problem . Before we go into them , I 'd like to know why you 're here . Jack told you that scores of capableofficers in this army detest the idea of Negro regiments . " 258 HEAVEN AND HELL Banditti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I 'm a soldier , and that 's all I am .

" " Not in my regiment , sir , " Grierson said , with a touch of ire . " The Tenth wo n't formulate policy , just carry it out . Our mission from General Sherman is to bolster the military presence on the Plains . It is defensive only . We 're to protect the settlers , the travel routes , the railroad construction crews . We are not to attack unless attacked first . " " Sir , I 'm sorry if I said ? " " Hear me out , sir . Before we can carry out our mission , we must teach city men to march , ride , shoot , and behave in a militarymanner . I 'm talking about unlettered men , Mr. Mai  --  orters , waiters , teamsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a decent career . I fully intend to turn such men into superior soldiers that any commander would be proud to lead . I will do it the way I taught the scales to my beginning music pupils in Illinois . With rigid discipline and constant and relentlessdrill . That will be the responsibility of my officers . They will have no time for personal vendettas . " " I apologize for my remark , sir . I understand what you 're saying . " " Good , " Grierson said . " Otherwise I 'd not waste time on you . " Eyeing Charles in a speculative way , he added , " No , that 's dishonest . I am not interviewing you completely by choice , but rather , because of the dire need I already mentioned . I confess , however , to being somewhat reluctant to recruit a Southerner . " Despite a spurt of resentment , Charles kept still . " You see , Mr. Main , I have a peculiar vision of this country . Peculiar in that it is apparently not shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very few low-rank line commissions . I believe in the exact words of Mr. Jefferson 's declaration that all men are created equal , if not in mind and body and circumstance , then most assuredly in opportunity . I believe we fought the war , whether we realize it or not , in order to extend that vision to the black race . I do know it is n't a popularidea . Many of my fellow officers accuse me o  --  heir words ? niggering them to death . So be it . I believe the vision must prevail first of all in this new regiment . If the regiment wo n't work , then the Army does n't work , America does n't work , nothing works . So my officers must cheerfully bear the extra burden of standing between their men and the extreme hostility and prejudice rampantin the Army . " His stare was unwavering . " You 're from South Carolina . I do n't care about that unless it means you ca n't live by my rules . If you ca n't , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejection , Charles said , " I can , sir . " " You can deal honestly , squarely , with Negro soldiers ? " " I got along well with blacks on the plantation where I wasraised . " The wrong tack again . Grierson waved with bitter scorn . " Bondsmen , Mr. Main . Slaves . Immaterial here . " Charles 's voice hardened a little . " Let me put it another way , sir . No , I wo n't get along with every last man . " Grierson started to retort , but Charles kept on . " I did n't get along with all of the white men in the Wade Hampton Legion or the Second Cavalry in Texas . Every outfit has its share of idiots and berrypickers . I always warned that kind of man once , but only once . If he kept on , I locked him up . If he still kept on , I got him discharged . I 'd behave the same way in the Tenth . " He locked his gaze with Grierson 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly , between the bushy mustacheand luxuriant beard , he flashed a smile . " A good answer . A soldier 's answer . I accept it . Men of the Tenth will be judged on merit , nothing else . " " Yes , sir , " Charles said , though his prompt answer madehim a little uneasy . He was quick to speak because he wanted tojoin a regiment , any regiment , and this one was desperate forofficers . But he had reservations about the ability of city blacks tobecome good soldier  --  xactly the same reservations he 'd hadabout the white flotsam he 'd found at Jefferson Barracks . Thebias probably came from his West Point training , but there it was . Grierson leaned forward . " Mr. Main , I detest liars andcheats and am about to qualify myself as both . You will be required to do the same when the special review board examinesyou . At least one member , Captain Krug , will bore in hard . **25;15389;TOOLONG request permission to cross the line , they might be inclined to let him enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sided with them against some of the prisoners , thought they deserved what they got , the prisoners who were stupid and cruel . He felt his rancor constantly shift , felt secret satisfactions , hated the brig routine , despised the men who could not master it , although he knew it was contrived to defeat them all . When a man was returned to his unit from the chicken-wire enclosure , a man from the cells took his place . When a man in the chicken wire fouled up , he got a cell of his own , C-rats to eat , close and horrendous attention . When a man from the cells fouled up , he was thrown in the hole , a junior-size cell with a dirt floor and a cat hole to crap in . Because of the overcrowding , there was constant shifting of prisoners , many ceremonial occasions at white lines , inspections , friskings , shakedowns , foul-ups . The night of the beating , Dupard had nothing to say , although Ozzie knew he was not asleep . He tried to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Orwell , the territory of no-choice . He could see how he 'd been headed here since the day he was born . The brig was invented just for him . It was just another name for the stunted rooms where he 'd spent his life . He 'd once told Reitmeyer that communism was the one true religion . He was speaking seriously but also for effect . He could enrage Reitmeyer by calling himself an atheist . Reitmeyer thought you had to be forty years old before you could claim that distinction . It was a position you had to earn through years of experience , like winning seniority in the Teamsters . Maybe the brig was a kind of religion too . All prison . Somethingyou carried with you all your life , a counterforce to politics and lies . This went deeper than anything they could tell you fromp101the pulpit . It carried a truth no one could contradict . He 'd been headed here from the start . Inevitable . Trotsky in the Bronx , only blocks away . Maybe what has to happen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must find himself in the stream of nochoice , the single direction . This is what makes things inevitable . You use the restrictions and penalties they invent to make yourself stronger . History means to merge . The purpose of history is to climb out of your own skin . He knew what Trotsky had written , that revolution leads us out of the dark night of the isolated self . We live forever in history , outside ego and id . He was n't sure he knew exactly what the id was but he knew it lay hidden in Hidell . A naked bulb burning in the passageway . He watched Dupard in the shadows , sitting on the infested cot , showing an empty stare . His bony wrists dangled out of the faded shirt . He had a gangliness that made him seem sixteen , rompish and clumsy , but he moved well running  --  running in the compound , running to the head , eyeing those white lines . A long face , hangdog , sad-sack , and dusty hair , reddish brown . Eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay still , aware of a drone in the block , a heaving breath , grimness , massive sleep . Dupard undressed , got under the blanket and began to masturbate , turned toward the wall . Oswald watched his top shoulder twitch . Then he turned to his own wall , closed his eyes , tried to will himself to sleep . Hidell means do n't tell . The id is hell . Jerkle and Hide in their little cell . Oswald stood at the white line in front of the urinal . A guard moved alongside , peering in that inquisitive way , like what do we have here to pass the time . Oswald requested permission to cross the line . " I 'm looking at your hairline , shitbird . What is supposed to be the length of the hair in the area of the nape of the neck ? "  | " Zero length . " " What do I see ? " " I do n't know . " The guard pushed him stumbling across the line . When he turned to recross he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half intelligent , small bright eyes . Oswald turned to face the urinal , requested permission to cross . " I 'm looking at your sideburns . What am I looking at ? " " My sideburns . " " The hair on your sideburns will not exceed what length when fully extended . " " One-eighth inch . " The guard extended the hair between his thumb and index finger , twisting for effect . Oswald let his head lean that way , not so much to ease the pain , which was mild , as to show he would not accept pain stoically in these circumstances . The guard released and then popped him in the head with the heel of his hand . Oswald requested permission to cross the line . " The length of the hair at the top of the head will not exceed how many inches maximum . " " Maximum three inches . " He waited for the guard to grab a handful . " The fly of the trousers shall hang in what kind of line and shall not do what when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers shall hang in a vertical line and shall not gap when they are unzipped . " The guard reached around and grabbed him by the nuts . " I know the type . " " Aye aye sir . " " I spot the type a mile away . " " Aye aye sir . " " The type that ca n't stand pain . " " Aye aye sir . " " The sniveling phony Marine . " A prisoner approached the second white line , requested per/mission to cross . The guard looked over , slowly . He let go of Oswald'scrotch . It was raining again . He detached the billy club from his belt and approached the second prisoner . " What 's your name ? " " Nineteen . " " Do n't you know the code , Nineteen ? " " I requested permission to cross the line . " " You did n't request permission to talk . " The guard jabbed him lightly in the ribs . " Prisoners are silent . We observe the international rules of warfare in this head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say-so . He jabbed the prisoner with the billy club . " Prisoners run silent . They fall to the deck silent when struck . Do you know how to fall , Nineteen ? " The guard jabbed twice , then three more times , harder , before Nineteen realized he was supposed to fall down , which he did , crumpling slowly , in careful stages . His right shoulder touched the white line . The guard kicked him back over . " We observe the principles of night movement in this head . What is the first principle of night movement , Nineteen ? " " Run at night only in an emergency . " The guard swung the club without bothering to lean toward the prisoner , using a casual backhand stroke , grazing the man 's elbow . The guard did not look at the man as he swung . This was one of the features of the local style . The guard looked at Oswald . " Why did I hit him ? " " He recited principle number two . " The guard swung the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this head we know our manual word for word , " the guard told the crumpled man , standing with his back to him . " We say nothing in this head that does not come from the manual . We kill silent and with surprise . " Oswald needed desperately to piss . " In the final assualt , " said the guard , " it is the individualp104Marine , with his rifle and his what , who closes with the enemy and destroys him . " " Bayonet , " the prisoner said . " A vigorous bayonet assault , executed by Marines eager to drive home cold steel , can do what , what , what . " Silence from the man on the deck . He tightened his fetal knot a second before the guard stepped back half a stride and swung the club in a wide arc , striking the knee this time . Oswald was eager to be called . The guard looked at Oswald , who said at once , " A vigorous bayonet assault , executed by Marines eager to drive home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy . " The guard swung the club backwards once more , striking Nineteenon the arm . Oswald felt a slight satisfaction . The guard made a point of gazing into the distance as he struck his blows . Oswald sensed the guard 's interest shift his way . He was ready for the question . " Principle number one . " " Get the blade into the enemy . " " Principle number two . " " Be ruthless , vicious and fast in your attack . " The guard took half a step , switched the billy to his left hand and swung it hard , striking Oswald 's collarbone . He was genuinely surprised . He thought they 'd reached an understanding . The blow knocked him back three steps and forced him to one knee . He 'd thought he was through getting hit for the day . " There are no right answers , " the guard advised , looking into the distance . Oswald got to his feet , approached the white line , stood staring at the urinal . He requested permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " One , assume the guard position . " " Then what . " " Iwo , step forward fifteen inches with the left foot , keeping the right foot in place . "  |p105The  guard swung the club , hitting him in the arm . He was sweaty with the need to piss , his upper body moist and chill . " There are no right answers in this head . It is the stupidest arrogance to give an answer that you think is right . " The guard jabbed him in the ribs with the butt end of the stick . The other man , Nineteen , was still crumpled on the deck . The guard swung the club , smashing Oswald on the upper back . The idea seemed to be why bother with questions . Oswald made a decision to let the piss come flowing out . It was an anger and a compensation . He felt it flow down his leg , knowing deep relief , deliverance , good health everywhere , long life to all . The guard swung the club , hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands over the back of his head , covering up . The last blow put the guard strangely on edge . He stood looking into the distance but was different from before , mouth hanging open , a dead spot in his eye , and Oswald knew they were all one word away from a private carnage of the type you hear about from time to time , nameless and undetailed . He watched the puddle take shape on the floor , his arms crossed at the back of his head . He needed a moment to think . He sighed deeply , stepping up to the white line . He looked straight ahead and lowered his hands slowly to his sides . It was his sense of things that if he moved slowly and openly and did not show terror , the guard would stand off . The guard 's mental condition had to be taken into account . They were all here to see to it that the guard came through . Oswald believed that the man crumpled on the deck knew this as well as he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had to let the moment cohere , build itself back to something they all recognized as a rainy Wednesday in Japan . He stood at the white line and waited . Dupard whispered in the dark . " I definitely get the idea they want to send me home in a box.  |p106The  first minute I put on the green service coat , I look like I 'm dead . It 's a coffin suit for a fool . I seen it on the spot . " " I liked the uniform , " Ozzie told him . " It was great how it looked . I was surprised how great I felt . I kept it cleaned and mothproofed . I kept heavy objects out of the pockets . I looked in the mirror and said it 's me . " " Nice joke . They told my mother . Get him in the service , Mrs. Dupard . The streets of America getting crazy by the day . Your boy is safe with us . " " That 's what they told my mother . " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggers . Believe this booshit ?

" I used to read the manual . I never looked at my schoolbooks but I read the Marine Corps manual . " " Make you a man . " " Then I found out what it 's really all about . How to be a tool of the system . A workable part . It 's the perfect capitalist handbook . " " Be a Marine . " " Orwell means the military mind . The police state is not Russia .

Daily humiliations all her life . This is known as ground down by the system . Except she never questions that . It is only the local conditions . It is Mr. Ekdahl and his puny divorce settlement . It is the whispering behind her back . It is the neighbors with their Hotpoint washers and Ford Fairlane cars , which she competes against the only way she can . " My boy Lee loves to read . " His mother never-ending . Three days running , for no special reason , every meal was rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the chicken wire , turned into the cell block , stopped at the white line . Dupard was in the cell wearing skivvies and sitting on Oswald 's rack . Dupard 's mattress was smoldering . Oswald watched the pale smoke collect in the air . His cellmate just sat there , hangdog , thoughtful , picking at his feet . " Bobby , how come ? " " You want your rack ? " " Stay there . " " We 're not supposed to talk . " " You 're only making things worse . " " I 'm evicting lice , that 's all . They 're boring into my skin . Time to rid the premise , man . " " Did you ask for a new mattress ? " " I axed . They punch my face . " He was calm , a little sullen , mainly thoughtful and resigned . " They 'll only extend your time . " " In my own mind this is nothing to excite themselves . I do n't feel like there 's any guilt to be handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lice on out of here . In other way of saying it , it 's like I 'm doing their job for them . " " This is your second fire . "  | " Regulate the voice . " " Well I do n't see the point of mattress fires , frankly . " " Stop talking , Ozzie . They kill your ass . " Two guards came down the passageway , brushed past Oswald and entered the cell . The fire was so insignificant they were able to delay getting water until after they 'd spent five grim minutes pounding Dupard . Oswald stood at the white line , looking away . They moved him out to the chicken wire . Not only guards but fellow inmates , all those bodies to avoid , those eyes and inner melodies  --  terror , gloom , psycho violence . The trick inside the wire was to stay within your own zone , avoid eye contact , accidental touch , gestures of certain types , anything that might hint at a personalitybehind the drone unit . The only safety was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days . Forever , endless , identical . The brig was so unthinking it eventually drove out fear . He ran in the passageways , he ran in place . He scrubbed the brightwork in the head , squared away his area , made up his rack . The point of the brig was to clean the brig . He drew his bucket from the storeroom , stood at the white line . They 'd built the brig just to keep it clean . It was where they put their white lines . Everything depended on the lines . The brig was the place where all the lines that were painted in the military mind were made bright and clean forever . Once he understood that , he knew he had their number . He sat in the TV room watching reruns of Dick Clark 's AmericanBandstand . Reitmeyer came in to shake his hand . Half a dozen other guys dropped by to ask about the brig . He wore his Hawaiian shirt , smirking a little , telling them he 'd breezed right through . Great training for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's Ozzie for you , said his barracks-mates . That 's the Rabbit ,  |p109that  's Bugs , and they drifted out one by one , leaving him to stare at the high-school boys and girls shuffling drowsily on a dance floor in Philadelphia . Two weeks later he followed directions to a house in the Sanya district of Tokyo . He made his way through a ragpickers ' village built with material scavenged from other parts of the city . Old women jogged through the alleys carrying empty bottles , broken chair legs , pieces of indefinable junk . Houses were shoulder-high , made of old packing crates and strips of sheet metal , the walls stuffed with cardboard and rags . There were lines of people selling blood at mobile units , people who seemed hollow-bodied , so small , in such collapse . It would never bottom out . No matter how far down you went into the world , there were distances still to go , worse things to see and experience . He made it a point not to hurry through the area . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenement and looked in an open door to a flat where a young man was trying to fix a mimeograph machine . Konno had told him to go to the fourth floor but had n't supplied an apartmentnumber . The hallway was dark and rank . A child was wailing on one of the upper stories . Hidell climbs the ancient creaking stairs . On four , two more doors were open . Students milled inside the apartments , moved from one to the other . A young man looked at Ozzie , who was standing in the hallway , smiling , in his T-shirt and dusty jeans . The man smiled back and pointed to a door at the end of the hall . Oswald knocked and was told to enter . He saw a tatami mat and low table . A woman moved across the room . She was about fifty years old , with a moon face and pixie hairdo , wearing a light cotton kimono . She said her name was Dr. Braunfels . She taught German and Russian on a private basis to students at Tokyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he was , and waited . She sat cross-legged on the mat at the far side of the table . She asked him to take off his shoes . These were the nice little gestures that went with the setting . She wore eye makeup that matched the pale-blue shade of thep110kimono . He had n't expected a European . It was encouraging , it was all to the good , it made his decision seem timely , fixed to favorable circumstances . She was probably important , an adviser to radical students and a recruiting officer or handler of agents . She gestured for him to sit facing her on the mat . She watched him assume the awkward position . They ate rice cakes wrapped in seaweed . " And you are Oswald , Lee , " she said finally , as if correcting an imbalance , adding the last stately note to some diplomatic exchange . There were bamboo shades behind her , a screen to one side . The ceiling was low , a dark-toned wood . Small polished objects here and there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things . Twigs in a vase on the lacquer table . He told her he wanted to defect . " I 've been thinking this is the step to take , that I 'll never be able to live in the U.S. I want a life like these students , political , working in the struggle . I 'm not an innocent youth who thinks Russia is the land of his dreams . I look at this coldly in the light of right and wrong . I do think there is something unique about the Soviet Union that I wish to find out for myself . It 's the great theory come to life . Before I was fifteen I began indoctrinating myself in the New Orleans library . I studied Marxist ideology . I could lift my head from a book and see the impoverishment of the masses right there in front of me , including my own mother in her struggle to raise three children against the odds . These socialist writings showed me the key to my environment . The material was correct in its thesis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures . There is hysteria in the air , like hating Negroes and communists . In the military I 'm learning the full force of the system . There is something in the system that builds up hate . How would I live in America ? I would have a choice of being a worker in a system I despise or going unemployed . Nobody knows how I feel about this . I 'm sincere in my ideal that this is what I want to do . This is not something intangible . I 'm ready to go through pain and hardship to leave my country forever . "  |p111That  evening he sat alone at the Queen Bee , thinking he 'd approached the main business too quickly . She did not seem happy to hear the news and she countered it with news of her own . His unit was shipping out for the latest hot spot , Formosa , in a couple of weeks . What she wanted him to do , for now , was put aside any thought of defecting and concentrate on getting access to classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She talked about his job , not his life . She wanted tactical call signs , authentication codes , radio frequencies . She wanted spotter photos of U-2s . There would be money for this , although she realized money was not his motive . She talked about a second meeting in Yamato , near the base , and gave him detailed directions . She spoke in a practiced way about procedures and craft , about the need for discipline , possibly referring to his rumpled street clothes and day-old stubble . She said she admired the Japanese because a man might spend a lifetime getting one thing right . She had a full mouth and pudgy hands . There was a mock girlishness about her , several levels of something tricky and derisive . He told her he was serious about learning Russian . At the Queen Bee he waited for Tammy to finish work and he spent the night with her in the flat she shared with two of her sisters . They had sex , more or less furtively , as the sisters watched TV . Curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his head in the crook of his lover 's arm , he thought of a number of things Dr. Braunfels did n't know . She did n't know he 'd been on mess duty since the first court-martial . Mess duty , guard duty , a series of shit details  --  everything but gazing into radarscopes . She did n't know he 'd lost his security clearance after the second court-martial . She did n't know there was a second court-martial , or a first for that matter , and she did n't know about the incidents that brought them about . One last thing she did n't know , and that was how far out on a limb he would have to go to snatch documents from a restricted area without clearance . Seeing her smooth round face , doing her accented voice , hep112said to himself in the dark , What kind of foul-up do we have here , Oswald Lee ? Back in Atsugi he went on a movie binge . He saw every movie twice , kept to himself , spent serious time at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 's only interested in twisting me dry ? He met her in a flat above a bicycle shop . There was an open umbrella drying in the hall . She wore Western clothes , a raincoat over her shoulders . They shook hands like hospital roommates . She had that cropped uneven hair that was way too young and made him think she was undependable , a person who could not survive without double meanings , or saying one thing to mean the opposite . " You are much greater value , " she said , " going on with your duties , reporting to me at regular times . Go where they send you . Why not ? We wish you to get ahead . You get ahead here , not in Moscow or Leningrad . " " What if I 'm determined to go ? " " This is not the time for you . " " Could n't they train me there , then send me back ? " " You are already back . " A little joke . He told her he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near future . It all depended . In the meantime he showed his good will by reporting the number and type of aircraft in his squadron and the squawk codes for aircraft entering and exiting the identification zone . He did not tell her everything he knew about the U-2 . He told her a few technical things , studying her reaction to the terms . He told her there was talk around the base that the plane 's cameras scanned through multipleapertures . How wide a track ? He hated to say he did n't know . She asked the names of U-2 pilots . She wanted technical manuals , instruction sheets . He gavep113the impression that further information would be available in the normal course of things , depending . He definitely wanted instruction in Russian . He 'd brought along an English-Russian dictionary . The sight of it made Dr. Braunfels sink deeply into her raincoat . She told him never to do that again . She would bring whatever books were needed . They sat at the table in dim light going over pronunciations . She seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep studying on his own , without attracting attention , she would give him as much help as she could . She talked about the language for some time , seemingly against her better judgment , drawn by his earnest desire to learn . Working with her , making the new sounds , watching her lips , repeating words and syllables , hearing his own flat voice take on texture and dimension , he could almost believe he was being remade on the spot , given an opening to some larger and deeper version of himself . The language had a size to it , a deep-reaching honesty . He thought she was a good teacher , firm and serious , and he felt a small true joy pass between them . He said to her , " A thousand years from now , people will look in the history books and read where the lines were drawn and who made the right choice and who did n't . The dynamics of history favor the Soviet Union . This is totally obvious to someone coming of age in America with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions there . The fact is there 's the potential of being attracted to the values . Everyone wants to love America . But how can an honest man forget what he sees in the daily give-and-take that 's like a million little wars ? " Reitmeyer listened to the greetings , which were followed by a halting dialogue , with hand gestures , between his off-and-on buddy Oswald and a corporal named Yaroslaysky . He thought it was curiousthat a pair of U.S. Marines would turn up at muster every day chatting in Russian . It annoyed Reitmeyer . It definitely rubbedp114him the wrong way , the private joke they made of it all , laughing over certain phrases , calling each other comrade . They seemed to think this was hilarious . Seven , eight , nine days running . This halfassforeign gibberish . Only in America , as the saying goes . Except this is Japan , he reminded himself , and every day is a strange day in the fabulous East . He watched Tammy apply eyebrow pencil to her lips , a fad among teen-age girls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that young . Mitsuko had vanished into the floating world and it was possible Tammy would follow any time . She posed for him now in a fluffy blouse and toreador pants . It no longer made Ozzie feel self-conscious to be seen by other Marines with a woman who was put together so well . The guys in MACS-1 could n't figure it out . She took him to a place called the Loneliness Bar , where the hostesses wore swimsuits treated with a chemical substance . The idea was to strike a match on a girl 's backside as she walked by your table . Four Negro GIs went apeshit striking matches on sleek bottoms . There were matches jutting from the knuckles of every hand . They hooted and laughed , could not contain their amazement . They were young Southern Negroes , awkward and spindly , with a likable slapstick manner , and they made him wonder what had happened to Bobby Dupard . It put a kind of doom on the evening . He sat drinking beer in the stink of all those blistered match-heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A night in the life of the Loneliness Bar . Three days later he felt a stinging heat when he pissed . It burned inside . Two days after that he could n't help noticing a thick dischargefrom the selfsame organ . He went to the head in the middle of the night to study the fluid , a dreadful yellowish drip . At the lab they took a series of smears and cultures , gave him nine hundred thousand units of penicillin , intramuscular , over a three-day period , and returned him to light duty . Ozzie had the clap.  |p115The  pilot arrives in an ambulance , with armed guards . He wears a white helmet that is sealed to his airtight suit and he strides to the unmarked plane without delay . The ground crew and guards back off as the engine emits the high-pitched signal that always brings a few men slouching out of the radar shack to watch the black-bandit jet streak down the runway . It 's over almost at once , the shrill sound rising , the strut-and-wheel devices keeping the long wings level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , the pogos drop off , the men try to keep track of the fast steep climb , the brilliant leap into another skin . They scrunch up their faces , peering into the haze . But the object is already gone , part of the high quiet , the flat and seamless sky out there , leaving behind a string of soft drawled curses and murmurs of disbelief . The pilot , sooner or later , whoever he is , whatever his base or his mission , thinks about the items stored in his seat pack . Water , field rations , flares , a first-aid kit ; a hunting knife and pistol ; a needle tipped with lethal shellfish toxin and concealed in a fake silver dollar . ( " We 'd just as soon they did n't get a chance to interrogate you guys , not that we think you 'd breathe a word . " ) There is also the delicate charge of cyclonite that will pulverize the camera and electronic equipment an undetermined number of seconds after the pilot activatesthe timer and gets his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote possibility arise that any such maneuver is necessary . ( " Now , you people understand the ejection seat can cause amputation of the limbs if things do n't work just perfect , so maybe you ought to figure on slipping quietly over the side , like you do n't want to wake the kids . " ) He ca n't help thinking , sooner or later , about the worst that could happen . A stall at extreme altitudes . Or an SA-2 missile just happens to detonate nearby , knocking out a stabilizer . ( " Not that the bastards have the know-how to go that high . " ) Next thing he knows he is out in the stratosphere , sky-hiking with a pack on his back , and he tries to convince a somewhat dreamy hand to jerk the pull-ring . At fifteen thousand feet it happens automatically , swat , the orange plume streaming out of his shoulder blades . It becomes a matter of dignified descent . Ile comes floatingp116down out of the endless pale , struck simultaneously by the beauty of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , in a mask , falling . People come into view , farm hands , children racing toward the spot where the wind will set him down . Their rough caps are tilted back . He is near enough to hear them calling , the words bounced and steered and elongated by the contours of the land . The land smells fresh . He is coming down to springtime in the Urals and he finds that this privileged vision of the earth is an inducement to truth . He wants to tell the truth . He wants to live another kind of life , outside secrecy and guilt and the pull of grave events . This is what the pilot thinks , rocking softly down to the tawny fields of a landscape so gentle and welcoming it might almost be home.  |p117Laurence  Parmenter booked a seat on the daily flight to the Farm , the CIA 's secret training base in Virginia . The flight was operated under military cover and used mainly by Agency people with short-term business at the base . The Farm was known officially by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special language in the Agency . Parmenter was interested in the way this language constantlyfound a deeper level , a secret level where those outside the cadre could not gain access to it . It was possible to say that the closest brotherhood in the Agency was among those who kept the crypt lists , who devised the keys and digraphs and knew the true names of operations . Camp Peary was the Farm , and the Farm was ISOLATION , and ISOLATION probably had a deeper name somewhere , in a locked safe or some computer buried in the ground . He showed his laminated badge to the MP at the gate . The badge was coded to reveal to the trained eye just how much clearance the owner had . After his letter of reprimand , Parmenter had been assigned to what was joshingly called the slave directorate , a supportp118division of clandestine services , and he 'd been issued a new badge with a diminished number of little red letters around the edges . His wife said , " How many letters do you have to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the gatehouse . He wore wellpressedfatigues and had the distant look of a doorman in a gold coat outside a new hotel . Basically he does n't want his friends to see him . He took Parmenter to the JOT area , where junior officer traineesreceived instruction in everything from the paramilitary arts to counterintelligence . They sat alone in one of four sections of bleacher seats that formed an amphitheater over a pit area . Two young men were grappling in the dust . An instructor circled them in a busy way , speaking a language Larry did not recognize . " Things broke our way early , " he said to Mackey , " but we 've reached a static period . " " I 've been in touch with Guy Banister . " " Camp Street . " " That 's the one . He talked to the Dallas field office of the FBI about this Oswald . They finally got him an answer . He left Dallas April twenty-four or twenty-five . " " There 's a Russian wife . " " Left Dallas May ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's right . " " Which leaves us groping . " " I thought you had a line of communication . " " George de Mohrenschildt . But he 's in Haiti . Besides I do n't want him to know how interested we are in Oswald . " " How interested are we ? " " He sounds right , politically and otherwise . Win wants a shooter with credentials . He 's an ex-Marine . I managed to get access to his M-1 scorebook and other records . " " Can he shoot ? " " It 's a little confusing . The more I study the records , the morep119I think we need an interpreter . He was generally rated poor . But it looks like he did his best work the day he fired for qualification . He got a two-twelve rating that day , which makes him a sharpshooter . Except they gave him a lower designation . So either the number is wrong or the designation is wrong . " " Or the kid cheated . " " There 's something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems way too soon . Accidental hits . " " You want a realistic-looking thing . That means multiple rounds flying from a number of directions . " " Win says hit the presidential limousine , hit the pavement , hit a Secret Service man . Just do n't shoot anyone in the car . " " Hit a Secret Service man . " " Hit , do n't kill . " " This is n't a controlled experiment , " Mackey said . " If at all possible , you try to wound one of the men in the follow-up car . The way these things work , there are two agents on each running board of the follow-up car . That 's four dangling men . And the car is going about twelve miles an hour . And it 's only five feet behind the presidential car , which makes it perfectly plausible , an agent taking a bullet meant for the President . " " Where do we do it ? " " Miami . " " Good enough . " " If at all possible , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ought to be Miami . " " Definitely . " " Agreed . " " Sooner or later the President will take a swing through Florida . All the political signs point that way . " Two more young men entered the pit . Mackey said they were South Vietnamese being trained for the secret police . Foreigners attending sessions at the Farm were known as black trainees . A few of them , on sensitive assignments , had been brought to the U.S. under conditions so secure , according to Mackey , that the men didp120not necessarily know what country they were in . Larry thought this was farfetched . Look at the damn trees , you know you 're in Virginia . But he was careful to say nothing to T-Jay . T-Jay was not to be disputed on subjects central to his interests . He told Parmenter he would stay in close touch with Guy Banister . Banister 's detective agency was the Grand Central Station of the Cuban adventure . Every type renegade passed through . Guy would help them locate a substitute for this kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scope . A shooter who could blast a finger off a dangling man . When Parmenter was gone , T-Jay sat in the bleachers watching the Vietnamese bounce each other around . The hot new station was Saigon . It was the talk around the base . They were putting Cuba in a box , which was okay with him . Let them forget . Let them find a new excitement . It would make the moment in Miami all the more powerful . Some hours later Mackey was in his trailer in the woods outside Williamsburg . Light beams floated through the trees and then he heard the ghetto clank of Raymo 's ' 57 Bel Air . He opened the trailer door and watched them get out , two men showing the stiff weighted movements of long-distance drivers . Mackey said , " Just in time for dinner except there is n't any . " The words sounded abrupt and clean in the empty night . " Maybe just a swallow . Un buchito , " Raymo said . " We ate onthe road . " The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes out of the rear seat and then he backed out and stood erect and half turned , his hands occupied , and gave the door a rough shove with his hip and followed with a sweet kick , knocking it shut . Raymo , approaching the trailer , gave a little head-shake at the other man 's treatment of the once-gorgeous car . " Plenty of coffee , " Mackey said . " Good to see you . How are things ? " " Good to see you . Long time . How are things ? "  | " Hello , T-Jay . " " Hello , Frank . I thought you were getting your teeth fixed . " " He never does it , " Raymo said . They embraced , pounding each other on the back , abrazos , absent-minded collisions . " How are things ? " " Long time . " " Too long , my friend . " Standing by the trailer door exchanging nods , looks , halfsentences , everything so clearly shaped , their words sounding well made in the fine light air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they sat drinking coffee . Raymo was at the fold-out table , a thickset man with a wide mustache . He wore a black cowboy hat , black T-shirt , fatigue pants , combat boots . His lounging outfit . Mackey definitely wanted Raymo in on this . Raymo could not light a match , walk his dog , scratch his head without infusing the act with the singlemindedenergy of his rage . It was a consciousness they shared unspokenly , Bahia de Cochinos , the Bay of Pigs , the Battle of Gironwhateveryou wanted to call it . Even his stockiness , all that dense flesh , seemed a form of energy and purpose . A flamingo was etched on his T-shirt . He was the one man T-Jay trusted completely . " We spent part of April with the harvest . " " Picking oranges in central Florida , " Frank said . " We fill ten-box tubs . How many pounds you think that is ? " " He fell off the ladder , " Frank said . " I 'm telling you , man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go to Live Oak near the Georgia border . " " We stack these huge bales of tobacco , " Raymo said . " Like in huge sheets they 're called . They work our ass , T-Jay . " Mackey knew they were working every job they could , night work , spare time , odd job , to save enough money to start a business , maybe a service station or small construction firm . " Then my wife calls us from Miami , " Frank said . " We drive up here right away . " Drive through Georgia and the Carolinas to hear what newsp122T-Jay has for them . It could only be a Cuban operation . Nothing else would make him get in touch with them and nothing else would bring them here . Vasquez sat on the bunk bed . He had a thin sad face and would have seemed at ease in a cobbler 's smock in some dark narrow shop on a fringe street of Little Havana . There were two rows of teeth in his lower jaw , or maybe one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at angles to each other . It made him look like a saint of the poor . A brother and a cousin lost at Red Beach , another brother allowed to die in a hunger strike at La Cabana prison . Frank had been a schoolteacher in Cuba . Now , between jobs , he and Raymo drove to a training camp in the Everglades with the one weapon they owned between them , a so-called Cuban Winchester , put together from elements of three other rifles with handmade parts added on . They drilled with one of the groups out there , living in open huts made of eucalyptus logs and assorted vines . Raymo fired the rifle , swung from ropes , pissed in the tall grass . Frank did some target work but otherwise just hung around , the longtime silent buddy , dressed the way he always dressed , in oversized trousers and a sleeveless sepia shirt worn outside his pants . Both men had been with Castro , originally , in the mountains . " The wife and children , Frank ? They 're well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? What about Raymo ? The right woman does n't show up ? " These were the only men Mackey could talk to like this , in extended ceremonial hellos , little arcs of family news and other details of being . It was the necessary foreground . He knew it was expected and he 'd come to look forward to it . They had to say something to each other . There was only one subject among them and it did not adapt to easy chat . All right . Mackey gave them some background on the operation . Extremely dedicated men were behind it . The idea was to galvanize the nation into full awareness of the danger of a communistCuba . Direccion General de Inteligencia would be exposedp123as a criminal organization willing to take extreme action against important figures who opposed Castro . He told them a shooting was in the works , designed to implicate the DGI . He wanted Frank and Raymo to be part of it and he supplied some operational details . High-powered rifles , elevated perches , a trail of planted evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred dollars a month for each of them , commencingnow , and a nice payday when the job was done . The men behind the plan , he said , were respected Agency veterans , deep believers in a free Havana . He did not mention Everett and Parmenter by name . He did not tell them who their target was or where the shooting would take place . He would let details drop , here and there , in time , as need dictated . The other thing he did not say was that they were supposed to miss . The Parmenters lived in a stunted frame house at the edge of a brick sidewalk in Georgetown . The sidewalk bulged and rippled and the once-quaint house was slightly shabby now , a mousy relic no one noticed . It was Beryl who 'd wanted to live here . The corporate suburbs were not for them , she said . Guarded shoptalk over drinks and dinner with colleagues and their anxious wives . She wanted to live in town . Fanlights , wrought iron , leaded glass . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things lying about , with books , rugs , dust , a wine cellar for Larry , a tininess , an unnoticeability ( if such a word exists ) . There was something about a long and low and openspacehouse with a lawn and a carport that made her feel spiritually afraid . Larry paced the small rooms now , drink in hand , wearing an enormous striped robe . Beryl was at her writing desk clipping news items to send to friends . This was a passion she 'd discovered recently like someone in middle life who finds she was born to show pedigreeddogs . Nothing that happened before has any meaning corn/pared to this . A week 's worth of newspapers sat on the desk . She sent clippings to everyone . There was suddenly so much to clip . " Look at this , now . Am I angry or amused ? " She turned around to find her husband . " Look at this , Larry . A folk singer named Bob Dylan is told by CBS he ca n't sing one of his songs on The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's controversial about it ? " " It 's called Talkin ' John Birch Society Blues . ' " " Is he white or Negro ? Because white boys should n't mess with the blues . " " But imagine forbidding him airtime . " " I 'll try to get worked up about it . Give me ten minutes . " " I know the signs , old boy . " " What signs ? " " When you sweep through the house guzzling gin . I know exactly what it means . Nostalgic for Guatemala . " Some people thought Beryl had money . It was one of the false impressions that collected around her . What she actually had was a small picture-framing shop on Wisconsin Avenue , strictly a marginalincome  --  lithographs , photographs , framing . Other people thought she was creative . One of the softer arts , quilt-making , water colors . She had a look and manner people took to be unconventional in a certain way , a kind of reclusiveness in a crowd . She wore soft clothes . She draped herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastels . There was always the idea she was in quiet retirementfrom some fear or pain . She bought factory-outlet moccasins , never wore jewelry , kept snapshots of her mother in favorite books . People thought she was a canned-soup heiress who painted seascapes with birds . She ate soft food , spoke softly , with a slight huskiness , a sexiness . She was very sexy , at forty-seven . There was still that smoky little thing about her . The sexy swaying walk , the dark voice . She had a dry way of delivering friendly insults directly into people 's chests . She walked softly swaying into a room and you could sense anticipation in the group . They began preparing their laughter before she said a word.  |p125It  was seen as a mark of the Parmenters ' sophistication that she raked the Agency in mixed company while Larry looked on grinning . Not that she did n't mean what she said . " No . I am not making fun . I admire what you did in Guatemala . If not politically , then in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " It was a textbook operation . " " Of course there would have been no need for an operation if the Guatemalans had n't taken back all that land belonging to United Fruit . " " Is that what happened ? Oh . " " I love the way you say textbook operation . " Yes . It was also the peak experience of Larry 's career , centering on a radio station supposedly run by rebels from a jungle outpost in Guatemala . The broadcasts actually originated in a barn in Hondurasand the messages were designed to put pressure on the leftist government and arouse anxiety in the people . Rumors , false battle reports , meaningless codes , inflammatory speeches , orders to nonexistentrebels . It was like a class project in the structure of reality . Parmenter wrote some of the broadcasts himself , going for vivid imagery , fields of rotting bodies , fighter pilots defecting with their planes . A real pilot tossed dynamite sticks out the window of his Cessna . A real bomb fell on a parade ground , sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine days after an invasion force of five thousand troops was said to be advancing on the capital . The force materialized then , several trucks and a crowded station wagon , about a hundred and fifty ragged recruits . That was nine years ago . Larry became involved in proprietaries for a time , legally incorporated businesses actually financed and controlled by CIA . When the Agency wanted to do something interesting in Kurdistan or Yemen , it filed for incorporation in Delaware . It was during this period that he came into contact with a number of Agency assets who had important holdings in sensitive parts of the hemisphere . A man from United Fruit , a man from the Cuban-Venezuelan Oil Trust ( it was George de Mohrenschildt as a matter of fact ) . Merchant banks , sugar companies , arms dealers.  |p126A  curious convergence of motives and holdings . Hotel interests here , gambling interests there . Men with vivid histories , sometimes includingprison . He saw there was a natural kinship between business and intelligence work . And he realized that the companies he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for legitimate profits  --  and beyond that , for enormous personal gain . Contact with wealthy and influential men was a bracing experience for someone who 'd been brought up to believe in the American genius for making leaps to new levels of privilege . Being rich , he saw , was something you grew into . The Agency had huge collections of intelligence on banana republics and their leaders . Larry traded secrets for pieces of promising action . He spent time in Cuba , setting up transactions between the Batista government and interests in the U.S. He helped arrange mineral surveys , landdevelopmentdeals , drilling contracts , casino franchises . He traveled to Oriente Province to learn the extent of the rebel threat to cane fields controlled by U.S. firms . The extent was considerable . When the American executives left their palm-shaded streets and large white houses , when the cooks and gardeners looked for new situations , when the company guards fled , when the local army post was overrun , Laurence Parmenter 's fortune was still in the ground of the unexplored oil properties of Cuba . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Orson Welles in deep focus . " He stood in the doorway smiling absently at the familiar flatness in her voice , not quite hearing what she said . " On second thought I 'll tell you what you look like . You look like one of those corrupt barons in Ivan the Terrible , got up deliciouslyin animal skins . Make me a drink so I can keep you company . We ought to keep each other company . " After the revolution came the plan to invade . He helped set up the Double-Chek Corporation , a front for the recruitment of pilot instructors . Gibraltar Steamship came next , a company whose nominal head was a former State Department officer and ex-presidentof United Fruit . Parmenter himself could not always tell where the Agency left off and the corporations began . There were menp127related by blood and by marriage ; there were company directors who were former high-ranking intelligence officers ; there were governmentadvisers who were once company directors . It was a society he recognized as a better-working version of the larger world , where things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the plan was tighter . These were men who believed history was in their care . Gibraltar Steamship provided cover for propaganda operations against Cuba . The device was Radio Swan , a transmitter stored in an oversized trailer on a remote island in the western Caribbean . Great Swan Island was the product of hundreds of years of bird droppings . There were three coconut palms , twenty-eight people . Lovely numbers , everyone agreed , pointing toward barrenness and isolation , the soul-testing elements of the trade . For the invasion Parmenter used the same broadcast techniques that had worked in Guatemala . Cryptic messages from spy movies of the forties . " Attention , Eduardo , the moon is red . " Romantic imagery employing the names of local wildlife . " The barracuda sleeps at sundown . " " The shark leaves a golden trail . " Mackey would later tell Parmenter that in his LCI lying to off Blue Beach , this gibberish had the sound of a mind unraveling . It diminished the whole operation , made comic fucking opera of troops in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington at the Agency 's invasion headquarters , a tempo building near the Lincoln Memorial . He was eating a soggy meal off a paper plate when news hit the control room that JFK would not approve air cover for the landings . The men did not accept it at first . Too unbelievably stupid and cruel . A colonel in golf togs walked through . The men shouted at superiors , damn near grew violent . Someone vomited lazily in a wastebasket , leaning over with his hands on his knees . Win Everett arrived from Miami , wrote out a letter of resignation , tore it up , flew back to Miami to be with exile leaders who were confined in a barracks at Opa-Locka so they would not leak word of the landings . It was the first major death watch in South Florida that week . No one used the term textbook operation . Three days laterp128Radio Swan was still on the air , promising the abandoned troops in Zapata swamp that help was on the way . Larry slept on a cot in grubby clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaving had an impact on his morale and he needed all the help he could get . Several weeks earlier he 'd borrowed heavily to buy stock in Francisco Sugar at depressed prices . Sugar was the word going round . There were stunning profits to be made , insiders said , once the plantations were back in U.S. control . " People think we 're the strangest marriage , " Beryl said . " Why should they ? Who ? What 's strange about us ? " " Only everything . " " People think we 're interesting . That 's my impression . " " They think we 're strange . We have nothing in common . We have no practical reason for being . We never even talk about practicalthings . " " We have no children . We 're not parents . Parents talk about practical things . They have reasons to be practical . " " With or without children . Believe me . We 're considered strange . " " I do n't think we 're strange . I think we 're interesting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're also strange . I 'm the one they focus on . I 'm the stranger of the two . " " I do n't like conversations like this . I do n't know how to have these conversations . " " They 're probably not a good idea . " " So let 's change the subject , " he said . " Although the fact of the matter is you 're far stranger , love , than I could ever think of being . " " Strange how ? I 'm not strange . I do n't like this at all . " " Strange like a man . Strange like someone I could never know the heart of , the truth of . " " This is thankfully outside my range . " " I do n't think I could ever begin to imagine in years and years of living intimately with a man what it is like to be him . " " Funny . I thought women were the secret . "  | " No no no no no , " she said softly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom handed down from man to boy , through the ages , a hundred generations of knowledge and experience . But it is just another Agency lie . " From the moment the CIA monitored a rebel broadcast on January 1 , 1959 , announcing that the tyrant Batista had fled the country at 2:00 A. M. and that Dr. Fidel Castro Ruz was the supreme leader of the Cuban revolution , from that moment to this , four and a half years later , as he stood in his striped robe mixing a drink for his wife , Larry Parmenter had been involved in one or another plot to get Cuba back . Soldiering on , Beryl said . She liked to remind him that he was not vindictive , had no strong political convictions , did not hate Castro or wish to see physical harm come to him . Larry was famous in fact for going to a costume party as Fidel Castro , with beard , cigar , khaki fatigues , about a month before the invasion . Seemed funny at the time . One thing Larry did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow he 'd occasionally had to deal with in joint efforts to recover investmentsin Cuba . The gambling interests , the casinos and hotels , the men who bought off officials routinely , who sent a steady traffic of couriers with hefty satchels moving through the Bahamas to the International Credit Bank in Geneva  --  men who thought longinglyof the millions they 'd once skimmed from the gaming tables in Havana . He wanted nothing to do with those roly-poly wops . Earlier that day a young man walked into the outer office at Guy Banister Associates in New Orleans . Delphine Roberts was at her desk typing a revised list of civil-rights organizations for Banister'sfiles . The young man stood patiently waiting , in jeans with rolled cuffs , two days ' stubble on his chin . Delphine stopped typinglong enough to pat her teased hair , a nervous habit she was determined to overcome . Then she resumed her work , aware that the young man was studying a calendar on the wall in order top130kid himself into thinking he was not being made to wait . She knew all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutinizea visitor at the same time . This visitor had a little smile that seemed to say , Here I am  --  just the fellow you 've been waiting for . " I would like to fill out an application for a position with the firm . Delphine kept on typing . " You have people who do undercover work , I believe , like mingle with students or go to political meetings . I am referring to collecting information . I want to apply to become an undercover agent . I have a verified alias . I have served in the armed forces . And I have lived abroad in a situation that gave me special depth into the communist mentality . " Delphine was not surprised . They had some thought-provoking individuals walking in unannounced at 544 Camp . This address tended to draw people from a colorful range of backgrounds . She stopped typing long enough to give the young man an application . He said he had to get back to work at the coffee company around the corner but he would fill out the form and return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Ferrie came out of the small back room and said in his routine disbelieving whisper , " Who on earth was that ?

" " Like insanity in the family . Or give us the history of your disease . " " It says whatever you want it to say , Dave . I 'm very , very busy . " " How can a person explain his disease on a printed form ? " David Ferrie went into Guy Banister 's office , which was empty , and looked out the street-side window , trying to catch a glimpse ofp131the young man whose voice he 'd just been listening to . Had he caught something familiar in the tone ? Would he be able to match a body to the voice ? He looked at the swarm of people moving down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sign of the sweetvoicedboy who wants to be a spy.  |p132In  fort WorthEven coming back he was a military man . His father was a veteran . His brothers were in the service . My own brother was a navy man . We were a serviceman family . He sent me a regular allotment every month out of his pay and when he heard about my injury , which I said in a letter , he put in for a hardship discharge as I was disabled from work and trying for six months to collect on my claim . He was stationed in California then and they let him go early in order to help his mother . This is the injury of a candy jar falling off a shelf that four doctors have taken x-rays of my nose and face and there is travel time and carfare and the store is still holding tight to their cash . I am a disabled woman who ca n't collect .

That was ourp133only conversation over three days where he slept on a cot in the kitchen , which was the only place I had for him , plus he told me that he passed his high-school-level tests , Mother , which I do n't know why you need this to lift crates on a boat . He was here only parts of three days before packing a bag and leaving . Then I received a letter postmarked New Orleans that he has booked passage on a ship to Europe .

Aboard the freighter SS Marion Lykes bound for Le Havre . The oddball loner has little to say to the three other passengers on the sixteen-day crossing . Gray seas , high swells , missed meals . He tells them he is going to school in Switzerland but does n't mention the name of the institution or the course of study he plans to follow . He avoids a passenger 's friendly attempts to take his picture . She is a nice enough lady whose husband is a lieutenant colonel , U.S. Army , retired . You 'd think in the middle of the ocean he 'd be able to sit on deck without answering questions from some clear-eyed military type .

They almost glow with self-awareness , headed for foreign shores , surrounded and attended by a partly foreign and mainly dark-skinned crew , delighting in theirp134own straightforward and affirmative ways , their democratic values , their moral strength , the way they hold their knife and fork , smiling over the glitter , and this is why he will not eat with them or share their conversation . The spiral rind of a tangerine sits in a white saucer in front of him . He thinks of the nine months he spent at the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro in California , after Japan . He continued his Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fidel Castro ) and developed a neat little deception for the venture he was now engaged in . At the base library he found a catalogue listing the names of colleges abroad . He scanned the list for obscure schools in certain locations , then wrote away for an application .

On the application form he listed under special interests : Philosophy , Psychology , Ideology , Football , baseball , tennis , Stamp collecting . Vocational interest ( if decided upon ) : To be a short story writer on contemporary American life . In certain light the sea goes green , a slow dullish tumble he watches from the deck . When he goes below again he lies on his bunk , aware of the great slow creaking of the ship , like a mind stirring around him . Hawsers are ropes for mooring .

It pleased her that Win 's office was in the oldest building on campus . The building pleased her with its arched entranceways and two-story columns . Denton had its hidden streets , its sense of languorous history , an old American stillness , wistful and unchanged , and these older traces too , older ideas and values scored in limestone and marble , in scroll ornaments atop a column or in the banknote details of a frieze . The Old Main , the county courthouse , the broad-fronted homes , the homes with deep shady porches , the trees , the streets named for trees  --  all this pleased her , made her think that happiness lived minute by minute in the things she saw and heard . Being happy was a small awareness , the sum of small awarenesses , day by day , minute by minute , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as in the heart . Suzanne sat next to her mother , arms at her sides , slim white legs pointed straight out , a show of mock obedience . They were not talking to each other.  |p136You  could be happy now . It did not have to be experienced in retrospect , as Win believed , as he liked to explain in his mild way , with the face he called a failed professor 's tipped slightly right . It was not a slow-working glow or meditation . You could feel it now , collect it in the names of things around you , in chinaberry , oak and slippery elm . It pleased her to live here , after Miami , Havana , Mexico City , Guatemala City , temporary housing in southeast Virginia ( ISOLATION ) , dusty tracts of identical homes near the Carolina coast ( ISOLATION TROPIC ) . They would go to the Steak House on South Locust for jumbo shrimp with salad , french fries and hot rolls and then Win would suggest an ice cream at Lane 's . Bright hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawns . Suzanne was holding her breath . In his basement office in the Old Main , Win Everett was on the phone with Parmenter . " How does Mackey know all this if he has n't made contact ? " " Whatever T-Jay knows comes out of Banister 's office . Oswald confides in one of Banister 's people . " " Go ahead . " " In January he orders a snub-nose .38 from a firm in Los Angeles . In March he sends away to Chicago for an Italian carbine with a sniper 's scope . " " Armed and dangerous , " Win said softly . " Plus . Are you ready ? He 's handing out pro-Castro leaflets on the street . He was on the docks two or three days ago pushing leaflets at sailors off an aircraft carrier . " Everett looked into space . " How does this fit in with the fact that he has the use of an office in the same building as Banister 's detective agency , right above Banister 's office , which is the damn pivot point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't fit in , " Parmenter said . " I 'm glad you said that . I thought I might be missing some-thing . " " All I know is what T-Jay tells me . As follows . The subject walks into Banister 's office looking for an undercover job . Banister installs him in a broom closet upstairs . This little-bitty room becomesthe New Orleans headquarters of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee . And the subject hits the streets in a white shirt and tie , handing out leaflets . " They talked about Oswald as the subject in the same way they referred to the President as Lancer , which was his Secret Service code name . Habit . One wants the least possible surface to which pain and regret might cling  --  anyone 's , everyone 's pain . A thought for late afternoon . " Let me understand the sequence , " Win said . " The subject leaves Dallas . He is gone , out of our lives , a promising part of our operation lost forever . " " Then he turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him . " " He turns up , out of nowhere , in New Orleans , in Guy Banister'soffice , looking for an undercover assignment . The same fellow who defected to the bloody Soviet Union , who used his mail-order rifle to take a shot at General Walker . Strolls right into the middle of the enemy camp . " " Mackey was supposed to ask Guy Banister to find a substitute for our boy . What happens ? The original walks in off the street . " Everett searched his pockets for a cigarette . " You 've got to get close to the subject , " he said . " Oh no . " " Look , Larry . " " I do n't want personal contact any more than you do , my friend . Give him to Mackey . " " Where is he ? " " Still at the Farm as far as I know . " " All right . Look . Get inc a sample of the kid 's handwriting . "  | " I 'll talk to T-Jay right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the main floor . Nobody at the desk . He went outside . School year ended , slow-moving figures in the distance , summer students , maintenance men , and a lawn sprinkler sending out spray in overlapping arcs , all the lazy brightness of cobwebbed grass . Before the murder attempt comes the provocation . He 'd devised a top-secret memo from the Deputy Director Plans to selected members of the Senior Study Effort , dated May 1961 . It concerned the assassination of foreign leaders from a philosophicalpoint of view . It also included a fragment from the psalmbook , not known to the outside world . Terminate with extreme prejudice . Parmenter was handling the actual production of the memo on a suitable typewriter and stationery . Two . Through his contacts in Little Havana , Everett had planted a cryptic news item in an exile magazine published in New Jersey . The story , from an unnamed source , concerned an operation run in July 1961 by the Office of Naval Intelligence out of Guantanamo , the U.S. base near the eastern end of Cuba . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , involving the assassination of Fidel Castro and his brother Raul . This news item would be found among the subject 's effects after the failed attempt on the life of the President . Three . He was working on a scheme involving telephone notes on pages of stationery used by the Technical Services Division . Doodles , phone numbers , abbreviations of the names of advanced poisons produced by a special unit of the division , known entertaininglyas the Health Alteration Committee . A person following the sequence of phone numbers would be led along a serendipitous path with a number of ordinary stops ( florist , supermarket ) as well as the home of an exile leader in Miami , a motel in Key Biscayne known to be mob-run , a yacht moored at a Miami marina  --  living quarters of the CIA 's chief of station . He headed toward the car . Local color , background , connections for investigators to pon/der . He had other schemes , other documents , authentic , relating to attempts on Castro 's life  --  attempts he 'd personally been involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parmenter to get this reading matter , circuitously , into the hands of journalists , subcommitteemembers and anyone else who might bring them to light . Once people saw the attempt on the President as a Cuban response to repeated efforts of U.S. intelligence to murder Castro , we were all halfway home to getting the island back . He saw them sitting in the car . He began to smile , shielding his eyes from the sun . He approached the front door on the passenger side . The wet grass looked spangled in the heat and glare . He tiptoed closer , smiling broadly , waiting for Suzanne to spot him . Guy Banister sat alone in the Katz &; Jammer Bar . He had his private spot at the near end , where the bar curves into the wall . He liked to sit with his back against the wall , looking out to the street , to the neon heads bobbing past the Falstaff sign in the high window . His doctor told him do n't drink . He drank . Do n't smoke . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer hours , compiled longer lists , shipped arms , stored munitions , ran a network of clean-cut boys who spied on local universities . Dave Ferrie had this routine about a tumor growing on his brain . But it was Banister who had blackouts and dizzy spells , who sat at his desk and watched his hand start trembling , way out there , as if it belonged to someone else . He was sixty-three years old , twenty years in the Bureau , a decorated agent drinking alone in a bar . He carried a blue-steel Colt under his jacket , chambered for the .357 magnum cartridge . Guy sincerely believed the old reliable .38 special with standard police loads was simply not enough gun for the type of situation a man of his standing might run into any time of day or night . Amen . Beautiful auburn glitter at the bottom of the glass . He knocked back the last of the bourbon and watched the man come forward.  | " We got him coming out of the Biograph in Chicago , July of ' 34 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater . " " This is who are we talking about now , " says the jug-eared barman . " Mr. John Dillinger . This is who . Fill the fucking glass . " " Rocks or not ? " " Famous finish . Old Dillinger buffs could tell you what was playing at the movie house when we gunned him down . " " All right I 'll bite . " " Manhattan Melodrama with Clark Gable . " The barman poured the drink , oblivious . " Whenever there 's a famous finish in the vicinity of a movie house , it behooves you to know what 's playing . " " I do n't doubt it , Mr. Banister . " " This is history with a fucking flourish . " He 'd shipped munitions to the Keys for the bombing of refineries , for the Bay of Pigs . There was so much ordnance stored in his office he had to get Ferrie to take some home . Ferrie had land mines stacked in his kitchen . With dozens of factions angling for a second invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Raids and seizures were commonplace now . Things were turning upside down . He saw the kid Oswald walk past the window on his way home from work at the William Reily Coffee Company . Another bobbing head in the great New Orleans current . The hand starts trembling way out there . It has nothing to do with him . He worked longer hours , compiled longer lists . He had researcherscoming up with names all the time . He wanted lists of subversives , leftist professors , congressmen with dubious voting records . He wanted lists of niggers , nigger lovers , armed niggers , pregnantniggers , light-skinned niggers , niggers married to whites . You could n't photograph a nigger . He 'd never seen a picture of a nigger where you could make out the features . It 's just a fact of nature they do n't emit light.  |p141The  Times-Picayune was full of stories about the civil-rights program of JFK . You could photograph a Kennedy all right . That 's what a Kennedy was for . The man with the secrets gives off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave away China . We gave away Cuba , just ninety miles off our coast . We 're getting ready to give away Southeast Asia . We 'll give away white America next . We 'll give it to the Nee-groes . One thing Guy could n't stand about these sit-ins and marches . When the goddamn whites get to singing . The whole occasion falls apart . It makes everyone feel bad . He called the barman over . " You know this Kennedy goes around with ten or fifteen people who look just like him . You know about that ? " " No . " " You never heard about that ? " " I never heard he had anybody . " " He has got them , " Banister said . " That look like him . " " He has got about fifteen . Whenever he goes anyplace , they go too . They 're on constant fucking standby . You know why ? Diversionary . Because he knows he 's made a lot of people mad . " He was as old as the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local police until he fired his gun into the ceiling of some tourist bar . He finished his drink and got up to leave . Public enemy number one . Sweltering night in July . We got him in an alley near the Biograph . His office was next door to the bar but he did not use the Camp Street entrance , which was where they 'd be waiting to blast him if and when the time came , now or later , day or night . He used the side entrance , on Lafayette , and trudged up the stairs to the second floor . Delphine was at the desk in the outer office . She gave him a little prissy look that meant she knew he 'd been drinking . With a mistress like this , he did n't need a wife.  | " There 's something I think you definitely ought to know , " she said . " Chances are I do know . " " Not this you do n't . " He sat on the vinyl sofa that Ferrie said carried cancer agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack and lighting it . He had a Zippo he 'd carried through the war that still worked perfect , with a whoosh and flare . " It 's about this Leon upstairs , whatever his name is , working in the vacant room . " " Oswald . " " I was up there after lunch trying to track down some files that just got up and walked off . There was no one in the office . Just small piles of handbills on a table . What do they say ? Hands off Cuba . Fair Play for Cuba . This is pro-Castro material sitting on a table right over our heads . " Guy Banister gave a little twirl of the hand that held the cigarette . " Go ahead , what else , " he said , an amused light in his eye . " This is no joke , Guy . There is inflammatory reading matter in that little office . " " Just you make sure those circulars do n't get up and walk off in this direction . I do n't want them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It amounts to the same thing . " " Then you know about it . " " We 'll just see how it all works out . " " Well what do you know about him ? " " Not a hell of a lot , personally . He 's working mainly with Ferrie . Ferrie recommended him . He 's a David Ferrie project . " " I wonder what that means , " Delphine said . Banister smiled and got up . He put his cigarette in the ashtray on the desk .. Then he stood behind Delphine 's chair and massaged her shoulders and neck . On the desk was a recent issue of On Target , the newsletter of the Minutemen . A line in italics caught his eye . Even now the crosshairs are centered on the back of your neck.  |p143Something  in the air . There were forces in the air that men sense at the same point in history . You can feel it on your skin , in the tips of your fingers . " What about the fellow who called early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in more ways than one . " " Did you wire him fifty dollars ? " " Just like you said . " " One of Mackey 's people . New to me . I told him how to contact T-Jay . She put her hand to her hair , looking toward the smoked-glass panel on the office door . " Do I get to see my G-man later tonight ? " He reached across her shoulder for his cigarette . " I want you to start a file , " he told her , " before you leave the office . Fair Play for Cuba . Give it a nice pink cover . " " What do I put in the file ? " " Once you start a file , Delphine , it 's just a matter of time before the material comes pouring in . Notes , lists , photos , rumors . Every bit and piece and whisper in the world that does n't have a life until someone comes along to collect it . It 's all been waiting just for you . " Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long bench in the waiting room at Union Station this chilly A.M. in Denver . It occurred to Wayne that for some time now he was always arriving or departing . He was never anywhere you could actually call a place . He was n't here and was n't there . It was like a problem in philosophy . Next to him on the bench was his khaki knapsack and an overthe-hillshopping bag from some A &P; on the Coast . His life in material things he carried in these two weary pokes . He was a long-chance man . This was a term from the real frontier a hundred years ago . For twenty dollars he 'd roll your odometer back twenty thousand miles . Took about fifteen minutes.  |p144For  a hundred dollars he 'd set a charge of plastique and blow the car into car heaven if your insurance needs were such . Except he 'd probably do it free . Just for the science involved . Early light collected at the tall arched windows . The benches were thirty feet long , with high backs , curved backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waiting room was empty except for two or three station familiars , the two or three shadowy men he saw at every stop , living in the walls like lizards . The silence , the arched windows , the wooden benches and chandeliers made him think of church , a church you travel to on trains , coming out of the noise and steam to this high empty place where you could think your quietest thoughts . He was asleep ten minutes on the bench when a cop bounced his nightstick off Wayne 's raised knee . It made a sound like he was built of hollow wood . Welcome to the Rockies . He got up , took his things , crossed the street and went immediately to sleep on the concrete loading-platform of a warehouse . This time it was trucks that got him up . He wandered an area of refrigerated warehouses with old dual-gauge tracks intersecting on the cobbled streets . At Twentieth and Blake he saw a man swabbing a garbage truck . They had a hundred wrecked cars behind barbed wire and a thousand specks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken-glass district of Denver . At Twentieth and Larimer he saw some men with a stagger in their gait . Early-rising winos out for a stroll . Baptist Mission . Money to Loan . A guy with a Crazy Guggenheim hat came pitching down the street ; might be Indian , Mexican , mix-blood or who knows what , muttering curses in some invented tongue . Made Wayne think of the faces in the Everglades and on No Name Key during his training with the Interpen brigade . All those guys who 'd fought for Castro and then crossed over . Dark rage in every face . Fidel betrays the revolution . He 'd lived with a shifting population of rogue commandos in a boardinghouse on Southwest Fourth Street in Miami . They spent weeks at a time training in the mangrove swamps and went on forays along the Cuban coast in a thirty-five-foot launch , mainly to landp145agents and shoot at silhouettes . Otherwise they stayed close to the clapboard house , cleaning submachine guns in the backyard . Judo instructors , tugboat captains , homeless Cubans , ex-paratroopers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Africa or Malay . They were like guys straight out of Wayne 's favorite movie , Seven Samurai , warriors without masters , willing to band together to save a village from marauders , to win back a country , only to see themselves betrayed in the end . First it was Navy jets making reconnaissance runs over No Name Key , snapping little pix of the muddy boys . Next it was five Interpen commandos picked up for vagrancy , courtesy of the Dade County sheriff . Then U.S. customs officers pounced , arresting a dozen men , including Wayne Elko in battle gear and a lampblacked face , just as they were setting out for Cuba in the twin-engine launch . JFK had made his deal with the Soviets to leave Castro alone . Incredible . The same man Wayne would have voted for if he 'd gotten around to registering . He believed in country , loyalty , mountainsand streams . They were all tied together . He found a telephone and made a collect call to the New Orleans number T. J. Mackey had given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end he wished to speak to a Mr. Guy Banister . " This is Wayne Elko calling . It seems like I have washed up in Denver , Colorado , tell T-Jay , and I am looking for a chance at some employment . " Win Everett was in his basement at home , hunched over the worktable . His tools and materials were set before him , mainly household things , small and cheap  --  cutting instruments , acetate overlays , glues and pastes , a soft eraser , a travel iron . He felt marvelously alert , sure of himself , putting together a man with scissors and tape . His gunman would emerge and vanish in a maze of false names . Investigators would find an application for a post-office box ;  |p146a  certificate of service , U.S. Marine Corps ; a Social Security card ; a passport application ; a driver 's license ; a stolen credit card and half a dozen other documents  --  in two or three different names , each leading to a trail that would end at the Cuban Intelligence Directorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ink on the raised letters with a Q-tip doused in polyester resin . A radio on a shelf played soothing music . He pressed the card against the warm iron , heating it slowly to flatten the letters . Then he used a razor blade to level the remaining bumps and juts . He would eventually reheat the card and stamp a new name and number on its face with an addressograph plate . He 'd picked up a certain amount of sleazy tradecraft in his early years as an operations officer . Before that he 'd taught in a series of small liberal-arts colleges in the Midwest , places like Franklin , in Indiana , where a perceptive colleague , affiliated somehow or other with CIA , recruited him for covert training . The idea seemed immediately right , a possible answer to the restlessness he 'd felt working through his system , a sense that he needed to risk something important , challenge his moral complacencies , before he could see himself complete . Soon he was taking handy instructionin Flaps &; Seals , or how to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and remembering now and then those sleepy afternoons at little Franklin College . After some years in Havana and Central America , including duty as chief of station in Guatemala City , he was one of several men assigned to coordinate the training of a Cuban exile brigade . He was in a constant hurry after that . Underwater demolition in Puerto Rico and North Carolina , paratroop maneuvers outside Phoenix , teams to organize in Nicaragua , Miami , Key West . He felt sharp now , better than he 'd felt in some time , on top of things , alert . The young man 's address book would be next . A major project . Once he had a handwriting sample , Win would scratch onto those miniature pages enough trails , false trails , swarming life , lingeringp147mystery , enough real and fabricated people to occupy investigators for months to come . He unscrewed the top of the Elmer 's Glue-All . He used his X-Acto knife to cut a new signature strip from a sheet of opaque paper . He checked the length and width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the credit card . Then he dribbled an even stream of glue over the paper and pressed it lightly on the card . He listened to the radio while the glue dried . He was in a constant hurry then . Fort Gulick in the Canal Zone . Trax Base in Guatemala . Things were quieter now . He had time to turn the pages of all the books he 'd been meaning to read . After the address book came the false names . He looked forward to coming up with names . He removed excess glue from the back of the card with one of Suzanne 's school erasers . Then he turned off the radio , turned off the light , climbed the old plank stairs . His gunman would appear behind a strip of scenic gauze . You have to leave them with coincidence , lingering mystery . This is what makes it real . He checked the front door . The days came and went . Bedtime again . Always bedtime now . He went around turning off lights , checked the back door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant all was well . Someday this operation would be studied at the highest levels of intelligence in Langley and the Pentagon . He turned off the kitchen light . He began to climb the stairs , felt compelled to double-check the oven , although he was certain it was off . Astonish them . Create coincidence so bizarre they have to believe it . Create a loneliness that beats with violent desire . This kind of man . An arrest , a false name , a stolen credit card . Stalking a victim can be a way of organizing one 's loneliness , making a network out of it , a fabric of connections . Desperate men give their solitude a purpose and a destiny . The oven was off . He made an effort to register this fact . Then he went upstairs , hearing soft music on the bedroom radio . This kind of man . A self-watcher , a man who lives in randomp148space . If the world is where we hide from ourselves , what do we do when the world is no longer accessible ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase a firearm through the mail . Lancer is going to Honolulu . At one level he operated well . He felt alert , marvelously sharp , very much on top of things . The address book was next . We want a spectacular miss . A voice on KDNT said that an eight-nation committee of the Organization of American States has charged Cuba with promoting Marxist subversion in our hemisphere . The island is a training center for agents . The government has begun a new phase of encouraging violence and unrest in Latin America . He did n't need these reminders . He did n't need announcers telling him what Cuba had become . This was a silent struggle . He carried a silent rage and determination . He did n't want company . The more people who believed as he did , the less pure his anger . The country was noisy with fools who demeaned his anger . He put on his pajamas . He seemed to be in pajamas all the time now . The day was n't half done and it was time to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched off the radio , switched off the lamp . He spoke inwardly to whatever force was out there , whatever power ruled the sky , the endless hydrogen spirals , the region of all night , all souls . He said simply , Please let me sleep but not dream . Dreams sent terrors you could not explain.  |p149In  MoscowHe opened his eyes to the large room . There were high walls , old plush chairs , a heavy rug with a stale odor hanging close . He got out of bed and walked to the window . Hurrying people , long lines for buses . He washed and shaved . He put on a white shirt , gray flannel trousers , the dark narrow tie , the tan cashmere sweater , and stood in his bare feet at the window once more . Muscovites , he thought . After a while he put on his socks and good shoes and the flannel suit coat . He looked in the gilt mirror . Then he sat in one of the old chairs in the lace-curtained room and crossed one leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history now . Later he would print in his Historic Diary a summary of these days and of the weeks and months to follow . The lines , mainly in block letters , wander and slant across the page . The page is crowded with words , top to bottom , out to either edge , crossed-out words , smudged words , words that run together , attempted corrections and additions , lapses into script , a sense of breathlessness , with odd calm fragments.  |p150He  told his Intourist guide , a young woman nailed Rimma , that he wanted to apply for Soviet citizenship . She is flabbergassed , but aggrees to help . Asks me about myself and my reasons for doing this . I explaine I am a connnunist , ect . She is politly sym. but uneasy now . She tries to be a friend to me . She feels sorry for me I am someth. new . On his twentieth birthday , two days after his arrival , Rimma gave him a Dostoevsky novel , in Russian , and she wrote on a blankpage : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Things happened fast after that . He had no timeto work out meanings , fall back on old attitudes and positions . The secret he 'd carried through the Marine Corps for over a year , his plan to defect , was the most powerful knowledge in his life up to this point . Now , in the office of some bald-head official , he tried to explain what itmeant to him to live in the Soviet Union , at the center of world struggle . The man looked past Oswald to the closed door of his office . " USSR is only great in literature , " he said . " Go home , my friend , and take our good wishes with you . " He was n't kidding either . I am stunned I reiterate , he says he shall check and let me know . They let him know the same day . The visa of Lee H. Oswaldwould expire at 8:00 P.M. He had two hours to leave he country . The police official who called with this news did not seem to knowOswald had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee tried to explain that the first official had not given a deadline , had heldout hope that his visa might be extended . He could not recall the man 's name or the department he belonged to in theMinistry ofInternal Affairs . He began to describe the man 's office , his clothing . He felt a rush of desperation . The second official didmit know what he was talking about.  |p151It  was this blankness that caused his terror . No one could distinguish him from anyone else . There was some trick he had n't mastered which might easily set things right . Other people knew what it was ; he did not . Other people got along ; he could not . He 'd come so far on his own . Le Havre , Southampton , London , Helsinki  --  thenby train across the Soviet border . He 'd made plans , he 'd engineered a new life , and now no one would take ten minutes to understand who he was . A zero in the system . He sat near the window looking at the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his things still unpacked . I am shocked ! ! My dreams ! He was a foreigner here . There was no profit in discontent . He could not apply his bitterness . It was American-made and had no local standing . For the first time he realized what a dangerous thing he 'd done , leaving his country . He struggled against this awareness . He hated knowing something he did n't want to know . He opened the door and looked into the hallway . The woman who handed out room keys sat at a small desk near the elevator . She turned to look at him . He went back inside. 7:00 P.M. I decide to end it . Soak rist in cold water to numb the pain . He stood at the sink , left shirtsleeve rolled up . He stopped freezing his wrist long enough to prop a clean blade against the razor case . Warm water was running in the tub . Hidell prepares to make his maker , ha ha . Was there something funny about this ? He did n't think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't want to leave . The cold water would numb the pain . That was step one . The warm water would make the blood flow easily . That was two . He would barely have to nick the skin . Gillette sponsors the World Series on TV  --  they use a talking parrot . He loosened his tie with his free hand.  |p152My  fondes dreams are shatteredHe imagined Rimma coming at eight o'clock to find him dead . Hurried calls to officials at their homes . He watched the tub fill . Any reason why it had to be filled ? He was n't getting in , was he ? Only plunging the cut wrist . Soviet officials call American officials . Always being the outsider , always having to adjust . He turned off the cold water , picked up the razor blade and sat on the floor next to the tub . Then slash my left wrist . But why was it funny ? Why was he watching himself do it without a moan or cry ? The first line of blood came seeping out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't here to escape personal pressures . He was n't a guy with a problem marriage . He had solid convictions , practical experience in the world . He flopped his left arm over the rim of the tub. somewhere , a violin plays , as I watch my life whirl away . How do they measure cuts here , in centimeters ? Hurried calls to Texas . It 's me , Mother , lying in a pool of blood in the Hotel Berlin . He looked at the water going cloudy pink . I taught myself Berlitz . My Russian is still bad but I will work on it harder . I wo n't answer questions about my family but I will say this for publication . Emigration is n't easy . I do n't recommend it to everyone . It means coming to a new country , always being the outsider , always having to adjust . I am not the total idealist . I have had a chance to watch the American military in action . If you 've ever seen the naval base at Subic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war across the whole horizon . Foreign peoples exploited for profit . He closed his eyes after a while , rested his head on the rim of the tub . Go limp . Let them do what they want . I think to myself , " How easy to die "  |p153I  would like to give my side of the story . I would like to give people in the United States something to think about . He knew where he was , could picture himself sitting on the tile floor , but felt a sense of distance from the scene. and " A sweet death , ( to violins ) Felt a sleepiness . A false calm . Something falsehearted . Felt like a child in the white tile world of cuts and Band-Aids and bathwater , a little dizzied by aromas and pungencies , fierce iodine biting in , Mr. Ekdahl 's bay rum . There is a world inside the world . I 've done all I can . Let others make the choices now . Felt time close down .

He took his key from the floor clerk , who wore her hair in braids . He smelled the varnish and tobacco . In his room he sat in a fancy chair under a chandelier . He set his watch to the clock on the mantel . His watch , his ring , his money and his suitcase neatly packed had all been sent from the first hotel . Everything intact . Not a kopeck missing . He sketched a rough street plan of Moscow in his notebook , Kremlin at the center . His third day alone he ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an official to call . He tried to read his Dostoevsky . He heard tourists go past his door talking about the sights , the beautiful subway stations , amazing bronze and marble sculpture . There was a statue at the end of the corridor . A nude , life-size . The language was hard . He thought he 'd do better with his Dostoevsky . Oct. 31 . I catch a taxi , " American Embassy " I say . The receptionist asked him to sign the tourist register . He told her he was here to dissolve his American citizenship . Oh . She led him into the consul 's office . He selected an armchair to the left side of the desk . He crossed his legs , matter-of-fact . " I am a Marxist , " he began . The consul adjusted his glasses . " I know what you 're going to say to me . Take some time to think it over . ' Come back , we 'll talk some more . ' I 'd like to sayp155right now I 'm ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The consul said the papers would take time to prepare . He had a look on his face like , Who are you ? " There are certain classified things I learned as a radar operator in the military , which I am saying as a Soviet citizen I would make known to them . " He believed he had the man 's attention . He saw the whole scene in some future version . Three days alone . This convinced him he had to reach the point where there was no turning back . Stalin 's name was Dzhugashvili . Kremlin means citadel . I leave Embassy , elated at this showdown . I 'm sure Russians will except me after this sign of my faith in them . He stayed in his room , eating sparely , living on soup for a while , racked by dysentery , nearly two weeks alone , nearly broke , sitting in the plush chair , unshaven , in his button-down shirt and tie . They moved him to another room , smaller , very plain , without a bath , and charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he could no longer afford the regular Intourist rate . He wrote his name in Russian characters in his steno notebook . Days of utter lonelinessThe first snows fell . He spent eight hours a day studying Russian , serious time , using two self-teaching books . He took all meals in his room , owed money to the hotel , expected a visit from an assistant manager . No one came . He went to the visa-and-registration department . He told them about his visit to the U.S. embassy , his wish to become a citizen . They did n't seem to know what to do with him . Out on the street a small boy figured him for American , askedp156for a stick of gum . Subzero cold . Broad-backed women shoveling snow . He was struck for the first time by the immensity of the secret that swirled around him . He was in the midst of a vast secret . Another mind , an endless space of snow and cold . Lenin and Stalin lay together in an orange glow at the bottom of a stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd seen . He was down to twenty-eight dollars . He wrote in Russian in his notebook . I have , he has , she has , you have , we have , they have . Two men came to his room before seven the next morning . He stood barefoot in his flannel trousers and pajama tops , studying their moves . He did n't think it was Grandfather Frost and his head elf . The room was theirs now . He was n't sure how they 'd taken it over so fast but he knew he felt like an intruder , some kind of bungling tourist . It was his fault they had to get up so early . They were n't dressed like the officials he 'd met . They were n't Intourist people or collectors of overdue bills . One of them wore a black car-coat and dark glasses like a gangster on the Late Show . The other guy was older , in snow boots , going quietly bald . It was this second man who gestured for Oswald to sit on the bed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee H. Oswald . " The man nodded , smiling faintly . Then he sat in the chair , in his coat , facing Oswald , his right hand dangling between his knees . Lee volunteered the following . " My passport is with the U.S. embassy . I surrendered it to them as a sample of no longer wanting to be a citizen . As I told them flatly . " The man nodded one more time , eyelids falling shut . " Do you know what organization I represent ? " Oswald gave a half-smile . " Committee for State Security . We believe you 've been tryingp157to contact us in your own way . Not fully knowing how perhaps . You understand we 're wary of all attempts to contact us . A nervous habit . With luck we 'll get over it someday . " Kirilenko had light blue eyes , silvery stubble , the beginning of a sag to his lower jaw . He was stocky and wheezed a little . There was a slyness about him that Oswald took to be an aspect of friendliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the way a middle-aged man might drift lightly through a dialogue with a child , to amuse himself as much as the boy or girl . " Tell me . How do you feel ? " " Some diarrhea for a while . " Nodding . " Are you happy to be here ? Or it was all a mistake . You want to go home . " " I feel fine now . Very happy . It 's all cleared up . " " And you want to stay if this is what I understand . " " To be a citizen of your country . " " You have friends here . " " No one . " " There is your family in America . " " Just a mother . " " Do you love her ? " " I do n't wish to ever contact her again . " " Sisters and brothers . " " They do n't understand the reasons for my actions . Two brothers . " " A wife . You are married . " " No marriages , no children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A young woman , you lie in bed and think of her . " " I left nothing behind . I had no quarrels with anyone . " " Tell me . Why did you cut your wrist ? " " Because of disappointment . They would n't let me stay . " Nodding . " Did you feel , in all seriousness , you were dying ? I 'm rather curious to know , personally . "  | " I wanted to let someone else decide . It was out of my hands . " Nodding , eyelids falling shut . " You have funds , or they will send funds from home ? " " I am down to almost nothing . " " Good warm clothes . You have boots ? " " It 's a question of being allowed to stay . I 'm ready to work . I have special training . " Kirilenko seemed to let that pass . " Where would you work ? Who would give you work ? " " I was hoping the state . I am willing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study . " " Do you believe , I wonder , in God ? " " No . " Smiling . " Not even a little ? For my personal information . " " I consider it total superstition . People build their lives around this falsehood . " " On your passport , why do I have the impression you crossed out the name of your hometown ? " " It 's completely behind me was the reason for doing that . Plus I did n't want them contacting relatives . Which the press did anyway . But I did n't take their phone calls or answer their telegrams . " " Why did you tell your embassy you would reveal military secrets ? " " I wanted to make it so they had to accept my renouncing my citizenship . " " Did they accept ? " " They said it 's a Saturday and they close early . " " Your unlucky day . " " They said , Come back and we 'll do what we can . ' " " I think I 'm enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction of reappearing . I wrote them my position instead . " " And these secrets , which you 've carried all this way . " " I was in Atsugi . " Nodding.  | " Which is a closed base in Japan . " " We 'll talk further . I wonder , though , if these secrets become completely useless once you announce your intention to reveal them . " This last remark was delivered directly to the other KGB man , who leaned against the window frame smoking . Kirilenko made it sound like a scholarly aside . He leaned close to Oswald once more . " Tell me . The scar is healing well ? " " Yes . " " You can stand the cold ? The cold is n't too ridiculous ? " " I 'm getting used to it . " " The food . You eat the food they serve here ? Not so bad , is it ? " " It 's only the hospital food that was n't good . Like any hospital . " He looked down to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wearing his pajama bottoms under his suit pants because he 'd hurried to answer the knock at the door . " What about the Russian people ? I 'm personally curious to hear what you think of us . " Lee cleared his throat to answer the question . The question made him happy . He 'd anticipated being asked , sooner or later , and had an answer more or less prepared . Kirilenko waited patiently , appearing to enjoy himself , as if he knew exactly what Oswald was thinking . Oswald was thinking , This is a man I can trust completely . Factory smoke hung fixed in the distance , tall streamers absolutelystill in the iced blue sky . He rode with Kirilenko in the rear seat of a black Volga . The city was stunned , dream-white . He tried to figure out the direction they were taking by keeping an eye out for landmarks but after he spotted the main tower of Moscow Universitynothing looked familiar or recallable . He saw himself telling the story of this ride to someone who resembled Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower and Nixon who killed the Rosenbergs . The room was twelve by fifteen with an iron bed , an unpainted table and a chest of drawers in a curtained alcove . Down a dark hall was a washbasin and beyond that a toilet and small kitchen . Kirilenko said something to the other man , who left for a moment , returning with a squat chair , which he set by the table . They gave Oswald a questionnaire to fill out on his personal history , then another on his reasons for defecting , then another on his military service . He wrote all day , eagerly , going well beyond the scope of specific questions , scribbling in the margins and on the reverse side of every form . The chair was too low for the table and he wrote for extended periods standing up . In the evening he had a short talk with Kirilenko . They talked about Hemingway . The older man was the one who sat on the bed this time , still in his bulky coat , remembering lines from Hemingwaystories . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oswald said , " I want to write short stories on contemporary American life . I saw a lot . I kept silent and observed . What I saw in the U.S. plus my Marxist reading is what brought me here . I always thought of this country as my own . " " One day I would genuinely like to see Michigan . Purely because of Hemingway . " " The Michigan woods . " " When I read Hemingway I get hungry , " Kirilenko said . " He does n't have to write about food to make me hungry . It 's the style that does it . I have a huge appetite when I read this man . " Oswald smiled at the idea . " If he 's a genius of anything , he 's a genius of this . He writes about mud and death and he makes me hungry . You 've never been to Michigan ? " " I went where I was told , " Oswald said . Kirilenko looked tired in the dim light . His boots were saltstained . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat pocket and smacking it in the palm of the opposite hand.  | " We have large subjects to cover , " he said . " So : I would like you to call me Alek . " In the morning they talked about Atsugi . Oswald described a four-hour watch in the radar bubble . Alek wanted details , names of officers and enlisted men , the configuration of the room . He wanted procedures , terminology . Oswald explained how things worked . He talked about security measures , types of height-finder equipment . Alek took notes , looked out the window when his subject had trouble recalling something or seemed unsure of his facts . Two men joined them to talk about the U-2 . The weather plane , one of them called it , deadpan . They brought a stenographer with them . They wanted names of U-2 pilots , a description of the takeoff and landing . Not friendly types . The stenographer was an old man with a rosette in his lapel . When Oswald did n't know the right answer he made one up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand . They communicated outside the range of the other men , silently , without gestures or glances . The name of a single pilot . The name of a mechanic or guard . Deadpan fellows leaning toward him . He described times when the radar crew received requests for winds aloft at eighty thousand feet , ninety thousand feet . He described the voice from out there , dense , splintered , blown out , coming down to them like a sound separated into basic units , a lesson in physics or ghosts . They pressed him for facts , for names . Many more questions . Air speed , range , radar-jamming equipment . He hated to say he did n't know . Alek said they would resume in the morning . Lee wanted a sign from him . How is it going ? Will they let me stay , give me solid duties , allow me to study economics and political theory ? " I have a click in my knee when I bend , " Kirilenko said . " What do you think , old age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mean . Time to recall the smallest moment , time to revise your story , time to changep162your mind . We are here to help you clarify the themes of your life . They spent many days on Oswald 's early experience in the military , many more days on the U-2 and Atsugi , dividing every compact topic into fractional details , then dividing these . They moved on finally to MACS-9 , his radar unit in California . Castro was exploding on the scene . Oswald had wanted to go to Cuba and train young recruits . He was a skilled technician and fighting man , sympathetic to Fidel . He subscribed to a Russian-language newspaper and a socialist journal . He answered the guys in his quonset hut with da and nyet . It used to get them all worked up . They called him Oswaldovich . He told Alek about the rumors he 'd heard of a false defector program run by the Office of Naval Intelligence . They inserted agents into the Eastern Bloc , a select number of men posing as victims of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another kind of life . This was precisely at the time he was taking steps to defect . The whole scheme was written with him in mind . He half expected to be approached by Naval Intelligence . It was easy to believe they knew about his pro-Soviet remarks and Russian-language newspaper . He would tell them he was trying to make contact in his own way . They 'd train him intensively . He 'd be a real defector posing as a false defector posing as a real defector . Ha ha . Alek sat across the table shaking salted nuts in his fist . He said something about getting a TV set brought in . Oswald was surprised to hear that broadcasting started at six in the evening . It was one of the strangest things he 'd heard since crossing the ocean . The guard showed up . He showed up every evening before Alek left . Alek never introduced him , did n't seem to notice he was in the flat . The guard usually sat by the washbasin in the hall , his hat balanced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alek , like details of the MPS-16 radar system , just integrated into the network . He wanted to see how their friendship progressed . It occurred to him that the U.S. military might have to spend jillions to change the systemp163anyhow , now that he 'd crossed to the other side . How strangely easy to have a say over men and events . The other thing he did n't tell Alek concerned the false defector program . When nobody contacted him , Ozzie decided to sign up for a foreign-language qualification test . Russian . Just to see if he 'd get noticed . His rating was P for poor throughout . A doctor and nurse came to give him a physical . They listened to his heart , shined a light in his ears . They weighed and measured him and went away with samples of his urine and blood . Then three men arrived and took him to a concrete building about half an hour away . He walked into a modern apartment . They had him remove objects from his pockets . They sat him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with graph paper , pen recorders , dials , switches , etc . They told him to put his feet flat on the floor . Then they attached tubes and devices to the arms , chest and hands of Oswaldovich . One of the men sat facing him . Is your name suchand-such ? Did you ever use another name or identity ? Is your favorite color blue ? Are you an agent of U.S. intelligence ? Are you in secret contact with anyone in this country ? Is your hair brown ? Have you been sent here to assassinate some person or persons ? Are you married ? Are you homosexual ? Do you smoke or drink ? Deadpan . No sign of Alek . Oswald stood while they unplugged him from the console . He was lonely for his friend and had a sneaking suspicionhe 'd messed up the test something awful . He told them Alek had promised TV . Someone arrived with his belongings . He stayed in the new apartment for three days . They gave him intelligence tests , aptitude tests , personality profiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition of patterns and shapes . He dreamed of walking into the house on Ewing Street , in Fort Worth , his hair sopping wet from a swim at the Y.p164Lenin and Stalin in an orange glow . Caspian Sea , largest inland sea in the world , on the boundary between Europe and Asia . Kremlinmeans citadel . He is telling the story of his stay in a guarded apartment somewhere in Moscow to a man in a suit and tie . Maybe it is Richard Carlson as Herb Philbrick on TV . I Led Three Lives . Maybe it is the man at the U.S. embassy , the second secretary or consul , whateverhe is called , adjusting his glasses , listening with interest to the story of an ex-Marine who has infiltrated the Soviet intelligence apparatus as part of the U.S. Navy 's false defector program . Kirilenko stood on the parquet floor of his partitioned office in the First Section , Seventh Department , Second Chief Directorate at KGB headquarters , the Center , 2 Dzerzhinsky Square , a mass of elaborate stonework comprising an old main building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous for exterminations , other , lesser buildings , and a courtyard visible through barred windows or screens of heavy-gauge mesh . He liked to think standing up . The nice thing about the Center was the inexpensive caviar and salmon available in Building 12 across the square , and the J &B; and Johnnie Walker at a dollar a bottle . The not-so-nice thing was the heavy sense of Stalinist terror . He also hated the chair they 'd given him , a modern contour piece that looked ridiculous behind his old wooden desk . All the more reason to stand . He kept his arms behind him , left hand clutching right forearm . He was thinking about the Americanboy , Lee H. Oswald . The lesson of Lee H. Oswald was that easy cases are never easy . It made him think of the classical axioms of his early training in geometry and arithmetic . Sad to learn that those self-evident truths , necessary truths , faltered so badly when subjected to rigorous examination . No plane surfaces here . We are living in curved space . Alek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wasp165trying to get a grip on the world . Facts , words , historic ideas . He struggled against his fate , yes , exactly , like someone in the social universe of Marx . He believed genuinely in high principles and aims even if he was not yet assured of a sense of perspective . At twenty years old , all you know is that you 're twenty . Everythingelse is a mist that swirls around this fact . He slit his wrist to stay in Russia . But idealists of course are unpredictable . They tend to be the ones who turn bitter overnight , deceived by lies they 've told themselves . Men who defect for practical reasons are easier to manage and maintain . Money , sex , frustration , resentment , vanity . We understand and sympathize . We get close to the edge ourselves sometimes . They 'd been watching him since Helsinki , where he registered at the Torni Hotel , moved to the cheaper Klaus Kurki , applied for a visa at the Soviet consulate , told a clerk in passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronics . A walk-in . But not so sure of himself . Not certain how to go about it . They made it easy for him to get in , providing a visa in forty-eight hours . In Moscow his Intourist guide , Rimma Shirokova , reported his choicest remarks to the Fourth Section of the Seventh Department , where they were passed on to Kirilenko . Alek waited , let the low officials mix things up , let the boy pace his room ; had him moved to a cheaper room ; waited , waited . There were one hundred and thirty listening devices in the U.S. embassy . In his combination safe Alek had a transcript of Oswald 's remarks about revealing military secrets . Through the effortsof a clerk in the consulate section he had a photograph of Oswald 's passport as well as a copy of a confidential telegram sent from AmEmb Moscow to the Department of State concerning the young man 's statement . MAIN REASON " I AM MARXIST . " ATTITUDE ARROGANT AGGRESSIVE.  |p166An  easy case that left Alek wondering about Oswald 's procommunistcareer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would n't they want to use his political sympathies to find out what they could about the people he contacted , about KGB recruitment methods , agent training ? They would turn him when it suited their purpose . That 's when he would tell them everything he 'd learned , just as he was telling us . Does Mother Russia want this boy ? He was useful as a radar specialist at a U.S. base . What do we do with him here ? Is it conceivable we might send him to the building on Kutuzovsky Prospekt , where he would be trained , genuinely educated , in Marx and Lenin , microphotography and secret writing , Russian and English , rebuilt so to speak , given a new identity , sent back to the West as an illegal ? That 's what they all want , is n't it , these people who live in corners inside themselves , in blinds and hidey-holes ? A second and safer identity . Teach us how to live , they say , as someone else . The test results were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended toward emotional instability . Tended toward erratic behavior . Had some form of dyslexia or word-blindness . Scored fairly well in physical sciences , low in most other categories . The polygraphwas more or less chaotic but then it almost always is . Inconclusiveowing to various factors . Maybe the boy was scared . An easy case  --  send him home  --  except that Alek had a quota . There was pressure to handle a certain number of recruitments , turn up beautiful information ( or make it up yourself ) . The vital take was the U-2 data , which Alek did not wholly trust . Eighty thousand feet ? Ninety thousand feet ? Nothing flies that high . Fly to ninety thousand feet , you see the souls of the dead in rings of white light . The men who 'd debriefed Oswald on the weather plane were officers of the GRU , military intelligence , and they had n't officially pronounced on the data they 'd been given . What could they say ? If the boy was word-blind , could n't he be number-blind as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers cling to the slim figure of this Lee H. Oswald , an innocent who wanders into the outer rings of the Center , leaving thoughtful men to speculate . Are the Americans monitoring his progress ? Would they let him fall into our arms if they thought he knew important things ? Atsugi is a key base . There are reports from Hanna Braunfels , dredged from the files of the Seventh Department ( Japan , India , etc. ) of the First Chief Directorate . In a sense we have already gone too far with the boy , exposed too many of our methods . Despite all the tests and interviews , we may know less about him than he knows about us . In some office in the Pentagon , they are waiting to pick his brains . Alek was paid to drive himself crazy . One thing the tests confirmed . This was not agent material . You want self-command and mettle , a steadiness of will . This boy played Ping-Pong in his head . But Alek liked him and would arrange something decent . Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no foreign journalists , no chance to use him for propaganda . Give him a nice apartment , a well-paying job , a sweet subsidy in the name of the Red Cross  --  incentives to remain in this country . Alek had every reason to believe that Lee H. Oswald would eventuallybe given Soviet citizenship , become a genuine Marxist and contented worker , go to lectures and mass gymnastics , fit in , find his place in history , or geography , or whatever he was looking for . A true-blue Oswaldovich . Still , he would recommend that surveillance be maintained , indefinitely , wherever the boy was sent . Lee was not sure if this official was one of the men he 'd seen before . There 'd been so many , in the same dark suit . The official told him he was not yet being considered for Soviet citizenship . Instead he was given Identity Document for Stateless Persons Number 311479 . It was , anyway , a nice-looking piece of paper . The official told him he was being sent to the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if moved by a painful ringing in his teeth . Oswald cracked a little joke . " Is that in Siberia ? " The official laughed , shook the American 's hand , then clapped him hard between the shoulder blades and sent him out into the snow . The next day the Red Cross gave him five thousand rubles , which just about knocked him flat . One day later Lee H. Oswald , with a just-shaved look , set out by train for this place Minsk . Seven hours out of Moscow he caught twenty minutes ' sleep on a wooden bunk with a rented mattress and pillow . Then he ate meat pie and drank tea and could not recall a meal that tasted better . The land was forested here , silent and white in the Russian dusk.  |p1692  JulyDavid Ferrie drove the Rambler south past chemical plants where waste gas flared yellow and red . Farther on he saw oystermen 's shacks in the windy distances , set on stilts above the marsh grass . He reached a place called Wading Point , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead End sign , past the No Trespassing sign , waved to three men conferring on a lawn , then turned onto a dirt road . Men were always conferring at Wading Point . He 'd see them clustered at the door of one of the outbuildings or seated in a car on a rutted lane , four large men crowded into some nephew 's VW , absorbed in serious talk . The hunched bearing , the repetitive gestures , the set jaws and fixed regard , the economy of the group , the formal air of exclusion , bodies leaning inward toward a center . Ferrie understood the gestalt of serious talks . He 'd studied psychology through the mail with Italian masters . This was long before Eastern Airlines fired him for moral turpitude and for making false claims about a medical background . As if a degree could solve the riddle of Comrade Cancer . They took away his uniform for good.  |p170He  drove to an old lodge in the swampy bottoms where Carmineliked to relax with the boys . Four of the boys were roasting a goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the point of rustic charm , with swallows ' nests mud-stuck to the eaves . Ferrie parked in the shade and went inside . The white-haired man , brighteyed , veined , ancient , was sitting on a sofa , drink in hand . He was frail and spotted , with the drawn and thievish look of a figure in a ducal portrait . There were times , entering his presence , when Ferrie experienced a deferential awe so complete that he found himself becoming part of the other man 's consciousness , seeing the world , the room , the dynamics of power as Carmine Latta saw them . Carmine ran the slots . Carmine had prostitutes from here to Bossier City , a place where you could get a social disease leaning on a lamppost . There were casinos , betting parlors , drug traffic . Carmine had a third of the Cuban dope before Castro . Now he had a shrimp fleet making deliveries from Central America . There was a billion dollars a year in total business . Carmine had motels , banks , juke boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses . There were state officials drinking bourbon sours in his box at the racetrack . The story was he funneled half a million cash to the Nixon campaign in September 1960 . What the boys call a tremendous envelope . " My friend David W. Ferrie . What 's the W. for ? " " Wet my whistle , " Ferrie said . Carmine laughed and pointed at the liquor cabinet . The third man in the room was Tony Astorina , driver and bodyguard , occasionalcourier , known as Tony Push for obscure reasons . He and Carmine were reminiscing grimly about the Attorney General . RobertKennedy was an obsessive topic of conversation wherever Carminesettled for ten minutes . Carmine had grudges . Ferrie could see the Bobby Kennedy grudge come to life in his eyes , a determined rage , but fine and precise , carefully formed , as if the lean old face held a delicate secret within it , one last and solemn calculation . " So what I 'm saying , " Astorina said , " the whole thing goes  |p171the  pressure they 're putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to , we would n't have a situation like this here . " " That 's half true , " Carmine said . " We would have leeway , with Cuba back in the firm . The value of Cuba , you use it to relieve pressure on the mainland . But the fact is nobody ever gave the Castro matter their full attention . We were n't very sincere . " They all laughed at that . " Removing Castro was strictly a CIA daydream . The boys in Florida just strung them along . They were looking to keep the prosecutors off their back . They could always claim they were serving their country . And it worked . The CIA backed them up constantly . " " I still say everything goes back to Cuba . " " All right . But we 're realistic people . We do n't do tricks with mirrors and false bottoms . The styles do n't match . " Ferrie was n't surprised to hear them talking about delicate subjects in his presence . He did research on legal matters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also knew the answers to some touchy questions . Why did Carmine hate Bobby Kennedy in such a personal way , right down to the sound of his crackling Boston voice ? In early 1961 Carmine walks out of his modest house outside New Orleans and sees he is being followed by FBI . They tail his car , eat lunch at an adjoining table , photograph his movements to and from his office , above a movie theater in Gretna . It is the beginning of a campaign of total relentless surveillance carried out at the direction of the Attorney General . In March they go to Las Vegas with him , take his picture in hotels and casinos , come back with him , camp outside his house , photograph his family , the neighbors , the mailman , the boy who delivers groceries . In April they go to church with his wife and his niece , play with his greatgranddaughterin a supermarket and shoot movies of his sister 's funeral . It is Carmine 's personal Bay of Pigs , coinciding in time with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Sightseers come to the street where he lives to watch the FBI watching Carmine . There are traffic jams , skirmishes with thep172boys . It goes on for close to a year . These men are in his face day and night . It is the systematic humiliation of a senior citizen in front of his family , his neighbors and his business associates . And that little Bobby son of a bitch is calling every shot . Carmine said , " The CIA comes up with exotic poisons one after another . They all end up in the toilets of South Florida . " " But if we want to clip this Castro , " Tony said . " The word is feasible or not feasible . We do n't go on fools ' errands . " He stared at the glass in his hand . " Then there 's the other theory why Castro 's still alive . One of our people in Florida made a deal with him . " Tony Astorina stood against the wall across the room . Ferrie saw in him the ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those nervy sharp-dressing kids who wake up at age forty , ruefully handsome , with a wife , three babies and a liver condition , the adolescent luck and charm lost in mounting body fat . He 'd worked his way from the floor of the gaming room at the Riviera in Havana . Ferrie thought he 'd probably built some corpses in order to be standing where he was now . Tony said , " Speaking of Cuba , a couple of weeks ago I dream I 'm swimming on the Capri roof with Jack Ruby . The next day I 'm on Bourbon Street , who do I fucking see ? You talk about coinci-dence . " " We do n't know what to call it , so we say coincidence . It goes deeper , " Ferrie said . " You 're a gambler . You get a feeling about a horse , a poker hand . There 's a hidden principle . Every process contains its own outcome . Sometimes we tap in . We see it , we know . I used to run into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Orleans ? " " Shopping for dancers . There 's a girl at the Sho-Bar he 's sal-ivating . " " I was making leaflet runs in a light plane out of the Keys . A little while after Castro came in . I saw Ruby in Miami once or twice . " " Stop-offs , " Tony said.  | " He was running cash or arms or something . " " He was buying people out of Cuban jails . " Ferrie was drinking scotch and soda , same as Carmine . He was watching Carmine . They shook their glasses simultaneously , rattling the cubes . The old man 's hands were long and thin . His ears were tufted with snowy hair . Ferrie smelled the roasting goat . Tony Push said , " I remember I seen a picture six , seven months ago in a magazine . Anti-aircraft guns outside the Riviera . Dug in right in the street . Which comes a long way from what we had there . A whole city to pluck like a fruit . " " A whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradise , Havana , then . The casino was goldleafwalls . I mean beautiful . We had beautiful chandeliers , women in diamonds and mink stoles . The dealers wore tuxedos . We had greeters at the door in tuxedos . Twenty-five thousand for a casino license , which is the steal of all time , plus twenty percent of the profits . Batista gets his envelope , everybody 's happy . We let the Cubans turn the wheel . We did the blackjack and craps . What 's it called , brocade , the fucking drapes . I like to see a room where the dealers wear a tux . Plus there 's action all over town . Your cockfights , your jai alai . At the track you play roulette between races . I mean tell me where it went . " " Kennedy should have blown it up when he had the chance , " Ferrie said . " You blow up Cuba , you get the Russians . " " I 've got my rubber bedsheets all ready . An eternity of canned food . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods and dig your personal latrine . The sewer system is a form of welfare state . It 's a government funnel to the sea . I like to think of people being independent , digging latrines in the woods , in a million backyards . Each person is responsible for his own shit . " Carmine rocked on the sofa . The ice cubes rattled . Ferrie knew he could make Carmine laugh just about any time he wanted . He always knew the moment , always sensed the approach to take . This was because he shared the man 's perceptions.  | " One thing , I have to say it , " Tony said . " I do n't bear no feeling against the President one way or the other . It 's this rat fink Bobby that 's pushing too hard . I say all right . They have their job , we have ours . But he 's making it like some personal program . He crosses the line . " " They both cross the line , " Carmine said . " The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted Castro dead . Let me tell you something . " " What ? " " I want to tell you a little thing you should always remember . If somebody 's giving you trouble , again , again , again , again , somebody with ambitions , somebody with a greed for territory , the first thing you consider is go right to the top . " " In other words you take action at the highest level . " " That 's where they 're letting it get out of hand . " " In other words you bypass . " " You clean out the number one position . " " In other words you arrange it so there 's a new man at the top who gets the message and makes a change in the policy . " " You cut off the head , the tail does n't wag . " David Ferrie loved a proverb . He loved the feeling of being swept into another man 's aura . A power aura like Carmine 's was a special state of awakening . The man was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change your life , say a word and change your life . Ferrie had devised a theology based on militant anticommunism . He was a sometime master of hypnotism . He studied languages , studied political theory , knew diseases intimately , had official records of his skill as a pilot . All this paled in the presence of a man like Carmine Latta . Carmine had a battle column of lawyers with millions ready to spend against repeated government attacks . He had men working on conspiracy to defraud , obstruction of justice , perjury , a thousand pain-in-the-ass details . Carmine had Ferrie doing research on tax liens . He had state officials and bank presidents making personal pleas on his behalf . Carmine and the boys were the state 's biggestp175industry . Carmine had finance companies , gas stations , truck dealerships , taxi fleets , bars , restaurants , housing subdivisions . Carmine had a man who washed his pocket money in Ivory liquid to keep it germ-free . Now Ferrie followed Tony Astorina down a hall flanked by simple bedrooms . On the floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . Ferrie could see the square bulges the stacks of money made . A gift from Carmine to the cause . Guy Banister saw to it that exile leaders knew who was providing cash for arms and ammunition . It was Latta 's bid for gambling concessions after Castro fell . Back in the living room Ferrie said , " I 'll take it straight to Camp Street , Carmine . They 'll be very happy , very grateful . All through the movement . " " We all look forward to the day , " Carmine said softly . " We only want what 's ours . " Ferrie believed there was a genius in the man . Carmine was born in the mid 1880s to an Italian father and Persian mother , at sea , under the sign of Taurus . This was a powerful blend of elements . Ferrie admired Taureans . They were generous people , steadfastand tolerant , with a gift for empire . He carried the duffel bag to the car . He waved to the boys and drove out to the main road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of starry aspect and position , the truth at the edge of human affairs . Raymo furled the blue bandanna and tied it around the neckof his German shepherd . Stinking hot today . He had a room in alittle stucco house bristling with TV antennas . It was not far fromthe stone house on Northwest Seventh Street where Castro had livedwhen he was in Miami , raising money , finding men for the revolution . Raymo stroked the animal 's head , muttered into the silkyear . Then he put on the leash and followed the dog down the stairs . He went south toward Calle Ocho , the main drag of Littlep176Havana . Dogs ran up to fences to yap at Capitan . A lot of killer dogs , a lot of cars with hood ornaments that were the only things worth saving . Old cars sinking into the tar . Dogs skidding sideways along the fences barking in the brilliant heat . Capitan plodded on , old and remote . Raymo turned left on Calle Ocho . He walked past the jewelry shops , every bakery window with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a little corner park , playing dominoes and cards . Still plenty of time . He bought some fruit , stopped to talk to someone every half-block . It was busy on the street . Men stood in clusters , women moved from shop to shop . How the hell could you know , in an all-Cuban place , who were the spies for Fidel ? Up on Flagler Street , Wayne Elko slouched past the stumpy palms . He wore jump boots stained white by salt water and thought about stopping for a cerveza Schlitz . Not smart , Wayne . He 'd been wandering Florida for nearly two weeks trying to find T-Jay . Spent three days as roustabout and barker with the Jerry Lepke Ten-inOneCarnival . They had a sword box , a ladder of swords , a fireeater , a two-headed baby show and a snake girl with braces on her teeth . Called a dozen people he knew from the movement . Finally in Miami he received a message at Elliot Bernstein Chevrolet , where the assistant sales manager was an anti-Castro guerrilla who let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wayne . He walked down to Calle Ocho and saw the man he was looking for , Ramon Benitez , standing at the designatedcorner with a doddering beast . He knew Raymo slightly from the days long gone when exiles used to practice close-order drill on front lawns , watched by sleepy children . They shook hands , etc . Wayne said to himself , Some tough hombre . Raymo led him a block and a half south . The Cuban facade faded into a version of suburban America . Sunny little stucco homes with postcard lawns . They went into a one-story house . The radio played in a back room . They came out a side entrance and sat at a wooden table in a smallp177concrete enclosure with a statue of St. Barbara standing in the middle . " This is Frank 's house , " Raymo said . Hairy arms . One of those thick-bodied types you ca n't reach with the usual persuasion . There are only two or three things in the world he ever thinks about and he 's made up his mind about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So there 's still activity , " he said . " There 's this friend of mine who works in a Chevy dealership . He makes napalm in his basement with gasoline and baby soap . I sleep in a car in the lot . I 'm the unofficial watchman . " " What T-Jay wants is just , like you stick around a couple of days . " " I 've been looking for him . " " He 's a pretty busy guy , " Raymo said unconvincingly . The dog lay throbbing in the shade . Frank Vasquez showed up with a wife , two kids and some food . The wife and kids took a peek at the visitor . Wayne waited for someone to say , " Mi casa es suya . " He got a little charge from the Old World graces . But they slipped back inside , leaving his smile hanging like a rag on a stick . The three men ate a meal in the humming midday heat . Wayne could find out nothing of substance from the two Cubans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something serious was in the works . The meal was so entrenched in seriousness , in that grave Latin manner and tact , that Wayne was outright convincedthis was no mission to harass the Cuban coast as he 'd done so many times with the boardinghouse commandos . He told Raymo and Frank about the operations he 'd been involved in . Many fabulous snafus . Squalls , Cuban gunboats , pursuitby police launches . He described how T-Jay had appeared out of nowhere  --  they did n't even know if he was Agency or not  --  to give them special training in weapons and night fighting . They needed every little extra they could get . With Interpen , Wayne was still in the high-scream tempo ofp178his paratroop days . He was rounding out his youth . The business at hand gave every sign of being very different . A dark and somber plan . Just look at Frank Vasquez . Sad-eyed , long-faced , earnest , with little to say outside of what his family had suffered , which he narrated tersely , like a documentary of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a flash and roar that this was like Seven Samurai . In which free-lance warriors are selected one at a time to carry out a dangerous mission . In which men outside society are called on to save a helpless people from destruction . Swinging those two-handed swords . Win Everett sat in his office on the empty campus of Texas Woman 's University . All that heat and light made him grateful for the gloom of the basement nook . Here he worked patiently on his bitterness , honing and refining . It was something he returned to periodically as if to some legend of his youth , a golden moment on a football field or frozen pond , some enterprise of such flawless proportions that he could forget it only at the risk of deep-reaching loss . The office was a place to come to when Mary Frances and Suzanne were not at home . He did n't mind being alone here . It was a place to sit and think , searching for a grim justice in the very recollection of what they 'd done to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sense of the past . The fluorescent light buzzed and flickered . When the room grew warm he took off his jacket , folded it neatly lengthwise , then over double , and dropped it softly on a cabinet . It was no longer possible to hide from the fact that Lee Oswald existed independent of the plot . T-Jay had picked the lock at 4907 Magazine Street in New Orleans . This became necessary when he learned there was no sample of the subject 's handwriting at Guy Banister Associates . The files contained a single document , his job application , filled out in block letters and unsigned.  |p179Lee  H. Oswald was real all right . What Mackey learned about him in a brief tour of his apartment made Everett feel displaced . It produced a sensation of the eeriest panic , gave him a glimpse of the fiction he 'd been devising , a fiction living prematurely in the world . He already knew about the weapons . Mackey confirmed the weapons . A 38-caliber revolver . A bolt-action rifle with telescopic sight . He knew about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . The headline was " Hands Off Cuba ! " There was Oswald 's correspondence with the national director of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee . There was socialist literature strewn about . Speeches by Fidel Castro . A booklet with a Castro quotation on the cover : " The RevolutionMust Be a School of Unfettered Thought . " Copies of the Militant and the Worker . A booklet , The Coming American Revolution . Another , Ideology and Revolution , by Jean-Paul Sartre . Books and pamphlets in Russian . Flash cards with Cyrillic characters . A stamp album . A twelve-page handwritten journal with the title " Historic Diary . " There was correspondence with the Socialist Workers Party . A novel , The Idiot , in Russian . There was a pamphlet titled The Crime Against Cuba . On the inside back cover Mackey found a stamped address : 544 Camp St.There was a draft card in the name Lee H. Oswald . There was a draft card in the name Alek James Hidell . There was a passport issued to Lee H. Oswald . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service , U.S. Marines , for Alek James Hidell . There were forms filled out in the names Osborne , Leslie Oswald , Aleksei Oswald . There was a membership card , Fair Play for Cuba Committee , New Orleans chapter . Lee H. Oswald is the member . A. J. Hidell is the chapter president . The signatures , according to Mackey , were not in the same hand.  |p180A  magazine photo of Castro was fixed to a wall with Scotch tape . There was the room itself . Mackey had found most of these materials in a kind of storeroom off the living room . Small , dark , shabby , a desperate place , the gunman 's perfect hutch , with roaches on display along the baseboards . Everett had wanted only a handwriting sample , a photograph . With these he could begin to construct the illustrated history of his subject , starting with a false name . He 'd looked forward to thinking up a name , just the right name , just the spoken texture of a drifter 's time on earth . Oswald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had variations of names . He had forged documents . Why was Everett playing in his basement with scissors and paste ? Oswald had his own copying method , his own implements of forgery . Mackey said he 'd used a camera , an opaque pigment , retouched negatives , a typewriter , a rubber stamping kit . He called the work sloppy . But Everett was not inclined to fault the boy on technicalities ( Hidell , Hideel ) . The question was a larger one , obviously . What was he doing with all that fabricated paper , with a Minox camera buried at the back of a closet ? Everett flung both arms out briefly to free his shirt from his damp skin . He searched the room for cigarettes . It seemed there were more questions than actions these past days , and more bitternessthan questions . The thing about bitterness is that you can work on it , purify the anguish and the rancor . It is an experience that holds out promise of perfection . Lancer is back from Berlin . It was coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refining . It was this business of how much they 'd reducedhis sense of worth . It was a question of measurement . It was a question of what they 'd done to him . It was this business of sitting in his office in the Old Main and working on his rage . The last thing Mackey saw , leaving the apartment , was a James Bond novel on a table by the door.  |p181Nicholas  Branch has unpublished state documents , polygraph reports , Dictabelt recordings from the police radio net on November 22 . He has photo enhancements , floor plans , home movies , biographies , bibliographies , letters , rumors , mirages , dreams . This is the room of dreams , the room where it has taken him all these years to learn that his subject is not politics or violent crime but men in small rooms . Is he one of them now ? Frustrated , stuck , self-watching , looking for a means of connection , a way to break out . After Oswald , men in America are no longer required to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card , buy a handgun , travel though cities , suburbs and shopping malls , anonymous , anonymous , looking for a chance to take a shot at the first puffy empty famous face , just to let people know there is someone out there who reads the papers . Branch is stuck all right . He has abandoned his life to understandingthat moment in Dallas , the seven seconds that broke the back of the American century . He has his forensic pathology rundown , his neutron activation analysis . There is also the Warren Report , of course , with its twenty-six accompanying volumes of testimony and exhibits , its millions of words . Branch thinks this is the megaton novel James Joyce would have written if he 'd moved to Iowa City and lived to be a hundred . Everything is here . Baptismal records , report cards , postcards , divorce petitions , canceled checks , daily timesheets , tax returns , property lists , postoperative x-rays , photos of knotted string , thousandsof pages of testimony , of voices droning in hearing rooms in old courthouse buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so flat on the page , hangs so still in the lazy air , lost to syntax and other arrangement , that it resembles a kind of mind-spatter , a poetry of lives muddied and dripping in language . Documents . There is Jack Ruby 's mother 's dental chart , dated January 15 , 1938 . There is a microphotograph of three strands of Lee H. Oswald 's pubic hair . Elsewhere ( everything in the Warrenp182Report is elsewhere ) there is a detailed description of this hair . It is smooth , not knobby . The scales are medium-size . The root area is rather clear of pigment . Branch does n't know how to approach this kind of data . He wants to believe the hair belongs in the record . It is vital to his sense of responsible obsession that everything in his room warrants careful study . Everything belongs , everything adheres , the mutter of obscure witnesses , the photos of illegible documents and odd sad personal debris , things gathered up at a dying  --  old shoes , pajama tops , letters from Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trivia where people feel real pain . This is the Joycean Book of America , remember  --  the novel in which nothing is left out . Branch has long since forgiven the Warren Report for its failures . It is too valuable a document of human heartbreak and muddle to be scorned or dismissed . The twenty-six volumes haunt him . Men and women surface in FBI memos , are tracked for several pages , then disappear  --  waitresses , prostitutes , mind readers , motel managers , owners of rifle ranges . Their stories hang in time , spare , perfect in their way , unfinished . RICHARD RHOADS and JAMES WOODARD got drunk one nightand WOODARD said that he and JACK would run some guns to Cuba . JAMES WOODARD had a shotgun , a rifle and possibly one hand gun . He said that JACK had a lot more guns than he did . DOLORES stated that she did not see any guns in JACK 'S possession . She stated that he had several boxes and trunks in his garage and ISABEL claimed they contained her furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high humidity in the area . Photographs . Many are overexposed , light-blasted , with a faded quality beyond their age , suggesting things barely glimpsed despite the simple nature of the objects and the spare captions . Curtain rods found on shelf in garage of Ruth Paine . There they are . The picture shows no more or less . But Branch feels there is a loneliness , a strange desolation trapped here . Why do these photographs havep183a power to disturb him , make him sad ? Flat , pale , washed in time , suspended outside the particularized gist of this or that era , arguing nothing , clarifying nothing , lonely . Can a photograph be lonely ? This sadness has him fixed to his chair , staring . He feels the souls of empty places , finds himself returning again and again to the pictures of the second-floor lunchroom in the Texas School Book Depository . Rooms , garages , streets were emptied out for the making of official pictures . Empty forever now , stuck in some picturelimbo . He feels the souls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in objects , in warehouse cartons and blood-soaked clothes . He breathes in loneliness . He feels the dead in his room . W. Guy Banister , former special agent of the FBI , collector of anticommunist intelligence , is found dead in his home in New Orleans in June 1964 , his monogrammed . 357 Magnum in a drawer by the bed . Ruled a heart attack . Frank Vasquez , the former schoolteacher who fought for and against Castro , is found dead in front of El Mundo Bestway , a supermarket on West Flagler Street in Miami , August 1966 , shot three times in the head . Reports of a factional dispute among antiCastrogroups in the area . Reports of an argument in a social club earlier in the evening . No arrests in the case . Ten years later , to the day , also in Miami , police find the decomposing body of John Roselli , born Filippo Sacco , an underworldfigure who 'd recently testified before a Senate committee investigating CIA-Mafia efforts to assassinate Castro . The body is floating in an oil drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case . Branch sits staring . The Agency is paying him at the GS level he 'd reached at retirement , with periodic cost-of-living increases . They paid for the room he has added to his house , this room , the room of documents , of faded photographs . They paid to fireproof the room . They paid for the desktop computer he uses to scan biographical data . Branch is ill at ease billing them for office supplies and often submits a figure lower than the amount he has spent.  |p184He  eats most of his meals in the room , clearing a space on the desk , reading as he eats . He falls asleep in the chair , wakes up startled , afraid for a moment to move . Paper everywhere . They sat in wooden bleachers in the early evening watching the old men play softball . The players wore short-sleeve white shirts , long white pants and dark bow ties , with baseball caps and white sneakers . It was the bow ties that made Raymo happy . He thought the ties were fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above him and slightly to the side , drinking an orangeade . He said , " I still think of the mountains . " " You still think of the mountains . Look at the first baseman . I bet anything he 's seventy-five . He still does a dance around the bag . But Raymo thought of the mountains too . He was with Castro in the movement of the 26th of July , the starved army of beards . Fidel was some kind of magical figure then . There was no doubt he carried a force , a myth . Tall , strong , long-haired , dripping filth , mixing theory and raw talk , appearing everywhere , explaining everything , asking questions of soldiers , peasants , even children . He made the revolution something people felt on their bodies . The ideas , the whistling words , they throbbed in all the senses . He was like Jesus in boots , preaching everywhere he went , withholding his identity from the campesinos until the time was dramatically right . Frank said , " It was miserable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also because I was never sure of my reasons . When I think of the mountains it 's mainly my own confusion I recall . I was pulled in two directions . This made it hard for me . " It was true . Frank was always a bit of a gusano , with a sneaking admiration for Batista . Now they were all gusanos , anti-Castro worms , in the language of the left . But Frank was always half a worm , half a batistiano , even fighting for Fidel . Castro liked to recall the earliest days of the insurrection , before Frank and Raymo went into the Sierra Maestra . Twelve men withp185eleven rifles . Raymo knows today it was not the 26th of July alone that overthrew the regime . From the first minute , Castro was inventinga convenient history of the revolution to advance his grab for power , to become the Maximum Leader . The third baseman went into a crouch and bowed his arms wide . The old guy at the plate sent the ball on a line to left center and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was in the palms behind the right-field fence . Frank said , " I think of the mountains more than ever now . " " Because you 're stupid , man . " " But I do n't think of the invasion at all . " " Who wants to think about either one ? Besides you were ship-wrecked . " " Run aground . But still our confidence was unshaken . " " Stupid to the end . From the beach I saw the stern begin to sink . " " We still had hope , " Frank said seriously . " No wonder you think of the mountains . In the mountains we won . Frank handed him the orange drink with a couple of swigs left . They watched the old men make a double play , more serious and alert than boys , mechanically correct at seventy , in bow ties . They recalled how Fidel used baseball terms when he talked about operations . We 'll get them in a rundown . We 'll shut the bastards out . They went down the steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back seat like a stolen coat . Raymo drove his buddy home . Sure , Frank thinks of the mountainsall the time . He spent twenty-three days in the mountains . He moaned every day for twenty-three days and when he finished his rosary of complaints he went back to teaching school . Teaching the children of men who cut cane for the sugar bosses , children who cleaned and packed cane without pay . The building where Raymo lived was between the Miami River and the Orange Bowl . He parked the car , took the dog to the hydrant , then went inside . Stinking hot . The first thing he heard was thep186groan of traffic over the suspension bridge at Northwest Twelfth Avenue . It was a sound raised slightly above the natural tone of the world , the sound of someone thinking , alone in a room . The troops of the regime were afraid of the cordillera . The mountains meant death to them . For Raymo there was n't a chance in a million that he could die . He was untouchable in the Sierra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive with repeated waves of napalm scorching the land and air . They were all untouchablein their minds . This was the point of being rebels . He lay on the bed thinking . The march to Havana took something like five days . They were greeted with the awe that heroes earn in books . Purify the country was the cry . Raymo watched a number of executions . These were the rapists and torture masters of the regime , drivers of nails into skulls . They were kindly asked to stand at the edge of a knee-deep ditch . They all ended differently , fell sideways , fell backwards , an arm flung wide , an arm tucked in , but all taken unawares , dying deeply surprised . Then the communists appeared , entering the unions and rural committees . Castro gave them legal status . There were MiGs in crates waiting for Cuban pilots to learn how to fly them . Think in collective terms was the cry . The individual must disappear . He talked about one revolution and gave us another . Certain areas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russian construction crews everywhere you looked . On highways , at night , students working against the new regime spotted flatbed trucks carrying long objects , canvas-shrouded , of a certain configuration . The joke was that palm trees were being sold on the black market . The cargo was the SA-2 , the first of the Soviet missiles to reach Cuba . They were here to defend the heavens against highaltitudespy planes . By this time Raymo was in La Cabana prison , a veteran of the Bay of Pigs . Yes , like that , the bearded hero is a worm . The yard was flanked by ancient storerooms and magazines , barrel-vaulted galleries now used as cells , and he shared one of these with formerp187Castro guerrillas and Batista officers , with workers , radicals , union officials , student leaders , men who 'd been tortured by the old regime and the new one , a perfect Cuban stew . The far end of his cell faced the moat , where executions took place . He waited for John F. Kennedy to get him out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a slender man standing in the spotlight in front of the sandbags . He wore white shoes , a dark shirt and lariat tie , a nice-looking panama hat . They were in such a hurry to execute him they did n't even give him a set of prison grays , much less a hearing or trial . Raymo watched the hat go sailing off his head when they shot him . It went straight up in the air like a cartoon hat . The individual must disappear . Another car hit the iron grillwork at the center of the bridge and that low groan went up . He wanted to believe he was out of prison . A one-time fighter in the Sierra and Playa Giron , he was reduced to listening to endless arguments between Castro and Kennedy , arguments that determine where he lives , what he eats , who he talks to . In Oriente he was a skilled worker , a mechanic in a nickel-mining operation , Americanowned , and this is where he learned about the movement of the 26th of July from students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ladders picking fruit and waiting for the maximum leaders to tell him where he goes next . They carry such a stain of greatness , both these men with their visions and heroic bearing . Each takes a turn as the other 's shadow , his haunted dream . One buys what the other sells . Eleven hundred veterans of the assault brigade were released from prison after the U.S. paid fifty-three million dollars to the Castro government . Raymo stood on a sideline stripe in the Orange Bowl , three blocks from this stinking bed , and heard the renewed pledges , the second wave of emptiness . Six months had passed since then . He did not believe he 'd been freed from anything . Training in the wild grass of the Everglades . This was the only time he felt free . The thing he could not forget was the way the hat jumpedp188from the slim man 's head . The heavy thudding surprise , the sudden insult . Even after you think you 've seen all the ways violence can surprise a man , along comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to exert if they can hit a man in the chest and make his hat fly four feet in the air , straight up ? It was a lesson in the laws of motion and a reminder to all men that nothing is assured.  |p189In  MinskThe plant was an eight-minute walk from his flat . He was a regulator first-class , which was another term for metalworker unskilled . The plant covered twenty-five acres , employed five thousand people and turned out radios and TV sets . On his first day he presented a handwritten autobiography to the plant director . " My parents are dead , " he wrote . " I have no brothers or Sisters . " The director welcomed Citizen Oswald . At eight sharp the duty orderly rang a bell . Grinding metal . Saws cutting through iron ingots . He had n't realized such highpitchedfury went into the making of a radio . Meetings all the time . A large picture of Lenin looked down on the workers . Fifteen meetings a month , all after work , plus compulsory daily gym . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a number of imposing structures in this industrial city , some of them a little funny , he thought . The trade-union building had a Greek temple facade but the figures carved into the frieze were a bricklayer ,  |p190a  surveyor , a woman shot-putter and a man in a double-breasted suit , with briefcase . He ate fried cabbage in stand-up cafes . Each autonomous republic is represented by eleven deputies in the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet . Soviet means council . I am learning Russian quicklyIn his fourth-floor apartment he had his own kitchen and bath . He slept on a sofa bed . There was a private balcony that overlooked a wide bend in the river that runs through Minsk . The fifth day of every month he got his Red Cross check . He read on the balcony , wrote in Russian in his steno notebook . Thank you , he wrote . Neuter nouns ending in o take a . He wrote the lyrics of a popular song . Church spires in the distance . He had money to spend . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story . America was a rumor down the street , a gleaming place people did n't quite believe in , and they wanted to hear what he had to say . Then on May 1 , May Day , in the skies over Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains , the heart-shaking event took place . The prisoner stood in a metal cage inside the elevator . Lightproof , soundproof . This was a form of naked awareness he did n't need right now . Irregular heartbeat . Right leg stinging . An exhaustionsettling in over the raw headache , the whistling in his ears . They marched him down a corridor . Four men , two in uniform . He sensed their grim satisfaction , something meritorious in the air , some old grievance righted at last . He was due to land , just about now , along a fjord in Norway . They led him into a small room . Time to strip again . All afternoon they 'd been telling him to take off his pressure suit , flight suit , long johns , stand still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thesep191pants , wear this shirt . Then they 'd take him somewhere else and do it all over again . He knew he was in Lubyanka now , right in downtown Moscow , the local political prison of the KGB . Maybe this was the last of the body searches . They gave him another set of clothes , including a doublebreastedsuit three sizes too large , and took him to the interrogation room , where a dozen men sat waiting , three in uniform , two majors and a colonel . No tape recorder in sight . An interpreter sat next to the prisoner . A stenographer , who looked too old to record anything beyond name and nationality , sat at the end of the long table , a rosette in his lapel . The prisoner nodded faintly at the array of somber faces . Men well established in state security . They seemed to regard him skeptically , although he had n't said a word yet . Maybe they thought it was too good to be true , getting their hands on an American air pirate after four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lifetime of potatoes and cabbage soup . Maybe a short lifetime . They might shoot him in the courtyard , like a movie , to muffled drums . Bright flash in the sky , the way the aircraft lurched forward like a car jolted in heavy traffic . The long night of questions began . Name , nationality , type of aircraft , type of mission , altitude , altitude , altitude . The trouble with lies is trying to remember what you said so you can repeat it when they ask again . Mainly he told the truth . He wanted to tell the truth . He wanted these people to like him . A few shrewd lies in selected areas , if only he could be sure which areas were the ones he needed to protect . There had been no preparation for this . No one had told him what to say . He was only a pilot . This is what he tried to get across . He flew a certain route , flipped the mission switches . He was a civilian employee . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A boy from the Virginia hill country . Did n't smoke , drink or chew . Made a plane out of a cigar box for his fifth-grade teacher . He told them he 'd been flying at sixty-eight thousand feet.  |p192Once  they examined the wreckage , they would ask him about the destructor unit , which he had n't activated because he thought it might detonate before he had time to leave the aircraft . Embarrassing . They would also ask him about the poison needle , which they 'd confiscated in Sverdlovsk hours earlier . Yes , the prisoner felt a little sheepish . He was supposed to be dead . Some very important men would be mighty surprised when they learned he was still alive . They 'd spent millions to make it convenient for him to die . When the questions ended they gave him another set of clothes , took him to another room , signaled down with the pants , gave him an injection which he assumed would either help him sleep or make him tell the truth . They marched him past the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His cell was eight by fifteen with a solid oak door supported by steel bands . There was an iron bed , a small table and chair , a double-pane window reinforced with wire mesh . He was alone and could hear the Kremlin clock . Already word was beginning to spread of the missing U-2 . Bodo , Incirlik , Peshawar , Wiesbaden , Langley , Washington , Camp David . This was exciting in a way . As he undressed for the fifth or sixth time this endless , weary and disconnected day , he noticed the peephole in the door . The spin was upside down , nose of the aircraft pointing skyward , a little like a dream in which you 're powerless to move . The next day , instead of torturing him to get some answers they liked , they sent him on a tour of Moscow . Aleksei Kirilenko was present for the second round of questions . A package of Laika filters sat on the table in front of him . There were ten men in the room . The questions rolled forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerely telling the truth about half the time , just as sincerely lying the other half . So Alek estimated . No , he had not flown over Soviet territory before.  |p193No  , the CIA had not given him a list of underground agents he could contact here . No , he had never been stationed at Atsugi in Japan . What about the plane ? Yes , the plane had once been based in Atsugi . They 'd given the prisoner a peasant haircut . It suited him well , Alek thought . He had a large square head , strong features , the worried look of a rustic crossing streets in the capital . No , it did not occur to the prisoner that by violating Soviet frontiers he was endangering the upcoming summit conference . The thinking in the Center was that Khrushchev would not reveal that Francis Gary Powers was alive and in custody until the American cover story was released in all its hopeful and pathetic variations . ( An unarmed weather plane is missing somewhere near Lake Van in Turkey after the civilian pilot reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or subtract details as need dictated . But they were counting on a dead man either way . Then the Premier would mount the rostrum in the Great Hall , wearing a modest cluster of medals on the breast pocket of his business suit , and announce the interesting news , with photographs , with fitting gestures , his voice carrying in bursts over the delegates , Presidium members , diplomatic corps and international press . Comrades , he would begin , I must let you in on a secret . The broad smile , the choppy gesturing hand . We have the pilot of the innocent weather plane you have all been hearing about . We have the wreckage of the plane . Shot down by our missiles two thousand kilometers inside Soviet territory . The shadow in the sky . Sent to photograph military and industrial sites . We have the camera and rolls of film . Waving the spy photos , making jokes about the air samples the plane had allegedly been sent to gather . Yes , yes , Francis Gary Powers is alive and kicking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the poison meant to end his life , and the pistol with silencer , and the long knife . Pausing to drink some water . Seven thousand rubles in Soviet currency . Did they send him all this way to exchange old rubles for new ones ?  |p194Laughter  , applause . Alek looked forward to the theater that Khrushchev would make of the U-2 affair . The summit was scheduled for Paris in two weeks . Eisenhower 's moral leadership turns to shit . But as the questions continued for hours , then days , he began to feel uneasy . The men in uniform , the GRU , kept coming back to the question of altitude . Did n't they know how high the plane was flying when they hit it ? Had it been an accidental hit with a haywire missile ? Had he taken the plane down to reignite the engine after a flameout ? Is that how they hit it ? There were rumors they had n't hit it at all . Had the plane been sabotaged by the CIA to wreck the summit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he felt the impact and saw the flash . Sixty-eight thousand feet . It seemed the GRU thought he was lying . They believed U-2s went much higher and they knew Soviet missiles could not reach these altitudes . Why would they believe the plane flew higher than the pilot contended ? Because Oswald told them ? Surely they would have strong corroboration from other sources . In any case this affair tended to strengthen the boy 's claim to authority . He 'd evidently been right about the extreme altitude the plane could reach . He was also the one person in the USSR who had inside working knowledge of the U-2 , who was American like Powers , who could measure his countryman'sresponses and telltale inflections , who could evaluate what he said about ground personnel , base security and so on . Lee H. Oswald was taking shape in Kirilenko 's mind as some kind of Chaplinesque figure , skating along the edges of vast and dangerous events . Unknowing , partly knowing , knowing but not saying , the boy had a quality of trailing chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making riddles of his life and possibly fools of us all . Alek had never been to the United States . Everything he'dp195learned about the country made him wary of its impulsiveness , its shallow self-assurance . It is a nursery school of a culture , startled , dribbling , forgetful , compared to what we have here , the massive treasure of a history that endures in the souls of the people . Cigarettes made him patriotic . He was smoking again after six years of nibbling tiny things . At least Oswald looked American . Francis Gary Powers would eventually stand in the dock in the chandeliered courtroom of the Hall of Columns in his doltish haircut and ridiculous oversized clothes , or undersized clothes , looking like some woodchopper from the Balkans . Citizen Oswald came to town wearing his dark tie , cashmere sweater and gray flannel suit . It was nice to be back in Moscow . They led him into the room some minutes after the interrogationhad begun . He sat against the wall , fifteen feet behind the prisoner , with a security man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The news , of course , was everywhere , dominating the press and the air waves . The U-2 was the biggest thing in years . A tremendousclamor of righteous Soviet voices , historic American lies , damaged relations . He listened to Francis Gary Powers trying to handle the questions of Roman Rudenko , who had been one of the chief prosecutors of Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg . He thought a prosecutor of Nazis was a slightly dramatic touch for someone like Francis Gary Powers . The prisoner sounded like an ordinary guy . A coal miner 's son from some hollow in the boondocks . Paid to fly a plane . For three solid hours of questions and answers , Oswald stared at the back of the head of Francis Gary Powers . Then he went to the Chess Pavilion in Gorky Park to see a display of the plane 's battered fuselage and tail section . The wings were mounted in the center of the room . The pilot 's survival gear , personal effects and signed confession were in glass cases . Therep196were photographs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SHOT AMERICAN PLANE . The crowd was ina holiday mood . Oswald wondered if Powers played chess . It would be a nice gesture if Alek let him into the cell to play a game of chess with Francis Gary Powers . His plainclothes escort took him back to Lubyanka . Alek and a uniformed guard led him into the cell block . The floor was carpeted . Powers ' cell was on the lower level . The guard slid the cover off the spyhole on the door . Oswald looked into the cell . The prisoner sat at a small table , drawing lines on a piece of paper . Oswald thought he might be making a calendar . Men in small rooms , in isolation . A cell is the basic state . They put you in a room and lock the door . So simple it 's a form of genius . This is the final size of all the forces around you . Eight by fifteen . There was something gentle about Powers . He was the type Oswald could get along with in the barracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the spyhole as if he sensed someone watching . Paid to fly a plane and incidentally to kill himself if the mission failed . Well we do n't always follow orders , do we ? Some orders require thought , ha ha . He wanted to call to the prisoner through the door , You were right ; good for you ; disobey . The prisoner wore a checked shirt buttoned to the top . He waved at a fly and returned to his piece of paper . He seemed to toil at those lines he was drawing . What is the Russian for firing squad ? Alek led Oswald to the interrogation room , where they sat alone in the faint stink of ground-out cigarettes . " Now you 've seen him as close as we can get you . Tell me . Does he look familiar ? " " No . " " Do you know him from Atsugi ? " " They wear helmets and faceplates . There are armed guards around them all the time . I never got a good look at a pilot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't recall him at all . " " Did you know they had flights from Peshawar ? " " Where is that ? "  | " Pakistan . Where this flight originated . " " No . " " Powers is telling us many lies . What do you think ? " " He 's confused . I think he 's mainly truthful . He wants to survive . " He says sixty-eight thousand feet , maximum altitude . You say eighty thousand , ninety thousand . " " I could be wrong . " " I do n't think you 're wrong . " " I could definitely be mistaken . " " You sounded very sure . You described the pilot 's voice . There is reason to believe you were correct . " " Eighty is pretty damn high . Maybe I thought I heard eighty but it was sixty-eight . I think Powers is telling the truth , based on the type fellow he seems to be . " " What type is that ? " " Basically honest and sincere . Cooperating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him ? " " Too early to say . " " Will they put him on trial ? " " This is almost certain . " " Will they execute him ? " " I do n't know . " " He 'll get the firing squad , wo n't he ? " " This is not correct to assume . " " That 's the way it 's done , is n't it ? They shoot them here . " Smiling . " Not so much anymore . " " Let me talk to him . " " Not a good idea . " " I could lecture him on the virtues of life in the Soviet Union . Making radios for the masses . " " The masses need radios so they wo n't be masses anymore . " " I have an idea I 've been thinking . " He paused to assemblethe dramatic words . " I want to go to Patrice Lumumba FriendshipUniversity . " " A wonderful place no doubt . But it happens to he in Moscowp198and I do n't think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alek , how do I get ahead ? I want to study . The plant is dull and regimented . Always go to meetings , always read the propaganda . Everything is the same . Everything tastes the same . The newspapers say the same things . " " All right , this much . We will think about further schooling for Lee H. Oswald . " " I will wait to hear from you . I depend on it . " " Tell me , personally , for my own enlightenment , is Francis Gary Powers a typical American ? " It occurred to Oswald that everyone called the prisoner by his full name . The Soviet press , local TV , the BBC , the Voice of America , the interrogators , etc . Once you did something notorious , they tagged you with an extra name , a middle name that was ordinarilynever used . You were officially marked , a chapter in the imagination of the state . Francis Gary Powers . In just these few days the name had taken on a resonance , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would say a hardworking , sincere , honest fellow has found himself in a position where he is being crushed by the pressure exerted from opposite directions . That makes him typical , I guess . He spoke these words in Russian and saw that Alek was impressed . From the Historic Diary .

Russia sends heavy arms . Ike breaks diplomatic relations . Chocolate was expensive . These people had a vicious sweet tooth . Always a crowd at the local confectionery . Life was small things .

This is an angry , tired and frustrated woman . Letters to her congressman unanswered . Phone calls to the local office of the FBI unreturned . Telegrams to the State Department . Letters and calls to the Inter/national Rescue Committee . The State Department talks to the International Rescue Committee but nobody wants to talk to her . Is it really so strange that she uses the word conspiracy ? She is only trying to analyze a whole condensed program of things that are not correct .

There is a silence around him and he says he is an aide and asks her politely what the trouble is . " I have come to town about a son of mine who is lost in Russia . " She tells the man she is not the sobbing-mother type but the fact is she is getting over a sickness and she does n't know whether her son is living or dead . He is somewhere abroad working as an agent of our American government . He has the right to make his own decisions , she says , but there is a good chance he has become stranded by his government and can not get out .

" The man at the State Department says they are all leaving the office due to this predicted storm . It is apparently bearing down . The Weather says it could hit any time . Marina loved hearing English spoken . It was exciting , an adventureof a sort . She had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something fairly remarkable . The thing that people felt about America never went away . She danced with Alek on the vast floor of the Palace of Culture . He was polite and neatly dressed , told her how pretty she was in her brocade dress and upswept hair . He spoke English to some of the other boys but only Russian to her , of course . She 'd rarely heard English , did n't know a word except song lyrics , Tarzan , Spam . Marina herself had arrived in Minsk like snow off the roof , her uncle Ilya said . She was illegitimate , she was an orphan , she was drawn to people who were different . Ilya told the American she had breezes in her brain . She saw Alek often . They seemed to shine together at the center of things . They made things theirs . A certain bench in the park , near the chess players , ordinary things , not unusual in any way . They fell in love the way anyone does . They were from different worlds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , Marina believed . Her heart began to beat in a different way . They flattered each other , made each other seem unique and marvelous . It is the lie everyone accepts about being nineteen , which was Marina 's age when she met this unexpected man . She threw over Anatoly , who looked like an actor in the movies , and she threw over Sasha , who was wonderful in every way and therefore not for her . Alek had a small lovely flat and listened to Tchaikovsky on thep202phonograph . He took Marina boating on Youth Lake . They were the same as anyone , completely ordinary , saying what people say . Every fact about their lives was precious . Marina 's weight at birth was a little over two pounds . Alek was in awe of this fact . It was a private charm , something about her to hold dear . He gestured with his hands , trying to find a shape for two pounds of precious life . Her eyes were blue . Her childhood name was Spichka , or Matchstick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to speak in abrupt excited phrases . These things they told each other were like stories in a book that changes every day , giving their love a quality of never ending . He told her his mother was dead . They talked about everything , the sun and the moon , a fly on a pane of glass . He hid in doorways when the cold wind blew . There was a killer wind that blew along the river . They were marked by fate to be married and they went to the registry office , with spring coming on , only six weeks after they 'd met . Alek brought her a cluster of early narcissus and she wore a short white gown with a grass-blade pattern . That night he thanked her sweetly for being a virgin . She came home from work in the hospital pharmacy to find him doing the laundry or mopping the floor . He would not let her wash his work clothes . He was ashamed of the grime and sweat and did not like thinking of himself as a factory hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal task . He tuned in the Voice of America every night at ten . They had matching scars on their arms , his left arm , her right , both scars near the elbow , the same size and shape . A sense of destiny , or mirrored fate . He told her he 'd been wounded in action , in Indonesia , in an operation against the communists . He would say nothing to her about the other scar , the one on his wrist . He was an orphan like her , an outsider , which was all to the good , but beyond that she was not sure who Alek really was . She saw him from a slight distance , it seemed . He was never fully there . He was the other person , the one she lived with , the American whop203told her he was twenty-four years old but who turned out , on their wedding day , when she saw the marriage stamp in his residence permit , to be only twenty-one . It was some weeks later that she learned his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant told Marina that he was a good enough fellow but always kept to himself , always the loner , not really part of things , not at all like a Russian in temperament and feeling  --  not straight from the heart , in other words . The day they were married Castro won the Lenin Peace Prize . This was two weeks after the Bay of Pigs . He wrote in Spanish in his notebook the numbers one to seventeen , leaving out five and six . " The other girls I knew here , why did they want to go out with me , just like you ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " Because I 'm American . That 's the funny thing . I left my country out of protest against the conditions there and now I 'm the all-American boy to everyone . Except I 'll tell you this . When I wanted to marry that girl from the factory , Ella , she turned me down flat for the same reason she went out with me in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be arrested as a spy , she said . Her family thinks I 'm a spy . She probably thinks I 'm a spy . It 's the state of fear of ordinary life in Russia . I saw her the other day . Fat as a barrel now . " Interesting , Marina thought , how much writing he seems to do on those large new pads . What are those photographs he keeps on the top shelf of the closet , behind the suitcases ? What is this pencil sketch that looks like a ground plan of the radio factory ? He told her he was writing his impressions of Russia . And what is that thing on the wall , the little fixture near the sofa bed that seems to have no earthly use ? Is someone listening to what we say ? Even now , after Stalin , she was n't sure who to trust . Her own uncle Ilya was a colonel in the MVD . In his uniform he was likep204a painted hero of the Great Patriotic War . Alek wanted her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his salary , his duties . She knew his position had something to do with the timber industry . A sensitive post but not at all related to spies or counterspies . He was Head of Timber or something similar . That was her impression . Alek told her to find out more . It was for the sketches he was writing of Russia . Sometimes Alek rented a boat alone and let it drift along the river past their building . He would shout her name , call repeatedly into the wind until she appeared on the balcony to wave . His return wave was like a child 's , a deep and excited delight . He seemed in his little boat to say , " Look at us , a miracle , so true and sure . " Two years earlier , on a vacation trip to Minsk when she lived in Leningrad , Marina had noticed a handsome apartment house with balconies overlooking the river . One terrace was bright with flowers and she 'd imagined how lovely it would be to live there . She was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alek 's , waving , as the boat moved slowly past . Destiny is larger than facts or events . It is something to believe in outside the ordinary borders of the senses , with God so distant from our lives . Some people do n't believe in God but they color eggs at Easter just to change the pattern of their days . Postcard #5 . A foldout number . " Scenes of Minsk . " Oswald is photographed at the Victory Monument , the Palace of Culture , Stalin Square . He is a cheerful enough subject , smiling squarely at the camera , but in fact there is little to be happy about right now . His application to study at the Patrice Lumumba University of the Friendship of Nations has been turned down . He takes the news hard . It makes him feel small and worthless . The Chief of Student Welcoming writes that the school was created exclusively for youths of the underprivileged countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America . Lee wonders how they can think he is privileged . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ? Well , he has written to the U.S. embassy in Moscowto ask for his passport back . He 's a little nervous about this , considering he dumped the passport in their lap , practically forced them to take it , and then said some things he wishes he had n't about military secrets . Would they want to prosecute him if he returned ? What else ? There 's this funny little device on the wall of his flat and it 's not a socket , a light switch or a thing to hang a picture from . Not only that . He keeps seeing a car marked " Driving School " going up and down his street . Maybe his street is the site of the final exam , he thinks , except there is never a student in the car . He believes they are watching him because they think he is a false defector sent by the Office of Naval Intelligence . He easily sees the possibility that ONI is waiting to get him out of here so he can tell them what he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after he wrote to the U.S. embassy , his monthly payments from the socalledRed Cross suddenly disappeared , cutting his income in half . He took the money in the first place because he was hungry and broke and there was snow on the ground in Moscow . He did n't want to think about the true source of the funds . They were paying him for defecting , for answering questions about his military service . Now that he wants to go home , the money stops coming . No sign of Alek . Not a word . Total silence . Maybe this is all Alek . It is everything Alek . It is get the goods on him . It is pin him to the wall when all I want to do is study . I still hade n't told my wife of my desire to return to US . His friend Erich introduces him to some Cuban students and he likes talking to them , likes exchanging complaints about the dreariness of Minsk . The Cubans have a talent and a flair . There is an integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an underdog effort . Here , people use the party to get ahead . The party is an instrument of material gain . Ile is photographed one more time , wearing dark glasses.  |p206Near  his building was a five-hundred-foot radio tower enclosed in barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards with the usual snarling dogs . Not far away were two smaller structures , just as well guarded . These were jamming towers , designed to interfere with high-frequency broadcasts from Munich and other Western cities . He saw himself writing this story for Life or Look , the tale of an ex-Marine who has penetrated the heart of the Soviet Union , observing everyday life , seeing how fear rules the country . Chocolate is four times more expensive than in the U.S. No choice , however small , is left to the discretion of the individual . He has taken photographs of the airport , the polytechnic instituteand an army office building , just to have , to save for later . " A strange sight indeed , " he would write , " is the picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of robust simple working men who through some strange process have been turned to stone . Turned to stone all except the hard faced communistswith roving eyes looking for any bonus-making catch of inattentiveness on the part of any worker . " He saw himself in the reception room at Life or Look , his manuscript in a leather folder in his lap . What is it called , morocco ? He got his friend Erich to give him lessons in German . When Marina told him she was pregnant he thought his life made sense at last . A father took part . He had a place , an obligation . This woman was bringing him the kind of luck he never figured on . Marina Prusakova , herself born two months premature , weighingtwo pounds , from Archangel on the White Sea , halfway round the world from New Orleans . He took her face in his hands . Fairhairedwispy girl . Full mouth , high neck , blue-eyed flower girl , his slender pale narcissus . Let the child look like her , even that little sulky curl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is angry.  |p207He  danced her around the room , promised to take better care of her than anyone ever had . She would be the baby until the real baby came . He told her the stores in America were incredibly well stocked , full of amazing choices . Whatever a baby needed , all you had to do was find the nearest department store . Whole departments for babies . Whole stores , babies only . You 've never seen such toys . He was home first , washing the breakfast dishes . He heard her climb the last flight , getting slower every day . She had ice cream and halvah in a bag . " They 're getting ready to make Stalin disappear , " she said . " I walked past the square and it 's roped off . " " They 'll have to use dynamite . " " They 'll drag him down with chains . " She put the food away and sat at the kitchen table , behind him , lighting up a cigarette . " It 's way too big , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . " " Too many Stalinists still around . I think they 'll knock him down with chains and drag him off under cover of dark . So no one knows until it 's too late . " " They already know . The square 's roped off . Put out that cigaretteplease . " " I am doing much , much less these days . " " No good for baby . No , no , no , " he said . " I do n't do so much , Alek . " " You hide them all around . I find cigarettes in every corner . Very bad for baby . " " I do less and less now . Two cigarettes today . What about the visas ? " " I went all over . The ministries , the departments , a total run-4round . They are hopeless people , Marina . They read my mail , so I complain to my brother in my letters about their hopeless bureaucracy .

" It 's where General Walker lives . The head of all the ultrarighthate groups in America . The Worker had a headline today . GENERAL WALKER BIDS FOR FUHRER ROLE . He resigned his armycommand so he wo n't have any military restraints when he tries to lead a far-right takeover . " " Should I learn English now ? " " Later , when we get there . " These days and nights were a revelation to him . He was a domestic soul , happy in the home , a householder who did the dishes , chatted with his wife about the wallpaper . It was wonderful to discover this . He had a chance to avoid the sure ruin . It seemed so safe in these small rooms with Marina near him to talk to and touch , to make this Russia seem less vast and secret . So many angers waned as he sat under a lamp reading , reading politics and economics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant , with streetlightsshining on the river . That night they heard the rumble in their sleep . Two , three , four hollow booms , like some power in the sky , deep-rolling across the night . He lay still , eyes open now , waiting for her to speak , knowing what she would say , word for word . " What is it , Alek , thunder ? " He heard the last slow rumble . " They 're blowing up the statue of your leader . " Tishkevich , the personnel chief , told Citizen Oswald that his performance as a regulator was unsatisfactory . He was not displaying initiative . He was reacting in an oversensitive manner to helpful remarks from the foreman . He was careless in his work . He said he was writing a report . He would state all these thingsp209and would add that Citizen Oswald takes no part in the social life of the shop . No trace of Alek . No word . Not a single sign he even knew Oswald was alive . His mother found him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him a dishonorable discharge . He wrote to his brother to ask whether the government might be planning to take action against him . He wrote to the U.S. embassy to ask for a government loan so he and his family could travel to America . He wrote to his mother to ask her to file an affidavit of support on Marina 's behalf . He wrote to Senator John Tower of Texas and to the InternationalRescue Committee . The whole process of paperwork channels , endless twisting systems , documents in triplicate  --  an anxious labor for him to decipherthese forms and fill them out . He was writing to John B. Connally Jr . because he thought that Connally was Secretary of the Navy . He was actually the Governorof Texas . Marina walked in , carrying the paperback Dr. Spock a friend of hers had sent from England . She sat next to him and he translated passages into Russian . She told him that giving birth is a woman 's secret , like something that happens on the ocean floor , in dim light and silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we know the biology involved . Dr. Spock wrote , " Do n't be afraid of your baby . Your baby is born to be a reasonable , friendly human being . " Marina looked at him when he translated these lines . Sheseemed to be asking for the first time , What kind of place is America ? He went back to his letter . Could he tell the Secretary that hewas a false defector ? He wanted to repair the damage done to himand his family . He knew his rights . He wanted his honorable dis/charge reinstated . But could he tell the Secretary , the way his mail was constantly intercepted , that he 'd been sent by Naval Intelligence to live in the USSR as an ordinary worker , observing the system , photographing areas of strategic value and making note of the details of everyday life ? He saw himself sitting next to a tasseled flag in the Secretary'soffice , talking to the Secretary , a square-jawed man with honest eyes , a friendly type Texan . Dawn . Marina wakes me . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of tradition and generation , like his own father standing in a dimly lit hallway waiting for wordof a son . Word of Robert Oswald . The second son would not be born until the father was two months dead . He wrote at once to Robert . Well , I have a daughter , June Marina Oswald , 6 lbs . 2oz. , born Feb. 15 , 1962 at 10. am . How about that ? ! But then you have a head start on me , although I 'll tryto catch up . Ha-Ha . How are things at your end ? I heard over the voice of america that they released Powers the U2 spy plane fellow . Thats big news where you are I suppose . He seemed to be a nice , bright american-type fellow , when I saw him in Moscow . He put another coat of paint on the secondhand crib whileMarina was in the hospital . He dusted and scrubbed the whole flat , did the laundry , ironed her blouses and skirts . In the end the bureaucratsinsisted that the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . He moved the crib to his side of the bed and slept every night only inches from June Lee . Stateless , word-blind , still a little desperate , he got up in the middle of a spring night and wrote the Historic Diary.  |p211He  wrote it in two sittings , breaking for coffee at 4:00 A. M. He wanted to explain himself to posterity . People would read these words someday and understand the fears and aspirations of a man who only wanted to see for myself what socialism was like . It was his goodbye to Russia . It signified the official end of a major era in his life . It validated the experience , as the writing of any history brings a persuasion and form to events . Even as he printed the words , he imagined people reading them , people moved by his loneliness and disappointment , even by his wretched spelling , the childish mess of composition . Let them see the struggle and humiliation , the effort he had to exert to write a simple sentence . The pages were crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of mind , of his rage and frustration , knowing a thing but not able to record it properly . He went back to the first day , fall of 1959 , jumping right in , writing in a child 's high fever in which half-waking dreams , dreams with runny colors , can seem a state of purer knowledge . He felt little charges of excitement when he set to work on his suicide attempt in the voice of Hidell , theatrical , self-mocking . It was the true voice of that episode . He 'd heard it then , watching his own fishy blood mix into the bath water ( somewhere , a violin plays ) and he was quick to use it now , sweating in his pajamas at the kitchen table . Always the pain , the chaos of composition . He could not find order in the field of little symbols . They were in the hazy distance . He could not clearly see the picture that is called a word . A word is also a picture of a word . He saw spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . He made wild tries at phonetic spelling . But the language tricked him with its inconsistencies . He watched sentences deteriorate , powerless to make them right . The nature of things was to be elusive . Things slipped through his perceptions . He could not get a grip on the runaway world . Limits everywhere . In every direction he came up against his own incompleteness . Cramped , fumbling , deficient . He knew things . It was n't that he did n't know.  |p212He  stood on the balcony with his coffee . The breeze made his wet pajamas stick to his body . An N on its side becomes a Z.Even in the rush of filling these pages , he was careful to leave out certain things that could be used in legal argument against his return to the U.S. Yes , the diary was self-serving to a degree but still the basic truth , he believed . The panic was real , the voice of disappointment and loss . He knew there were discrepancies , messed-up dates . No one could expect him to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared about the dates , no one is reading this for names and dates and spellings . Let them see the struggle . He believed religiously that his life would turn in such a way that people would one day study the Historic Diary for clues to the heart and mind of the man who wrote it . " It will be terrible , Alek , breathing the air of Russia for the last time . " " Your friends already envy you . " " I 'll be unbearably sad at the train station . Our good friends standing on the platform . No one will believe I 'm actually going . My uncle and aunt will be so unhappy . Marinochka , it 's like a trip into space . ' I ca n't bear to think about it . " " They 'll weep with envy , I bet . " " I want them to throw flowers when our train pulls out . White narcissus petals floating down . The air must be full of flowers . " She imagined ahead . The train station , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she could go . There was nothing collecting in her mind that looked like a picture of a home . Her husband sat at the kitchen table , writing . He wrote " The Kollective , " a painstaking essay of more than forty handwritten pages on life in Russia , life in Minsk , the hardfisteddiscipline of the radio plant . He compiled statistics and asked Marina a hundred questions about food prices , customs , etc . Hep213wanted to examine the subject of control , the Communist Party 's domination of every aspect of Soviet life . He wrote " The New Era , " a brief account of the destruction of the Stalin monument in Minsk . He made notes for an essay on " the murder of history "  --  the terrible march of Soviet communism . Deportations , mass exterminations , the prostitution of art and culture , " the purposeful curtailmentof diet in the consumer slighted population of Russia . " Marina cried , leaving Minsk . A man at the train station stood watching , half hidden in the crowd . She saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend Anatoly , with the unruly blond hair , who 'd once proposed to her , whose kisses made her reel , or was it the KGB ? When their train approached the Polish border , Lee took his diary pages , his essay pages , all his notes , and began stuffing them in his pants and shirt . He had pages nestled ridiculously in his crotch . Two Soviet customs men came aboard and Marina drew their attention to the baby . The agents gave their luggage a quick look and wished them good fortune . Aboard the SS Maasdam he kept on writing . Rotterdam to New York . He wrote speeches he might one day deliver as a man who 'd lived for extended periods under the capitalist and communist systems . He wrote a forward to " The Kollective . " He wrote a sketch titled " About the Author . " The author is the son of an insurance man whose early death " left a far mean streak of indepence brought on by negleck . " The women on the ship were American and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in their company , small , shabby-looking , lugging a baby swaddled Russian-style in bands of linen . She sat in their third-class stateroom . Except for mealtimes she was almost always there . " Should I learn English now ? " she said . Early morning , June 13  --  June , his daughter 's name  --  he stood on deck and watched the south rim of Manhattan appear at thep214edge of the sea , an arc of broad buildings crowded in the mist . He was seeing what Leon Trotsky saw near the end of his second foreign exile , 1917 , the skyline of the New World . All the time he was in Russia he 'd barely thought of Trotsky . But now he could feel the man 's spirit . Trotsky was the seeker of asylum . Thrown out of Europe . Hounded by secret police . Crossing the ocean to Wall Street on a rusty Spanish steamer . Lee was worried that the police would be waiting for him on the Hoboken docks . Here comes the defector with his beggar wife and beggar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets of answers he 'd drafted and memorized in the ship 's library . If he sensed he could get by as an innocent traveler , those were the answers he 'd give , friendly and nonpolitical . But if the authorities were hostile , if they tried to put him on the defensive , if they had information about his activities in Moscow , he was prepared to be defiant and scornful . He would make an issue of his right to certain beliefs . Stand up to them , mock them , look right in their squeezed policemen'seyes and tell them who you are . A tugboat moved through the harbor dawn , and bridges emerged , piers , highway lights along the Hudson . If they could only make it to Texas , things would be all right.  |p217The  woman knew some ways to disappear . You could be alone in a room with her and forget she was there . She fell into stillness , faded into things around her . T-Jay liked to imagine this was a skill she 'd been refining for years . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn open down the side . Norfolk was a foreign city . It was where trainees from the Farm came to practice the dark arts . Break-ins , dead drops , surveillance exercises , audio penetrations . Newport News and Richmondwere also designated foreign . Baltimore was foreign off and on . But T-Jay was n't here to supervise a break-in and grade the fellows on technique . She sat on the bed dealing two hands of five-card draw and playing both hands . She was Formosan , she said , and looked young enough to be a war orphan in a public service ad . This was his third visit to the narrow room . She wore a T-shirt stenciled USS Dickson , which he had n't noticed her putting on . Her nakedness was unstriking , so natural it seemed involuntary . He could easily believe she lived that way.  |p218He  watched her crash a magazine against the wall , trying to bat a horsefly . Seconds later he forgot her again . The thing that hovers over every secret is betrayal . Sooner or later someone reaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mackey did n't trust Parmenter . There were a thousand careerofficers like Parmenter . Their strongest conviction is lunch . He did n't trust Frank Vasquez . Frank had spied on fellow exiles at Mackey 's direction in the months before the invasion . Frank was hard to figure . He had the heart of a chivato , a bleating little goatfacespy , but he was also quietly determined once he had an object in mind . Mackey did n't trust David Ferrie . Ferrie knew that weapons for the operation were being supplied by Guy Banister . He probably also knew that Banister had offered to channel cash from the New Orleans rackets to maintain the team of shooters . The larger the secret , the less safe it was with someone like Ferrie . There were others who would have to be recruited . Eventually one of them would reach the point . He knew how they thought , these men who float through plots devised by others . They want to give themselves away , in whispers , to someone standing in the shadows . He drew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poker hands . Why did he have the feeling he was spoiling her fun ? She had short chopped hair and narrow hips and a casual , almost dismissivemanner , a kind of body slang that T-Jay took to be her free adaptation of the local style . She walked like a girl shooting a cart down a supermarket aisle . " I ought to teach you gin rummy . It 's a better game for two to play . " " Why , you coming back ? " " I might . " " You might not . " " I might not . " " So why do I learn ? " she said . He liked the idea that whores were profound . He was respectful of whores . They were quick in their perceptions  --  it was a quick business  --  and he sometimes had the feeling they could tell himp219things about himself that he 'd missed completely . They had access to the starker facts . This made him wary and respectful . She took his right hand and placed it against hers , palms touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he realized she was comparing the size of their hands . The difference made her laugh . " What 's funny ? " She told him his hand was funny . " Why mine ? Why not yours ? " he said . " If the difference is great , maybe you 're the funny one , not me . " " You 're the funny one , " Lu Wan said . She matched left hands now and fell sideways to the bed laughing . Maybe she thought they were two different species . One of them was exotic and it was n't her . The beer was warm now . He shook the bottle and looked at her . " Stores close , " she said . It was Everett who 'd made the leap . Everett took the onceboldidea of assassinating Castro and turned it over in his mind , finding it unworkable and crude . He struck a countermeasure that made better sense on every level . It was original , spare and clean . The man we really want is JFK . Mackey gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could think economically . All over Langley and Miami they were still formulating plans to hit Fidel . It was an industry like wood pulp or shoes . Everett had seen the logic in staying home . The idea had power and second sight . Of course Everett did not plan to shoot Kennedy in the strict sense . Only to lay down fire in the street . He wanted a surgical miss . The second leap was Mackey 's . He made it after hearing Everett'splan , driving alone toward the Louisiana border , his sunglasseson the dash in the softfall of evening light , two years to the day after Pigs . They had to take it one more step . Everett 's obsession wgs scattered in technique . The plan grew too twisty and deep . Everett wanted mazes that extended to infinity . The plan was anxious , self-absorbed . It lacked the full heat of feeling . They had top220take it all the way . It was a revelation to him that in the moment he saw what had to be done , feeling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt the oddest goddamn sympathy for President Jack . There was fruit juice in the refrigerator . He drank some and handed her the bottle . She wiped her mouth with her hand , then drank and wiped her mouth again . A ship 's horn sounded on the river . He took the bottle and put it down and she slipped out of the T-shirt . He put a knee to the edge of the bed , watching her pass imperceptibly into a second skin . All trace of personality was gone . He 'd never known a woman who phased so completely into her body . She had a body that could reshape itself , roll itself into a straw ball , make sex a little mystery of sun-glint and shadow . He had a hand on the bedpost . They were screwing on top of a magazine and the pages stuck to her , rattling hard . In stages , through a marriage , a career of sorts as a roving paramilitary , a fall from official grace , he had become a man with no fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the stuff of paramount despair . He was getting on to forty , loose in the world , nothing to show for the time and risk . Yet here he was , starting up his car for the long drive south and feeling a curious edge of contentment , feeling charged with advantage . He had Jack Kennedy 's picture stuck in his mind and nobody even knew he was out here , a man they used to pay to teach other men the fundamentals of deadly force . Win Everett was in his daughter 's room listening to her read from a book of stories with pop-up figures . Mary Frances left these story sessions to him . She was impatient with Suzanne 's actressy moods and thought the child ought to be learning to read , not deliver lines . Win followed every word . His face changed as the girl 's did , shifting through emotions and roles . It was uncanny how these tales affected him , gave him a sense of what it was like to be a child again . He found he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched her face , believing he could see what she saw , line by line , in the grave and fatefulp221progress of a tale . His eyes went bright . He felt a joy so strong it might be measured in the language of angelic orders , of powers and dominations . They were alone in a room that was itself alone , a room that hung above the world . Later he sat downstairs turning the pages of a magazine . He knew he 'd become remote from the cutting edge of the operation . He used Parmenter to talk to Mackey . They both used Mackey to find out what was going on at 544 Camp Street . He was wary of Oswald . He only wanted to know selective things . He was putting too much distance between himself and the others . Did he expect his themes to develop in the field through otherworldly means ? He was making the same mistakes the Senior Study Effort had made before the Cuban invasion . He did n't know if he could pull himself out . He half wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear and premonition . Plots carry their own logic . There is a tendency of plots to move toward death . He believed that the idea of death is woven into the nature of every plot . A narrative plot no less than a conspiracyof armed men . The tighter the plot of a story , the more likely it will come to death . A plot in fiction , he believed , is the way we localize the force of the death outside the book , play it off , contain it . The ancients staged mock battles to parallel the tempests in nature and reduce their fear of gods who warred across the sky . He worried about the deathward logic of his plot . He 'd already made it clear that he wanted the shooters to hit a Secret Service man , wound him superficially . But it was n't a misdirected round , an accidental killing , that made him afraid . There was something more insidious . He had a foreboding that the plot would move to a limit , develop a logical end . Lancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . Then she ran water in the kitchen . He heard her looking for something on the back stairway . He heard the kitchen radio . He waited for her to pass by the porch window with the watering can . It was an old metal can , gray and dented , and he waited to hear her walk across the porch . He listened carefully . She was still in the kitchen . That was all right.  |p222As  long as he knew where she was . She had to be close and he had to know where she was . Those were the two inner rules . He heard an old familiar voice on the kitchen radio , some voice from the old days of radio , could n't quite recall the man 's name , but famous and familiar , with laughter in the background , and he sat very still as if to draw out the moment , struck by the complex emotion carried on a voice from another era , tender and shattering , a three-line joke that brings back everything . He turned another page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip . But it is definitely going to happen , said Parmenter . He wants to go to Florida because the state voted Republican in 1960 and because the whole South is pissing blood over his civil-rights program . Cape Canaveral , Tampa , Miami . There 'll be a motorcade in Miami . Mary Frances was in the doorway wearing rubber gloves , a scrub brush in her hand . " Something odd lately ? I do n't know . " " What ? " he said . " Suzanne ? Although it 's probably nothing . " " It 's not like you . " " Worry over nothing . " " She 's all right . She 's fine . She 's a healthy child . " " With a morbid streak . " " What do you mean ? " " I do n't know . Lately she seems . " " What ? " " She 's always going off with Missy Tyler . They practically hidefrom me at times . I do n't know , it 's just , I think she 's so preoccupiedlately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something unhealthy there . " " Missy 's the skinny little redhead . " " Adopted . They hide in corners and whisper solemnly . There 's a kind of mood that descends whenever Missy 's here . Very sort of haunted-house . Awestruck . Something walks the halls . I get the feeling it 's me . I 'm a very suspicious presence in this house . The girls hush up when they hear me coming . " " They have their own world . She 's dreamy , " he said.  | " She listens to a Dallas disc jockey named the Weird Beard . " " What does he play ? " " It 's not what he plays . He plays top forty . It 's what he says between records . " " Example . " " Impossible to duplicate . He just like , here I am , on and on . It 's a completely other language . But she is fixed to the radio .

' " " Are you handling plutonium with those gloves ? " " Daddy , Daddy , please . ' " He went upstairs , moving slowly in his light and silent way . Miami has an impact , a resonance . City of exiles , unhealed wounds . The President wants a motorcade because the polls show he is losing popularity by the minute . Appear among the multitudes in his long blue Lincoln , men on motorcycles to trim the crowds , men in sunglasses dangling from the sides of the follow-up car . Lancer stands to wave . It is necessary to wing a bystander or Secret Service man in order to validate our credentials . This is how we show them it is real . Plots . The ancients shared in nature by echoing the violence of a windstorm or thunder squall . To share in nature is the oldest human trick . A thought for bedtime . The watering can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Suzanne awake when he looked inside . There was a cloth-and-vinyl toy at the end of the bed , a football player they 'd named Willie Wonder , with padded shoulders and polished chino pants . Win turned the key at Willie 's back and sent him on a brokenfieldrun the length of the bed . He broadcast the run in an urgent voice , described missed tackles and downfield blocks , added the roar of the crowd , became the official who signaled touchdown when the toy spun backwards into a pillow . Suzanne showed a pleasure that seemed to start at her feet and creep up her body and into her eyes , making them large and bright.  |p224If  he could only keep surprising her , she would have a reason to love him forever . Mackey drove across a drawbridge over the Miami River . The tires wailed on the iron grid . A white sloop moved upriver in the dark , a little mystery of grace and stealth . Two blocks south of the bridge he saw the first Volveremos bumper sticker . Empty streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sidestreet and walked around the corner to a vast car lot . It took him ten minutes to find Wayne Elko stupidly sprawled in the back seat of a red Impala . The top was down and Wayne was gazing into the night . " How did I get in here so easy ? " " T-Jay . " " You 're the watchman , I hear . " " Where 'd you come from ? " " I drove nearly a thousand miles just to see you , Wayne . " " I about gave you up . " Mackey leaned against the car and looked off toward the street as if the sight of the bedraggled Wayne Elko , in bare feet , with clothes and other possessions strewn about , was a little too bleak to take in right now . " I saw Raymo and what's-his-name . I spent time with them training in the Glades , man . There is Alpha 66 people infesting the Glades . We trained with them a little bit . I never turned my back except to pee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts in Alpha . " " Are you Agency , T-Jay , or what ? " " Not no more , Bubba . Sold my peewee trailer for small change and here I am . What do they call us , retirees ? " " We train with real shit weapons . " " Weapons are coming . " " The stars are fucking fantastic . I love the Glades for the clear nights . It 's a whole other world out there . See those hawks zoom.  |p225I  would n't mind going out again . My back 's messed up from sleeping in the car . " " We have a friendly source of funds will come through for you soon . " When I was with Interpen , we had hotel and casino money . " " We have a fellow in New Orleans . " Mackey did n't trust Guy Banister . Guy was past it now , a once able man who 'd grown fierce and unsteady in his hatreds . He was delivering money and weapons but would not support the operation blindly . Mackey would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invent a target . Either way he risked betrayal . Guy was deep in causes and affiliations . He had influence in a dozen directions . It was not reasonable to expect a man like that to sit and watch the event unfold . He 'd want to take an active hand . He 'd set loose forces that would threaten the self-contained system Mackey wanted to create . He did n't trust Wayne Elko . Not that Wayne would knowingly turn . It was a question of temperament , unpredictability . Wayne had a gift for the celebrated fuck-up . He also had a nature that went violent in a flash . There was something a little viperish about him . He drawled and rambled and looked sleepy-eyed , stroking his lean jaw , then suddenly took offense . He was a man who took offense in a serious way . Scraggly and lank . Those ripe eyes bulging . An idea of himself as born to the warrior class . Mackey was sure he could get Wayne to do just about anything he wanted , just so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount of small arms in the Glades , " he said to T-Jay now . " They had me using a pistol on a stationary target . I 'm making the mental leap this is what you told them you want . " Wayne 's assignment would n't take him anywhere near PresidentJack . He would be working strictly short-range . It was a matter of fitting the man to the nature of the task . He was the intimate killer type.  |p226In  Fort WorthShe wore shorts like any housewife in America . She thought she was in a dream at first , walking on the street in bare legs , with her hair cut short , looking in shopwindows . She saw things you could not buy in Russia if you had unlimited wealth , if you had money spilling out of your closets . She knew she had n't lived in the world long enough to make comparisons , and Russia suffered terribly in the war , but it was impossible to see all this furniture , these racks and racks of clothing without being struck by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . But Marina was happy just to walk the aisles of the Safeway near Robert 's house . The packages of frozen food . The colors and abundance . Lee got angry one night , coming back from a day of looking for work . He told her she was becoming an American in recordbreakingtime . They were like people anywhere , people starting life a second time . If they quarreled it was only because he had a different nature  |p227Neon  was a revelation , those gay lights in windows and over movie marquees . One evening they walked past a department store , just out strolling , and Marina looked at a television set in the window and saw the most remarkable thing , something so strange she had to stop and stare , grab hard at Lee . It was the world gone inside out . There they were gaping back at themselves from the TV screen . She was on television . Lee was on television , standing next to her , holding Junie in his arms . Marina looked at them in life , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby on his shoulder , with people passing in the background . She turned and looked at the people , checking to see if they were the same as the ones in the window . They had to be the same but she was compelled to look . She did n't know anything like this could ever happen . She walked out of the picture and then came back . She looked at Lee and June in the window , then turned to see them on the sidewalk . She kept looking from the window to the sidewalk . She kept walking out of the picture and coming back . She was amazed every time she saw herself return . Lee stood in front of Robert 's house and watched his mother approach . She looked shorter , rounder , her hair gone gray and worn in a bun . She was working as a practical nurse and showed up in uniform , all white , with dark-rimmed glasses and the little bent hat that nurses wear . It was the official uniform of motherhood and she looked like the angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She embraced him crying . She held his face in her hands and looked into his eyes . She searched for her lost son in the tapered jaw and thinning hair . All this love and pain confused him . This blood depth of feeling . He felt a struggling pity and regret . She was writing a book , she said , about his defection . One day they were living with Robert , the next day with his mother . He did n't know how it happened . She took an apartmentp228large enough for all of them , although she had to sleep in the living room . It was like growing up with her all over again , the bed in the living room , and one night they stayed up late , mother and son , after Marina and the baby were asleep . " She does n't look somehow Russian to me . " " She is Russian , Mother . " " Well I think she is beautiful . " " She admires you . She says the place is so clean and neat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no book , Mother . " " I went to see President Kennedy . I have done my research .

" " Jeopardized . But you have given a public stenographer ten dollars to type pages for your own book . " " That is a different book . " " It is Russia and the evils of that system . " " It is a different book . The Kollective . ' It deals with living conditions and working conditions . I will change people 's names to protect them .

" The President was not available at that time but I spoke to figures in the government during a snowstorm who made promises that they would look into the matter . " " It is only an article , not a book . I am having notes typed for an article . It is so many pages . "  | " How many pages did she type ? " " Ten pages . That 's all I had money for .

He found a job as a sheet-metal worker , drudge and grime and long hours and low pay . They left his mother 's and moved to their own place , one-half of a matchstick bungalow , furnished , across the street from a truck lot and loading docks . This was the shipping and receiving entrance of a huge Montgomery Ward operation . Marina went to the retail store . She walked the aisles . She told Lee about the cool smooth musical interior . All the homes on their street were bungalows . Everybody called it Mercedes Street . The lease for the apartment said Mercedes Street . Lee 's map of Fort Worth said Mercedes Street . But the sign on a pole at the corner said Mercedes Avenue . He sat on the concrete steps out front , next to a baby yucca , reading Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She came with dishes .

" " She told you with the dictionary . You and Mamochka . " " I know this . It 's very obvious to me . " " Very obvious is only half the story . " " What 's the other half ? " He hit her in the face . An open-hand smash that sent her walking backwards to the stove . She stood there with her head tucked against her left shoulder , one hand raised in blank surprise . A man spoke to him from the other side of the screen door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in above the set of credentials lie held under his chin . Freitag , Donald . Federal Bureau of Investigation . Dark eyes and five o'clock shadow . They agreed to talk in his car . There was another man in the car , an Agent Mooney . Agent Freitag sat in the front seat with Mooney . Lee sat in back , leaving the rear door open . He thought of a word , Feebees , for FBI . It was dinnertime and sweltering . " What this is , we want to know about your period of time inp231the Soviet Union , " Agent Freitag said . " And being back here , who has contacted you at any time that we should know about . " " So if I have something sensitive I know about , they would want to hear it . " " That 's correct . " " I assemble ventilators . This is not a sensitive industry . " " You would be surprised how many people link the name Oswald to turncoat and traitor . " " Let me state I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my experiences while a member of the armed forces . " " Why did you travel to the Soviet Union ? " " I do n't wish to relive the past . I just went . " " That 's a long way to just go . " " I do n't have to explain . " " Are you a member of the Communist Party of the United States ? " " No . " Agent Mooney took notes . " Are you willing to talk to us hooked up to a polygraph ? " " No . Who told you where to find me ? " " It was n't hard . " " But who told you ? " " We talked to your brother . " " He told you where I live . " " That 's correct , " Freitag said with some satisfaction . There was a line of beady glisten above his lip . " Am I being put under surveillance ? " " Would I tell you if you were ? " " Because I was watched in Russia . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mooney laughed quietly , his head bobbing . " My wife is holding dinner , " Lee said . " How is it you were able to get your wife out ? They do n't let people out just by asking . "  | " I made no arrangements with them to do anything . " They covered several subjects . Then Freitag made a faint gestureto his partner , who put away his pen and notebook . There was a pause , a clear change in mood . " What we are mainly concerned , if there are suspicious circumstancesto inform us immediately of any contact . " " You 're saying let you know . " " We are asking cooperation if individuals along the lines of Marxist or communist . " " I want to know if I 'm being recruited as an informer . " " We are asking cooperation . " " So if someone contacts me . " " That 's right . " " I will inform the Bureau . " " That 's correct . " Lee said he would think about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . He glanced at the license plate as he walked behind the car on his way across the street and into the house . He wrote the license-plate number in his notebook along with Agent Freitag 's name . Then he looked up the Fort Worth FBI office in the phone directory and wrote that number in his book beneath the agent 's name and the license plate , just to have for the record , to build up the record . Marina called him in to dinner . He sat in a corner of the large room and watched them talk and eat . Their conversation had a munching sound . They milled and dodged , Russians , Estonians , Lithuanians , Georgians , Armenians . It was an evening with the emigre colony , some of the twenty or thirty families in the Dallas  --  Fort Worth area , English-speaking , Russian-speaking , French-speaking , constantly comparing backgroundsand education . Baby June was in his lap . Marina always looked her prettiest on these evenings . People gathered round , prodding her for news . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come here decades ago , thirtyp233years , forty years some of them . Her pure Russian impressed the old guard . She was small and frail . They pictured Soviet women as hammer-throwers , brawny six-footers who work in brick factories . She stood smoking , sipping wine . She wore the clothes they gave her . They gave her dresses and stockings , comfortable shoes . He had his book he could not afford to get typed sitting in a closet in a Carrollton Clasp envelope , notes on scraps of paper , brown bag paper , and they are giving her dental work and stockings . Everything is measured in money . They spend their lives collecting material things and call it politics . He watched them shake hands and embrace . They complained to Marina that he did not give them a human hello . They thought he was a Soviet spy . Anyone back from Russia who did not share their beliefs was a spy for the Soviet . Their beliefs were Cadillacs and air conditioners . They gave him shirts which he returned . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take Marina to the dentist or supermarket . Show her how to shop . Here is the baby food . Here is the Swiss cheese . He kept his library books on a small table near the door where they would have to notice as they entered and left . There were books on Lenin and Trotsky plus the Militant and the Worker . Show them who he is . They did n't want to hear what he had to say about Russia unless it was bad . They closed in on the bad . George came and sat next to him . The only one he could talk to was George de Mohrenschildt . A tall man , warm-spirited and assured , with a relish for conversation and a voice that surrounds you like a calm day . " You know , Lee , you have told me practically nothing about Minsk . " " It 's not an interesting place . " " It 's interesting to me , you know , because I lived there as a child . My father was a marshal of nobility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cling to this nonsense . But I am Baltic nobility , which some of my wives adored . " " Minsk , we had to get on line sometimes to buy vegetables . "  | " You prefer Texas ? " " I do n't prefer Texas . Marina prefers Texas . " " Do you want me to tell you what Dallas is ? It 's the city that proves that God is really dead . Look at these people , wonderful people actually , most of them , but they come by choice to this bleak empty right-wing milieu . It 's the local politics they find so congenial . Anticommunist this , anticommunist that . All right they have suffered , some of them , in one way or another , sometimes horribly . You know how I feel about Marxism . I will tell you frankly the word Marxism is very boring to me . It is very hard for me to find a word or subject more boring than this . But you and I know the Soviet Union is a going concern . We accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no such place . It does n't exist . A blank on the map . " George was in his fifties , still dark-haired , broad across the chest , an oil geologist or engineer , something like that . Lee liked to switch from English to Russian and back again , talking to George . He could take the older man 's kidding and teasing and even his advice . George gave advice without making you feel he wanted a week of thank-yous . " Marina says you have written some notes or something about Minsk . Something , I do n't know what she said , impressions of the city . " Everything I learned at the radio plant plus the whole structure of how they work and live . " A woman picked up June and made the same noises that Marina 's relatives used to make , shaking the baby and gabbling at her . George said , " You know , I am sitting and looking at this wonderfulchild and I am saying to myself , I ca n't help it but she looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big round head , a bald head , little narrow eyes . " " Kennedy would be better , for looks . " " I admire Kennedy . I think this man is very good for the country . " " Jacqueline , for looks . "  | " And his wife . And Jacqueline too . I knew her on Long Island when she was a girl . Very lovely child . Although he is quite a libertine with the women , this particular President , I understand . Not that I consider this a flaw . I am the last to say . But I 'll tell you about some women . They will love you for your weaknesses . They will love you precisely for your flaws . This means trouble , my friend . " Lee found the child back in his arms . He said , " What Kennedy is doing for civil rights is the most important thing . He started off badly with the Bay of Pigs disaster . But I think he learned . " " He changed . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and then they went back home . " " It 's a humiliation to me , " George said , " that I am sitting in a room with not a single Negro here . " " To face blind hatred and discrimination . " " Kennedy is trying to make the shift . Painfully slow but he 's doing it . It 's humiliating to me that I ca n't befriend a Negro without consequences among my friends or in my profession . I live in University Park . We are incorporated , a township . If a Negro family tries to move in , the township buys the house at two or three times its value . The family disappears , goodbye , like magic . " " Look at the anti-Kennedy feeling here . " " Poisonous . Young Dallas matrons tell the most vicious jokes . Their eyes light up in the strangest way . It 's clear to me they want him dead . " George went across the room to embrace an elderly man and woman . Lee found himself smiling at the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates of food before them . A man offered Marina a cigarette from a black-and-white case . Lee had his collection . He 'd written to an obscure press in New York for a twenty-five-cent booklet called The Teachings of Leon Trotsky . Back comes a letter saying it 's out of print . At least they sent a letter . He saved their letters . The point is they are out there and willing to reply . He was starting a collection of documents . She would never refuse a cigarette.  |p236He  planned to write to the Socialist Workers Party for information about their aims and policies . Trotsky is the pure form . It was satisfying to send away and get this obscure stuff in the mail . It was a channel to sympathetic souls , a secret and a power . It gave him a breadth and reach beyond the life of the bungalow and the welding company . She is the type that does n't refuse . It is thrilling to her to be given things . She will take your cigarettes , money , paper clips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a certain woman that glows at the smallest gift . Trotsky 's name was Bronstein . Half a bungalow on an unpaved street . He slept next to his Junie , fanning her with a magazine in the middle of the night . When George came back he did a curious thing . He moved his chair around and sat facing Lee , with his back to the room . He had a hanky folded to a point in his breast pocket . His tie was brown . " Now , what I am talking about is having you show me these notes of yours , whatever condition they are in , because it is Minsk and I am interested . " " It is also the system . The whole sense of historic ideas being corrupted by the system . " " Good , wonderful , you must let me see . " " It is n't all typed yet , " Lee said . " Typed . I will have it typed . Please , this is the least of your worries . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read journalsand analyzed the whole economy . " " Is there anything else ? Because I would like to see anything at all from that period . Observations of the most innocent type . What people wear . Show me everything . " " Why ? " " Okay I will tell you why . It is really very simple . In recent years I have been approached a number of times about my travels abroad . It is strictly routine . In other words you went to such-andsuch , Mr. de Mohrenschildt , and we 'd like to know what did youp237see , who did you meet , what is the layout of the factory you toured and so on . It is routine intelligence that thousands of travelers every year say okay this is what I saw . It is called the Domestic Contacts Division and there is a man who asked me to talk to you strictly low-key , friendly , of the CIA , and this is what I am doing . He is a good fellow , reasonable fellow , so on . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I come back there is Mr. Collings on my doorstep and we have a chat , low-key , with drinks . I have written things on my trips which I give him willingly and I have given things to the State Department because this is my philosophy , Lee , that I must take on the coloration , let us say , of the place where I am living and earning my income at the particular time . A country is like a business to me . I move from one to another as opportunity dictates . I will learn Croatian in Yugoslavia . I will learn the French patois as the Haitians speak it . This is how I survive as someone who has come through a revolution and a world war and so on . I am always willing to cooperate . I take on the coloration . It is my message to them that I am not the enemy . A necessary gesture . I am not in the market to be persecuted . In other words here is my itinerary , here are my notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be friends . " " It is n't all typed . " " Please , I have my consulting firm , you know , with paper , pencils and a girl who types . I will give you a copy , of course , plus the original notes . " " You will also give a copy to Mr. Collings . " " This is understood . They collect and analyze . It can be helpful to someone in your position if you cooperate . Let 's face it , you are in a cramped position . If I am a Mr. Collings and I see cooperation from an individual who can use and appreciate a better-paying job , then I am inclined to make a call . This happens all the time . " Lee bounced the child on his knee to quiet her down . " Also , George , I would like to publish The Kollective . ' " " I would advise you no . I would say no , this is not right for you at this time . Let us look at the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or another , I guarantee this . These people have a thousand ways . They reach across the world . It 's amazing . How do you think you re-entered this country ? When a person defects , his name is put on the FBI 's watch list . There is a lookout card that is prepared in such cases . But they returned your passport . They let Marina in . They gave you a loan and let you in . " " They were keeping an eye all that time . " " They 're still keeping an eye . You 're an interesting individual . I 'm sure they would very much like to learn about your contacts in the Soviet Union . We 'll have a nice talk , you and I , in private somewhere , without the baby listening in . " George laughed . They both laughed . First Freitag and his partner , now this man Collings . They were swarming all over him like ants on a melon rind . He looked at Marina . She was standing slightly curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoke she looked windscrubbedand fresh . Never love me for my weaknesses , he wanted to say . Never take the blame for me . Never think it is your fault when I am the one . I am always the one . He slapped her on the side of the head and she took half a swing at him . He sat down and opened a magazine . She could tell he was turning the pages without really looking . She wanted something to throw . She grabbed a sheet of paper and crumpled it up and threw it at him . It bounced off his arm but he did n't react . She went to the table and ate some of her dinner , looking at him . She stared hard . She wanted to make him uncomfortable , make it hard for him to read . She felt stupid , throwing a piece of paper . " No cigarettes , " he said . " I do not want you smoking . That is period , forever . " " If I want to smoke once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very bad . You could not fill my bathtub ? It is too much to come home , for me to expect a warm bath is ready , after a day of noise and sweat . "  | " I do n't smoke too much . It is reasonable , what I smoke . " " Lazy , lazy girl . " " I make dinner . I scrub on my knees . " " I scrub on my knees , " he said . He flung the magazine sidearm , whipped it hard against the wall . The baby started in to cry . He got up and walked over to Marina . " I scrub on my knees , " he said . He hit her in the face . She sat in the chair , with leftover food in her plate . " I scrub on my knees . " She covered up . He hit her again . Then he went back to his chair and picked up a book . She took the plate of leftovers to the sink and left it there without scraping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for him to clean . He would do it too . There was always something lying around after a fight that he would carefully clean . " You tell those Russians how we live our lives , about our sex , our private lives . " " This is how friends communicate , " she said . " Everything is public for you . " " I trust friends , that they understand how things are . Who else do I talk to ? I need these friends . " " You do n't need to tell our private life . I do n't want them coming here . Keep them out . " " I must keep your mother out . I must keep my friends out . " " My own brother told the FBI . " " It 's no secret where we live . What did he tell ? People know where we live . We ca n't hide where we live . " He read the book . She turned on the tap and watched water swirl into the drain . The baby was crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not really talking to her . " Teach me English . " " You wait for them to refill your wine . " " I never loved you . I took pity on a foreigner . " " Meanwhile cigarettes . "  | " I tell my friends how you hit me . He does n't hit so hard . It 's just that I have soft skin . That 's why they see the marks . " She was standing at the sink with her back to the room . She heard him get up and come toward her . She picked up a sponge and began cleaning the edges of the sink . He hit her in the side of the face . He stood there a moment , deciding whether one was enough . Then he went and sat down and she wet the sponge and worked a stain out of the countertop . They were unloading across the street . She heard truck engines , men 's voices . She had another bite of leftovers and cleaned the windowsill behind the sink . " I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lightly . It 's only my fair skin that makes it look so bad . " He came over and started pummeling her on both arms . She turned off the tap . He hit her high on the arms , using open hands . " I tell them it is n't his fault if I bruise so easily . " She put her hands to the sides of her head for protection . He kept hitting her on the upper arms like some kid 's game of slap-thearm . He hit in rhythm , hitting with the right hand , then the left . He worked quietly behind her , one and a-two , breathing through his nose . She could feel the labor of his concentration . She lay in the dark and thought of the paper she 'd crumpled and thrown . It was lesson number seven . An elderly man in the Russian colony sent her pages in the mail to improve her English . At the top of the first page he wrote in large , large letters , in Russian , My name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . Lesson number two , I live in Fort Worth . Lesson number three , We buy groceries on Tuesday . Each lesson had its own page . She mailed him the finished pages and he corrected them and mailed them back , with new lessons for her to work on . Now lesson seven was crumpled and he would wonder how it happened . Lee came out of the bathroom and got into bed . She felt how he carefully eased into bed so he would n't disturb her if she was asleep . She was facing away from him , of course.  |p241She  thought of Holland again . This was a recent thing , out of nowhere , thinking of Holland , of their train journey across Europe and her surprise at seeing Dutch villages and hearing church bells ring . It is the cleanest country in the world , unbelievably clean , with cozy houses and spotless streets and fences in the meadows that are perfectly straight . She did n't want her baby sucking nervous milk . She thought they would have a life that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had matching scars on the arm , which meant they were marked by fate to meet and fall in love . She thought of walking the aisles of Montgomery Ward . She went in out of the heat to piped-in music and little ringing bells . The floors were polished . The aisles were immensely long , bordered with cosmetics in display cases and counters full of shiny handbags , with dresses spreading into other rooms . Fragrances drifting everywhere . He wanted to go to college at night and take courses in politics and economics . But there was the need to make a living which interfered . She saw him from a distance even when he was hitting her . He was never fully there . Mamochka bought her modest shorts , pleated , with deep pockets . This was a difference of opinion . She knew he was trying to sense if she was awake . He was on the verge of saying something or leaning over to touch . He would probably touch , rise on an elbow and touch her on the hip with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airstream in the dark . It was absolutely there . He was waiting , thinking if this was the time . His own wife and he had to think . She thought of Holland again . She thought of landing in New York . One night in a hotel in the middle of cascading neon . Rivers and lakes of neon . He is someone you see from a distance . Fragrances . The floors remarkably clean . She stood in an area with ' IVs stacked everywhere . She watched TV half the morning ,  |p242five  different programs side by side . She walked the aisles . It was cool and peaceful . Nobody talked to you unless you asked a question or made a purchase and she did n't have the means of doing either . He went out to find food and she was alone with the baby in New York , an old hotel , and she took a washcloth and cleaned the grime off the venetian blinds . She sensed he was going to touch , he was making up his mind to touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were brought together by fate but she was n't sure who he really was . Sharing the bathroom she was n't sure . Making love she did n't know who he was . When she learned English he would be less distant . It was absolutely true . We buy groceries on Tuesday . They made love , when they did , in a tender way , full of honest forgiving . There is a broadsheet plastered crookedly to a wall near their bungalow . THE VATICAN IS THE WHORE OF REVELATION . Lee translates for Marina . Marguerite was calm . She stood at the ironing board running the iron over her uniform blouse . She faced the living room , which had a sofa with a mound of bright pillows , two comfortable chairs , a writing desk and TV set and a decorative stand with ivy twisting out of a long pot . She ironed the uniform every chance , keeping it crisp and fresh . She worked in other people 's homes , by word of mouth , some of the best homes in Fort Worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mentioned to the woman that it is two weeks to Lee 's birthday and he does n't have work clothes , so she said , " Mrs. Oswald , what build is he ? " And I told her . And he was about the samep243build as her husband . And she got out the work clothes her husband did n't want , some worn-out pairs of pants , she wanted me to pay , for ten dollars . Here is a woman , she knows I make a hard living , she knows they are a young couple starting a home in a new country . This is being rich in Fort Worth , asking payment from a nurse for used clothing . I am calm about it today , your honor , but this to me is very strong in my mind , that here is another instance of a troubled situation . Because from the very first day I looked in his face and saw a different boy . And I was like , What have they done to my boy over there ? Because his skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was drawn , a tint of sand to a tint of ash gray . Because his hair was kinky out of nowhere . Because his hair was coming out , which he says himself , from a full head of hair to badly thinning in front that you could practically see his scalp . We had him bend his head down , Robert and I , to where we could actually look at the top of his head in a bright light . Judge , this is a family where the men have always displayed full heads of hair and he is still a boy . He said it is the cold of Russia . I thought to myself it is shock treatments . This is my conclusion , his being an agent of our government and lost for a year . There are many ways this figures out , remembering the incident where we sat watching the television in my apartment on West Seventh Street after she came home with a cancan petticoat and some hose that Lee bought with a few dollars from Robert and me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mama , it is Gregory Peck , " and I looked at the movie and it was Gregory Peck sifting on a horse . Now , about my suspicions does a foreign girl know movie stars ? I think it is frankly something to examine . I know I have not traveled abroad but when I think of Minsk and the frozen cold , where are the movie magazines in this city ? Where are the theaters that show our American West ? I am a person who plunges straight into things and this is an incident that shows the character of what I am trying to bring out . Who is this girl and what is she doing here ? Is this girl trained to know more than she lets on ? I try to talk to Lee about is he happy , does she run a proper household , because there are ap244lot of Russian friends who are established , with cars and homes , that have publicly interfered . They could not see this Russian girl do without . She pictured America in her mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am calm about it today but I am the one who bought her a little longer shorts . The Lord would know me for a liar if I said I stopped bringing things after he told me to stop , but it was only the shorts and the parakeet , and the parakeet was just to give a touch of color because it was bright green , to color up a home in a new country . He freed the parakeet . He opened the cage and let it go . The boy who adored animals , judge . But about the shorts it is , " No , Mama , I no like . " And I said , " Marina , you are a married woman and it is proper for you to have a little longer shorts than the younger girls . " But it is , " No , Mama , this no good . " And I am strongly saying that this girl was not home . And this man was working . And I saw myself that this man came home and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple does not have a maid to give this workingman his supper . We are a family that has struggled to stay together . His daddy collected insurance premiums right up to the moment he went down on the lawn , mowing the lawn in a raging heat . It is Marguerite and Lee ever since . A family expects you to be one thing when you 're another . They twist you out of shape . You have a brother with a good job and a nice wife and nice kids and they want you to be a person they will recognize . And a mother in a white uniform who grips your arms and weeps . You are trapped in their minds . They shape and hammer you . Going away is what you do to see yourself plain . It was a Sunday and he stood in the empty lobby of the Republic National Bank Building in Dallas . Tan marble everywhere . He was waiting for George de Mohrenschildt . This was the second time hep245was meeting George . He wore a clean white shirt and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store in Minsk . George had a handful of keys . He jiggled them in greeting and walked to the elevators . They rode to sixteen and went down deserted corridors . The air was heavy and dense , with a carpet smell , a closeness . George was in tennis shorts and a shirt with an alligator emblem . He had a nice-size office with diplomas on the wall . " You 've been reading about this nut-case general . " " I know about him since Russia , " Lee said . " He 's getting involved in Cuba now . Sit down . I have your papers . " He 's only reflecting the feelings of what most people think . What Walker says and does , this is white America . " " There are missiles poised to demolish us all and we have to open the newspaper and see this man . " " It is Mississippi , it is Cuba , it is wherever he sees the oppor-tunity . " " He is making a switch to Cuba . He will jump into the Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking questions about my mail , " Lee said . " What do you mean ? " " A postal inspector talked to my landlord about the type mail I get . " " What type mail ? " " What some people would say subversive . " " Why do you read this material ? It is totally boring material . I know this material without reading a word . It is the definition of boring . " " They are coming at me from a number of angles , " Lee said , breathing a little laugh through his nose . George gave him a copy of the material that had been typed since their last talk . He returned the original handwritten pages , page fragments , random notes , autobiographical notes , notes for speeches.  | " I 'm not disappointed , Lee . This is solid work , the main essay in particular . I think it is definitely a prospect that you move here to Dallas with a new job , something more suited . You 'll come to my house . You 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most interesting thing about the house where I live . It is less than two miles from the house of General Walker . " George stuck out his index finger and raised his thumb . The door opened and a tall man with cropped gray hair walked in . He was very tan and wore a tan suit with a blue shirt and he had to be Marion Collings . George introduced them . Collings had the spare build , the leanness and fitness of an older man who wants you to know he is determined to outlive you . George left . " This essay you 've written , " Collings said . " Very impressive , very thorough . I appreciate the fact you 've allowed us to see it . - You picked up things only a trained observer ordinarily spots . Many interesting facts about the radio plant and the workers . Well organized , a nice grasp of social interplay . I would say a good beginning . We have something solid to start us out .

" " I had an interview with Internal Affairs , MVD , as final clearancefor my departure . " " Who cleared your entry ? You applied for a visa in Helsinki and had it in two days . Normally a week is what it takes . We happen to know the Soviet consul in Helsinki at that time was a KGB officer . " " You may know it but I did n't . They 're all over the place . That does n't mean I was doing any business . I went there to seek a better life .

Supply some details is all we 're looking for . We 're not the FBI . We do n't pursue with a vengeance , or apprehend and prosecute . We want a relationship . A give-and-take , okay ? " " Is the FBI watching me ? " " I would n't know , " Collings said . " How would I know a thing like that ? " It was as if he 'd been asked the melting point of titanium . " Look , it 's simple .

We 're sitting in a forty-story building that has an exteriorof lightweight embossed aluminum . So what ? Well , these dullish facts can mean a lot to certain individuals at certain times . An old man eating a peach is intelligence if it 's August and the place is the Ukraine and you 're a tourist with a camera . I can get you a Minox incidentally , any time .

" It 's a job I guarantee you are suited for and you 'll be working there in a matter of days . Okay . Just tell me what to do . " Minox is the world-famous spy camera . Hidell has seen the name in books . He walked through empty downtown Dallas , empty Sunday in the heat and light . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaster isolation than Russia , stranger dreams , a dead white glare burning down . He wanted to carry himself with a clear sense of role , make a move one time that was not disappointed . He walked in the shadows of insurance towers and bank buildings . He thought the only end to isolation was to reach the point where he was no longer separated from the true struggles that went on around him . The name we give this point is history.  |p24912  AugustBrenda Jean Sensibaugh , known professionally as Baby LeGrand , sat at the vanity in the dressing room of the Carousel Club , putting flesh-tone ointment on a pimple near her mouth . The narrow table was crowded with hairbrushes , coffee cups , thermos bottles , makeup kits , eight-by-ten glossies , sprays and foams , boxes of Kleenex , and it extended the length of the room , supporting four unframed mirrors . Brenda wore a bathrobe belonging to her sister . Life Line was on KRLD , a patriotic show where they hiss at federal spending . To get the ointment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of her mouth , bulging the face , and this made it hard to talk . She was talking to the girl at the next mirror , Lynette Batistone , who looked barely out of high school . " He might let you have an advance , " Brenda said . " Only make sure he 's in a good mood when you ask . " " I heard about his advances , " Lynette said . " This is just Jack . It 's not , he does n't expect results in other words . Who all 'd you talk to , honey ? "  | " Molly Bright was saying . " " Never mind Molly . The thing of Jack is , he gets personal with words . This is the windbag of the world talking . But it 's not like you have to fight your way out of the club . " " From what I hear . But this is strictly , you know . " " What ? " " He threatens his girls with , Dumb cunt , ' like , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Honey , all right , this is not a bookkeeping firm . What 's a little language ? " " He gets screaming fits all the time , " Lynette said . " He will not put a hand on your body . " " Molly Bright offered she would fill in for Blaze and what happens , there 's this pandemonium . " " You want to quote Molly . Let me say about Molly . If bullshit was music , she 'd be a brass band . You need the money bad , go tell Jack . Just be sure to mention groceries . He reacts to anything concerningfood . " Lynette was in costume , a cowgirl outfit with a riding crop and long-barreled pistol . Brenda thought the girl had talent but not an ounce of taste . What she did was not even striptease . She was doing the dirty dog basically , with added little struts and touches . " They told me in New Orleans this Jack is up and coming . " " He owns another club . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Vegas , " Brenda said . " But I do n't know about up and coming . I have to think on that a little . " " What are these dogs I keep seeing ? " " He has dogs he calls his family . They live at the club except for one he takes home . " " This is in case of protection . " " I do n't know what he 's got to protect here but just us strippers . " " I got ta go wee , " Lynette said . " The other thing of Jack is , he 'll ask you if he 's queer . Do you think I 'm queer , Lynette ? ' Do I look like I 'm queer to you ? '  |p251Serious  , tell me , do I strike you as queer from your experience ? ' I guarantee he will ask these questions . How surprised would you be if someone told you I 'm a queer ? " Do I talk the way a queer might talk if he 's trying to hide it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to tell him ? " Lynette said . " Does n't make the slightest little difference . This is just Jack . " Jack Ruby came in off Commerce Street , paunchy , balding , bearish in the chest and shoulders , fifty-two years old , carrying three thousand dollars in cash , a loaded revolver , a vial of Preludins and a summons from small-claims court for passing a bad check in a department store . He walked into the dressing room . " Quiet , " he told Brenda . " I want to hear this . " They listened to Life Line on the radio . It was a commentary on heroism and how it has fallen into disuse . Jack sat at the second mirror , his head lowered for maximum listening . The announcer said , " In America , not so long ago , thirty-five bright young university students in a history class were asked to identify Guadalcanal . Less than one-third of them had ever heard of it . Three thousand years of military history tell no story more splendid than the blazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as truly American as the log-cabin frontier and the open range . But nobody hears it now . United Nations Day gets a hundred times the publicity . " Jack was wearing a dark suit , white shirt and white silk tie , and he carried the snap-brim fedora that put him into focus , gave him sharpness and direction , like a detective on assignment . " I love this stuff , " he said . " I get welled up something tremendouswhen they talk about our country . You should have seen me when FDR died , when they announced on the radio , I was in uniform crying like a baby . Where is this Randi Ryder of mine ? "  --  Faking a pee . "  | " Is she torrid or what ? I do n't know what to do . I 'm afraid they 'll take my license . " " This is striptease , " Brenda said . " She was a big draw on Bourbon Street . But this is , I do n't know , they might think she goes too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is after publicity , Jack . " " I could make her wear a different little doohickey there . " " She would snap it and pop it whatever . " " Dallas draws the line at pussy hair . She could get me closed down . " " She is awful young to me . " " That 's part of the draw . The competition 's breathing down my back . " " Is that why you 're paying her more than us ? " Jack leaned away , incredulous . " Do I know this ? " he said . " When did this come out ? " " You are paying Lynette like double . " " Brenda , I swear this sounds like something I never heard of . I am claiming I am nowhere on this . " " You pay extra , then you complain she 'll close you down . " " I give her the margin so she 'll draw . I need the draw very bad . " " You have this big thing built up in your mind that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just the competition , making a living like the rest of us . " " Fuck you , Brenda , okay . " " Same back , Mr. Ruby . " " I 'm only the owner of this establishment and I have to sit here . " " That is exactly right . " " I have to listen . " " They have nothing better to do than get Jack . When Jack is the biggest conniver and sharpie of all . " " Hand me a Kleenex , " he said.  | " I also have to say . Now that I 'm started . You 're always off somewhere in your mind . Carrying on your own conversation . You do n't listen to people . " " You do n't know how deep they 're digging me . " " That 's why there is all this yelling all night long in this place . " " I have my dogs and I. " " Which you 're very welcome . " " You should know my early life , Brenda , which I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , I swear to God , she spent thirty years of her life claiming there was a fishbone stuck in her throat . We listened to her constantly . Doctors , clinics , they searched for years with instruments . Finally she had an operation . There was nothing caught in her throat , absolutely , guaranteed . She comes home from the hospital . The fishbone is there . " " Well this is just a woman and a mother . " " So help me , thirty years , my brothers and sisters , never mind . And that 's the least of it . I 'm just showing you some idea . My father was the drunk of all time . But I do n't care anymore what they did to each other or to me . I 'm not a person who maintains a malice . I feel only love and respect for those people because they suffered in this world . So forget it , I do n't care , go away . " " You never married , Jack , but how come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Personal-appearance-wise , you dress and groom . " " In my heart , Brenda . There 's a chaos that 's enormous . " They heard the MC telling jokes out on the stage . Jack leaned toward the radio and listened some more . " I love the patriotic feeling I get , hearing this stuff . I am one hundred percent in my feeling for this country . What else do I trust ? My own voice goes creepy at times . I ca n't control the inner voice . There are pressures unbelievable . " " Everybody gets pressure . We get pressure . You work us seven days a week . " " I 'm about halfway out of it in common terms . "  | " Why do n't you marry your Randi Ryder ? She 'll straighten out your life . " " She 's a famous lay in New Orleans but she wo n't do anything unnatural . " Somebody shouted around the corner . Visitor for Jack . He touched Brenda on the shoulder and went out of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karlinsky was sitting on the sofa with one of the dogs . " This is my dachshund Sheba , " Jack Ruby said . " Get down , baby . " Jack Karlinsky was in his sixties , an investment counselor who had no office , no business phone , no employees and no clients . At his twenty-room house outside Dallas , a Coast Guard fog light played over the grounds all night long . " I want to know did you hear . " " Be calm , Jack . That 's why I 'm here . To discuss terms . " " There are people who 'll speak for me out of long association . I talk to Tony Astorina on the phone . " " I know you have connections , " Karlinsky said . " But this is not the same as so-and-so is connected . " " What is Cuba , nothing ? " " I understand full well you took some trips for people . " " This is when Cuba was popular in the press . " " You did some things for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? Is this something I 'm just hearing ? " " Please . You volunteered your services to the FBI in March1959 . They opened a file . " " Jack , you know as well as I. " " Potential criminal informant . You informed a little bit here , a little bit there . " " This is for my own protection in case something is held against me , so I can say look . " " Jack , it means nothing to me personally . I appreciate you are known in New Orleans , you are known in Dallas . You are a constant face in Dallas . " " I have associations going back to the old Chicago days whichp255I am prouder of than anything in my life , Newberry Street , Morgan Street , the pushcarts , the gangs . " " We all love the old Chicago stories . What do you think I was born here ? Nobody is born in Dallas . We all carry the old Chicago thing , and the street life , and the scrappy days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the boys are naturally picky who gets the use of their capital . " Jack went through his desk drawers . " Look , I can show you notices of tax liens , rejections of compromiseoffers . They 're all over me about excise taxes . I am getting killed , Jack . They have history sheets on me this thick . I keep running in to pay cash in trickles . Two hundred dollars , two hundred and fifty dollars . In other words to show them some concern . But it 's like a kid on an errand . I am in for over forty-four thousand dollars to the IRS alone and on top of that there is this union that wants me to ease up on the hours of the girls , there is this competitionnext door that is killing me with amateur nights and there is this girl from New Orleans that 's gon na close me down for popping her G-string .

Jack checked out the shoes and haircut . He admitted left and right he was still learning how to live . " I am telling my lawyer to settle eight cents on the dollar . " " Jack , they will tell you . " " I know . " " This is not a proposal they are drooling to accept . " " So I have to resolve in my own mind . " " You have to resolve in your own mind who you want to owe this money to . It is not found money . I have structured a deal here that I am not looking to pull in five points a week like the neighborhoodloanshark . We are talking about a forty-thousand-dollar loan . We are speaking in a range of one thousand dollars a week vigorish . " " Which is ninety-two thousand total after one year . " **25;15481;TOOLONG speed was about forty miles an hour .

At his current speed , however , he would arrive at their place at least ten minutes after they had left . His intention had been to delay them at their house until the danger had passed . That plan was no longer viable . The January sky seemed to have sunk so low under the weight of the storm that it was no higher than the tops of the serried ranks of massive evergreens that flanked both sides of the roadway . Wind shook the trees and hammered the Jeep . Snow stuck to the windshield wipers and became ice , so he turned up the defroster and hunched over the wheel , squinting through the inadequately cleaned glass . When he next glanced at his watch , he saw that he had less than fifteen minutes . Laura , Danny , and Chris would be getting into their Chevy Blazer . They might even be pulling out of their driveway already . He would have to intercept them on the highway , scant seconds ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jeep without shooting wide of a turn and into an abyss . Five weeks after the day that Danny bought her the Lalique bowl , on August 15 , 1979 , a few minutes after noon , Laura was in the kitchen , heating a can of chicken soup for lunch , when she got a call from Spencer Keene , her literary agent in New York . Viking loved Shadrach and were offering a hundredthousand . " Dollars ? " she asked . " Of course , dollars , " Spencer said . " What do you think , Russian rubles ? What would that buy you  --  a hat maybe ? " " Oh , God . " She had to lean against the kitchen counter because suddenlyher legs were weak . Spencer said , " Laura , honey , only you can know what 's best for you , but unless they 're willing to let the hundred grand stand for a floor bid in an auction , I want you to consider turning this down . " " Turn down a hundred thousand dollars ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send this out to maybe six or eight houses , set an auction date , see what happens . I think I know what will happen , Laura , I think they 'll all love this book as much as I do . On the other hand . . . maybep101not . It 's a hard decision , and you 've got to go away and think about it before you answer me . The moment Spencer said goodbye and hung up , Laura dialed Danny at work and told him about the offer . He said , " If they wo n't make it a floor bid , turn it down . " " But , Danny , can we afford to ? I mean , my car is eleven years old and falling apart . Yours is almost four years old  --  " " Listen , what did I tell you about this book ? Did n't I tell you that it was you , a reflection of what you are ? " " You 're sweet , but  --  " " Turn it down . Listen , Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like spitting in the faces of all the gods of good fortune ; it 's like inviting that lightning you 've spoken about . But you earned this payoff , and fate is n't going to cheat you out of it . " She called Spencer Keene and told him her decision . Excited , nervous , already missing the hundred thousand dollars , she returned to the den and sat at her typewriter and stared at the unfinished short story for a while until she became aware of the odor of chicken soup and remembered she had left it on the stove . She hurried into the kitchen and found that all but half an inch of soup had boiled away ; burnt noodles were stuck to the bottom of the pot . At two-ten , which was five-ten New York time , Spencer called again to say that Viking had agreed to let the hundred thousand stand as a floor bid . " Now , that 's the very least you make from Shadrach  --  a hundred grand . I think I 'll set September twenty-sixth as the auction date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura . I feel it . " She spent the remainder of the afternoon trying to be elated but unable to shake off her anxiety . Shadrach was already a big success , no matter what happened in the auction . She had no reason for her anxiety , but it held her in a tight grip . Danny came home from work that day with a bottle of champagne , a bouquet of roses , and a box of Godiva chocolates . They sat on the sofa , nibbling chocolates , sipping champagne , and talking about the future , which seemed entirely bright ; yet her anxiety lingered . Finally she said , " I do n't want chocolates or champagne or roses or a hundred thousand dollars . I want you . Take me to bed . " They made love for a long time . The late summer sun ebbed from the windows and the tide of night rolled in before they parted with a sweet , aching reluctance . Lying at her side in the darkness , Danny tenderly kissed her breasts , her throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her anxiety had at last faded . It was not sexual release that expelled her fear . Intimacy , total surrender of self , and the sense of shared hopes and dreamsp102and destinies had been the true medicines ; the great , good feeling of family that she had with him was a talisman that effectively warded off cold fate . On Wednesday , September 26 , Danny took the day off from work to be at Laura 's side as the news came in from New York . At seven-thirty in the morning , ten-thirty New York time , Spencer Keene called to report that Random House had made the first offer above the auction floor . " One hundred and twenty-five thousand , and we 're on our way . Two hours later Spencer called again . " Everyone 's off to lunch , so there 'll be a lull . Right now , we 're up to three hundred and fifty thousand and six houses are still in the bidding . " " Three hundred and fifty thousand ? " Laura repeated . At the kitchen sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plate . When she hung up and looked at Danny , he grinned and said , " Am I mistaken , or is this the book you were afraid might be mule puke ? " Four and a half hours later , as they were sitting at the dinette table pretending to be concentrating on a game of five-hundred rummy , their inattention betrayed by their mutual inability to keep score with any degree of mathematical accuracy whatsoever , Spencer Keene called again . Danny followed her into the kitchen to listen to her side of the conversation . Spencer said , " You sitting down , honey ? " " I 'm ready , Spencer . I do n't need a chair . Tell me . " " It 's over . Simon and Schuster . One million , two hundred and twentyfivethousand dollars . " Weak with shock , shaky , she spoke with Spencer for another ten minutes , and when she hung up , she was n't sure of a thing that had been said after he had told her the price . Danny was staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what had happened . She told him the name of the buyer and the figure . For a moment they stared at each other in silence . Then she said , " I think maybe now we can afford to have a baby . " Stefan topped a hill and peered ahead at the half-mile stretch of snowswept road on which it would happen . ) On his left , beyond the southbound lane , the tree-covered mountainside sloped steeply down to the highway . On his right the northbound lane was edged by a soft shoulder only about four feet wide ,  |p103beyond  which the mountainside fell away again into a deep gorge . No guardrailsprotected travelers from that deadly drop-off . At the bottom of the slope , the road turned left , out of sight . Between that turn below and the crest of the hill , which he had just topped , the twolaneblacktop was deserted . According to his watch , Laura would be dead in a minute . Two minutes at most . He suddenly realized that he should never have tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so late . Instead he should have given up the idea of stopping the Packards and should have tried instead to identify and stop the Robertsons ' vehicle farther back on the road to Arrowhead . That would have worked just as well . Too late now . Stefan had no time to go back , nor could he risk driving farther north toward the Packards . He did not know the exact moment of their deaths , not to the second , but that catastrophe was now approaching swiftly . If he tried to go even another half mile and stop them before they arrived at this fateful incline , he might reach the bottom of the slope and , in taking the turn , pass them going the other way , at which point he would not be able to swing around and catch up with them and stop them before the Robertsons ' truck hit them head-on . He braked gently and angled across the ascending southbound lane , stopping the Jeep on a wide portion of that shoulder of the road about halfway down the slope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the driver 's door . His heart was thudding almost painfully as he shifted the Jeep into park , put on the emergency brake , cut the engine , slid across the seat , and got out the passenger-side door . The blowing snow and icy air stung his face , and all along the mountainsidethe wind shrieked and howled like many voices , perhaps the voices of the three sisters of Greek myth , the Fates , mocking him for his desperate attempt to prevent what they had ordained . After receiving editorial suggestions , Laura undertook an easy revision of Shadrach , delivering the final version of the script in mid-December , 1979 , and Simon and Schuster scheduled the book for publication in September , 1980 . It was such a busy year for Laura and Danny that she was only peripherallyaware of the Iranian hostage crisis and presidential campaign , and even 1 iiore vaguely cognizant of the countless fires , plane crashes , toxic spills , massp104murders , floods , earthquakes , and other tragedies that constituted the news . That was the year the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought their first house  --  a four-bedroom , two-and-a-half-bath , Spanish model in OrangePark Acres  --  and moved out of the apartment in Tustin . She started her third novel , The Golden Edge , and one day when Danny asked her how it was going , she said , " Mule puke , " and he said , " That 's great ! " The first of September , upon receipt of a substantial check for the film rights to Shadrach , which had sold to MGM , Danny quit his job at the brokerage house and became her full-time financial manager . On Sunday , September 21 , three weeks after it arrived in the stores , Shadrach appeared on the New York Times bestseller list at number twelve . On October 5 , 1980 , when Laura gave birth to Christopher Robert Packard , Shadrach was in a third printing , sitting comfortably at number eight on the Times , and received what Spencer Keene called a " thunderously good " review on page five of that same book section . The boy entered the world at 2:23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually carried babies out of their prenatal darkness . Pain-racked and hemorrhaging , Laura required three pints during the afternoon and evening . She spent a better night than expected , however , and by morning she was sore , weary , but well out of danger . The following day during visiting hours , Thelma Ackerson came to see the baby and the new mother . Still dressed punkish and ahead of her time  --  hair long on the left side of her head , with a white streak like the bride of Frankenstein , and short on the right side , with no streak  --  she breezed into Laura 's private room , went straight to Danny , threw her arms around him , hugged him hard , and said , " God , you 're big . You 're a mutant . Admit it , Packard , your mother might have been human , but your father was a grisly bear . " She came to the bed where Laura was propped up against three pillows , kissed her on the forehead and then on the cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a peek at Christopher Robert through the glass , and he 's adorable . But I think you 're going to need all the millions you can make from your books , kiddo , because that boy is going to take after his father , and your food bill 's going to run thirty thousand a month . Until you get him housebroken , he 'll be eating your furniture . " Laura said , " I 'm glad you came , Thelma . " " Would I miss it ? Maybe if I was playing a Mafia-owned club in Bayonne , New Jersey , and had to cancel out part of a date to fly back , maybe then I 'd miss it because if you break a contract with those guys they cut off your thumbs and make you use them as suppositories . But I was west of the Mississippi when I got the news last night , and only nuclear war or a date with Paul McCartney could keep me away . " Almost two years ago Thelma had finally gotten time on the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She landed an agent and began to get paid bookings in sleazy , third-rate  --  and eventually second-rate  --  clubs across the country . Laura and Danny had driven into Los Angeles twice to see her perform , and she had been hilarious ; she wrote her own material and deliveredit with the comic timing she had possessed since childhood but had honed in the intervening years . Her act had one unusual aspect that would either make her a national phenomenon or ensure her obscurity : Woven through the jokes was a strong thread of melancholy , a sense of the tragedy of life that existed simultaneously with the wonder and humor of it . In fact it was similar to the tone of Laura 's novels , but what appealed to book readers was less likely to appeal to audiences who had paid for belly laughs . Now Thelma leaned across the bed railing , peered closely at Laura and said , " Hey , you look pale . And those rings around your eyes . . . " Thelma , dear , I hate to shatter your illusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stork . The mother has to expel it from her own womb , and it 's a tight fit . " Thelma stared hard at her , then directed an equally hard stare at Danny , who had come around the other side of the bed to hold Laura 's hand . " What 's wrong here ? " Laura sighed and , wincing with discomfort , shifted her position slightly . To Danny , she said , " See ? I told you she 's a bloodhound . " " It was n't an easy pregnancy , was it ? " Thelma demanded . " The pregnancy was easy enough , " Laura said . " It was the delivery that was the problem . " " You did n't . . . almost die or anything , Shane ? " " No , no , no , " Laura said , and Danny 's hand tightened on hers . " Nothingthat dramatic . We knew from the start there were going to be some difficulties along the way , but we found the best doctor , and he kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't be able to have any more . Christopher will be our last . " Thelma looked at Danny , at Laura , and said quietly , " I 'm sorry . " " It 's all right , " Laura said , forcing a smile . " We have little Chris , and he 's beautiful . " They endured an awkward silence , and then Danny said , " I have n't had lunch yet , and I 'm starved . I 'm going to slip down to the coffee shop for a half hour or so . " When Danny left , Thelma said , " He 's not really hungry , is he ? He just knew we wanted a girl-to-girl talk . " Laura smiled . " He 's a lovely man . " Thelma put down the railing on one side of the bed and said , " If I hop up here and sit beside you , I wo n't shake up your insides , will I ? You wo n't suddenly bleed all over me , will you , Shane ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thelma eased up onto the high hospital bed . She took one of Laura 's hands in both of hers . " Listen , I read Shadrach , and it 's damned good . It 's what all writers try to do and seldom achieve . " " You 're sweet . " " I 'm a tough , cynical , hard-nosed broad . Listen , I 'm serious about the book . It 's brilliant . And I saw Bovine Bowmaine in there , and Tammy . And Boone , the child-welfare psychologist . Different names but I saw them . You 've captured them perfectly , Shane . God , there were times you brought it all back , times when chills ran up and down my back so bad I had to put down the book and go for a walk in the sun . And there were times when I laughed like a loon . " Laura ached in every muscle , in every joint . She did not have the strength to lean away from the pillows and put her arms around her friend . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Eel was n't there , of course . " " I 'm saving him for another book . " " And me , damn it . I 'm not in the book , though I 'm the most colorful character you 've ever known ! " " I 'm saving you for a book all your own , " Laura said . " You mean it , do n't you ? " " Yes . Not the one I 'm working on now but the one after it . " " Listen , Shane , you better make me gorgeous , or I 'll sue your ass off . You hear me ? " " I hear you . " Thelma chewed her lip , then said , " Will you  --  " " Yes . I 'm going to put Ruthie in it too . " They were silent a while , just holding hands . Unshed tears clouded Laura 's vision , but she saw that Thelma was blinkingback tears too . " Do n't . It 'll streak all that elaborate punk eye makeup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these boots freaky or what ? Black leather , pointy toes , stud-ringed heels . Makes me look like a damned dominatrix , does n't it ? " " When you walked in , the first thing I wondered was how many men you 've whipped lately . " Thelma sighed and sniffed hard to clear her nose . " Shane , listen and listen good . This talent of yours is maybe more precious than you think . You 're able to capture people 's lives on the page , and when the people are gone , the page is still there , the life is still there . You can put feelings on the page , and anyone , anywhere , can pick up that book and feel those same feelings , you can touch the heart , you can remind us what it means to be human in a world that 's increasingly bent on forgetting . That 's a talent and ap107reason to live that 's more than most people ever have . So . . . well , I know how much you want to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've said . . so I know how bad you must be hurting right now . But you 've got Danny and Christopher and this amazing talent , and that 's so very much to have . " Laura 's voice was unsteady . " Sometimes . . . I 'm just so afraid . " " Afraid of what , baby ? " " I wanted a big family because . . . then it 's less likely they 'll all be taken away from me . " " Nobody 's going to be taken away from you . " " With just Danny and little Chris . . . just two of them . . . somethingmight happen . " " Nothing will happen . " " Then I 'd be alone . " " Nothing will happen , " Thelma repeated . " Something always seems to happen . That 's life . " Thelma slid farther onto the bed , stretched out beside Laura , and put her head against Laura 's shoulder . " When you said it was a hard birth . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was scared . I have friends in LA , sure , but all of them are show-biz types . You 're the only real person I 'm close to , even though we do n't see each other that much , and the idea that you might have nearly . . . " " But I did n't . " " Might 've , though . " Thelma laughed sourly . " Hell , Shane , once an orphan , always an orphan , huh ? " Laura held her and stroked her hair . Shortly after Chris 's first birthday , Laura delivered The Golden Edge . It was published ten months later , and by the boy 's second birthday , the book was number one on the Times bestseller list , which was a first for her . Danny managed Laura 's book income with such diligence , caution , and brilliance that within a few years , in spite of the savage bite of income taxes , they would be not just rich  --  they were already rich by most standards  --  but seriously rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had never expected to be rich . When she considered her enviable circumstances , she thought perhaps she should be thrilled or , given the want of much of the world , appalled , but she felt nothing much one way or the other about the money . The security that money provided was welcome ; it inspired confidence . But they had no plans to move out of their quite pleasant fourbedroomhouse , though they could have afforded an estate . The money was-atp108there , and that was the end of it ; she gave it little thought . Life was not money ; life was Danny and Chris and , to a lesser extent , her books . With a toddler in the house , she no longer had the ability or desire to work sixty hours a week at her word processor . Chris was talking , walking , and he exhibited none of the moodiness or mindless rebellion that the childrearingbooks described as normal behavior for the year between two and three . Mostly he was a pleasure to be with , a bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she could without risk of spoiling him . The Amazing Appleby Twins , her fourth novel , was not published until October , 1984 , two years after The Golden Edge , but there was none of the drop-off in audience that is sometimes the case when a writer does not publish a book each year . The advance sales were her biggest yet . On October first , she was sitting with Danny and Chris on the sofa in the family room , watching old Road Runner cartoons on the VCR  --  " V000m , v000m ! " Christopher said each time Road Runner took off in a flash of speed  --  eating popcorn , when Thelma called from Chicago , in tears . Laura took the call on the kitchen phone , but on the TV in the adjoining room the beleaguered coyote was trying to blow up his nemesis and was blowing himself up instead , so Laura said , " Danny , I better take this in the den . " In the four years since Chris was born , Thelma 's career had gone straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegas casino lounges . ( " Hey , Shane , I must be pretty good because the cocktail waitresses are nearly naked , all boobs and butts , and sometimes the guys in the audience actually look at me instead of them . On the other hand maybe I only appeal to fags . " ) In the past year she had moved into the main showroom at the MGM Grand as an opening act for Dean Martin , and she had made four appearances on the Tonight show with Johnny Carson . There was talk of a movie or even a television series to be built around her , and she seemed poised for stardom as a comedienne . Now she was in Chicago , opening soon as the headliner at a major club . Perhaps the long chain of positive developments in their lives was what panicked Laura when she heard Thelma crying . For some time she had been waiting for the sky to fall with a horrid suddenness that would have caught Chicken Little unaware . She dropped into the chair behind the desk in the den @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , what 's wrong ? " " I just read . . . the new book . " Laura could not figure what in The Amazing Appleby Twins could have affected Thelma so profoundly , and then she suddenly wondered if something in the characterization of Carrie and Sandra Appleby had offended . Though none of the major events in the story mirrored those in the lives of Ruthie and Thelma , the Applebys were , of course , based on the Ackersons.  |p109But  both characters had been drawn with great love and good humor ; surely t here was nothing about them that would offend Thelma , and in panic Laura tried to say as much . " No , no , Shane , you hopeless fool , " Thelma said between bouts of tears . " I 'm not offended . The reason I ca n't stop crying is because you did the most wonderful thing . Carrie Appleby is Ruthie as sure as I ever knew her , but in your book you let Ruthie live a long time . You let Ruthie live , Shane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job than God did in real life . " They talked for an hour , mostly about Ruthie , reminiscing , not with a lot of tears , now , but mostly with affection . Danny and Chris appeared in the open doorway of the den a couple of times , looking abandoned , and Laura blew them kisses , but she stayed on the telephone with Thelma because it was one of those rare times when remembering the dead was more important than tending to the needs of the living . Two weeks before Christmas , 1985 , when Chris was five and then some , the southern California rainy season started with a downpour that made palm fronds rattle like bones , battered the last remaining blossoms off the impatiens , and flooded streets . Chris could not play outside . His father was off inspecting a potential real estate investment , and the boy was in no mood to entertain himself . He kept finding excuses to bother Laura in her office , and by eleven o'clock she gave up trying to work on the current book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets out of the cupboard , promising to let him help her make chocolate-chip cookies . Before joining him , she got Sir Tommy Toad 's webbed-foot boots , tiny umbrella , and miniature scarf from the dresser drawer in the bedroom , where she had been keeping them for just such a day as this . On her way to the kitchen she arranged those items near the front door . Later , as she was slipping a tray of cookies into the oven , she sent him to the front door to see if the United Parcel deliveryman had left a package that she professed to be expecting , and Chris came back flushed with excitement . " Mommy , come look , come see . " In the foyer he showed her the three miniature items , and she said , " I suppose they belong to Sir Tommy . Oh , did I forget to tell you about the lodger we 've taken in ? A fine , upstanding toad from England here on the queen 's business . " She had been eight when her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabulous toad as a fun fantasy , but Chris was only five and took it more seriously . " Where 's he going to sleep  --  the spare bedroom ? Then what do we do when Grandpa comes to visit ? " " We 've rented Sir Tommy a room in the attic , " Laura said , " and wep110must not disturb him or tell anyone about him except Daddy because Sir Tommy is here on secret business for Her Majesty . " He looked at her wide-eyed , and she wanted to laugh but dared not . He had brown hair and eyes , like she and Danny , but his features were delicate , more his mother 's than his father 's . In spite of his smallness there was something about him that made her think he would eventually shoot up to be tall and solidly constructed like Danny . He leaned close and whispered : " Is Sir Tommy a spy ? " Throughout the afternoon , as they baked cookies , cleaned up , and played a few games of Old Maids , Chris was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for children was in some ways more demanding than writing novels for adults . When Danny came home at four-thirty , he shouted a greeting on his way along the hall from the connecting door to the garage . Chris jumped up from the breakfast-nook table , where he and Laura were playing cards , and urgently shushed his father . " Sssshhh , Daddy , Sir Tommy might be sleeping now , he had a long trip , he 's the Queen of England , and he 's spying in our attic ! " Danny frowned . " I go away from home for just a few hours , and while I 'm gone we 're invaded by scaly , transvestite , British spies ? " That night in bed , after Laura made love with a special passion that surprised even her , Danny said , " What 's gotten into you today ? All evening you were so . . . buoyant , so up . " Snuggling against him under the covers , enjoying the feel of his nude body against hers , she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm alive , and Chris is alive , you 're alive , we 're all together . And it 's this Tommy Toad thing . " " It tickles you ? " " Tickles me , yes . But it 's more than that . It 's . . . well , somehow it makes me feel that life goes on , that it always goes on , the cycle is renewed  --  does this sound crazy ?  --  and that life is going to go on for us , too , for all of us , for a long time . " " Well , yeah , I think you 're right , " he said . " Unless you 're that energetic every time you make love from now on , in which case you 'll kill me in about three months . " In October , 1986 , when Chris turned six , Laura 's fifth novel , Endless River , was published to critical acclaim and bigger sales than any of her previous titles . Her editor had predicted the greater success : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the tragedy , that whole weird mix of a Laura Shanep111novel , but it 's somehow not as dark as the others , and that makes it especially appealing . " For two years , Laura and Danny had been taking Chris up to the San Bernardino Mountains at least one weekend a month , to Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear , both during the summer and winter , to make sure he learned that the whole world was not like the pleasant but thoroughly urbanized and suburbanized realms of Orange County . With the continued flowering of her career and the success of Danny 's investment strategies , and considering her recent willingness not only to entertain optimism but to live it , they decided it was time to indulge themselves , so they bought a second home in the mountains . It was an eleven-room stone and redwood place on thirty acres just off state route 330 , a few miles south of Big Bear . It was , in fact , a more expensive house than the one they lived in during the week in Orange Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ponderosa pine , and sugar pine , and their nearest neighbor was far beyond sight . During their first weekend at the retreat , as they were making a snowman , three deer appeared at the edge of the looming forest , twenty yards away , and watched curiously . Chris was thrilled at the sight of the deer , and by the time he had been tucked in bed that night , he was sure that they were Santa Claus 's deer . This was where the jolly fat man went after Christmas , he insisted , and not , as legend had it , to the North Pole . Wind and Stars appeared in October of ' 87 , and it was a still bigger hit than any of her previous books . The movie of Endless River was released that Thanksgiving , enjoying the biggest opening-week box office of any film that year . On Friday , January 8 , 1988 , buoyed by the knowledge that Wind and Stars would hold the number one spot on the Times list that Sunday for the fifth week in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon , as soon as Chris came home from school . The following Tuesday was Laura 's thirtythirdbirthday , and they intended to have an early celebration , just the three of them , high in the mountains , with the snow like icing on a cake and the wind to sing for her . Accustomed to them , the deer ventured within twenty feet of their house on Saturday morning . But Chris was seven now , and in school he heard the rumor that Santa Claus was not real , and he was no longer so sure that these were more than ordinary deer . The weekend was perfect , perhaps the best they had spent in the mountains , but they had to cut it short . They had intended to leave at six o'clock Monday morning , returning to Orange County in time to deliver Chris to school . However a major storm moved into the area ahead of schedule latep112Sunday afternoon , and though they were little more than ninety minutes from the balmy temperatures nearer the coast , the weather report called for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk being snowbound and causing Chris to miss a day of school  --  a possibility even with their fourwheel-driveBlazer  --  they closed up the big stone and redwood house and headed south on state route 330 at a few minutes past four o'clock . Southern California was one of the few places in the world where you could drive from a winterscape to subtropical heat in less than two hours , and Laura always enjoyed  --  and marveled at  --  the journey . The three of them were dressed for snow  --  wool socks , boots , thermal underwear , heavy slacks , warm sweaters , ski jackets  --  but in an hour and a quarter they would be in milder climes where no one was bundled up , and in two hours they would be in shirtsleeve weather . Laura drove while Danny , sitting in front , and Chris , sitting behind him , played a word-association game that they had devised on previous trips to amuse themselves . Rapidly falling snow found even those sections of the highway that were largely protected by trees on both sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millions in the capricious currents of the high-mountain winds , sometimes half obscuringthe way ahead . She drove with caution , not caring if the two-hour drive home required three hours or four ; since they had left early , they had plenty of time to spare , all the time in the world . When she came out of the big curve a few miles south of their house and entered the half-mile incline , she saw a red Jeep station wagon parked on the right shoulder and a man in a navy peacoat in the middle of the road . He was coming down the hill , waving both arms to halt them . Leaning forward and squinting between the thumping windshield wipers , Danny said , " Looks like he broke down , needs help . " " Packard 's Patrol to the rescue ! " Chris said from the back seat . As Laura slowed , the guy on the road began frantically gesturing for them to pull to the right shoulder . Danny said uneasily , " Something odd about him . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardian . The sight of him after all these years shocked and frightened Laura . He had just gotten out of the stolen Jeep when the Blazer turned the bend at the bottom of the hill . As he rushed toward it , he saw Laura slow the Blazer to a crawl a third of the way up the slope , but she was still in the middle of the roadway , so he signaled her more frantically to get off onto the shoulder ,  |p113as  close to the embankment as possible . At first she continued to creep forward , - as if unsure whether he was only a motorist in trouble or dangerous , but when they drew close enough to each other for her to see his face and perhaps recognize him , she immediately obeyed . As she accelerated past him and whipped the Blazer onto the wider portion of the shoulder , only twenty feet downhill from Stefan 's Jeep , he reversed direction and ran to her , yanked open her door . " I do n't know if being off the road 's good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow ! " Danny said , " Hey , wait just  --  " " Do what he says ! " Laura shouted . " Chris , come on , get out ! " Stefan gripped Laura 's hand and helped her out of the driver 's seat . As Danny and Chris also scrambled from the Blazer , Stefan heard a laboring engine above the skirling wind . He looked up the long hill and saw that a big pickup truck had topped the crest and was starting down toward them . Pulling Laura after him , he ran around the front of the Blazer . Her guardian said , " Up the embankment , come on , " and began to climb the hard-packed , ice-crusted snow that had been shoved there by plows and that sloped steeply toward the nearby trees . Laura looked up the highway and saw the truck , a quarter-mile from them and only a hundred feet below the crest , beginning a long , sickening slide on the treacherous pavement until it was coming sideways down the road . If they had not stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been just below the crest when the truck went out of control ; already they would have been hit . Beside her , with Chris riding him piggyback and holding on tight , Danny obviously had seen the danger . The truck might come all the way down the hill without the driver in control , might slam into the Jeep and Blazer . Lugging Chris , he scrambled up the snow-packed embankment , yellingfor Laura to move . She climbed , grabbing for handholds , kicking footholds as she went . The snow was not only ice-mantled but ice-marbled and rotten in places , break ; ng away in chunks , and a couple of times she nearly fell backward to the shoulder of the highway below . By the time she joined ( her guardian , Danny , and Chris fifteen feet above the highway , on a narrow but snow-free shelf of rock near the trees , it seemed as if she had been climbing for minutes . But in fact her sense of time must have been distorted by fear , for when she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding toward them , that it was two hundred feet away , had made one complete revolution , and was turning sideways again.  |p114On  it came through the streaming snow , as if in slow motion , fate in the form of a few tons of steel . A snowmobile stood in the big pickup 's cargo bed , and it was apparently not secured by chains or in any way restrained ; the driver foolishly had relied on inertia to keep it in place . But now the snowmobilewas slamming from side to side against the walls of the cargo hold and forward into the bark wall of the cab , and through the quarter-mile slide its violent shifts ! contributed ; to the destabilization of the vehicle under it , until it seemed as if the truck , leaning radically , would roll instead of spin through another complete turn . Laura saw the driver fighting the wheel , and she saw a woman beside him , screaming , and she thought : Oh , my god , those poor people ! As if sensing her thoughts , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of them , and no snow chains . " If you know that much about them , she thought , you must know who they are , so why did n't you stop them , why did n't you save them too ? With a terrible crash the front end of the truck rammed into the side of the Jeep , and unrestrained by a seat belt , the woman was thrown halfway through the windshield , where she hung partly in and partly out of the cabLaura yelled , " Chris ! " But she saw that Danny had already taken the boy off his back and was holding him close , turning his head away from the ongoing accident.  --  the collision did n't stop the truck ; it had too much momentum , and the pavement was too slippery for chainless tread to grip . But the brutal impact did reverse the direction of the truck 's slide : it abruptly whipped around to its driver 's right , heading backward down the hill , and the snowmobileexploded through the tailgate , flew free , crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windshield . An instant later the rear of the pickup slammed into the front of the Blazer with enough force to shove that vehicle ten feet backward in spite of its firmly engaged emergency brakesThough viewing the destruction from the safety of the embankment , Laura gripped Danny 's arm , horrified by the thought that they surely would have been injured and perhaps killed if they had taken refuge either in front of or behind the Blazer.  --  now the pickup bounced off the Blazer ; the bloodied woman fell back into the cab ; and , sliding more slowly but still out of control , the battered truck turned three hundred and sixty degrees in an eerily graceful ballet of death , angling down the slope and across the snowy pavement and over the far shoulder , over the unguarded brink , out into emptiness , down , out of sight , gone . Though no horror remained to be seen , Laura covered her face with her hands , perhaps trying to block out the mental image of the pickup carrying its occupants down the rocky , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . The driver and his companion would be dead before they hit bottom . Even above the raging wind , she heard the truck strike an outcropping of rock , then another . But in seconds the noise of its violent descent faded , and the only sound was the mad shrieking of the storm . Stunned , they slid and groped their way down the embankment to the shoulder of the road between the Jeep and the Blazer , where bits of glass and mental littered the snowy surface . Steam rose from under the Blazer as hot radiator fluid drizzled onto the frozen ground , and the ruined vehicle creaked under the weight of the snowmobile embedded in its hood . Chris was crying . Laura reached for him . He came into her arms , and she lifted him , held him , while he sobbed against her neck . Dazed , Danny turned to their savior . " Who . . . who in the name of God are you ? " Laura stared at her guardian , finding it difficult to cope with the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in over twenty years , since she was twelve , that day in the cemetery when she had spotted him watching her father 's interment from the grove of Indian laurels. ; " She had not seen him close up for almost twenty-five years , since the day he had killed the junkie in her father 's grocery . When he failed to save her from the Eel , when he left her to handle that one on her own , a loss of faith set in , and doubt was encouraged when he did nothing to save Nina Dockweiler , either  --  or Ruthie . With the passage of so much time , he had become a dream figure , more myth than reality , and in the last couple of years she had not thought about him at all , had abandoned belief in him just as Chris was currently abandoning belief in Santa Claus . She still had the note that he 'd left on her desk , after her father 's funeral . But she had long ago convinced herself that it had not in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Tom Lance , her father 's friends . Now he had saved her again , miraculously , and Danny wanted to know who in the name of God he was , and that was what Laura wanted to know as well . The strangest part of it was that he looked the same as when he had shot the junkie . Exactly the same . She had recognized him at once , even after the passage of so much time , because he had not aged . He still appeared to he in his middle to late thirties . Impossibly , the years had left no mark on him , no hint of gray in his blond hair , no wrinkles in his face . Though he had been her father 's age that bloody day in the grocery store , he now was of her own generation or nearly so . Before the man could answer Danny 's question or find a way to avoid an answer , a car topped the hill and started down toward them . It was a latemodelPontiac equipped with tire chains that sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Jeep and the Blazer and noted thep116pickup 's still fresh skid marks that had not yet been obliterated by wind and snow ; he slowed  --  with reduced speed the song of the chains quickly changed to a clatter  --  and pulled across the pavement into the southbound lane . Insteadof going all the way to the shoulder and out of traffic , however , the car continued north in the wrong lane , stopping only fifteen feet from them , near the back of the Jeep . When he threw open the door and got out of the Pontiac , the driver  --  a tall man in dark clothing  --  was holding an object that , too late , Laura identified as a submachine gun . Her guardian said , " Kokoschka ! " Even as his name was spoken , Kokoschka opened fire . Though he was more than fifteen years from Vietnam , Danny reacted with the instincts of a soldier . As bullets ricocheted off the red Jeep in front of them and off the Blazer behind them , Danny grabbed Laura , pushing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Laura dropped below the line of fire , she saw Danny struck in the back . He was hit at least once , maybe twice , and she jerked as if the slugs had hit her . He fell against the front of the Blazer , dropped to his knees . Laura cried out and , holding Chris with one arm , reached for her husband . He was still alive , and in fact he swung toward her on his knees . His face was as white as the snow falling around them , and she had the bizarre and terrible feeling that she was looking into the countenance of a ghost rather than that of a living man . " Get under the Jeep , " Danny said , pushing her hand away . His voice was thick and wet , as if something had broken in his throat . " Quick ! " One of the bullets had passed completely through him . Bright blood oozed down the front of his blue , quilted ski jacket . When she hesitated , he moved to her on hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few feet away . Another loud burst of submachine-gun fire crackled through the wintry air . The gunman would no doubt move cautiously forward toward the front of the Jeep and slaughter them as they cowered there . Yet they had nowhere to run : If they went up the embankment toward the trees , he would cut them down long before they reached the safety of the forest ; if they crossed the road , he would blow them away before they reached the other side , and at the other side there was nothing but the steep-walled gorge , anyway ; running uphill , they would be heading toward him ; running downhill , they would be putting their backs to him , making even easier targets of themselves . The submachine gun rattled . Windows burst . Bullets punctured sheet metal with a hard pock-twang . Crawling to the front of the Jeep , dragging Chris with her , Laura sawp117her guardian slipping into the narrow space between that vehicle and the snow-packed embankment . He was crouched below the fender , out of sight of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer seemed magical , no guardian angel but merely a man ; and in fact he was no longer a savior , either , but an agent of Death , for his presence here had attracted the killer . At Danny 's urging she frantically squirmed under the Jeep . Chris squirmed , too , not crying now , being brave for his father ; but then he had not seen his father shot , for his face had been pressed to Laura 's breast , buried in her ski jacket . It seemed useless to get under the Jeep because Kokoschka would find them anyway . He could not be so dim-witted as to fail to look under the Jeep when they could be found nowhere else , so at most they were just buying a little time , an extra minute of life at most . When she was completely under the Jeep , pulling Chris against her to give him what little additional protection her body could provide , she heard Danny speak to her from the front of the vehicle . " I love you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words also meant goodbye . Stefan slipped between the Jeep and the dirty , mounded snow along the embankment . There was little space , not enough for him to have gotten out of the driver 's door on that side when he had parked there , but barely enough to squeeze along toward the rear bumper where Kokoschka might not expect him to show up , where he might get off one good shot before Kokoschka swung around and sprayed him with the submachine gun . Kokoschka . He had never been so surprised in his life as when Kokoschka had gotten out of that Pontiac . It meant they were aware of his traitorous activities at the institute . And they were also aware that he had interposed himself between Laura and her true destiny . Kokoschka had taken the Lightning Road with the intention of eliminating the traitor and evidentlyLaura as well . Now , keeping his head down , Stefan urgently forced his way between the Jeep and the embankment . The submachine gun chattered and windows blew out above him . At his back the snowbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when he endured the pain and pressed hard with his body , the ice cracked , and the snow beneath it compacted just enough to give him passage . Wind streamed through the narrow space he occupied , shrieking between sheet metal and snow , so it seemed that he was not alone there but was in the company of some invisible creature that hooted and gibbered in his face . He had seen Laura and Chris wriggling under the Jeep , but he knew that cover would provide only an additional minute of safety , perhaps evenp118less . When Kokoschka got to the front of the Jeep and did n't find them there , he would look under the vehicle , get down at road level , and open fire , chopping them to pieces in their confinement . And what of Danny ? He was such a big man , barrel-chested , surely too big to slide swiftly under the Jeep . And already he 'd been shot ; he must be stiff with pain . Besides , Danny was n't the kind of man who hid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stefan reached the rear bumper . Cautiously he looked out and saw the Pontiac parked eight feet away in the southbound lane with its driver 's door standing open , engine running . No Kokoschka . So with his Walther PPK/S .380 in hand he eased away from the snowbank , moved behind the Jeep . He crouched against the tailgate and peered around the other rear bumper . Kokoschka was in the middle of the roadway , moving toward the front of the Jeep where he believed everyone had taken cover . ' His weapon was an Uzi with an extended magazine , chosen for the mission because it would not be anachronistic . As Kokoschka reached the gap between the Jeep and the Blazqr , he opened fire again , sweeping the submachine gun from left to right . Bullets screamed off metal , blew out tires , and thudded into the embankment . Stefan fired at Kokoschka , missed . Suddenly , with berserk courage , Danny Packard launched himself at Kokoschka , coming out from his hiding place tight up against the Jeep 's grille , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to have been under the spray of bullets the submachine gun had just laid down . He was wounded from the initial burst of fire but still quick and powerful , and for a moment it seemed that he might even reach the gunman and disable him . Kokoschka was sweeping the Uzi from left to right , already moving away from his target when he saw Danny coming at him , so he had to reverse himself , bring the muzzle around . If he had been a few feet closer to the Jeep instead of in the middle of the highway , he would not have nailed Danny in time . " Danny , no ! " Stefan shouted , squeezing off three shots at Kokoschka even as Packard was going for him . But Kokoschka had kept a cautious distance , and he brought the spitting muzzle around , straight at Danny , when they were still three or four feet apart . Danny was kicked backward by the impact of several slugs . Stefan took no consolation from the fact that even as Danny was hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Walther , one in his left thigh and one in his left shoulder . He was knocked down . He dropped the submachine gun as he fell ; it spun along the pavement . Under the Jeep , Laura was screaming.  |p119Stefan  rose from the cover of the rear bumper and ran toward Kokoschka , who was on the ground only thirty feet downslope , near the Blazer now . He slipped on the snowy pavement , struggled to keep his balance . Badly wounded , no doubt in shock , Kokoschka nevertheless saw him coming . He rolled toward the Uzi carbine , which had come to rest by the rear tire of the Blazer . Stefan fired three times as he ran , but he did not have the steadiness required for a good aim , and Kokoschka was rolling away from him , so he missed the son of a bitch . Then Stefan slipped again and fell to one knee in the middle of the road , landing so hard that pain shot up his thigh and into his hip . Rolling , Kokoschka reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man in time , Stefan dropped onto both knees and raised the Walther , holding it with both hands . He was twenty feet from Kokoschka , not far . But even a good marksman could miss at twenty feet if the circumstances were bad enough , and these were bad : a state of panic , a weird firing angle , gale-force wind to deflect the shot . Downslope , lying on the ground , Kokoschka opened fire the instant he got his hands on the Uzi , even before he brought the weapon around , loosing the first twenty rounds under the Blazer , blowing out the front tires . As Kokoschka swung the gun toward him , Stefan squeezed off his last three rounds with deliberation . In spite of the wind and the angle , he had to make them count , for if he missed he would have no time to reload . The first round from the Walther missed . Kokoschka continued to bring the submachine gun around , and the arc of fire reached the front of the Jeep . Laura was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground level , so surely a couple of rounds had passed under the vehicle . Stefan fired again . The slug hit Kokoschka in the upper body , and the submachine gun stopped firing . Stefan 's next and last shot took Kokoschka in the head . It was over . From beneath the Jeep , Laura saw Danny 's incredibly brave charge , saw him go down again , flat on his back , unmoving , and she knew that he was dead , no possibility of a reprieve this time . A flash of grief like the terrible light from an explosion swept through her , and she glimpsed a future without Danny , a vision so starkly illuminated and of such dreadful power that she almost blacked out . Then she thought of Chris , still alive and sheltering against her . She blocked out the grief , knowing she would return to it later  --  if she survived.  |p120The  important thing ; right , now was keeping Chris alive and , if possible , protecting him from the sight of his father 's bullet-riddled corpse . Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Kokoschka hit by gunfire . She saw her guardian approaching the downed gunman , and for a moment it seemed the worst was over . Then her guardian slipped and fell to one knee , and Kokoschka rolled toward the submachine gun , that he had dropped . More gunfire . A lot of it in a few seconds . She heard a couple of rounds passing under the Jeep , frighteningly close , lead cutting through the air with a deadly whisper that was louder than any other sound in the world . The silence after the gunfire was at first perfect . Initially she could not hear the wind or her son 's low sobbing . Gradually those sounds impinged upon her . She saw her guardian was alive , and part of her was relieved , but part of her was irrationally angry that he had survived because he had drawn this Kokoschka with him , and Kokoschka had killed Danny . On the other hand Danny  --  and she and Chris  --  would surely have been killed in the collision with the truck , anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell was he ? Where did he come from ? Why was he so interested in her ? She was frightened , angry , shocked , sick in her soul , and badly confused . Clearly in pain , her guardian rose from his knees and hobbled to Kokoschka . Laura twisted farther around to look directly down the hill , just past Danny 's unmoving head . She could not quite see what her guardian was doing , though he appeared to be tearing open Kokoschka 's clothes . After a while he hobbled back up the hill , carrying something he had taken off the corpse . When he reached the Jeep , he crouched and looked under at her . " Come out . It 's over . " His face was pale , and in the past few minutes he seemed to have aged at least a couple of his twentyrfive lost years . He cleared his throat . In a voice filled with what seemed like genuine , deeply felt remorse , he said , " I 'm sorry , Laura . I 'm so very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of the Jeep , bumping her head on the undercarriage . She pulled Chris and encouraged him to come with her , for if they wriggled out nearer the front , the boy might see his father . Her guardian pulled them into the open . Laura sat back against the rear bumper and clutched Chris to her . Tremulously , the boy said , " I want Daddy . " I want him too , Laura thought . Oh , baby , I want him , too , I want him so bad , all I want in the world is your daddy . The storm was a full-fledged blizzard now , pumping snow out of the sky under tremendous pressure . The afternoon was dying ; light was fading , andp121all around the grim , gray day was succumbing to the queer , phosphorescent darkness of a snowy night . In this weather few people would be traveling , but he was sure that someone would come along soon . No more than ten minutes had passed since he had stopped Laura in the Blazer , but even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in traffic would not last much longer . He needed to have a talk with her and leave before he got entangled in the aftermath of this bloody encounter . Hunkering down in front of her and the weeping boy , behind the Jeep , Stefan said , " Laura , I 've got to get out of here , but I 'll be back soon , in just a couple of days  --  " " Who are you ? " she demanded angrily . " There 's no time for that now . " " I want to know , damn you . I have a right to know . " " Yes , you do , and I 'll tell you in a few days . But right now we have to get your story straight , the way we did that day in the grocery store . Remem-her ? " " To hell with you . " Unfazed , he said , " It 's for your own good , Laura . You ca n't tell the authorities the exact truth because it wo n't seem real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all up . Especially when you see me leave . . . well , if you tell them how I went , they 'll either be sure that you 're somehow an accompliceto murder or a madwoman . " She glared at him and said nothing . He did not blame her for being angry . Perhaps she even wanted him dead , but he understood that too . The only emotions she stirred in him , however , were love and pity and a profound respect . He said , " You 'll tell them that when you and Danny turned the curve at the bottom of the hill and started up , there were three cars in the roadway : the Jeep parked here along the embankment , the Pontiac in the wrong lane just where it is now , and another car was stopped in the northbound lane . There were . . . four men , two of them with guns , and they seemed to have forced the Jeep off the road . You just came along at the wrong time , that 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull off the road , made you and Danny and Chris get out of the car . At one point you heard talk about cocaine . . . somehow it involved drugs , you do n't know how , but they were arguing over drugs , and they seemed to have chased down the man in the Jeep  --  " " Drug dealers out here in the middle of nowhere ? " she said scornfully . " There could be processing labs out here  --  a cabin in the woods , processingPCP maybe . Listen , if the story makes at least some sense , they'llwant to buy it . The real story makes no sense at all , so you ca n't rely on it . Sop122you tell them the Robertsons came over the crest of the hill in their pickup  --  of course you do n't know their name  --  and the road was blocked by all these cars , and when he braked the pickup it started to slide- " " You 've got an accent , " she said angrily . " A slight one but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll tell you all of that in a few days , " he said impatiently , looking up and down the snow-blasted road . " I really will , but now you 've got to promise me you 'll work with this false story , embellish it as best you can , and not tell them the truth . " " I do n't have any choice , do I ? " " No , " he said , relieved that she realized her position . She clung to her son and said nothing . Stefan had begun to feel the pain in his half-frozen feet again . The heat of action had dissipated , leaving him racked by shivers .. He handed her the belt that he had ' , taken off Kokoschka . " Put this inside your ski jacket . Do n't let anyone see it . When you get home , put it away somewhere . " " What is it ? " " Later . I 'll try to return in a few hours . Only a few hours . Right now just promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious , do n't put it on , and for God 's sake do n't push the yellow button on it . " " Why not ? " " Because you do n't want to go where it 'll take you . " She blinked at him in confusion . " Take me ? " " I 'll explain but not now . " " Why ca n't you take it with you , whatever it is ? " " Two belts , one body  --  it 's an anomaly , it 'll cause a disruption of some kind in the energy field , and God only knows where I might wind up or in what condition . " " I do n't understand . What 're you talking about ? " " Later . But , Laura , if for some reason I 'm unable to come back , you better take precautions . " What kind of precautions ? " " Arm yourself . Be prepared . There 's no reason they should come after you if they get me , but they might . Just to teach me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengeance . And if they come for you . . . there 'll be a squad of them , well armed . " " Who the hell are they ? " Without answering , he got to his feet , wincing at the pain in his right knee . He backed away , taking one last , long look at her . Then he turned , leaving her on the ground , in the cold and snow , against the back of the battered and bullet-pocked Jeep , with her terrified child and her dead husband.  |p123Slowly  he walked out into the middle of the highway where more light seemed to come from the shifting snow on the pavement than from the sky overhead . She called to him , but he ignored her . He holstered his empty gun beneath his coat . He reached inside his shirt , felt for and located the yellow button on his own travel belt , and hesitated . They had sent Kokoschka to stop him . Now they would be waiting anxiously at the institute to learn the outcome . He would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to take the LightningRoad to return to her as he had promised . The temptation to stay was great . If he stayed , however , they would only send someone else to kill him , and he would spend the rest of his life running from one assassin after another  --  while watching the world around him change in ways that would he too horrible to endure . On the other hand , if he went back , there was a slim chance that he might still be able to destroy the institute . Dr. Penlovski and ) the others obviously knew everything about his meddling in the natural flow of events in this one woman 's life , but perhaps they did not know that he had planted explosives in the attic and basement of the institute . In that case , if they gave him an opportunity to get into his office for just a moment , he could throw the hidden switch and blow the place  --  and all its files  --  to hell where it belonged . More likely than not , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as there was any possibility whatsoeverthat he could bring an end forever to the project and close the Lightning Road , he was morally obliged to return to the institute , even if it meant that he would never see Laura again . As the day died , the storm seemed to come more fiercely alive . On the mountainside above the highway , the wind rumbled and keened through the enormous pines , and the boughs made an ominous rustling sound , as if some many-legged , giant creature were scuttling down the slope . The snowflakes had become fine and dry , almost like bits of ice , and they seemed to be abrading the world , smoothing it the way that sandpaper smoothed wood , until eventually there would be no peaks and valleys , nothing but a featureless , highly polished plain as far as anyone could see . With his hand still inside his coat and shirt , Stefan pressed the yellow button three times in quick succession , triggering the beacon . With regret and fear he returned to his own time . Holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground at the back of the Jeep and watched her guardian walk into the slanting snow , past the rear of Kokoschka 's Pontiac.  |p124He  stopped in the middle of the highway , stood for a long moment with his back to her , and then an incredible thing happened . First the air became heavy ; she was aware of a strange pressure , something she had never felt before , as if the atmosphere of the earth were being condensed in some cosmic cataclysm , and abruptly she found it hard to draw breath . The air acquired a curious odor , too , exotic but familiar , and after a few seconds she realized it smelled like hot electrical wires and scorched insulation , much like what she had smelled in her own kitchen when a toaster plug had shorted out a few weeks ago ; that stink was overlaid with the crisp but not unpleasant scent of ozone , which was the same odor that filled the air during any violent thunderstorm . The pressure grew greater , until she almost felt pinned to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were water . With a sound like an enormous cork popping out of a bottle , her guardian vanished from the purple-gray , winter twilight , and simultaneously with that pop came a great whoosh of wind , as if massive quantities of air were rushing in to fill some void . Indeed for an instant she felt trapped in a vacuum , unable to breathe . Then the crushing pressure was gone , the air smelled only of snow and pine , and everything was normal again . Except , of course , after what she had seen , nothing could ever be normalfor her again . The night grew very dark . Without Danny it was the blackest night of her life . Only one light remained to illuminate her struggle toward some distant hope of happiness : Chris . He was the last light in her darkness . Later , at the top of the hill , a car appeared . Headlights bored through the gloom and the heavily falling snow . She struggled to her feet and took Chris into the middle of the roadway . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suddenly wondered if when it stopped another man with another submachine gun would get out and open fire . She would never again feel safe.  |p125On  Saturday , August 13 , 1988 , seven months after Danny was shot down , Thelma Ackerson came to the mountain house to stay for four days . Laura was in the backyard , conducting target practice with her Smith &; Wesson .38 Chief 's Special . She had just reloaded , snapped the cylinder in place , and was about to put on her Hearing Guard headset when she heard a car approaching on the long gravel driveway from the state route . She picked up a pair of binoculars from the ground at her feet and took a closer look at the vehicle to be sure it was not an unwanted visitor . When she saw Thelma behind the wheel , she put the glasses down and continued firing at the target  --  an outline of a man 's head and torso  --  that was lashed to a hay-bale backstop . Sitting on the grass nearby , Chris plucked six more cartridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she had fired the last round currently in the cylinder . The day was hot , clear , and dry . Wildflowers by the hundreds blazed along the edge of the yard where the mown area gave way to wild grass and weeds near the forest line . Squirrels had been at play on the grass a while ago , and birds had been singing , but the shooting had temporarily frightened them away . Laura might have been expected to associate her husband 's death with the high retreat and to sell it . Instead she had sold the house in Orange County four months ago and moved Chris to the San Bernardinos . She believed that what had happened to them the previous January on route 330 could have happened anywhere . The place was not to blame ; the fault lay in her destiny , in the mysterious forces at work in her strangely troubled life . Intuitively she knew that if her guardian had not stepped in to save her on that stretch of snowy highway , he would have entered her lifep126elsewhere , at another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown up with a submachine gun , and the same set of violent , tragic events would have transpired . Their other home had held more memories of Danny than did the stone and redwood place south of Big Bear . She was better able to deal with her grief in the mountains than in Orange Park Acres . Besides , oddly enough , the mountains felt much safer to her . In the highly populated suburbs of Orange County , where the streets and freeways teemed with more than two million people , an enemy would not be perceived among the crowd until he chose to act . In the mountains , however , strangers were highly visible , especially since the house sat almost in the center of their thirty-acre property . And she had not forgotten her guardian 's warning : Arm yourself . Be prepared . If they come for you . . . there 'll be a squad of them . When Laura fired the last round in the .38 and pulled off the ear guards , Chris handed her six more cartridges . He removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check her accuracy . The backstop consisted of hay bales piled seven feet high and four deep ; it was fourteen feet wide . Behind it were acres of pine woods , her private land , so the need for an elaborate backstop was questionable , but she did not want to shoot anyone . At least not accidentally . Chris lashed up a new target and returned to Laura with the old one . " Four hits out of six , Mom . Two deaders , two good wounds , but looks like you 're pulling off to the left a little . " " Let 's see if I can correct that . " " You 're just getting tired , that 's all , " Chris said . The grass around her was littered with over a hundred and fifty empty brass shell casings . Her wrists , arms , shoulders , and neck were beginning to ache from the cumulative recoil , but she wanted to get in another full cylinderbefore quitting for the day . Back near the house , Thelma 's car door slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the binoculars to watch the target while his mother fired . Sorrow plucked at Laura as she paused to look at the boy , not merely because he was fatherless but because it seemed so unfair that a child two months short of his eighth birthday should already know how dangerous life was and should have to live in constant expectation of violence . She did her best to make sure there was as much fun in his life as possible : They still played with the Tommy Toad fantasy , though Chris no longer believed that Tommy was real ; through a large personal library of children 's classics , Laura also was showing him the pleasure and escape to be found in books ; she even did her best to make target practice a game and thereby divert the focus fromp127the deadly necessity of being able to protect themselves . Yet for the time being their lives were dominated by loss and danger , by a fear of the unknown . That reality could not be hidden from the boy , and it could not fail to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the binoculars and looked at her to see why she was not shooting . She smiled at him . He smiled at her . He had such a sweet smile it almost broke her heart . She turned to the target , raised the .38 , gripped it with both hands , and squeezed off the first shot of the new series . By the time Laura fired four rounds , Thelma stepped up beside her . She stood with her fingers in her ears , wincing . Laura squeezed off the last two shots and removed her ear guards , and Chris retrieved the target . The roar of gunfire was still echoing through the mountains when she turned to Thelma and hugged her . " What 's all this gun stuff ? " Thelma asked . " Are you going to write new movies for Clint Eastwood ? No , hey , better yet , write the female equal of Clint 's role  --  Dirty Harriet . And I 'm just the broad to play it  --  tough , cold , with a sneer that would make Bogart cringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part , " Laura said , " but what I 'd really like to see is Clint play it in drag . " " Hey , you 've still got a sense of humor , Shane . " " Did you think I would n't ? " Thelma frowned . " I did n't know what to think when I saw you blasting away , looking mean as a snake with fang decay . " " Self-defense , " Laura said . " Every good girl should learn some . " " You were plinking away like a pro . " Thelma noted the glitter of brass shell casings in the grass . " How often do you do this ? " " Three times a week , a couple of hours each time . " Chris returned with the target . " Hi , Aunt Thelma . Mom , you got four deaders out of six that time , one good wound , and a miss . " " Deaders ? " Thelma said . " Still pulling to the left , do you think ? " Laura asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not so much as last time . " Thelma said , " Hey , Christopher Robin , is that all I get  --  just a lousy Hi , Aunt Thelma ' ? " Chris put the target with the pile of others that he had taken down before it , went to Thelma , and gave her a big hug and a kiss . Noticing that she was no longer done up in punk style , he said , " Gee , what happened to you , Aunt Thelma ? You look normal . " " I look normal ? What is that  --  a compliment or an insult ? Just you remember , kid , even if your old Aunt Thelma looks normal , she is no such ap128thing . She is a comic genius , a dazzling wit , a legend in her own scrapbook . Anyway , I decided punk was passe . " They enlisted Thelma to help them collect empty shell casings . " Mom 's a terrific shot , " Chris said proudly . " She better be terrific with all this practice . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army of Amazon warriors . " To his mother , Chris said , " What 's that mean ? " " Ask me again in ten years , " Laura said . When they went into the house , Laura locked the kitchen door . Two deadbolts . She closed the Levelor blinds over the windows so no one could see them . Thelma watched these rituals with interest but said nothing . Chris put Raiders of the Lost Ark on the VCR in the family room and settled in front of the television with a bag of cheese popcorn and a Coke . In the adjacent kitchen Laura and Thelma sat at the table and drank coffee while Laura disassembled and cleaned the .38 Chief 's Special . ' The kitchen was big but cozy with lots of dark oak , used brick on two walls , a copper range hood , copper pots hung on hooks , and a dark blue , ceramic-tile floor . It was the kind of kitchen in which TV sitcom families worked out their nonsensical crises and attained transcendental enlightenment ( with heart ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Laura it seemed like an odd place to be cleaning a weapon designed primarily to kill other human beings . " Are you really afraid ? " Thelma asked . " Bet on it . " " But Danny was killed because you were unlucky enough to wander into the middle of a drug deal of some kind . Those people are long gone , right ? " " Maybe not . " " Well , if they were afraid that you might be able to identify them , they 'd have come to get you long before this . " " I 'm taking no chances . " " You got to ease up , kid . You ca n't live the rest of your life expecting someone to jump at you from the bushes . All right , you can keep a gun around the house . That 's probably wise . But are n't you ever going to go out into the world again ? You ca n't tote a gun with you everywhere you go . " " Yes , I can . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannon ? " " I take it in my purse wherever we go . " " Jesus , how 'd you get a permit to carry ? " " My husband was killed under strange circumstances by persons un/known . Those killers tried to shoot my son and me  --  and they are still at large . On top of all that , I 'm a rich and relatively famous woman . It 'd be a little odd if I could n't get a permit to carry . " Thelma was silent for a minute , sipping her coffee , watching Laura clean the revolver . Finally she said , " This is kind of spooky , Shane , seeing you so serious about this , so tense . I mean , it 's seven months since . . . Danny died . But you 're as skittish as if someone had shot at you yesterday . You ca n't maintain this level of tension or readiness or whatever you want to call it . That way lies madness . Paranoia . You 've got to face the fact that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , every minute . " " I can , though , if I have to . " " Oh , yeah ? What about right now ? Your gun 's disassembled . What if some barbarian thug with tattoos on his tongue started kicking down the kitchen door ? " The kitchen chairs were on rubber casters , so when Laura suddenly shoved away from the table , she rolled swiftly to the counter beside the refrigerator . She pulled open a drawer and brought out another .38 Chief 's Special . Thelma said , " What  --  am I sitting in the middle of an arsenal ? " Laura put the second revolver back in the drawer . " Come on . I 'll give you a tour . " Thelma followed her to the pantry . Hung on the back of the pantry door was an Uzi semiautomatic carbine . " That 's a machine gun . Is it legal to have one ? " " With federal approval , you can buy them at gunshops , though you can only get a semiautomatic ; it 's illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thelma studied her , then sighed . " Has this one been modified ? " " Yes . It 's fully automatic . But I bought it that way from an illegal dealer , not a gunshop . " " This is too spooky , Shane . Really . " She led Thelma into the dining room and showed her the revolver that was clipped to the bottom of the sideboard . In the living room a fourth revolver was clipped under an end table next to one of the sofas . A second modified Uzi was hung on the back of the foyer door at the front of the house . Revolvers were also hidden in the desk drawer in the den , in her office upstairs , in the master bathroom , and in the nightstand in her bedroom . Finally , she kept a third Uzi in the master bedroom . Staring at the Uzi that Laura pulled from under the bed , Thelma said , " Spookier and spookier . If I did n't know you better , Shane , I 'd think you 'd gone mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you 're really thisp130scared , you 've got to have some reason . But what about Chris around all these guns ? " " He knows not to touch them , and I know he can be trusted . Most Swiss families have members in the militia  --  nearly every male citizen there is prepared to defend his country , did you know that ?  --  with guns in almost every house , but they have the lowest rate of accidental shootings in the world . Because guns are a way of life . Children are taught to respect them from an early age . Chris 'll be okay . " As Laura put the Uzi under the bed again , Thelma said , " How on earth do you find an illegal gun dealer ? " " I 'm rich , remember ? " " And money can buy anything ? Okay , maybe that 's true . But , come on , how does a gal like you find an arms dealer ? They do n't advertise on Laundromatbulletin boards , I presume . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've learned how to find anyone or anything I need . " Thelma was silent as they returned to the kitchen . From the family room came the heroic music that accompanied Indiana Jones on all of his exploits . While Laura sat at the table and continued cleaning the revolver , Thelma poured fresh coffee for both of them . " Straight talk now , kiddo . If there 's really some threat out there that justifies all this armament , then it 's bigger than you can handle yourself . Why not bodyguards ? " " I do n't trust anyone . Anyone but you and Chris , that is . And Danny 's father , except he 's in Florida . " " But you ca n't go on like this , alone , afraid . . . . Working a spiral brush into the barrel of the revolver , Laura said , " I 'm afraid , yeah , but I feel good about being prepared . All my life I 've stood by while people I love have been taken from me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hell with that . From now on , I fight . If anyone wants to take Chris from me , they 're going to have to go through me to get him , they 'll have to fight a war . " " Laura , I know what you 're going through . But listen , let me play psychoanalysthere and tell you that you 're reacting less to any real threat than you are overreacting to a sense of helplessness in the face of fate . You ca n't thwart Providence , kid . You ca n't play poker with God and expect to win because you 've got a .38 in your purse . I mean , you lost Danny to violence , yeah , and maybe you could say that Nina Dockweiler would have lived if someone had put a bullet in the Eel when he first deserved it , but those are the only cases where lives of people you loved might 've been saved with guns . Your mother died in childbirth . Your father died of a heart attack . We lost Ruthie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you 've got top131keep perspective , you 've got to have a sense of humor about our vulnerability as a species , or you 'll wind up in an institution with people who talk to tree stumps and eat their belly-button lint . God forbid , but what if Chris got cancer ? You 're all prepared to blow away anyone who touches him , but you ca n't kill cancer with a revolver , and I 'm afraid you 're so crazy determined to protect him that you 'll fall to pieces if something like that happens , something you ca n't deal with , that no one can deal with . I worry about you , kid . " Laura nodded and felt a rush of warmth for her friend . " I know you do , " Thelma . And you can put your mind at ease . For thirty-three years I just endured ; now I 'm fighting back as best I can . If cancer were to strike me or Chris , I 'd hire all the best specialists , seek the finest possible treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of cancer , then I 'd accept defeat . Fighting does n't preclude enduring . I can fight , and if fighting fails , I can still endure . " For a long time Thelma stared at her across the table . At last she nodded . " That 's what I hoped to hear . Okay . End of discussion . On to other things . When do you plan to buy a tank , Shane ? " " They 're delivering it Monday . " " Howitzers , grenades , bazookas ? " " Tuesday . What about the Eddie Murphy movie ? " " We closed the deal two days ago , " Thelma said . " Really . My Thelma is going to star in a movie with Eddie Murphy ? " " Your Thelma is going to appear in a movie with Eddie Murphy . I do n't think I qualify as a star yet . " " You had fourth lead in that picture with Steve Martin , third lead in the picture with Chevy Chase . And this is second lead , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show ? Eight times , is n't it ? Face it , you 're a star . " " Low magnitude , maybe . Is n't it weird , Shane ? Two of us come from nothing , Mcllroy Home , and we make it to the top . Strange ? " " Not so strange , " Laura said . " Adversity breeds toughness , and the tough succeed . And survive . " Stefan left the snow-filled night in the San Bernardino Mountains and an instant later was inside the gate at the other end of Lightning Road . The gate resembled a large barrel , not unlike one of those that were popular in carnival funhouses , except that its inner surface was of highly polished copper rather than wood , and it did not turn under his feet . The barrel was eight feet in diameter and twelve feet long , and in a few steps he walked out of it , into thep132main , ground-floor lab of the institute , where he was certain that he 'd be met by armed men . The lab was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his snow-flecked peacoat and looked around in disbelief . Three walls of the thirty-by-forty-foot room were lined floor to ceiling with machinery that hummed and clicked unattended . Most of the overhead lamps were off , so the room was softly , eerily lit . The machinery supported the gate , and it featured scores of dials and gauges that glowed pale green or orange , for the gate  --  which was a breach in time , a tunnel to anywhen  --  was never shut down ; once closed , it could be reopened only with great difficulty and a tremendous expenditure of energy , but once open it could be maintained with comparatively little effort . These days , because the primary research work was no longer focused on developing the gate itself , the main lab was attended by institute personnel my for routine maintenance of the machinery and , of course , when a jaunt was in progress . If different circumstance had pertained , Stefan would never have been able to make the scores of secret , unauthorized trips that he had taken to monitor  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But though it was not unusual to find the lab deserted most times of the day , it was singularly strange now , for they had sent Kokoschka to stop him , and surely they would be waiting anxiously to learn how Kokoschka had fared in those wintry California mountains . They had to have entertained the possibility that Kokoschka would fail , that the wrong man would return from 1988 , and that the gate would have to be guarded until the situation was resolved . Where were the secret police in their black trenchcoats with paddedshoulders ? Where were the guns with which he had expected to be greeted ? He looked at the large clock on the wall and saw that it was six minutes past eleven o'clock , local time . That was as it should have been . He 'd begun the jaunt at five minutes till eleven that morning , and every jaunt ended exactly eleven minutes after it began . No one knew why , but no matter how long a time traveler spent at the other end of his journey , only eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Bernardinos for nearly an hour and a half , but only eleven minutes had transpired in his own life , in his own time . If he had stayed with Laura for months before pressing the yellow button on his belt , activating the beacon , he would still have returned to the institute only  --  and precisely  --  eleven minutes after he had left it . But where were the authorities , the guns , his angry colleagues expressing their outrage ? After discovering his meddling in the events of Laura 's life , after sending Kokoschka to get him and Laura , why would they walk away from the gate when they had to wait only eleven minutes to learn the outcome of the confrontation ?  |p133Stefan  took off his boots , peacoat , and shoulder holster , and tucked diem out of sight in a corner behind some equipment . He had left his white coat in the same place when he had departed on the jaunt , and now he slipped into it again . Baffled , still worried in spite of the lack of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ground-floor corridor and went looking for trouble . At two-thirty Sunday morning Laura was at her word processor in the office adjacent to the master bedroom , dressed in pajamas and a robe , sipping apple juice , and working on a new book . The only light in the room came from the electronic-green letters on the computer screen and from a small desk lamp tightly focused on a printout of yesterday 's pages . A revolver lay on the desk beside the script . The door to the dark hallway was open . She never closed any but the bathroom door these days because sooner or later a closed door might prevent her from hearing the stealthy progress of an intruder in another part of the house . The house had a sophisticated alarm system , but she kept interior doors open just in case . She heard Thelma coming down the hallway , and she turned just as her friend looked through the door . " Sorry if I 've made any noise that 's kept you awake . " " Nah . We nightclub types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you ? You usually up at this hour ? " " I do n't sleep well any more . Four or five hours a night is good for me . Instead of lying in bed , fidgeting , I get up and write . " Thelma pulled up a chair , sat , and propped her feet on Laura 's desk . Her taste in sleepwear was even more flamboyant than it had been in her youth : baggy silk pajamas in a red , green , blue , and yellow abstract pattern of squares and circles . " I 'm glad to see you 're still wearing bunny slippers , " Laura said . " It shows a certain constancy of personality . " " That 's me . Rock-solid . Ca n't buy bunny slippers in my size any more , so I have to buy a pair of furry adult slippers and a pair of kids ' slippers , snip the eyes and ears off the little ones and sew them on the big ones . What 're you writing ? " " A bile-black book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend at the beach . " Laura sighed and relaxed in her spring-backed armchair . " It 's a novelp134about death , about the injustice of death . It 's a fool 's project because I 'm trying to explain the unexplainable . I 'm trying to explain death to my ideal reader because then maybe I can finally understand it myself . It 's a book about why we have to struggle and go on in spite of that knowledge of our mortality , why we have to fight and endure . It 's a black , bleak , grim , moody , depressing , bitter , deeply disturbing book . " " Is there a big market for that ? " Laura laughed . " Probably no market at all . But once an idea for a novel seizes a writer . . . well , it 's like an inner fire that at first warms you and makes you feel good but then begins to eat you alive , burn you up from within . You ca n't just walk away from the fire ; it keeps burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write the damned book . Anyway , when I get stuck on this one , I turn to a nice little children 's book I 'm writing all about Sir Tommy Toad . " " You 're nuts , Shane . " " Who 's wearing the bunny slippers ? " They talked about this and that , with the easy camaraderie they had shared for twenty years . Perhaps it was Laura 's loneliness , more acute than in the days immediately following Danny 's murder , or maybe it was fear of the unknown , but for whatever reason she began to speak of her special guardian . In all the world only Thelma might believe the tale . In fact Thelma was spellbound , soon lowering her feet from the desk and sitting forward on her chair , never expressing disbelief , as the story unrolled from the day the junkie was shot until the guardian vanished on the mountain highway . When Laura had quenched that inner fire , Thelma said , " Why did n't you tell me about this . . . this guardian years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . It seemed like something . . . magical . Something I should keep to myself because if I shared it I 'd break the spell and never see him again . Then after he left me to deal with the Eel on my own , after he had done nothing to save Ruthie , I guess I just stopped believing in him . I never told Danny about him because by the time I met Danny my guardian was no more real to me than Santa Claus . Then suddenly . . . there he was again on the highway . " " That night on the mountain , he said he 'd be back to explain everything in a few days . . . ? " " But I have n't seen him since . I 've been waiting seven months , and I figure that when someone suddenly materializes it might be my guardian or , just as likely , another Kokoschka with a submachine gun . " The story had electrified Thelma , and she fidgeted on her chair as if a current were crackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about Kokoschka ? The cops find out anything about him ? " " Nothing . He was carrying no identification whatsoever . The Pontiac hep135was driving was stolen , just like the red Jeep . They ran his fingerprints through every file they 've got , came up empty-handed . And they ca n't interrogatea corpse . They do n't know who he was or where he came from or why he wanted to kill us . " " You 've had a long time to think about all this . So any ideas ? Who is this guardian ? Where did he come from ? " " I do n't know . " She had one idea in particular that she focused on , but it sounded mad , and she had no evidence to support the theory . She withheld it from Thelma not because it was crazy , however , but because it would sound so egomaniacal . " I just do n't know . " " Where 's this belt he left with you ? " " In the safe , " Laura said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the carpet . Together they pulled the wall-to-wall carpet off its tack strip in that corner , revealing the face of the safe , which was a cylinder twelve inches in diameter and sixteen inches deep . Only one item reposed within , and Laura withdrew it . They moved back to the desk to look at the mysterious article in better light . Laura adjusted the flexible neck of the lamp . The belt was four inches wide and was made of a stretchy , black fabric , perhaps nylon , through which were woven copper wires that formed intricate and peculiar patterns . Because of its width , the belt required two small bucklesrather than one ; those were also made of copper . In addition , sewn on the belt just to the left of the buckles , was a thin box the size of an old-fashioned cigarette case  --  about four inches by three inches , only three-quarters of an inch thick  --  and this , too , was made of copper . Even on close examination no way to open the rectangular copper box could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the lower left corner , less than an inch in diameter . Thelma fingered the odd material . " Tell me again what he said would happen if you pushed the yellow button . " " He just told me for God 's sake not to push it , and when I asked why not , he said , You wo n't want to go where it 'll take you . ' " They stood side by side in the glow of the desk lamp , staring at the belt that Thelma held . It was after four in the morning , and the house was as silent as any dead , airless crater on the moon . Finally Thelma said , " You ever been tempted to push the button ? " " No , never , " Laura said without hesitation . " When he mentioned the place to which it would take me . . . there was a terrible look in his eyes . And I know he returned there himself only with reluctance . I do n't know where he comes from , Thelma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , the place is just one step this side of hell . "  |p136Sunday  afternoon they dressed in shorts and T-shirts , spread a couple of blankets on the rear lawn , and made a long , lazy picnic of potato salad , cold cuts , cheese , fresh fruit , potato chips , and plump cinnamon rolls with lots of crunchy pecan topping . They played games with Chris , and he enjoyed the day enormously , partly because Thelma was able to shift her comic engine into a lower gear , producing one-liners designed for eight-year-olds . When Chris saw squirrels frolicking farther back in the yard , near the woods , he wanted to feed them . Laura gave him a pecan roll and said , " Tear it into little pieces and toss the pieces to them . They wo n't let you get too near . And you stay close to me , you hear ? " " Sure , Mom . " " Do n't you go all the way to the woods . Only about halfway . " He ran thirty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trees , then dropped to his knees . He tore pieces from the cinnamon roll and threw them to the squirrels , making those quick and cautious creatures edge a bit closer for each successive scrap . " He 's a good kid , " Thelma said . " The best . " Laura moved the Uzi to her side . " He 's only ten or twelve yards away , " Thelma said . " But he 's closer to the woods than to me . " Laura studied the shadows under the serried pines . Plucking a few potato chips from the bag , Thelma said , " Never been on a picnic with someone who brought a submachine gun . I sort of like it . Do n't have to worry about bears . " " It 's hell on ants , too . " Thelma stretched out on her side on the blanket , her head propped up on one bent arm , but Laura continued to sit with her legs crossed Indianfashion . Orange butterflies , as bright as condensed sunshine , darted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be coping , " Thelma said . " More or less , " Laura agreed . " There was a very bad time . He cried a lot , was n't emotionally stable . But that passed . They 're flexible at his age , quick to adapt , to accept . But as good as he seems . . . I 'm afraid there 's a darkness in him now that was n't there before and that is n't going to go away . " No , " Thelma said , " it wo n't go away . It 's like a shadow on the heart . But he 'll live , and he 'll find happiness , and there 'll be times when he 's not aware of the shadow at all . " While Thelma watched Chris luring the squirrels , Laura studied her friend 's profile . " You still miss Ruth , do n't you ? "  | " Every day for twenty years . Do n't you still miss your dad ? " " Sure , " Laura said . " But when I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like what you feel . Because we expect our parents to die before us , and even when they die prematurely , we can accept it because we 've always known it was going to happen sooner or later . But it 's different when the one who dies is a wife , husband , child . . . or sister . We do n't expect them to die on us , not early in life . So it 's harder to cope . Especially , I suppose , if she 's a twin sister . " " When I get a piece of good news  --  career news , I mean  --  the first thing I always think of is how happy Ruthie would have been for me . What about you , Shane ? You coping ? " " I cry at night . " " That 's healthy now . Not so healthy a year from now . " " I lie awake at night and listen to my heartbeat , and it 's a lonely sound . ' Thank God for Chris . He gives me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris , and we 're sort of family , do n't you think ? " " Not just sort of . We are family . You and me  --  sisters . " Laura smiled , reached out , and rumpled Thelma 's tousled hair . " But , " Thelma said , " being sisters does n't mean you get to borrow my clothes . " In the corridors and through the open doors of the institute 's offices and labs , Stefan saw his colleagues at work , and none of them had any special interest in him . He took the elevator to the third floor where just outside his office he encountered Dr. Wladyslaw Januskaya , who was Dr. Vladimir Penlovski 's longtime protege and second in charge of the time-travel research which originally had been called Project Scythe but which for several months now had been known by the apt code name Lightning Road . Januskaya was forty , ten years younger than his mentor , but he looked older than the vital , energetic Penlovski . Short , overweight , balding , with a blotchy complexion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth , wearing thick glasses that made his eyes look like painted eggs , Januskaya should have been a comic figure . But his unholy faith in the state and his zeal in working for the totalitarian cause were sufficient to counteract his comic potential ; indeed he was one of the more disturbing men involved with Lightning Road . " Stefan , dear Stefan , " Januskaya said , " I 've been meaning to tell you how grateful we are for your timely suggestion , last October , that the power supply to the gate should be provided by a secure generator . Your foresightp138has saved the project . If we were'till drawing from the municipal power lines . . . why , the gate would have collapsed half a dozen times by now , and we 'd be woefully behind schedule . " having returned to the institute in expectation of arrest , Stefan was confused to find his treachery undiscovered and startled to hear himself being praised by this evil worm . He had suggested switching the gate to a secure generator not because he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not wanted his own jaunts into Laura 's life to be interrupted by the failure of the public power supply . " I would not have thought last October that by this time we would have come to such a situation as this , with ordinary public services no longer to be trusted , " Januskaya said , shaking his head sadly , " the social order so thoroughlydisturbed . What must the people endure to see the socialist state of their dreams triumph , eh ? " " These are dark times , " Stefan said , meaning very different things than Januskaya meant . " But we will triumph , " Januskaya said forcefully . His magnified eyes filled with the madness that Stefan knew too well . " Through the Lightning Road , we will triumph . " He patted Stefan on the shoulder and continued down the hall . After Stefan watched the scientist walk nearly to the elevators , he said , " Oh , Dr. Januskaya ? " The fat white worm turned and looked at him . " Yes ? " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not yet today . " " He 's here , is n't he ? " " Oh , I 'd imagine so . He 's here pretty much as long as there 's anyone working , you know . He 's a diligent man . If we had more like Kokoschka we 'd have no doubt of ultimate triumph . Do you need to talk to him ? If I see him , should I send him to you ? " " No , no , " Stefan said . " It 's nothing urgent . I would n't want to interrupt him in other work . I 'm sure I 'll see him sooner or later . " Januskaya continued to the elevators , and Stefan went into his office , closing the door behind him . He crouched beside the filing cabinet that he had repositioned slightly to cover one-third of the grille in the corner ventilation chase . In the narrow space behind it , a bundle of copper wires was barely visible , coming out of the bottom slot in the grille . The wires were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugged into a wall outlet farther behind the cabinet . Nothing had been disconnected . He could reach behind the cabinet , set the timer , and in one to five minutes , depending on how big a twist he gave the dial , the institute would be destroyed.  |p139What  the hell is going on ? he wondered . He sat for a while at his desk , staring at the square of sky that he could see from one of his two windows : scattered , dirty gray clouds moving sluggishlyacross an azure backdrop . Finally he left his office , went to the north stairs , and climbed quickly past the fourth floor to the attic . The door opened with only a brief squeak . I le flipped the light switch and entered the long , half-finished room , stepping as softly as possible on the board floor . He checked three of the charges of plastique that he had hidden in the rafters two nights ago . The explosives had not been disturbed . He had no need to examine the charges in the basement . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one knew about either his intention of destroying the institute or his attempts to turn Laura 's life away from a series of ordained tragedies . No one except Kokoschka . Damn it , Kokoschka had to know because he had shown up on the mountain road with an Uzi . So why had n't Kokoschka told anyone else ? Kokoschka was an officer of the state 's secret police , a true fanatic , obedient and eager servant of the government , and personally responsible for the security of Lightning Road . On discovering a traitor at the institute , Kokoschka would not have hesitated to call in squads of agents to encircle the building , guard the gate , and interrogate everyone . Surely he would not have allowed Stefan to go to Laura 's aid on that mountain highway , then follow with the intent of killing them all . For one thing , he would want to detain Stefan and interrogate him to determine if Stefan had conspirators in the institute . Kokoschka had learned of Stefan 's meddling in the ordained flow of events in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not discovered the explosives in the institute  --  probably not , or he would have at least unwired them . Then for reasons of his own he had not reacted as a policemanbut as an individual . This morning he had followed Stefan through the gate , to that wintry afternoon in January of ' 88 , with intentions that Stefan did not now understand at all . It made no sense . Yet that was what had to have happened . What had Kokoschka been up to ? He would probably never know . Now Kokoschka was dead on a highway in 1988 , and soon someone at the institute would realize that he was missing . This afternoon at two o'clock , Stefan was scheduled to take an approved jaunt under the direction of Penlovski and Januskaya . He had intended to blow the institute  --  in two senses  --  at one o'clock , an hour before the sched/uled event . Now , at 11:43 , he dFcided that he would have to move faster than he originally intended , before Kokoschka 's disappearance caused alarm . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer , which was empty , and disconnected it from its slides , lifting it all the way out of the cabinet . IVired to the back of the drawer was a pistol , a Colt Commander 9mm Parabellum with a nine-round magazine , acquired on one of his illicit jaunts and brought back secretly to the institute . From behind another drawer he removed two high-tech silencers and four additional , fully loaded magazines . At his desk , working quickly lest someone enter without knocking , he screwed one of the silencers onto the pistol , flicked off the safety , and distributed the other silencer and magazines in the pockets of his lab coat . When he left the institute by way of the gate for the last time , he could not trust to the explosives to kill Penlovski , Januskaya , and certain other scientists . The blast would bring down the building and no doubt destroy all machinery and paper files , but what if just one of the key researchers survived ? The necessary knowledge to rebuild the gate was in Penlovski 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one other man , Volkaw , before he set the timer on the explosives and entered the gate to return to Laura . With the silencer attached , the Commander was too long to fit all the way in the pocket of his lab coat , so he turned the pocket inside out and tore the bottom of it . With his finger on the trigger , he shoved the gun into his now bottomless pocket and held it there as he opened his office door and went into the hallway . His heart pounded furiously . This was the most dangerous part of his plan , the killing , because there were so many opportunities for something to go wrong before he finished with the gun and returned to his office to set the timer on the explosives . Laura was a long way off , and he might never see her again . On Monday afternoon Laura and Chris dressed in gray sweat suits . After Thelma helped them unroll the thick gym mats on the patio at the back of the house , Laura and Chris sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Bruce Lee arrive ? " Thelma asked . " At two , " Laura said . " He 's not Bruce Lee , Aunt Thelma , " Chris said exasperatedly . " You keep calling him Bruce Lee , but Bruce Lee is dead . " Mr. Takahami arrived promptly at two o'clock . He was wearing a dark blue sweat suit , on the back of which was the logo for his martial arts school :  |p141I  QUIET STRENGTH . When introduced to Thelma , he said , " You 're a very funnylady . I love your record album . " Glowing from the praise , Thelma said , " And I can honestly tell you that I sincerely wish Japan had won the war . " Henry laughed . " I think we did . " Sitting on a sun lounger , sipping iced tea , Thelma watched while Henry instructed Laura and Chris in self-defense . He was forty years old , with a well-developed upper body and wiry legs . He was a master of judo and karate , as well as an expert kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on various martial arts , a system which he had devised himself . Twice a week he drove out from Riverside and spent three hours with Laura and Chris . The kicking , punching , poking , grunting , twisting , throwing , off-the-hip rolling combat was conducted gently enough not to cause injury but with enough force to teach . Chris 's lessons were less strenuous and less elaborate than Laura 's , and Henry gave the boy plenty of breaks to pause and recoup . But by the end of the session , Laura was , as always , dripping sweat and exhausted . When Henry left , Laura sent Chris upstairs to shower while she and Thelma rolled up the mats . " He 's cute , " Thelma said . " Henry ? I guess he is . " " Maybe I 'll take up judo or karate . " " Have your audiences been that dissatisfied lately ? " " That one was below the belt , Shane . " " Anything 's fair when the enemy 's formidable and merciless . " The following afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her Camaro for the return trip to Beverly Hills , she said , " Hey , Shane , you remember that first foster family you were sent to from Mcll-roy ? " " The Teagels , " Laura said . " Flora , Hazel , and Mike . " Thelma leaned against the sun-warmed side of the car next to Laura . " You remember what you told us about Mike 's fascination with newspapers like the National Enquirer ? " " I remember the Teagels as if I lived with them yesterday . " " Well , " Thelma said , " I 've been thinking a lot about what 's happened to you  --  this guardian , the way he never ages , the way he disappeared into thin air  --  and I thought of the Teagels , and it all seems sort of ironic to me . All those nights at Mcllroy , we laughed at nutty old Mike Teagel . . . and now what you find yourself in the middle of is a prime bit of exotic news . "  |p142Laura  laughed softly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living secretly in Cleveland , huh ? " " I guess what I 'm trying to say is . . . life is full of wonders and surprises . Some of them are nasty surprises , yeah , and some days are as dark as the inside of the average politician 's head . But just the same , there are momentsthat make me realize we 're all here for some reason , enigmatic as it might be . It 's not meaningless . If it was meaningless , there 'd be no mystery . It 'd be as dull and clear and lacking in mystery as the mechanism of a Mr. Coffee machine . " Laura nodded . " God , listen to me ! I 'm torturing the English language to come up with a half-baked philosophical statement that ultimately means nothing more than keep your chin up , kid . ' " " You 're not half-baked . " " Mystery , " Thelma said . " Wonder . You 're in the middle of it , Shane , and that 's what life 's all about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this too shall pass . They stood by the car , hugging , not needing to say more , until Chris ran out from the house with a crayon drawing he had done for Thelma and that he wanted her to take back to LA with her . It was a crude but charming scene of Tommy Toad standing outside a movie theater , gazing up at a marquee on which Thelma 's name was huge . He had tears in his eyes . " But do you really have to go , Aunt Thelma ? Ca n't you stay one more day ? " Thelma hugged him , then carefully rolled up the drawing as if in possession of a priceless masterwork . " I 'd love to stay , Christopher Robbin , but I ca n't . My adoring fans are crying for me to make this movie . Besides , I 've got a big mortgage . " " What 's a mortgage ? " " The greatest motivator in the world , " Thelma said , giving him a last kiss . She got into the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and winked at Laura . " Exotic news , Shane . " " Mystery . " " Wonder . " Laura gave her the three-finger greeting from Star Trek . Thelma laughed . " You 'll make it , Shane . In spite of the guns and all I 've learned since I came here on Friday , I 'm less worried about you now than I was then . " Chris stood at Laura 's side , and they watched Thelma 's car until it went down the long driveway and disappeared onto the state route.  |p143Dr  . Vladimir Penlovski 's large office suite was on the fourth floor of the institute . When Stefan entered the reception lounge , it was deserted , but he heard voices coming from the next room . He went to the inner door , which was ajar , pushed it all the way open , and saw Penlovski giving dictation to Anna Kaspar , his secretary . Penlovski looked up , mildly surprised to see Stefan . He must have perceivedthe tension in Stefan 's face , for he frowned and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wrong for a long time , " Stefan said , " but it 'll all be fine now , I think . " Then , as Penlovski 's frown deepened , Stefan pulled the silencer-equipped Colt Commander from the pocket of his lab coat and shot the scientist twice in the chest . Anna Kaspar sprang up from her chair , dropping her pencil and dictationpad , a scream caught in her throat . He did not like killing women  --  he did not like killing anyone  --  but there was no choice now , so he shot her three times , knocking her backward onto the desk , before the scream could tear free of her . Dead , she slid off the desk and crumpled to the floor . The shots had been no louder than the hissing of an angry cat , and the sound of the body dropping had been insufficient to draw attention . Penlovski was slumped in his chair , eyes and mouth open , staring sightlessly . One of the shots must have pierced his heart , for there was only a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cut off in an instant . Stefan backed out of the room , closed the door . He crossed the receptionlounge and , stepping into the hall , shut the outer door too . His heart was racing . With those two murders he had cut himself off forever from his own time , his own people . From here on , the only life for him was in Laura 's time . Now there was no turning back . With his hands  --  and the gun  --  jammed in his lab-coat pockets , he went clown the hall toward Januskaya 's office . As he neared the door , two of his other colleagues came out of it . They said hello as they passed him , and he stopped to see if they were heading for Penlovski 's office . If they were , he 'd have to kill them too . He was relieved when they stopped at the elevators . The more corpses he left strewn around , the more likely someone would be to stumble across one of them and sound an alarm that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaping by way of the Lightning Road . He went into Januskaya 's office , which also had a reception area . At thep144desk , the secretary  --  provided , as Anna Kaspar had been , by the secret police  --  looked up and smiled . " Is Dr. Januskaya here ? " Stefan asked . " No . He 's down in the documents room with Dr. Volkaw . " Volkaw was the third man whose overview of the project was great enough to require that he be eliminated . It seemed a good omen that he and Wladyslaw Januskaya were conveniently in the same place . In the documents room , they stored and studied the many books , newspapers , magazines , and other materials that had been brought back by time travelers from scheduled jaunts . These days the men who had conceived of Lightning Road were engaged in an urgent analysis of the key points at which alterations in the natural flow of events could provide the changes in the course of history that they desired . On the way down in the elevator , Stefan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first would muffle another dozen shots before its sound baffles were seriously damaged . But he did not want to overuse it . The second silencer was additional insurance . He also quickly exchanged the halfemptymagazine for a full one . The first-floor corridor was a busy place , with people coming and going from one lab and research room to another . He kept his hands in his pockets and went directly to the documents room . When Stefan entered , Januskaya and Volkaw were standing at an oak table , bent over a copy of a magazine , arguing heatedly but in low voices . They glanced Stefan put two bullets in Volkaw 's back . Januskaya reacted with confusion and shock as Volkaw flew forward into the table , driven by the impact of the nearly silent gunfire . Stefan shot Januskaya in the face , then turned and left the room , closing the door behind him . Not trusting himself to speak to one of his colleagues with any degree of self-control or coherence , he tried to appear to be lost in thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the elevators as quickly as possible without running , went to his third-floor office , reached behind the file cabinet , and twisted the dial on the timer as far as it would go , giving himself just five minutes to get to the gate and away before the institute was reduced to burning rubble.  |p145liy  the time the school year began , Laura had won approval for Chris to i cccive his education at home , from a state-accredited tutor . Her name was Ida Palomar , and she reminded Laura of Marjorie Main , the late actress in the Ma and Pa Kettle movies . Ida was a big woman , a bit gruff , but with a generous heart , and she was a good teacher . By the Thanksgiving school break , instead of feeling as if they were imprisoned , both she and Chris had accommodated to the relative isolation in which they lived . In fact they had actually come to enjoy the special closeness that developed between them as a result of having so few other people in their lives . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy holiday . Laura took the call in the kitchen , which was full of the aroma of roasting turkey . Chris was in the family room , reading Shel Silverstein . " Besides wishing you a happy holiday , " Thelma said , " I 'm calling to invite you down here to spend Christmas week with me and Jason . " " Jason ? " Laura said . " Jason Gaines , the director , " Thelma said . " He 's the guy who 's directingthis film I 'm making . I 've moved in with him . " " Does he know it yet ? " " Listen , Shane , I make the wisecracks . " " Sorry . " " He says he loves me . Is that crazy or what ? I mean , Jeez , here 's this decent-looking guy , only five years older than me , with no visible mutations , who 's a hugely successful film director , worth many millions , who could just about have any stacked little starlet he wanted , and the only one he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you would n't know it to talk to him , he could pass for normal . He says what he loves about me is I 've got a brain  --  " " Does he know how diseased it is ? " " There you go again , Shane . He says he loves my brain and sense of humor , and he 's even excited by my body  --  or if he is n't excited then he 's the first guy in history who could fake an erection . " " You 've got a perfectly lovely body . " " Well , I 'm beginning to consider the possibility that it 's not as bad as I always thought . That is , if you consider boniness to be the sine qua non of feminine beauty . But even if I am able to look at my bod in a mirror now , it 's still got this face perched atop it . "  | " You 've got a perfectly lovely face  --  especially now that it 's not surrounded by green and purple hair . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm mad for inviting you here for Christmas week . Jason will see you , and the next thing I 'll be sitting in a Glad trash bag at the curb . But what about it ? Will you come ? We 're shootingthe film in and around LA , and we 'll finish principal photography Decembertenth . Then Jason 's got a lot of work to do , what with the editing , the whole schmear , but Christmas week we 're just stopping . We 'd like you to be here . Say you will . " " I 'd sure like to meet the man smart enough to fall for you , Thelma , but I do n't know . I feel . . . safe here . " " What do you think  --  we 're dangerous ? " " You know what I mean . " " You can bring an Uzi . " " What will Jason think of that ? " " I 'll tell him you 're a radical leftist , save-the-sperm-whale , **35;15508;TOOLONG , parakeet liberationist and that you keep an Uzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without warning . He 'll buy it . This is Hollywood , kid . Most of the actors he works with are politically crazier than that . " Through the family-room archway , Laura could see Chris curled up in the armchair with his book . She sighed . " Maybe it is time we got out in the world once in a while . And it 's going to be a difficult Christmas if it 's just Chris and me , this being the first without Danny . But I feel uneasy . . . . " It 's been over ten months , Laura , " Thelma said gently . " But I 'm not going to let down my guard . " " You do n't have to . I 'm serious about the Uzi . Bring your whole arsenal if that 'll make you feel better . Just come . " " Well ... all right . " " Fantastic ! I ca n't wait for you to meet Jason . " " Do I detect that the love this brain-damaged Hollywood maven feels for you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thelma admitted . " I 'm happy for you , Thelma . In fact I 'm standing here now with a grin that wo n't stop , and nothing 's made me feel so good in months . " Everything she said was true . But after she hung up , she missed Danny more than ever.  |p147As  soon as he set the timer behind the filing cabinet , Stefan left his thirdflooroffice and went to the main lab on the ground floor . It was 12:14 , and because the scheduled jaunt was not until two o'clock , the main lab was deserted . The windows were sealed , and most of the overhead lights were still off , as they had been little more than an hour ago , when he had returned from the San Bernardinos . The multitude of dials , gauges , and lighted graphs of the support machinery glowed green and orange . More in shadow than in the light , the gate awaited him . Four minutes till detonation . He went directly to the primary programming board and carefully adjustedthe dials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination : southern California , near Big Bear , at eight o'clock on the night of January 10 , 1988 , just a few hours after Danny Packard had been killed . He had done the necessary calculations days ago and had them on a sheet of paper to which he referred , so he was able to program the machinery in only a minute . If he could have traveled to the afternoon of the tenth , prior to the accident and the shoot-out with Kokoschka , he would have done so in the hope of saving Danny . However , they had learned that a time traveler could not revisit a place if he scheduled his second arrival shortly before his previous jaunt ; there was a natural mechanism that prevented a traveler from being in a place where he might encounter himself on a previous jaunt . He could return to Big Bear after he had left Laura that January night , for having already departed from the highway , he was no longer at risk of encountering himself there . But if he set the gate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet himself , he would simply bounce back to the institutewithout going anywhere . That was one of many mysterious aspects of time travel which they had learned , around which they worked , but which they did not understand . When he finished programming the gate , he glanced at the latitude and longitude indicator to confirm that he would arrive in the general area of Big Bear . Then he looked at the clock that noted his arrival time , and he was startled to see that it showed 8:00 P.M. , January 10 , 1989 , instead of 1988 . The gate was now set to deliver him to Big Bear not hours after Danny 's death but a full year later . He was sure that his calculations were correct ; he 'd had plenty of time to make them and recheck them over the past couple of weeks . Evidently ,  |p148nervous  as he was , he had made a mistake when entering the numbers . He would have to reprogram the gate . Less than three minutes until detonation . He blinked sweat out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the end product of his extensive calculations . As he reached for a control knob to cancel out the current program and re-enter the first of the figures again , a shout of alarm went up in the ground-floor corridor . , The cries sounded as if they were coming from the north end of the building , in the general area of the document room . Someone had found the bodies of Januskaya and Volkaw . He heard more shouting . People running . Glancing nervously at the closed door to the hall , he decided he had no time to reprogram . He would have to settle for returning to Laura one year after he had last left her . With the silencer-fitted Colt Commander in his right hand , he rose from the programming console and headed toward the gate  --  that eight-foothigh , twelve-foot-long , polished steel , open-ended barrel resting a foot off the floor on copper-plated blocks . He did not even want to risk taking time to recover his peacoat from the corner where he had left it an hour ago . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a couple of steps from the entrance to the gate , the lab door was thrown open behind him with such force that it hit the wall with a crash . " Stop right there ! " Stefan recognized the voice , but he did not want to believe what he heard . He brought up the pistol as he swung around to confront his challenger : The man who had raced into the lab was Kokoschka . Impossible . Kokoschka was dead . Kokoschka had followed him to Big Bear on the night of January 10 , 1988 , and he had killed Kokoschka on that snowswept highway . Stunned , Stefan squeezed off two shots , both wide . Kokoschka returned his fire . One slug took Stefan in the chest , high on the left side , knocking him backward against the edge of the gate . He stayed on his feet and got off three shots at Kokoschka , forcing the bastard to dive for cover and roll behind a lab bench . They were less than two minutes from detonation . Stefan felt no pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was useless ; it hung limply at his side . And an insistent , oily blackness seeped in at the edges of his vision . Only a few overhead lights had been left on , but suddenly even they flickered and went out , leaving the room vaguely illuminated by the wan glow of the many glass-covered dials and gauges . For an instant Stefan thought thep149dying light was a further surrender of his consciousness , a subjective development , but then he realized the public power supply had failed again , evidentlydue to the work of saboteurs , for there had been no sirens to warn of an air attack . Kokoschka fired twice from darkness , the muzzle flash marking his position , and Stefan loosed the last three rounds in his pistol , though there was no hope of hitting Kokoschka through the marble lab bench . Thankful that the gate was powered by a secure generator and still functional , Stefan threw away the pistol and with his good hand gripped the rim of the barrel-shaped portal . He pulled himself inside and crawled franticallytoward the three-quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depart this place for Big Bear , 1989 . As he hitched on two knees and one good arm through the gloomy interior of the barrel , he abruptly realized that the timer on the detonator in his office was connected to the public power supply . The countdown to destruction had been interrupted when the lights had gone out . With dismay he understood , why Kokoschka was not dead in Big Bear in 1988 . Kokoschka had not made that trip yet . Kokoschka had only now learned of Stefan 's perfidy , when he had discovered the bodies of Januskaya and Volkaw . Before the public power supply was restored , Kokoschka would search Stefan 's office , find the detonator , and disarm the explosives . The institute would not be destroyed . Stefan hesitated , wondering if he should go back . Behind him he heard other voices in the lab , other security men arriving to reinforce Kokoschka . He crawled forward . And what of Kokoschka ? The security chief evidently would travel to January 10 , 1988 , trying to kill Stefan on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill Danny before being killed himself . Stefan was pretty sure that Kokoschka 's death was an immutable destiny , but he would need to think more about the paradoxes of time travel , to see if there was any way Kokoschka could escape being gunned down in 1988 , a death that Stefan had already witnessed . The complications of time travel were confusing even when one ponderedthem with a clear head . In his condition , wounded and struggling to remain conscious , he only grew dizzier thinking about such things . Later . He would worry about it later . Behind him in the dark laboratory , someone began firing into the entrance of the gate , hoping to hit him before he reached the point of departure . He crawled the last couple of feet . Toward Laura . Toward a new life in a distant time . But he had hoped to close forever the bridge between the era hep150was leaving and that to which he was now pledging himself . Instead the gate would remain open . And they could come across time to get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas with Thelma at Jason Gaines 's house in Beverly Hills . It was a twenty-two-room , Tudor-style mansion on six , walled acres , a phenomenally large property in an area where the cost per acre had long ago escalated far beyond reason . During construction in the ' 40s  --  it had been built by a producer of screwball comedies and war movies  --  no compromiseshad been made in quality , and the rooms were marked by beautiful detail work that could not have been duplicated these days at ten times the original cost : There were intricately coffered ceilings , some made of oak , some of copper ; crown moldings were elaborately carved ; the leaded windows were of stained or beveled glass , and they were set so deep in the castle-thick walls that one could comfortably sit on the wide sills ; interior lintels were decorated with hand-carved panels  --  vines and roses , cherubs and banners , leaping deer , birds with ribbons trailing from their bills ; exterior lintels were of carved granite , and in two were set mortared clusters of colorful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the house was a meticulously maintained private park where winding stone pathways led through a tropical landscape of palms , benjaminas , ficus nidida , azaleas laden with brilliant red blossoms , impatiens , ferns , birds of paradise , and seasonal flowers of so many species that Laura could identify only half of them . When Laura and Chris arrived early on Thursday afternoon , the day before Christmas , Thelma took them on a long tour of the house and grounds , after which they drank hot cocoa and ate miniature pastries prepared by the cook and served by the maid in the airy sun porch that looked out upon the swimming pool . " Is this a crazy life , Shane ? Can you believe that the same girl who spent almost ten years in holes like Mcllroy and Caswell could end up living here without first having to be reincarnated as a princess ? " The house was so imposing that it encouraged anyone who owned it to feel Important with a capital I , and anyone in possession of it would be hardpressedto avoid smugness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock , he proved to be as unpretentious as anyone Laura knew , amazingly so for a man who had spent seventeen years in the movie business . He was thirty-eight , five years older than Thelma , and he looked like a younger Robert Vaughn , which was a lot better than " decent-looking , " as Thelma had referred to him . He was home less than half an hour before hep151and Chris huddled in one of his three hobby rooms , playing with an electric train set that covered a fifteen-by-twenty-foot platform , complete with detailedvillages , rolling countryside , windmills , waterfalls , tunnels , and bridges . That night , with Chris asleep in the room adjoining Laura 's , Thelma visited her . In their pajamas they sat cross-legged on her bed , as if they were girls again , though they ate roasted pistachios and drank Christmas champagneinstead of cookies and milk . " The weirdest thing of all , Shane , is that in spite of where I came from , I feel as if I belong here . I do n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place , either . Though she was still recognizably Thelma Ackerson , she had changed in the past few months . Her hair was better cut and styled ; she had a tan for the first time in her life ; and she carried herself more like a woman and less like a comic trying to win laughter  --  meaning approval  --  with each funny gesture and posture . She was wearing less flamboyant  --  and sexier  --  pajamas than usual : clingy , unpatterned , peach-colored silk . She was , however , still sporting bunny slippers . " Bunny slippers , " she said , " remind me of who I am . You ca n't get a swelled head if you wear bunny slippers . You ca n't lose your sense of perspectiveand start acting like a star or a rich lady if you keep on wearing bunny slippers . Besides , bunny slippers give me confidence because they 're so jaunty ; they make a statement ; they say , Nothing the world does to me can ever get me so far down that I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found myself in hell , I could endure the place if I had bunny slippers . " Christmas Day was like a wonderful dream . Jason proved to be a sentimentalistwith the undiminished wonder of a child . He insisted they gather at the Christmas tree in pajamas and robes , that they open their gifts with as much popping of ribbons and noisy tearing of paper and as much general drama as possible , that they sing carols , that while opening gifts they abandonthe idea of a healthy breakfast and instead eat cookies , candy , nuts , fruitcake , and caramel popcorn . He proved that he had not just been trying to be a good host when he had spent the previous evening with Chris at the trains , for all Christmas Day he engaged the boy in one form of play or another , both inside and outside the house , and it was clear that he had a love of and natural rapport with kids . By dinnertime Laura realized Chris had laughed more in one day than in the entire past eleven months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , he said , " What a great day , huh , Mom ? " " One of the all-time greats , " she agreed . " All I wish , " he said as he dropped toward sleep , " is that Daddy could 've been here to play with us . " " I wish the same thing , honey . " " But in a way he was here , ' cause I thought of him a lot . Will I alwaysp152remember him , Mom , the way he was , even after dozens and dozens of years , will I remember him ? " " I 'll help you remember , baby . " " Because sometimes already there are little things I do n't quite rememberabout him . I have to think hard to remember them . But I do n't want to forget ' cause he was my daddy . " When he was asleep , Laura went through the connecting door to her own bed . She was immensely relieved when a few minutes later Thelma came by for another girl-to-girl , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad hours there . " If I had babies , Shane , " Thelma said , climbing into Laura 's bed , " do you think there 's any chance at all that they 'd be allowed to live in society , or would they be banished to some ugly-kid equivalent of a leper colony ? " " Do n't be silly . " " Of course , I could afford massive plastic surgery for them . I mean , even if it turns out that their species is questionable , I could afford to have them made passably human . " " Sometimes your put-downs of yourself make me angry . " " Sorry . Chalk it up to not having a supportive mom and dad . I 've got both the confidence and doubt of an orphan . " She was quiet for a moment , then laughed and said , " Hey , you know what ? Jason wants to marry me . I thought at first he was possessed by a demon and unable to control his tongue , but he assures me we 've no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor stroke . So what do you think ? " " What do I think ? What 's that matter ? But for what it 's worth , he 's a terrific guy . You are going to grab him , are n't you ? " " I worry that he 's too good for me . " " No one 's too good for you . Marry him . " " I worry that it wo n't work out , and then I 'll be devastated . " " And if you do n't give it a try , " Laura said , " you 'll be worse than devastated  --  you 'll be alone . " Stefan felt the familiar , unpleasant tingle that accompanied time travel , a peculiar vibration that passed inward from his skin , through his flesh , into the marrow of his bones , then swiftly back out again from bones to flesh to skin . With a pop-wh0000sh he left the gate , and in the same instant he was stumbling down a steep , snow-covered slope in the California mountains on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on his wounded side , rolled to the bottom of the slope ,  |p153where  he came to rest against a rotted log . Pain flashed through him for the first time since he had been shot . He cried out and flopped onto his back , biting his tongue to keep from passing out , blinking up at the tumultuous night . Another thunderbolt ripped the sky , and light seemed to pulse from the jagged wound . By the spectral glow of the snow-covered earth and by the fierce but fitful flashes of lightning , Stefan saw that he was in a clearing in a forest . Leafless , black trees thrust bare limbs toward the fulminous sky , as if they were fanatical cultists praising a violent god . Evergreens , boughs droopingunder surplices of snow , stood like the solemn priests of a more decorous religion . Arriving in a time other than his own , a traveler disrupted the forces of nature in some way that required the dissipation of tremendous energy . Regardlessof the weather at the point of arrival , the imbalance was corrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ethereal highway on which time travelers journeyed was called the Lightning Road . For reasons no one had been able to ascertain , a return to the institute , to the traveler 's own era , was marked by no celestial pyrotechnics . The lightning subsided , as it always did , from bolts worthy of the Apocalypseto distant flickerings . In a minute the night was dark and calm again . As the thunderbolts had faded , his pain had increased . It almost seemed as if the lightning that had cracked the vaults of heaven was now captured within his chest , left shoulder , and left arm , too great a power for mortal flesh to contain or endure . He got onto his knees and rose shakily to his feet , worried that he had little chance of getting out of the woods alive . But for the phosphorescent glow of the snow-mantled clearing , the cloudy night was cellar-black , forbidding . Though undisturbed by wind , the winter air was icy , and he was wearingonly a thin lab coat over shirt and pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any landmark by which he could reckon his position . If the gate was considered as a gun , its accuracy was remarkable for the temporal distance covered to the target , but it was far from perfect in its aim . A traveler usually arrived within ten or fifteen minutesof the time he intended , but not always with the desired geographic precision . Sometimes he touched down within a hundred yards of his physicaldestination , but on other occasions he was as far as ten or fifteen miles off , as on the day that he had traveled to January 10 , 1988 , to save Laura , Danny , and Chris from the Robertsons ' sliding pickup truck . On all previous trips , he had carried both a map of the target area and a compass , lest he find himself in just such a place of isolation as he had arrived at now . But this time , having left his peacoat in the corner of the lab , he hadp154neither compass nor map , and the occluded sky deprived him of the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stars . He stood in snow almost to his knees , wearing street shoes , no boots , and he felt as if he must start moving immediately or freeze to the ground . He looked around the clearing , hoping for inspiration , for a twinge of intuition , but at last he chose a direction at random and headed to his left , searching for a deer trail or other natural course that would provide him a passage through the forest . His entire left side from neck to waist throbbed with pain . He hoped that the bullet , in passing through him , had torn no arteries and that the rate of blood loss was slow enough to allow him at least to reach Laura and see her face , the face he loved , one last time before he died . The one-year anniversary of Danny 's death fell on a Sunday , which was the same day of the week that he had been murdered , and although Chris did not mention the significance of the date , he was aware of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that somber day playing silently with his Masters of the Universe action figures in the family room , which was the kind of play ordinarily characterized by vocal imitations of laser weapons , clashing swords , and spaceship engines . Later he sprawled on his bed in his room , reading comic books . He resisted Laura 's every effort to draw him out of his self-imposed isolation , which was probably for the best ; any attempt she made to be cheerful would have been transparent , and he would have been further depressed by the perception that she was also struggling mightilyto turn her thoughts away from their grievous loss . Thelma , who had called only days before to report the good news that she had decided to marry Jason Gaines , called again at seven-fifteen that evening , just to chat , as if she were unaware of the importance of the date . Laura took the call in her office , where she was still struggling with the bileblackbook that had occupied her for the past year . " Hey , Shane , guess what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate a recording contract , and we were at the same party Friday night . When I first saw him , he was stuffing an hors d'oeuvre in his mouth , he said hello , he had crumbs on his lip , and he was gorgeous . He said he 'd seen my movies , thought I was very good , and we talked  --  you believe this ?  --  we must 've chatted twenty minutes , and gradually the strangest thing hap-pened . " " You discovered that you 'd undressed him while you were talking . " " Well , he still looks very good , you know , still that cherub face we swooned over twenty years ago but marked now by experience , tres sophisticatedand with an extremely appealing touch of sadness about his eyes , andp155he was enormously amusing and charming . At first maybe I did want to tear his clothes off , yeah , and live out the fantasy at last . But then the longer we talked , the less he seemed like a god , the more he seemed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaporated , and be was just this very nice , attractive , middle-aged man . Now what do you make of that ? " " What am I supposed to make of it ? " " I do n't know , " Thelma said . " I 'm a little disturbed . Should n't a living legend continue to awe you longer than twenty minutes after you meet him ? I mean , I 've met lots of stars by now , and none of them have remained godlike , but this was McCartney . " " Well , if you want my opinion , his swift loss of mythological stature says nothing negative about him , but it says plenty positive about you . You 've achieved a new maturity , Ackerson . " " Does this mean I 've got to give up watching old Three Stooges movies every Saturday morning ? " " The Stooges are permitted , but food fights are definitely a thing of the past for you . " By the time Thelma hung up at ten minutes till eight , Laura was feeling slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tale about Sir Tommy Toad . She had written only two sentences of the children 's story when the night beyond the windows was lit by a bolt of lightning bright enough to spark dire thoughts of nuclear holocaust . The subsequent thunderclapshook the house from roof to foundation , as if a wrecker 's ball had slammed into one of the walls . She came to her feet with a start , so surprised that she did not even hit the " save " key on the computer . A second bolt seared the night , making the windows as luminous as television screens , and the thunder that followed was louder than the first explosion . " Mom ! " She turned and saw Chris standing in the doorway . " It 's okay , " she said . He ran to her . She sat in the spring-backed armchair and pulled him onto her lap . " It 's all right . Do n't be afraid , honey . " " But it 's not raining , " he said . " Why 's it booming like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incredible series of lightning bolts and overlapping thunderclapscontinued for nearly a minute , then subsided . The power of the event had been so great , Laura was able to imagine that in the morning they would find the broken sky lying about in huge chunks like fragments of a giant eggshell . Before he walked five minutes from the clearing in which he had arrived , Stefan was forced to pause and lean against the thick trunk of a pinep156whose branches began just above his head . The pain of his wound wrung streams of sweat from him , yet he was shivering in the bitter January cold , too dizzy to stand up , yet terrified of sitting down and falling into an endless sleep . With the drooping boughs of that mammoth pine overhead and all around , he felt as if he had taken refuge under Death 's black robe , from which he might not emerge . Before putting Chris to bed for the night , she made sundaes for them with coconut-almond ice cream and Hershey 's syrup . They ate at the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted . Perhaps by marking the end of that sad anniversary with such drama , the bizarre weather phenomenonhad startled him out of thoughts of death and into the contemplation of wonders . He was filled with talk of the lightning that had crackled down a kite string and into Dr. Frankenstein 's laboratory in the old James Whale film , which he 'd seen for the first time a week ago , and of the lightning that had frightened Donald Duck in a Disney cartoon , and of the stormy night in 101 Dalmations during which Drusilla DeVille had posed such a dire threat to the title-role puppies . By the time she tucked him in and kissed him goodnight , he was approachingsleep with a smile  --  a half smile , at least  --  rather than with the frown that had weighed upon his face all day . She sat in a chair by the side of his bed until he was fast asleep , though he was no longer afraid and did not require her presence . She stayed simply because she needed to look at him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but before going to the word processor , she stopped at a window and stared out at the snow-swathed front lawn , at the black ribbon of the graveled driveway leading to the distant state route , and up at the starless , night sky . Something about the lightning deeply disturbed her : not that it had been so strange , not that it had been potentially destructive , but that the unprecedented and almost supernatural power of it had been somehow . . . familiar . She seemed to recall having witnessed a similar stormy display on another occasion , but she could not remember when . It was an uncanny feeling , akin to deja vu , and it would not fade . She went into the master bedroom and checked the security-control panel in her closet to be sure the perimeter alarm covering all the windows and doors was engaged . From beneath the bed , she withdrew the Uzi , which had an extended magazine holding four hundred rounds . She took the gun back to her office and put it on the floor by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning split the night again , frighteningher , and it was followed at once by a crack of thunder she felt in herp157bones . Another bolt and another and another blazed in the windows like a series of leering , ghostly faces formed of ectoplasmic light . As the heavens quaked with scintillant shudders , Laura hurried to Chris 's room to calm him . To her surprise , though the lightning and thunder were shockingly more violent than they had been previously , the boy was not awakened , perhaps because the din seemed a part of some dream he was having about Dalmatian puppies on a stormy night of adventure . Again , no rain fell . The lightning and thunder quickly subsided , but her anxiety remained high . He saw strange ebony shapes in the darkness , things that slipped between the trees and watched him with eyes blacker than their bodies , but though they startled and frightened him , he knew that they were not real , only phantoms spawned by his increasingly disoriented mind . He plodded onward in spite of outer cold , inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that sometimes tilted out from beneath his feet and sometimes spun like a phonograph turntable . The pain in his chest and shoulder and arm was so intense that he was assailed by delirium images of rats gnawing at his flesh from within his body , though he could not figure how they had gotten in there . After wandering for at least an hour  --  it seemed like many hours , even days , but it could not have been days because the sun had not risen  --  he came to the perimeter of the forest and , at the far end of a sloping half acre of snow-mantled lawn , he saw the house . Lights were vaguely visible at the edges of the blind-covered windows . He stood , disbelieving , at first convinced that the house was no more real than the Stygian figures that had accompanied him through the woods . Then he began moving toward the mirage  --  in case it was n't a fever dream , after all . When he had taken only a few steps , a lash of lightning whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly , and each time a stronger arm seemed to power it . Stefan 's shadow leaped and writhed on the snow around him , though he was temporarily paralyzed by fear . Sometimes he had two shadows because lightning silhouetted him simultaneously from two directions . Already welltrainedhunters had followed him on the Lightning Road , determined to stop him before he had a chance to warn Laura . He looked back at the trees out of which he had come . Under the stroboscopic sky , the evergreens seemed to jump toward him , then back , then toward him again . He saw no hunters there.  |p158As  the lightning faded , he staggered toward the house again . He fell twice , struggled up , kept moving , though he was afraid that if he fell again he would not be able to get to his feet or shout loud enough to be heard . Staring at the computer screen , trying to think about Sir Tommy Toad and thinking instead of the lightning , Laura suddenly recalled when she previously had seen such a preternaturally stormy sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her about Sir Tommy , the day that the junkie had come into the grocery , the day that she had seen her guardian for the first time , that summer of her eighth year . She sat up straight in her chair . Her heart began to hammer hard , fast . Lightning of that unnatural power meant trouble of a specific nature , trouble for her . She could recall no lightning on the day that Danny died or when her guardian appeared in the cemetery during her father 's burial service . But with an absolute certainty that she could not explain , she knew that the phenomenon she had witnessed tonight held a terrible meaning for her ; it was an omen and not a good one . She grabbed the Uzi and made a circuit of the upstairs , checking all the windows , looking in on Chris , making sure everything was as it should be . Then she hurried downstairs to inspect those rooms . As she stepped into the kitchen , something thumped against the back door . With a gasp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung the Uzi around , and nearly opened fire . But it was not the determined sound of someone breaking in . It was an unthreatening thump , barely louder than a knock , repeated twice . She thought she heard a voice , too , weakly calling her name . Silence . She edged to the door and listened for perhaps half a minute . Nothing . The door was a high-security model with a steel core sandwiched between two inch-thick slabs of oak , so she was not worried about being shot by a gunman on the other side . Yet she hesitated to move directly to it and peer through the fisheye lens because she feared seeing an eye pressed to the other side , trying to peer in at her . When at last she had the courage for it , the peephole gave her a wide-angled view of the patio , and she saw a man sprawled on the concrete , his arms flung out at his sides , as if he had fallen backward after knocking on the door . Trap , she thought . Trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept to the Levelor-covered window above the built-in writing desk . Cautiously she lifted one of the slats.  |p159The  man on the concrete patio was her guardian . His shoes and trousers were caked with snow . He wore what appeared to be a white lab coat , the front darkly stained with blood . As far as she could see , no one was crouched on the patio or on the lawn beyond , but she had to consider the possibility that someone had dumped his body there as a lure to bring her out of the house . Opening the door at night , tinder these circumstances , was foolhardy . Nevertheless she could not leave him out there . Not her guardian . Not if he was hurt and dying . She pressed the alarm bypass button next to the door , disengaged the dead-bolt locks , and reluctantly stepped into the wintry night with the Uzi at the ready . No one shot at her . On the dimly snow-illumined lawn , all the way back to the forest , nothing moved . She went to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pulse . He was alive . She peeled back one of his eyelids . He was unconscious . The wound high in the left side of his chest looked bad , though it did not appear to be bleeding at the moment . Her training with Henry Takahami and her regular exercise program had dramatically increased her strength , but she was not strong enough to lift the wounded man with one arm . She propped the Uzi by the back door and found she could not lift him even with both arms . It seemed dangerous to move a man who was so badly hurt , but more dangerous to leave him in the frigid night , especially when someone was apparently in pursuit of him . She managed to half lift and half drag him into the kitchen , where she stretched him out on the floor . With relief she retrieved the Uzi , relocked the door , and engaged the alarm again . He was frighteningly pale and cold to the touch , so the immediate necessity was to strip off his shoes and socks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with his left foot and was unlacing his right shoe , he was mumbling in a strange language , the words too slurred for her to identify the tongue , and in English he muttered about explosives and gates and " phantoms in the trees . " Though she knew that he was delirious and very likely could not understand her any more than she could understand him , she spoke to him reassuringly : ) " Easy now , just relax , you 'll be all right ; as soon as I get/your foot out of this block of ice , I 'll call a doctor . " The mention of a doctor brought him briefly out of his confusion . He gripped her arm weakly , fixed her with an intense , fearful gaze . " No doctor . Get out . . . got to get out . . . . " " You 're in no condition to go anywhere , " she told him . " Except by ambulance to a hospital . " " Got to get out . Quick . They 'll be coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Uzi . " Who will be coming ? " " Assassins , " he said urgently . " Kill me for revenge . Kill you , kill Chris . Coming . Now . " At that moment there was no delirium in his eyes or voice . His pale , sweat-slick face was no longer slack but taut with terror . All her training with guns and in the martial arts no longer seemed like hysterical precautions . " Okay , " she said , " we 'll get out as soon as I 've had a look at that wound , see if it needs to be dressed . " " No ! Now . Out now . " " But  --  " " Now , " he insisted . In his eyes was such a haunted look , she could almost believe that the assassins of whom he spoke were not ordinary men but creatures of some supernatural origin , demons with the ruthlessness and relentlessness of the soulless . " Okay , " she said . " We 'll get out now . " His hand fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus , and he began to mumble thickly , senselessly . As she hurried across the kitchen , intending to go upstairs and wake Chris , she heard her guardian speak dreamily yet anxiously of a " great , black , rolling machine of death , " which meant nothing to her but frightened her nonetheless.  |p163Laura  switched on a lamp and shook Chris awake . " Get dressed , honey . Quickly . " " What 's happening ? " he asked sleepily , rubbing his eyes with his small fists . " Some bad men are coming , and we 've got to get out of here before they arrive . Now hurry . " Chris had spent a year not only mourning his father but preparing for the moment when the deceptively placid events of daily life would be disruptedby another unexpected explosion of the chaos that lay at the heart of human existence , the chaos that from time to time erupted like an active volcano , as it had done the night his father had been murdered . Chris had watched his mother become a first-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arsenal , had taken self-defense classes with her , and through it all he had retained the point of view and attitudes of a child , had seemed pretty much like any other child , if understandably melancholy since the death of his father . But now in a moment of crisis he did not react like an eight-yearold ; he did not whine or ask unnecessary questions ; he was not quarrelsome or stubborn or slow to obey . He threw back the covers , got out of bed at once , and hurried to the closet . " Meet me in the kitchen , " Laura said . " Okay , Mom . " She was proud of his responsible reaction and relieved that he would not delay them , but she was also saddened that at eight years of age he understoodenough about the brevity and harshness of life to respond to a crisis with the swiftness and equanimity of an adult . She was wearing jeans and a blue-plaid , flannel shirt . When she went top164her bedroom , she only had to slip into a wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a pair of rubberized hiking boots with lace-up tops . She had gotten rid of Danny 's clothes , so she had no coat for the wounded man in the kitchen . She had plenty of blankets , however , and she grabbed two of those from the linen closet in the hall . As an afterthought , she went to her office , opened the safe , and removed the strange black belt with copper fittings that her guardian had given her a year ago . She jammed it in her satchel-like purse . Downstairs she stopped at the front foyer closet for a blue ski jacket and the Uzi carbine that hung on the back of the door . As she moved she was alert for unusual noises  --  voices in the night beyond the house or the sound of a car engine  --  but all remained silent . In the kitchen she put the submachine gun on the table with the other one , then knelt beside her guardian , who was unconscious again . She unbuttoned his snow-wet lab coat , then his shirt , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in his left shoulder , well above the heart , which was good , but he had lost a lot of blood ; his clothes were soaked with it . " Mom ? " Chris was in the doorway , dressed for a winter night . " Take one of those Uzis from the table , get the third one from the back of the pantry door , and put them in the Jeep . " " It 's him , " Chris said , wide-eyed with surprise . " Yes , it is . He showed up like this , hurt bad . Besides the Uzis , get two of the revolvers  --  the one in the drawer over there and the one in the dining room . And be careful not to accidentally  --  " " Do n't worry , Mom , " he said , setting off on the errands . As gently as possible she rolled her guardian onto his right side  --  he groaned but did not awaken  --  to see if there was an exit wound in his back . Yes . The bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His back was soaked with blood , too , but neither the entry nor exit point was bleeding heavily any longer ; if there was serious bleeding , it was internal , and she could not detect or treat it . Under his clothing he wore one of the belts . She unbuckled it . The belt would n't fit in the center compartment of her purse , so she had to stuff it into a zippered side compartment after dumping out the items she usually kept in there . She rebuttoned his shirt and debated whether she should take off his damp lab coat . She decided it would be too difficult to wrestle the sleeves down his arms . Rolling him gently from side to side , she worked a gray wool blanket under and around him . While Laura bundled up the wounded man , Chris made a couple of trips to the Jeep with the guns , using the inner door that connected the laundry room to the garage . Then he came in with a two-foot-wide , four-foot/long , flat dolly  --  essentially a wooden platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture deliverymen almost a year and a half ago . Riding it like a skateboard toward the pantry , he said , " We got ta take the ammo box , but it 's too heavy for me to carry . I 'll put it on this . " Pleased by his initiative and cleverness , she said , " We have twelve rounds in the two revolvers and twelve hundred rounds in the three Uzis , so I do n't think we 'll need more than that , no matter what happens . Bring the board here . Quick now . I 've been trying to figure how we can get him to the Jeep without shaking him up too bad . That looks like the ticket . " They were moving fast , as if they had drilled for just this particular emergency , yet Laura felt that they were taking too much time . Her hands were shaking , and her belly fluttered continuously . She expected someone to hammer on the door at any moment . Chris held the dolly still while Laura heaved the wounded man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , shoulders , back , and buttocks , she was able to lift his legs and push him as if he were a wheelbarrow . Chris scooted along at a crouch by the front wheels , one hand on the unconscious man 's right shoulder to keep him from sliding off and to prevent the board from rolling out from beneath him . They had a little trouble easing across the door sill at the end of the laundry room , but they got him into the three-car garage . The Mercedes was on the left , the Jeep wagon on the right , with the middle slot empty . They wheeled her guardian to the Jeep . Chris had opened the tailgate . He had also unrolled a small gym mat in there for a mattress . " You 're a great kid , " she told him . Together they managed to transfer the wounded man from the dolly into the cargo bed by way of the open tailgate . " Bring the other blanket and his shoes from the kitchen , " she told Chris . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gotten her guardian stretched out flat on his back on the gym mat . They covered his bare feet with the second blanket and put his soggy shoes beside him . As Laura shut the tailgate , she said , " Chris , get in the front seat and buckle up . " She hurried back into the house . Her purse , which contained all of her credit cards , was on the table ; she slipped the straps over her shoulder . She picked up the third Uzi and headed back toward the laundry room , but before she had taken three steps , something hit the rear door with tremendousforce . She whirled , bringing up the gun.  |p166Something  slammed into the door again , but the steel core and Schlage deadbolts could not be defeated easily . Then the nightmare began in earnest . A submachine gun chattered , hand Laura threw herself against the side of the refrigerator , sheltering there. , They were trying to blow open the back door , , hut the heavy steel core hed against that assault too . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall on both sides of the reinforced frame , tearing holes in the drywall . Family-room and kitchen windows exploded as a second submachine gun opened fire . The metal Levelors danced on their mountings . Metal slats twanged as slugs passed between them , and some slats bent , but most of the shattered window glass was contained behind the blinds , where it rained on sills and from there to the floor . Cabinet doors splintered and cracked as bullets pierced them , and chips of brick flew off one wall , and bullets ricochetedoff the copper range hood , leaving it dented , creased . Hanging from ceiling hooks , the copper pots and pans took a lot of hits , producing a variety of clinks and conks . One overhead light blew out . The Levelor at the window above the writing desk was torn off its mountings at last , and half a dozen slugs plowed into the refrigerator door just inches from her . Her heart was racing , and a flood of adrenaline had made her senses almost painfully sharp . She wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out before they realized she was in the process of leaving , but a primal warrior instinct told her to stay put . She pressed flat against the side of the refrigerator , out of the direct line of fire , hoping that she would not be hit by a ricochet . Who the hell are you people ? she wondered angrily . The firing stopped , and her instinct proved true : The barrage was followed by the gunmen themselves . They stormed the house . The first one clambered through the imploded window above the kitchen desk . She stepped away from the refrigerator and opened fire , blowing him back out onto the patio . A second man , dressed in black like the first , entered by the shattered sliding door in the family room  --  she saw him through the archway a second before he saw her  --  and she swung the Uzi in that direction , sprayingbullets , destroying the Mr. Coffee machine , tearing the hell out of the kitchen wall beside the archway , then cutting him down as he brought his weapon around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recently , and she was surprised at how controllable it was . She was also surprised at how sickened she was by the need to kill them , though they were trying to slaughter her and her child ; like a wave of oily sludge , nausea washed through her , but she choked down the gorge that rose in her throat . A third man started into the family room , and she was ready to kill him , too , and a hundred like him , no matter how sick the killing made her , but he threwp167himself backward , out of the line of fire , when he saw his companion blown away . Now the Jeep . She did n't know how many killers were outside , maybe only the three , two dead and one still living , maybe four or ten or a hundred , but regardless of how many there were , they would not have expected to be met with such a bold response and certainly not with so much firepower , no way , not from a woman and a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded and unarmed . So right now they were stunned , and they 'd be taking cover , assessing the situation , planning their next move . This might be her first and last chance to get away in the Jeep wagon . She sprinted through the laundry room into the garage . She saw that Chris had started the Jeep 's engine when he 'd heard the gunfire ; bluish exhaust fumes billowed from the tailpipes . As she ran to the Jeep , the garage door started up ; Chris had evidently used the Genie remotecontrolunit the moment he saw her . By the time she got behind the wheel , the garage door was a third open . She shifted into gear . " Get down ! " As Chris instantly obeyed , sliding down in his seat below window level , Laura let up on the brakes . She rammed the accelerator against the floorboards , peeled rubber on the concrete , and roared out into the night , clearing the still rising garage door by only an inch or two ; ripping off the radio antenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chains , had heavy winter tread . They dug into the frozen slush and gravel that formed the surface of the driveway , finding traction with no trouble , spewing shrapnel of stone and ice . From off to her left came a dark figure , a man in black , running across the front lawn , kicking up snow , forty or fifty feet away , and he was such a featureless shape that he might have been just a shadow , except that over the screaming of the engine she heard the rattle of automatic gunfire . Slugs slammed into the side of the Jeep , and the window behind her blew in , but the window beside her remained intact , and then she was speeding away , heading out of range , a few seconds from safety now , with wind shrieking at the broken window . She prayed none of the tires would be hit , and she heard more rounds striking sheet metal , or maybe it was gravel and ice churned up by the Jeep . When she reached the state route at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was out of range . As she braked hard for the left turn , she glanced into the rearview mirror and saw , far back , a pair of headlights at the open garage . The killers had arrived at her house without a vehicle  --  Godp168only knew how they had traveled , perhaps with the use of those strange belts  --  and they were using her Mercedes to pursue her . She had intended to turn left on the state route , head down past RunningSprings , past the turnoff to lake Arrowhead , on to the superhighway and into the city of San Bernardino , where there were people and safety in numbers , where men dressed in black and toting automatic weapons would not stalk her so boldly , and where she could get medical treatment for her guardian . But when she saw the headlights behind her , she responded to an innate proclivity for survival , turning right instead , heading east-northeast toward Big Bear Lake . If she had gone left they would have come to that fateful half mile of inclined highway on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura felt intuitively  --  almost superstitiously  --  that the most dangerous place in the world for them at the moment was that sloping length of two-lane blacktop . She and Chris had been meant to die twice on that hill : first , when the Robertsons ' pickup slid out of control ; second , when Kokoschka opened fire on them . Sometimes she perceived that there were both benign and ominous patterns in life and that , once thwarted , fate strove to reassert those predestineddesigns . Though she had no intellectually sound reason for believing that they would die if they headed down toward Running Springs , she knew in her heart that death in fact awaited them there . As they pulled onto the state route and headed for Big Bear , tall evergreensrising darkly on both sides , Chris sat up and looked back . " They 're coming , " Laura told him , " but we 'll outrun them . " " Are they the ones that got Daddy ? " " Yes , I think so . But we did n't know about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercedes was on the state route now , out of sight most of the time because the roadway rose and fell and twisted , putting hills and turns between the two vehicles . The car seemed to be about two hundred yards behind , but it was probably closing because it had a bigger engine and a lot more power than the Jeep . " Who are they ? " Chris asked . " I 'm not sure , honey . And I do n't know why they want to hurt us , either . But I know what they are . They 're thugs , they 're scum , I leained all about their type a long time ago at Caswell Hall , and I know the only thing you can do with people like them is stand up to them , fight back , because they only respect toughness . " " You were terrific back there , Mom . " " You were darned good yourself , kiddo . That was very smart of you to start the Jeep when you heard the gunfire , and to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got behind the wheel . That probably saved us. "  |p169Behind  them the Mercedes had closed the distance to about one hundredyards . It was a road-hugger , a 420 SEL , which handled as well as anything on the highway , much better than the Jeep . " They 're coming fast , Mom . " " I know . " " Real fast . " Approaching the eastern point of the lake , Laura pulled up behind a rattletrap Dodge pickup with one broken taillight and a rusted bumper that appeared to be held together by stickers with supposedly funny sayings  --  I BRAKE FOR BLONDES , MAFIA STAFF CAR . It chugged along at thirty miles an hour , below the speed limit . If Laura hesitated , the Mercedes would close the gap ; when they were near enough the killers might use their guns again . They were in a no-passing zone , but she could see enough clear road ahead to risk the maneuver ; she swung around the pickup , tramped the accelerator hard , got in front of the truck , and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about forty , and she passed that , too , just before the road got too twisty to allow the Mercedes to get around the old truck . " They 're hung up back there ! " Chris said . Laura put the Jeep up to fifty-five , which was too fast for some of the turns , though she held it on the road and began to think they were going to escape . But the highway split at the lake , and neither the Buick nor the old Ford pickup followed her along the south shore toward Big Bear City ; they both turned toward Fawnskin and the north shore , leaving the road empty between her and the Mercedes , which at once began to close the distance between them . Houses were everywhere now , both on the high ground to the right and on the lower ground down toward the lake on her left . Some of them were dark , probably vacation homes used only on winter weekends and in the summers , but the lights of other places were visible among the trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveways to a hundreddifferent houses where she and Chris would have been taken in . People would open their doors without hesitation . This was not the city ; in the small-town atmosphere of the mountains , people were not instantly suspicious of unannounced night visitors . The Mercedes closed to within a hundred yards , and the driver flicked the headlights from low beam to high beam again and again , as if gleefully saying , Hey , here we come , Laura , we 're gon na get you , we 're the boogeymen , the real thing , and nobody can run from us forever , here we come , here we come . If she tried to take refuge in one of the nearby houses , the killers probably would follow , murdering not only her and Chris but the people who sheltered them . The bastards might be reluctant to chase her to ground inp170the heart of San Bernardino or Riverside or even Redlands , where they were likely to encounter police response , but they would not be intimidated by a mere handful of bystanders because no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt elude capture by pushing the yellow buttons on their belts and vanishing as her guardian had vanished one year ago . She had no idea where they would be vanishing to , but she suspected that it was a place where the police could never touch them . She would not risk innocent lives , so she passed house after house without slowing . The Mercedes was about fifty yards back , closing fast . " Mom  --  " " I see them , honey . " She was headed toward Big Bear City , but unfortunately the place was inaptly named . It was not only less than a city but not even much of a village , hardly a hamlet . There were not enough streets for her to hope to lose their pursuers , and the police presence was inadequate to deal with a couple of fanatics armed with submachine guns . Light traffic passed them going the other way , and she got behind anothercar in their lane , a gray Volvo , around which she whipped on an almost blind stretch of road , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards . The killers passed the Volvo with equal recklessness . " How 's our passenger ? " she asked . Without unfastening his safety harness , Chris turned to look into the back of the Jeep wagon . " He looks okay , I guess . He 's getting bounced around a lot . " " I ca n't help that . " " Who is he , Mom ? " " I do n't know much about him , " she said . " But when we get out of this fix , I 'm going to tell you what I do know . I have n't told you before because . . . I guess because I did n't know what was going on , and I was afraid it might be dangerous somehow for you to know anything about him at all . But it ca n't get more dangerous than this , huh ? So I 'll tell you later . " Assuming there was going to be a later . When she was two-thirds of the way along the south shore of the lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mercedes just thirty-five yards behind , she saw the ridge-road turnoff ahead . It led up through the mountainspast Clark 's Summit , a ten-mile county road that cut off the thirty- or thirty-five-mile eastern loop of state route 38 , rejoining that two-lane highway south near Barton Flats . As she recalled , the ridge road was paved for a couple of miles at each end but was only a graded dirt lane for six or seven miles in the middle . Unlike the Jeep , the Mercedes did not have four-wheel drive ; it had winter tires , but they were not currently equipped with chains . The men driving the Mercedes were unlikely to know that the ridge road'sp171pavement would give way to a rutted dirt surface patched with ice and in some places drifted over with snow . " Hold on ! " she told Chris . She did n't use the brakes until the last moment , taking the right turn onto the ridge road so fast that the Jeep slid sideways with a tortured squeal of tires . It shuddered , too , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a frightening jump . The Mercedes cornered better , though the driver had not known what she was going to do . As they headed into higher elevations and greater wilderness , the car closed the gap to about thirty yards . Twenty-five . Twenty . Thorny branches of lightning abruptly grew across the sky to the south . I t was not as near to them as the lightning at the house but near enough to turn night to day around them . Even above the sound of the engine she could hear the roar of thunder . Gaping at the stormy display , Chris said , " Mommy , what 's going on ? What 's happening ? " " I do n't know , " she said , and she had to shout to be heard above the cacophony of the racing engine and clashing heavens . She did not hear the gunfire itself but heard bullets smacking into the Jeep , and a slug punched a hole through the tailgate window and thudded into the back of the seat in which she and Chris were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact . She began to turn the wheel back and forth , weavingfrom one side of the road to the other , making as difficult a target as possible , which made her dizzy in the flickering light . Either the gunman stopped firing or missed them with every shot , because she did not hear any more incoming rounds . However , the weaving slowed her , and the Mercedes closed even faster . She had to use the side mirrors instead of the rearview . Though most of the tailgate window was intact , the safety glass was webbed with thousands of tiny cracks that left it translucent and useless . Fifteen yards , ten . In the southern sky the lightning and thunder passed , as before . She topped a rise , and the pavement ended halfway down the hill ahead of them . She stopped weaving , accelerated . When the Jeep left the blacktop , it shimmied for a moment , as if surprised by the change in road surface , but then streaked forward on the snow-spotted , ice-crusted , frozen dirt . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow where trees arched over them , and up the next hill . In the side mirrors she saw the Mercedes cross the hollow on the dirt lane and start up the slope behind her . But as she reached the crest , the car began to founder in her wake . It slid sideways , its headlights swinging awayp172from her . The driver overcorrected instead of turning the wheel into the slide , as he should have done . The car 's tires began to spin uselessly . It slid not only off to the side but backward twenty yards , until the right rear wheel jolted into the drainage ditch that flanked the road ; the headlight beams were canted up and angled across the dirt track . " They 're stuck ! " Chris said . " They 'll need half an hour to get out of that mess . " Laura continued over the crest , down the next slope of the dark ridge road . Although she should have been exultant over their escape , or at least relieved , her fear was undiminished . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had learned to trust her hunches more than twenty years ago , when she had suspected the White Eel was going to come for her the night that she would have been alone in the end room by the stairs at Mcllroy , the night when in fact he had left a Tootsie Roll under her pillow . After all , hunches were just messages from the subconscious , which was thinking furiouslyall the time and processing information she had not consciously noted . Something was wrong . But what ? They made less than twenty miles an hour on that narrow , winding , potholed , rutted , frozen dirt track . For a while the road followed the rocky spine of a ridge where there were no trees , then traced the course of a declivity in the ridge wall , all the way to the floor of the parallel ravine , where trees were so thick on both sides that the headlights bouncing back from their trunks seemed to reveal phalanxes of pines as solid as board walls . In the back of the wagon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worried about him , and she wished that she could go faster , but she dared not . For the first two miles after they lost their pursuers , Chris was silent . Finally he said , " At the house . . . did you kill any of them ? " She hesitated . " Yes . Two . " " Good . " Disturbed by the grim pleasure in the single word that he spoke , Laura said , " No , Chris , it is n't good to kill . It made me sick . " " But they deserved to be killed , " he said . " Yes , they did . But that does n't mean it 's pleasant to kill them . It 's not . There 's no satisfaction in it . Just . . . disgust at the necessity of it . And sadness . " " I wish I could 've killed one of them , " he said with tight , cold anger that was disturbing in a boy his age . She glanced at him . With his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashboard , he looked older than he was , and she had a glimpse of the man he would become . When the ravine floor became too rocky to provide passage , the road rose again , following a shelf on the ridge wall . She kept her eyes on the rude track . " Honey , we 'll have to talk about this later at more length . Right now I just want you to listen carefully and try to understand something . There are a lot of bad philosophies in the world . You know what a philosophy is ? " " Sorta . No . . . not really . " " Then let 's just say people believe in a lot of things that are bad for them to believe . But there are two things that different kinds of people believe that are the worst , most dangerous , wrongest of all . Some people believe the best way to solve a problem is with violence ; they beat up or kill anyone who disagrees with them . " " Like these guys who 're after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of people they are . That 's a real bad way of thinking because violence leads to more violence . Besides , if you settle differences with a gun , there 's no justice , no moment of peace , no hope . You follow me ? " " I guess so . But what 's the other worst kind of bad thinking ? " " Pacifism , " she said . " That 's just the opposite of the first kind of bad thinking . Pacifists believe you should never lift a hand against another human being , no matter what he has done or what you know he 's going to do . If a pacifist was standing beside his brother , and if he saw a man coming to kill his brother , he 'd urge his brother to run , but he would n't pick up a gun and stop the killer . " " He 'd let the guy go after his brother ? " Chris asked , astonished . " Yes . If worse came to worst , he 'd let his brother be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killer himself . " " That 's whacko . " They rounded the point of the ridge , and the road descended into another valley . The branches of overhanging pines were so low they scraped the roof ; clumps of snow fell onto the hood and windshield . Laura turned on the wipers and hunched over the steering wheel , using the change in terrain as an excuse not to talk until she had time to think how to make her point most clearly . They had endured a lot of violence in the past hour ; much more violence no doubt lay ahead of them , and she was concerned that Chris develop a proper attitude toward it . She did not want him to get the idea that guns and muscle were acceptable substitutes for reason . On the other hand she did not want him to be traumatized by violence and learn to fear it at the cost of personal dignity and ultimate survival.  |p174At  last she said , " Some pacifists are cowards in disguise , but some really believe it 's right to permit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They 're wrong because by not fighting evil , they 've become part of it . They 're as bad as the guy who pulls the trigger . Maybe this is above your head right now , and maybe you 'll have to do a lot of thinking before you understand , but it 's important you realize there 's a way to live that 's in the middle , between killers and pacifists . You try to avoid violence . You never start it . But if someone else starts it , you defend yourself , friends , family , anyone who 's in trouble . When I had to shoot those men at the house , it made me sick . I 'm no hero . I 'm not proud of having shot them , but I 'm not ashamed of it , either . I do n't want you to be proud of me for it , or think that killing them was satisfying , that revenge in any way makes me feel better about your dad 's murder . It does n't . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much on you ? " " No . I just got ta think about it a while , " he said . " Right now , I 'm thinking bad , I guess . ' Cause I want them all dead , all of them who had anything to do with . . . what happened to Dad . But I 'll work on it , Mom . I 'll try to be a better person . " She smiled . " I know you will , Chris . " During her conversation with Chris and for the few minutes of mutual silence that followed it , Laura continued to be plagued by the feeling that they were not yet out of imminent danger . They had gone about seven miles on the ridge road , with perhaps another mile of dirt track and two miles of pavement ahead before they connected with state route 38 . The farther she drove , the more certain she became that she was overlooking something and that more trouble was drawing near . She suddenly stopped on the spine of another ridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time  --  toward lower land . She switched off the engine and the lights . " What 's wrong ? " Chris asked . " Nothing . I just need to think , have a look at our passenger . " She got out and went around to the back of the Jeep . She opened the tailgate , where a bullet had punched through the window . Chunks of safety glass broke out and fell on the ground at her feet . She climbed into the cargo bed and , lying next to her guardian , checked the wounded man 's pulse . It was still weak , perhaps even slightly weaker than before , but it was regular . She put a hand to his head and found he was no longer cold ; he seemed to be afire within . At her request Chris gave her the flashlight from the glove compartment . She pulled back the blankets to see if the man was bleedingp175worse than when they had loaded him into the Jeep . His wound looked bad , hut there was not much fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She replaced the blankets , returned the flashlight to Chris , got out of the Jeep , and closed the tailgate . She broke all of the remaining glass out of the tailgate window and out of the smaller rear window on the driver 's side . With the glass missing completely , the damage was less conspicuous and less likely to draw the attention of a cop or anyone else . For a while she stood in the cold air beside the wagon , staring out at the lightless wilderness , trying to force a connection between instinct and reason : Why was she so sure that she was heading for trouble and that the night 's violence was not yet at an end ? The clouds were shredding in a high-altitude wind that harried them eastward , a wind that had not yet reached the ground , where the air was almost peculiarly still . Moonlight found its way through those ragged holes and eerily illuminated the snow-cloaked landscape of rising and falling hills , evergreens leeched of their color by the night , and clustered rock formations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge road led to state route 38 , and everything in that direction seemed serene . She looked east , west , then back to the north from which they had come , and on all sides the San Bernardino Mountains were without a sign of human habitation , without a single light , and seemed to exist in primeval purity and peace . She asked herself the same questions and gave the same answers that had been part of an interior dialogue for the past year . Where did the men with the belts come from ? Another planet , another galaxy ? No . They were as human as she was . So maybe they came from Russia . Maybe the belts acted like matter transmitters , devices akin to the teleportation chamber in that old movie , The Fly . That might explain her guardian 's accent  --  if he 'd teleported from Russia  --  but it did n't explain why he had not aged in a quarter of a century ; besides , she did not seriously believe that the Soviet Union or anyone else had been perfecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left time travel . She had been considering that possibility for some months , though she 'd not even felt confident enough about her analysis to mention it to Thelma . But if her guardian had been entering her life at crucial points by time travel , he could have made all of his journeys in the space of a single month or week in his own era while many years had passed for her , so he would have appeared not to have aged . Until she could question him and learn the truth , the time-travel theory was the only one on which she could operate : Her guardian had traveled to her from some future world ; and evidentlyit was an unpleasant future , because when speaking of the belt he had said , " You do n't want to go where it 'll take you , " and there had been a bleak ,  |p176haunted  look in his eyes . She had no idea why a time traveler would come back from the future to protect her , of all people , from armed junkies and runaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibilities . The night was quiet , dark , and cold . They were heading straight into trouble . She knew it , but she did n't know what it was or where it would come from . When she got back into the jeep , Chris said , " What 's wrong now ? " " You 're crazy about Star Trek , Star Wars , Batteries Not Included , all that stuff , so maybe what I 've got here is the kind of background expert I seek out when I 'm writing a novel . You 're my resident expert in the weird . " The engine was switched off , and the interior of the Jeep was brightenedonly by the cloud-cloaked moonlight . But she was able to see Chris 's face reasonably well because , during the few minutes she had been outside , her eyes had adapted to the night . He blinked at her and looked puzzled . " What 're you talking about ? " " Chris , like I said earlier , I 'm going to tell you all about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's made in my life , but we do n't have time for that now . So do n't snow me under with lots of questions , okay ? But just suppose my guardian  --  that 's how I think of him , because he 's protected me front terrible things when he could  --  suppose he was a time traveler from the future . Suppose he does n't come in a big clumsy time machine . Suppose the whole machine is in a belt that he wears around his waist , under his clothes , and he just materializes out of thin air when he arrives here from the future . Are you with me so far ? " Chris was staring wide-eyed . " Is that what he is ? " " He might be , yes . " The boy freed himself from his safety harness , scrambled onto his knees on the seat , and looked back at the man lying in the compartment behind them . " Holy shit . " " Given the unusual circumstances , " she said , " I 'll overlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sorry . But a time traveler ! " If she had been angry with him , the anger would not have held , for she now saw in him a sudden rush of that boyish excitement and a capacity for wonder that he had not exhibited in a year , not even at Christmas when he had enjoyed himself immensely with Jason Gaines . The prospect of an encounter with a time traveler instantly filled him with a sense of adventure and joy . That was the splendid thing about life : Though it was cruel , it was also mysterious , filled with wonder and surprise ; sometimes the surprises were so amazing that they qualified as miraculous , and by witnessing those miracles , a despondent , person could discover a reason to live , a cynic could obtain unex/pected relief from ennui , and a profoundly wounded boy could find the will to heal himself and medicine for melancholy . She said , " Okay , suppose that when he wants to leave our time and return to his own , he presses a button on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belt ? " " Later . Remember , you promised not to ask a lot of questions just now . " " Okay . " He looked again at the guardian , then turned and sat down , focusing his attention on his mother . " When he presses the button  --  what happens ? " " He just vanishes . " " Wow ! And when he arrives from the future , does he just appear out of thin air ? " " I do n't know . I 've never seen him arrive . Though I think for some reason there 's lightning and thunder  --  " " The lightning tonight ! " " Yes , but there 's not always lightning . All right . Suppose that he came back in time to help us , to protect us from certain dangers  --  " " Like the runaway pickup . " " We do n't know why he wants to protect us , ca n't know why until he tells us . Anyway , suppose other people from the future do n't want us to be protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But one of them was Kokoschka , the man who shot your father  --  " " And the guys who showed up tonight at the house , " Chris said , " they 're from the future , too . " " I think so . They were planning to kill my guardian , you , and me . But we killed some of them instead and left two of them stranded in the Mercedes . So . . . what are they going to do next , kiddo ? You 're the resident expert on the weird . Do you have any ideas ? " I " Let me think . " Moonlight gleamed dully on the dirty hood of the Jeep . The interior of the station wagon was growing cold ; their breath issued in frosty plumes , and the windows were beginning to fog over . Laura switched on the engine , heater , defroster , but not the lightsChris said , " Well , see , their mission failed , so they wo n't hang around . They 'll go back to the future where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car ? " " Yeah . They probably already pushed the buttons on the belts of the guys you killed , sent the bodies back to the future , so there 're no dead men at the house , no proof time travelers were ever there . Except maybe some blood . So when the last two or three guys got stuck in the ditch , they probablygave up and went home . "  | " So they are n't back there any more ? They would n't walk back to Big Bear maybe , steal a car , and try to find us ? " " Nope . That would be too hard . I mean , they have an easier way to find us than to just drive around looking for us like regular bad guys would have to do . " " What way ? " The boy screwed up his face and squinted through the windshield at the snow and moonglow and darkness ahead . " See , Mom , as soon as they lost us , they 'd push the buttons on their belts , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip back to our time to set another trap for us . They knew we took this road . So what they probably did was make another trip back to our time , but earlier tonight , and they set a trap at the other end of this road , and now they 're waiting there for us . Yeah , that 's where they are ! I 'll just bet that 's where they are . " " But why could n't they come back even earlier tonight , earlier than they came the first time , back to the house , and attack us before my guardian ever showed up to warn us ? " " Paradox , " the boy said . " You know what that means ? " The word seemed too complex for a boy his age , but she said , " Yes , I know what a paradox is . Anything that 's self-contradictory but possibly true . " " See , Mom , the neat thing is that time travel is full of all kinds of possible paradoxes . Things that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then might be . " Now he was talking in that excited voice with which he described scenes in his favorite fantastic films and comic books , but with more intensity than she had ever heard before , probably because this was not a story but reality even more amazing than fiction . " Like suppose you went back in time and married your own grandfather . See , then you 'd be your own grandmother . If time travel was possible , maybe you could do that  --  but then how could you have ever been born if your real grandmother had never married your grandfather in the first place ? Paradox ! Or what if you went back in time and met up with your mom when she was a kid and accidentally killed her ? Would you just cease to exist  --  pop !  --  like you 'd never been born ? But if you ceased to exist  --  then how could you have gone back in time in the first place ? Paradox ! Paradox ! " Staring at him in the moon-painted darkness of the Jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different boy from the one she had always known . Of course , she had been aware of his great fascination with space-age tales , which seemed to preoccupy most kids these days , regardless of age . But until now she had n't gotten a deep look inside the mind shaped by those influences . Evidently the American children of the late twentieth century not only lived interior fantasy lives richer than those of children at any other time in history , but they seemed to have gotten from their fantasies something notp179provided by the elves and fairies and ghosts with which earlier generations of kids had entertained themselves : the ability to think about abstract concepts like space and time in a manner far beyond their intellectual and emotional age . She had the peculiar feeling that she was speaking to a little boy and a rocket scientist coexisting in one body . Disconcerted , she said , " So . . . when these men failed to kill us on their first trip tonight , why would n't they make a second trip earlier than the first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming ? " " See , your guardian already showed up in the time stream to warn us . So if they came back before he warned us  --  then how could he have warned us in the first place , and how could we be here where we are now , alive ? Para-dox ! " He laughed and clapped his hands like a gnome chortling over some particularly amusing side-effect of a magical spell . In contrast to his good humor , Laura was getting a headache from trying to sort out the complexities of this thing . Chris said , " Some people believe time travel is n't even possible ' cause of all the paradoxes . But some believe it 's possible so long as the trip you make into the past does n't create a paradox . Now if that 's true , see , then the killers could n't come back on a second , earlier trip ' cause two of them had already been killed on the first trip . They could n't do it because they were already dead , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill and maybe some new time travelers could make another trip to cut us off at the end of this road . " He leaned forward to peer through the streaked windshield again . " That 's what all that lightning was off to the south when we were weaving to keep them from shooting us  --  more guys from the future were arriving . Yeah , I 'll bet they 're waiting for us down there somewhere , down there in the dark . " Rubbing her temples with her fingertips , Laura said , " But if we turn around and go back , if we do n't drive into the trap ahead , then they 'll realize we 've outthought them . And so they 'll make a third trip back in time and return to the Mercedes and shoot us when we try to drive back that way . They 'll get us no matter which way we go . " He shook his head vigorously . " No . Because by the time they realize we 're on to them , maybe half an hour from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back past the Mercedes . " The boy was bouncing up and down in his seat with excitement now . " So if they try to make a third trip in time to go back to the beginning of this road and trap us there , they ca n't do it , because we 'll already have driven back that way and out , we 'll already be safe . Paradox ! See , they got to play by the rules , Mom . They 're not magical . They got to play by the rules , and they can be beat ! " In thirty-three years she had never had a headache that had gone from a mild throb to a pounding skull-splitter as quickly as this one . The more shep180tried to puzzle out the difficulties of avoiding a pack of time-traveling hitmen , the deeper rooted the pain became . Finally she said , " I give up . I guess I should 've been watching Star Trek and reading Robert Heinlein all these years instead of being a serious adult , because I 'm just not able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what : I 'm going to rely on you to outsmart them . You 'll have to try to keep one step ahead of them . They want us dead . So how can they try to kill us without creating one of these paradoxes ? Where will they show up next . . . and next ? Right now , we 're going to go back the way we came , past the Mercedes , and if you 're right , no one will be waiting there for us . So where will they show up after that ? Will we see them again tonight ? Think about those things , and when you have any ideas , let me know what they are . " " I will , Mom . " He slumped down in his seat , grinning broadly for a moment , then chewing on his lip as he settled deeper into the game . Except it was not a game , of course . Their lives were really at stake . They had to elude killers with nearly superhuman abilities , and they were pinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eight-year-old boy 's imagination . Laura started the Jeep , put it in reverse , and backed up a couple of hundred yards until she found a place in the road wide enough to turn around . Then they headed back the way they had come , toward the Mercedesin the ditch , toward Big Bear . She was beyond terror . Their situation contained such a large element of the unknown  --  and unknowable  --  that terror could not be sustained . Terror was not like happiness or depression ; it was an acute condition that by its very nature had to be of a short term . Terror wilted fast . Or it escalated until you passed out or until you died of it , frightened to death ; you screamed until a blood vessel burst in your brain . She was n't screaming , and in spite of her headache she did n't think any vessels were going to burst . She settled into a low-key , chronic fear , hardly more than anxiety . What a day this had been . What a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranded Mercedes and drove all the way to the north end of the ridge road without encountering men with submachine guns . At the intersection with the lakeside highway , Laura stopped and looked at Chris . " Well ? " " As long as we 're driving around , " he said , " and as long as we go to a place where we 've never been and do n't usually go , we 're pretty safe . Theyp181ca n't find us if they do n't have any idea where we might be . Just like your regular-type scumbags . " Scumbags ? she thought . What is this  --  H. G. Wells meets Hill Street Blues ? He said , " See , now that we 've given them the slip , these guys are going to go back to the future and look over the records they 've got about you , Mom , your history , and they 're going to see where you show up next  --  like when you want to go live in the house again . Or if you hid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a tour for it , they 'd show up at a store where you 're signing books because , see , there 'd be a record of that in the future ; they 'd know you could be found in that store at a certain time on a certain day . " She frowned . " You mean the only way to avoid them for the rest of my life is to change my name , go on the run forever , and leave no trace of myself on any public records , just vanish from recorded history from here on out ? " " Yeah , I think maybe that 's what you 'll have to do , " he said excitedly . He was smart enough to have figured out how to defeat a pack of timetravelinghitmen but not adult enough to perceive how hard it would be for them to forsake everything they owned and start with only the cash in their pockets . In a way he was like an idiot savant , tremendously insightful and gifted in one narrow area , but naive and severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , he was a thousand years old , but otherwise he was going on nine . She said , " I can never write another book because I 'd have to have contact with editors , agents , even if by phone . So there 'd be phone records that could be traced . And I ca n't collect royalties because no matter how many blinds I use , no matter how many different bank accounts I shift the money through , sooner or later I have to collect the funds personally , which would leave a public record . So then they 'd have that record in the future , and they 'd travel back to the bank to wipe me out when I showed up . ) How am I supposed to get my hands on the money we already have ? How can I cash a check anywhere without leaving a record that they would have in the future ? " She blinked at him . " Good God , Chris , we 're in a box ! " Now it was the boy 's turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of where money came from , how it was put aside for future use , or how difficult it was to obtain . " Well , for a couple of days , we can just drive around , sleep in motels  --  " " We can only sleep in motels if I pay cash . A credit card record might be all they need to find us . Then they 'd come back in time to the night I used the credit card , and they 'd kill us at the motel . " " Yeah , so we use cash . Hey , we can eat at McDonald 's all the time ! That does n't take much money , and it 's good . "  |p182They  drove down from the mountains , out of the snow , into San Bernardino , a city of about 300,000 , without encountering assassins . She needed to get their guardian to a doctor , not only because she owed him a debt of life , but also because without him she might never learn the truth of what was happening and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . She could not take him to a hospital because hospitals kept records , which might give her enemies from the future a way of finding her . She would have to obtain medical care secretly , from someone who would not have to be told her name or anything about the patient . Shortly before midnight she stopped at a telephone booth near a Shell service station . The phone was at the corner of the property , away from the station itself , which was ideal because she could not risk an attendant noticingthe Jeep 's broken windows or the unconscious man . In spite of the hour-long nap the boy had gotten earlier and in spite of the excitement , Chris had dozed off . In the compartment behind the front seat , their guardian was sleeping , too , but his sleep was neither restful nor natural . He was not mumbling much any more , but for minutes at a stretch he drew breath with a dismaying wheeze and rattle . She left the Jeep in park , the engine running , and went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the Yellow Pages ' listings for physicians . After obtaining a street map of San Bernardino from the attendant in the service station , she began searching for a doctor who did not operate out of a clinic or medical office building but from an office attached to his home , which was how most doctors in small towns and cities had worked in years gone by , though these days few continued to keep home and office together . She was acutely aware that the longer she took to find help , the smaller the chance that their guardian would survive . At a quarter past one , in a quiet residential neighborhood of older homes , she pulled in front of a two-story , white , Victorian house built in another era , in a lost California , before everything had been constructed of stucco . It stood on a corner lot , with a two-car garage , shaded by alders that were leafless in the middle of winter , a touch that made it seem like a place transported entirely , landscaping and all , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone directory , this was the address for Dr. Carter Brenkshaw , and beside the driveway a small sign suspended between two wrought-iron posts confirmed the directory 's accuracy . She drove to the end of the block and parked at the curb . She got out of the Jeep , scooped a handful of damp earth from a flowerbed in front of ap183nearby house , and smeared the dirt over the front and back license plates as best she could . By the time she wiped her hand in the grass and got back in the Jeep , Chris had awakened but was groggy and confused after being asleep for more than two hours . She patted his face and pushed his hair back from his forehead and rapidly talked him awake . The cold night air , flowing through the broken windows , helped too . " Okay , " she said when she was sure he was awake , " listen closely , partner . I 've found a doctor . Can you act sick ? " " Sure . " He made a face as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't overplay it . " She explained what they were going to do . " Good plan , Mom . " " No , it 's nuts . But it 's the only plan I 've got . " She swung the car around and drove back to Brenkshaw 's , where she parked in the driveway in front of the closed garage , which was set back from the house . Chris slid out by the driver 's door , and she picked him up and held him against her left side , his head against her shoulder . He held on to her , so she only needed her left arm to keep him in place , though he was quite heavy ; her baby was not a baby any more . In her free hand she gripped the revolver . As she carried Chris along the walk , past the stark alders , with no light except a purplish glow from one of the widely spaced mercury-vapor streetlampsout at the curb , she hoped no one was at a window in any of the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual for someone to visit a doctor 's house in the middle of the night , needing treatment . She went up the front steps , across the porch , and rang the bell three times , quick , as a frantic mother might do . She waited only a few seconds before ringing it three more times . In a couple of minutes , after she had rung the bell again and was beginning to think that no one was home , the porch lights came on . She saw a man studying her through the three-pane , fan-shaped window in the top third of the door . " Please , " she said urgently , holding the revolver at her side where it could not be seen , " my boy , poison , he 's swallowed poison ! " The man opened the door inward , and there was an outward-opening glass storm door , as well , so Laura stepped out of its way . He was about sixty-five , white-haired , with a face that was Irish except for a strong Roman nose and dark brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pajamas , and slippers . Peering at her over the rims of tortoiseshell glasses , he said , " What 's wrong ? " " I live two blocks down , you 're so close , and my boy  --  poison . " At thep184height of her hysteria , she let go of Chris , and he got out of her way as she shoved the muzzle of the .38 against the man 's belly . " I 'll blow your guts out if you call for help . " She had no intention of shooting him , but she apparently sounded convincing , for he nodded and said nothing . " Are you Dr. Brenkshaw ? " He nodded again , and she said , " Who else is in the house , Doctor ? " " No one . I 'm alone here . " " Your wife ? " " I 'm a widower . " " Children ? " " All grown and gone . " " Do n't lie to me . " " I 've made a lifetime habit of not lying , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times , but telling the truth generally makes life simpler . Look , it 's chilly , and this robe 's thin . You can intimidate me as well if you come inside . " She stepped across the threshold , keeping the gun in his belly and pushinghim backward with it . Chris followed her . " Honey , " she whispered , " go check out the house . Quietly . Start upstairs , and do n't miss a room . If there 's anyone here , tell them the doctor has an emergency patient and needs their help . " Chris headed for the stairs , and Laura kept Carter Brenkshaw in thefoyer at gunpoint . Nearby a grandfather clock was ticking softly . " You know , " he said , " I 've been a lifelong reader of thrillers . " She frowned . " What do you mean ? " " Well , I 've often read a scene in which a gorgeous villainness held the hero against his will . As often as not , when he finally turned the tables on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they made wild , passionate love . So when it happens to me , why do I have to be too old to enjoy the prospect of the second half of this little showdown ? " Laura held back a smile because she could not continue to pretend to be dangerous once she allowed herself to smile . " Shut up . " " Surely you can do better than that . " " Just shut up , all right ? Shut up . " He did not go pale or begin to tremble . He smiled . Chris returned from upstairs . " Nobody , Mom . " Brenkshaw said , " I wonder how many dangerous thugs have pint-size accomplices who call them Mom ? " " Do n't misjudge me , Doctor . I 'm desperate . " Chris disappeared into the downstairs rooms , turning on lights as he went.  |p185To  Brenkshaw , Laura said , " I 've got a wounded man in the car  --  " " Of course , a gunshot. " "  --  I want you to treat him and keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , we 'll come back some night and blow you away . " " This , " he said almost merrily , " is perfectly delicious . " As Chris returned , he switched off the lights he had switched on momentsago . " Nobody , Mom . " " You have a stretcher ? " Laura asked the physician . Brenkshaw stared at her . " You really do have a wounded man ? " " What the hell else would I be doing here ? " " How peculiar . Well , all right , how badly is he bleeding ? " " A lot earlier , not so much now . But he 's unconscious . " " If he 's not bleeding badly now , we can roll him in . I 've got a collapsible wheelchair in my office . an I get an overcoat , " he said , pointing to the foyer closet , " or do tough molls like you get a thrill out of making old men shiver in their peejays ? " " Get your coat , Doctor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , " Chris said . " She shot two guys already tonight . " He imitated the sound of an Uzi . " She just cut ' em down , and they never had a chance to lay a hand on her . " The boy sounded so sincere that Brenkshaw looked at Laura with new concern . " There 's nothing but coats in the closet . Umbrellas . A pair of galoshes . I do n't keep a gun in there . " " Just be careful , Doctor . No fast moves . " " No fast moves  --  yes , I knew you 'd say that . " Though he still seemed to find the situation to some degree amusing , he was not quite as lighthearted about it as he had been . When he had pulled on his overcoat , they went with him through a door to the left of the foyer . Without snapping on a light , relying on the glow from the foyer and on his familiarity with the place , Dr. Brenkshaw led them through a patients ' waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables . Another door led into his office  --  a desk , three chairs , medical books  --  where he did turn on a light , and a door from the office led farther back in the house to his examination room . Laura had expected to see an examination table and equipment that had been in use and well maintained for thirty-odd years , a homely den of medicinestraight out of a Norman Rockwell painting , but everything looked new . There was even an EKG machine , and at the far end of the room was a doorwith a sign that warned X-RAY : KEEP CLOSED IN USE . " You have X-ray equipment here ? " she asked . " Sure . It 's not as expensive as it once was . Every clinic has X-ray equipmentthese days . "  | " Every clinic , yes , but this is just a one-man  --  " " I may look like Barry Fitzgerald playing at being a doctor in an old movie , and I may prefer the old-fashioned convenience of an office in my home , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dare say , I 'm a more serious physician than you are a desperado . " " Do n't bet on that , " she said harshly , though she was getting tired of pretending to be cold-blooded . " Do n't worry , " he said . " I 'll play along . Seems like it 'll be more fun if I do . " To Chris , he said , " When we came through my office , did you notice a big , red-ceramic jar on the desk ? It 's full of orange-slice candies and Tootsie Pops if you want some . " " Wow , thanks ! " Chris said . " Uh . . . can I have a piece , Mom ? " " A piece or two , " she said , " but do n't make yourself sick . " Brenkshaw said , " When it comes to giving sweet treats to young patients , I 'm old-fashioned , I guess . No sugar-free gum here . What the hell fun is that stuff ? Tastes like plastic . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's their dentist 's problem . " While he talked , he got a folding wheelchair from the corner , unfolded it , and rolled it to the middle of the room . Laura said , " Honey , you stay here while we go out to the Jeep . " " Okay , " Chris said from the next room , where he was peering into the red-ceramic jar , selecting his treat . " Your Jeep in the driveway ? " Brenkshaw asked . " Then let 's go out the back . Less conspicuous , I think . " Pointing the revolver at the physician but feeling foolish , Laura followed him out of a side door in the examination room , which opened onto a ramp , so there was no need to descend stairs . " Handicapped entrance , " Brenkshaw said quietly over his shoulder as he pushed the wheelchair along a walk toward the back of the house . His bedroomslippers made a crisp sound on the concrete . The physician had a large property , so the neighboring house did not loom over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front lawn , the side yard was graced with ficus and pines , which were green all year . In spite of the screening branches and the darkness , however , Laura could see the blank windows of the neighboring place , so she supposed that she could be seen , as well , if anyone looked . The world had the hushed quality that it possessed only between midnight and dawn . Even if she had not known it was going on two in the morning , she would have been able to guess the time within half an hour . Though faint city noises echoed in the distance , there was a cemeterial stillness that would have made her feel like a woman on a secret mission even if she had only been taking out the garbage.  |p187The  walk led around the house , crossing another walk that extended to the back of the property . They went past the rear porch , through an areaway between house and garage , into the driveway . Brenkshaw halted at the back of the Jeep and chuckled . " Mud on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . " After she put the tailgate down , he got into the back of the Jeep to have a look at the wounded man . She looked out toward the street . All was silent . Still . But if a San Bernardino Police cruiser happened to drive by now on a routine patrol , the officer would surely stop to see what was up at kindly old Doc Brenkshaw 's place . . . . Brenkshaw was already crawling out of the Jeep . " By God , you do have a wounded man in there . " " Why the hell do you keep being surprised ? Would I pull this kind of stunt for laughs ? " " Let 's get him inside . Quickly , " Brenkshaw said . He could not handle her guardian by himself . In order to help him , Laura had to stick the .38 in the waistband of her jeans . Brenkshaw made no attempt to run or to knock her down and get the weapon away from her . Instead , as soon as he had the wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive , through the areaway , and around the house to the handicapped entrance at the far side . She grabbed one of the Uzis from the front seat and followed Brenkshaw . She did n't think she 'd have any use for the automatic carbine , but she felt better with it in her hands . Fifteen minutes later , Brenkshaw turned from the developed X-rays that hung on a lightboard in a corner of his examination room . " The bullet did n't fragment , made a clean exit . Did n't nick any bones , so we do n't have chips to worry about . " " Terrific , " Chris said from a corner chair , happily sucking on a Tootsie Pop . In spite of the warm air in the house , Chris was still wearing his jacket , as was Laura , because she wanted them to be ready to get out on short notice . " Is he in a coma or what ? " Laura asked the doctor . " Yes , he 's comatose . Not from any fever associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . And now that he 's gotten treatment , there probably wo n't be an infection . It 's traumatic coma from being shot , the loss of blood , the shock and all . He should n't have been moved , you know . " " I had no choice . Will he come out of it ? " " Probably . In this case a coma is the body 's way of shutting down top188conserve energy , facilitate healing . He 's not lost as much blood as it appears ; he 's got a good pulse , so this probably wo n't last long . When you see his shirt and lab coat soaked like that , you think he 's bled quarts , but he has n't . Not that it was a spoonful , either . He 's had a bad time of it . But no major blood vessels were torn , or he 'd be in worse shape . Still , he should be in a hospital . " " We 've already been through that , " Laura said impatiently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What bank did you rob ? " the physician asked teasingly , but with noticeablyless twinkle in his eyes than there had been when he had made his other little jokes . While he waited for the pictures to develop , he had cleaned the wound , flooded it with iodine , dusted it with antibiotic powder , and prepared a bandage . Now he got a needle , another implement she could not identify , and heavy thread from a cabinet and put them on a stainless-steel tray that he had hung on the side of the examination table . The wounded man lay there , unconscious , propped on his right side with the help of several foam pillows . " What 're you doing ? " Laura asked . " Those holes are fairly large , especially the exit wound . If you insist on endangering his life by keeping him out of a hospital , then the least I can do is throw a few stitches in him . " " Well , all right , but be quick about it . " " You expect G-men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worse than that , " she said . " Far worse than that . " Since they had arrived at Brenkshaw 's , she had been expecting a sudden , night-shattering display of lightning , thunder like the giant hooves of apocalyptichorsemen , and the arrival of more well-armed time travelers . Fifteen minutes ago , as the doctor had been X-raying her guardian 's chest , she 'd thought she heard thunder so distant that it was barely audible : . She hurried to the nearest window to search the sky for far-off lightning , but she saw none through the breaks in the trees , perhaps because the sky over San Bernardino already had a ruddy glow from city lights or perhaps because she had not heard thunder in the first place . She had finally decided that she might have heard a jet passing overhead and , in her panic , had misinterpretedit as a more distant sound . Brenkshaw stitched up his patient , snipped the thread  --  " sutures will dissolve "  --  and bound the bandages in place with wide adhesive tape that he repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air had a pungent , medicinal smell that made Laura slightly ill , but it did not bother Chris . He sat in the corner , happily working on another Tootsie Pop . While waiting for the X-rays , Brenkshaw also had administered an injec/tion of penicillin . Now he went to the tall , white , metal cabinets along the far wall and poured capsules from a large jar into a pill bottle , then from another large jar into a second small bottle . " I keep some basic drugs here , sell them to poorer patients at cost so they do n't have to go broke at the pharmacy . " " What 're these ? " Laura asked when he returned to the examination table , where she stood , and gave her the two small plastic bottles . " More penicillin in this one . Three a day , with meals  --  if he can take meals . I think he 'll come around soon . If he does n't he 'll begin to dehydrate , and he 'll need intravenous fluid . Ca n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he 'd choke . This other is a painkiller . Only when needed , and no more than two a day . " " Give me more of these . In fact give me your whole supply . " She pointed to two quart jars that contained hundreds of both capsules . " He wo n't need that much of either one . He  --  " " No , I 'm sure he wo n't , " she said , " but I do n't know what the hell other problems we 're going to have . We may need both penicillin and painkillers for me  --  or my boy . " Brenkshaw stared at her for a long moment . " What in the name of God have you gotten into ? It 's like something in one of your books . " " Just give me  --  " Laura stopped , stunned by what he had said . " Like something in one of my books ? In one of my books ! Oh , my God , you know who I am . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on the porch . I read thrillers , as I said , and although your books are n't strictly in that genre , they 're very suspenseful , so I read them , too , and your photograph 's on the back of the jacket . Believe me , Ms. Shane , no man would forget your face once he 'd seen it , even if he 'd seen it only in pictures and even if he was an old crock like me . " " But why did n't you say  --  " " At first I thought it was a joke . After all , the melodramatic way you appeared on my doorstep in the dead of night , the gun , the corny , hardboileddialogue . . . it all seemed like a gag . Believe me , I have certain friends who might think of such an elaborate hoax and , if they knew you , might be able to persuade you to join in the fun . " Pointing to her guardian , she said , " But when you saw him  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician said . Hurrying to his mother 's side , Chris pulled the Tootsie Pop from his mouth . " Mom , if he tells on us . . . Laura had drawn the .38 from her waistband . She began to raise it , then lowered her hand as she realized the gun no longer had any power to intimidateBrenkshaw ; in fact it had never frightened him . For one thing she now realized he was not the kind of man who could be intimidated , and forp190another thing she could not convincingly portray a lawless , dangerous woman when he knew who she really was . On the examination table her guardian groaned and tried to shift in his unnatural sleep , but Brenkshaw put a hand upon his chest and stilled him . " Listen , Doctor , if you tell anyone what happened here tonight , if you ca n't keep my visit a secret for the rest of your life , it 'll be the death of me and my boy . " " Of course the law requires a physician to report any gunshot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special case , " Laura said urgently . " I 'm not on the run from the law , Doctor . " " Who are you running from ? " " In a sense . . . from the same men who killed my husband , Chris 's father . " He looked surprised and pained . " Your husband was killed ? " " You must 've read about it in the papers , " she said bitterly . " It made a sensational story there for a while , the kind of thing the press loves . " " I 'm afraid I do n't read newspapers or watch television news , " Brenkshawsaid . " It 's all fires , accidents , and crazed terrorists . They do n't report real news , just blood and tragedy and politics . I 'm sorry about your husband . And if these people who killed him , whoever they are , want to kill you now , you should go straight to the police . " Laura liked this man and thought they shared more views and sympathiesthan not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of persuadingBrenkshaw to keep his mouth shut . " The police ca n't protect me , Doctor . No one can protect me except me  --  and maybe that man whose wounds you just sewed up . These people who 're after us . . . they 're relentless , implacable , and they 're beyond the law . " He shook his head . " No one is beyond the law . " " They are , Doctor . It 'd take me an hour to explain to you why they are , and then you probably would n't believe me . But I beg of you , unless you want our deaths on your conscience , keep your mouth shut about our being here . Not just for a few days but forever . " " Well ... " Studying him , she knew it was no use . She remembered what he had told her in the foyer earlier , when she had warned him not to lie about the presence of other people in the house : He did not lie , he said , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth was a lifelong habit . Hardly forty-five minutes later , she knew him well enough to believe that he was indeed an unusually truthful man . Even now , as she begged him to keep their visit secret , he was not able to tell the lie that would placate her and get her out of his office . He stared at her guiltily and could not tease the false/hood from his tongue . He would do his duty when she left ; he would file a police report . The cops would look for her at her house near Big Bear , where they would discover the blood if not the bodies of the time travelers , and where they would find hundreds of expended bullets , shattered windows , slug-pocked walls . By tomorrow or the next day the story would be splashed across the newspapers . . . . The airliner that had flown overhead more than half an hour ago might not have been a passing jet , after all . It might well have been what she had first thought it was  --  very distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a night without rain . " Doctor , help me get him dressed , " she said , indicating her guardian on the table beside them . " Do at least that much for me , since you 're going to betray me later . " He winced visibly at the word betray . Earlier she 'd sent Chris upstairs to get one each of Brenkshaw 's shirts , sweaters , jackets , slacks , a pair of his socks , and shoes . The physician was not as muscular and trim as her guardian , but they were approximately the same size . At the moment the wounded man was wearing only his bloodstained pants , but Laura knew there would not be time to put all the clothes on him . " Just help me get him into the jacket , Doctor . I 'll take the rest and dress him later . The jacket will be enough to protect him from the cold . " Reluctantly lifting the unconscious man into a sitting position on the examination table , the doctor said , " He should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wounded man 's right arm through the sleeve of the warmly lined corduroy jacket , Laura said , " Chris , go to the waiting room at the front of the house . It 's dark in there . Do n't turn on the lights . Go to the windows and give the street a good looking over , and for God 's sake do n't let yourself be seen . " " You think they 're here ? " the boy asked fearfully . " If not now , they will be soon , " she said , working her guardian 's left arm through the other jacket sleeve . " What 're you talking about ? " Brenkshaw asked , as Chris dashed into the adjoining office and on into the dark waiting room . Laura did n't answer . " Come on , let 's get him in the wheelchair . " Together , they lifted the wounded man off the examination table , into the chair , and buckled a restraining strap around his waist . As Laura was gathering up the other clothes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padding the clothes around the jars and tying it all together in the shirt , Chris raced back from the waiting room . " Mom , they 're just pulling up outside , it must be them , two cars full of men across the street , six or eight of ' em , anyway . What 're we going to do ? "  | " Damn , " she said , " we ca n't get to the Jeep now . And we ca n't go out the side door because they might see us from the front . " Brenkshaw headed toward his office . " I 'll call the police  --  " " No ! " She put the bundle of clothes and drugs on the wheelchair between her guardian 's legs , put her purse there , too , and snatched up the Uzi and .38 Chief 's Special . " There 's no time , damn you . They 'll be in here in a couple of minutes , and they 'll kill us . You 've got to help me get the wheelchairout the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at last conveyed to the physician , for he did not hesitate or continue to work at cross purposes to her . He grabbed the chair and wheeled it swiftly through a door that connected the examination room to the downstairs hall . Laura and Chris followed him along the gloomy corridor , then across a kitchen lit only by the illuminated digital clocks on the oven and microwave oven . The chair thumped over the sill between the kitchen and the back porch , badly jarring the wounded man , but he had been through worse . Slinging the Uzi over her shoulder and jamming the revolver into her waistband , Laura hurried around Brenkshaw to the bottom of the porch steps . She took hold of the wheelchair from the front , helping him trundle it to the concrete walk below . She glanced at the areaway between the house and garage , half expecting to see an armed man coming through there already , and she whispered to Brenkshaw , " You 'll have to go with us . They 'll kill you if you stay here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no argument but followed Chris , as the boy led the way down the walk that struck across the rear lawn to the gate in the redwood fence at the back of the long property . Having unslung the Uzi from her shoulder , Laura came last , ready to turn and open fire if she heard a noise from the house behind them . As Chris reached the gate , it opened in front of him , and a man dressed in black stepped through from the alley , darker than the night around them except for his moon-pale face and white hands , every bit as surprised by them as they were by him . He 'd come along the street beside the house and into the alley to cover the place from the back . In his left hand , gleaming darkly , was a submachine gun , not at the ready , but he started to bring it up  --  Laura could not blow him away , not without cutting her son down as well  --  but Chris reacted as Henry Takahami had spent months teaching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right arm , knocking the gun out of his grasp  --  it hit the lawn with a thump and soft clatter  --  then kicked again at his adversary 's crotch , and with a grunt of pain , the man in black fell backwardagainst the gatepost . By then Laura had stepped around the wheelchair and interposed her/self between Chris and the killer . She reversed the Uzi , raised it overhead , and brought the stock of it down on the assassin 's skull , struck him again with all her might , and he dropped to the lawn , away from the walk , without having had a chance to cry out . Events were moving fast now , too fast , they were on a downhill ride , and already Chris was going through the gate , so Laura followed , and they surprised a second man in black , eyes like holes in his white face , a vampiric figure , but this one was beyond the reach of a karate kick , so she had to open fire before he could use his own weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed burst that pounded into the assassin 's chest , throat , and neck , virtually decapitating him as it catapulted him backward onto the alley pavement . Brenkshaw had come through the gate behind them , pushing the wheelchairinto the alley , and Laura felt bad about having gotten him into this , but there was no going back now . The back street was narrow , flanked by the fenced yards of houses on both sides , with a few garages and clusters of garbage cans behind each property , poorly revealed by the lamps on the intersecting streets at each end of the block , with no lights of its own . To Brenkshaw , Laura said , " Wheel him across the alley and down a couple of doors . Find a gate that 's open and get him into somebody else 's yard , out of sight . Chris , you go with them . " " What about you ? " " I 'll follow you in a second . " " Mom  --  " " Go , Chris ! " she said , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the alleyway . As the boy reluctantly followed the doctor , Laura returned to the open redwood gate at the rear of Brenkshaw 's property . She was just in time to see two dark figures scuttle out of the areaway between the house and garage , thirty yards from her , barely visible , noticeable only because they were moving . They ran crouched , one of them heading toward the porch and the other toward the lawn because they did n't yet know exactly where the trouble was , where the gunfire had come from . She stepped through the gate , onto the walk , and opened up on them before they saw her , spraying the back of the house with bullets . Though she was not on top of her targets , she was in range  --  ninety feet was not far  --  and they dove for cover . She could not tell if she hit them , and she did n't continue to fire because even with a magazine of four hundred rounds expendedin short bursts , the Uzi could empty quickly ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She backed out of the gate and ran after Brenkshaw and Chris . They were just going through a wrought-iron gate at the back of a property on the other side of the alley , two doors down . When she got therep194and stepped into the yard , she found that old eugenias were planted along the iron fence to the left and right of the gate ; they had grown into a dense hedge , so no one would spot her easily from the alley unless they were directly in front of the gate itself . The physician had pushed the wheelchair all the way to the back of the house . It was Tudor , not Victorian like Brenkshaw 's , but also built at least forty or fifty years ago . The doctor was starting around the side of the place , into the driveway , heading toward the next major street . Lights winked on in houses all over the neighborhood . She was sure that faces were pressed to windows , including those where lights had not appeared , but she did n't think anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris at the front of the house and halted them in shadows near some overgrown shrubbery . " Doc , I 'd like you to wait here with your patient , " she whispered . He was shaking , and she hoped to God he did n't have a heart attack , but he was still game . " I 'll be here . " She took Chris out to the next street , where at least a score of cars were parked at the near and far curbs along that block . In the rain of bluish light from the streetlamps , the boy looked bad but not as awful as she had feared , not as frightened as the physician ; he was growing accustomed to terror . She said , " Okay , Let 's start trying car doors . You take this side , I 'll take the far side . If the door is open , check the ignition , under the driver 's seat , and behind the sun visor for keys . " " Gotcha . " Having once done research for a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had learned among other things that on average one out of seventeen drivers left his keys in his car overnight . She hoped the figure might be even more in their favor in a place like San Bernardino ; after all , in New York and Chicago and LA and other big cities , nobody but masochists left their keys in their cars , so for the average to work out to one in seventeen , there had to be more trusting people among other Americans . She attempted to keep an eye on Chris as she tried the doors of the cars along the far side of the street , but she soon lost track of him . Out of the first eight vehicles , four were unlocked , but no keys were in any of them . In the distance rose the wail of sirens . That would probably drive off the men in black . Anyway , they were most likely still searching along the alleyway behind Brenkshaw 's house , movingcautiously , expecting to be fired upon again . Laura moved boldly , with no caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flanking houses . The street was lined with mature but squat , stunted date palms that provided a lot of cover . Anyway , if anyone had been aroused at this dead hour of the night , they were probablyp195at second-floor windows , not trying to look down at their own street through the palms but over toward the next street , toward Brenkshaw 's place , where all the shooting had been . The ninth vehicle was an Oldsmobile Cutlass , and there were keys underthe seat . Just as she started the engine and pulled her door shut , Chris opened the door on the passenger 's side and showed her a set of keys that he had found . " Brand new Toyota , " he said . " This 'll do , " she said . The sirens were closer . Chris pitched the Toyota 's keys away , hopped into the car , and rode with her to the driveway of the house on the other side of the street , farther up toward the corner , where the doctor was waiting in the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yet come on . Maybe they were in luck ; maybe no one was home at that place . They lifted her guardian out of the wheelchair and laid him on the rear seat of the Cutlass . The sirens were very close now , and in fact a police cruiser shot past at the far end of that block , on the side street , red beacons flashing , heading toward Brenkshaw 's block . " You 'll be okay , Doctor ? " she asked , turning to him as she closed the back door of the Cutlass . He had dropped into the wheelchair . " No apoplexy , if that 's what you 're afraid of . What the hell is going on with you , girl ? " " No time , Doc . I have to split . " " Listen " he said , " maybe I wo n't tell them anything . " " Yes , you will , " she said . " You may think you wo n't , but you 'll tell them everything . If you were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a police report or a newspaper story , and without that record in the future , those gunmen could n't have found me . " " What 're you jibbering about ? " She leaned down and kissed his cheek . " No time to explain , Doc . Thanks for your help . And , sorry , but I 'd better take that wheelchair too . " He folded it and put it in the trunk for her . The night was full of sirens now . She got behind the wheel , slammed her door . " Buckle up , Chris . " " Buckled , " he said . She turned left at the end of the driveway and drove to the far corner of the block , away from Brenkshaw 's end of the neighborhood , to the intersectingstreet on which a cruiser had flashed by only a moment ago . She figured that if police were converging in answer to reports of automatic-weapons fire , they would be coming from different areas of the city , from different patrols , so maybe no other car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted , and the only other vehicles she saw were not fitted with rooftop emergency beacons . She turned right , heading steadily farther away from the Brenkshaw place , across San Bernardino , wondering where she would find sanctuary . Laura reached Riverside at 3:15 in the morning , stole a Buick from a quiet residential street , shifted her guardian to it with the wheelchair , and abandonedthe Cutlass . Chris slept through the entire operation and had to be carried from one car to the other . Half an hour later , in another neighborhood , exhausted and in need of sleep , she used a screwdriver from a tool pouch in the Buick 's trunk to steal a set of license plates from a Nissan . She put the Nissan 's plates on the Buick and put the Buick 's plates in the trunk because they would eventually turn up on a police hot sheet . A couple of days might pass before the Nissan 's owner noticed his plates were missing , and even when he reported them stolen , the police would not treat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plates were usually taken by kids playing a stupid prank or vandals , and their recovery was not a high priority for overworked police laboring under heavy caseloads of major crimes . That was one more useful fact she had learned while researchingthe book in which a car thief had played a secondary role . She also paused long enough to dress her guardian in wool socks , shoes , and a pullover sweater to keep him from catching a chill . At one point he opened his eyes , blinked at her , and said her name , and she thought he was coming around , but then he slipped away again , muttering in a language that she could not identify because she could not hear any of the words clearly . She drove from Riverside to Yorba Linda in Orange County , where she parked in a corner of a Ralph 's Supermarket lot , behind a Goodwill collection station , at 4:50 in the morning . She killed the engine and lights , unbuckled her safety harness . Chris was still buckled up , leaning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , her guardian was still unconscious , though his breathing was not quite as wheezy as it had been before they had visited Carter Brenkshaw . Laura did not think she would be able to doze off ; she hoped just to collect her wits and rest her eyes , but in a minute or two she was asleep . After killing at least three men , after being shot at repeatedly , after stealing two cars , after surviving a chase that had harried her through three counties , she might have expected to dream of death , of blasted bodies and blood , with the cold chatter of automatic-weapons fire as background musicp197to the nightmare . She might have expected to dream of losing Chris , for he was one of the two remaining lights in her personal darkness , he and Thelma , and she dreaded the thought of going on without him . But instead she dreamed of Danny , and they were lovely dreams , not nightmares . Danny was alive again , and they were reliving the sale of Shadrach for more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was eight years old , though in fact Chris had not been born at that time , and they were celebrating their good fortune by spending the day at Disneyland , where the three of them had their picture taken with Mickey Mouse , and in the Carnation Pavilion Danny told her he 'd love her forever , while Chris pretended that he could speak in an all-snort pig language that he had learned from Carl Dockweiler , who was sitting at the next table with Nina and with Laura 's father , and at another table the amazing Ackerson twins were eating strawberry sundaes . She woke more than three hours later at 8:26 , feeling rested as much because of that familial communion , provided by her subconscious , as because of the sleep itself . Sunlight from a cloudless sky sparkled on the car 's chrome and fell in a bright , brassy shaft through the rear window . Chris was still dozing . In the back seat the wounded man had not regained consciousness . She risked a quick walk to a telephone booth beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With change she had in her purse , she called Ida Palomar , Chris 's tutor in Lake Arrowhead , to tell her they would be away from home all week . She did not want poor Ida to walk unsuspecting into the bullet-riddled , blood-spattered house near Big Bear , where police forensic teams were no doubt hard at work . She did not tell Ida where she was calling from ; nevertheless , she did not intend to remain in Yorba Linda much longer . After she returned to the car , she sat yawning , stretching , and massaging the back of her neck , as she watched early shoppers entering and leaving the supermarket a couple of hundred feet away . She was hungry . With sleepmattedeyes and sour breath , Chris woke less than ten minutes later , and she gave him money to go into the market and buy a package of sweet rolls and two pints of orange juice , not the most nutritional breakfast but energygiving . " What about him ? " Chris asked , indicating her guardian . She remembered Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she also knew that she could not force-feed him liquids when he was comatose ; he would choke to death . " Well . . . bring a third orange juice . Maybe I can coax him awake . " As Chris got out of the car , she said , " Might as well get us something for lunch , something that wo n't spoil  --  say a loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter . And get a can of spray deodorant and a bottle of shampoo . "  |p198He  grinned . " Why wo n't you let me eat this way at home ? " " Because if you do n't get good nutrition , you 're going to wind up with a brain even more twisted than the one you 've got now , kiddo . " " Even on the lam from hired killers , I 'm surprised you did n't pack a microwave , fresh vegetables , and a bottle of vitamins . " " Are you saying I 'm a good mother but a fussbudget ? Compliment noted and point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door . She said , " And , Chris . . . " " I know , " the boy said . " Be careful . " While Chris was gone , she started the engine and switched on the radio to listen to the nine o'clock news . She heard a story about herself : the scene at her house near Big Bear , the shoot-out in San Bernardino . Like most news stories it was inaccurate , disjointed , and made little sense . But it confirmed that the police were looking for her throughout southern California . Accordingto the reporter , the authorities expected to locate her soon , largely becauseher face was already widely known . She had been shocked last night when Carter Brenkshaw recognized her as Laura Shane , famous writer . She did not think of herself as a celebrity ; she was only a storyteller , a weaver of tales , who worked with a loom of language , making a special fabric from words . She had done only one book tour for an early novel , had loathed that dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a regular guest on television talkshows . She had never endorsed a product in a TV commercial , had never gone public in support of a politician , and had in general attempted to avoid being part of the media circus . She observed the tradition of having a dust jacket photograph on her books because it seemed harmless , and by the age of thirty-three she could admit without severe embarrassment that she was an unusually striking woman , but she never imagined , as the police put it , that her face was widely known . Now she was dismayed not only because her loss of anonymity made her easier quarry for the police but because she knew that becoming a celebrity in modern America was tantamount to a loss of one 's self-critical faculties and a severe decline of artistic power . A few managed to be both public figures and worthwhile writers , but most seemed to be corrupted by the media attention . Laura dreaded that trap almost as much as she dreaded being picked up by the police . Suddenly , with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a celebrity and losing her artistic center , she must still believe in a safe future in which she would write more books . At times during the night , she had vowed to fight to the death , to struggle to a bloody end to protect her son , but throughout she had felt that their situation was virtually hopeless ,  |p199their  enemy too powerful and unreachable to be destroyed . Now something had changed her , had brought her around to a dim , guarded optimism . Maybe it had been the dream . Chris returned with a large package of pecan-cinnamon rolls , three onepintcontainers of orange juice , and the other items . They ate the rolls and drank the juice , and nothing had ever tasted better . When she finished her own breakfast , Laura got in the back seat and tried to wake her guardian . He could not be roused . She gave the third carton of orange juice to Chris and said , " Keep it for him . He 'll probably wake up soon . " " If he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chris said . " He does n't need to take any for a few hours yet . Dr. Brenkshaw gave him a pretty potent shot last night ; it 's still working . " But Laura was worried . If he did not regain consciousness , they might never learn the true nature of the dangerous maze in which they were now lost  --  and might never find a way out of it . " What next ? " Chris asked . " We 'll find a service station , use the rest rooms , then stop at a gunshop and buy ammunition for the Uzi and the revolver . After that . . . we start looking for a motel , just the right kind of motel , a place where we can hide out . When they settled in somewhere , they would be at least fifty miles from Dr. Brenkshaw 's place , where their enemies had last found them . But did distance matter to men who measured their journeys strictly in days and years rather than miles ? Parts of Santa Ana , neighborhoods on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest number of motels of the type she was seeking . She did not want a modern , gleaming Red Lion Inn or Howard Johnson 's Motor Lodge with color television sets , deep-pile carpet , and a heated swimming pool , because reputable establishments required valid ID and a major credit card , and she dared not risk leaving a paper trail that would bring either the police or the assassins down on her . Instead she was seeking a motel that was no longer clean enough or in good enough repair to attract tourists , a seedy place where they were happy to get the business , eager to take cash , and reluctant to ask questions that would drive away guests . She knew she would have a hard time finding a room , and she was not surprised to discover that the first twelve places she tried were unable or unwilling to accommodate her . The only people who could be seen going from or coming to those dead-end motels were young Mexican women withp200babies in their arms or young children in tow , and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts , and lightweight denim or corduroy jackets , some wearing straw cowboy hats and some baseball caps , and all of them with an air of watchfulness and suspicion . Most decrepit motels had become boarding houses for illegal immigrants , hundreds of thousands of whom had taken up not-so-secret residence in Orange County alone . Whole families lived in a single room , five or six or seven of them crowded into that cramped space , sharing one ancient bed and two chairs and a bathroom with minimally functional plumbing , for which they paid a hundred and fifty dollars or more every week , with no linen or maid service or amenities of any kind , but with cockroaches by the thousands . Yet they were willing to endure those conditions and let themselves be outrageously exploitedas underpaid workers rather than return to their homeland and live under the rule of the " revolutionary people 's government " that for decades had given them no brotherhood but that of despair . At the thirteenth motel , The Bluebird of Happiness , the owner-managerstill hoped to serve the lower end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the temptation to squeeze a rich living from the blood of poor immigrants . A few of the twenty-four units were obviously rented to illegals , but the management still provided fresh linen daily , maid service , television sets , and two spare pillows in every closet . However the fact that the desk clerk took cash , did not press her for ID , and avoided meeting her eyes was sad proof that in another year The Bluebird of Happiness would be one more monument to political stupidity and human avarice in a world as crowded with such monuments as any old , city cemetery was crowded with tombstones . The motel had three wings in a U-shape , with parking in the middle , and their unit was in the right rear corner of the back wing . A big fan palm flourished near the door to their room , not visibly touched by smog or limited by its small patch of ground midst so much concrete and blacktop , bristling with new growth even in winter , as if nature had chosen it as a subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth again when humankind passed on . Laura and Chris unfolded the wheelchair and got the wounded man into it , making no effort to conceal what they were doing , as if they were simply caring for a disabled person . Fully dressed , with his wounds concealed , her guardian could pass for a paraplegic  --  except for the way his head lolled against his shoulder . Their room was small though passably clean . The carpet was worn but recently shampooed , and a pair of dustballs in one corner were far from the size of tumbleweeds . The maroon-plaid spread on the queen-size bed was tattered at the edges , and its pattern was not quite busy enough to concealp201two patches , but the sheets were crisp and smelled faintly of detergent . They moved her guardian from the wheelchair to the bed and put two pillows under his head . The seventeen-inch television set was firmly bolted to a table with a scarred , laminated top , and the back legs of the table were in turn bolted to the floor . Chris sat in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turned the cracked dial in search of either a cartoon show or reruns of an old sitcom . He settled for Get Smart but complained that it was " too stupid to be funny , " and Laura wondered how many boys his age would have thought so . She sat in the other chair . " Why do n't you get a shower ? " " Then just get back in these same clothes ? " he asked doubtfully . " I know it sounds like purest folly , but try it . I guarantee you 'll feelcleaner even without fresh clothes . " " But all that trouble to shower , then get into wrinkled clothes ? " " When did you become such a fashion plate that you 're offended by a few wrinkles ? " He grinned , got up from his chair , and pranced to the bathroom as he thought a hopeless fop might prance . " The king and queen would be shocked to see me such a mess . " " We 'll make them put on blindfolds when they visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a minute . " There 's a dead bug in the toilet bowl . I think it 's a cockroach , but I 'm not really sure . " " Does the species matter ? Will we be notifying next of kin ? " Chris laughed . God , she loved to hear him laugh . He said , " What should I do  --  flush him ? " " Unless you want to fish him out , put him in a matchbox , and bury him in the flowerbed outside . " He laughed again . " Nope . Burial at sea . " In the bathroom , he hummed " Taps , " then flushed the john . While the boy was showering , Get Smart ended and a movie came on , The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan ' s Island . Laura was not actually watchingthe set ; she left it on for background , but there were limits to what even a woman on the lam could endure , so she quickly switched to channel eleven and Hour Magazine . She stared at her guardian for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair she reached to the drapes a few times , parting them far enough to scan the motel 's parking lot , but no one on earth could know where she was ; she was in no imminent danger . So she stared at the TV screen , uninterested in what it offered , until she was half hypnotized by it . The Hour Magazine host was interviewing a young actor who droned on about himself , not always making much sense , and after a while she wasp202vaguely aware that he kept saying something about water , but now she was beginning to doze off , and his insistent talk of water was both mesmeric and annoying . ' Mom ? " She blinked , sat up , and saw Chris in the bathroom doorway . He 'd just gotten out of the shower . His hair was damp , and he was dressed only in his briefs . The sight of his thin , boyish body  --  all ribs and elbows and knees  --  pulled at her heart , for he looked so innocent and vulnerable . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever protect him , and renewed fear rose in her . " Mom , he 's talking , " Chris said , pointing to the man on the bed " Did n't you hear him ? He 's talking . " " Water , " her guardian said thickly . " Water . " She went quickly to the bed and bent over him . He was no longer comatose . He was trying to sit up , but he had no strength . His blue eyes were open , and although they were bloodshot , they focused on her , alert and observant . " Thirsty , " he said . She said , " Chris  --  " He was already there with a glass of water from the bathroom . She sat on the bed beside her guardian , lifted his head , took the water from Chris , and helped the wounded man drink . She allowed him only small sips ; she did n't want him to choke . His lips were fever-chapped , and his tongue was coated with a white film , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of a glass of water , then indicated that he 'd had enough . After she lowered his head to the pillow , she put a hand to his forehead . " Not so hot as he was . " He rolled his head from side to side , trying to look at the room . In spite of the water , his voice was dry , burnt out . " Where are we ? " " Safe , " she said . " Nowhere . . . is safe . " " We may have figured out more of this crazy situation than you realize , " she told him . " Yeah , " Chris said , sitting on the bed beside his mother . " We know you 're a time traveler ! " The man looked at the boy , managed a weak smile , winced in pain . " I 've got drugs , " Laura said . " A painkiller . " " No , " he said . " Not now . Later maybe . More water ? " Laura lifted him once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re mained in the glass . She remembered the penicillin and put a capsule be tween his teeth . He washed it down with the last two swallows . " When do you come from ? " Chris asked , intensely interested , obliviousp203of the droplets of bathwater that tracked out of his damp hair and down his face . " When ? " " Honey , " Laura said , " he 's very weak , and I do n't think we should bother him with too many questions just yet . " " He can tell us that much , anyway , Mom . " To the wounded man , Chris said , " When do you come from ? " He stared at Chris , then at Laura , and the haunted look was in his eyes again . " When do you come from ? Huh ? The year 2100 ? 3000 ? " In his paper-dry voice , her guardian said , " Nineteen forty-four . " The little bit of activity had clearly tired him already , for his eyelids looked heavy , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certain that he had lapsed into delirium again . " When ? " Chris repeated , baffled by the answer he had been given . " Nineteen forty-four . " " That 's impossible , " Chris said . " Berlin , " her guardian said . " He 's delirious , " Laura told Chris . His voice was slurred now as weariness dragged him down , but what he said was unmistakable : " Berlin . " " Berlin ? " Chris said . " You mean  --  Berlin , Germany ? " Sleep claimed the wounded man , not the unnatural sleep of a coma but restful sleep that was immediately marked by soft snoring , though in the moment before he slipped away , he said , " Nazi Germany . " One Life to Live was on the television , but neither she nor Chris was paying any attention to the soap opera . They had drawn the two chairs closer to the bed , where they could watch the sleeping man . Chris was dressed , and his hair was mostly dry , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura felt grimy and longed for a shower , but she was not going to leave her guardian in case he woke again and was able to talk . She and the boy spoke in whispers : " Chris , it just occurred to me , if these people were from the future , why would n't they have been carrying laser guns or something futuristic when they came for us ? " " They would n't want everyone to know they were from the future , " Chris said . " They 'd bring weapons and wear clothes that would n't be out of place here . But , Mom , he said he was from  --  "  | " I know what he said . But it does n't make sense , does it ? If they had time travel in 1944 , we 'd know about it by now , would n't we ? " At one-thirty her guardian woke and seemed briefly confused as to his whereabouts . He asked for more water , and Laura helped him drink . He said he was feeling a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asked to be propped up higher . Chris got the two spare pillows from the closet and helped his mother raise the wounded man . " What is your name ? " Laura asked . " Stefan . Stefan Krieger . " She repeated the name softly , and it was all right , not melodic but solid , a masculine-sounding name . It was just not the name of a guardian angel , and she was mildly amused to realize that after so many years , including two decades during which she had professed to have no belief in him , she still expected his name to be musical and unearthly . " And you really come from  --  " " Nineteen forty-four , " he repeated . Just the effort required to move to a sitting position had wrung fine beads of perspiration from his brow  --  or perhaps the sweat resulted in part from thoughts of the time and place where his long journey had begun . " Berlin , Germany . There was a brilliant Polish scientist , Vladimir Penlovski , considered a madman by some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think  --  but also a genius . He was in Warsaw , working on certain theories about the nature of time for more than twentyfiveyears before Germany and Russia collaborated to invade Poland in 1939 .... " Penlovski , according to Stefan Krieger , was a Nazi sympathizer and welcomed Hitler 's forces . Perhaps he knew that from Hitler he would receive the kind of financial backing for his researches that he could not get from sources more rational . Under the personal patronage of Hitler himself , Penlovski and his closest assistant , Wladyslaw Januskaya , went to Berlin to establish an institute for temporal research , which was so secret that it was given no name . It was simply called the institute . There , in association with German scientists no less committed and no less farsighted than he , financed by a seemingly inexhaustible river of funds from the Third Reich , Penlovski had found a way to pierce the artery of time and move at will through that bloodstream of days and months and years . " Blitzstrasse , " Stefan said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris said . " Like Blitzkrieg -- lightning war  --  in all those old movies . " " Lightning Road in this case , " Stefan said . " The road through time . The road to the future . " It literally could have been called Zukunftstrasse , or Future Road , Stefai I explained , for Vladimir Penlovski had been unable to discover a way to sendp205men backward in time from the gate he had invented . They could travel only forward , into their future , and return automatically to their own era . " There seems to be some cosmic mechanism that prohibits time travelersfrom meddling with their own pasts in order to change their present-day circumstances . You see , if they could travel back in time to their own past , there would develop certain  --  " " Paradoxes ! " Chris said excitedly . Stefan looked surprised to hear the boy speak that word . Smiling , Laura said , " As I told you , we 've had rather a long discussion about your possible origins , and time travel turned out to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at my resident expert on the weird , " " Paradox , " Stefan agreed . " It 's the same word in English and German . If a time traveler could go back in time to his own past and affect some event in history , that change would have tremendous ramifications . It would alter the future from which he had come . Therefore he would n't be able to return to the same world he 'd left  --  " " Paradox ! " Chris said gleefully . " Paradox , " Stefan agreed . " Apparently nature abhors a paradox and generally will not permit a time traveler to create one . And thank God for that . Because . . . suppose , for example , Hitler sent an assassin back in time to kill Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill long before they rose to high office , which would have resulted in the election of different men in the U.S. and England , men who might have been less brilliant and more easily dealt with , leading to Hitler 's triumph by ' 44 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his physical condition would not allow him to sustain , and Laura could see it taking a toll of him word by word . The perspiration had almost dried on his brow ; but now , although he was not even gesturing , a new thin film of sweat silvered his pale forehead again . The circles of fatigue around his eyes appeared to grow darker . But she could not stop him and order him to rest , because she wanted and needed to hear everything he had to say  --  and because he would not have allowed her to stop him . " Suppose der Fuhrer could send back assassins to kill Dwight Eisenhower , George Patton , Field Marshal Montgomery , kill them in their cradles , when they were babies , eliminating them and others , all the best military minds the Allies possessed . Then most of the world would have been his by ' 44 , in which case time travelers would have been going back in time to kill those men who had already long been dead and posed no threat . Paradox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such paradox , no such tampering with the time traveler 's own past , for otherwise Adolf Hitler would have turned the entire world into a concentration camp , a crematorium . " They were silent a while , as the possibility of such hell on earth struckp206each of them . Even Chris responded to the picture of an altered world that Stefan painted , for he was a child of the eighties , in which the villains of film and television melodramas were usually either voracious aliens from a distant star or Nazis . The Swastika , the silver death's-head symbol and black uniformsof the SS , and that strange fanatic with the small mustache were to Chris especially terrifying because they were part of the media-created mythologyon which he had been raised . Laura knew that real people and events , once subsumed by mythology , were somehow more real to a child than the very bread he ate . Stefan said , " So from the institute we could go only forward in time , but that had its uses too . We could leap forward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark days of the war and had somehow turned the tide . But of course we found that Germany had not done any such thing , that the Third Reich had been defeated . Yet with all the knowledge of the future to draw from , could not that tide be turned , after all ? Surely there were things Hitler could do to save the Reich even as late as ' 44 . And there were things that might be brought back from the future with which the war might be won  --  " " Such as , " Chris said , " atomic bombs ! " " Or the knowledge of how they were built , " Stefan said . " The Reich already had a nuclear research program , you know , and if they 'd had a breakthroughearly enough , had split the atom . . . " " They 'd have won the war , " Chris said . Stefan asked for water and drank half a glass this time . He wanted to hold the glass in his good hand , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Laura had to help him . When he spoke again , Stefan 's voice wavered at times . " Because the time traveler exists outside of time during his journey , he is not only able to move in time but geographically , as well . Picture him hanging above the earth , unmoving , as the globe turns below him . That 's not what he does , of course , but it 's easier to see that image than to imagine him hovering in another dimension . Now , as he hangs above the world , it turns below him , and if his journey to the future is gauged properly , he can travel to a precise time at which he will find himself in Berlin , the same city he left years before . But if he chooses to travel a few hours more or less , the world will have turned that much more beneath him , and he will arrive at a different place on its surface . The calculations to achieve a precise arrival are monumentallydifficult in my era , 1944  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris said , " with computers . " Shifting in discomfort against the pillows that propped him up , putting his trembling right hand against his wounded left shoulder as if to quell the pain by his own touch , he said , " Teams of German physicists , accompaniedp207by Gestapo , were sent secretly to various cities in Europe and the United States in the year 1985 , to accumulate vital information on the making of nuclear weapons . The material they were after was not classified or difficult to find . With what they already knew from their own researches , they could obtain the rest from textbooks and scientific publications readily available at any major university library in ' 85 . Four days before I departed the institute for the last time , those teams returned from ' 85 to March , 1944 , with materialthat would give the Third Reich a nuclear arsenal before the autumn of that year . They were to spend a few weeks studying the material at the institute before deciding how and where to introduce that knowledge into the German nuclear program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that I had to destroy the institute and everything it contained , key personnel as well as files , to prevent a future shaped by Adolf Hitler . " As Laura and Chris listened , rapt , Stefan Krieger told them how he had planted explosives in the institute , how on the last of his days in ' 44 he had shot Penlovski , Januskaya , and Volkaw , and had programmed the time gate to bring him to Laura in present-day America . But something had gone wrong at the last minute , as Stefan was leaving . The public power supply failed . The RAF had bombed Berlin for the first time in January that year , and U.S. bombers had made the first daylight runs on March 6 , so the power supply had been interrupted often , not merely due to bomb damage but also because of the work of saboteurs . It was to guard against such interruptions that the gate itself was powered by a secure generator . Stefan heard no bombers that day when , wounded by Kokoschka , he had crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saboteurs . " And the timer on the explosives stopped . The gate was not destroyed . It 's still open back there , and they can come after us . And . . . they can still win the war . " Laura was getting another headache . She put her fingertips to her temples . " But wait . Hitler ca n't have succeeded in building atomic weapons and winning World War Two , because we do n't live in a world where that happened . You do n't have to worry . Somehow , in spite of all the knowledge they took back through the gate , they obviously failed to develop a nuclear arse-nal . " " No , " he said . " They 've failed so far , but we ca n't assume they will continue to fail . To those men at the institute in Berlin in 1944 , their past is immutable , as I have said . They can not travel backward in time and change their own past . But they can change their future and ours , because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to alter it . " " But his future is my past , " Laura said . " And if the past ca n't be changed , how can he change mine ? " " Yeah , " Chris said . " Paradox . "  |p208Laura  said , " Listen , I have n't spent the last thirty-four years in a world ruled by Adolf Hitler and his heirs ; therefore , in spite of the gate , Hitler failed . " Stefan 's expression was dismal . " If time travel were invented now , in 1989 , that past of which you speak  --  World War Two and every event since  --  would be unalterable . You could not change it , for nature 's rule against backward time-travel and time-travel paradoxes would apply to you . But time travel has not been discovered here  --  or rediscovered . The time travelers at the institute in Berlin in ' 44 are free to change their future , apparently , and though they will simultaneously be changing your past , nothing in the laws of nature will stop them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the only one that for some reason nature seems to allow . " " You 're saying they could still build nuclear weapons back then with the information they got in ' 85 , " Laura said , " and win the war ? " " Yes . Unless the institute is destroyed first . " " And what then ? Suddenly , all around us , we find things changed , find ourselves living under Nazism ? " " Yes . And you wo n't even know what 's happened , because you will be a different person than you are now . Your entire past will never have occurred . You will have lived a different past altogether , and you will remember nothing else , none of what has happened to you in this life because this life will never have existed . You will think the world has always been as it is , that there was never a world in which Hitler lost . " What he was proposing terrified and appalled her because it made life seem even more fragile than she had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed no more real than the world of a dream ; it was apt to dissolve without warning and send her tumbling into a great , dark void . With growing horror she said , " If they change the world in which I grew up , I might never have met Danny , never married . " " I might never have been born , " Chris said . She reached to Chris and put a hand on his arm , not only to reassure him but to reassure herself of his current solidity . " I might not have been born myself . Everything I 've seen , the good and bad of the world that 's been since 1944 . . . it 'll all wash away like an elaborate sandcastle , and a new reality will exist in its place . " " A new and worse reality , " Stefan said , clearly exhausted by the effort he had made to explain what was at stake . " In that new world , I might never have written my novels . " " Or if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be different from those you 've done in this life , grotesque works produced by an artist laboring under the rule of an oppressive government , in the iron fist of Nazi censor-ship. "  | " If those guys build the atom bomb in 1944 , " Chris said , " then we 'll all just crumble into dust and blow away . " " Not literally . But like dust , yes , " Stefan Krieger agreed . " Gone , with no trace that we 've ever been . " " We 've got ta stop them , " Chris said . " If we can , " Stefan agreed . " But first we 've got to stay alive in this reality , and that might not be easy . " Stefan needed to relieve himself , and Laura helped him into the motel bathroom , handling him as if she were a nurse accustomed to matter-of-fact dealings with the plumbing of sick men . By the time she returned him to the bed , she was worried about him again ; though he was muscular , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told him briefly about the shoot-out at Brenkshaw 's , through which he had remained comatose . " If these assassins are coming from the past instead of the future , how do they know where to find us ? How did they know in 1944 that we 'd be at Dr. Brenkshaw 's when we were , forty-five years later ? " " To find you , " Stefan said , " they made two trips . First , they went fartherinto the future , a couple of days farther , to this coming weekend perhaps , to see if you had shown up anywhere by then . If you had n't  --  and apparently you had not  --  then they started checking the public record . Back issues of newspapers , for one thing . They looked for the stories about the shooting at your house last night , and in those stories they read that you 'd taken a wounded man to Brenkshaw 's place in San Bernardino . So they simply returned to ' 44 and made a second trip  --  this time to Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 11 . " " They can hopscotch around us , " Chris told Laura . " They can pop ahead in time to see where we show up , then they pick and choose the easiest place along the time stream to ambush us . It 's sorta like . . . if we were cowboys and the Indians were all psychic . " " Who was Kokoschka ? " Chris wanted to know . " Who was the man who killed my dad ? " " Head of institute security , " Stefan said . " He claimed to be a distant relation of Oskar Kokoschka , the noted Austrian expressionist painter , but I doubt if it was true because in our Kokoschka there was no hint of an artist 's sensitivity . Standartenfiihrer  --  which means Colonel  --  Heinrich Kokoschka was an efficient killer for the Gestapo . " " Gestapo , " Chris said , awestruck . " Secret police ? "  | " State police , " Stefan said . " Widely known to exist but allowed to oper ate in secrecy . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a surprised as you . There 'd been no lightning . He must have arrived far awaN from us , fifteen or twenty miles , in some other valley of the San Bernardinos. and the lightning had been beyond our notice . " The lightning associated with time travel was in fact a very localized phenomenon , Stefan explained " After Kokoschka showed up there , on my trail , I thought I would return to the institute and find all of my colleagues outraged at my treason , but when I got there , no one took special notice of me . I was confused . Then after I killed Penlovski and the others , when I was in the main lab preparing for my final jaunt into the future , Heinrich Kokoschka burst in and shot me . He was n't dead ! Not dead on that highway in 1988 . Then I realized that Kokoschka had obviously only just learned of my treason when he 'd found the men I 'd shot . He would travel to 1988 and try to kill me  --  and all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate would have to remain open to allow him to do so , and that I was destined to fail to destroy it . At least at that time . " " God , this headache , " Laura said . Chris seemed to have no trouble whatsoever following the tangled threads of time travel . He said , " So after you traveled to our house last night , Kokoschka traveled to 1988 and killed my dad . Jeez ! In a way , Mr. Krieger , you killed Kokoschka forty-three years after he shot you in that lab . . . yet you had shot him before he shot you . This is wild stuff . Mom , is n't this wild ? Is n't this great ? " " It 's something , " she agreed . " And how did Kokoschka know to find you on that mountain road ? " " After he discovered I 'd shot Penlovski , and after I escaped through the gate , Kokoschka must have found the explosives in the attic and basement Then he must have dug into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate is used . That was a bit of data tracking that was my responsibility , so no one previously had noticed all my jaunts into your life , Laura . Anyway , Kokoschka must have done some time traveling of his own . must have taken a lot of trips to see where I 'd been going , secretly watching ; me watch you , watching me alter your destiny for the better . He must have been watching the day I came to the cemetery when your father was buried . and he must have been watching when I beat Sheener , but I never saw hint So from all the trips I made into your life , from all the times I just observed you and the times I acted to save you , he picked a place at which to kill us He wanted to kill me because I was a traitor , and he wanted to kill you and your family because . . . well because he realized you were so important t me.
