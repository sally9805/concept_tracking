While scanning some routine sky photographs at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile last week , Astronomer Ian Shelton felt a surge of excitement . In an exposure he had taken just hours before with one of the observatory 's small telescopes was a bright spot that had not appeared in older pictures . Stepping out into the clear mountain air of the Chilean coastal range , the University of Toronto scientist reverted to a technique now used only rarely by professional stargazers : he looked up at the sky . There , in the fuzzy patch of light known as the Large Magellanic Cloud , was the spot . Says Shelton : " For more than three hours , I tried several logical explanations . It took me a long time to actually accept that what I had just seen was a supernova . " <P> But a supernova it was , a massive star dying in an explosion so violent that for a few weeks it will outshine hundreds of millions of stars put together . Its home , the Large Magellanic Cloud , is a satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the fringes of our Milky Way galaxy , some 170,000 light-years from earth . ( A light-year , the distance light travels in a year , is roughly 6 trillion miles . ) <P> At that distance , close by astronomical standards , it could be one of the brightest stars in the sky when it peaks in intensity , perhaps as early as next week . ( While it is clearly visible in the Southern Hemisphere , even Hawaii is too far north for much of a view . ) The star will be the brightest supernova observed since 1604 and the only one visible to the naked eye since 1885 . Says University of Chicago Astronomer W. David Arnett : " This is probably the most important thing that 's happened in astronomy since 1604 . It finally gives us a way of testing ideas about how stars and galaxies work and how abundances of heavy elements are created . " The reason for the superlatives being expressed by Arnett and other astronomers is that this is $ the first supernova close enough to the earth to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realizing the importance of his discovery , Shelton moved quickly to contact the International Astronomical Union 's telegram service in Cambridge , Mass. , the world 's clearinghouse for announcements of new comets , asteroids and other transient astronomical phenomena . Shelton was the first to report the supernova , but , according to Service Director Brian Marsden , a New Zealand amateur astronomer named Albert Jones also spotted it that night . By the end of the day the service had sent telegrams announcing the supernova , officially designated 1987A , to some 150 institutions around the world .
