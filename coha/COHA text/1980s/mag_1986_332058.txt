For two hours the House debated a Democratic proposal that would have banned any new U.S. funds to the contras fighting Nicaragua 's Sandinista government . Even supporters of such a total ban viewed it as doomed . As soon as it was defeated , they figured , they would offer another measure that would give President Reagan a fraction of the $100 million he wants in contra aid . But as the scoreboard ticked off the tally , Democrats watched in amazement . The measure was winning , mainly because few Republicans were voting . Suddenly , with time running out , the Republicans pushed their vote buttons in a rush and  --  what was this ?  --  all but one hit the aye choice . The ban passed , 361 to 66 . Republicans stood in the chamber , applauding and laughing . <P> Across the aisle , the realization slowly dawned on the Democrats that the G.O.P. had outfoxed them . After the House rebuffed contra aid a month ago , Speaker Tip O'Neill had agreed to bring the matter back to the House floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriations bill packed with goodies for legislators . He knew that the President was opposed to the pork-barrel bill . He also knew that it would take weeks or months before the House version could be reconciled with a Senate bill and put into a form that Reagan might sign . Thus , attaching the contra aid to the spending bill meant at least a long delay in money for the rebels , and even then , it would pose a difficult decision for Reagan on whether to veto the combined legislation . <P> After last week 's vote , Republican Leader Bob Michel charged that the Democrats were playing a " variation of the old con game , ' Heads I win ; tails you lose . ' " Declared Michel : " We refuse to play . " Recognizing that he had been outwitted , O'Neill withdrew the measure . But where did that leave the contras ? In confused limbo . The Senate has approved the President 's aid request ; the House has not . Michel announced that he intends to seek a " clean " vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of the House ( 218 members ) to bring a bill directly to the floor . If he succeeds , the earliest vote could come on May 12 . If he fails , the contra funding would be at least indefinitely delayed . <P> While unfortunate , the congressional indecision may also be understandable . A New York Times/CBS News poll last week showed that , despite all the heat in Washington on the issue , only 38% of Americans are even aware that the U.S. has backed the contras in their fight against the Sandinista regime .
