" Evildoer , " someone offered . " One syllable , " Mr. Harnick reminded him. // " I suggest ' Creep , ' " said Beverly Morgan , an actress , and laughter rippled through the group. // It was a brief moment of irreverence the other night in an otherwise arduous and precise process : writing English lyrics to " La Tragedie de Carmen , " Peter Brook ' s adaptation of the Bizet opera . The translation had been Mr. Harnick ' s solitary duty ; but now , with the debut of the English version set for sometime in March , he joined Mr. Brook and the cast for a bit of composition by committee. // There certainly was not a problem with the Brook " Carmen " in French . After playing in Paris and touring Europe , it opened at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in October to critical acclaim and strong box-office sales . But Mr. Brook said it had been his desire all along to alternate performances in English and French. // <> <> ' Audiences Are Touched ' // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " is for it to be accessible , for there not to be barriers . Audiences are touched when they realize an effort has been made for them specially . It brings them closer to us. " // But what is accessible to an audience is bedeviling to the company . " Doing the translation is fiendishly difficult , " Mr. Brook said . " You ' re doing something as demanding as a crossword puzzle . Each word has to have the right meter , the right sound and the right vowels and consonants to meet the needs of the singer . That ' s a terribly lot to ask from any word. " // It is particularly difficult on the veteran members of the cast , some of whom have performed in the French- language version for three years . " It ' s like learning a whole different show , " said Emily Golden , one of four women who alternate in the title role . " Right now , the majority of our audience doesn ' t speak French and if we speak poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser . But if we sing in English , the audience expects it to be good English and to get every joke , every nuance. " // The success of the current version of " Carmen " has led some admirers of the work to wonder if , by using English lyrics , the show will have less need to be theatrical and will lose some of its power and mystique . Mr. Brook scoffs at the notion. // " There were days when there was a mystique to opera being incomprehensible , " he said . " I would rather the mystery and mystique come from more genuine sources than misunderstanding . It ' s like lighting . There are some people who believe turning the lights on an actor takes away the mystique because he then has nothing to hide. " // The cynical view of the decision to perform " Carmen " in English is that it is being done to buoy the show at the box office . But Mr. Brook said he had intended to use English lyrics from the opening of the run in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier about Mr. Harnick , who is best known for his lyrics ( with Jerry Bock ' s music ) to " Fiddler on the Roof " and " Fiorello ! " - but who also did a translation of " Carmen " for the Houston Grand Opera in 1981. // While rehearsing " La Tragedie de Carmen " in Paris prior to the New York opening , Mr. Brook commissioned one English translation . He found it intriguing , but difficult for his cast to sing . Shortly after the director commissioned a second translation , Howard Hensel , who plays Don Jose , told him of the Harnick lyrics , which he had sung with the Houston Opera. // Mr. Brook asked to see the lyrics . Mr. Hensel said they were meant to be heard , not read . And he and Cynthia Clarey , a Carmen who also knew the Harnick lyrics , proceeded to serenade the director . By November , Mr. Brook and Alexander Cohen , the producer , had agreed to work with Mr. Harnick. // Although Mr. Brook had vastly redefined the staging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while adding several scenes - he wanted the lyrics to hew closely to tradition . That was fine with Mr. Harnick . " I ' d done a traditional translation for Houston , " he said , " and I was hoping he didn ' t want this updated into ' Carmen Jones ' or something. " // Mr. Harnick has translated Lehar ' s operetta , " The Merry Widow , " and Ravel ' s opera , " The Enchanted Child . " But he considered " Carmen " particularly well-suited to his background in musicals. // " ' Carmen ' is as close to a Broadway show as any opera I know , " he said . " It may be because the two men who wrote the lyrics - Meilhac and Halevy - were also successful boulevard playwrights . While they were writing opera , they were writing popular theater . And it ' s a wonderful story with people who are quite real . ' Carmen ' is less mythic than other operas . So I didn ' t have the problems with it I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carmen " by no means came easily . Mr. Harnick spent 18 months on the lyrics for the Houston production , one month of that on the " Toreador " song alone. // " I first tried to absorb what the scenes were about , what the characters were seeing and feeling , " he said , recalling his working process . " Then I would try to translate literally and see how that fit . It rarely did . Even if the words sounded right , they would usually be a beat or two too long or too short . So then I would have to invent . And it often involved learning every musical phrase and walking around my room or up and down the street , trying to find words to express to that music . It reminded me of when Jerry Bock gives me music for our shows . But then , if I don ' t like an idea I can scrap it . Here , I admire the French so much I try to recreate it. " // Mr. Harnick has spent the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brook ' s departures from the traditional plot . Three weeks ago , he began working with the cast and , last week , with Mr. Brook as well. // Meeting Thursday afternoon , they debated whether to use " come " or " come on , " " be still " or " shut up , " " moved " or " stirred . " The choices turned partly on whether a given word was too colloquial , whether it was in or out of character , but partly on each singer ' s ability to pronounce a certain word or syllable while sustaining a certain note. // At one point , saying that a particular passage was too difficult to sing , Mr. Brook told Mr. Harnick , " This is so dense , it ' s like Bob Dylan lyrics. " // Mr. Harnick has his own worries , too . " Opera singers are so used to singing other languages , " he said , " that they often don ' t worry about projecting the words . They can come out as one endless blur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience expects to hear every word . And I want the audience to hear every word of ' Carmen . ' It ' s such a wonderful story , I think they ' ll love knowing what it is. " //
