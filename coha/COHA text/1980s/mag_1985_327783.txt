Remember what the yuppies did for sales of Saab , Cuisinart , Rolex and Burberry raincoats when those products became their symbols ? Now it is the turn of the sneaker . The young urban professionals have their own : Reebok , a pricey ( $30 to $60 ) , soft-leather shoe that comes in six colors and 40 styles , including a popular high-top model . Says Edward Hurley , an assistant manager at an Athlete 's Foot store in New York City : " All other shoes have been forced to take a back seat to Reeboks . It 's the season 's hottest shoe . " He sold 700 pairs last month . <P> Reeboks come from the unfashionable town of Bolton , England , in depressed Lancashire . The shoe 's manufacturer came into the U.S. market in 1979 , and its products were first picked up by aerobic dancers . They and others especially liked models with a stylish , light leather exterior . The company also promoted Reeboks as a favorite of the dedicated athlete , an image bolstered when Steve Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Marathon , was photographed in a pair of Reeboks . Last year total U.S. sales reached $65 million , up from $3.5 million three years ago . The overall market for athletic and running shoes , in contrast , has been flat .
