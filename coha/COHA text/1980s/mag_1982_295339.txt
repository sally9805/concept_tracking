Nicaragua uses brutal force on its proud , once friendly Indians <P> For weeks , Honduran soldiers stationed across the Coco River from the Nicaraguan village of Leimus watched with mounting concern as Sandinista troops began moving into the bustling town , a stronghold of the country 's independent-minded Miskito Indians . Then , on a moonlit night just before Christmas , the Hondurans began hearing bursts of automatic rifle fire . An Indian mineworker , Roberto Vidal Poveda , 18 , recounted his ordeal to TIME Correspondent James Willwerth , who talked to a number of Miskito refugees : " During the night , the Sandinistas took us out and started to kill us , one by one . They made me stand by the river , but I jumped when they started to shoot . Two bullets hit me in my arm . They shot at me as I swam . I finally reached the other side and lay on the beach until morning . " <P> A local farmer , Orvino Gonzales , 37 , was coming down the Coco River in a boat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was dark , but I saw maybe 15 people taken out of a building and lined up in a launch on the water . The Sandinistas shot them with automatic rifles . The bodies fell into the water . " Two days later the Sandinistas burned houses in Wiwinak , where Gonzales lived . Several miles upstream , the village of San Jeronimo was reduced to ashes . <P> The reported bloodbath in Leimus , in which as many as 50 Miskito Indians were shot or drowned , was part of an operation ordered by the Sandinista high command in Managua to evacuate a zone some 50 miles deep on the Nicaragua-Honduras border from Santa Isabel eastward along the Coco River to the coast . Beginning in mid-December , Sandinista forces evacuated or burned between 25 and 40 Miskito villages , allegedly killed an estimated 200 inhabitants and resettled 8,500 to 10,000 more at internment camps in the Nicaraguan interior near Rosita and Siuna . Reason for the Sandinista campaign : the Miskitos , some of whom fought alongside the Sandinistas to overthrow Nicaraguan Dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even known to have joined forces with anti-Sandinista exiles across the Honduran border . <P> " Everybody has the same story , " said Tom Hawk , the director of the overflowing United Nations-sponsored refugee camp at Mocoron , Honduras . " You hear it again and again . " The camp is in a muddy meadow of thatched lean-tos surrounded by jungle . It has become home for 5,100 Miskito Indians who fled across the border into Honduras . Another 3,000 to 5,000 are expected in coming weeks . Food shipments are infrequent , and many of the refugees had not eaten in three days when Willwerth visited . <P>
