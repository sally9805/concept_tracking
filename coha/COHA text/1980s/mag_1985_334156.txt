Choosing a star to play the late C. and W. Singer Patsy Cline proved a simple gambit : you take the girl out of Country , and you will get a lot of country out of the girl . Jessica Lange , 35 , also got something out of Sweet Dreams , due at theaters in the fall . After a series of roles in which " a lot was internalized , " Lange enjoyed playing someone whose " personality was so external that she held nothing in . " To look as well as emote the part , Lange tucked her blond locks under a series of brunet wigs , and Cline 's mother pronounced Lange " superb " after watching her film a stage singing performance . Movie audiences , however , will only see Lange lip-syncing . The voice belonged to the real Cline.
