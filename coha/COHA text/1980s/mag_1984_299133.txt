In the fall of 1978 , Fran Tate had the notion to open a Mexican restaurant in Barrow , Alaska . She had canvassed the town-there are , if you count the transients , roughly 3,000 people there , 80% of them Eskimos-and Mexican food is what they said they favored , overwhelmingly . The more she thought about it , the more she liked the idea , and one day , in a fit of enterprise , she seized a board , a piece of two-by-four , it being the nearest thing at hand , and drew her plans on it-the kitchen , the dining room seating arrangement , all that . Fran recalls , " I thought , ' Boy , that 's a hot idea , ' and I threw that sucker in my suitcase and flew to Anchorage and went to the bank . " <P> A certain Mr. Peterson at the bank asked , " How much do you want ? " Fran said , " Eighty-seven thousand dollars . " <P> Peterson : " Lady , I ca n't go in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a board , to show them . I need blueprints . " <P> Fran got blueprints . The bank still turned her down . Then ten other banks turned her down . Barrow , dark 24 hours a day in the winter , light 24 hours a day in the summer , treeless , ice-ridden Barrow , lusted for a Mexican restaurant , Fran claims . " So I just overdrew my checking account by $11,000 , wrote a hot check , let a couple of big bills slide and opened Pepe 's North of the Border . " <P> Outside , Pepe 's is not much to look at ; inside , you could be in Nuevo Laredo : serapes , sombreros , paintings of matadors , Mexican waiters . Open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. , it has three dining rooms , 234 seats , and it is usually jammed . Fran plans to expand . <P> Yankee ingenuity is not new to this forbidding part of the world . In the last winter of the 19th century , for example , a prospector named Ed Jesson heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Trouble was , Jesson was over in the Klondike region of Canada , hundreds of miles removed from the strike . He cast about for transportation , found sled dogs in scarce supply and finally bought a bicycle . He made it to Nome in a month , along the way passing an astonished Indian , who , never having encountered a bike , exclaimed , " White man , he set down , walk like hell ! " <P> Fran Tate is cut of similar cloth . Beside her yearbook picture from her high school in Auburn , Wash. , where she held down a newspaper route and set pins in a bowling alley , was written , " By the work one knows the workman . " Fran thought this sketch of her character " was awful . Everyone else 's said , ' To the best-looking girl in school , ' that sort of thing . I thought what a dud I was . " Today she owns a sewage-disposal service in Barrow , as well as a water-delivery service , as well as Pepe 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth of Julys running , she has won , for her age group , an annual Barrow foot race . She is 54 . She has a 24-year-old husband . His name is Juan Ramirez , but everyone calls him Chico . " This is the best of my four marriages , " she says . She has a 30-year-old son in Anchorage- " He 's a narc " - and a 29-year-old son in Barrow , a driver for one of her firms . " They think Chico 's a neat guy . "
