Races from the luxurious new Arlington Park will be shown at rival tracks and off-track betting parlors . After two months of negotiations , Hawthorne President Tom Carey and Stormy Bidwill , president of thoroughbred racing at Sportsman ' s Park , have reached a one-year simulcast agreement with Arlington owner Dick Duchossois . Arlington attorney Tom McCauley said Tuesday the accord covers two disputed areas : - During the June 28-Oct. 15 Arlington meeting , its races will be simulcast to Sportsman ' s , Maywood Park and Balmoral Park and the OTB parlors in the Loop , Rockford and Peoria. - Arlington ' s intertrack facility , Ditka ' s Trackside and its OTB parlor in Waukegan will take bets on the thoroughbred races during the meetings at Sportsman ' s ( Feb. 24-May 27 ) and at Hawthorne ( May 28-June 27 and Oct. 16-Dec. 31 ) . At December ' s meeting of the Illinois Racing Board , Duchossois had threatened to show his races only at his Waukegan parlor and Arlington ' s little sister track , Quad City Downs . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawthorne . Under the agreement that has resolved the dispute , Sportsman ' s and Hawthorne , through June 27 , will give Duchossois a larger share of the handle than the statutory 50-50 formula to help defray the cost of building Ditka ' s Trackside . Last year ' s agreement gave Duchossois an additional 8 percent . Financial details of the new accord have not been released . But both sides said it calls for a subsidy of " less than 8 percent " until July 1 , when the statutory formula will go back into effect . Still unresolved is whether or not Ditka ' s Trackside and the Waukegan parlor will take bets on the Midwest ' s premier harness meeting , June 28-Oct. 15 at Sportsman ' s . " If we keep negotiating , I ' m expecting we ' ll arrive at a solution , " said McCauley . " It ' s a complicated problem . The issue here is that Quad City Downs wants equitable treatment in intertrack and off-track betting . The key is to come up with some solution that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness meeting ) to be viewed by some of the Inter-Track Partners parlors . " Inter-Track Partners is the alliance of the owners of Sportsman ' s , Hawthorne , Maywood and Balmoral who have banded together to jointly operate the aggregate total of eight parlors they are entitled to under the revised racing act passed late in 1986 . The parlors in the Loop , Rockford and Peoria belong to Inter-Track Partners . The Peoria and Rockford parlors were awarded to Inter-Track Partners in 1986 before Duchossois ' acquisition of Quad City Downs early last year . " Right now , Quad City Downs is the only track in the state with no regular OTB outlet , " said McCauley . " When the Dubuque ( Ia. ) dog track opened in 1985 it hurt Quad City Downs badly . And last year , with the parlors operating in Peoria and Rockford , Quad City Downs lost 20 per cent of its handle from 1987 . " Before Arlington agrees to conduct intertrack and off-track betting on this summer ' s harness meeting at Sportsman ' s , this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we ' re not there yet.
