When Ronald Reagan 's doctors announced two years ago that the President suffered from colon cancer , the world also learned that his brother Neil had received the same diagnosis . That apparently incidental detail did not surprise cancer researchers . They have long known that family members can share a genetic predisposition to the disease , but the exact mechanism was a mystery . Last week scientists in Britain and Israel reported in the journal Nature that they had discovered that there is a faulty gene that triggers a rare form of colon cancer and found its general location . The discovery , said Sir Walter Bodmer , director of research at London 's Imperial Cancer Research Fund and a principal investigator , may eventually enable doctors to provide better diagnosis and treatment for all patients with colon cancer , which in the West is the second most deadly form of the disease , after lung cancer . <P> Bodmer 's team studied 13 families with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , a rare hereditary condition affecting adolescents in which the large intestine is carpeted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancerous . After reading about a boy who suffered from several disorders , including FAP , that seemed linked to a missing portion of chromosome No. 5 , * the researchers hypothesized that all FAP victims lack the same genetic material . They were right . Afflicted patients had the chromosome defects ; healthy ones did not . The scientists further postulated that a person with FAP inherits from one parent a healthy gene that deters polyp growth and from the other a faulty gene . Over time even the healthy gene becomes inactive , allowing tumors to form . <P> Yet FAP accounts for less than 1% of the 170,000 new cases of colorectal cancerdiagnosed in the U.S. and Britain each year . That led Bodmer to ask , " Could the same gene be involved in the normal run of colon cancers ? " The researchers analyzed tumors removed from 45 patients with common colorectal cancer . Result : the section of chromosome 5 that contains the FAP gene was missing in more than 25% of the cases . The finding suggested that such cancers occur only after one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Gastroenterologist Sidney Winawer , of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City : " This gives us a better idea of where to look for a genetic cause of colon cancer . " <P> Should researchers pinpoint that genetic defect , the next step will be to develop a simple diagnostic test . Doctors now recommend that everyone over 50 periodically undergo routine , if unpleasant , examinations with a proctosigmoidoscope , a hollow , lighted tube that is inserted in the colon to look for signs of cancer . A blood test that could alert people that they carried a greater risk of developing colorectal cancer might motivate them to seek frequent checkups . <P> " Obviously the hope must be that as we learn how the gene works , we can use that to find new ways of treatment , " says Bodmer . Indeed , researchers speculate that some remedies may be fairly simple : a diet high in fiber and calcium , for example , may prevent or compensate for these genetic deficiencies . <P> FOOTNOTE : *Pairs of human chromosomes are assigned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
