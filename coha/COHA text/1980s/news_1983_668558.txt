For 8000 years , Scratch Flat has yielded its bounty . At first , Indians gathered edible weeds , such as goosefoot . They hunted elk and fished amid the duckweed , loosestrife and rushes in Beaver Brook . Then , for a millenium of harvest moons , rows of corn , squash and beans planted by the first Indian farmers , and , later , apples and hay , cauliflower and celery , filled this arable square mile here in Middlesex County . Through war , revolution , industrialization and depression , farming held Scratch Flat residents to the land . Now , a good part of it is being used to harvest what some see as the cash-crop of the future . Information . The new tenants , wooed by town officials to the Beaver Brook Industrial Park , have names such as Masscomp , Telequip and Uniserv . Instead of farmhouses and barns , they occupy squat , pre-fabricated , warehouse-style buildings . Their products are words and data , the design of satellite components and microcomputers . The geometry of crops has given way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tractor to the clack of keyboard . Elsewhere on Scratch Flat , new split-level houses , most of them owned by workers in the high-tech firms popping up along Rte. 495 , set where bushels of beans once grew . The transition , while dramatic , is hardly unique . A revolution in work and land-use has been changing the face of rural America for years . This is the tale of one small corner of Massachusetts , a tale explored by a man who lives on it . John H. Mitchell , editor of Massachusetts Audobon Society publications , wrote a book to try to puzzle out the meaning , symbolic or real , of the change . Through a blend of paleontology , anthropology , archeology , and numerous trips across its terraced fields , he traced the land ' s history back to the last glacial retreat , when Paleo Indians migrated across its tundra- like heather and rolling moors in pursuit of wooly mammoths and caribou . To Mitchell , the land is a lens through which to view the scope of human habitation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it ' s all over America , " says Mitchell , 43 , a land-use specialist . It draws symbolic power , and , he says , a spiritual energy , from the length of time humans have lived on it , farmed and nurtured it . " After 8000 years of being involved in some kind of food production , from gathering berries to market gardening , it ' s suddenly being used in the transfer of information . That ' s a revolutionary moment . " His book , to come out in May , is not a yearning for the past , he says , but a means " to understand our voyage through time . " " Right here was Cobble ' s hill ( the site of an Indian crop storage pit* , " Mitchell said standing behind one of the high-tech firms in the 8-year-old park off Rte. 119 near both Beaver Brook and Rte. 495 . It was a bright autumn day , a breeze stirring cattail marshes and rustling corn in the last working farms on Scratch Flat . Woodland Indians cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with farming tribes in western North America . Earlier Indian habitants had gathered wild vegetation before them . And , as far back as 12,000 years ago , migratory-predator s hunted on the same site . As Scratch Flat ' s inhabitants became more tied to the cycle of sowing and reaping , says Mitchell , their spiritual lives deepened . " Time has come full circle , if you consider high-tech firms the new migratory-predators . It ' s a transient business . The computer workers I ' ve talked to aren ' t aware of how long this land was involved in the making of food . What they do can be done anywhere , they don ' t have to be on this particular piece of arable land . . . . It makes you wonder , do you need a Scratch Flat , a sense of place , to survive ? I don ' t have any easy answers , but I am worried that you can ' t eat information . " Mitchell lives in an old farmhouse on Beaver Brook road , near orchards gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , a pond and freshwater marsh . The stone walls and deserted fields tell a story of Scratch Flat ' s past , he says , as clearly as his newest neighbor speaks of the present . The latest arrival is a low-slung building , set quietly in the woods , which produces frequency synthizers to radio boost signals from space . " For about 10,000 years , the people who lived here needed the land , " Mitchell said in the parking lot . " Now , not one of these companies has any need for Scratch Flat itself . They could as easily be in Tucson . It isn ' t just hayfields that are being lost , but an entire mythology and culture , a way of looking at land in more than economic terms . The Indians believed their spirits were here . The question it makes you ask is what kind of roots we need to survive . " Mitchell began to piece together the history of Scratch Flat ( a term used mostly in the 19th century ) from talks with local farmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth sciences and anthropology to understand its more remote past ; a bog boring by paleontologists , for example , confirmed that deciduous vegetation came to Scratch Flat about 8000 years ago - and with it the beginning of food gathering . That past is not always remote . One recent morning , Mitchell saw three people gathering rushes in the marsh , cutting the stalks of long , round- stemmed grass with sickles and tying them in bundles . They said they were Wamponoag Indians from Mashpee and that they wove baskets with the rushes . " It was the oldest form of work in the New World , " said Mitchell . " This is something people were doing ( here probably 5000 years ago , and are still doing , right next to the industrial park . " Farming on Scratch Flat is not yet a thing of the past . Paula Theodoros Cruz , 23 , is trying to make a go of the 70-acre Springdell Farm , owned by only five families since 1710 .
