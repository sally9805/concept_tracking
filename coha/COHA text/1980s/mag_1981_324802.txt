A troubled group 's new head <P> The National Council of Churches was born in Cleveland in 1950 with a blizzard raging outside the hall , but with sizzling enthusiasm coming from the 4,000 delegates inside . Last week the weather in Cleveland was warmer , but the social and religious climate had turned chilly as the N.C.C . celebrated a belated 30th anniver sary and mulled its many woes . The loudly trumpeted " Ecumenical Event " was supposed to draw 2,000-plus clergy and lay leaders . Instead , only 900 showed up . <P> For years the N.C.C . has appeared to be little more than the Americans for Democratic Action at prayer , parroting a liberal political line . Appropriately , its newest antagonist is the Institute on Religion and Democracy , an ecclesiastical clone of the secular neoconservative movement . The I.R.D. 's leader , a Meth odist minister , charged last week that the N.C.C . is " captive to a left-wing philosophy which is not compatible with what most members of local churches believe . " <P> The N.C.C . is facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million members , which covers most Orthodox adherents but only 52% of U.S. <P> Protestants . The Roman Catholic Church is not a member . Nor is the moderate American Lutheran Church , which has invited heads of 89 denominations to consider forming a broader church council . <P> In need of fresh leadership , the N.C.C . <P> chose Methodist Bishop James Armstrong of Indiana for a three-year term as president . Strong-willed and outspoken , Armstrong , 57 , is the sort of burly , smiling , old-fashioned doer who can wrangle with opponents while magically retaining their affection . <P> Armstrong surfaced nationally in 1958 as pastor of a 3,200-member , all-white In dianapolis church in a racially mixed area . Battling some of his own parishioners , he integrated blacks and whites . By 1968 , attendance and Sunday school enrollment were at alltime highs . Becoming bishop in the Dakotas , he helped prevent a bloody massacre in 1973 by acting as a mediator when Indians took hostages at Wounded Knee . He also be friended Senator George McGovern , even campaigning for him . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critics a few points but lauded the council 's past record and said it would be " irresponsible " to trim or scuttle social programs . " The ecumenical movement is not a lark any more , " he later said . " It is hard , demanding business . "
