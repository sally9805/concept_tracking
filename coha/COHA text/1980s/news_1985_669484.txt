It was a moving moment . With the birth of her second child only two months away , the woman had reluctantly agreed to an abortion after months of visits from officials urging her to obey China ' s radical new policy of one child to a couple. // Shown months later on European television in 1983 , and later in the United States on PBS , the scene - as well as the documentary - had a powerful impact . It convinced many viewers , legislators , and government officials that the Chinese policy was coercive. // // Together with allegations made in a book by US academic Steven Mosher and three articles by former Washington Post correspondent Michael Weisskopf , the documentary ignited a controversy in Washington that is still very much alive. // The US Congress has already withheld $10 million from the United Nations population agency that helps China in census-taking and research and threatens to withhold as much as $38 million , or one-quarter of the agency ' s budget , in fiscal 1986. // The dispute raises fundamental issues about the one-couple-one-child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control record population growth rates . Is the program coercive ? If so , is it the concern of any other country ? Should China be that radical , introducing a policy that , for example , in India and in Africa ( two other third-world areas with high growth rates ) would be unthinkable ? // What will happen as more and more Chinese earn higher incomes because of Deng Xiaoping ' s new decentralized , free-market economic reforms , and feel they can afford a second ( or third ) child ? // The BBC film , entitled ' ' China ' s Child ' ' and shown in November 1983 in Britain , illustrates crucial areas of controversy . It portrayed the wife of a well-to-do farmer very much wanting a second child . It showed local officials visiting her daily to persuade her not to have it. // She resisted until the seventh month of her pregnancy . Then came the televised moment when she gave in and left the house in tears to have the abortion. // The Chinese , sources say , liked the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the time when President Reagan made his April 1984 visit to Peking . American right-to-life groups reacted strongly and many Americans who , until then , had no strong feelings either for or against abortion were upset by the way the woman was treated. // Concerned about the criticism , the Chinese began to criticize the film and the way it was made. // During a recent tour of China , this correspondent was twice told what officials say really happened . Their version was that the BBC pleaded to be able to shoot some abortion footage . The woman it showed had one child who was retarded . She hesitated over having the second child because she feared that it , too , might not be fully normal . Finally , the Chinese say , the woman decided against the second child , but the BBC chose to show her succumbing to pressure and not to mention the condition of the first child. // The BBC strongly disputes this version . In London , a BBC spokesman replied that ' ' The woman clearly expressed to us her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , she could afford to have two children. ' ' // The crew ' ' had no way of knowing whether her son had mental problems or not , ' ' the spokesman said , ' ' but he looked and acted normally . No one told us there was anything untoward about him. ' ' // One difficult area is the exact definition of ' ' coercion ' ' in a communal , Confucian society like China ' s , where people are amenable to higher authority . Deng himself has told UN officials that the one-couple-one-child policy is urgently necessary to avoid shortages of food , housing , schools , transport , jobs , and health care . Besides , he has said , the policy would apply for two generations only. // Other officials conceded to me that local cases of coerced abortion and sterilization had occurred . They agreed that some zealous local officials could have converted target numbers into fixed and mandatory quotas . But they denied that the Chinese policy was to ' ' coerce ' ' anyone . Rather , it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // Western residents of Peking say the line between coercion and persuasion can easily be blurred. // ' ' Local officials , not educated , may oversimplify , ' ' said one Western official . ' ' Maybe they don ' t explain policy very well. ' ' // In fact , the desire to conform is believed to be so strong that people living in the overcrowded cities have apparently followed the government ' s lead . In one housing development in Shanghai , for example , more than 90 percent of births now are first children . One female worker in Shanghai told a member of our touring group that she and other mothers had to visit a local hospital once every two months . Any sign of a second pregnancy meant she was expected to terminate it then and there. // Details were unclear . The woman did not say how easy it might be to defy official ' ' advice ' ' and have the second child . It does appear that a great number of young couples in urban areas are now agreeing to having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care , more living space , and other benefits that vanish if a second child is born. // It also was not clear whether the hospital checks were confined to the Shanghai area , or were to be found further afield . But Reagan administration officials say flatly that ' ' coercion is the fact ' ' in China. // At the urging of , among others , Rep. Jack Kemp ( R ) of New York and Sen. Jesse Helms ( R ) of North Carolina , the officials say , all US money to the UN Fund for Population Activities will be halted in fiscal 1986 unless China radically changes course . Chinese officials , this newspaper learned , considered changing some aspects of policy , but finally decided in November to go on as before . Their line is to respond to US criticisms but not to be deterred by them. // Officials denied that many cases of coercion existed . They gave no specific examples . They were more prepared to respond to questions about female infanticide , which occurs in other third world countries as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1982 , 1983 , 1983 , and early this year . Sentences ranged from 13 years to six months. // // Third of several reports from a recent eight-city tour of China. // // // //
