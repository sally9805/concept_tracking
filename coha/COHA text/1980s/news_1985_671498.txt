According to Jack Killorin , the bureau ' s chief of public affairs , approximately 1 , 350 cases of contaminated German wine were imported into the United States . Bureau officials said the wine was handled by a single importer ; they would not release the importer ' s name. // Mr. Killorin said the importer recalled the tainted wine from his distributors as soon as the contamination was discovered . " Most of it , " he said , " is out of circulation . " Mr. Alford said the wine had been distributed in northern Virginia and an undetermined number of other states. // According to Mr. Alford , the bureau began testing German wines at random - literally pulling bottles off shelves around the country - because the West German Government had told United States authorities that some tainted German wines had been found in that country . Even though the West Germans had assured the bureau that the wines had not been exported to the United States , Mr. Alford said , " We thought we should double-check. " // Dot Koester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both German and Austrian wines is expected to continue for several weeks . The agency is still advising consumers not to drink Austrian wines until testing has been completed . There is no such warning for German wines. // In West Germany , authorities have found 44 different labels of West German wines - all of them expensive , sweet , white dessert wines , mostly of the Auslese and Beerenauslese varieties produced in limited quantities - to be contaminated with diethylene glycol , a poisonous chemical used in some antifreezes. // Large quantities of Austrian wine are exported to West Germany and bottled there . According to Wilhelm Schopen , agriculture counselor at the West German Embassy , the producers of the contaminated West German wines are also importers of Austrian wine. // " The assumption , " he said , " is that the contamination might have happened during the bottling process , " with the German wines passing through the same machinery used to bottle tainted Austrian wines . Mr. Schopen added , however , that authorities are investigating whether the contamination could have resulted from West German producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility , " he said , " can not be excluded. " // The contaminated wines were produced by five wineries , two of them major producers , said Ludolf Engelbrechten , an agricultural attache at the West German Embassy . The largest of the five wineries , which produced more than half the wines , sells directly to consumers , according to Mr. Schopen. // " To the best of our knowledge , none of this wine has reached the United States , " Mr. Schopen said. // The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms also " has no indication of a widespread identifiable problem with the West German wines , " said Mr. Killorin . But he added that should more contaminated German wine be found in the United States , the bureau would issue consumer alerts. // Austrian wines account for only a small percentage of wines imported into this country . According to Miss Koester , there are approximately 1 , 500 Austrian labels available in the United States , of which some 200 have been tested by the agency . West German wines make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with about 100 , 000 German labels available here . After testing about 70 of them , the agency found traces of diethylene glycol only in one brand. // Austrian authorities learned in April that local wines were contaminated . In the United States , however , the first tainted bottles of Austrian wine were not discovered until mid-July , at which time the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms warned American consumers that diethylene glycol may cause nausea , kidney dysfunction or even death if ingested in large enough quantities . No deaths or serious illnesses have yet been reported , according to the agency. // Forty-seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident . According to Mr. Greinert , the Austrian press counselor , there may be further arrests. // Those arrested include wine producers , chemical advisers to the wineries and some wine traders who apparently mixed wines . The larger , famous wine producers have not been implicated , Mr. Greinert said . Rather , most of those arrested are connected with " smaller wineries who wanted to enrich themselves quickly , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase their sweetness so that they could be sold as higher-priced varieties. // Both the Austrian and German Governments are testing their wines and are in frequent contact with American authorities . The Austrian Parliament is to convene in special session Thursday to devise stricter wine laws . The laws are expected to include production , export and labeling reforms , Mr. Greinert said . " Steps are being taken to reinstate confidence in Austrian wines , " he said. // The Austrian Cabinet today agreed on a strict new wine production law that it will submit to Parliament Thursday . Chancellor Fred Sinowatz called the proposal , which provides for a detailed system of checking and labeling wine , the toughest in Europe . " We need this strict wine law to have absolute control and to guarantee the quality of our wines , " he said . Thousands of wine growers , who waited outside Mr. Sinowatz ' s office for the announcement , said the proposal would be disastrous for business. // The West German Government is demanding that all Austrian wine be imported only in bottles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discovery of the tainted brands in this country , American officials are requiring importers and wholesale distributors to have their Austrian wines tested before any is sold . No such test is being required for German wines . If a distributor ' s test for contamination is positive , he must send that wine to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms for confirmation . The agency ' s advice to a consumer who has a bottle of Austrian wine is to return it to the retailer . The retailer should then return the wine to the distributor. // The amount of diethylene glycol found in the tainted Austrian wines thus far ranges from 0. 01 to 16 grams per liter . About 0. 1 gram per liter was found in the tainted German wine. //
