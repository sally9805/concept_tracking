The name Galileo commonly symbolizes the wisdom of science against the foolishness of the Roman Catholic Church . He is seen as the martyr representing freedom while his accusers are portrayed as the cold authoritarians . But the picture is changing. // A new debate over the causes and meaning of the 17th-century dispute was evident at a conference of science historians at the University of Wisconsin last week . Several views were expressed , sometimes heatedly , suggesting that Galileo had been an eccentric publicity seeker , driven by arrogance ; that the church ' s response was not only defensible but inevitable , under rules even Galileo agreed should apply ; that Galileo ' s condemnation had indeed been an atrocity , poisoning relations between faith and reason ever since. // The dust has never really settled over the controversy , but recent scholarly and ecclesiastical factors have revived interest in the drama and the results could have an important bearing on efforts to better understand how science and religion have influenced each other over the ages. // Among the major stimulants was the decision last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with a view toward reversing or perhaps softening the church ' s judgment against him . The Pope is believed to want to resolve the issue by 1983 , the 350th anniversary of the condemnation , in the interests of lessening tensions between science and religion which stem in part from the denunciation of Galileo . Despite his struggles , Galileo remained a Catholic until his death and , according to one church specialist the Pope , disturbed at what he regards as the association of science and atheism , would welcome a rehabilitated Galileo who could be seen as both a believer and a legendary scientist . <> <> Nonintellectual Factors Count // Though the Galileo trial has often been seen as ushering in a conflict between science and religion that extends to the present day , it is one of many religion-science episodes receiving increasing attention from scholars attempting to include social , economic and political components in their studies . Largely because the inclusion of these factors has become more common , the longstanding issues between scientists and the church have become somewhat less attributable to inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other historical factors. // Aware of that trend , organizers of the conference have their sights set on publicizing a book from the proceedings , hoping to establish a more comprehensive and positive tone for the interaction between theology and science from earliest Christian times . The aim is to replace the largely negative theme of the most substantial previous book on the subject , " The Warfare of Science and Theology , " published in 1896 by Andrew D. White. // Galileo is due to occupy an important place in that historical review as a complex figure caught in the midst of revolutions in both science and religion . <> <> Was Galileo Right but Wrong ? // The re-examination of his case could strongly influence the effort to recast the history of science . Galileo ' s situation contains several key elements which fostered antagonisms long afterwards , including doubts about the authority of the Bible and the issue of intellectual freedom under church authority . It has become more difficult to assign virtue and blame for the incident itself . Though Galileo ' s basic conclusions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his claim scientifically , though he had agreed that such evidence must be supplied if scientific theories appeared to contradict the scriptures . And the question remains whether the debate was principally a contest of ideas or personalities . Galileo and his principal adversary , Robert Cardinal Bellarmine , were both determined , headstrong and renowned. // Opposing world views were pitted against each other . Science represented a new way of seeing creation and the place of human beings in the universe . The Catholic Church , having emerged shaken and cautious from the challenges of the Reformation , accurately perceived this movement as another potential threat. // Though he has been popularly seen as a genius and a victim of a repressive institution , the crisis Galileo faced takes on a less decisive character when scrutinized by the growing scope of research methods. // In 1610 , Galileo looked through his new device , the telescope , and on the basis of his findings began to try to prove the accuracy of Copernicus ' theory that the earth turned on its axis and revolved around the sun . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ptolemy , that the earth was at the center of the solar system and church authorities used the Bible to support the claim . <> <> Motives Didn ' t Matter // Finally Galileo was tried and found guilty on the ground that he refused to accept the church ' s interpretation of the Bible . In a formal sense , the fact that his scientific views had led him to doubt scripture was technically incidental. // Beyond the most obvious facts emerge a variety of analyses of the behavior of Galileo and his opponents . Prof. Robert S. Westman of the University of California at Los Angeles emphasized the social and political strategy Galileo used to try to win his case . According to Professor Westman , Galileo moved from Venice to Florence in order to gain a better political foothold for the battle he expected with the Vatican. // " He had the telescope , " Professor Westman said , " and he felt he could knock them over . He was filled with overestimation of how far he could push his claims. " // Another participant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical of the church ' s actions . " The condemnation of Galileo , " Professor Shey wrote in a paper prepared for the conference , " dealt the Roman Catholic Church a blow from which it has never fully recovered . Embarrassed or perhaps merely annoyed , Catholic historians have shunned the topic of the connection between the Catholic faith and the rise of modern science . " Since that time , Professor Shey said , the church had lived " under a cloud . " <> <> The Vatican Defended // The strongest attack on that position came from the Rev. William A. Wallace , a professor of history at Catholic University and a specialist in Galileo . Father Wallace argued that the Vatican had acted within its rights by demanding that Galileo prove his case. // Though Galileo supported theories which were eventually born out , according to Father Wallace , he never came up with evidence that scientifically validated his claims . His principal arguments were based on the movement of ocean tides and paths followed by sunspots - and were wrong . Galileo himself had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by scientific proof . The Inquisition , in finding him guilty , could therefore insist that he had failed by his own standards. // " The church ' s authoritarian stance forced scientists to be responsible in their claims , " Father Wallace said . " It is to the credit of the Inquisition that they did not let Galileo get away with it . The church authorities overreacted , but that is no reason to canonize Galileo . Human beings were involved on both sides . Certainly Galileo ' s behavior was not beyond reproach. " // All of which poses a dilemma for the Vatican . Father Wallace , who has followed carefully the reopening of Galileo ' s file , sees no easy solution , given the church ' s original decision based indirectly on the absence of scientific evidence . At the same time , the Pope is showing a conciliatory mood . Should the church exonerate Galileo for expounding the truth without adequate demonstration ? " The two congregations handling this , " Father Wallace said , " have been tossed a hot potato. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
