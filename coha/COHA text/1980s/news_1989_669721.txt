' ' We thought we were on a real roll with China , and look what happened . . . . Now , our 35-year relationship with Japan takes on more importance , ' ' says an influential US official with a sigh. // US relations with China have been deeply fractured by China ' s brutal crackdown on dissent . Now the US is taking stock of other ties in the region . It is finding that its chief alliance in Asia , and one of its most important in the world - its relationship with Japan - needs shoring up. // // The reasons are complex and varied , but most are grounded in the lopsided economic relationship between the two countries. // In recent years , the US has been running $50 billion to $70 billion annual trade deficit with Japan . The US has cited Japan for unfair trade practices , and is entering yet again into negotiations to break down Japanese trade barriers . If those talks are not successful , the result could be specific economic sanctions against Japan. // In recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been aimed at one symbol : a joint US-Japanese project to develop a new fighter aircraft - the FSX - for Japan ' s Air Self-Defense Forces. // A House of Representatives debate on the FSX agreement last week produced extraordinarily harsh rhetoric - rhetoric more appropriate to an adversarial relationship rather than an alliance . Member after member decried Japan ' s economic moves , calling them untrustworthy , ruthless , and unfit for a US military ally . Japan was simply out to crush US industries , in the view of many. // ' ' Have we bought any US-made TVs , or cameras , or VCRs lately ? Think about that , ' ' said Rep. Dan Burton ( R ) of Indiana. // MEMORIES of World War II were invoked , sometimes subtly , once with startling directness . Rep. James Traficant Jr. , an outspoken Democrat from a still-depressed Ohio steel district , began by wondering if ' ' Mutual of Tokyo ' ' was going to cross the Pacific to write policies on Americans ' Toyotas . Then he let fly : ' ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies laying in Arlington today that are rolling over in their graves because they thought they won a war , ' ' he said. // Such words by no means reflect a majority House opinion . But on June 7 the House passed a measure , previously approved by the Senate , putting strings on Japan ' s use of FSX technology . The measure will likely be vetoed by President Bush , and Congress will not be able to override the veto. // But many just wanted to register displeasure with what they see as State Department softness on Japan . Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R ) of California said he felt ' ' we have someone like Peewee Herman doing our negotiating. ' ' // Administration officials point out that the FSX deal was a US idea . The Japanese originally leaned toward developing the new fighter on their own . Congress , for all its bluster , did not try to stop the FSX project entirely. // ' ' I don ' t think ( harsh congressional rhetoric ) is a common or majority view , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is troubling that it is being heard in Congress - and echoed by others. // ' ' It is very disappointing that some of this language is carried by the media , and taken at face value , ' ' a Japanese source says . ' ' These words are emotional and simplistic . They aren ' t constructive at all. ' ' // But they may well reflect what the US voting public thinks . Recent polls indicate Americans have come to see economic competition as a greater threat than military power . Last year , for example , the ' ' Americans Talk Security ' ' polling project found that 56 percent of respondents judged ' ' economic competitors like Japan ' ' a greater threat to US national security than ' ' military adversaries like the Soviet Union. ' ' // But the Japanese people - aside from Japan ' s perceived national goals - did not engender harsh feelings among those polled . And despite the growing warmth of US-Soviet relations , Japan has not replaced the Soviet Union as the image of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of respondents said they had a favorable impression of Japan. // William Gleysteen , head of the Japan Society based in New York , says there does seem to be a new edge to congressional rhetoric about Japan . His ' ' macro-historical ' ' explanation is that the US man on the street sees America being challenged by a new economic rival , and ' ' it hurts , in psychological and practical terms. ' ' // The public does not see an easy resolution of problems now dogging the American economy , Mr. Gleysteen says . The judgment that economic competitors are now the largest threat to national security ' ' involves a great deal of self-doubt on the part of Americans , ' ' he says. // Congressional complaints about Japan could also harden attitudes in Tokyo . The Japanese government , after all , has for its part not been famous for sensitivity in dealing with trade and international economic issues. // ' ' This could have serious consequences . Japan is not going to lie down and play the role of whipping boy , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Center for Strategic and International Studies. // Administration officials fear the US-Japan military relationship will now take a back seat to economic concerns . Transferring weapons technology may become increasingly difficult politically , analogous to the difficulty selling arms to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. // Aside from the FSX controversy , Congress last year was also critical of an administration proposal to sell Aegis radar technology to Japan . Japanese officials have expressed interest in AWACS airborne radar technology as well , but one US official says he would now be skittish about such a sale. // ' ' There is no way you can ignore congressional and public opinion about Japan , ' ' says the official , who works on Japan-US military relations . Events in China are a wild card in US-Japan relations . In the short term there is probably little that either country can do to push the Beijing regime toward a more moderate line . But China ' s sudden lurch backward could show Washington and Tokyo who their friends really are , Asia specialists in the US say. // ' ' We ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the proper perspective lately , ' ' says Gaston Sigur , former US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs . ' ' We ought to press ( the Japanese government ) hard , but we have to recognize the many ways in which we work together , ' ' he adds. // //
