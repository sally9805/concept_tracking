Refugees on the rampage <P> It began innocently enough when a few Cubans lit a fire to make coffee . Military police moved in and doused the flames , telling the refugees that open fires were outlawed on the Army base at Fort Chaffee , Ark . A small incident , but last week it ignited the resentment that had been smoldering in some of the 19,000 Cuban refugees from Castro awaiting relocation in the U.S. A force of 500 Cubans marched out through the front gate before being rounded up by harassed soldiers and police . That night 200 Cubans tried to storm the gates . Repelled , they staged a full-scale riot and set mess halls and supply rooms ablaze . Police and soldiers broke up the rampage with tear gas , but small mobs roamed the base starting more fires and demanding freedom . <P> The cry was ironic , for liberty was precisely what the hard-pressed federal officials running the camp were trying to give the refugees-and as swiftly as possible . But the sheer magnitude of the task , plus some inexcusable lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people who had expected to be quickly reunited with their families on American soil . The result was yet another frustrating incident in the long chain of false starts and policy shifts that have marked the U.S. treatment of the Cubans . <P> The problem began when 112,000 Cubans arrived in the space of 48 days-a logistical nightmare that flummoxed the Federal Emergency Management Agency , the bureau charged with coordinating the resettlement process . Says William Combs , chief spokesman for the FEMA : " We had to set up while it was still happening . " One key problem turned out to be a communications snafu between the federal agency and the private organizations that find homes for the refugees after they are cleared . The Immigration and Naturalization Service had approved 4,000 Fort Chaffee refugees for resettlement after concluding that they were not criminals . Simultaneously , the U.S. Catholic Conference , one of the main private agencies involved in the operation , had compiled a list of 4,735 people who had homes awaiting them . But the two lists did not match . Not until last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities begin to work together more effectively . In all , some 57,000 Cubans have been resettled from the camps , but officials anticipate that it will take months to process the remaining ones . <P> Last week , Carter ordered the Justice Department to try to send back to Cuba those who have serious criminal records or have violated U.S. law . Carter 's order may well affect the 125 Cubans who led the riot ; at week 's end 60 of them were being transferred to a detention center in El Paso for trial in a federal court . To keep order in the Fort Chaffee camp , Carter tripled the federal troops to 2,000 . But White House Press Secretary Jody Powell took care to note that " the vast majority " were not involved in the violence .
