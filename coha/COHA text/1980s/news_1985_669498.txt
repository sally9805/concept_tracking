The government , news media , and probably the majority of Poles reject the movie ' s implicit accusation that many Poles condoned the Nazi annihilation of Jews in the extermination camps - all situated on Polish territory . But not all Poles condemn the film. // ' ' Shoah , ' ' by French Jewish director Claude Lanzmann , consists of present-day interviews with survivors , witnesses , and a few perpetrators of the mass murder of Jews in World War II . In long segments shot in Poland , one or two peasants living near Auschwitz , Treblinka , and other death camps burst into tears at their memories . But many more express undis-// // guised hostility toward Jews. // In Warsaw a sampling of elite Polish reaction to ' ' Shoah ' ' ( ' ' Holocaust ' ' in Hebrew ) a few weeks after a 11/2-hour excerpt of it appeared on TV runs like this : // ' ' It ' s lies . ' ' It ' s unfair because ' ' it shows only one area of Poland , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ' t blame the Poles for what Germans did in the death camps . . . . In their long history Poles never persecuted the Jews the way Russians and Germans did . . . . I hate the French . Better to have a true enemy ( the Germans ) than a false friend ' ' ( like the French film director ) . // ' ' It ' s one-sided . It doesn ' t say that Poles did save Jews , especially children , some of them in monasteries . Remember , it took six or seven Poles to save one Jew . And Poland was the only country where there was a death penalty ( imposed by the Germans ) for helping Jews . . . . We acknowledge the victimization of the Jews . They don ' t acknowledge our victimization. ' ' // ' ' It was boring. ' ' // ' ' The Russians dumped their Jews here . They played one against the other . They took property away from Poles after the uprising of 1863 and gave it to Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // ' ' I don ' t think ( Shoah ) blamed all Polish people . It ' s a work of art . He ( the director ) can chose what he wants . But it did leave some things out. ' ' // ' ' There ' s been a lot written about it here , including one ( Roman ) Catholic newspaper which had a good sober article about the church then . It was a medieval church . It believed the Jews were guilty of the crucifixion. ' ' // ' ' You should read a letter in Przeglad Tygodniowy by Prof. ( of history ) Jendruszczak . He insisted that they print one paragraph they had cut out of an article of his they published . It talked about Jews in the east in 1939 who collaborated ' ' and weren ' t loyal to Poland . ' ' The letter didn ' t say so , but that was the Soviet-occupied part of Poland ' ' after the Stalin-Hitler pact repartitioned Poland . ' ' ( The film ) shows primitive people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is not right . It ( the anti-Polish slant of the film ) is not accidental . There are anti-Semites everywhere , but the director wanted to single out Poland. ' ' // The people commenting included writers , journalists , politicians , and professors present at two receptions in the runup to the December 13 anniversary of the outlawing of Solidarity and imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981 . All had seen the excerpt of Shoah on TV . The last speaker - Szymon Szurmiej , a member of parliament and artistic director of the Jewish State Theater in Poland - had also seen the full 91/2-hour version , which is now playing in a Warsaw cinema . Mr. Szurmiej ' s entire family and some 200 other relatives died in the Holocaust . He himself escaped to the East and fought with the Soviet-backed partisans there. // All of the Poles who were asked reflected the history of a Polish-Jewish relationship that is as anguished as German-Jewish or German-Polish relations . Unlike the German aggressors and losers of World War II , the Poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harrowing question of complicity and guilt for the Holocaust . One German resident in Warsaw strongly contested the disavowals of anti-Semitism by Poles ; he expressed amazement at the everyday anti-Semitism he encounters in such things as automatically blaming a supposed Jewish landlord when break-ins occur. // Some 3 million Polish Jews were murdered in the Holocaust . An additional 3 million European Jews were killed in the extermination camps and Nazi SS massacres , and an additional 3 million non-Jewish Poles were killed in the German occupation . An unimaginable 11 million out of the total 18 million Nazi victims of all nationalities died in the occupied Polish lands , according to historian Norman Davies . The Jews suffered the most of any race under the Nazis , the Poles the most of any nation . Before the war there were 3. 35 million Jews in Poland . After the war only 369 , 000 still survived , most of these in the Polish areas subsequently incorporated into the Soviet Union . ' ' Today , after further emigration , Poland has only a few thousand Jews left. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial insistence that the French government remove Shoah from French television , and even authorized its release to Polish TV and cinemas ? ' ' Because they know people won ' t like it , ' ' suggests one writer - and the film might therefore win sympathy for the government against Western critics of Poland. // In a thoughtful review of Shoah in the current New York Review of Books , British journalist Timothy Garton Ash praises the film as a stunning and haunting accomplishment . He then offers severe judgments that clearly trouble him , however , as an admirer of Solidarity and the Poles on the one hand and of Shoah on the other. // His first observation is that the Roman Catholic Church in Poland never has squarely dealt with the Holocaust or taught its peasant parishioners that superstitious anti-Semitism and the entire persecution of Jews was and is wrong . He sees a glimmer of hope in the government ' s new encouragement of Polish-Jewish studies ( even if for ulterior motives ) , in the moral support of the pope for a real examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turowicz ' s new admission that there was widespread anti-Semitism in Poland between the wars , that this was partly rooted in religion , and that there is still a ' ' reckoning of conscience ' ' to be made. // A second reflection Ash ' s is that the intense nationalism of these two cruelly victimized peoples , the Poles and the Jews , all too often excludes compassion for the other. // A third point made by Ash is that if Lanzmann is searching for truth , as he stresses , then he should acknowledge that some Poles did in fact brave the German terror to help Jews , and paid with their own lives. // A fourth , more abstract , conclusion is that while artistry is indispensable for understanding , so is history , with its clash of interpretations and challenge of factual material to establish truth. // As for historians , some dispute both the Poles ' bland denial of anti-Semitism and the attribution of especially virulent anti-Semitism to the Poles by the large Polish Jewish diaspora in the US and Israel . Norman Davies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an account of Poland over the past two centuries , notes that four-fifths of world Jewry found refuge in Poland in the 19th century . Poland was the first nation to grant the Jews full citizenship . Nor were there the government-instigated pogroms and persecutions in Poland that there were in Russia . ( Here Davies contests the standard Jewish understanding of Polish history. ) // As romantic nationalism swept Europe in the 19th century the patriotism and sense of martyred messianism of both Poles and Jews were initially viewed as mutually reinforcing . When the Rising of 1863 was suppressed , however , the two became hostile , blaming each other for the failure . Assimilation lost its attraction. // The material lot of Jews declined . The Jews split into factions . Many were radicalized , some becoming Zionists ( like future Israeli premiers David Ben Gurion and Menachim Begin ) , others becoming socialists or communists ( like Rosa Luxemburg and eventual Soviet Commissar of Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov ) . Antipathy grew between Poles and Jews ( as it did between Poles and Ukrainians , Germans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period secular Jews were prominent in the Stalinist government in Poland , and traditional Polish hatred of the Russian overlord reinforced anti-Semitism at that point . Much later , Jewish intellectuals figured in liberalization movements in 1968 and to some extent as Solidarity advisers in 1980-81 . At different times , then , anti-Semitism became a handy tool for mobilizing popular resentment against opposing political factions . The durable anti-Semitism that has been displayed , especially in the hardliners ' suppression of would-be liberalizers in 1968 , has been all the more striking since there are so few Jews left in Poland today to serve as scapegoats. // //
