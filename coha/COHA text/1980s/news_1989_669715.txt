Called Operation Trophy Kill , its mission was to stop the wanton killing of big game and the flow of animal contraband in and around the park . During the first three-years of the ' ' sting ' ' operation , 50 people were charged with poaching. // The unofficial leader of the loose band of poachers around the area was a hunter named Loren Ellison . ' ' ( He ) started out poaching a little here and there , started getting anti-establishment , then got into drugs , ' ' Mr. Carlson says . ' ' He was someone to be reckoned with . ' ' Mr. Ellison illegally killed animals in the park and sold the antlers to undercover federal agents during the sting . Authorities waited three years to establish a strong enough case against him . During that time he also killed 14 golden eagles and sold them for $200 each . Ellison is currently serving a 15-year prison sentence. // // Operation Trophy Kill is now four years old . Although penalties for those convicted are severe , poaching in the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poaching charges in Colorado last week. // According to Ranger , the journal of the Association of National Park Rangers , $250 , 000 worth of elk horns was sold last year around Yellowstone alone. // ' ' But across the whole country , approximately $1 billion are spent on wildlife products , ' ' says Jerry Smith , deputy chief of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ' s Division of Law Enforcement . Some of the products are obtained legally , but most of the killing is covert and illegal . ' ' It doesn ' t take long for the numbers to climb when you consider the going rate for a gyrfalcon is $100 , 000 , ' ' Mr. Smith says . The animals are sold to black market dealers who ship them to outlets from New York to Seoul . The annual income places the poaching industry high in the ranks of the Fortune 500 companies . And with large foreign markets to supply , the industry is expanding. // By definition , poaching is the illegal taking of wildlife . And according to Neil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Denver , poachers will do almost anything for profit . ' ' Poachers will go out into the wild and take some type of wildlife that ' s protected by state or federal law without being licensed to do so , through fraudulent licenses , out of season , over limits , taking by some unlawful method , or after hours , ' ' Mr. Hartman explains . These methods are particularly damaging to animal populations. // A recent sting operation is Operation Smokey , which centers around the Appalachian Mountains in the Southeast . Federal officials arrested 52 people involved in the killing , transporting , and buying of illegal black bear parts . The operation was a lot like a drug bust . In fact , wildlife enforcement officers say their job is similar to enforcing drug laws . The illegal activity is covert , it deals with contraband , and it is done randomly to elude authorities . The black bear ' s gall bladder , which in oriental folk medicine is believed to be a potent medicine and aphrodisiac , retails for as much as $5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the variety and extent of poaching . For $10 , 000 you can hire a guide to fly you into Alaska ' s interior to kill a grizzly bear from the air . In Florida the endangered manatee ( sea cow ) and the alligator are hunted illegally . Off the coasts of both Maine and Washington , fish are caught in illegal numbers or in waters that are out of bounds . And in marshes and regional aerial flyways across the nation , migratory waterfowl are destroyed in alarming numbers. // US Fish and Wildlife deputy Jerry Smith says , ' ' Thousands of ducks and geese are illegally killed every year . ' ' Birds are easily harvested hundreds at a time as they feed in open fields . This kind of killing damages existing and future populations . When female animals of any kind are killed in large numbers , the populations are impaired in their ability to reproduce. // There isn ' t enough manpower to patrol vast areas where poaching occurs . Alaska , for example , has millions of square miles of wilderness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal agents to cover the entire US , ' ' Mr. Smith says . ' ' And there ' s a total of 9 , 271 local and federal agents on the local and federal level of enforcement to patrol the entire US . There are more law officers in Dade County , Fla. , alone than the total number of wildlife law enforcement officers. ' ' // Randy Hancock , a wildlife manager for Colorado , patrols 800 square miles from his headquarters in Buena Vista . The poaching targets in his district are eagles , bighorn sheep , deer , and elk . He says , ' ' My job is to catch the everyday folks and provide info that would help apprehend these people on a higher level . ' ' In addition to enforcement , Mr. Hancock manages the wildlife populations in his area. // Hancock uses a deer decoy to catch poachers . The two-dimensional device is very realistic , even from 20 yards away . The decoy is set up before legal shooting hours or after the legal hunting season . In one 24-hour period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poaching efforts generally increase in the spring and summer , when the new growing horns of an elk become valuable . ' ' The blood antlers are the most valuable in the oriental trade , the spring and summer ( activity ) is some of the worst that goes on , ' ' says Hancock . Many poachers will kill a large elk and leave the carcass after sawing off the antlers. // Last year , Hancock broke up a large , local operation that is an example of the national problem . Large numbers of deer were being illegally slaughtered and used as bait for legal and illegal coyote trapping . A coyote pelt is sold legally for $50 to $150. // One of the men he arrested was Rob Van Evry . He and his partner went to trial and were heavily fined . His motives were simple , he says in an interview in Buena Vista . ' ' It was greed - you know it was greed. ' ' // Van Evry and partner Phil Martinez lost their firearms and vehicles used in illegal trapping . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or own a firearm . Van Evry won ' t be able to hunt again for two years . ' ' They came down hard when they busted us , $12 , 000 , 65 misdemeanors , and a felony at one time , ' ' says Van Evry . In addition to poaching , Van Evry guided illegal hunts for wealthy , out-of-town hunters , who paid anywhere from $75 a day to $1 , 500 a hunt. // In a multimillion dollar business where all the players are armed , law enforcement officers are cautious . Two Idaho game wardens lost their lives trying to arrest a notorious poacher . Game manager Hancock says , ' ' Every officer carries either a 357 Magnum or a 9 mm ( handgun ) . We all carry shotguns . I ' ve never had to fire my weapon and I ' m glad . It ' s something as a law officer you have to think about. . . .
