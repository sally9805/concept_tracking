 | In the early 1960s a black elementaryschool principal named Edward Gardner began mixing hair-care products in his basement . With the help of his wife and four children , Gardner hawked his Soft Sheen products out of the back of his car , going block to block through his South Side Chicago neighborhood . His determination transformed Soft Sheen Products , Inc. , into an $80 million family company . Then a heavyweight challenger hit the streets . Revlon , Inc. , began packaging many of its ethnic hair-care products in a yellow-and-red design that looks remarkably like Soft Sheen 's best-selling Care Free Curl brand . " I heard that the people at Revlon say , We do n't want just part of the market , we want all of it ' , " Gardner says . " Well , they 're not going to get it . " Soft Sheen faces more than a South Side turf battle . White companies are waging war in the black hair-care market ? and many black-owned companies are losing . The ethnic haircare industry , now worth $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Struggling with slow growth , white-owned cosmetics companies have targeted blacks , who tend to spend more than whites on hair care . They now make a host of " me too " black hair-care products , such as Alberto-Culver 's TCB ( " taking care of business " ) and Lustrasilk 's Right On . Carson Products , a white-run Georgia firm , makes a best-selling ethnic hair coloring . White businesses now control 50 percent of the ethnic hair-care market ? and they 'll elbow out more black businesses if , as expected , Procter &; Gamble , Gillette and Chanel enter the industry . Irving Bottner , president of Revlon 's professionalproducts division , says , " In the next couple of years , the blackowned businesses will disappear . They 'll all be sold to the white companies . " If black hair-care companies vanish , so too will the last real bastion of black-to-black enterprise . Over the past two decades black businesses , which thrived in segregated markets , have been giving way to white companies . Franchise chains like McDonald 's replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insurance firms are disappearing . In 1982 black companies grossed $12.4 billion , only .16 percent of all business revenues . Some sectors , like the black media , remain healthy , says University of Maryland Prof. William Bradford . But the only black businesses still making big profits serving blacks are the hair-care companies . " What 's happening in the ethnic market happens all of the time , " says Stuart Meyer , business professor at Northwestern University . " It will happen to any pioneer of a segmented market that is identified as significant . It 's not nefarious ; it 's the Darwinian business world . " Black business was not just economics : it was part of a dream . At one time , many blacks ? and whites , too ? believed that building a strong black-business sector was the surest way to achieve racial and economic equality . Successful black entrepreneurs ? like Madame C. J. Walker , inventor of the straightening comb ? were local heroes . Today black business has less appeal for the younger generation , who believe these goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They get the M.B.A . and go right to work for the major corporation and forget about building their own businesses , " says Gardner . If these young businessmen do n't realize the importance of blackowned enterprises , he argues , blacks will never break the cycle of poverty . Brand names : Black consumers seem just as oblivious to the needs of black business . Like everyone else they base many of their buying decisions on price or designer cachet . This year blacks will spend only 7.4 percent of their $200 billion income at black establishments , according to economist Andrew Brimmer . Lafayette Jones , executive director of the American Health and Beauty Aids Institute , a black trade group , argues , " It 's the younger blacks , who did n't live through the civil-rights movement , who do n't understand why they should care . " He complains that younger consumers are too  | influenced by brand names . The AHBAI recently launched a $2 million promotion to change these attitudes . Using a silhouette of a " proud lady " as the logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When you 're under this much business pressure , you use any advantage you 've got ? and we have the advantage of being black , " Jones says . White businesses say the campaign is unfair . " They 're making a social issue out of a business issue , " Bottner argues . " When you produce what the consumer wants , loyalties disappear . " Black beauty businesses will need more than ethnic pride to fend off the aggressive marketing and bigger budgets of their white competitors . With their quality marketing and ability to offer pricing advantages , they outperform the black companies . Bottner says some black companies tend to offer poorergrade products . " We are accused of taking business away from the black companies , but black consumers buy quality products ? too often their black brothers did n't do them any good . " The intense competition has reduced prices across the board , says Carol Cornell at Business Trend Analysts . Previously , black companies could set higher prices , since black consumers had fewer alternatives . Many black businessmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their products . Cornell McBride , cofounder of M &M; Products , an Atlantabased hair-care company , says , " I 've gone to many chain stores where there is a little old white lady doing the purchasing and not getting an adequate return . " Although many black-made products could be used by whites , store owners tend to place them on separate shelves , giving them less visibility and less space . In many supermarkets , ethnic products make up 40 percent of personal-care purchases but get only 25 percent of the space . " Food stores still have some prejudice , " says McBride . " They think that if you bring more blacks to the store , there will be more pilferage . " Many young black businessmen say that these problems lie more in outdated business practices than discrimination . Harold Augustus , 37-year-old advertising manager for Worlds of Curls , brings in big sales with his multiracial , contemporary ads . He also put together a joint promotion contest with American Honda Motor Co. , offering hair-product buyers the chance to win a Honda scooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general markets ? a coup , since Japanese firms rarely target black markets . Another black company , American Beauty Products in Tulsa , actively courts white consumers in its ads for Donnie 's Super Curl : " Whether black or white , Super Curl is out of sight ! " Young Turks : Established black companies resisted such strategies far too long ? and many still cling to selling styles that worked for their original urban-poor customer base . The AHBAI 's Jones admits there is a split in the black business community between the street-smart founders and the M.B.A.-trained Young Turks . " We 've had our fiery discussions , but we understand that if we do n't work together , we wo n't be here . " The AHBAI , which represents $390 million in sales clout , is attempting to improve distribution and to provide members with managerial advice . The clash between old and new business practices has been especially damaging to Johnson Products , the modern pioneer in black hair care . Founded in 1954 by George Johnson , a sharecropper 's grandson , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Afro hairstyle created huge demand for its Afro Sheen brand ; at its peak Johnson Products owned 80 percent of the market . Since the Afro went out of style , the company has lost ground . Johnson is not granting interviews , but critics say his biggest mistake was to delay entering the curl mat het . The curl ? a loose-perm look that requires a bevy of maintenance products ? was introduced by whiterun Intel national Playtex Corp. , makers of Jheri-Kurl , and popularized by stars like Michael Jackson . From 1978 to 1982 the curl spurred industry growth at a 32 percent rate . But the curl may be on the way out , and fashion experts say the latest trend is " extensions , " attachable braids that need no maintenance . Faced with slowing sales , even old-line companies see the need to target new markets . Johnson makes a new line of men 's toiletries endorsed by basketball star Michael Jordan . Gardner sells a new line of men 's hair-care products in Great Britain , which he sees as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversified into food and bakeware with products targeted at both whites and blacks . By employing such strategies , some black businesses should be able to hang on successfully . But the real question seems to be : will it be worth it ? Today many young businessmen ? both black and white ? prefer big bucks to social causes . Augustus says that selling out to a white company may be irresistible to smaller businesses . " I might find it hard , but if the e is enough of a carrot I 'd go for it , " he says . " I 'm not like the black fathers with the black pride and all . The bottom line is to make money . " In which case , black entrepreneurship may become a civil right that no one cares to defend . @# E S EEK OCTOBER 13 , 1986 55
