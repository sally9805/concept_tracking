Over and over the word recurred as Biographer Edmund Morris made his way through research on Theodore Roosevelt . His contemporaries talked of T.R. 's " sweetness . " Even Roosevelt 's political opponent Woodrow Wilson was smitten . " There is a sweetness about him that is very compelling , " he said . " You ca n't resist the man . " Mark Twain , William Jennings Bryan and even the peevish Henry Adams all were beguiled at one time or another , according to Morris . <P> " Sweetness " was a word scorned by muscular America . It became " charm . " And that is what T.R. 's fifth cousin Franklin Roosevelt was all about , says James Rowe , the Washington lawyer who at 28 became F.D.R. 's executive assistant . Franklin made people like him and want to please him . At their first meeting in the Oval Office , Roosevelt threw his head back , beamed up at Rowe and said , " Jim , I want your advice . " Rowe was captive for life . <P> During his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm into power . Critics would contend it is the only thing sustaining his presidency . They may be right . Charm is a cousin once removed to style , which was one of John Kennedy 's renowned qualities .

The cold-eyed journalists leaped to their feet to cheer . " That 's charm , " said one of Reagan 's close friends . A fortnight ago , House Speaker Tip O'Neill called a cease-fire in the budget war and asked Reagan up for lunch to celebrate St. Patrick 's Day . Reagan readily accepted . For a few hours there was nothing but sweetness . The next day they were back beating each other 's brains out . Says O'Neill : " Away from politics , he 's a charmer .

Queen Elizabeth did not have to throw a party-after-the-party for the Reagans during her West Coast visit . But she did , and even joined in songs around the piano , a royal rarity . <P> " He looks straight at you , gives you an eager handshake , always smiles , and it is obviously an honest expression , " says a diplomat . For the tune he is with you , claims one of Reagan 's closest friends , " he really is interested in you . " Simple but powerful . Charm alone can not reorder the world , but it seems to go further than many thought possible . <P> A skeptical Washington author , not wishing to burden Reagan with affairs of state , asked him about Jimmy Stewart . " I do n't want to monopolize your time , " said the President , " but let 's sit down and let me tell you about Jimmy . " Half an hour later Reagan had another fan .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
