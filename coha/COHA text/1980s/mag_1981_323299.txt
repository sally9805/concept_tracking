In her back-to-campus blue blazer with white piping , Ellen Putter could pass for a senior psych major at most Ivy League schools . But professors at New York City 's Barnard College better not treat her like one . Last week Putter , 31 , a graduate of the women 's college and Columbia Law School , was named president of Barnard , Columbia 's sister school . She thus becomes the youngest woman head of a major U.S. college . Actually , she has been acting president while on leave from a New York City law firm . Putter 's no-nonsense managerial style and success in raising money won high marks from Barnard 's 2,500 students and board of trustees , but at her own request , the committee searching for a permanent president did not consider her until it had reviewed 159 other candidates . <P> <P> Mon Dieu , the news was enough to send any self-respecting member of Parisian cafe society lunging for the bicarbonate of soda . Maxim 's , the world-renowned , gastronomic masterpiece on the city 's tony Rue Royale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fashion Designer Pierre Cardin . The $20 million tab was steep even for Cardin , 58 , who lately seems more interested in haute finance than haute couture . He has had designs on the art nouveau establishment since 1978 , when Maxim 's present owners , Louis and Maggie Vaudable , agreed to lend the eatery 's venerable name to a Cardin-owned line of boutiques and consumer products . The French designer now hopes to squeeze even more profits out of the name by launching a chain of mini-Maxim 's boutiques in the U.S. and Japan . <P> <P> Visiting a Midwestern hog farm last week on a three-week U.S. tour , the Archbishop of Canterbury , Robert Runcie , groaned with gratitude . " I have received so many gifts , " said he , " I may have to open an Iowa room when I get back to Lambeth Palace in London . " Runcie , 59 , certainly had his hands full with the 40-lb . Berkshire maiden who seemed intent on hogging the spotlight . The gift was nothing to snoot at - as a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . The latest addition to the Archbishop 's porcine parish listened beatifically as Runcie gushed , " I love my pigs . " She perked a wary swine 's ear , however , when the Archbishop added , " but I do n't mind eating them . " <P> " I feel blessed , " grins Elsie Berger , 72 , at being named the first Horsewoman of the Year by Horseman and Fair World magazine . She was certainly a long shot , for men had won the honor the previous 24 years . Starting with little more than a dream-a mare named Niagara Dream , to be exact-Berger turned a mom-and-pop stable into a racing powerhouse . Her ticket to the winner 's circle was Niatross , a strapping bay regarded as the swiftest standard-bred in the history of the sport . In two years , he took top laurels on 37 of 39 trips to the post , earned $2 million and became the sixth horse to win pacing 's Triple Crown . Now that Niatross has hung up his harness for a life on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have moved into the fast lane . Berger , who occasionally brandishes a stogie at the race track for Runyonesque effect , turns matronly when talking about the two : she calls them her " girls . " <P>
