The headline of the full-page advertisement that appeared last week in 22 English-language newspapers across South Africa said simply , LET THE A.N.C . SPEAK FOR ITSELF . The ad then urged State President P.W . Botha to legalize the outlawed African National Congress , which that very day was holding a 75th-anniversary celebration at its headquarters-in-exile in Lusaka , Zambia . Prominently featured in the advertisement was a silhouette of Nelson Mandela , the A.N.C . ' s symbolic leader , who is serving out a life sentence at Pollsmoor Prison , near Cape Town . The advertisement , placed by 18 antiapartheid and church groups , asserted that " there can be no solution to this country 's problems without the participation of the A.N.C . " <P> The government 's response to the ad was swift . By midnight it had extended emergency press regulations to forbid publication of " any advertisement or report calculated to improve or promote the public image or esteem of an organization which is unlawful . " Likewise forbidden were attempts to praise , defend , explain or justify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rules was clear : any positive mention of the A.N.C . would be judged " subversive " and subject editors to a $9,000 fine , a ten-year prison term or closure of their publications . <P> The ad represented the most brazen of several challenges last week to the Pretoria government . In the coastal city of Port Elizabeth , the Rev. Allan Hendrickse , one of Botha 's two nonwhite Cabinet ministers , led a group of 30 protesters to whites-only King 's Beach for a chilly ten-minute " splashabout " in defiance of the law . Proclaimed Hendrickse : " This is God 's beach ! " In the Transvaal , Ster-Kinekor , South Africa 's main distributor of foreign films , said it would stop supplying U.S. productions from Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures unless whites-only admissions policies were dropped . Ster-Kinekor said it was under pressure from the two U.S. filmmakers . <P> Such continuing pressure on Pretoria was cold comfort to A.N.C . President Oliver Tambo as he presided over anniversary festivities in Lusaka . There were speeches , rallies and a birthday cake decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.N.C . ' s colors . But the most remarkable event was Tambo 's speech , in which he played down the bloody guerrilla tactics that the A.N.C . has advocated in recent years . Instead , he embarked on a more moderate approach , pledging that " civilians , both black and white , " would not be harmed by A.N.C . fighters . He called on whites to " come together in a massive democratic coalition " with blacks . Declared Tambo : " Our white compatriots have to learn the truth , that it is not democracy that threatens their future . Rather , it is racist tyranny . "
