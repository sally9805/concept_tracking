How to lose a zillion , by Francis Ford Coppola <P> Laid on at a cost of $4,000 , it was a banquet fit for a movie king : white and green pasta , chicken with mozzarella and prosciutto , strawberries dipped in chocolate , vintage wine . Francis Ford Coppola , 41 , the director of the Godfather films and Apocalypse Now , had invited 100 journalists to inspect the most elaborate toy a movie-mad boy could hope to own : Zoetrope Studios , the 10-acre Hollywood production lot he bought early in 1980 to make his own films and those of fiercely loyal independent moviemakers he has invited to join him . This , he hoped , would be the studio of the future , an artistic Arcadia with nine sound stages , 34 editing rooms and newfangled videotape-and film-editing technology designed to allow films to be shot and completed in five weeks , half the normal time . But when the proprietor tried to explain the marvels of his " electronic studio , " his guests bombarded him with questions about the cash crisis that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy about love in Las Vegas , and may sink Zoetrope altogether . Was the nation 's premier moviemaker in trouble ? Said he , throwing his palms out : " I 'm always in money trouble . " <P> Coppola has always dreamed big about the movies . As a young man he went to Las Vegas to win enough money to buy a movie camera . In the early ' 70s he gambled successfully with Oscar-winning Godfathers , and then parlayed his work into a nine-hour TV mini-series that brought him more millions . Three-and-a-half years ago he came close to bankruptcy when a typhoon and other problems drove the cost of Apocalypse Now from the budgeted $12 million to over $30 million ; now , 18 months after its release , the Viet Nam epic is in the black . Still , Coppola ca n't help envying the even greater financial success of another hot moviemaker . In 1973 Coppola produced a low-budget feature by George Lucas , and the film , American Graffiti , became a surprise hit . With Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Says one screenwriter : " Francis has spent long hours bemoaning the twist of fate that brought George all that money . " Lucas has invested much of his movie winnings in the conversion of a 2,000-acre tract in California 's Marin County into a production base . With Zoetrope , Coppola hoped to build a prototype movie world of his own . <P> He corralled estimable talents from all over the world . Jean-Luc Godard ( Breathless , Weekend ) came from France , Michael Powell ( The Red Shoes , Peeping Tom ) from England , experimental Film Maker Scott Bartlett from San Francisco and Hoofer Gene Kelly from the heart of Hollywood . He put three films into production on the Zoetrope lot : Hammett , a surreal murder mystery directed by the German Wim Wenders ; The Escape Artist , starring Ryan O'Neal 's 16-year-old son Griffin ; and One from the Heart . By January , Zoetrope had some 500 employees and a $600,000-a-week payroll . Inevitably , Coppola 's Olympian disregard for the bottom line led to deep financial trou ble . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its way to filming , was shut down before completion . <P> Then a few weeks ago , after the budget for One from the Heart ballooned from $12 million to $23 million , a group of investors withdrew $8 million of Heart 's financing .
