Westmoreland 's side marshals some facts and figures <P> Walt Rostow , an archetype of the best and the brightest , spoke slowly and carefully , recalling in vivid detail a meeting that took place in April 1967 . General William Westmoreland , then commander of U.S. armed forces in Viet Nam , had asked for 200,000 more troops . President Lyndon Johnson and top aides pressed for a date by which the American forces would win . As jurors in a Manhattan federal courtroom listened intently , the former National Security Adviser said he had no recollection of Westmoreland 's having offered misleadingly hopeful " good news . " The exchange was subdued but freighted with drama . This was no memoir , no scholarly retrospective . It was the first testimony , by one of the architects of America 's longest and costliest war , in what may prove to be the most celebrated libel case in U.S. history : Westmoreland 's $120 million suit against CBS News . After almost three years of crossfire in the court of public opinion , the battle is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit has aroused expectations of a definitive judgment on issues ranging from the adversary role of the press to the apportionment of blame for the U.S. failure in Viet Nam . Federal District Judge Pierre Leval , however , emphasized to jurors last week that they will be asked to decide specific matters of fact . A " historical inquiry , " Leval warned , could last a lifetime . Instead , the focus is on what CBS alleged in its 1982 documentary The Uncounted Enemy : that Westmoreland engaged in " a conspiracy at the highest levels of military intelligence " to mislead his superiors , including the President , about the size and scope of enemy troop strength , and thus about the success of his war of attrition . <P> Westmoreland contends that what CBS portrayed as a conspiracy was in reality a legitimate and widely understood debate about how to evaluate the impact of part-time , often untrained , guerrilla opponents . He charges that CBS News Producer George Crile and Correspondent Mike Wallace willfully ignored evidence that supported him . To bolster his attack , Westmoreland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had given a three-hour interview to CBS that was left on the cutting-room floor , and former Special Ambassador Robert Komer , who was not even questioned by the CBS producers . <P> Rostow , who was characterized by Author David Halberstam in The Best and the Brightest as a " cheerleader " for the military effort , said that Johnson had been well aware of disputes among military factions and the CIA over how to count " self-defense " and " secret self-defense " forces . These fighters , who operated , respectively , in enemy-and U.S.-held territory , laid traps and took potshots but were not part of regular combat units . Komer , who was known to Viet Nam-era journalists as Blow Torch for his high-powered manner , was asked by CBS Attorney David Boies whether these forces were armed . Komer laughed . " We never could find these people , " he said , " much less determine whether they were armed . " Responding to CBS charges that Westmoreland and others had felt pressure to produce upbeat troop-level estimates , Komer added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to ceilings or preconceived limits .
