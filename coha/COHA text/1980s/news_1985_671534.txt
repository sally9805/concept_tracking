Stuart A. Feldstein has spent most of his career as a business journalist , and his partner , Mark S. Kamm , worked as a private investigator . Now they hire themselves out to major corporations willing to pay generously for information on a competitor ' s costs , its plans to introduce a new product or the type of research it is conducting. // Whether they are doing it themselves or hiring the likes of Mr. Feldstein and Mr. Kamm , a rapidly growing number of American companies are stepping up their efforts to keep tabs on each other as well as foreign competitors - especially the Japanese . <> <> Overseeing Intelligence Efforts // Several companies , including Motorola , Eastman Kodak , General Motors and Cross &; Trecker , the big machine tool maker , have either established formal intelligence units or designated specialists to oversee their intelligence efforts within the last two or three years. // Many other companies , such as GTE , General Electric and Pfizer , do not have separate intelligence staffs but are nonetheless making " competitor analysis " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning process. // Not surprisingly , the consultants and companies that are willing to discuss the topic of business intelligence insist that they do not - and would not - resort to illicit methods to glean information . Stealing a company ' s documents on its product plans or proprietary technology , for instance , would constitute industrial espionage , with possible civil and criminal penalties . Instead , the corporate intelligence operations are said to employ such methods as tracking patents , talking to industry insiders and taking apart a competitor ' s products to see how they tick. // " There is a great deal more attention being paid to all phases of competitor analysis than I have seen before , " said Paul A. Branstad , a strategy specialist at Booz , Allen &; Hamilton Inc. , the management consulting company . " Understanding your competitors ' positions and how they might evolve is the essence of the strategic game . " <> <> Pricing Study // For instance , one recent client of the SMR Research Corporation , the New Jersey-based concern of Mr. Feldstein and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer loan operation was pricing its loans unusually low . Was it because the unit was trying to build market share or because its cost of funds was low ? " That kind of information is imperative in order to compete with Citicorp subsidiaries , whose results are seldom discussed by Citicorp itself , " Mr. Feldstein said. // Many companies maintain that gathering information is not necessarily a question of spending more money , but rather using existing resources , such as a sales force , to pass on that information and make more of an effort to exploit it . Nonetheless , spending appears to be increasing . The intelligence-gathering budgets of 25 major companies recently surveyed by Information Data Search , a business intelligence firm based in Cambridge , Mass. , ranged from $50 , 000 to more than $1. 5 million. // Corporate clients of Washington Researchers pay the 11-year-old company as much as $60 , 000 to check up on a competitor , said Leila K. Kight , the firm ' s president. // Mr. Feldstein has also found plenty of companies willing to pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sears , Roebuck &; Company ' s financial services operations . Some of those buyers , he said , were Citicorp , Bank of America , Prudential and G.E. Credit . <> <> Changes in Strategic Planning // The increased interest in business intelligence parallels the changes in the strategic planning process that have occurred in recent years. // " Up until five years ago , many firms , in effect , designed their strategies as if they had no competitors , " noted Liam Fahey , an expert on competitor analysis who teaches at Boston University. // Indeed , strategic planners in many companies were numbers-crunching business-school graduates who might have been steeped in all the latest quantitative models , but lacked first-hand knowledge of the businesses whose future they were supposedly plotting. // That became only too apparent in the late 1970 ' s and early 1980 ' s , when growth in many markets stalled , competition intensified and many grandiose strategies turned out not to be worth the paper upon which they were written . <> <> Battle Plans // With operating managers - rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corporate officials and consultants said , those strategies are becoming something they should have been all along : battle plans for beating the competition . And that requires understanding the competition ' s current and future position in everything from its manufacturing costs and technology to its plant capacity and sources of supply. // " If you want to survive in the future , you ' ve got to know more about your competition than we - American companies - have in the past , " said D. Otis Wolkins , the vice president who oversees the GTE Corporation ' s business intelligence efforts. // Japanese companies , of course , have long been the acknowledged experts in the area of business intelligence . They have been legendary for deploying armies of engineers and marketing specialists to gather mountains of information on American manufacturing techniques , product design and technology. // And by using that information to pinpoint American companies ' weaknesses , they have been able to carve out formidable positions in industries ranging from steel and automobiles to semiconductors and consumer electronics . <> <> Watching the Competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are touring competitors ' factories , dissecting their products and pumping competitors ' customers , suppliers and even their former employees for information. // " One of the many purposes of General Motors ' joint venture with Toyota " to manufacture small cars in California " was to get information " on Toyota ' s manufacturing techniques , acknowledged Carlisle R. Davis , group director of quality at G.M. ' s Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada division and former head of the division ' s organizational competitiveness group. // A similar motive helps to explain the surge in the number of American corporations opening offices in Japan . " A lot of companies are here for the purpose of monitoring what ' s being developed , " Herbert F. Hayde , president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan , said in a telephone interview from Tokyo. // Sometimes , of course , companies have become overly zealous and have crossed the legal boundary in obtaining information on the competition . <> <> Corporate Espionage // The most celebrated recent case of corporate espionage involved a major Japanese electronics company , Hitachi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stealing trade secrets from the International Business Machines Corporation. // This past September , a unit of GTE pleaded guilty to conspiring to illegally obtain Pentagon planning documents . The Justice Department said GTE had hoped to use the documents to help it win contracts for electronic-warfare equipment. // But so far , at least , the increased intelligence activity of American corporations has not resulted in a noticeable increase in industrial espionage , according to spokesmen for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. // Clearly , there are many legal methods that companies can employ to find out what the competition is up to . <> <> Ferreting Out Information // To ferret out information about a target company , Mr. Feldstein scours newspapers , magazines and trade journals . He interviews the target company ' s competitors , suppliers and customers . And SMR also maintains a data base of more than 10 , 000 people who have changed jobs and might make good sources of information on their former employers. // " Half of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About 20 percent can ' t because of confidentiality agreements . The other 30 percent , you can ' t get off the phone , " said Mr. Feldstein , who emphasized that " we never pay them for information. " // While once the Japanese were famous for taking apart American products and using what they learned to improve their own , American companies are now repaying the Japanese in kind. // A visitor to the Xerox Corporation ' s technology complex near Rochester might very well find technicians dissecting Canon ' s personal copier . Xerox now regularly disassembles and analyzes other companies ' photocopiers in an attempt to figure out competitors ' manufacturing costs and to monitor changes in technology and the use of new materials. // By doing so , Xerox spotted a dramatic increase in the use of plastics that make photocopiers lighter , more durable and easier to manufacture . Xerox now is also using more plastic , said H. Barry Bebb , a Xerox vice president. // If some American companies are still not sure how to monitor their competitors , many intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money to teach them. // " Competitive analysis , " said Robert B. Duncan , associate dean for academic affairs at Northwestern University ' s business school , " is one of the hottest topics on the seminar market right now. " //
