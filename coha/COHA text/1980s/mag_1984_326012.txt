In the Israeli-occupied south , Shi'ite resentment runs deep <P> On the same morning that an explosion shattered the U.S. embassy annex on the outskirts of East Beirut , another act of terror was being carried out 29 miles away in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon . In the small Shi'ite Muslim village of Suh-mur , 13 people were murdered by militiamen of the Christian-dominated Army of Southern Lebanon , apparently in retaliation for the earlier killing of four of its soldiers . <P> The slayings were just another episode in what has become almost routine violence in the southern third of Lebanon , where the largely Shi'ite Muslim population 's resentment of both the Israelis and the Christian militia grows by the day . It is an area that has bred small cells of violent fanatics , including , Israeli officials say , adherents of the Islamic Jihad , or Islamic Holy War , who claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing . The mounting tension between the occupying Israelis and the Shi'ite population was emphasized by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin last week when he said , " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time bomb . " <P> More than two years after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon , some 22,000 Israeli troops remain in southern Lebanon . Their purpose : to keep Palestine Liberation Organization fighters from filtering back and posing a fresh threat to Israel 's northern border towns and settlements . But since the Israeli army in Lebanon withdrew from the Beirut area south to the Awali River a year ago , 60 soldiers have been killed and 469 wounded in Lebanese attacks . Every month brings about 70 to 80 new assaults . " We are on a spiral to nowhere , " says a prominent Sidon citizen . " The more the Israelis are attacked , the more repressive they become , and that only leads to more desperation and attacks . " <P> As a result , southern Lebanon is growing increasingly isolated from the rest of the country , a fact that is starkly obvious at the main Israeli checkpoint , near the Lebanese village of Batir al Chouf . Every day the roadway teems with hundreds seeking passage between southern Lebanon and the north . Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspect baggage and examine papers . <P> In an effort to clamp down on arms smuggling , the Israeli army has further restricted access to and from the south . Travelers heading in either direction must first obtain permits from an Israeli office in the south . Beirutis wishing to visit the occupied area must ask relatives or friends living in the south to obtain the documents for them . The rules sometimes discriminate : Muslims are forced to travel through the mobbed Batir checkpoint , whereas Christians can take a ferry from Jiyah , north of Sidon , to East Beirut . What used to be a 40-minute taxi ride between Beirut and Sidon is now a journey that takes hours , even days .
