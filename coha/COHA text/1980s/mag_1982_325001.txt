Anglicans and Catholics negotiate the role of the papacy <P> After the Second Vatican Council , the Roman Catholic Church dropped its aloof attitude toward the ecumenical movement and began discussions with numerous other Christian churches . The most promising negotiations of all were with the Anglican Communion , which originated when King Henry VIII broke with Rome but which still considers itself a bridge between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism . For more than a decade a joint Anglican-Roman Catholic commission has been working to develop a theological basis for reunion . Next week Rome and Canterbury are expected to issue the group 's final proposals . In the report both sides agree that there is no doctrinal barrier to reunification , and that even the most difficult problem-the office of the Pope-need not stand in the way . <P> The negotiations were authorized in 1966 by Pope Paul VI and the then Anglican leader , Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey . Meeting under the joint chairmanship of the Anglican Archbishop of Dublin , H.R. McAdoo , and Roman Catholic Bishop Alan Clark of Great Britain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two officials of the Vatican Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity . <P> The negotiators first developed statements of consensus on the theological meaning of both the Eucharist and of the priesthood . By 1976 the Anglicans had agreed that in a future union it would be " appropriate " to have the center of the universal church in the See of Rome . That , of course , was only the beginning for the touchy issues involving the papacy . After years of further labor , the negotiators polished their final recommendations late last summer on the grounds of England 's Windsor Castle , where Henry once walked . <P> To avoid old angers , the new document shuns the word Pope altogether . Instead it speaks of the " Bishop of Rome " acting in the role of " universal primate . " If the terminology is unfamiliar , so is the result . The report describes a leader who is more of a Pope than Anglicans are accustomed to , yet less of a Pope than Roman Catholicism-and Pope John Paul II-may find acceptable . <P> The text begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Pope , and that this authority was passed to Peter 's successors . Even if Anglicans do not find New Testament support for that version of history , the new document says , they can still accept the concept of a single head of the church in Rome , both as a gift of God and as a practical necessity . <P> The knottiest troubles came from the extension of papal powers by the First Vatican Council of 1870 , necessitating the most important , and most intricate , wording of the new accord . Vatican I had proclaimed that the Pope has personal and direct jurisdiction over all church members . The negotiators offer grudging acceptance of the idea that a universal primate of the church has a responsibility , now and then , to speak and act on behalf of the entire church , or to involve himself with the affairs of local bishops and dioceses . That is considerably less than what Vatican I said , but it is still a major concession by the Anglicans .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
