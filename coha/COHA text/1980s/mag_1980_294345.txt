If any single art show can be said to have saved the life of a financially troubled institution , it must be the display called " Post-Impressionism , " which opened at London 's Royal Academy in November and has been running to crowds at 2 a head ever since . In the months before the show , the Academy was rumored to be in such dire fiscal straits that it was going to have to sell its most famous possession , the Michelangelo Tondo of the Madonna and Child . Now it has been ransomed by the oldest form of modern art , a fact that is rich in historical irony since the Academy was the last bastion of " traditional " art to hold out against the encroachment of modernism . Long after the Museum of Modern Art in New York became a going concern , Royal Academicians like Sir Alfred Munnings were still rising over their port at Academy banquets to denounce Czanne as a fumbler and Van Gogh as a crop-eared madman . No doubt their offended ghosts are gibbering in the courtyard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the largest exhibition of early modern art ever mounted in Great Britain , with nine Cezannes , 13 Van Goghs , 14 Gauguins , twelve Seurats-in all , 428 works by 169 painters , from 1880 to the early 1900s . They represent the very conception of culture that the Royal Academy , when such work was first seen in England before World War I , believed it was its mission to crush . If anyone still doubts that modernism is our academy , our official culture , here is the ocular proof of it . <P> It is right that this show should be held in London , since the word post-impressionism was invented there , and applied to the painting of the 1880s by Roger Fry , the English art critic , when he organized a sensationally vilified show of Manet , Van Gogh , Gauguin , Seurat , Czanne and others at the Grafton Galleries in 1910 . By then the painters that Fry 's exhibition encircled were all dead , and his name for them was a last resort : he toyed with calling them " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last exclaimed , " Oh , let 's just call them postimpressionists ; at any rate , they came after the impressionists ! " And so the word was born . It described nothing , but it indicated that after 1880 , the annus mirabilis that saw the birth of modern art , there had been a general reaction against impressionism among younger European painters , sometimes even within the ranks of the impressionists themselves .
