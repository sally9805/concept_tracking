 | " Where 's Morris ' , ma'am ? " Beth said loudly . The woman turned and looked at her furiously . " On Upper Street , " she said . " Where 's Upper Street ? " The woman looked for a moment as if she would scream . Then her face relaxed and she said , " Two blocks up Main . " Beth took the escalators down . Morris ' was on a corner , next to a drugstore . Beth pushed open the door and found herself in a big room full of more books than she had ever seen in her life . There was a bald man sitting on a stool behind a counter , smoking a cigarette and reading . Beth walked up to him and said , " Do you have Modern Chess Openings ? " The man turned from his book and peered at her over his glasses . " That 's an odd one , " he said in a pleasant voice . " Do you have it ? " " I think so . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the store . A minute later he came back to Beth , carrying it in his hand . It was the same fat book with the same red cover . She caught her breath when she saw it . " Here you go , " the man said , handing it to her . She took it and opened it to the part on the Sicilian Defense . It was good to see the names of the variations again ; the Levenfish , the Dragon , the Najdorf . They were like incantations in her head , or the names of saints . After a while she heard the man speaking to her . " Are you that serious about chess ? " " Yes , " she said . He smiled . " I thought that book was only for grandmasters . " Beth hesitated . " What 's a grandmaster ? " " A genius player , " the man said . " Like Capablanca , except that was a long time ago . There are others nowadays , but I do n't know their names . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was very relaxed , and he talked to her as though she were another adult . Fergussen was the closest thing to him , but Fergussen was sometimes very official . " How much is the book ? " Beth asked . " Pretty much . Five ninety-five . " She had been afraid it would be something like that . After today 's two bus fares she would have ten cents left . She held the book out to him and said , " Thank you . I ca n't afford it . " " Sorry , " he said . " , Just put it on the counter .  | " Sure . Under Games and Sports . Go take a look . " At the back of the store was a whole shelf of them with titles like Paul Morphy and the Golden Age of Chess ; Winning Chess Traps ; How to Improve Your Chess ; Improved Chess Strategy . She took down one called Attack and Counterattack in Chess and began reading the games , picturing them in her mind without reading the diagrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few customers went in and out of the store . No one bothered her . She read through game after game and was surprised in some of them by dazzling moves  --  queen sacrifices and smothered males . There were sixty games , and each had a title at the top of the page , like " V. Smyslov-I . Rudakaysky : Moscow 1945 " or " A. Rubinstein-O . Duras : Vienna 1908 . " In that one , White queened a pawn on the thirty-sixth move by threatening a discovered check . Beth looked at the cover of the book . It was smaller than Modern Chess Openings and there was a sticker on it that said $2.95 . She began going through it systematically . The clock on the bookstore wall read ten-thirty . She would have to leave in an hour to get to school for the History exam . Up front the clerk was paying no attention to her , absorbed in his own reading . She began concentrating , and by eleven-thirty she had twelve of the games memorized . On the bus back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind some of the moves  --  not the glamorous ones like the queen sacrifices but sometimes only in the one-square advance of a pawn  --  she could see subtleties that made the small hairs on the back of her neck tingle . She was five minutes late for the test , but no one seemed to care and she finished before everyone else anyway . In the twenty minutes until the end of the period she played " P. Keres-A . Tarnowski : Helsinki 1952 . " It was the Ruy Lopez Opening where White brought t he bishop out in a way that Beth could see meant an indirect attack on Black 's king pawn . On the thirty-fifth move White brought his rook down to the knight seven square in a shocking way that made Beth almost cry out in her seat . Fairfield , Junior High had social clubs that met for an hour after school and sometimes during home-room period on Fridays . There was the Apple Pi Club and the Sub I ) ebs and Girls Around Town . They were like sororities at a college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Apple Pi were eighth and ninth graders ; most of them wore bright , cashmcre sweaters and fashionably scuffed saddle ox-  | fords with argyle socks . Some of them lived in the country and owned horses . Thoroughbreds . Girls like that never looked at you in the hallways ; they were always smiling at someone else . Their sweaters were bright yellow and deep blue and pastel green . Their socks came up to just below the knees and were made of 100 percent virgin wool from England . Sometimes when Beth saw herself in the mirror of the girls ' room between classes , with her straight brown hair and narrow shoulders and round face with dull brown eyes and freckles across the bridge of her nose , she would taste the old taste of vinegar in her mouth . The girls who belonged to the clubs wore lipstick and eye shadow ; Beth wore no make-up and her hair still fell over her forehead in bangs . It did not occur to her that she would be pledged to a club , nor did it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " we will begin to study the binomial theorem . Does anyone know what a binomial is ? " From the back row Beth put up her hand . It was the first time she had done this . " Yes ? " Mrs. MacArthur said . Beth stood , feeling suddenly awkward . " A binomial is a mathematical expression containing two terms . " They had studied this last year at Methuen . " X plus Y is a binomial . " " Very good , " Mrs. MacArthur said . The girl in front of Beth was named Margaret ; she had glowing blond hair and wore a cashmere sweater of a pale , expensive lavender . As Beth sat down , the blond head turned slightly back toward her . " Brain ! " Margaret hissed . " Goddamn brain ! " Beth was always alone in the halls ; it hardly occurred to her that there was any other way to be . Most girls walked in pairs or in threes , but she walked with no one . One afternoon when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of distant laughter and looked down the hall to see , haloed by afternoon sunlight , the back of a tall black girl . Two shorter girls were standing near her , by the water fountain , looking up at her face as she laughed . None of their features was distinct , and the light from behind them made Beth squint . The taller girl turned slightly , and Beth 's heart almost stopped at the familiar tilt of her head . Beth took a quick dozen steps down the hallway toward them . But it was n't . Jolene . Beth stopped suddenly and turned away .  | The three girls left the fountain and pushed noisily out the front door of the building . Beth stood staring after them for a long time . " Could you go to Bradley 's and get me some cigs ? " Mrs. Wheatley said . " I think I have a cold . " " Yes , ma'am , " Beth said . It was Saturday afternoon and Beth was holding a novel in her lap , but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between P. Morphy and someone called simply " grandmaster . " There was something peculiar about Morphy 's eighteenth move , of knight to bishop five . It was a good attack , but Beth felt Morphy could have been more destructive with his queen 's rook . " I 'll give you a note , since you 're a bit youthful for smoking yourself . " " Yes , ma'am , " Beth said . " Three packs of Chesterfields . " " Yes , ma'am . " She had been in Bradley 's only once before , with Mrs. Wheatley . Mrs. Wheatley gave her a penciled note and a dollar and twenty cents . Beth handed the note to Mr. Bradley at the counter . There was a long rack of magazines behind her . When she got the cigarettes , she turned and began looking . Senator Kennedy 's picture was on the cover of Time and Newsweek : he was running for President and probably would n't make it because he was a Catholic . There was a row of women 's magazines that all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue Ann and the other Apple Pi 's . Their hair shone ; their lips were full and red . She had just decided to leave when something caught her eye . At the lower right-hand corner , where the magazines about photography and sunbathing and do-it-yourself were , was a magazine with a picture of a chess piece on its cover . She walked over and took it from the rack . On the cover was the title , Chess Review , and the price . She opened it . It was full of games and photographs of people playing chess . There was an article called " The King 's Gambit Reconsidered " and another one called " Morphy 's Brilliancies . " She had just been going over one of Morphy 's games ! Her heart began beating faster . She kept going through the pages . There was an article about chess in Russia . And the thing that kept turning up was the word " tournament . " There was a whole section called " Tournament Life . " She had not known there was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just something you did , the way Mrs. Wheatley h(x)ked rugs and put together jigsaw puzzles .  | " Young lady , " Mr. Bradley said , " you have to buy the magazine or put it back . " She turned , startled . " Ca n't I just . . . ? " " Read the sign , " Mr. Bradley said . In front of her was a hand-lettered sign : IF You WANT TO READ IT  --  BuY IT . Beth had fifteen cents and that was all . Mrs. Wheatley had told her a few days before that she would have to do without an allowance for a while ; they were rather short and Mr. Wheatley had been delayed out West . Beth put the magazine back and left the store . Halfway back up the block she stopped , thought a moment and went back . There was a stack of newspapers on the counter , by Mr. Bradley 's elbow . She handed him a dime and took one . Mr. Bradley was busy with a lady who was paying for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine rack with her paper under her arm and waited . After a few minutes Mr. Bradley said , " We have three sizes . " She heard him going to the back of the store with the lady following . Beth took the copy of Chess Review and slipped it into her newspaper . Outside in the sunshine she walked a block with the paper under her arm . At the first corner she stopped , took out the magazine and slipped it under the waistband of her skirt , covering it with her robbin's-egg-blue sweater , made of reprocessed wool and bought at Ben Snyder 's . She pulled the sweater down loosely over the magazine and dropped the newspaper into the corner trash can . Walking home with the folded magazine tucked securely against her flat belly she thought again about that rook move Morphy had n't made . The magazine said Morphy was " perhaps the most brilliant player in the history of the game . " The rook could come to bishop seven , and Black had better not take it with his knight because ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barking somewhere , and across the street from her on a well-mowed lawn two small boys were loudly playing tag . After the second pawn moved to king knight five , then the remaining rook could slide over , and if the black player took the pawn , the bishop could uncover , and if he did n't .. . She closed her eyes . If he did n't capture it , Morphy could force a mate in two , starting with the bishop sacrificing itself with a check . If he did take it , the white pawn moved again , and then the bishop went the other way and there was nothing Black could do . There it was . One of the little boys across the street began crying . There was nothing Black could do . The game would be over in twenty-nine moves  | at least . The way it was in the book , it had taken Paul Morphy thirty-six moves to win . He had n't seen the move with the rook . But she had . Overhead the sun shone in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child wailed . Beth walked slowly home and replayed the game . Her mind was as lucid as a perfect , stunning diamond . " Allston should have returned weeks ago , " Mrs. Wheatley was saying . She was sitting up in bed , with a crossword-puzzle magazine beside her and a little TV set on the dresser with the sound turned down . Beth had just brought her a cup of instant coffee from the kitchen . Mrs. Wheatley was wearing her pink robe and her face was covered with powder . " Will he be back soon ? " Beth said . She did n't really want to talk with Mrs. Wheatley ; she wanted to get back to Chess Review . " He has been unavoidably detained , " Mrs. Wheatley said . Beth nodded . Then she said , " I 'd like to get a job for after school . " Mrs. Wheatley blinked at her . " A job ? " " Maybe I could work in a store , or wash dishes somewhere . " Mrs. Wheatley stared at her for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said finally . She blew her nose quietly on a tissue and folded it . " I should think you are well provided for . " " I 'd like to make some money . " " To buy clothes with , I suspect . " Beth said nothing . " The only girls of your age who work , " Mrs. Wheatley said , " are colored . " The way she said " colored " made Beth decide to say nothing further about it . To join the United States Chess Federation cost six dollars . Another four dollars got you a subscription to the magazine . There was something even more interesting : in the section called " Tournament Life " there were numbered regions ; including one for Ohio , Illinois , Tennessee and Kentucky , and in the listing under it was an item that read : " Kentucky State Championship , Thanksgiving weekend , Henry Clay High School Auditorium , Lexington , Fri. , Sat . Sun. , " and under this it said : " $185 in prizes . Entry fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take six dollars to join and five dollars to get into the tournament . When you took the bus down Main you passed Henry Clay 1 Iigh ; it was eleven blocks from , Janwcll Drive . And it was five weeks until Thanksgiving .  | " Can anyone say it verbatim ? " Mrs. MacArthur said . Beth put up her hand . " Beth ? " She stood . " In any right triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides . " She sat down . Margaret snickered and leaned toward Gordon , who sat beside her and sometimes held her hand . " That 's the brain ! " she whispered in a soft , girlish voice radiant with contempt . Gordon laughed . Beth looked out the window at the autumn leaves . " I do not know where the money goes ! " Mrs. Wheatley said . " I have bought little more than trifles this month , and yet my hoard has been decimated . Decimated . " She plopped into the chintz-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-eyed , as if expecting a guillotine to fall . " I have paid electric bills and telephone bills and have bought simple , uncomplicated groceries . I have denied myself cream for my morning coffee , have bought nothing whatever for my person , have attended neither the cinema nor the rummage sales at First Methodist , and yet I have seven dollars left where I should have at least twenty . " She laid the crumpled onedollar bills on the table beside her , having fished them from her purse a few moments before . " We have this for ourselves until the end of October . It will scarcely buy chicken necks and porridge . " " Does n't Methuen send you a check ? " Beth said . Mrs. Wheatley brought her eyes down from the ceiling and stared at her . " For the first year , " she said evenly . " As if the expenses of keeping you did n't exhaust it . " Beth knew that was n't true . The check was seventy dollars , and Mrs. Wheatley did n't spend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to live passably until the first of the month , " Mrs. Wheatley said . " I am thirteen dollars short of that . " She turned her gaze briefly ceilingward and then back to Beth again . " I shall have to keep better records . " " Maybe it 's inflation , " Beth said , with some truth . She had taken only six , for the membership . " Maybe it is , " Mrs. Wheatley said , mollified . The problem was the five dollars for the entry fcc . In home room , the day after Mrs. Wheatley 's oration about money , Beth took a sheet from her composition book and wrote a letter to Mr. Shaibel , Custodian , Methuen Home , Mount Sterling , Kentucky . It read :  | Dear Mr. Shaibel : There is a chess tournament here with a first prize of one hundred dollars and a second prize of fifty dollars . There are other prizes , too . It costs five dollars to enter it , and I do n't have that . If you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars if I win any prize at all . Very truly yours , Elizabeth Harmon The next morning she took an envelope and a stamp from the cluttered desk in the living room while Mrs. Wheatley was still in bed . She put the letter in the mailbox on her way to school . In November she took another dollar from Mrs. Wheatley 's purse . It had been a week since she wrote Mr. Shaibel , and there had been no answer . This time , with part of the money , she bought the new issue of Chess Review . She found several games that she could improve upon  --  one by a young grandmaster named Benny Watts . Benny Watts was the United States Champion . Mrs. Wheatley seemed to have a good many colds . " I have a proclivity for viruses , " she would say . " Or they for me . " She handed Beth a prescription to take to Bradley 's and a dime to buy herself a Coke . Mr. Bradley gave her an odd look when she came in , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to the back of the store . Beth carefully avoided standing near the magazines . When she took the Chess Review a month before , it had been the only copy . He might have noticed it right away . Mr. Bradley brought back a plastic container with a typed label on it . He put it down on the counter while he got a white paper bag . Beth stared at the container . The pills in it were oblong and brightgreen . " This will be my tranquillity medicine , " Mrs. Wheatley said . " McAndrews has decided I need tranquillity . " " Who 's McAndrews ? " Beth said . " Dr. McAndrews , " Mrs. Wheatley said , unscrewing the lid . " My physician . " She took out two of the pills . " Would you get me a glass of water , dear ? " " Yes , ma'am , " Beth said . As she was going into the bathroom for the ? water , Mrs. Wheatley sighed and said , " Why do they only fill these Ixrttles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue there were twenty-two games from an invitational tournament in Moscow . The players had names like Botvinnik and Petrosian and Laev ; they sounded like people in a fairy tale . There was a photograph showing two of them hunched over a board , dark-haired and grim-lipped . They wore black suits . Out of focus , behind them , sat a huge audience . In a game between Petrosian and someone named Benkowitz , in the semifinals , Beth saw a bad decision of Petrosian 's . He started an attack with pawns but should n't have . There was a commentary on the game by an American grandmaster , who thought the pawn moves were good , but Beth saw deeper than that . How could Petrosian have misjudged it ? Why had n't the American seen the weakness ? They must have spent a long time studying it , since the magazine said the game took five hours . Margaret only slipped the shaft into her gym lock and did n't twist the dial afterward . They were in shower stalls side by side now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cones . Beth 's chest was still like a boy 's and her pubic hair had just started coming in . Margaret ignored Beth and hummed while she soaped herself . Beth stepped out and wrapped herself in a towel . Still wet , she went back into the locker room . There was no one there . Beth dried her hands quickly and very quietly slipped the shaft out of Margaret 's lock , muffling it in her towel . Her hair dripped on her hands , but that did n't matter ; there was water all over from the boys ' gym . Beth slipped off the lock and opened the locker door , slowly so it would n't squeak . Her heart was thumping like some kind of little animal in her chest . It was a fine brown purse of real leather . Beth dried her hands again and lifted it down from the shelf , listening carefully . There were giggles and shouts from the girls in the shower , but nothing else . She had made a point of being the first in , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left quickly . No one else would be through yet . She opened the purse . There were colored postcards and a new-looking lipstick and a tortoise-shell comb and an elegant linen handkerchief . Beth pushed through these with her right hand . At the bottom , in a little silver money clip , were bills . She pulled them out . Two lives . She hesitated for a moment and then took them both , together with the dip . She put the purse back and replaced the lock . She had kft her own door shut but unlocked . She onenrd it now  | and slid the clipped fives into her Algebra book . Then she locked her door , went back to the shower and stayed there washing herself until all the other girls had left . When everyone else was gone , Beth was still getting dressed . Margaret had not opened her purse . Beth sighed deeply , like Mrs. Wheatley . Her heart was still pounding . She got the money clip out of her algebra book and pushed it under the locker Margaret had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's purse , and anybody could have taken the money . She folded the bills and put them in her shoe . Then she took her own blue plastic purse from the shelf , opened it and reached into the little pocket that held the mirror . She took out two green pills , put them in her mouth , went to the washstand and swallowed them down with a paper cup of water . Supper that night was spaghetti and meatballs from a can , with Jello-O for dessert . While Beth was doing the dishes and Mrs. Wheatley was in the living room turning the volume up on the TV , Mrs. Wheatley suddenly said , " Oh , I forgot . " Beth went on scrubbing the spaghetti pan and in a minute Mrs. Wheatley appeared with an envelope in her hand . " This came for you , " she said and went back to the Huntley-Brinkley Report . It was a smudged envelope addressed in pencil . She dried her hands and opened it ; there were five one-dollar bills inside and no message . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bills in her hand . The green pills were four dollars for a bottle of fifty . The label read : " Three refills . " Beth paid with four one-dollar bills . She walked home briskly and put the prescription slip back in Mrs. Wheatley 's desk .  | AT TI-IE ENTRANCE TO THE GYM A DESK HAD BEEN SET UP , AND TWO men in white shirts were sitting behind it . Behind them were rows of long tables with green-and-white chessboards . The room was full of people talking and a few playing ; most of them were young men or boys . Beth saw one woman and no colored people . Pinned to the desk near the man on the left was a sign that read ENTRY FEES HERE . Beth walked up to him with her five dollars . " Do you have a clock ? " the man asked . " No . " " We have a clock-sharing system , " he said . " If your opponent does n't have one , come back to the desk . Play starts in twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have a rating . " " Have you ever played in a tournament before ? " " No . " The man pointed to Beth 's money . " Are you sure you want to do this ? " " I 'm sure . " " We do n't have a woman 's section , " he said . She just stared at him . " I'II put you in Beginners , " he said . " No , " Beth said , " I 'm not a beginner . "  | The other young man had been watching them . " If you 're an unrated player , you go in Beginners with the people under sixteen hundred , " he said . Beth had paid little attention to ratings in Chess Review , but she knew that masters had at least 2200 . " What 's the prize for Beginners ? " she said . " Twenty . " " What about the other section ? " " First prize in the Open is one hundred . " " Is it against any rule for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not a rule , exactly , but ? " " Then put me in it . " Beth held out the bills . The man shrugged and gave Beth a card to fill out . " There are three guys out there with ratings over eighteen hundred . Beltik may show up , and he 's the state champion . They 'll eat you alive . " She took a ball-point pen and began filling in the card with her name and address . Where a blank said " Rating " she put a large zero . She handed the card back . They started twenty minutes late . It took them a while to get the pairings posted . When they were putting the names on the board Beth asked the man next to her if it was done at random . " Not at all , " he said . " They arrange it by ratings on the first round . After that , winners play winners , and losers , losers . " When her card was finally put up it said " Harmon-Unr  --  Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packer-Unr  --  White . " The two cards were by the number Twenty-seven . They turned out to be the last two . She walked over to Board Twenty-seven and seated herself at the black pieces . She was at the last board on the farthest table . Sitting next to her was a woman of about thirty . After a minute , two more women came walking over . One was about twenty , and the other was Beth 's opponent  --  a tall , heavy high school girl . Beth looked over the expanse of tables , where players were getting settled or , already seated , were beginning games ; all of them were male , mostly young . There were four female players at the tournament and they were all clumped together at the far end , playing against one another . Beth 's opponent sat down with some awkwardness , put her twofaced chess clock at the side of t he board and held out a hand . " I 'm Annette Packer , " she said . Her hand felt large and moist in Bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I do n't understand about them clocks . "  | Annette seemed relieved to have something to explain . " The clock face nearest you measures your playing time . Each player has ninety minutes . After you move , you press the button on top , and it stops your clock and starts your opponent 's . There are little red flags over the number twelve on each clock face ; yours will fall down when the ninety minutes are up . If it does that , you 've lost . " Beth nodded . It seemed like a lot of time to her ; she had never put more than twenty minutes into a chess game . There was a ruled sheet of paper by each player , for recording moves . " You can start my clock now , " Annette said . " Why do they put all the girls together ? " Beth said . Annette raised her eyebrows . " They 're not supposed to . But if you win , they move you up . " Beth reached out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Annette took her king 's pawn somewhat nervously and moved it to king four . " Oh , " she said , " it 's touch move , you know . " " What 's that ? " " Do n't touch a piece unless you 're going to move it . If you touch it , you have to move it somewhere . " " Okay , " Beth said . " Do n't you push your button now ? " " Sorry , " Annette said and pressed her button . Beth 's clock started ticking . She reached out firmly and moved her queen bishop 's pawn to its fourth square . The Sicilian Defense . She pressed the button and then put her elbows on the table , on each side of the board , like the Russians in the photographs . She began attacking on the eighth move . On the tenth she had one of Annette 's bishops , and on the seventeenth her queen . Annette had not even castled yet . She reached out and laid her king on its side when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . She sounded relieved to have lost . Beth looked at the clock faces . Annette had used thirty minutes , and Beth seven . Waiting for Annette to move had been the only problem . The next round would not be until eleven . Beth had recorded the game with Annette on her score sheet , circled her own name at the top as winner ; she went now to the front desk and put the sheet into the basket with the sign reading WINNERS . It was the first one there . A young man who looked like a college student came up as she was walking away and put his sheet in . Beth had already noticed ) t hat most of the people here were n't good-looking . A lot of them had greasy hair and had complexion ; some were lift and nervous-looking . But this one was tall and angular and relaxed , and his lace was open  | and handsome . He nodded amiably at Beth , acknowledging her as another fast player , and she nodded back . She began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the games being played . Another couple finished theirs , and the winner went up front to turn in the record . She did not see any positions that looked interesting . On Board Number Seven , near the front of the room , Black had a chance to win a rook by a two-move combination , and she waited for him to move the necessary bishop . But when the time came he simply exchanged pawns in the center . He had not seen the combination . The tables began with Board Number Three rather than One . She looked around the room , at the rows of heads bowed over the boards , at the Beginners Section far across the gym . Players were getting up from their chairs as games ended . At the far side of the room was a doorway she had n't noticed before . Above it was a cardboard sign saying " Top Boards . " Beth walked over . It was a smaller room , not much bigger than Mrs. Wheatley 's living room . There were two separate tables and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of the floor and a black velvet rope on wooden staunchions kept the watchers from getting too close to the players . There were four or five people silently watching the games , most of them clustered around Board Number One , on her left . The tall , good-looking player was one of them . At Board One two men were sitting in what seemed to be utter concentration . The clock between them was different from the others Beth had seen ; it was bigger and sturdier . One man was fat and balding with a darkness to his features like the Russians in the pictures , and he wore a dark suit like the Russians ' . The other was much younger and wore a gray sweater over a white shirt . He unbuttoned his shirtsleeves and pulled up the sleeves to his elbows , one arm at a time , not taking his eyes from the board . Something in Beth 's stomach thrilled . This was the real thing . She held her breath and studied the position on the board . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced and difficult , like some of the championship games in Chess Review . She knew it was Black 's move because the indicator on his clock was moving , and just as she saw that knight to bishop five was what was called for , the older man reached out and moved his knight to bishop five . The good-looking man was leaning against the wall now . Beth went over to hint and whispered , " Who are they ? " " Beltik and Cullen . Beltik 's the State Champion . " " Which is which ; ' " Beth said .  | The tall man held a finger to his lips . Then he said softly , " Beltik 's the young one . " That was a surprise . The Kentucky State Champion looked to be about the age of Fergussen . " Is he a grandmaster ? " " He 's working on it . He 's been a master for years . " " Oh , " Beth said . " It takes time . You have to play grandmasters . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of them by the velvet ropes turned and stared at her angrily . The tall man shook his head , pursing his lips for silence . Beth turned back to the ropes and watched the game . Other people came in and the room began to fill up . Beth held her place at the front . There was a great deal of tension in the middle of the board . Beth studied it for several minutes trying to decide what she would do if it were her move ; but she was n't certain . It was Cullen 's move . She waited for what seemed an awfully long time . He sat there with his forehead supported by clenched fists , knees together under the table , motionless . Beltik leaned back in his chair and yawned , looking amusedly at Cullen 's bald head in front of him . Beth could see that his teeth were bad , with dark stains and several empty spaces , and that his neck was n't properly shaved . Finally Cullen moved . He traded knights in the center . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each player relinquishing a knight and a bishop in trades . When his move came again he looked up at Beltik and said , " Draw ? " " Hell , no . " Beltik said . He studied the board impatiently , screwed up his face in a way that looked funny , smacked a fist into a palm , and moved his rook down to the seventh rank . Beth liked the move , and she liked the way Beltik picked up his pieces firmly and set them down with a tiny graceful flourish . In five more moves Cullen resigned . He was down by two pawns , his remaining bishop was locked into the back rank , and the time on his clock was almost up . He toppled his king with a kind of elegant disdain , reached over and gave a hasty handshake to Beltik , stood up and stepped over the rope , brushing past Beth , and left the room . Beltik stood and stretched . Beth looked at him standing over the board with the toppled king , and something in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and legs . Beth 's next game was with a small and bristly man named Cooke ; his rating was 1520 . She printed it in at the top of the score sheet by Board Thirteen : " Harmon llnr : Cooke 1520 . " It was her turn to play white . She moved pawn to queen four and presrcu Cooke 's  | clock , and he moved instantly with pawn to queen four . He seemed wound up very tight and his eyes kept glancing around the room . He could n't sit still in his chair . Beth played fast too , picking up some of his impatience . In five minutes they had both developed their pieces , and Cooke started an attack on her queenside . She decided to ignore it and advanced a knight . He hastily pushed a pawn up , and she saw with surprise that she could not take the pawn without risking a nasty double attack . She hesitated . Cooke was pretty good . The 1500 rating must mean something , after all . He was better than Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary with his impatience . She slid her rook to the bishop 's home square , putting it below the oncoming pawn . Cooke surprised her . He picked up his queen bishop and took one of the pawns next to her king with it , checking her and sacrificing the piece . She stared at the board , suddenly unsure for a moment . What was he up to ? Then she saw it . If she took , he checked again with a knight and picked off a bishop . It would win him the pawn and bring her king out . Her stomach was tight for a moment ; she did not like being surprised . It took her a minute to see what to do . She moved the king over but did not take the bishop . Cooke brought the knight down anyway . Beth traded the pawns over on the other side and opened the file for her rook . Cooke kept nagging her king with complications . She could see now that there was really no danger yet if she did n't let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then doubled up with her queen . She liked that arrangement ; it looked to her imagination like two cannons , lined up and ready to fire . In three moves she was able to fire them . Cooke seemed obsessed with the maneuvers he was setting up against her king and blind to what Beth was really doing . His moves were interesting , but she saw they had no solidity because he was n't taking in the whole board . If she had been playing only to avoid checkmate , he would have had her by the fourth move after his first check with the bishop . But she nailed him on the third . She felt the blood rushing into her face as she saw the way to fire her rook . She took her queen and brought it all the way to the last rank , offering it to the black rook that sat back there , not yet moved . Cooke stopped his squirming for a moment and looked at her face . She looked back at him . Then he studied the position , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen with his rook . Something in Beth wanted to jump and shout . But she held herself back , reached out , pushed her bishop over one square and  | quietly said , " Check . " Cooke started to move his king and stopped . Suddenly he saw what was going to happen : he was going to lose his queen and that rook he had just captured with , too . He looked at her . She sat there impassively . Cooke turned his attention to the board and studied it for several minutes , squirming in his seat and scowling . Then he looked back to Beth and said , " Draw ? " Beth shook her head . Cooke scowled again . " You got me . I resign . " He stood up and held out his hand . " I did n't see that coming at all . " His smile was surprisingly warm . " Thanks , " Beth said , shaking his hand . They broke for lunch and Beth got a sandwich and milk at a drugstore down the block from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter and left . Her third game was with an older man in a sleeveless sweater . His name was Kaplan and his rating was 1694 . She played Black , used the Nimzo-Indian defense , and beat him in thirty-four moves . She might have done it quicker , but he was skillful at defending  --  even though with White a player should be on the attack . By the time he resigned she had his king exposed and a bishop about to be captured , and she had two passed pawns . He looked dazed . Some other players had gathered around to watch . It was three-thirty when they finished . Kaplan had played with maddening slowness , and Beth had gotten up from the table for several moves , to walk off her energy . By the time she brought the score sheet to the desk with her name circled on it , most of the other games were over and the tournament was breaking up for supper . There would be a round at eight o'clock that evening , then three more on Saturday . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beth went to the girls ' room and washed her face and hands ; it was surprising how grubby her skin felt after three games of chess . She looked at herself in the mirror , under the harsh lights , and saw what she had always seen : the round uninteresting face and the colorless hair . But there was something different . The cheeks were flushed with color now , and her eyes looked more alive than she had ever seen them . For once in her life she liked what she saw in the mirror . Back outside by the front table the two young men who had registered her were putting up a notice on the bulletin hoard . Some players had gathered around it , t he handsome one among them . She walked over . The lettering on top , done with a Magic Marker , read  | UNDEFEATED . There were four names on the list . At the bottom was HARMON : she held her breath for a moment when she saw it . And at the top of the list was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " It was the handsome one . " Yes . " " Keep it up , kid , " he said , smiling . Just then the young man who had tried to put her in the Beginners Section shouted from the table , " Harmon ! " She turned . " Looks like you were right , Harmon , " he said . Mrs. Wheatley was eating a potroast TV dinner with whipped potatoes when Beth came in . Bat Masterson was on , very loudly . " Yours is in the oven , " Mrs. Wheatley said . She was in the chintz chair with the aluminum plate on a tray in her lap . Her stockings were rolled down to the tops of her black pumps . During the commercial , while Beth was eating the carrots from her TV dinner , Mrs. Wheatley asked , " How did you do , honey ? " and Beth said , " I won three games . " " That 's nice , " Mrs. Wheatley said , not taking her eyes from the elderly gentleman who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.O . That evening Beth was on Board Six opposite a homely young man named Klein . His rating was 1794 . Some of the games printed in Chess Review were from players with lower ratings than that . Beth was White , and she played pawn to king four , hoping for the Sicilian . She knew the Sicilian better than anything else . But Klein played pawn to king four and then fianchettoed his king 's bishop , setting it over in the corner above his castled king . She was n't quite sure but thought this was the kind of opening called " Irregular . " In the middle game , things got complex . Beth was unsure what to do and decided to retreat a bishop . She set her index finger on the piece and immediately saw she had better move pawn to queen four . She reached over to the queen pawn . " Sorry , " Klein said . " Touch move . " She looked at him . " You have to move the bishop , " he said . She could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had probably seen what she could do if she moved the pawn . She shrugged and tried to act unconcerned , but inside she was feeling something she had n't felt be  --  ** in a chess game . She was  | frightened . She moved the bishop to bishop four , sat back and folded her hands in her lap . Her stomach was in a knot . She should have moved the pawn . She looked at Klein 's face as he studied the board . After a moment she saw a little malicious grin . He pushed his queen 's pawn to the fifth square , punched his clock smartly and folded his arms across his chest . He was going to get one of her bishops . And abruptly her fear was replaced by anger . She leaned over the board and placed her cheeks against her palms , studying intently . It took her almost ten minutes , but she found it . She moved and sat back . Klein hardly seemed to notice . He took the bishop as she hoped he would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the board , and Klein grunted slightly but moved quickly , pushing the queen pawn forward again . Beth brought her knight over , covering the pawn 's next step , and more important , attacking Klein 's rook . He moved the rook . Inside Beth 's stomach something was beginning to uncoil . Her vision seemed extremely sharp , as though she could read the finest print from across the room . She moved the knight , attacking the rook again . Klein looked at her , annoyed . He studied the board and moved the rook , to the very square Beth had known , two moves ago , that he would move to . She brought her queen out to bishop five , right above Klein 's castled king . Still looking annoyed and sure of himself , Klein brought a knight over to defend . Beth picked up her queen , her face flushing , and took the pawn in front of the king , sacrificing her queen . He stared and took the queen . There was nothing else he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishop out for another check . Klein interposed the pawn , as she knew he would . " That 's mate in two , " Beth said quietly . Klein stared at her , his face furious . " What do you mean ? " he said . Beth 's voice was still quiet . " The rook comes over for the next check and then the knight mates . " He scowled . " My queen ? " " Your quecn 'll be pinned , " she said , " after the king moves . " He looked back to the board and stared at the position . Then he said , " Shit ! " He did not turn over his king or offer to shake Beth 's  | hand . He got up from the table and walked away , jamming his hands into his pockets . Beth took her pencil and circled HARMON on her score sheet . When she left at ten o'clock there were three names on the UNDEFEATED List . HARMON was still at the bottom . BELTIK was still at the top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep because of the way the games kept playing themselves over and over in her head long after she had stopped enjoying them . After several hours of this she got out of bed and in her blue pajamas walked over to the dormer windows . She raised a shade and looked out at the newly bare trees by the light of the street lamp , and at the dark houses beyond the trees . The street was silent and empty . There was a sliver of a moon , partly obscured by clouds . The air was chilly . Beth had learned not to believe in God during her time in Methuen 's chapel , and she never prayed . But now she said , under her breath , Please God let me play Beltik and checkmate him . In her desk drawer , in the toothbrush holder , were seventeen green pills , and there were more in a little box on her closet shelf . She had thought earlier about taking two of them to help her doze off . But she did not . She went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slept soundly . On Saturday morning she had hoped to be playing someone with a rating over 1800 . The man at registration had said there were three who were that high . But on the pairings she was shown playing Black against someone named Townes with a rating of 1724 . That was lower than her last game , the evening before . She went to the desk and asked about it . " That 's the breaks , Harmon , " the man in the white shirt said . " Consider yourself lucky . " " I want to play the best , " Beth said . " You have to get a rating before that happens , " the young man said . " How do I get a rating ? " " You play thirty games in USCF tournaments and then wait four months . That 's how you get a rating . " ' Fhat 's too long . " The man leaned toward her . " I low old arc you , Harmon ? " " ' Thirteen . "  | " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a rating . Beth was furious . " I want to play Beltik . " The other man at the table spoke up . " If you win your next three games , honey . And if Beltik does the same . " " I 'll win them , " Beth said . " No , you wo n't , Harmon , " the first young man said . " You 'll have to play Sizemore and Goldmann first , and you ca n't beat both of them . " " Sizemore and Goldmann shit , " the other man said . " The guy you 're playing now is underrated . He plays first board for the university team and last month he came in fifth in Las Vegas . Do n't let the rating fool you . " " What 's in Las Vegas ? " Beth asked . " The U.S. Open . " Beth went to Board Four . The man seated behind the white pieces was smiling as she came up . It was the tall , handsome one . Beth felt a bit rattled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie star . " Hi , Harmon , " he said , holding out his hand . " It looks like we 've been stalking each other . " She shook his big hand awkwardly and seated herself . There was a pause for a long minute before he said , " Do you want to start my clock ? " " Sorry , " she said . She reached out to start it , almost knocked it over but caught it in time . " Sorry , " she said again , almost inaudibly . She pressed the button and his clock started ticking . She looked down at the board , her cheeks burning . He played pawn to king four , and she replied with the Sicilian . He continued with book moves and she followed with the Dragon variation . They traded pawns in the center . Gradually she got her composure back , playing these mechanical moves , and she looked across the board at him . He was attentive to the pieces , scowling . But even with a scowl on his face and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stomach felt strange as she looked at him , with his broad shoulders and clear complexion and his brow wrinkled in concentration . He surprised her by bringing his queen out . It was a bold move , and she studied it for a while and saw that there was n't any weakness to it . She brought out her own queen . He moved a knight to the fifth rank , and Beth moved a knight to the fifth rank . Ile checked  | with a bishop , and she defended with a pawn . He retreated the bishop . She was feeling light now , and her fingers with the pieces were nimble . Both players began moving fast but easily . She gave a non-threatening check to his king , and he pulled away delicately and began advancing pawns . She stopped that handily with a pin and then feinted on the queenside with a rook . He was undeceived by the feint and , smiling , removed her pin , and on his next move continued the pawn advances . She retreated , hiding her king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused , yet her face remained serious . They continued their dance . It made her sad in a way when she eventually saw how to beat him . It was after the nineteenth move , and she felt herself resisting it as it opened up in her mind , hating to let go of the pleasant ballet they had danced together . But there it was : four moves and he would have to lose a rook or worse . She hesitated and made the first move of the sequence . He did n't see what was happening until two moves later , when he frowned suddenly and said , " Jesus Christ , Harmon , I 'm going to drop a rook ! " She loved his voice ; she loved the way he said it . He shook his head in mock bafflement ; she loved that . Some players who had finished their game early had gathered around the board , and a couple were whispering about the maneuver Beth had brought off . Townes went on playing for five more moves , and Beth felt genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and saying " Damn ! " But he stood up , stretched and smiled down at her . " You 're one hell of a chess player , Harmon , " he said . " How old are you ? " " Thirteen . " He whistled . " Where do you go to school ? " " Fairfield Junior . " " Yeah , " he said . " I know where that is . " He was even better-looking than a movie star . An hour later she drew Goldmann and Board Three . She walked into the tournament room at exactly eleven , and the people standing stopped talking when she came in . Everyone looked at her . She heard someone whisper , " Thirteen fucking years old , " and immediately the thought came into her mind , along with the exultant feeling the whispered voice had given her : I could have done this at eight . ( ; oldniann was tough and silent and slow . He was a short , heavy man , and he played the black pieces like a gruff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that Beth tried he got out of . Every piece he had was protected ; it seemed as though there were double the usual complement of pawns to protect them . Beth got fidgety during the long waits for him to move ; once after she had advanced a bishop she got up , and went to the bathroom . Something was hurting in her abdomen , and she felt a bit faint . She washed her face with cold water and dried it on a paper towel . As she was leaving , the girl she 'd played her first game with came in . Packer . Packer looked glad to see her . " You 're moving right on up , are n't you ? " she said . " So far , " Beth said , feeling another twinge in her belly . " I heard you 're playing Goldmann . " " Yes , " Beth said . " I have to get back . " " Sure , " Packer said , " sure . Beat his ass , will you ? Just beat his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . When she got back she saw that Goldmann had moved , and her clock was ticking . He sat there in his dark suit looking bored . She felt refreshed and ready . She seated herself and put everything out of her mind except the sixty-four squares in front of her . After a minute she saw that if she attacked on both flanks simultaneously , as Morphy did sometimes , Goldmann would have difficulty playing it safe . She played pawn to queen rook four . It worked . After five moves she had opened his king up a little , and after three more she was at his throat . She paid no attention to Goldmann himself or to the crowd or to the feeling in her lower abdomen or the sweat that had broken out on her brow . She played against the board only , with lines of force etched for her into its surface : the small stubborn fields for the pawns , the enormous one for the queen , the gradations in between . Just before his clock was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name on the score sheet she looked again at the number of Goldmann 's rating . It was 1997 . People were applauding . She went directly to the girls ' room and discovered that she had begun to menstruate . For a moment she felt , looking at the redness in the water below her , as though something catastrophic had happened . Had she bled on the chair at Board Three ? Were the people there staring at the stains of her blood ? But she saw with relief t hat her cotton panties were barely spotted . She thought abruptly oliolent .. If it had n't been for , Jolene , she would have had no idea what was happening . No one else had said a word about this certainly  | not Mrs. Wheatley . She felt a sudden warmth for Jolene , remembering that Jolene had also told her what to do " in an emergency . " Beth began pulling a long sheet from the roll of toilet paper and folding it into a tightly packed rectangle . The pain in her abdomen had eased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldmann : 1997 . She put the folded paper into her panties , pulled them up tight , straightened her skirt and walked confidently back into the playing area . Beth had seen Sizemore before ; he was a small , ugly , thin-faced man who smoked cigarettes continuously . Someone had told her he was State Champion before Beltik . Beth would play him on Board Two in the room with the sign reading " Top Boards . " Sizemore was n't there yet , but next to her , at Board One , Beltik was facing in her direction . Beth looked at him and then looked away . It was a few minutes before three . The lights in this smaller room  --  bare bulbs under a metal protection basket  --  seemed brighter than those in the big room , brighter than they had been in the morning , and for a moment the shine on the varnished floor with its painted red lines was blinding . Sizemore came in , combing his hair in a nervous , quick way . A cigarette hung from his thin lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself becoming very tight . " Ready ? " Sizemore asked gruffly , slipping the comb into his shirt pocket . " Yes , " she said and punched his clock . He played pawn to king four and then pulled out his comb and started biting on it the way a person bites on the eraser end of a pencil . Beth played pawn to queen bishop four . By the middle game Sizemore had begun combing his hair after each move . He hardly ever looked at Beth but concentrated on the board , wriggling in his seat sometimes as he combed and parted and reparted his hair . The game was even , and there were no weaknesses on either side . There was nothing to do but find the best squares for her knights and bishops and wait . She would move , write the move clown on her score sheet and sit back in her chair . After a while a crowd began to gather at the ropes . She glanced at them from time to time . There were more people watching her play than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for something to open up . Once when she looked up she saw Annette Packer standing at the hack . Packer smiled and Beth nodded to her Back at the board , Sizcmorr brought a knight to uuren five . nost-  | ing it in the best place for a knight . Beth frowned ; she could n't dislodge it . The pieces were thick in the middle of the board and for a moment she lost the sense of them . There were occasional twinges in her abdomen . She could feel the thick batch of paper between her thighs . She adjusted herself in her chair and squinted at the board . This was n't good . Sizemore was creeping up on her . She looked at his face . He had put away his comb and was looking at the pieces in front of him with satisfaction . Beth leaned over the table , digging her fists into her cheeks , and tried to penetrate the position . Some people in the crowd were whispering . With an effort she drove distractions from her mind . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight on the left ... No . If she opened the long diagonal for her white bishop ... That was it . She pushed the pawn up , and the bishop 's power was tripled . The picture started to become clearer . She leaned back in her seat and took a deep breath . During the next five moves Sizemore kept bringing pieces up , but Beth , seeing the limits to what he could do to her , kept her attention focused on the far left-hand corner of the board , on Sizemore 's queenside ; when the time came she brought her bishop down in the middle of his clustered pieces there , setting it on his knight two square . From where it sat now , two of his pieces could capture it , but if either did , he would be in trouble . She looked at him . He had taken out his comb again and was running it through his hair . His clock was ticking . It took him fifteen minutes to make the move , and when he did it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't he know he was a fool to move the rook off the back rank ? Could n't he see that ? She looked back at the board , double-checked the position and brought out her queen . He did n't see it until the move after next , and his game fell apart . He still had his comb in his hand six moves later when she got her queen 's pawn , passed , to the sixth rank . He brought his rook under the pawn . She attacked it with her bishop . Sizemore stood up , put his comb in his pocket , reached down to the board and set his king on its side . " You win , " he said grimly . The applause was thunderous . After she had turned in the score sheet she waited while the young man checked it , made a mark on a list in front of him , stood up and walked to the bulletin board . He took the pushpins from the card saying SIZEMORE and threw the card into a green metal wastebasket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised it to  | where Sizemore 's had been . The UNDEFEATED list now read : BELTIK , HARMON . When she was walking toward the girls ' room Beltik came out of " Top Boards " striding fast and looking very pleased with himself . He was carrying the little score sheet , on his way to the winners ' basket . He did n't seem to see Beth . She went over to the doorway of the ' Top Boards " room , and Townes was standing there . There were lines of fatigue in his face ; he looked like Rock Hudson , except for the weariness . " Good work , Harmon , " he said . " I 'm sorry you lost , " she said . " Yeah , " he said . " It 's back to the drawing board . " And then , nodding to where Beltik was standing at the front table with a small crowd gathered near him , he said , " He 's a killer , Harmon . A genuine killer . " She looked at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled down at her . " What I need , Harmon , is some of your talent . " As she passed the front table , Beltik took a step toward her and said , " Tomorrow . " When Beth came into the living room just before supper , Mrs. Wheatley looked pale and strange . She was sitting in the chintz armchair and her face was puffy . She was holding a brightly colored postcard in her lap . " I 've started menstruating , " Beth said . Mrs. Wheatley blinked . " That 's nice , " she said , as though from a great distance . " I 'll need some pads or something , " Beth said . Mrs. Wheatley seemed nonplused for a moment . Then she brightened . " That 's certainly a milepost for you . Why do n't you just go up to my room and look in the top drawer of my chiffonier ? Take all you require . " " Thank you , " Beth said , heading for the stairs . " And , dear , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green pills by my bedside . " When Beth came back she gave the pills to Mrs. Wheatley . Mrs. Wheatley had half a glass of beer sitting beside her ; she took out two of the pills and swallowed them with the beer . " My tranquillity needs to he refurbished , " she said . " Is something wrong ! " Beth asked .  | " I 'm not Aristotle , " Mrs. Wheatley said , " but it could be construed as wrong . I have received a message from Mr. Wheatley . " " What did he say ? " " Mr. Wheatley has been indefinitely detained in the Southwest . The American Southwest . " " Oh , " Beth said . " Between Denver and Butte . " Beth sat down on the sofa . " Aristotle was a moral philosopher , " Mrs. Wheatley said , " while I am a housewife . Or was a housewife . " " Ca n't they send me back if you do n't have a husband ? " " You put it concretely . " Mrs. Wheatley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie about it . " " That 's easy enough , " Beth said . " You 're a good soul , Beth , " Mrs. Wheatley said , finishing her beer . " Why do n't you heat the two chicken dinners in the freezer ? Set the oven at four hundred . " Beth had been holding two sanitary napkins in her right hand . " I do n't know how to put these on . " Mrs. Wheatley straightened herself up from her slumped position in the chair . " I am no longer a wife , " she said , " except by legal fiction . I believe I can learn to be a mother . I 'll show you how if you promise me never to go near Denver . " During the night Beth woke to hear rain on the roof over her head and intermittent rattling against the panes of her dormer windows . She had been dreaming of water , of herself swimming easily in a quiet ocean of still water . She put a pillow over her head and curled up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she could not . The rain was loud , and as it continued to fall , the sad languor of her dream was replaced by the image of a chessboard filled with pieces demanding her attention , demanding the clarity of her intelligence . It was two in the morning and she did not get back to sleep for the rest of the night . It was still raining when she went downstairs at seven ; the backyard outside the kitchen window looked like a swamp with hillocks of near-dead grass sticking up like islands . She was not certain how to fry eggs but decided she could boil some . She got two from the refrigerator , filled a pan with water and put it on the burner . She would play pawn to king four against him , and hope for the Sicilian . She boiled the eggs five minutes and put them in cold water . She could sec Beltik 's face , youthful , arrogant and smart . His  | eyes were small and black . When he stepped toward her yesterday as she was leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The eggs were perfect ; she opened them with a knife , put them in a cup and ate them with salt and butter . Her eyes were grainy under the lids . The final game would begin at eleven ; it was seven-twenty now . She wished she had a copy of Modern Chess Openings , to look over variations on the Sicilian . Some of the other players at the tournament had carried battered copies of the book under their arms . It was only drizzling when she left the house at ten , and Mrs. Wheatley was still upstairs asleep . Before she left , Beth went into the bathroom and checked the sanitary belt Mrs. Wheatley had given her to wear , and the thick white pad . It was all right . She put on her galoshes and her blue coat , got Mrs. Wheatley 's umbrella from the closet and left . She had noticed before that the pieces at Board One were different . They were solid wooden ones like Mr. Ganz 's and not the hollow plastic pieces that sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the table in the empty room at ten-thirty she reached out and picked up the white king . It was satisfyingly heavy , with a solid lead weight and green felt on the bottom . She placed the piece on its home square , stepped back over the velvet rope and walked to the girls ' room . She washed her face for the third time that day , tightened her sanitary belt , combed her bangs and went back to the gymnasium . More players had come in . She stuffed her hands into the pockets of her skirt so that no one could see they were trembling . When eleven o'clock came she was ready behind the white pieces at Board One . Boards Two and Three had already started their games . Sizemore was at Board Two . She did n't recognize the others . Ten minutes passed , and Beltik did not appear . The tournament director in the white shirt climbed over and stood near Beth for a minute . " Has n't shown yet ? " he said softly . Beth shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the director whispered . " You should have done it at eleven . " That annoyed her . No one had told her about that . She moved pawn to king four and started Beltik 's clock . It was ten inure minutes belorc Beltik came in . Beth 's stomach hurt and her eyes smarted . Beltik looked casual and relaxed , wearing a bright-red shirt and tour corduroy pants . " Sorry , " he said in a  | normal voice . " Extra cup of coffee . " The other players looked over at him with irritation . Beth said nothing . Beltik , still standing , loosened an extra button on his shirt front and held out his hand . " Harry Beltik , " he said . " What 's your name ? " He must know what her name was . " I 'm Beth Harmon , " she said , taking his hand but avoiding his eyes . He seated himself behind the black pieces , rubbed his hands together briskly and moved his king pawn to the third square . He punched Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never played it . She did n't like the look of it . The thing to do was play pawn to queen four . But what happened if he played the same ? Did she trade pawns or push one of them forward , or bring out her knight ? She squinted and shook her head ; it was difficult to picture what the board would look like after the moves . She looked again , rubbed her eyes , and played pawn to queen four . When she reached out to punch the clock she hesitated . Had she made a mistake ? But it was too late now . She pressed the button hastily and as it clicked down Beltik immediately picked up his queen pawn , put it on queen four and slapped down the button on his clock . Although it was difficult to see with her usual clarity , she had not lost her sense of the requirements of an opening . She brought out her knights and involved herself for a while in a struggle for the center squares . But Beltik , moving fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could n't capture the pawn he did it with . She tried to shrug off the advantage she 'd allowed and went on playing . She got her pieces off the back rank , and castled . She looked over the board at Beltik . He seemed completely at ease ; he was looking at the game going on next to them . Beth felt a knot in her stomach ; she could not get comfortable in her seat . The heavy cluster of pieces and pawns in the center of the board seemed for a while to have no pattern , to make no sense . Her clock was ticking . She inclined her head to look at its face ; twenty-five minutes were gone , and she was still down by a pawn . And Beltik had used only twenty-two minutes altogether , even including the time he 'd wasted by being late . There was a ringing in her ears , and the bright light in the room hurt her eyes . Beltik was leaning back with his arms outstretched , yawning , showing the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what looked like a good square for her knight , reached out her hand and then stopped . The move would be terrible ; somethad to be done about his mum brkwr he had it on the rook  | file and was ready to threaten . She had to protect and attack at the same time , and she could n't see how . The pieces in front of her just sat there . She should have taken a green pill last night , to make her sleep . Then she saw a move that looked sensible and quickly made it . She brought a knight back near the king , protecting herself against Beltik 's queen . He raised his eyebrows almost imperceptibly and immediately took a pawn on the other side of the board . There was suddenly a diagonal open for his bishop . The bishop was aimed at the knight she 'd wasted time bringing back , and she was down by another pawn . At the corner of Beltik 's mouth was a sly little smile . She quickly looked away from his face , frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over her king in four or five moves . She need to concentrate , to see it clearly . But when she looked at the board , everything was dense , interlocked , complicated , dangerous . Then she thought of something to do . With her clock still running she stood up , stepped over the rope and walked through the small crowd of silent spectators to the main gym floor and across it to the girls ' room . There was no one there . She went to a sink , washed her face with cold water , wet a handful of paper towels and held them for a minute to the back of her neck . After she threw them away she went into one of the little stalls and , sitting , checked her sanitary napkin . It was okay . She sat there relaxing , letting her mind go blank . Her elbows were on her knees , her head was bent down . With an effort of will she made the chessboard with the game on Board One on it appear in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was difficult , but not as difficult as some of the games she 'd memorized from the book at Morris ' Book Store . The pieces before her , in her imagination , were crisp and sharply focused . She stayed where she was , not worrying about time , until she had it penetrated and understood . Then she got up , washed her face again and walked back into the gym . She had found her move . There were more people gathered in " Top Boards " than before ; as games ended they came in to watch the finals . She pushed by them , stepped over the rope and sat down . Her hands were perfectly steady , and her stomach and eyes felt fine . She reached out and moved ; she punched the clock firmly . Belt ik studied the move fine a Few minutes and took her knight with his bishop , as she knew he would . She did not retake ; she hrnu , hl : hiahou liver lo al ; u k uur of him rrviki 1-1r ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the line of fire . He had to . She felt the blood rush into her cheeks as she brought her queen from the back to the center of the board . It now threatened to take the rook , pinned the king 's knight pawn and could take the bishop with a check . She looked at Beltik . He was studying the board and rolling up his sleeves . His clock was ticking . It took him almost fifteen minutes to find the rook move that Beth , in the bathroom , had been certain he would make . She was ready . Her rook came over behind her queen and she heard Beltik take in his breath sharply . Someone in the crowd began to whisper . Beth waited . After ten more minutes Beltik moved his queen into a defensive position . It would n't work . She reached out with her hand steady and her mind crystalline and advanced a pawn , attacking his queen . Beltik stared at the pawn for a moment as though it were a cockroach on the board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned , unable to move . If he moved his queen away , Beth would begin a series of threats . If he left it where it was , he would lose it . " Son of a bitch ! " he whispered . By the time he had decided what to do , there were only ten more minutes on his clock . Beth had fifty . He had wasted his time stretching his arms and wriggling in his chair and distorting his face and , every now and then , starting out as if he knew what to do and then stopping , his hand arrested in midair over a piece . Finally he picked up the queen and moved it across the board , out of harm 's way . She brought up a bishop behind her queen : the threat was checkmate , and he was forced to parry it with his queen . She ignored the queen when he brought it over and pushed her rook to the third rank , where it was free to move either right or left . She would get either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beltik was bent over the board with his face on his open palms . She could hear his foot tapping . " Son of a bitch , " he said . " Son of a bitch . " Beth spoke softly . " I think that 's it . " " I can get out of this . " " I do n't think so , " Beth said . He had four more minutes on his clock . He kept staring at the board as though he were going to destroy it with the intensity of ' his desire to find some way out of the trap . Finally , with thirty seconds left , he grabbed his queen and slammed it in front of the rook , interposing and offering to sacrifice the queen for the rook . Ile slapped  | the button down on his clock , leaned back in his chair and drew a deep breath . " It does n't work , " Beth said . " I do n't have to take the queen . " " Move , " Beltik said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Move ! " She nodded and checked with the bishop . Beltik , with his clock ticking , quickly moved his king away and pressed the button . Then Beth did what she had planned all along . She brought her queen crashing down next to the king , sacrificing it . Beltik looked at her , stunned . She stared back at him . He shrugged , snatched up the queen and stopped his clock by hitting it with the base of the captured piece . Beth pushed her other bishop from the back rank out to the middle of the board and said , " Check . Mate next move . " Beltik stared at it for a moment , said , " Son of a bitch ! " and stood up . " The rook mates , " Beth said . " Son of a bitch , " Beltik said . The crowd that had now filled the room began applauding . Beltik , still scowling , held out his hand , and Beth shook it .  | THEY WERE READY TO CLOSE BY THE TIME SHE GOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus after school and wait again transferring down Main . And this was the second bank . She 'd carried the folded check in her blouse pocket all day , under the sweater . It was in her hand when the man in front of her picked up his rolls of nickels and stuffed them in the pocket of his overcoat and left the space at the window for her . She set her hand on the cold marble , holding the check out and standing on tiptoe , to be able to see the face of the teller . " I 'd like to open an account , " Beth said . The man glanced at the check . " How old are you , miss ? " " Thirteen . " " I 'm sorry , " he said . " You 'll need a parent or guardian with you . " Beth put the check back in her blouse pocket and left . At the house , Mrs. Wheatley had four empty Pabst Blue Ribbon beer bottles sitting on the little table by her chair . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper from the front porch ; she unfolded it as she came into the living room . " How was school , dear ? " Mrs. Wheatley 's voice was dim and far away . " It was okay . " As Beth set the newspaper on the green plastic hassock by the sofa she saw with quiet astonishment that her own  | picture was printed on the front page , at the bottom . Near the top was the face of Nikita Khrushchev and at the bottom , one column wide , was her face , scowling beneath a headline : LOCAL PRODIGY TAKES CHESS TOURNEY . Under this , in smaller letters , boldface : TWELVE-YEAR-OLD ASTONISHES EXPERTS . She remembered the man taking her picture before they gave her the trophy and the check . She had told him she was thirteen . Beth bent over , reading the paper : The world of Kentucky Chess was astonished this weekend by the playing of a local girl , who triumphed over hardened players to win the Kentucky State Championship . Elizabeth Harmon , a seventhgrade student at Fairfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any female " according to Harry Beltik , whom Miss Harmon defeated for the state crown . Beth grimaced ; she hated the picture of herself . It showed her freckles and her small nose all too clearly . " I want to open a bank account , " she said . " A bank account ? " " You 'll have to go with me . " " But , my dear , " Mrs. Wheatley said , " what would you open a bank account with ? " Beth reached into her blouse pocket , took out the check and handed it to her . Mrs. Wheatley sat up in her chair and held the check in her hand as though it were a Dead Sea Scroll . She was silent for a moment , reading it . Then she said softly , " One hundred dollars . " " I need a parent or guardian . At the bank . " " One hundred dollars . " Mrs. Wheatley said . " Then you won it ? " " Yes . It says First Place ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheatley said . " I had n't the foggiest idea people made money playing chess . " " Some tournaments have bigger prizes than that . " " Goodness ! " Mrs. Wheatley was still staring at the check . " We can go to the bank after school tomorrow . " " Certainly , " Mrs. Wheatley said . The next day , when they came into the living room after the bank , there was a copy of Chess Review on the cobbler 's bench in front of ' the sofa . Mrs. Wheatley hung her coat in the hall closet and picked up the magazine . " While you were at school , " she said , " I was leafing through this . I see there 's a major tournament in Cincin-  | nati the second week in December . First prize is five hundred dollars . " Beth studied her for a long moment . " I have to be in school then , " she said . " And Cincinnati 's pretty far from here . " " The Greyhound bus requires only two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took the liberty of calling . " " What about school ? " Beth said . " I can write a medical excuse , claiming mono . " " Mono ? " " Mononucleosis . It 's quite the thing in your age group , according to the Ladies ' Home Journal . " Beth kept looking at her , trying not to let the astonishment show in her face . Mrs. Wheatley 's dishonesty seemed in every way to match her own . Then she said , " Where would we stay ? " " At the Gibson Hotel , in a double room at twenty-two dollars a night . The Greyhound tickets will be eleven-eighty apiece , and there will , of course , be the cost of food . I have calculated all of it . Even if you win second or third prize , there will be a profit . " Beth had twenty dollars in cash and a packet of ten checks in her plastic purse . " I need to buy some chess books , " she said . " By all means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll make out a check for twenty-three dollars and sixty cents , I 'll get the bus tickets tomorrow . " After buying Modern Chess Openings and a book on the endgame at Morris ' , Beth walked across the street to Purcell 's Department Store . She knew from the way girls talked at school that Purcell 's was better than Ben Snyder 's . She found what she wanted on the fourth floor : a wooden set almost identical to the one Mr. Ganz owned , with hand-carved knights and big , substantial pawns , and rooks that were fat and solid . She was undecided for a while over the board and almost bought a wooden one before settling on a folding linen board with green and beige squares . It would be more portable than the other . Back home she cleared off her desk , put the board on it and set up the pieces . She piled her new chessbooks on one side and placed the tall silver trophy in the shape of a chess king on the other . She turned on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pieces , at the way their curves picked up the light . She sat for what seemed like a long time , her mind quiet . Then she picked up Modern Chess Openings . This time she began at the beginning .  | She had never seen anything like the Gibson Hotel before . Its size and bustle , the bright chandeliers in its lobby , the heavy red carpeting , the flowers , even the three revolving doors and the uniformed doorman who stood beside them were overwhelming . She and Mrs. Wheatley walked up to the front of the hotel from the bus station , carrying their new luggage . Mrs. Wheatley refused to hand it over to the doorman . She lugged her suitcase up to the front desk and registered for them both , unperturbed by the look the room clerk gave them . In the room afterward , Beth began to relax . There were two big windows overlooking Fourth Street with its rush hour traffic . It was a crisp , cold day outside . Inside they had this thick-carpeted room with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plateglass mirror covering one wall . There was a color TV on the dresser and a bright-red bedspread on each of the beds . Mrs. Wheatley was inspecting the room , checking the dresser drawers , clicking the TV on and off , patting away a wrinkle on the bedspread . " Well , " she said , " I asked them for a pleasant room , and I believe they gave it to me . " She seated herself in the high-backed Victorian chair by her bed as though she had lived in the Gibson Hotel all her life . The tournament was on the mezzanine in the Taft Room ; all Beth had to do was take the elevator . Mrs. Wheatley found them a diner down the street where they had bacon and eggs for breakfast , then she went back to bed with a copy of the Cincinnati Enquirer and a pack of Chesterfields while Beth went down to the tournament and registered . She still did not have a rating , but this time one of the men at the desk knew who she was ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section . There would be two games a day , and the time control would be 120/40 , which meant you had two hours to make forty moves . While she was signing in , she could hear a deep voice coming through one of the double doors that stood open to the Taft Room , where the games would be . She looked that way and saw part of the big ballroom , with a long row of empty tables and a few men walking around . When she walked in , she saw a strange man slouched on a sofa with black-booted feet resting on a coffee table . " ... and the rook comes to the seventh rank , " he was saying . " Bone in the throat , man , that rook there . Ile took one look at it and paid up . " He leaned his head against the back of the sofa and laughed loudly in a deep baritone . " " 1'wenty bucks . "  | Since it was early , there were only half a dozen people in the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with paper chessboards on them . Everyone was listening to the man talking . He was about twenty-five and looked like a pirate . He wore dirty jeans , a black turtleneck and a black wool cap pulled down to his heavy eyebrows . He had a thick black mustache and clearly needed a shave ; the backs of his hands were tanned and scraped-looking . " The Caro-Kann Defense , " he said , laughing . " A genuine bummer . " " What 's wrong with the Caro-Kann ? " someone asked . A neat young man in a camel 's hair sweater . " All pawns and no hope . " He lowered his legs to the floor and sat up . On the table was a soiled old beige-and-green chessboard with battered wooden pieces on it . The head had fallen off the black king at some time or other ; it was held on with a piece of gritty adhesive tape . " I 'll show you , " the man said , sliding the board over . Beth was now standing next to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man reached down to the board and with surprising delicacy picked up the white king pawn with his fingertips and dropped it lightly on king four . Then he picked up the black queen bishop pawn and dropped it on queen 's bishop three , put White 's queen pawn on the fourth rank and did the same with Black 's . He looked up at the people around him , who were by now all paying close attention . " The Caro-Kann . Right ? " Beth was familiar with these moves , but she had never seen them played . She expected the man to move the white queen 's knight next , and he did . Then he had the black pawn capture the white , and took the capturing pawn with the white knight . He played Black 's king knight to bishop three and brought White 's other knight out . Beth remembered the move . Looking at it now , it seemed tame . She found herself speaking up . " I 'd take the knight , " she said quietly . The man looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that kid from Kentucky  --  the one who wiped out Harry Beltik ? " " Yes , " Beth said . " If you take the knight , it doubles his pawns ... " " Big deal , " the man said . " All pawns and no hope . Here 's how to win with Black . " He left the knight in the center of the board and played Black 's pawn to king four . Then he continued laying out the moves of a game , shuffling the pieces around on the board with casual dexterity , occasionally pointing out a potential trap . The game  | built to a balanced fugue in the center . It was like time-lapse photography on TV where a pale-green stalk humps itself from dirt , heightens , swells and explodes into a peony or a rose . Some other people had come into the room and were watching . Beth was feeling a new kind of excitement with this display , with the knowingness , the clarity and nerve of the man in the black cap . He began trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board with his fingertips as though they were dead flies , keeping up a soft-voiced patter that pointed out necessities and weaknesses , pitfalls and strengths . Once , when he had to reach across the board to the back rank and move a rook from its home square , she was astonished to see as he stretched his body that he was carrying a knife at his waist . The leather-and-metal handle protruded above his belt . He looked so much like someone out of Treasure Island that the knife did not seem at all out of place . Just then he paused in his moving and said , " Now watch this , " and brought the black rook up to its king five square , setting it down with a muted flourish . He folded his arms across his chest . " What does White do here ? " he asked , looking around him . Beth considered the board . There were pitfalls all over for white . One of the men watching spoke up . " Queen takes pawn ? " The man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king eight check . And the queen falls . " Beth had seen that . It looked to be all over for the white pieces and she started to say so when another man spoke up . " That 's Mieses-Reshevsky . From the thirties . " The man looked up at him . " You 've got it , " he said . " Margate . Nineteen thirty-five . " " White played rook to queen one , " the first man said . " Right , " said the other . " What else has he got ? " He made the move and continued . It was clear now that White was losing . There were some fast trades and then an endgame that looked for a moment as though it might be slow , but Black made a striking sacrifice of a passed pawn and abruptly the topology of pawn-queening made it clear that Black would have a queen two moves before White . It was a dazzling game , like some of the best ones Beth had learned from books . ' I'hc man stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at Beth for a moment . " Reshevsky was playing like that when he was your age , little girl . Younger . "  | Back in the room Mrs. Wheatley was still reading the Enquirer . She looked over her reading glasses at Beth as she came in the door . " Finished already ? " she said . " Yes . " " How did you do ? " " I won . " Mrs. Wheatley smiled warmly . " Honey , " she said , " you are a treasure . " Mrs. Wheatley had seen an ad about a sale at Shillito 's  --  a department store a few blocks from the Gibson . Since there were four hours before Beth 's next game , they went over , through lightly falling snow , and Mrs. Wheatley rummaged in the basement awhile until Beth said , " I 'd like to look at their sweaters . " " What kind of sweaters , dear ? " " Cashmere . " Mrs. Wheatley 's eyebrows went up . " Cashmere ? Are you sure we can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale-gray sweater on sale for twenty-four dollars , and it fit her perfectly . Looking in the tall mirror , she tried to imagine herself as a member of the Apple Pi Club , like Margaret ; but the face was still Beth 's face , round and freckled , with straight brown hair . She shrugged and bought the sweater with a traveler 's check . They had passed an elegant little shoe store with saddle oxfords in the window on the way to Shillito 's and she took Mrs. Wheatley there and bought herself a pair . Then she bought argyle socks to go with them . The tag said : " 100% wool . Made in England . " Going back to the hotel through a wind that whipped tiny snowflakes against her , Beth kept looking down at her new shoes and high plaid socks . She liked the way her feet felt , liked the tightness of the warm socks against her calves , and liked the way they looked  --  bright expensive socks above bright brown-and-white shoes . She kept looking down . That afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1910 . She played the Sicilian and forced him to resign after an hour and a half . Her mind was as clear as it had ever been , and she was able to use some of the things she had learned over the past weeks from studying her new book by the Russian Master Boleslayski.  | When she turned in her score sheet Sizemore was standing near the desk . She saw a few other familiar faces from that tournament , and it felt good to see them , but she really wanted to see only one player from before Townes . She looked several times but did n't find him . Back in their room that evening , Mrs. Wheatley watched The Beverly Hillbillies and The Dick Van Dyke Show , while Beth set up and went over her two games , looking for weaknesses in her play . There were n't any . Then she got out the book by Reuben Fine on endgames and began studying . The endgame in chess had its own feeling ; it was like an altogether different contest , once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the question became one of queening a pawn . It could be agonizingly subtle ; there was no chance for the kind of violent attack Beth loved . But she was bored with Reuben Fine , and after a while she closed the book and went to bed . She had two of the little green pills in her pajama pocket , and she took them after the lights were off . She did n't want to risk not sleeping . The second day was as easy as the first , even though Beth was matched against stronger players . It had taken her a while to clear her head from the effect of the pills , but by the time she started playing her mind was sharp . She even handled the pieces themselves with confidence , picking them up and setting them down with aplomb . There was no " Top Boards " room at this tournament . Board One was merely the first board at the first table . For the second game Beth was at Board Six , and people were gathered around her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooks . When she looked up during the applause , there stood Alma Wheatley at the back of the room smiling broadly . In her final game , at Board One , Beth was playing a master named Rudolph . He managed to start trading pieces in the center during the middle game , and Beth was alarmed to find herself crowded into an ending with a rook , a knight and three pawns . Rudolph had the same thing , except for a bishop where she had a knight . She did n't like it , and his bishop was a distinct advantage . But she managed to pin it and trade her knight for it and then play with great care for an hour and a half until Rudolph made a blunder and she zeroed in on it . She checked with a pawn , traded rooks and got one of her pawns passed with the king protecting . Rudolph looked furious at himself and resigned .  | There was strong applause . Beth looked at the crowd around the table . Near the back , in her blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Going back to the room , Mrs. Wheatley carried the heavy trophy and Beth had the check in her blouse pocket . Mrs. Wheatley had written it all out on a sheet of hotel stationery that sat on top of the TV : sixty-six dollars for three days at the Gibson , plus three-thirty tax ; twenty-three sixty for the bus , and the price of each meal , including tip . " I 've allowed twelve dollars for our celebration supper tonight and two dollars for a small breakfast tomorrow . That makes our total expenses equal one seventy-two thirty . " " It leaves over three hundred dollars , " Beth said . There was a silence for a while . Beth looked at the sheet of paper , although she understood it perfectly well . She was wondering if she should offer to split the money with Mrs. Wheatley . She did not want to do that . She had won it herself . Mrs. Wheatley broke the silence . " Perhaps you could give me ten percent , " she said pleasantly . " As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beth said , " and seventy-seven cents . " " They told me at Methuen that you were marvelous at math . " Beth nodded . " Okay , " she said . They had something with veal in it at an Italian restaurant . Mrs. Wheatley ordered herself a carafe of red wine and drank it and smoked Chesterfields throughout the meal . Beth liked the bread and the cold , pale butter . She liked the little tree with oranges on it that sat on the bar , not far from their table . Mrs. Wheatley wiped her chin with her napkin when she finished the wine and lit a final cigarette . " Beth , dear , " she said , " there 's a tournament in Houston over the holidays , starting the twenty-sixth . I understand it 's very easy to travel on Christmas Day , since most people are eating plum pudding or whatever . " " I saw , " Beth said . She had read the ad in Chess Review and wanted very much to go . But Houston had seemed awfully far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could fly to Houston , " Mrs. Wheatley said brightly . " We could have a pleasant winter vacation in the sun . " Beth was finishing her spumoni . " Okay , " she said and then , looking down at the ice cream , " Okay , Mother . " " Their Christmas dinner was microwave turkey served on an airplane , with a complimentary glass of champagne for Mrs. Wheatley  | and canned orange juice for Beth . It was the best Christmas she had ever had . The plane flew over a snow-covered Kentucky and , at the end of the trip , circled out above the Gulf of Mexico . They landed in warm air and sunshine . Driving in from the airport , they passed one construction site after the other , the big yellow cranes and bulldozers standing idle near stacks of girders . Someone had hung a Christmas wreath on one of them . A week before they left Lexington a new copy of Chess Review had come in the mail . When Beth opened it she found a small picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headline : SCHOOLGIRL TAKES KENTUCKY CHAMPIONSHIP FROM MASTER . Their game was printed and the commentary said : " Onlookers were amazed at her youthful mastery of the fine points of strategy . She shows the assurance of players twice her age . " She read it twice before showing it to Mrs. Wheatley . Mrs. Wheatley was ecstatic ; she had read the article in the Lexington paper aloud and then said " Wonderful ! " This time she read in silence before saying , " This is national recognition , dear , " in a hushed voice . Mrs. Wheatley had brought the magazine with her , and they spent part of the time on the plane marking the tournaments Beth would play over the next several months . They settled on one a month ; Mrs. Wheatley was afraid they would run out of diseases and , as she said , " credibility " if she wrote more excuses than that . Beth wondered to herself if they should n't just ask for permission in a straightforward way  --  after all , boys were allowed to miss classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say nothing . Mrs. Wheatley seemed to take immense enjoyment in doing it this way . It was like a conspiracy . She won in Houston without any trouble . She was , as Mrs. Wheatley said , really " getting the hang of it . " She was forced to draw her third game but took the final one by a dazzling combination , beating the forty-year-old Southwest Champion as though he were a beginner . They stayed over two days " for the sun " and visited the Museum of Fine Arts and the Zoological Gardens . On the day after the tournament Beth 's picture was in the paper , and this time it made her feel good to see it . The article called her a " Wunderkind . " Mrs. Wheatley bought three copies , saying , " I just might start a scrapbook . " In January , Mrs. Wheatley called the school to say that Beth had a relapse of mono , and t hey went to Charleston . In February it was Atlanta and a cold ; in March , Miami and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assistant Principal and sometimes to the Dean of Girls . No one questioned the excuses . It seemed likely that some of the students knew about her from out-of-town papers or something , but no one in authority said anything . Beth worked on her chess for three hours every evening between tournaments . She lost one game in Atlanta but still came in first , and she stayed undefeated in the other two cities . She enjoyed flying with Mrs. Wheatley , who sometimes became comfortably buzzed by martinis on the planes . They talked and giggled together . Mrs. Wheatley said funny things about the stewardesses and their beautifully pressed jackets and bright , artificial make-up , or talked about how silly some of her neighbors in Lexington were . She was high-spirited and confidential and amusing , and Beth would laugh a long time and look out the window at the clouds below them and feel better than she had ever felt , even during those times at Methuen when she had saved up her green pills and taken five or six at once . She grew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tournament and winning it , moving up gradually game by game and having the crowd around her table increase with each win . People at tournaments knew who she was now . She was always the youngest there , and sometimes the only female . Back at school afterward things seemed more and more drab . Some of the other students talked about going to college after high school , and some had professions in mind . Two girls she knew wanted to be nurses . Beth never participated in these conversations ; she already was what she wanted to be . But she talked to no one about her traveling or about the reputation she was building in tournament chess . When they came back from Miami in March , there was an envelope from the Chess Federation in the mail . In it was a new membership card with her rating : 1881 . She had been told it would take time for the rating to reflect her real strength ; she was satisfied for now to be , finally , a rated player . She would push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Master , at 2200 . After 2000 they called you an Expert , but that did n't mean much . The one she liked was International Grandmaster ; that had weight to it . That summer they went to New York to play at the Henry Hudson Hotel . They had developed a taste for fine food , though at home it was mostly TV dinners , and in New York they ate at French restaurants , taking buses crosstown to Lc Bistro and Cafe Argenteuil . Mrs. Wheatley had gone to a gas station in Lexington and bought a Mobil 7iavel Guide ; she picked places with three or more stars , and then  | they found them with the little map . It was terribly expensive , but neither of them said a word about the cost . Beth would eat smoked trout but never fresh fish ; she remembered the fish she 'd had to eat on Fridays at Methuen . She decided that next year at school she would take French . The only problem was that , on the road , she took the pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and sometimes it required an hour or so to get her head clear in the morning . But tournament games never started before nine , and she made a point of getting up in time to have several cups of coffee from room service . Mrs. Wheatley did not know about the pills and showed no concern over Beth 's appetite for coffee ; she treated her in every way like an adult . Sometimes it seemed as though Beth were the older of the two . Beth loved New York . She liked riding on the bus , and she liked taking the IRT subway with its grit and rattle . She liked window shopping when she had a chance , and she enjoyed hearing people on the street talking Yiddish or Spanish . She did not mind the sense of danger in the city or the arrogant way the taxis drove or the dirty glitter of Times Square . They went to Radio City Music Hall on their last night and saw West Side Story and the Rockettes . Sitting high in the cavernous theater in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter from Life to be someone who chainsmoked and looked like Lloyd Nolan , but the person who came to the door of the house was a small woman with steel-gray hair and a dark dress . The man with her was carrying a camera . She introduced herself as Jean Balke . She looked older than Mrs. Wheatley , and she walked around the living room with quick little movements , hastily checking out the books in the bookcase and studying some of the prints on the walls . Then she began asking questions . Her manner was pleasant and direct . " I 've really been impressed , " she said , " even though I do n't play chess myself . " She smiled . " They say you 're the real thing . " Beth was a little embarrassed . " How does it feel ? Being a girl among all those men ? " " I do n't mind it . " " Is n't it frightening ? " They were sitting facing each other . Miss Balke leaned forward , looking intently at Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sofa and began taking readings with a meter .  | " When I was a girl , " the reporter said , " I was never allowed to be competitive . I used to play with dolls . " The photographer backed off and began to study Beth through his camera . She remembered the doll Mr. Ganz had given her . " Chess is n't always competitive , ' " she said . " But you play to win . " Beth wanted to say something about how beautiful chess was sometimes , but she looked at Miss Balke 's sharp , inquiring face and could n't find the words for it . " Do you have a boyfriend ? " " No . I 'm fourteen . " The photographer began snapping pictures . Miss Balke had lighted a cigarette . She leaned forward now and tapped the ashes into one of Mrs. Wheatley 's ashtrays . " Are you interested in boys ? " she asked . Beth was feeling more and more uneasy . She wanted to talk about learning chess and about the tournaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not like this woman and did not like her questions . " I 'm interested in chess mostly . " Miss Balke smiled brightly . " Tell me about it , " she said . " Tell me how you learned to play and how old you were . " Beth told her and Miss Balke took notes , but Beth felt that she was n't really interested in any of it . She found as she went on talking that she really had very little to say . The next week at school , during algebra class , Beth saw the boy in front of her pass a copy of Life to the girl next to him , and they both turned and looked back at her as though they had never seen her before . After class the boy , who had never spoken to her before , stopped her and asked if she would autograph the magazine . Beth was stunned . She took it from him and there it was , filling a full page . There was a picture of her looking serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main building at Methuen . Across the top of the page a headline read : A GIRL MOZART STARTLES THE WORLD OF CHESS . She signed her name with the boy 's ball-point pen , setting the magazine on an empty desk . When she got home , Mrs. Wheatley had the magazine in her lap . She began reading aloud : " With some people chess is a pastime , with others it is a compulsion , even an addiction . And every now and then a person comes along for whom it is a birthright . Now and then a small boy appears and dazzles us with his precocity at what may 1w the world 's most difficult game . But what if that boy were a girl a young , unsmiling uirl with hmwn eves ihrnwn hair and a dark-blue dress . '  | " It has never happened before , but it happened recently . In Lexington , Kentucky , and in Cincinnati . In Charleston , Atlanta , Miami , and lately in New York City . Into the male-dominated world of the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , from eighth grade at Fairfield Junior High in Lexington , Kentucky . She is quiet and well-mannered . And she is out for blood . . . ' It 's marvelous ! " Mrs. Wheatley said . " Shall I read on ? " " It talks about the orphanage . " Beth had bought her own copy . " And it gives one of my games . But it 's mostly about my being a girl . " " Well , you are one . " " It should n't be that important , " Beth said . " They did n't print half the things I told them . They did n't tell about Mr. Shaibel . They did n't say anything about how I play the Sicilian . " " But , Beth , " Mrs. Wheatley said , " it makes you a celebrity ! " Beth looked at her thoughtfully , " For being a girl , mostly , " she said . The next day Margaret stopped her in the hall . Margaret was wearing a camel's-hair coat and her blond hair fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she had been a year before , when Beth had taken the ten dollars from her purse . " The other Apple Pi 's asked me to invite you , " Margaret said respectfully . " We 're having a pledge party Friday night at my house . " The Apple Pi 's . It was very strange . When Beth accepted and asked for the address she realized it was the first time she had ever actually spoken to Margaret . She spent over an hour that afternoon trying on dresses at Purcell 's before picking a navy-blue with a simple white collar from the store 's most expensive line . When she showed it to Mrs. Wheatley that evening and told her she was going to the Apple Pi Club , Mrs. Wheatley was clearly pleased . " You look just like a debutante ! " she said when Beth tried on the dress for her . The white woodwork of Margaret 's living room glistened beautifully and the pictures on the walls were oil paintings  --  mostly of horses . Even though it was a mild evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel . Fourteen girls were sitting on the white sofas and colored wingback chairs when Beth arrived in her new dress . Most of ' the others were wearing sweaters and skirts . " It was really something , " one of them said , " to find a face from Fairfield  | Junior High in Life . I nearly flipped ! " but when Beth started to talk about the tournaments , the girls interrupted her to ask about the boys at them . Were they good-looking ? Did she date any of them ? When Beth said , " There 's not much time for that , " the girls changed the subject . For an hour or more they talked about boys and dating and clothes , veering erratically from cool sophistication to giggles , while Beth sat uneasily at one end of a sofa holding a crystal glass of Coca-Cola , unable to think of anything to say . Then , at nine o'clock , Margaret turned on the huge television set by the fireplace and they were all quiet , except for an occasional giggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beth sat through it , not participating in the gossip and laughter during the commercials , until it ended at eleven . She was astounded at the dullness of the evening . This was the elite Apple Pi Club that had seemed so important when she first went to school in Lexington , and this was what they did at their sophisticated parties : they watched a Charles Bronson movie . The only break in the dullness was when a girl named Felicia said , " I wonder if he 's as well-hung as he looks . " Beth laughed at that , but it was the only thing she laughed at . When she left after eleven no one urged her to stay , and no one said anything about her joining . She was relieved to get into the taxi and go home , and when she got there she spent an hour in her room with The Middle Game in Chess , translated from the Russian of D. Luchenko . The school knew about her , well enough , by the next tournament , and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheatley talked to the principal , and Beth was excused from her classes . Nothing was said about the illnesses she had lied about . They wrote her up in the school paper , and people pointed her out in the hallways . The tournament was in Kansas City , and after she won it the director took her and Mrs. Wheatley to a steakhouse for dinner and told her they were honored to have her participate . He was a serious young man , and he treated both of them politely . " I 'd like to play in the U.S. Open , " Beth said over dessert and coffee . " Sure , " he said . " You might win it . " " Would t hat lead to playing abroad ? " Mrs. Wheatley asked . " In Europe , I mean ? " " No reason why nut , " the young man said . Ells name was Nobile ? .  | He wore thick glasses and kept drinking ice water . " They have to know about you before they invite you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure . Benny Watts plays in Europe all the time , now that he 's got his international title . " " How 's the prize money ? " Mrs. Wheatley asked , lighting a cigarette . " Pretty good , I think . " " What about Russia ? " Beth said . Nobile stared at her a minute , as though she had suggested something illicit . " Russia 's murder , " he said finally . " They eat Americans for breakfast over there . " " Now , really . . . " Mrs. Wheatley said . " They really do , " Nobile said . " I do n't think there 's been an American with a prayer against the Russians for twenty years . It 's like ballet . They pay people to play chess . " Beth thought of those pictures in Chess Review , of the men with grim faces , bending over chessboards  --  Borgov and Tal , Laev and Shapkin , scowling , wearing dark suits . Chess in Russia was a different thing than chess in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Open ? " " Just send in an entry fee , " Nobile said . " It 's like any other tournament , except the competition 's stiffer . " She sent in her entry fee , but she did not play in the U.S. Open that year . Mrs. Wheatley developed a virus that kept her in bed for two weeks , and Beth , who had just passed her fifteenth birthday , was unwilling to go alone . She did her best to hide it , but she was furious at Alma Wheatley for being sick , and at herself for being afraid to make the trip to Los Angeles . The Open was not as important as the U.S. Championship , but it was time she started playing in something other than events chosen solely on the basis of the prize money . There was a tight little world of tournaments like the United States Championship and the Merriwether Invitational that she knew of through overheard conversations and from articles in Chess Review ; it was time she got into it , and then into international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to become ; a truly professional woman and the finest chessplayer in the world , traveling confidently by herself in the first-class cabins of airplanes , tall , perfectly dressed , good-looking and poised  --  a kind of white Jolene . She often told herself that she would send Jolene a card or a letter , but she never did . Instead she would study herself in  | the bathroom mirror , looking for signs of that poised and beautiful woman she wanted to become . At sixteen she had grown taller and better-looking , had learned to have her hair cut in a way that showed her eyes to some advantage , but she still looked like a schoolgirl . She played tournaments about every six weeks now  --  in states like Illinois and Tennessee , and sometimes in New York . They still chose ones that would pay enough to show a profit after the expenses for the two of them . Her bank account grew , and that was a considerable pleasure , but somehow her career seemed to be on a plateau . And she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALTHOUGH THE U.S. OPEN WAS BEING HELD IN LAS VEGAS , THE other people at the Mariposa Hotel seemed oblivious to it . In the main room the players at the craps tables , at roulette and at the blackjack tables wore brightly colored double-knits and shirts ; they went about their business in silence . On the other side of the casino was the hotel coffee shop . The day before the tournament Beth walked down an aisle between crapshooters where the main sound was the tapping of clay chips and of dice on felt . In the coffee shop she slid onto a stool at the counter , turned around to look at the mostly empty booths and saw a handsome young man sitting hunched over a cup of coffee , alone . It was Townes , from Lexington . She stood up and went over to the booth . " Hello , " she said . He looked up and blinked , not recognizing her at first . Then he said , " Harmon ! For Christ 's sake ! " " Can I sit down ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known you . You were on the list . " " The list ? " " The tournament list . I 'm not playing . Chess Review sent me to write it up . " He looked at her . " I could write you up . For the Herald-Leader . " " Lexington ? " " You got it . You 've grown a lot , Harmon . I saw the piece in  | Life . " He looked at her closely . " You 've even gotten good-looking . " She felt flustered and did not know what to say . Everything about Las Vegas was strange . On the table in each booth was a lamp with a glass base filled with purple liquid that bubbled and swirled below its bright pink shade . The waitress who handed her a menu was dressed in a black miniskirt and fishnet hose , but she had the face of a geometry teacher . Townes was handsome , smiling , dressed in a dark sweater with a striped shirt open at the throat . She chose the Mariposa Special : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bottomless Cup of coffee . " I could do half a page on you for the Sunday paper , " Townes was saying . The hot cakes and eggs came , and Beth ate them and drank two cups of coffee . " I 've got a camera in my room , " Townes said . He hesitated . " I 've got chessboards , too . Do you want to play ? " She shrugged . " Okay . Let 's go up . " " Terrific ! " His smile was dazzling . The drapes were open , with a view of a parking lot . The bed was huge and unmade . It seemed to fill the room . There were three chessboards set up : one on a table by the window , one on the bureau , and the third in the bathroom next to the basin . He posed her by the window and shot a roll of film while she sat at . the board and moved the pieces . It was difficult not to look at him as he walked around . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meter near her face , she found herself catching her breath at the sensation of warmth from his body . Her heart was beating fast , and when she reached out to move a rook she saw that her fingers were trembling . He clicked off the last shot and began rewinding the film . " One of those should do it , " he said . He set the camera on the nightstand by the bed . " Let 's play chess . " She looked at him . " I do n't know what your first name is . " " Everyone calls me Townes , " he said . " Maybe that 's why I call you Harmon . Instead of Elizabeth . " She began setting up the pieces on the board . " It 's Beth . " " I 'd rather call you Harmon . " " Let 's play skittles , " she said . " You can play White . " Skittles was speed chess , and there was n't time for much complexity . He got his chess clock from the bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I should give you three , " he said . " Go ahead , " Beth said , not looking at him . She wished he would just come over and touch her  --  on the arm maybe , or put his hand  | on her cheek . He seemed terribly sophisticated , and his smile was easy . He could n't be thinking about her the way she was thinking about him . But Jolene had said , " They all think about it , honey . That 's just what they think about . " And they were alone in his room , with the king-sized bed . In Las Vegas . When he set the clock at the side of the board , she saw they both had the same amount of time . She did not want to play this game with him . She wanted to make love with him . She punched the button on her side , and his clock started ticking . He moved pawn to king four and pushed his button . She held her breath for a moment and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room Mrs. Wheatley was sitting in bed , smoking a cigarette and looking mournful . " Where 've you been , honey ? " she said . Her voice was quiet and had some of the strain it had when she spoke of Mr. Wheatley . " Playing chess , " Beth said . " Practicing . " There was a copy of Chess Review on the television set . Beth got it and opened it to the masthead page . His name was n't among the editors , but down below , under " Correspondents , " were three names ; the third was D. L. Townes . She still did n't know his first name . After a moment Mrs. Wheatley said , " Would you hand me a can of beer ? On the dresser . " Beth stood up . Five cans of Pabst were on one of the brown trays room service used , and a half-eaten bag of potato chips . " Why do n't you have one yourself ? " Mrs. Wheatley said . Beth picked up two cans ; they felt metallic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Wheatley and got herself a clean glass from the bathroom . When Beth gave her the glass , Mrs. Wheatley said , " I guess you 've never had a beer before . " " I 'm sixteen . " " Well . . . " Mrs. Wheatley frowned . She lifted the tab with a little pop and poured expertly into Beth 's glass until the white collar stood above the rim . " Here , " she said , as though offering medicine . Beth sipped the beer . She had never had it before but it tasted much as she had expected , as though she had always known what beer would taste like . She tried not to make a face and finished almost half the glass . Mrs. Wheatley reached out from the bed and poured the rest of it in . Beth drank another mouthful . It stung her throat slightly , but then she felt a sensation of warmth in her stom-  | ach . Her face was flushed  --  as though she were blushing . She finished off the glassful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drink so fast . " " I 'd like another , " Beth said . She was thinking of Townes , how he had looked after they finished playing and she stood up to leave . He had smiled and taken her hand . Just holding his hand for that short time made her cheeks feel the way the beer had . She had won seven fast games from him . She held her glass tightly and for a moment wanted to throw it on the floor as hard as she could and watch it shatter . Instead she walked over , picked up another can of beer , put her finger in the ring and opened it . " You really should n't . . . " Mrs. Wheatley said . Beth filled her glass . " Well , " Mrs. Wheatley said , resigned , " if you 're going to do that , let me have one too . I just do n't want you to be sick ... " Beth banged her shoulder against the door frame going into the bathroom and barely got to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she threw up . After she finished , she stood by the toilet for a while and began to cry . Yet , even while she was crying , she knew that she had made a discovery with the three cans of beer , a discovery as important as the one she had made when she was eight years old and saved up her green pills and then took them all at one time . With the pills there was a long wait before the swooning came into her stomach and loosened the tightness . The beer gave her the same feeling with almost no wait . " No more beer , honey , " Mrs. Wheatley said when Beth came back into the bedroom . " Not until you 're eighteen . " The ballroom was set up for seventy chess players , and Beth 's first game was at Board Nine , against a small man from Oklahoma . She beat him as if in a dream , in two dozen moves . That afternoon , at Board Four , she crushed the defenses of a serious young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificing the bishop the way Paul Morphy had done . Benny Watts was in his twenties , but he looked nearly as young as Beth . He was not much taller , either . Beth saw him from time to time during the tournament . He started at Board One and stayed there ; people said he was the best American player since Morphy . Beth stood near him once at the Coke machine , but they did not speak . He was talking to another male player and smiling a lot ; they were amiably debating the virtues of the Semi-Slav defense . Beth had made a study of the Semi-Slav a few days before , and she had a euocl deal to sav about it , but she remained silent , got her Coke and  | walked away . Listening to the two of them , she had felt something unpleasant and familiar : the sense that chess was a thing between men , and she was an outsider . She hated the feeling . Watts was wearing a white shirt open at the collar , with the sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With his flat straw-colored hair he looked as American as Huckleberry Finn , yet there was something untrustworthy about his eyes . He , too , had been a child prodigy and that , besides the fact that he was Champion , made Beth uneasy . She remembered a Watts game book with a draw against Borstmann and a caption reading " Copenhagen : 1948 . " That meant Benny had been eight years old  --  the age Beth was when she was playing Mr. Shaibel in the basement . In the middle of that book was a photograph of him at thirteen , standing solemnly at a long table facing a group of uniformed midshipmen seated at chessboards ; he had played against the twenty-three-man team at Annapolis without losing a game . When she came back with her empty Coke bottle , he was still standing by the machine . He looked at her . " Hey , " he said pleasantly , " you 're Beth Harmon . " She put the bottle in the case . " Yes . " " I saw the piece in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed was a pretty one . " It was the game she 'd won against Beltik . " Thanks , " she said . " I 'm Benny Watts . " " I know . " " You should n't have castled , though , " he said smiling . She stared at him . " I needed to get the rook out . " " You could have lost your king pawn . " She was n't sure what he was talking about . She remembered the game well and had gone over it in her head a few times but found nothing wrong with it . Was it possible he had memorized the moves from Life and found a weakness ? Or was he just showing off ? Standing there , she pictured the position after the castle ; the king pawn looked all right to her . " I do n't think so . " " He plays bishop to B-5 , and you 've got to break the pin . " " Wait a minute , " she said . " I ca n't , " Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Set it up and think it out . Your problem is his queen knight . " Suddenly she was angry . " I do n't have to set it up to think it out . " " Goodness ! " he said and left . When he was gone , she stood by the Coke machine for several  | minutes going over the game , and then she saw it . There was an empty tournament board on a table near her ; she set up the position before castling against Beltik , just to be certain , but she felt a knot in her stomach doing it . Beltik could have made the pin , and then his queen knight became a threat . She had to break the pin and then protect against a fork with that damned knight , and after that he had a rook threat and , bingo , there went her pawn . It could have been crucial . But what was worse , she had n't seen it . And Benny Watts , just reading Life magazine , reading about a player he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing at the board ; she bit her lip , reached down and toppled the king . She had been so proud of finding an error in a Morphy game when she was in seventh grade . Now she 'd had something like that done to her , and she did not like it . Not at all . She was sitting behind the white pieces at Board One when Watts came in . When he shook her hand , he said in a low voice , " Knight to knight five . Right ? " " Yes , " she said , between her teeth . A flash bulb popped . Beth pushed her queen 's pawn to queen four . She played the Queen 's Gambit against him and by midgame felt with dismay that it had been a mistake . The Queen 's Gambit could lead to complicated positions , and this one was Byzantine . There were half a dozen threats on each side , and the thing that made her nervous , that made her reach out for a piece several times and then stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she did n't trust herself . She did not trust herself to see everything Benny Watts could see . He played with a calm , pleasant precision , picking up his pieces lightly and setting them down noiselessly , sometimes smiling to himself as he did so . Every move he made looked solid as a rock . Beth 's great strength was in fast attack , and she could find no way to attack . By the sixteenth move she was furious with herself for playing the gambit in the first place . There must have been forty people clustered around the especially large wooden table . There was a brown velvet curtain behind them with the names HARMON and WATTS pinned to it . The horrible feeling , at the bottom of the anger and fear , was that she was the weaker player  --  that Benny Watts knew more about chess than she did and could play it better . It was a new feeling for her , and it seemed to bind and restrict her as she had not been bound and restricted since the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a iuonrent she looked over the crowd around the table , trying to find Mrs. Wheatley , but she was not there . Beth turned back to the  | board and looked briefly at Benny . He smiled at her serenely , as though he were offering her a drink rather than a head-splitting chess position . Beth set her elbows on the table , leaned her cheeks against her clenched fists and began to concentrate . After a moment a simple thought came to her : I 'm not playing Benny Watts ; I 'm playing chess . She looked at him again . His eyes were studying the board now . He ca n't move until I do . He can only move one piece at a time . She looked back to the board and began to consider the effects of trading , to picture where the pawns would be if the pieces that clogged the center were exchanged . If she took his king knight with her bishop and he retook with the queen pawn .. . No good . She could advance the knight and force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to relax , forming and reforming the relationships of pawns in her mind , searching for a way of forcing an advantage . There was nothing in front of her now but the sixty-four squares and the shifting architecture of pawns  --  a jagged skyline of imaginary pawns , black and white , that flowed and shifted as she tried variation after variation , branch after branch of the game tree that grew from each set of moves . One branch began to look better than the others . She followed it for several half-moves to the possibilities that grew from it , holding in her mind the whole set of imaginary positions until she found one that had what she wanted to find . She sighed and sat upright . When she pulled her face away from her fists , her cheeks were sore and her shoulders stiff . She looked at her clock . Forty minutes had passed . Watts was yawning . She reached out and made the move , advancing a knight in a way that would force the first trade . It looked innocuous enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board for half a minute and started the trade . For a moment she felt panic in her stomach : Could he see what she was planning ? That quickly ? She tried to shake off the idea and took the offered piece . He took another , just as she had planned . She took . Watts reached out to take again , but hesitated . Do it ! she commanded silently . But he pulled his hand back . If he saw through what she was planning , there was still time to get out of it . She bit her lip . He was studying the board intently . He would see it . The ticking of the clock seemed very loud . Beth 's heart was beating so st rongly that for a moment she feared Watts would hear it and know she was panicked and But he did n't . he took the trade just as she had planned it . She looked at his face almost in disbelief . It was too late for him now . He uressed the button that stouucd his clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rook five . Immediately he stiffened in his chair  --  almost imperceptibly , but Beth saw it . He began studying the position intently . But he must have seen he was going to be stuck with doubled pawns ; after two or three minutes he shrugged and made the necessary move , and Beth did her continuation , and then on the next move the pawn was doubled and the nervousness and anger had left her . She was out to win now . She would hammer at his weakness . She loved it . She loved attack . Benny looked at her impassively for a moment . Then he reached out his hand , picked up his queen , and did something astonishing . He quietly captured her center pawn . Her protected pawn . The pawn that had been holding the queen to her corner for most of the game . He was sacrificing his queen . She could not believe it . And then she saw what it meant , and her stomach twisted sharply . How had she missed it ? With the pawn gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bishop on the opened diagonal . She could protect by retreating her knight and moving one of her rooks over , but the protection would n't last , because  --  she saw now with horror  --  his innocent-looking knight would block her king 's escape . It was terrible . It was the kind of thing she did to other people . It was the kind of thing Paul Morphy had done . And she had been thinking about doubled pawns . She did n't have to take the queen . What would happen if she did n't ? She would lose the pawn he had just taken . His queen would sit there in the center of the board . Worse , it could come over to her king rook file and press down on her castled king . The more she looked , the worse it became . And it had caught her completely offguard . She put her elbows on the table and stared at the position . She needed a counterthreat , a move that would stop him in his tracks . There was n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that Benny 's move was even sounder than she had thought . Maybe she could trade her way out of it if he attacked too quickly . She found a rook move and made it . If he would just bring the queen over now , there would be a chance to trade . He did n't . He developed his other bishop . She brought the rook up to the second rank . Then he swung the queen over , threatening mate in three . She had to respond by retreating her knight into the corner . He kept attacking , and with impotent dismay , she saw a lost game gradually become manifest . When he took her king bishop pawn with his bishop . sacrificing it , it was over , and she knew it was  | over . There was nothing to do . She wanted to scream , but instead set her king on its side and got up from the table . Her legs and back were stiff and painful . Her stomach was knotted . All she had really needed was a draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Benny had drawn twice already in the tournament . She had gone into the game with a perfect score , and a draw would have given her the title . But she had gone for a win . " Tough game , " Benny was saying . He was holding out his hand . She forced herself to take it . People were applauding . Not applauding her but Benny Watts . By evening she could still feel it , but it had lessened . Mrs. Wheatley tried to console her . The prize money would be split . She and Benny would be co-champions , each with a small trophy . " It happens all the time , " Mrs. Wheatley said . " I have made inquiries , and the Open Championship is often shared . " " I did n't see what he was doing , " Beth said , picturing the move where his queen took her pawn . It was like putting your tongue against an aching tooth . " You ca n't finesse everything , dear , " Mrs. Wheatley said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't know anything about chess , " she said . " I know what it feels like to lose . " " I bet you do , " Beth said , as viciously as she could . " I just bet you do . " Mrs. Wheatley peered at her meditatively for a moment . " And now you do too , " she said softly . Sometimes on the street that winter in Lexington people would look back over their shoulders at her . She was on the Morning Show on WLEX . The interviewer , a woman with heavily lacquered hair and harlequin glasses , asked Beth if she played bridge ; Beth said no . Did she like being the U.S. Open Champion at chess ? Beth said she was co-champion . Beth sat in a director 's chair with bright lights shining on her face . She was willing to talk about chess , but the woman 's manner , her false appearance of interest , made it difficult . Finally she was asked how she felt about the idea that chess was a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other chair and said , " No more than basketball . " But before she could go on about that , the show was over . She had been on for six minutes . The one-page article Townes had written about her appeared in thr Sttnthiv sunnlenirnt of thr 11 .. , . l.t I j : . t .... r.t .  | he had taken at the window of his room in Las Vegas . She liked herself in the picture , with her right hand on the white queen and her face looking clear , serious and intelligent . Mrs. Wheatley bought five copies of the paper for her scrapbook . Beth was in high school now , and there was a chess club , but she did not belong . The boys in it were nonplused to have a Master walking the hallways , and they would stare at her in a kind of embarrassed awe when she passed . Once a boy from twelfth grade stopped her to ask nervously if she would give a simultaneous in Chess Club sometime . She would play about thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near Methuen , and the way she was stared at afterward . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " I do n't have time . " The boy was unattractive and creepy-looking ; it made her feel unattractive and creepy just to be talking with him . She spent about an hour a night on her homework and made As . But homework meant nothing to her . It was the five or six hours of studying chess that was at the center of her life . She was enrolled as a special student at the university for a class in Russian that met one night a week . It was the only schoolwork that she paid serious attention to .  | BETH PUFFED , INHALED AND HELD THE SMOKE IN . THERE WAS NOTHing to it . She handed the joint to the young man on her right , and he said , " Thank you . " He had been talking about Donald Duck with Eileen . They were in Eileen and Barbara 's apartment , a block off Main Street . It was Eileen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night class . " It 's got to be Mel Blanc , " Eileen was saying now . " They 're all Mel Blanc . " Beth was still holding the smoke in , hoping that it would loosen her up . She had been sitting on the floor with these college students for half an hour and had said nothing . " Blanc does Sylvester , but he does n't do Donald Duck , " the young man said with finality . He turned around to face Beth . " I 'm Tim , " he said . " You 're the chess player . " Beth let the smoke out . " That 's right . " " You 're the U.S. Women 's Champion . " " I 'm the U.S. Open Co-Champion , " Beth said . " Sorry . It must be a trip . " He was red-haired and thin . She had seen him sitting in the middle of the classroom and could remember his soft voice when they recited Russian phrases in unison . " I ) o you play ? " Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt out of place . She should either go home or call Mrs. Wheatley .  | He shook his head . " Too cerebral . You want a beer ? " She had n't had a beer since Las Vegas , a year before . " Okay , " she said . She started to get up from the floor . " I 'll get it . " He pushed himself up from where they were sitting on the carpet . He came back with two cans and handed her one . She took a long drink . During the first hour the music had been so loud that conversation was impossible , but when the last record ended no one replaced it . The disk on the hi-fi against the far wall was still turning , and she could see the little red lights on the amplifier . She hoped no one would notice and play another record . Tim eased himself back down next to her with a sigh . " I used to play Monopoly a lot . " " I 've never played that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream about big bucks . " Beth laughed . The joint had come back her way , and she held it between her fingertips and got what she could from it before passing it to Tim . " Why are you taking Russian , " she said , " if you 're a slave of capitalism ? " She took another swallow of beer . " You 've got nice boobs , " he said and took a drag . " We need another joint , " he announced to the group at large . He turned back to Beth . " I wanted to read Dostoevsky in the original . " She finished her beer . Somebody produced another joint and began sending it around . There were a dozen people in the room . They 'd had their first exam in the evening class , and Beth had been invited to the party afterward . With the beer and marijuana and talking to Tim , who seemed very easy to talk to , she felt better . When the joint came up again , she took a long drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record . The music sounded much better , and the loudness did n't bother her now . Suddenly she stood up . " I ought to call home , " she said . " In the bedroom , through the kitchen . " In the kitchen she opened another beer . She took a long swallow , pushed open the bedroom door and felt for a light switch . She could not find it . A box of wooden matches sat on the stove by the frying pan , and she took it into the bedroom . She still could not find a switch , but on the dresser was a collection of candles in different shapes . She lit one and shook out the match . She stared for a moment at the candle . It was a lavender upright wax penis with a pair of ' glossy testicles at its base . The wick came from t he glans , and most of the glans had already melted away . Something in her was shocked .  | The telephone was on a table by the unmade bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the bed , and dialed . Mrs. Wheatley was a bit confused at first ; she was dazed from either TV or beer . " You go on to bed , " Beth said . " I 've got a key . " " Did you say you were partying with college students ? " Mrs. Wheatley said . " From the university ? " " Yes . " " Well , be careful what you smoke , honey . " There was a marvelous feeling across Beth 's shoulders and on the back of her neck . For a moment she wanted to rush home and embrace Mrs. Wheatley and hold her tight . But all she said was , " Okay . " " See you in the morning , " Mrs. Wheatley said . Beth sat on the edge of the bed , listening to the music from the living room , and finished her beer . She hardly ever listened to music and had never been to a school dance . If you did n't count the Apple Pi 's , this was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room the song ended . A moment later , Tim sat on the bed beside her . It seemed perfectly natural , like the response to a request she had made . " Have another beer , " he said . She took it and drank . Her movements felt slow and certain . " Jesus ! " Tim whispered in mock alarm . " What 's that purple thing burning there ? " " You tell me , " Beth said . She panicked for a moment as he pushed himself into her . It seemed frighteningly big , and she felt helpless , as if she were in a dentist 's chair . But that did n't last . He was careful , and it did n't hurt badly . She put her arms around his back , feeling the roughness of his bulky sweater . He began moving . He began to squeeze her breasts under her blouse . " Do n't do that , " she said , and he said , " Whatever you say , " and kept moving in and out . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . She was seventeen , and it was about time . He was wearing a condom . The best part had been watching him put it on , joking about it . What they were doing was really all right and nothing like books or movies . Fucking . Well , now . If only he were Townes . Afterward she fell asleep on the bed . Not in a lovers ' embrace , not even touching the man she had just made love with , but sprawled out on the bed with her clothes on . She saw Tim blow out the candle and heard the door close quietly after him . When she awoke . ahr xaw by the r Ir  --  rtrir : darn , eltteIk chat tt  | nearly ten in the morning . Sunlight came around the edges of the bedroom window blinds . The air smelled stale . Her legs were prickly from her wool skirt , and the neck of her sweater had been pressed against her throat , which felt sweaty . She was ferociously hungry . She sat on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and pushed open the kitchen door . Empty bottles and beer cans were everywhere . The air was foul with dead smoke . A note was fastened to the refrigerator door with a magnet in the shape of Mickey Mouse 's head . It read : " Everybody went to Cincinnati to see a movie . Stay as long as you like . " The bathroom was off the living room . When she had finished showering and had dried herself , she wrapped a towel around her hair , went back to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator . There were eggs in a carton , two cans of Budweiser and some pickles . On the door shelf was a Baggie . She picked it up . Inside was a single , tightly rolled joint . She took it out , put it in her mouth and lit it with a wooden match . She inhaled deeply . Then she took out four eggs and put them on to boil . She had never felt so hungry in her life . She cleaned up the apartment in an organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four large grocery bags to put all the bottles and butts in and stacking these on the back porch . She found a half-full bottle of Ripple and four unopened beer cans in the debris . She opened a beer and began vacuuming the living-room carpet . Hanging over a chair in the bedroom was a pair of jeans . When she had finished cleaning she changed into them . They fit her perfectly . She found a white T-shirt in a drawer and put it on . Then she drank the rest of her beer and opened another . Someone had left a lipstick on the back of the toilet . She went to the bathroom and studying herself in the mirror , reddened her lips carefully . She had never worn lipstick before . She was beginning to feel very good . Mrs. Wheatley 's voice sounded faint and anxious . " You might have called . " " I 'm sorry , " Beth said . " I did n't want to wake you up . " " I would n't have minded ... " " Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati to see a movie . I wo n't be home tonight either . " There was a silence at the other end of the line . " I 'll be back after school Monday . " Finally MIN . Wheatley spoke . " Are you with a boy ? "  | " I was last night . " " Oh . " Mrs. Wheatley 's voice sounded distant . " Beth ... " Beth laughed . " Come on , " she said . " I 'm all right . " " Well . . . " She still sounded grave , then her voice became lighter . " I suppose it 's all right . It 's just that ? " Beth smiled . " I wo n't get pregnant , " she said . At noon she put the rest of the eggs in a pot to boil and turned on the hi-fi . She had never really listened to music before , but she listened now . She danced a few steps in the middle of the living room , waiting for the eggs . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drink one beer  --  or one glass of wine  --  every hour . She had made love the night before , and now it was time to learn about being drunk . She was alone , and she liked it . It was the way she had learned everything important in her life . At four in the afternoon she walked into Larry 's Package Store , a block from the apartment , and bought a fifth of Ripple . When the man was putting it in the bag , she said , " Do you have a wine like Ripple that 's not so sweet ? " " These soda-pop wines are all the same , " the man said . " What about burgundy ? " Sometimes Mrs. Wheatley ordered burgundy with her dinner when they ate out . " I 've got Gallo , Italian Swiss Colony , Paul Masson ... " " Paul Masson , " Beth said . " Two bottles . " That night at eleven she was able to get undressed by being careful . She had found a pair of pajamas earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her clothes on a chair before getting into bed and passing out . No one had come back by morning . She made scrambled eggs and ate them with two pieces of toast before having her first glass of wine . It was another sunny day . In the living room she found Vivaldi 's " The Four Seasons . " She put it on . Then she began drinking in earnest . On Monday morning Beth took a taxi to Henry Clay High School and arrived ten minutes before her first class . She had left the apartment empty and clean ; the owners had not yet returned from Cincinnati . Most of the wrinkles had hung out of her sweater and skirt , and she had washed her argyle socks . She had drunk the second bottle of'burgundy Sunday night and slept soundly for ten hours . Now , in the taxi , there was a dint ache at the back of her head and her hands trembled slightly , but outside the window the May morning was exuuisitr , and the screen of the young leaves on trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she paid and got out she felt light and springy , ready to go ahead and finish high school and devote her energy to chess . She had three thousand dollars in her savings account ; she was no longer a virgin ; and she knew how to drink . There was an embarrassed silence when she came home after school . Mrs. Wheatley , wearing a blue housedress , was mopping the kitchen floor . Beth settled herself on the sofa and picked up Reuben Fine 's book on the endgame . It was a book she hated . She had seen a can of Pabst on the side of the sink , but she did not want any . It would be better not to drink anything for a long while . She had had enough . When Mrs. Wheatley finished , she set the mop against the refrigerator and came into the living room . " I see you 're back , " she began . Her voice was carefully neutral . Beth looked at her . " I had a good time , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she allowed herself a small smile . It was surprisingly shy , like a girl 's smile . " Well , " she said , " chess is n't the only thing in life . " Beth graduated from high school in June , and Mrs. Wheatley gave her a Bulova watch . The back of the case read " With love from Mother . " She liked that , but what she liked better was the rating that came in the mail : 2243 . At the school party , several other graduates offered Beth surreptitious drinks , but she refused . She had fruit punch and went home early . She needed to study ; she would be playing her first international tournament , in Mexico City , in two weeks , and after that came the United States Championship . She had been invited to the Remy-Vallon in Paris , at the end of the summer . Things were beginning to happen . Chapter Eight ' a ' t ' a  | AN HOUR AFTER THE PLANE CROSSED THE BORDER ; BETH WAS ABsorbed in pawn-structure analysis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Beth , " Mrs. Wheatley said , " I have a confession to make . " Beth put the book down , reluctantly . Mrs. Wheatley seemed nervous . " Do you know what a pen pal is , dear ? " " Someone you trade letters with . " " Exactly ! When I was in high school , our Spanish class was given a list of boys in Mexico who were studying English . I picked one and sent him a letter about myself . " Mrs. Wheatley gave a little laugh . " His name was Manuel . We corresponded for a long time  --  even while I was married to Allston . We exchanged photographs . " Mrs. Wheatley opened her purse , rummaged through it and produced a bent snapshot which she handed to Beth . It was a picture of a thinlaced man , surprisingly pale-looking , with a pencil-thin mustache . Mrs. Wheatley hesitated and said , " Manuel will be meeting us at the airport . " Beth had no objection to this ; it might even be a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by Mrs. Wheatley 's manner . " Have you met him before ' ? "  | " Never . " She leaned over in her seat and squeezed Beth 's forearm . " You know , I 'm really quite thrilled . " Beth could see that she was a little drunk . " Is that why you wanted to come down early ? " Mrs. Wheatley pulled back and straightened the sleeves of her blue cardigan . " I suppose so , " she said . " Si como no ? " Mrs. Wheatley said . " And he dresses so well , and opens doors for me and orders dinner beautifully . " She was pulling up her pantyhose as she talked , tugging fiercely to get them over her broad hips . They were probably fucking  --  Mrs. Wheatley and Manuel Cordoba y Serano . Beth did not let herself visualize it . Mrs. Wheatley had come back to the hotel at about three that morning , and at two-thirty the night before . Beth , pretending to be asleep , had smelled the ripe mix of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undressing and sighing . " I thought at first it was the altitude , " Mrs. Wheatley said . " Seven thousand three hundred and fifty feet . " Sitting down at the little brass vanity bench , she leaned forward on one elbow and began rouging her cheeks . " It makes a person positively giddy . But I think now it 's the culture . " She stopped and turned to Beth . " There is no hint of a Protestant ethic in Mexico . They are all Latin Catholics , and they all live in the here and now . " Mrs. Wheatley had been reading Alan Watts . " I think I 'll have just one margarita before I go out . Would you call for one , honey ? " Back in Lexington , Mrs. Wheatley 's voice would sometimes have a distance to it , as though she were speaking from some lonely reach of an interior childhood . Here in Mexico City the voice was distant but the tone was theatrically gay , as though Alma Wheatley were savoring an incommunicable private mirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to say something about the expensiveness of room service , even measured in pesos , but she did n't . She picked up the phone and dialed six . The man answered in English . She told him to send a margarita and a large Coke to 713 . " You could come to the Folklorico , " Mrs. Wheatley said , " I understand the costumes alone are worth the price of admission . " " The tournament starts tomorrow . I need to work on endgames . " Mrs. Wheatley was sitting on the edge of the bed , admiring her feet . " Beth , honey , " she said dreamily , " perhaps you need to work on your. +rl/ . Chess certainly is n't all there is. "  | " It 's what I know . " Mrs. Wheatley gave a long sigh . " My experience has taught me that what you know is n't always important . " " What is important ? " " Living and growing , " Mrs. Wheatley said with finality . " Living your life . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she kept silent . She did not like the jealousy she felt . " Beth , " Mrs. Wheatley went on in a voice rich with plausibility . " You have n't visited Bellas Artes or even Chapultepec Park . The zoo there is delightful . You 've taken your meals in this room and spent your time with your nose in chess books . Should n't you just relax on the day before the tournament and think about something other than chess ? " Beth wanted to hit her . If she had gone to those places , she would have had to go with Manuel and listen to his endless stories . He was forever touching Mrs. Wheatley 's shoulder or her back , standing too close to her , smiling too eagerly . " Mother , " she said , " tomorrow at ten I play the black pieces against Octavio Marenco , the champion of Brazil . That means he has the first move . He is thirty-four years old and an International Grandmaster . If I lose , we will be paying for this trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win , I will be playing someone in the afternoon who is even better than Marenco . I need to work on my endgames . " " Honey , you are what is called an intuitive ' player , are n't you ? " Mrs. Wheatley had never discussed chess playing with her before . " I 've been called that . Moves come to me sometimes . " " I 've noticed the moves they applaud the loudest are the ones you make quickly . And there 's a certain look on your face . " Beth was startled . " I suppose you 're right , " she said . " Intuition does n't come from books . I think it 's because you do n't like Manuel . " " Manuel 's all right , " Beth said , " but he does n't come by to see me . " That 's irrelevant , " Mrs. Wheatley said . " You need to relax . ( ' here 's not another player in the world as gifted as you are . I have n't the remotest idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , but I am convinced that relaxation can only improve them . " Beth said nothing . She had been furious for several days . She did not like Mexico City or this enormous concrete hotel with its  | cracked tiles and leaky faucets . She did not like the food in the hotel , but she did not want to eat alone in restaurants . Mrs. Wheatley had gone out for lunch and dinner every day with Manuel , who owned a green Dodge and seemed to be always at her disposal . " Why do n't you have lunch with us ? " Mrs. Wheatley said . " We can drop you off afterward and you can study then . " Beth started to answer , when there was a knock at the door . It was room service with Mrs. Wheatley 's margarita . Beth signed for it while Mrs. Wheatley took a few thoughtful sips and stared out the window at the sunlight . " I really have n't been well lately , " Mrs. Wheatley said , squinting . Beth looked at her coolly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass by the stem in one hand while her other hand fluttered at her thick waist . There was something deeply pathetic about her , and Beth 's heart softened . " I do n't want lunch , " Beth said , " but you can drop me off at the zoo . I 'll take a cab back . " Mrs. Wheatley hardly seemed to hear , but after a moment she turned to Beth , still holding the glass in the same way , and smiled vaguely . " That 'll be nice , dear , " she said . Beth spent a long time looking at the Galapagos turtles  --  big , lumbering creatures in permanent slow motion . One of the keepers had dumped a bushel of wet-looking lettuce and overripe tomatoes into their pen and the five of them pushed through the pile as a group , munching and trampling , their feet like the dusty feet of elephants and their stupid innocent faces intent on something beyond vision or food . While she was standing by the fence a vendor came by with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Cerveza Corona , por favor , " and held out a five-peso note . The man flipped off the bottle top and poured the drink into a paper cup with an Aztec Eagle logo . " Muchisimas gracias , " she said . It was her first beer since high school ; in the hot Mexican sun , it tasted wonderful . She drank it quickly . A few minutes later she saw another vendor standing by a circle of red flowers ; she bought another beer . She knew she should not be doing this ; the tournament started tomorrow . She did not need liquor . Nor tranquilizers . She had not had a green pill for several months now . But she drank the beer . It was three in the afternoon , and the sun was ferocious . The zoo was full of women , most of them in dark rebozos , with small dark-eyed children . What few men there were gave Beth significant looks , but she ignored them , and none of them tried to speak to her . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quiet place , and the crowd seemed more like the crowd at a museum . There were flowers everywhere . She finished her beer , bought another and continued walking . She was beginning to feel high . She passed more trees , more flowers , cages with sleeping chimpanzees . Around a corner she came face to face with a family of gorillas . Inside the cage the huge male and the baby were asleep head to head with their black bodies pressed against the bars in front . In the middle of the cage the female leaned philosophically against an enormous truck tire , scowling and biting a fingertip . Standing on the asphalt outside the cage was a human family , also a mother , father and child , watching the gorillas attentively . They were not Mexicans . It was the man who caught Beth 's attention . She recognized his face . He was a short , heavy man , not unlike a gorilla himself , with jutting brow ridges , bushy eyebrows , coarse black hair and an impassive look . Beth stiffened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks flushing . The man was Vasily Borgov , Chess Champion of the World . There was no mistaking the grim Russian face , the authoritarian scowl . She had seen it on the cover of Chess Review several times , once with the same black suit and splashy green-and-gold tie . Beth stared for a full minute . She had not known Borgov would be at this tournament . She had already received her board assignment by mail : it was Board Nine . Borgov would be Board One . She felt a sudden chill at the back of her neck and looked down at the beer in her hand . She raised it to her mouth and finished it , resolving it would be her last until after the tournament . Looking at the Russian again , she panicked ; would he recognize her ? He must not see her drinking . He was looking into the cage as though waiting for the gorilla to move a pawn . The gorilla was clearly lost in her own thoughts , ignoring everyone . Beth envied her . Beth had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was awakened by Mrs. Wheatley 's arrival , sometime in the middle of the night . Mrs. Wheatley coughed a good deal while she was undressing in the darkened room . " Go ahead and turn the light on , " Beth said . " I 'm awake . " " I 'm sorry , " Mrs. Wheatley gasped between coughs . " I seem to have a virus . " She turned the bathroom light on and partially closed t lie door . Beth looked at the little Japanese clock on the nightstand . It was ten after four . The sounds she made undressing  --  the rustling and partly suppressed coughing  --  were infuriating . Beth 's first chess gam e ? would begin in six hours . She lay in bed furious and tense , waiting lint Mrs. Wheatley to be quiet .  | Marenco was a somber little dark-skinned man in a dazzling canary-colored shirt . He spoke almost no English and Beth no Portuguese ; they began playing without preliminary conversation . Beth did not feel like talking , anyway . Her eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had felt generally unpleasant from the time their plane landed in Mexico , as though she were on the verge of developing an illness that she never quite got , and she had not gone back to sleep the night before . Mrs. Wheatley had coughed in her sleep and muttered and rasped , while Beth tried to force herself to relax , to ignore the distractions . She did not have any green pills with her . There were three left , but they were in Kentucky . She lay on her back with her arms straight at her sides as she had as an eight-year-old trying to sleep by the hallway door at Methuen . Now , sitting on a straight wooden chair in front of a long tableful of chessboards in the ballroom of a Mexican hotel , she felt irritated and a bit dizzy . Marenco had just opened with pawn to king four . Her clock was ticking . She shrugged and played pawn to queen 's bishop four , trusting the formal maneuvers of the Sicilian to keep her steady until she got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with civil orthodoxy . She pushed the queen pawn to the fourth rank ; he exchanged pawns . She began to relax as her mind moved away from her body and onto the tableau of forces in front of her . By eleven-thirty she had him down by two pawns , and just after noon he resigned . They had got nowhere close to an endgame ; when Marenco stood up and offered her his hand , the board was still massed with uncaptured pieces . The top three boards were in a separate room across the hallway from the main ballroom . Beth had glanced at it that morning while rushing , five minutes late , to the place where she was to play , but she had not stopped to look in . She walked toward it now , across the carpeted room with its rows of players bent over boards  --  players from the Philippines and West Germany and Iceland and Norway and Chile , most of them young , almost all of them male . There were two other women : a Mexican official 's niece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Aires ; she was at Board Seventeen . Beth did not stop to look at any of the positions . Several people were standing in the hallway outside the smaller game room . She pushed past them into the doorway , and t here across the room from her at Board One , wearing the same dark suit ,  | the same grim scowl , was Vasily Borgov , his expressionless eyes on the game in front of him . A respectfully silent crowd stood between her and him , but the players sat on a kind of wooden stage a few feet above floor level , and she could see him clearly . Behind him on the wall was a display chessboard with cardboard pieces ; a Mexican was just moving one of the white knights into its new position as Beth came in . She studied the board for a moment . Everything was very tight , but Borgov seemed to have an edge . She looked at Borgov and quickly looked away . His face was alarming in its concentration . She turned and left , walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but awake . She blinked at Beth from the bed , pulling the covers up to her chin . " Hi , sweetie . " " I thought we could have lunch , " Beth said . " I do n't play again until tomorrow . " " Lunch , " Mrs. Wheatley said . " Oh my . " And then ; " How did you do ? " " He resigned after thirty moves . " " You 're a wonder , " Mrs. Wheatley said . She pushed herself carefully up in bed until she was sitting . " I 'm feeling wonky , but I probably need something in my stomach . Manuel and I had cabrito for dinner . It may yet be the end of me . " She looked very pale . She got out of bed slowly and walked to the bathroom . " I suppose I could have a sandwich , or one of those less inflamed tacos . " The competition at the tournament was more consistent , vigorous and professional than anything Beth had seen before , yet its effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game after a near-sleepless night , was not disturbing . It was a smoothly run affair , with all announcements made in both Spanish and English . Everything was hushed . In her game the next day she played the Queen 's Gambit Declined against an Austrian named Diedrich , a pale , esthetic young man in a sleeveless sweater , and she forced him to resign in nridgame with a relentless pressure in the center of the board . She ( lid it mostly with pawns and was herself quietly amazed at the intricacies that seemed to flow from her fingertips as she took the center of the board and began to crush his position as one might crush an egg . He had played well , made no blunders or anything that could properly he called a mistake , but Beth moved with such deadly accuracy , such measured control , that his position was hopeIcss by the twenty-thin ) move .  | Mrs. Wheatley had invited her to have dinner with her and Manuel ; Beth had refused . Although you did n't eat dinner in Mexico until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheatley in the room when she came back from shopping at seven . She was dressed but in bed with her head propped up against a pillow . A half-finished drink sat on the nightstand beside her . Mrs. Wheatley was in her mid-forties , but the paleness of her face and the lines of worry in her forehead made her look much older . " Hello , dear , " she said in a faint voice . " Are you sick ? " " A bit under the weather . " " I could get a doctor . " The word " doctor " seemed to hang in the air between them until Mrs. Wheatley said , " It 's not that bad . I just need rest . " Beth nodded and went into the bathroom to wash up . Mrs. Wheatley 's appearance and behavior were disturbing . But when Beth came back into the room , she was out of bed and looking lively enough , smoothing the covers . She smiled wryly . " Manuel wo n't be coming . " Beth looked inquiringly at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated for a moment . " How long will he be away ? " Mrs. Wheatley sighed . " At least until we leave . " " I 'm sorry . " " Well , " Mrs. Wheatley said , " I 've never been to Oaxaca , but I suspect it resembles Denver . " Beth stared at her a moment and then laughed . " We can have dinner together , " she said . " You can take me to one of the places you know about . " " Of course , " Mrs. Wheatley said . She smiled ruefully . " It was fun while it lasted . He really had a pleasant sense of humor . " " That 's good , " Beth said . " Mr. Wheatley did n't seem very amusing . " " My God , " Mrs. Wheatley said , " Allston never thought anything was funny , except maybe Eleanor Roosevelt . " In this tournament each player played one game a day . It would go on for six days . Beth 's first two games were simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock . She arrived five minutes early and was at the board when her opponent came walking up , a bit awkwardly . He looked about twelve  | years old . Beth had seen him around the ballroom , had passea boards where he was playing , but she had been distracted , and his youth had n't really registered . He had curly black hair and wore an old-fashioned white sport shirt , so neatly ironed that its creases stood out from his thin arms . It was very strange , and she felt uncomfortable . She was supposed to be the prodigy . He looked so damned serious . She held out her hand . " I 'm Beth Harmon . " He stood , bowed slightly , took her hand firmly and shook it once . " I am Georgi Petrovitch Girev , " he said . Then he smiled shyly , a small furtive smile . " I am honored . " She felt flustered . " Thanks . " They both sat , and he pressed the button down on her clock . She played pawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this unnerving child . It started out as a routine Queen 's Gambit Accepted ; he took the offered bishop pawn , and they both developed toward the center . But as they got into the midgame it became more complex than usual , and she realized that he was playing a very sophisticated defense . He moved fast  --  maddeningly fast  --  and he seemed to know exactly what he was going to do . She tried a few threats , but he was unperturbed by them . An hour passed , then another . The move numbers were now in the thirties , and the board was dense with men . She looked at him as he was moving a piece  --  at the skinny little arm stuck out from the absurd shirt  --  and she hated him . He could have been a machine . You little creep , she thought , suddenly realizing that the adults she had played as a child must have thought the same thing about her . It was afternoon now , and most of the games were finished . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with and get back to Mrs. Wheatley . She was worried about Mrs. Wheatley . She felt old and weary playing this tireless child with his bright dark eyes and quick little movements ; she knew that if she made even a small blunder , he would be at her throat . She looked at her clock . Twenty-five minutes left . She would have to speed up and get forty moves in before her flag dropped . If she did n't watch it , he would have her in serious time pressure . That was something she was in the habit of putting other people in ; it made her uneasy . She had never been behind on the clock before . For the last several moves she had been considering a series of trades in the center knight and bishop for knight and bishop , and a rook exchange a few moves later . It would simplify a good deal , but the problem wits that it mule for an endgame and she tried to  | avoid endgames . Now , seeing that she was forty-five minutes behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get rid of this log jam . She picked up her knight and took his king 's bishop with it . He responded immediately , not even looking up at her . He took her queen 's bishop . They continued with the moves as though they had been predetermined , and when it was over , the board was full of empty spaces . Each player had a rook , a knight , four pawns and the king . She brought her king out from the back rank , and so did he . At this stage the king 's power as an attacker became abruptly manifest ; it was no longer necessary to hide it . The question now was one of getting a pawn to the eighth rank and promoting it . They were in the endgame . She drew in her breath , shook her head to clear it and began to concentrate on the position . The important thing was to have a plan . " We should perhaps adjourn now . " It was Girev 's voice , almost a whisper . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then looked back at the clock . Both flags had fallen . That had never happened to her before . She was startled and sat stupidly in her chair for a moment . " You must seal the move , " Girev said . Suddenly he looked uncomfortable and held up his hand for the tournament director . One of the directors came over , walking softly . It was a middleaged man with thick glasses . " Miss Harmon must seal her move , " Girev said . The director looked at the clock . " I 'll get an envelope . " She looked at the board again . It seemed clear enough . She should advance the rook pawn that she had decided on already , putting it on the fourth rank . The director handed her an envelope and stepped discreetly back a few steps . Girev rose and turned away politely . Beth wrote " P-QR4 " on her score sheet , folded it , put it in the envelope and handed it to the tournament director . She stood up stiffly and looked around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few players were still there , some seated and some standing , looking over positions on the boards . A few were huddled over boards , analyzing games that had ended . Girev had come back to the table . His face was very serious . " May I ask something ? " he said . " Yes . " " In America , " he said , " I am told that one sees films in cars . Is this true ? " " Drive-ins ? " she said . " You mean drive-in movies ? "  | " Yes . Elvis Presley movies that you watch from inside a car . Debbie Reynolds and Elizabeth Taylor . That happens ? " " It sure does . " He looked at her , and suddenly his earnest face broke into a broad smile . " I would dig that , " he said . " I would certainly dig that . " Mrs. Wheatley slept soundly through the night and was still sleeping when Beth got up . Beth felt refreshed and alert ; she had gone to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt all right about it in the morning . The pawn move had been strong enough . She walked barefoot from the sofa where she had been sleeping to the bed where Mrs. Wheatley lay and felt her forehead . It was cool . Beth kissed her lightly on the cheek and went into the bathroom and showered . When she left for breakfast , Mrs. Wheatley was still asleep . Her morning game was with a Mexican in his early twenties . Beth had the black pieces , played the Sicilian and caught him off-guard on the nineteenth move . Then she began wearing him down . Her head was very clear , and she was able to keep him so busy trying to answer her threats that she was able eventually to pick off a bishop in exchange for two pawns and drive his king into an exposed position with a knight check . When she brought her queen out , the Mexican stood up , smiled at her coldly and said , " Enough . Enough . " He shook his head angrily . " I resign the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to finish , to drive his king across the board and checkmate it . " You play a game that is .. . awesome , " the Mexican said . " You make a man feel helpless . " He bowed slightly , turned and left the table . Playing out the Girev game that afternoon , she found herself moving with astonishing speed and force . Girev was wearing a light-blue shirt this time , and it stuck out from his elbows like the edges of a child 's kite . She sat at the board impatiently while the tournament director opened the envelope and made the pawn move she had sealed the day before . She got up and paced across the nearly empty ballroom where two other adjournments were being played out , waiting for Girev to move . She looked back across the room toward him several times and saw him hunched over the board , his little lists jammed into his pale checks , the blue shirt seeming to glow under the ? lights . She hated hint hated his seriousness and hated his vomit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the click of the clock button from halfway across the room and made a beeline back to the table . She did not take her seat but stood looking at the position . He had put his rook on the queen bishop file , as she had thought he might . She was ready for that and pushed her pawn again , turned and walked back across the room . There was a table there with a water pitcher and a few paper cups . She poured herself a cup , surprised to see that her hand trembled as she did so . By the time she got back to the board , Girev had moved again . She moved immediately , not bringing the rook to defend but abandoning the pawn and instead advancing her king . She picked the piece up lightly with her fingertips the way she had seen that piratical-looking man in Cincinnati do years before and dropped it on the queen four square , turned and walked away again . She kept it up that way , not sitting down at all . Within three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really simple  --  almost too easy . It was only a matter of trading rooks at the right time . The trade pulled his king back a square on the recapture , just enough to let her pawn get by and queen . But Girev did not wait for that ; he resigned immediately after the rook check and the trade which followed . He stepped toward her as if to say something , but seeing her face , stopped . For a moment she softened , remembering the child she had been only a few years before and how it devastated her to lose a chess game . She held out her hand , and when he shook it she forced a smile and said , " I 've never been to a drive-in either . " He shook his head . " I should not have let you do that . With the rook . " " Yes , " she said . And then : " How old were you when you started playing chess ? " " Four . I was district champion at seven . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When ? " " In three years . " " You 'll be sixteen in three years . " He nodded grimly . " If you win , what will you do afterward ? " He looked puzzled . " I do n't understand . " " If you 're World Champion at sixteen , what will you do with the rest of your life ? " I le still looked puzzled . " I do n't understand , " he said .  | Mrs. Wheatley went to bed early and seemed better the next morning . She was up before Beth , and when they went downstairs together for breakfast in the Camara de Toreros , Mrs. Wheatley ordered a Spanish omelet and two cups of coffee and finished it all . Beth felt relieved . On the bulletin board near the registration desk was a list of players ; Beth had not looked at it for several days . Coming into the room now ten . minutes before game time , she stopped and checked the scores . They were listed in order of their international ratings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeenth with 2370 . After each player 's name was a series of boxes showing his score for the rounds . " 0 " meant a loss , " ' /z " a draw , and " 1 " a win . There were a great many " ? ' s . " Three names had an uninterrupted string of " 1 's " after them ; Borgov and Harmon were two of these . The pairings were a few feet to the right . At the top of the list was BORGOV-RAND , and below that HARMON-SOLOMON . If she and Borgov both won today , they would not necessarily play each other in the final game tomorrow . She was not sure whether she wanted to play him or not . Playing Girev had rattled her . She felt a dim unsureness about Mrs. Wheatley , despite her apparent resurgence ; the image of her white skin , rouged cheeks and forced smiles made Beth uneasy . A buzz of voices had begun in the room as players found their boards , set up their clocks , settled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as she could and found Board Four  --  the first board in the big room  --  and waited for Solomon . Solomon was by no means easy , and the game lasted four hours before he was forced to resign . Yet at no point during all of that time did she ever lose her edge  --  the tiny advantage that the opening move gives to the player of the white pieces . Solomon did not say anything , but she could tell from the way he stalked off afterward that he was furious to be beaten by a woman . She had seen it often enough before to recognize it . Usually it made her angry , but it did n't matter right now . She had something else on her mind . When he had gone she went to look in the smaller room where Borgov played , but it was empty . The winning position  --  Borgov 's  --  was still displayed on the big board on the wall ; it was as devastating as Beth 's win over Solomon had been . In the ballroom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairings were already up . That was a surprise . She stepped  | closer to look , and her heart caught in her throat ; at the top of the finals list in black printed letters was BORGOV-HARMON . She blinked and read it again , holding her breath . Beth had brought three books with her to Mexico City . She and Mrs. Wheatley ate dinner in their room , and afterward Beth took out Grandmaster Games ; in it were five of Borgov 's . She opened it to the first one and began to play through it , using her board and pieces . She seldom did this , generally relying on her ability to visualize a game when going over it , but she wanted to have Borgov in front of her as palpably as possible . Mrs. Wheatley lay in bed reading while Beth played through the games , looking for weaknesses . She found none . She played through them again , stopping in certain positions where the possibilities seemed nearly infinite , and working them all out . She sat staring at the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the combinations played themselves out in her head . Every now and then a sound from Mrs. Wheatley or a tension in the air of the room brought her out of it for a moment , and she looked around dazedly , feeling the pained tightness of her muscles and the thin , intrusive edge of fear in her stomach . There had been a few times over the past year when she felt like this , with her mind not only dizzied but nearly terrified by the endlessness of chess . By midnight Mrs. Wheatley had put her book aside and gone quietly to sleep . Beth sat in the green armchair for hours , not hearing Mrs. Wheatley 's gentle snores , not sensing the strange smell of a Mexican hotel in her nostrils , feeling somehow that she might fall from a precipice , that sitting over the chessboard she had bought at Purcell 's in Kentucky , she was actually poised over an abyss , sustained there only by the bizarre mental equipment that had fitted her for this elegant and deadly game . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . She did not go to bed until after four and , asleep , she dreamed of drowning . A few people had gathered in the ballroom . She recognized Marenco , dressed in a suit and tie now ; he waved at her as she came in , and she forced herself to smile in his direction . It was frightening to see even this player she had already beaten . She was jumpy , knew she was jumpy , and did not know what to do about it . She had showered at seven that morning , unable to rid herself of the tension she had awakened with . She was barely able to get down her morning coffee in the near-empty coffee shop and had washed  | her face afterward , carefully , trying to focus herself . Now she crossed the ballroom 's red carpet and went to the ladies ' room and washed her face again . She dried carefully with paper towels and combed her hair , watching herself in the big mirror . Her movements seemed forced , and her body looked impossibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Her fear was as sharp as a toothache . As she came down the hallway , she saw him . He was standing there solidly with two men she did not recognize . All of them wore dark suits . They were close together , talking softly , confidentially . She lowered her eyes and walked past them into the small room . Some men were waiting there with cameras . Reporters . She slipped behind the black pieces at Board One . She stared at the board for a moment , heard the tournament director 's voice saying , " Play will begin in three minutes , " and looked up . Borgov was walking across the room toward her . His suit fit him well , with the trouser legs draping neatly above the tops of his shined black shoes . Beth turned her eyes back to the board , embarrassed , feeling awkward . Borgov had seated himself . She heard the director 's voice as if from a great distance , " You may start your opponent 's clock , " and she reached out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was sitting there solid , dark and heavy , looking fixedly at the board , and she watched as if in a dream as he reached out a stubby-fingered hand , picked up the king pawn and set it on the fourth rank . Pawn to king four . She stared at it for a moment . She always played the Sicilian to that opening  --  the most common opening for White in the game of chess . But she hesitated . Borgov had been called " Master of the Sicilian " somewhere in a journal . Almost impulsively she played pawn to king four herself , hoping to play him on ground that was fresh for both of them , that would not give him the advantage of superior knowledge . He brought out his king 's knight to bishop three , and she brought hers to queen bishop three , protecting the pawn . And t hen without hesitation he played his bishop to knight five and her heart sank . The Ruy Lopez . She had played it often enough , but in this game it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzed , as the Sicilian , and there were dozens of lines she hardly knew , except for memorizing them from books . Someone flashed another bulb for a picture and she heard the tournament director 's angry whisper not to disturb the players . She pushed her pawn up to rook three , attacking the bishop . Borgov pulled it back to rook four . She forced herself to concentrate , brought out her other knight , and Borgov castled . All this was famil-  | iar , but it was no relief . She now had to decide to play either the open variation or the closed . She glanced up at Borgov 's face and then back at the board . She took his pawn with her knight , starting the open . He played pawn to queen four , as she knew he would , and she played pawn to queen knight four because she had to , so she would be ready when he moved the rook . The chandelier overhead was too bright . And now she began to feel dismay , as though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were locked into some choreography of feints and counterthreats in which it was a fixed necessity that she lose , like a game from one of the books where you knew the outcome and played it only to see how it happened . She shook her head to clear it . The game had not gone that far . They were still playing out tired old moves and the only advantage White had was the advantage White always had  --  the first move . Someone had said that when computers really learned to play chess and played against one another , White would always win because of the first move . Like tick-tack-toe . But it had n't come to that . She was not playing a perfect machine . Borgov brought his bishop back to knight three , retreating . She played pawn to queen four , and he took the pawn and she brought her bishop to king three . She had known this much back at Methuen from the lines she memorized in class from Modern Chess Openings . But the game was ready now to enter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked up just as Borgov , his face smooth and impassive , picked up his queen and set it in front of the king , on king two . She blinked at it for a moment . What was he doing ? Going after the knight on her king five ? He could pin the pawn that protected the knight easily enough with a rook . But the move looked somehow suspicious . She felt the tightness in her stomach again , a touch of dizziness . She folded her arms across her chest and began to study the position . Out of the corner of her eye she could see the young man who moved the pieces on the display board placing the big cardboard white queen on the king two square . She glanced out into the room . There were about a dozen people standing there watching . She turned back to the board . She would have to get rid of his bishop . Knight to rook four looked good for that . There was also knight to bishop four or bishop to king two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment and discarded the idea . She did not trust herself against Borgov with those complications . ' I'o put a knight on the rook file cut its range in hall ; but she did it . She had to get rid of ' the bishop . The bishop was up to no good .  | Borgov reached down without hesitation and played knight to queen four . She stared at it ; she had expected him to move his rook . Still there seemed to be no harm in it . Pushing her queen bishop pawn up to the fourth square looked good . It would force Borgov 's knight to take her bishop , and after that she could take his bishop with her knight and stop the annoying pressure on her other knight , the one that sat a bit too far down the board on king five and did n't have enough flight squares for comfort . Against Borgov , the loss of a knight would be lethal . She played the queen bishop pawn , holding the piece for a moment between her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther back in her chair and drew a deep breath . The position looked good . Without hesitation Borgov took the bishop with his knight , and Beth retook with her pawn . Then he played his queen bishop pawn to the third rank , as she thought he might , creating a place for the nuisance bishop to hide . She took the bishop with relief , getting rid of it and getting her knight off the embarrassing rook file . Borgov remained impassive , taking the knight with his pawn . His eyes flicked up to hers and back to the position . She looked down nervously . It had looked good a few moves before ; it did not look so good now . The problem was her knight on king five . He could move his queen to knight four , threatening to take her king 's pawn with check , and when she protected against this , he could attack the knight with his king bishop pawn , and it would have no place to go . Borgov 's queen would be there to take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could play rook takes pawn , giving up the rook to hers only to get it back with a queen check , coming out a pawn ahead and with an improved position . No . Two pawns ahead . She would have to put her queen on knight three . Queen to queen two was no good because of his damned bishop pawn that could attack her knight . She did not like this defensiveness and studied the board for a long time before moving , trying to find something that would counterattack . There was nothing . She had to move the queen and protect the knight . She felt her cheeks burning and studied the position again . Nothing . She brought her queen to knight three and did not look at Borgov . With no hesitation whatever Borgov brought his bishop to king three , protecting his king . Why had n't she seen that ? She had looked long enough . Now if she pushed the pawn she had planned to push , she would lose her queen . How could she have missed it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new position of her queen , and he had parried it instantly with a move that was chill-  | ingly obvious . She glanced at him , at his well-shaven , imperturbable Russian face with the tie so finely knotted beneath his heavy chin , and the fear she felt almost froze her muscles . She studied the board with all the intensity she could muster , sitting rigidly for twenty minutes staring at the position . Her stomach sank even farther as she tried and rejected a dozen continuations . She could not save the knight . Finally she played her bishop to king two , and Borgov predictably put his queen on knight four , threatening again to win the knight by pushing up his king bishop pawn . Now she had the choice of king to queen two or of castling . Either way the knight was lost . She castled . Borgov immediately moved the bishop pawn to attack her knight . She could have screamed . Everything he was doing was obvious , unimaginative , bureaucratic . She felt stifled and played pawn to queen five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving of the bishop to rook six , threatening to mate . She would have to bring her rook up to protect . He would take the knight with his queen , and if she took the bishop , the queen would pick off the rook in the corner with a check , and the whole thing would blow apart . She would have to bring the rook over to protect it . And meanwhile she was down a knight . Against a world 's champion , whose shirt was impeccably white , whose tie was beautifully tied , whose dark jowled Russian face admitted no doubt or weakness . She saw her hand reach out , and taking the black king by its head , topple it onto the board . She sat there for a moment and heard the applause . Then , looking at no one , she left the room .  | " GIVE ME A TEQUILA SUNRISE , " SHE SAID . THE CLOCK OVER THE BAR pointed to twelve-thirty , and there was a group of four American women at one of the tables at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not eaten breakfast , but she did not want lunch . " Con mucho gusto , " the bartender said . The awards ceremony was at two-thirty . She drank through it in the bar . She would be fourth place , or maybe fifth . The two who had done a grandmaster draw together would be ahead of her with five and a half points each . Borgov had six . Her score was five . She had three tequila sunrises , ate two hard-boiled eggs and shifted to beer . Dos Equis . It took four of them to make the pain in her stomach go away , to blur the fury and shame . Even when it began to ease , she could still see Borgov 's dark , heavy face and could feel the frustration she had felt during their match . She had played like a novice , like a passive , embarrassed fool . She drank a lot , but she did not get dizzy , and her speech did not slur when she ordered . There seemed to be a kind of insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at a table at one end of the cocktail lounge with her glass of beer , and she did not get drunk . At three o'clock two players from the tournament caste into the bat , talking quietly . Beth got up and went straight to her room .  | Mrs. Wheatley was lying in bed . She had a hand on her head with the fingers dug into her hair as though she had a headache . Beth walked over to the bed . Mrs. Wheatley did not look right . Beth reached out and took her by the arm . Mrs. Wheatley was dead . It seemed as though she felt nothing , but five minutes passed before Beth was able to let go of Mrs. Wheatley 's cold arm and pick up the telephone . The manager knew exactly what to do . Beth sat in the armchair drinking cafe con leche from room service while two men with a stretcher came and the manager instructed them . She heard him , but she did not watch . She kept her eyes on the window . Sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray suit , using a stethoscope on Mrs. Wheatley . Mrs. Wheatley was on the bed and the stretcher was under her . The two men in green uniform were standing at the edge of the bed , looking embarrassed . The woman took off her stethoscope , nodded to the manager and came over to Beth . Her face was strained . " I 'm sorry , " she said . Beth looked away from her . " What was it ? " " Hepatitis , possibly . We 'll know tomorrow . " " Tomorrow , " Beth said . " Could you give me a tranquilizer ? " " I have a sedative ... " " I do n't want a sedative , " Beth said . " Can you give me a prescription for Librium ? " The doctor stared at her for a moment and shrugged . " You do n't need a prescription to buy Librium in Mexico . I suggest meprobamate . There 's a farmacia in the hotel . " Using a map in the front of Mrs. Wheatley 's Mobil Travel Guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver , Colorado , and Butte , Montana . The manager had told her his assistant would be of whatever help she needed in phoning , signing papers , dealing with the authorities . Ten minutes after they had taken Mrs. Wheatley away , Beth called the assistant and read him the list of towns and gave him the name . He said he would call her back . She ordered a Coca-Cola grande and more coffee from room service . Then she undressed quickly and took a shower . There was a phone in the bathroom , but the call did not come through . She still felt nothing . She dressed in fresh jeans and a white T-shirt . On the little table by the bed was Mrs. Wheatley 's pack of Chesterfields , empty , c  --  runrpled by Mrs. Wheatley 's hands . The ashtray beside it was hill of butts . One cigarette , the last one Mrs. Wheatley had ever smoked ,  | sat on the edge of the little tray , with a long cold ash . Beth stared at it a minute ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy who brought the big bottle of Coke and the carafe of coffee was very respectful and waved away her attempt to sign the bill . The telephone rang . It was the manager . " I have your call , " he said . " From Denver . " There was a series of clicks in the receiver and then a male voice , surprisingly loud and clear . " This is Allston Wheatley . " " It 's Beth , Mr. Wheatley . " There was a pause . " Beth ? " " Your daughter . Elizabeth Harmon . " " You 're in Mexico ? You 're calling from Mexico ? " " It 's about Mrs. Wheatley . " She was looking at the cigarette , never really smoked , on the ashtray . " How 's Alma ? " the voice said . " Is she there with you ? In Mexico ? " The interest sounded forced . She could picture him as she had seen him at Methuen , wishing he were somewhere else , everything about him saying that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere else . " She 's dead , Mr. Wheatley .

" " They 're going to do an autopsy tomorrow , and I 've got to get new plane tickets . I mean , get a new plane ticket for myself . . . " Her voice had suddenly gone weak and aimless . She picked up the coffee cup and took a drink from it . " I do n't know where to bury her . " Mr. Wheatley 's voice came back with surprising crispness . " Call Durgin Brothers , in Lexington . There 's a family plot in her maiden name . Benson . " " What about the house ? " " Look " ? the voice was louder now ? " I do n't want any part of this .

He knows how to reach me . " There was silence again . Then she said , as strongly as she could , " Do n't you want to know what she died of ? " " What was it ? " " Hepatitis , I think . They 'll know tomorrow . " " Oh , " Mr. Wheatley said . " She was sick a lot . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refund on Mrs. Wheatley 's plane ticket . Beth had to sign some official papers , had to absolve the hotel of responsibility and fill out government forms . One had the title " U.S. Customs  --  Transfer of Remains . " The manager got Durgin Brothers in Lexington . The assistant manager drove Beth to the airport the following day , with the hearse discreetly trailing them through the streets of Mexico City and along the highway . She saw the metal coffin only once , looking out the window from the TWA waiting room . The hearse had driven up to the 707 at the gate and some men were unloading it in brilliant sunlight . They set it on a forklift , and she could hear the dim whine of the engine through the glass as it was raised to the level of the cargo hold . For a moment it trembled in the sunshine and she had a sudden horrific vision of it falling off the lift and crashing to the tarmac , spilling out the embalmed middle-aged corpse of Mrs. Wheatley on the hot gray asphalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled handily into the cargo hold . On board Beth declined a drink from the stewardess . When she had gone back down the aisle , Beth opened her purse and took out one of her new bottles of green pills . She had spent three hours the day before , after signing the papers , going from farmacia to farmacia , buying the limit of one hundred pills in each . The funeral was simple and brief . A half-hour before it began , Bet h took four green pills . She sat in the church alone , in a quiet daze , while the minister said the things ministers say . There were flowers at the altar , and she was mildly surprised to see a pair of men from the funeral home step up and carry them out as soon as the minister had finished . Six other people were there , but Beth knew none of them . One old lady hugged her afterward and said , " You poor dear . " She finished unpacking that afternoon and came down from the 1rrlrrutm 1,1 fix coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went  | into the little downstairs bathroom to wash her face and suddenly , standing there surrounded by blue , by Mrs. Wheatley 's blue bathroom rug and blue towels and blue soap and blue washcloths , something hot exploded in her belly and her face was drenched with tears . She took a towel from the rack and held it against her face and said " Oh Jesus Christ " and leaned against the washbasin and cried for a long time . She was still drying her face when the phone rang . The voice was male . " Beth Harmon ? " " Yes . " " This is Harry Beltik . From the State Tournament . " " I remember . " " Yeah . I hear you dropped one to Borgov . Wanted to give condolences . " As she laid the towel on the back of the overstuffed sofa she noticed a half-finished pack of Mrs. Wheatley 's cigarettes on its arm . " Thanks , " she said , picking up the package and holding on to it tightly . " What were you playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a pause . " Is something wrong ? " " No . " " It 's better that way . " " What 's better ? " " It 's better to be Black if you 're going to lose it . " " I suppose so . " " What 'd you play ? Sicilian ? " She gently set the package of cigarettes back on the chair arm . " Ruy Lopez . I let him do it to me . " " Mistake , " Beltik said . " Look , I 'm in Lexington for the summer . Would you like some training ? " " Training ? " " I know . You 're better than me . But if you 're going to play Russians , you 'll need help . " " Where are you ? " " At the Phoenix Hotel . I 'm moving to an apartment Thursday . " She looked around the room for a moment , at the stack of Mrs. Wheatley 's women 's magazines on the cobbler 's bench , the paleblue drapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellophane still wrapped around their yellowing shades . She took in u long breath and let it out silently . " ( . once on over , " she said . He drove utr twenty minutes later in a 1955 Chevrolet with red-  | and-black flames painted on the fenders and a broken headlamp , pulling up to the curb at the end of the patterned-brick walk . She had been watching for him from the window and was on the front porch when he got out of the car . He waved at her and went to the trunk . He was wearing a bright-red shirt and gray corduroy pants with a pair of sneakers that matched the shirt . There was something dark and quick about him , and Beth , remembering his bad teeth and his fierce way of playing chess , felt herself stiffen a little at the sight of him . He bent over the trunk and lifted out a cardboard box , clearly heavy , tossed the hair out of his eyes and came up the walk . The box said HEINZ TOMATO KETCHUP in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with books . He set it on the living-room rug and unceremoniously took Mrs. Wheatley 's magazines from the coffee table and slipped them into the magazine rack . He began taking books out of the box one at a time , reading off the titles and piling them on the table . " A. L. Deinkopf , Middle Game Strategy ; J. R. Capablanca , My Chess Career ; Fornaut , Alekhine 's Games 1938-1945 ; Meyer , Rook and Pawn Endings . " Some of them were books she had seen before ; a few of them she owned . But most were new to her , heavy-looking and depressing to see . She knew there were a great many things she needed to know . But Capablanca had almost never studied , had played on intuition and his natural gifts , while inferior players like Bogolubov and Griinfeld memorized lines of play like German pedants . She had seen players at tournament after their games had ended , sitting motionless in uncomfortable chairs oblivious to the world , studying opening variations or middle-game strategy or endgame theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy book after another , she felt weary and disoriented . She glanced over at the TV : a part of her wanted to turn it on and forget chess forever . " My summer 's reading , " Beltik said . She shook her head irritably . " I study books . But I 've always tried to play it by ear . " He stopped , holding three copies of Shakhmatni Byulleten in his hands , their covers worn with use , frowning at her . " Like Morphy , " he said , " or Capablanca ? " She was embarrassed . " Yes . " He nodded grimly and set the stack of bullet ins on the floor by the coffee table . " Capablanca would have beaten Borgov . " " Not every game . " 1 ) " 1Hvi  --  ry uatnr 11:1i ( ' ( lllai ( ? ( l " Beltik said .  | She studied his face . He was younger than she remembered him . But she was older now . He was an uncompromising young man ; every part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prima donna , do n't you ? " He permitted himself a small smile . " We 're all prima donnas , " he said . " That 's chess for you . " When she put the TV dinners in the oven that night , they had two boards set up with endgame positions : his set with its green and cream squares , its heavy plastic pieces ; her wooden board with its rosewood and maple men . Both sets were the Staunton pattern that all serious players used ; both had four-inch kings . She had n't invited him to stay for lunch and dinner ; it had been understood . He went to the grocery store a few blocks away for the food while she sat musing over a group of possible rook moves , trying to avoid a draw in a theoretical game . While she made lunch he lectured her about keeping in good physical shape and getting enough sleep . He had also bought the two frozen dinners for supper . " You 've got to stay open , " Beltik said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king knight pawn , say  --  it 's death . Look at this ... " She turned to his board on the kitchen table . He was holding a cup of coffee and standing , frowning down at the board , holding his chin with the other hand . " Look at what ? " she said , irritated . He reached down , picked up the white rook , moved it across the board to king rook one  --  the lower right-hand corner . " Now his rook pawn 's pinned . " " So what ? " " He 's got to move the king now or he gets stuck later . " " I see that , " she said , her voice a little softer now . " But I do n't see " Look at the queenside pawns , way over here . " He pointed to the other side of the board , at the three white pawns interlinked . She walked over to the table to get a better look . " He can do this , " she said , and moved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Try it . " " Okay . " She sat down behind the pieces . In half a dozen moves Beltik had gotten his queen bishop pawn to the seventh rank and queening it was inevitable . It would cost the rook and the game to stop it . Ile had been right ; it was necessary to move the king when the rook had cone across the board . " You were right , " she said . " Did you figure it out : ' "  | Beltik went back to his hotel after midnight , and Beth stayed up for several hours reading the middle-game book , not setting up the positions on a board but reviewing them in her imagination . One thing bothered her , but she did not let herself dwell on it . She could not picture the pieces as easily as she had when she was eight and nine years old . She could still do it , but it was more of an effort and sometimes she was uncertain about where a pawn or a bishop belonged and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She played on doggedly into the night , using her mind and the book only , sitting in Mrs. Wheatley 's old television-watching armchair in T-shirt and blue jeans . Every now and then she would blink and look around her , half expecting to see Mrs. Wheatley sitting nearby with her stockings rolled down and her black pumps on the floor beside her chair . Beltik was back at nine the next morning , with half a dozen more books . They had coffee and played a few five-minute games on the kitchen table . Beth won all of them , decisively , and when they had finished the fifth game Beltik looked at her and shook his head . " Harmon , " he said , " you have really got it . But it 's improvisation . " She stared at him . " What the hell , " she said . " I wiped you out five times . " He looked back across the table at her coolly and took a sip from his coffee cup . " I 'm a master , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . But I 'm not what you 're going to be up against if you go to Paris . " " I can beat Borgov with a little more work . " " You can beat Borgov with a lot more work . Years more work . What in hell do you think he is ? Another Kentucky ex-champion like me ? " " He 's World Champion . But ? " " Oh , shut up ! " Beltik said . " Borgov could have beaten both of us when he was ten . Do you know his career ? " Beth looked at him . " No , I do n't . " Beltik got up from the table and walked purposively into the living room . He pulled a green jacketed book from the stack next to Beth 's chessboard and brought it to the kitchen , tossing it on the table in front of her . hasily Borgov : My Life in Chess . " Read it tonight , " he said . " Read the games from Leningrad 1962 and look at the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luchenko and with Spassky . " He picked up his near-empty coffee cup . " You Wright learn something . "  | It was the first week in June and japoncia blazed in bright coral outside the kitchen window . Mrs. Wheatley 's azaleas had begun to bloom and the grass needed mowing . There were birds . It was a beautiful week of the best kind of Kentucky spring . Sometimes late at night after Beltik had left , Beth would go out to the backyard to feel the warmth on her cheeks and to take a few deep breaths of warm clean air , but the rest of the time she ignored the world outside . She had become caught up in chess in a new way . Her bottles of Mexican tranquilizers remained unused in the nightstand ; the cans of beer in the refrigerator stayed in the refrigerator . After standing in the backyard for five minutes , she would go back into the house and read Beltik 's chess books for hours and then go upstairs and fall into bed exhausted . On Thursday afternoon Beltik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment tomorrow . The hotel bill is killing me . " They were in the middle of the Benoni Defense . She had just played the P-K5 he had taught her , on move eight  --  a move Beltik said came from a player named Mikenas . She looked up from the position . " Where is it ? The apartment . " " New Circle Road . I wo n't be coming by so much . " " It 's not that far . " " Maybe not . But I 'll be taking classes . I ought to get a part-time job . " " You could move in here , " she said . " Free . " He looked at her for a moment and smiled . His teeth were n't really so bad . " I thought you 'd never ask , " he said . She had not been so immersed in chess since she was a little girl . lieltik was in class three afternoons a week and two mornings , and she spent that time studying his books . She played mentally through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in offense and defense , biting her lip sometimes in excitement over a dazzling move or a subtlety of position , and at other times wearied by a sense of the hopeless depth of chess , of its endlessness , move alter move , threat after threat , complication after complication . She had heard of the genetic code that could shape an eye or hand from passing proteins . Deoxyribonucleic acid . It contained the entire set of instructions for constructing a respiratory system and a digestive one , as well as the grip of an infant 's hand . Chess was like that . The geometry of a position could he read and reread and not exhausted of possibility . You saw deeply into this layer of it , but there was another laver beyond that , and another .  | Sex , with its reputation for complexity , was refreshingly simple . At least for Beth and Harry . They were in bed together on his second night in the house . It took ten minutes and was punctuated by a few sharp intakes of breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterward he went to his bed in her old room and she slept easily , falling asleep to images not of love but of wooden counters on a wooden board . The next morning she played him at breakfast and the combinations arose from her fingertips and spread themselves on the board as prettily as flowers . She beat him four quick games , letting him play the white pieces each time and hardly looking at the board . While he was washing the dishes he talked about Philidor , one of his heroes . Philidor was a French musician who had played blindfolded in Paris and London . " I read about those old players sometimes , and it all seems strange , " she said . " I ca n't believe it was really chess . " " Do n't knock it , " Beltik said . " Bent Larsen plays Philidor 's Defense . " " It 's too cramped . The king 's bishop gets locked in . " " It 's solid , " he said . " What I wanted to tell you about Philidor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diderot ? " " The French Revolution ? " " Yeah . Philidor was doing blindfold exhibitions and burning out his brain , or whatever it was they thought you did in the eighteenth century . Diderot wrote him : It is foolish to run the risk of going mad for vanity 's sake . ' I think of that sometimes when I 'm analyzing my ass off over a chessboard . " He looked at her quietly for a moment . " Last night was nice , " he said . She sensed that for him it was a concession to talk about it , and her feelings were mixed . " Does n't Koltanowski play blindfolded all the time ? " she said . " He 's not crazy . " " I know . It was Morphy who went crazy . And Steinitz . Morphy thought people were trying to steal his shoes . " " Maybe he thought shoes were bishops . " " Yeah , " he said . " Let 's play chess . " By the end of the third week she had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game books . One day after he had been in an engineering class all morning they were studying a position together . She was trying to show him why a particular knight move was stronger than it looked .  | " Look here , " she said and began moving the pieces around fast . " Knight takes and then this pawn comes up . If he does n't bring it up , the bishop is locked in . When he does , the other pawn falls . Zip . " She took the pawn off . " What about the other bishop ? Over here ? " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " she said . " It 'll have the check once the pawn is moved and the knight 's traded . Ca n't you see that ? " Suddenly he froze and glared at her . " No , I ca n't " he said . " I ca n't find it that fast . " She looked back at him . " I wish you could , " she said levelly . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hurt underneath his anger , and she softened . " I miss them too , sometimes , " she said . He shook his head . " No , you do n't , " he said . " Not anymore . " On Saturday she started playing him with odds of a knight . He tried to act casual about it , but she could see that he hated it . There was no other way for them to have a real game . Even with the odds and with his playing the white pieces she beat him the first two and drew the third . That night he did not come to her bed , nor did he the next . She did not miss the sex , which meant very little to her , but she missed something . On the second night she had some difficulty going to sleep and found herself gettng up at two in the morning . She went to the refrigerator and got out one of Mrs. Wheatley 's cans of beer . " Then she sat down at the chessboard and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She played over some Queen 's ( ; ambit games : Alekhine-Yates ; Tarrasch-von Scheve ; Lasker-Tarrasch . The first of these was one she had memorized years before at Morris ' Book Store ; the other two she had analyzed with Beltik during their first week together . In the last there was a beautiful pawn to Queen 's rook four on the fifteenth move , as sweetly deadly as a pawn move could be . She left it on the board for the time it took to chink two beers , just looking at it . It was a warm night and the kitchen window was open ; moths battered at the screen and somewhere far away a dog was barking . She sat at the table wearing Mrs. Wheatley 's pink chenille robe and drinking Mrs. Wheatley 's beer , feeling relaxed and easy in herself . She was glad to be alone . There were t hree more beers in t he refrigerator , and she finished all of Ihcin . Then she went back up to bed and slept soundly until nine in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , I 've taught you everything I know . " She started to say something but kept silent . " I 've got to start studying . I 'm supposed to be an electrical engineer , not a chess bum . " " Okay , " she said . " You 've taught me a lot . " They were quiet for a few minutes . She finished her eggs and took her plate to the sink . " I 'm moving to that apartment , " Beltik said . " It 's closer to the university . " " Okay , " Beth said , not turning from the sink . He was gone by noon . She took a TV dinner from the freezer for her lunch but did n't turn on the oven . She was alone in the house , her stomach was in a knot , and she did not know any place to go . There were no movies she wanted to see or people she wanted to call ; there was nothing she wanted to read . She walked up the stairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung in the closets and a half bottle of her tranquilizers was still on the nightstand by the unmade bed . The tension she felt would not go away . Mrs. Wheatley was gone , her body buried in a cemetery at the edge of town , and Harry Beltik had driven off with his chessboard and books , not even waving goodbye as he left . For a moment she had wanted to shout at him to stay with her , but she said nothing as he went down the steps and into his car . She took the bottle from the nightstand and shook three of the green pills into her hand , and then a fourth . She hated being alone . She swallowed the four pills without water , the way she had as a child . In the afternoon she bought herself a steak and a large baking potato at Kroger 's . Before pushing her cart to the checkout , she went to the wine-and-beer case and took out a fifth of burgundy . That night she watched televison and got drunk . She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the set to turn it off . Sometime during the night she awoke to a sense that the room was reeling . She had to vomit . Afterward , when she went upstairs to bed , she found that she was fully awake and very clear in her mind . There was a burning sensation in her stomach , and her eyes were wide open in the dark room as though looking for light . There was a powerful ache at the back of her neck . She reached over , found the bottle and took more tranquilizers . Eventually she went to sleep again . She awoke the next morning with a crushing headache and a de-  | Harry Beltik was gone . The U.S. Championship was in three weeks ; she had been invited to it before going to Mexico , and if she was going to win it , she was going to have to beat Benny Watts . While her coffee was percolating in the kitchen , she poured out the leftover burgundy from the night before , threw away the empty bottle and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invitation had come . One was the game record from the last U.S. Championship and the other was called Benny Watts : My Fifty Best Games of Chess . On its dustjacket was a blowup of Benny 's Huckleberry Finn face . Seeing it now , she winced at the memory of losing , at her damnfool attempt to double his pawns . She got herself a cup of coffee and opened the book , forgetting her hangover . By noon she had analyzed six of the games and was getting hungry . There was a little restaurant two blocks away , the kind of place that has liver and onions on the menu and display cards of cigarette lighters at the cashier 's stand . She brought the book with her and went over two more games while eating her hamburger and home fries . When the lemon custard came and was too thick and sweet to eat , she felt a sudden pang of longing for Mrs. Wheatley and the French desserts they had shared in places like Cincinnati and Houston . She shook it off , ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going over : the King 's Indian Defense , with the black bishop fianchettoed in the upper right-hand corner of the board , looking down the long diagonal for a chance to pounce . Black worked the king 's side while White worked the queen 's side after the bishop went into the corner . Very civilized . Benny , playing Black , won it handily . She paid her check and left . For the rest of the day and night until one in the morning she played over all of the games in the book . When she had finished , she knew a great deal more about Benny Watts and about precision chess than she had known before . She took two of her Mexican tranquilizers and went to bed , falling asleep instantly . She awoke pleasantly at nine-thirty the next morning . While her breakfast eggs were boiling , she chose a book for morning study : Paul Morphy and the Golden Age of Chess . It was an old hook , in some ways outdated . The diagrams were grayish and cluttered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . But mallet hing in her could still thrill at the name Paul Morphy and at the idea of that strange New Orleans prodigy , well-bred , a lawyer , son of ' a high court judge , who when young dazzled the world with his chess and then quit playing altogether and lapsed into muttering paranoia and an early death . When Months , ulaved the King 's  | Gambit he sacrificed knights and bishops with abandon and then moved in on the black king with dizzying speed . There had never been anything like him before or since . It made her spine tingle just to open the book and see the games list : Morphy-Lowenthal ; Morphy-Harrwitz ; Morphy-Anderssen , followed by dates in the eighteen-fifties . Morphy would stay up all night in Paris before his games , drinking in cafes and talking with strangers , and then would play the next day like a shark  --  well-mannered , well-dressed , smiling , moving the big pieces with small , ladylike , blue-veined hands , crushing one European master after another . Someone had called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only he and Capablanca had lived at the same time and played each other ! She began going over a game between Morphy and someone named Paulsen , played in 1857 . The U.S. Championship would be in three weeks ; it was time it was won by a woman . It was time she won it .  | WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM , SHE SAW A THIN YOUNG MAN wearing faded blue jeans and a matching denim shirt seated at one of the tables . His blond hair came almost to his shoulders . It was only when he rose and said , " Hello , Beth , " that she saw it was Benny Watts . The hair had been long in the cover photograph of Chess Review a few months before , but not that long . He looked pale and thin and very calm . Still , Benny had always been calm . " Hello , " she said . " I read about the game with Borgov . " Benny smiled . " It must have felt terrible . " She looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retie . And she did not hate him anymore for beating her ; there was only one player she hated now , and he was in Russia . " I felt like a fool , " she said . " I know . " He shook his head . " Helpless . It all goes , and you just push wood . " She stared at him . Chess players did not talk so easily about humiliations , did not admit weakness . She started to say something , when t he tournament director spoke up loudly . " Play will begin in live minutes . " She nodded to Benny , attempted a smile , and found her table . There was n't a face over a chessboard that she did n't know from  | hotel ballrooms where tournaments were played or from photographs in Chess Review . She herself had been on the cover six months after Townes took her picture in Las Vegas . Half the other players here on this campus in the small Ohio town had been on the cover themselves at one time or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , a middle-aged master named Phillip Resnais , was on the cover of the current issue . There were fourteen players , many of them grandmasters . She was the only woman . They played in some kind of lecture room with dark-green blackboards along the wall at one end and fluorescent lights recessed into the ceiling . There was a row of large institutional windows along one blue wall , with bushes , trees and a wide stretch of the campus visible through them . At one end of the room were five rows of folding chairs , and out in the hallway a sign announced a visitor 's fee of four dollars per session . During her first game there were about twentyfive people watching . A display board hung above each of the seven game tables , and two directors moved silently between the tables , changing the pieces after moves had been made on the real boards . The spectators ' seats were on a wooden platform to give them a view of the playing surfaces . But it was all second-rate , even the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , assembled here in a single room , but it had the feel of a high school tournament . If it were golf or tennis , Benny Watts and she would be surrounded by reporters , would be playing under something other than these fluorescent lights and on plastic boards with cheap plastic pieces , watched by a few polite middle-aged people with nothing better to do . Phillip Resnais seemed to take it all seriously , but she felt like walking out . She did not , however . When he played pawn to king four , she pushed up her queen bishop pawn and started the Sicilian Defense . Now she was in the middle of the Rossolimo-Nimzovitch Attack , getting equality on the eleventh move with pawn to queen three . It was a move she had gone over with Beltik , and it worked the way Beltik said it would work . By the fourteenth move she had him on the run , and by the twentieth it was decisive . He resigned on the twenty-sixth . She looked around her at the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt better about the whole thing . It would be good to be U.S. ( . ' hampion . If she could beat Benny Watts .  | She had a small private room in a dormitory with the bathroom down the hall . It was austerely furnished , but there was no sense of anyone else 's having lived in it , and she liked that . For the first several days she took her meals alone in the cafeteria and spent the evenings either at the desk in her room or in bed , studying . She had brought a suitcase full of chess books with her . They were lined up neatly at the back of the desk . She had also brought tranquilizers , just in case , but she did not even open the bottle during the first week . Her one game a day went smoothly , and although some of them lasted three or four hours and were grueling , she was never in danger of losing . As time went on , the other players looked at her with more and more respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing as well as she . The games were printed up every night from a Xerox in the college library , and copies were given to the players and spectators . She went over them in the evenings and mornings , playing some out on her board but going through most of them in her head . She always took the trouble to set up the game Benny had played and actually move the pieces , carefully studying the way he had played it . In a round robin each player met each of the others one time ; she would meet Benny in the eleventh game . Since there were thirteen games and the tournament lasted two weeks , there was one day off  --  the first Sunday . She slept late that morning , stayed a long time in the shower , and then took a long walk around the campus . It was very tranquil , with well-mowed lawns and elm trees and an occasional patch of flowers  --  a serene Midwestern Sunday morning , but she missed the competition of the match . She momentarily considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a dozen places to drink beer , but thought better of it . She did not want to erode any more brain cells . She looked at her watch ; it was eleven o'clock . She headed for the Student Union Building , where the cafeteria was . She would get some coffee . There was a pleasant wood-paneled lounge on the main floor . When she came in , Benny Watts was sitting on a beige corduroy sofa at the far end of it with a chessboard and clock on the table in front of him . Two other players were standing nearby , and he was smiling at there , explaining something about the game in front of him . She had started downstairs for the cafeteria when Benny 's voice called to her . " Conte on over . " She hesitated , turned and walked  | over . She recognized the other two players at once ; one of them she had beaten two days before with the Queen 's Gambit . " Look at this , Beth , " Benny said , pointing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " She looked at it a moment . " The Lopez ? " " That 's right . " She was a little irritated . She wanted a cup of coffee . The position was delicate , and it took concentration . The other players remained silent . Finally she saw what was needed . She bent over wordlessly , picked up the knight at king three and set it down on queen five . " See ! " Benny said to the others , laughing . " Maybe you 're right , " one of them said . " I know I 'm right . And Beth here thinks the same way I do . The pawn move 's too weak . " " The pawn works only if he plays his bishop , " Beth said , feeling better . " Exactly ! " Benny said . He was wearing jeans and some kind of loose white blouse . " How about some skittles , Beth ? " " I was on my way for coffee , " she said . " Barnes 'll get you coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soft-looking young man , a grandmaster , nodded assent . " Sugar and cream ? " " Yes . " Benny was pulling a dollar bill out of his jeans pocket . He handed it to Barnes . " Get me some apple juice . But not in one of those plastic cups . Get a milk glass . " Benny set the clock by the board . He held out two pawns concealed in his hands , and the hand Beth tapped had the white one . After they set up the pieces Benny said , " Would you like to bet ? " " Bet ? " " We could play for five dollars a game . " " I have n't had my coffee yet . " " Here it comes . " Beth saw Barnes hurrying across the room with a glass of juice and a white Styrofoam cup . " Okay , " she said . " Five dollars . " " Have some coffee , " Benny said , " and I 'll punch your clock . " She took it from Barnes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee table . " Go ahead , " she said to Benny . She felt very good . The spring morning outdoors was all right , but this was what she loved . He beat her with only three minutes on his clock . She played well but he played brilliantly , moving almost immediately each time , wring through whatever she tried doing to him . She handed him a  | five-dollar bill from the billfold in her pocket and set up the pieces again , this time taking the black ones for herself . There were four other players standing nearby now , watching them . She tried the Sicilian against his pawn to king four , but he wiped it away with a pawn gambit and got her into an irregular opening . He was incredibly fast . She had him in trouble at midgame with doubled rooks on an open file , but he ignored them and attacked down the center , letting her check him twice with the rooks , exposing his king . But when she tried to bring a knight into it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then her king , catching her finally in a mating net . She resigned before he could move in for the kill . She gave him a ten this time and he gave her the five back . She had sixty dollars in her pocket and more money back at the room . By noon there were forty or more people watching . Most of the players from the tournament were there along with some of the spectators who regularly attended the games , college students and a group of men who might have been professors . She and Benny kept playing , not even talking now between games . Beth won the third one with a beautiful save just before her flag dropped , but she lost the next four and drew the fifth . Some of the positions were brilliantly complex , but there was no time for analysis . It was thrilling but frustrating . She had never in her life been beaten so consistently , and although it was only five-minute chess and not serious , it was an immersion in quiet humiliation . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the game with precision and responded accurately to every threat , mounted powerful threats of her own , but it meant nothing . Benny seemed to have some resource beyond her understanding , and he won game after game from her . She felt helpless , and inside her there grew a quiet sense of of empty Styrofoam cups sat by the board . When she got up to leave , there was applause and Benny shook her hand . She wanted to hit him but said nothing . There was random applause from the crowd in the room . As she was leaving , the man she had played the first of the week , Phillip Resnais , stopped her . " I would n't worry about it , " he said . " Benny plays speed chess as well as anyone in the world . It does n't really mean a lot . " She nodded curtly and thanked him . When she went outside into the late-afternon sunlight , she Hi like a fool . ' That night she stayed in her room and took tranquilizers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , but stupid . Mrs. Wheatley had once described things as looking askew ; that was how they looked to Beth when she awoke from her deep , tranquilized sleep . But she no longer felt the humiliation she had felt after being beaten by Benny . She took her pill bottle from the bedstand drawer and squeezed the top on it tight . It would not do to take any more . Not until the tournament was over . She thought suddenly of Thursday , the day she would play Benny , and she tensed . But she put the pills back in the drawer and got dressed . She ate breakfast early and drank three cups of strong coffee with it . Then she took a brisk walk around the main part of the campus , playing through one of the games from Benny Watts 's book . He was brilliant , she told herself , but not unbeatable . Anyway , she would n't play him for three more days . The games started at one and went on until four or five in the afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next day . By noon her head was clear and when she started her one o'clock game against a tall , silent Californian in a Black Power T-shirt , she was ready for him . Although he wore his hair in a kind of Afro , he was white  --  as all of them were . She answered his English Opening with both knights , making it a fourknights game , and decided against her normal practice to trade him down to an endgame . It worked beautifully , and she was pleased with her handling of the pawns ; she had one on the sixth and one on the seventh rank when he resigned . It was easier than she had expected ; her endgame study with Beltik had paid off . That evening Benny Watts joined her at the cafeteria table while she was eating her dessert . " Beth , " he said , " it 's going to be you or me . " She looked up from her rice pudding . " Are you trying to psych me out ? " He laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She went on eating and said nothing . " Look , " he said , " I 'm sorry about yesterday . I was n't trying to hustle you . " She took a sip of coffee . " You were n't ? " " I just wanted some action . " " And money , " Beth said . Although that was n't the point . " You 're the best player here , " he said . " I 've been reading your games . You attack like Alekhine . " " You held me off well enough yesterday . " " ' I'hat does n't count . I know speed chess better than you . I play a lot of it in New York . "  | " You beat me in Las Vegas . " " That was a long time ago . You were too wrapped up in doubling my pawns . I could n't get away with that again . " She finished her coffee in silence while he ate his dinner and drank his milk . When he had finished , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're alone ? I mean , play all the way through them ? " He smiled . " Does n't everybody ? " She permitted herself to watch television in the lounge of the Student Union Building that evening . Benny was n't there , although a few of the other players were . She went back to her room afterward , feeling lonely . It was her first tournament since Mrs. Wheatley died , and she missed her now . She took the endgame book from the collection on the desk and began studying . Benny was all right . It had been nice of him to talk to her that way . And she had gotten used to his hair by now ; she liked it long , the way it was . He had really very good-looking hair . She won Tuesday 's game , and Wednesday 's . Benny was still playing when she finished on Wednesday and she walked over to his table and saw in a moment that he had it all but won . He looked up at her and smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tomorrow . " There was a children 's playground at the edge of the campus . She walked to it by moonlight and sat on one of the swings . What she really wanted was a drink , but that was out of the question . A bottle of red wine , with a little cheese . Then a few pills and off to bed . But she could n't . She had to be clear in the morning , had to be ready for the game against Benny Watts at one o'clock . Maybe she could take one pill and go to bed . Or , two . She would take two . She swung herself back and forth a few times , listening to the squeaking of the chain that held the swing , before heading purposively back to the dormitory . She took the two pills , but it still was over an hour before she could sleep . Something in the deferential manner of the tournament directors and the way the other players looked at her told her that the attention of t he tournament had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only players who had come this far without even a draw . In a round robin there was no precedence of boards ; they would play at the thirst table in the row that began at the classroom door . But attention was centered on that table . and the snectators. who had al-  | ready filled the seats and now included a dozen people standing , all became quiet as she seated herself . Benny came in a minute after she did ; there was whispering when he arrived at the table and sat down . She looked over at the crowd , and a thought that had been present in her mind suddenly solidified itself : the two of them were the best players in America . Benny was wearing his faded denim shirt with a silver medallion on a chain . His sleeves were rolled up like a laborer 's . He was not smiling , and he looked a good deal older than twenty-four . He glanced briefly at the crowd , nodded almost imperceptibly to Beth , and stared at the board as the tournament director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white pieces . Beth punched his clock . He played pawn to king four , and she did not hesitate ; she replied with pawn to queen bishop four : the Sicilian . He brought out the king knight , and she played pawn to king three . There was no point in using an obscure opening against Benny . He knew openings better than she . The place to get him would be in the middle game , if she could mount an attack before he did . But first she would have to get equality . She felt a sensation she had felt only once before , in Mexico City playing Borgov : she felt like a child trying to outsmart an adult . When she made her second move , she looked across the board at Benny and saw the quiet seriousness of his face and felt unready for this game with him . But it was n't so . She knew in part of herself that it was n't , that in Mexico City she had overwhelmed a string of professionals before wilting in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this tournament , that even when she had been playing the janitor at Methuen Home as an eight-year-old she had played with a solidity that was altogether remarkable , altogether professional . Yet she felt now , however illogically , inexperienced . Benny thought for several minutes and made an unusual move . Instead of playing the queen pawn , he pushed the queen bishop pawn to the fourth rank . It sat there , facing her queen bishop pawn , unsupported . She looked at it for a minute , wondering what he had in mind . He might be going for the Maroczy Bind , but doing it out of the normal sequence . It was new  --  something probably planned especially for this game . She suddenly felt embarrassed , aware that although she had gone through Benny 's game book , she had prepared not hing special for today and had approached it as she always anuroached chess . ready to olav by intuition and attack .  | And then she began to see that there was nothing sinister about Benny 's move , nothing she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not have to play into it . She could decline the invitation . If she played her knight to queen bishop three , his move might be wasted . Maybe he was only fishing for a quick advantage  --  as though playing speed chess . She brought her knight out . What the hell , as Alma Wheatley would say . Benny played pawn to queen four ; she took the pawn , and he retook with his knight . She brought out the other knight and waited for him to bring out his . She would pin it when he did and then take it , getting doubled pawns . That queen bishop pawn move of his was costing him , and although the advantage was n't much , it was certain . But he did not bring out the knight . Instead he took hers . Clearly he did n't want the doubled pawn . She let that sink in a moment before retaking . It was astounding ; he was already on the defensive . A few minutes before , she had felt like an amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the third move and had put himself in trouble . The obvious thing was to take his knight with her knight pawn , capturing toward the center . If she took the other way , with her queen pawn , he would trade queens . That would prevent her from castling and would deny her the queen she loved for quick attack . She reached her hand out to take the knight with the knight pawn and then brought it back . Somehow the idea of opening the queen file , shocking though it was , looked attractive . She began to study it . And gradually it began to make sense . With an early queen trade , castling would be irrelevant . She could bring the king out the way you did in the endgame . She looked across at Benny again and saw that he was wondering why she was taking so long with this routine recapture . Somehow he looked smaller to her . What the hell , she thought again and took with the queen pawn , exposing her queen . Benny did not hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock smartly . He did not even say " Check . " She took with her king as she had to , and he pushed up the other bishop pawn to protect his king pawn . It was a simple defensive move , but something in her exulted when he did it . She felt naked with no queen this early in the game , yet she was beginning to feel strong without it . She already had the initiative , and she knew it . She pushed her pawn to king fins . It was not an obvious move at this stage , and the soundness of ' it warmed her . It opened up the diagonal for her queen bishop and held his king pawn to the fourth rank . She looked up  | from the board and around her . All the other games were intently in progress ; the spectators were hushed , watching . There were more people standing , and they were standing where they could see the game she was playing with Benny . The director came by and made the move on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king pawn to king four . The spectators began to take that in . She looked to the other side of the room and out the window . It was a beautiful day , with fresh leaves on the trees and an impeccably blue sky . She felt herself expand , relax , open up . She was going to beat him . She was going to beat him soundly . The continuation she found on the nineteenth move was a beautiful and subtle wonder . It sprang to her mind full-blown , with half a dozen moves as clear as if they were projected on a screen in front of her , her rook , bishop and knight dancing together down in his king 's corner of the board . Yet there was no checkmate in it or even an advantage in material . After her knight came to queen five on the twenty-fifth move and Benny was forced merely to push a pawn because he could do nothing to defend , she traded rook and knight for rook and knight and brought her king to queen three . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of counting moves . It would take twelve for him to get a pawn to the eighth rank and queen it , while she could do it in ten . Benny made a few moves , bringing his king out in the hopeless attempt to take off her pawns before she took away his , but even his arm as it moved the king was listless . And when she took his queen bishop pawn , he reached out and toppled his king . There was silence and then quiet applause . She had won in thirty moves . As they were leaving the room Benny said to her , " I never thought you 'd let me trade queens . " " I did n't either , " she said .  | AFTER THE CEREMONY SATURDAY EVENING , BENNY TOOK HER TO A bar in town . They sat in a back booth and Beth drank her first beer and ordered another . They both tasted delicious . " Easy , " Benny said . " Easy . " He had not finished his first . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt high enough already . No losses . No draws . Her last two opponents had offered draws in midgame , and she had refused . " A perfect score , " Benny said . " It feels good , " she said , meaning the victory , but the beer felt good too . She looked at him more closely . " I appreciate the way you 're taking it . " " A mask , " he said . " I 'm raging inwardly . " " It does n't show . " " I should not have played that goddamned bishop pawn . " They sat silently for a while . He took a thoughtful sip of beer and asked , " What are you going to do about Borgov ? " " When I go to Paris ? I do n't even have a passport . " " When you go to Moscow . " " 1 do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Do n't they deliver the mail in Kentucky ? " " ( ) f course they do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited . "  | " I want another beer , " she said . " You did n't know that ? " Benny looked shocked . " I 'll get the beer myself . " " Go ahead . " She went up to the bar and ordered another bottle . She had heard of the Moscow Invitational but knew nothing about it . The bartender brought her the beer , and she told him to get another . When she came back to the table , Benny said , " That 's too much beer . " " Probably . " She waited for the foam to settle and took a swallow . " How do I get to Moscow if I go ? " " When I went , the Federation bought my ticket and a church group put up the rest . " " Did you have a second ? " " Barnes . " " Barnes ? " She stared at him . " It would be tough to be in Russia alone . " He frowned . " You should n't drink beer like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down the glass . " Who else will be playing in Moscow ? " " Four other countries and the four top Russians . " That would mean Luchenko and Borgov . Possibly Shapkin . She did not want to think about it . She looked at him quietly for a minute . " Benny , I like the way your hair looks . " He stared at her . " Sure you do , " he said . " What about Russia ? " She took another drink of beer . She did like Benny 's hair and his blue eyes . She had never thought of him sexually before , but she was thinking that way now . " Four Russian chessplayers , " she said , " is a lot of Russian chess players . " " Murderous . " He raised his glass and finished off his beer . He had drunk only the one . " Beth , " he said , " you 're the only American I know who might do it . " " I went to pieces with Borgov in Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Benny said . " In five weeks . " " Then get your life organized around that and study . Get a trainer . " " What about you ? " He thought a moment . " Can you come to New York ? " " I do n't know . " " You can sleep in my living room , and leave for Paris from t here . " The idea shocked her . " I 've got a house to take care of , in Kent uc  --  kv .. ,  | " Let the fucking house fall down . " " I 'm not ready ... " " When will you be ? Next year ? Ten years ? " " I do n't know . " He leaned forward and said slowly , " If you do n't do it , you 'll drink your talent away . It 'll go down the drain . " " Borgov made me look like a fool . " " You were n't ready . " " I do n't know how good I really am . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the best there is . " She took a deep breath . " All right . I 'll come to New York . " " You can come with me from here , " he said . " I 'll drive us . " " When ? " This was happening too fast . She felt frightened . " Tomorrow afternoon , when everything here 's finished . Whenever we can get away . " He stood up . " And about sex ... " She looked up at him . " Forget it , " he said . " Spring , " Benny said , " is first class . Absolutely first class . " " How can you tell ? " Beth asked . They were driving along a gray asphalt section of the Pennsylvania Turnpike , pounding along the gritty road with semis and dusty passenger cars . " It 's out there somewhere . Up in the hills . It 's even in New York . " " Ohio was pleasant , " Beth said . But she did n't like this discussion . Weather did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house in Lexington , had not been able to get the lawyer on the telephone and did not know what to expect in New York . She did not like Benny 's insouciance in the face of her uncertainty , the kind of sunny blankness that suffused his face from time to time . He had looked that way during the awards ceremony and during the time she did her interviews and signed autographs and thanked the officials and the USCF people who had come down from upstate New York to talk about the importance of chess . His face was blank now . She turned her eyes to the road . After a while he spoke up . " When you go to Russia I want to go with you . " That was a surprise . They had n't talked about Russia , or chess , since getting in the car . " As my second ? " " Whatever . I ca n't afford to pay expenses . " " You want inc to pay them ? " " Something will turn tip . While you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said there would n't be any Federation money for seconds . " " I 'm only thinking about Paris , " she said . " I have n't decided to go to Moscow yet . " " You 'll go . " " I do n't even know if I 'm going to stay more than a few days with you . I have to get a passport . " " We can do that in New York . " She started to say something but did n't . She looked at Benny . Now that blankness had left his face , she felt warmer toward him . She had made love to two men in her life , and it was hardly making love ; if she and Benny went to bed together , there would be more to it . She would see there was more to it . They would be in his apartment by midnight ; maybe something would happen there . Maybe he would feel differently at home . " Let 's play chess , " Benny said . " I 'll be White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pawn to queen bishop four . " " N , " he said , using the letter for " knight . " " K-B3 . " " Pawn to queen three . " She was n't sure she liked this . She had never shared her interior chessboard before , and there was a sense of violation in opening it to Benny 's moves . " P to Q four , " Benny said . " Pawn takes pawn . " " Knight takes . " " Knight . King bishop three . " Actually it was easy . She could look at the road ahead and at the same time see the imaginary chessboard and the pieces on it without difficulty . " N to QB3 , " Benny said . " Pawn to king 's knight three . " " P to B four . " " P to B four . " " The Levenfish , " Benny said dryly . " I never liked it . " " Play your knight . " Suddenly his voice was like ice . " Do n't tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if stung . They drove in silence for a few miles . Beth watched the gray steel divider that separated them from the oncoming lanes . Then , as they were coming to a tunnel , Benny said , " You were right about the knight on B-3 . I 'll put it there . " She hesitated a moment before speaking . " Okay . I 'll take the knight . "  | " Pawn takes , " Benny said . " Pawn to king five . " " Pawn takes again , " Benny said . " Do you know what Scharz says about that one ? The footnote ? " " I do n't read footnotes , " Beth said , . " It 's time you started . " " I do n't like Scharz . " " I do n't either , " Benny said . " But I read him . What 's your move ? " " Queen takes queen . Check . " She could hear the sullenness in her voice . " King takes , " Benny said , relaxing now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to resign on the twenty-seventh move and felt somewhat better for it . She had always liked the Sicilian . There were plastic bags full of garbage in the entryway to Benny 's apartment and the light overhead was only a dirty bare bulb . It was a white tile hallway and as depressing at midnight as the toilet in a bus station . There were three locks on Benny 's front door , which was painted red and had some inpenetrable word like " Bezbo " written on it in black spray paint . Inside was a small and cluttered living room with books piled everywhere . But the lighting was pleasant when he got the lamps on . One end of the room was a kitchen , and near it was a door going off to the bedroom . There was a grass rug and no sofa and chairs just black pillows to sit on with lamps beside them . The bathroom was orthodox enough , with a floor made of blackand-while tile and a broken handle on the hot-water tap . There was a tub and shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and face and came back into the living room . Benny had gone into the bedroom to unpack . Her bag was still on the living-room floor next to a bookcase . She walked over to it and looked wearily at the books . They were all on chess  --  all five shelves of them . Some were in Russian and German , but they were all on chess . She walked across t he . hard little rug to the other side of the room where there was another bookcase , this one made of boards resting on bricks . More chess . One whole shelf was Shakhrnatni Byulleten going back to the nineteen-1i tics . " There 's room in t his closet , " Benny shouted from the bedroom . " You can hang up when you want to . " " Okay , " she said . Back on the turnpike she had thought they  | might make love when they got here . Now she wanted only to sleep . And what was she supposed to sleep on ? " I thought I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the doorway . " I said living room . ' " He went back to the bedroom and returned with a bulky-looking thing and some kind of pump . He flipped it out in the middle of the floor and began pedaling the pump with his foot , and after a while it puffed up and became an air mattress . " I 'll get sheets , " Benny said . He brought them out of the bedroom . " I 'll do it , " she said and took them from him . She did n't like the looks of the mattress , but she knew where her pills were . She could get them out after he fell asleep , if she needed to . There would be nothing to drink in this apartment . Benny had not said so , but she knew . She must have fallen asleep before Benny did , since she forgot about the pills in her luggage . She awoke to the sound of a klaxon outside  --  an ambulance or fire truck . When she tried to sit up she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang her legs over . She pushed herself up and stood , wearing pajamas , and looked around . Benny was standing at the sink counter with his back to her . She knew where she was , but it looked different by daylight . The siren faded and was replaced by the general traffic sounds of New York . One blind was open and she could see the cab of a big truck as close as Benny was , and beyond it taxis weaving past . A dog barked intermittently . Benny turned and came over to her . He was holding out a big cardboard cup to her . " Chock Full 0 ' Nuts , " the cup read . Something seemed very strange about this . No one had ever given her anything in the morning-certainly not Mrs. Wheatley , who was never up before Beth had eaten her breakfast . She took the plastic top off and tasted the coffee . " Thanks , " she said . " Dress in the bedroom , " Benny said . " I need a shower . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a folding card table with a green and beige chessboard on it . He was arranging the pieces when she cane : into the living room . " Okay , " he said , " we 'll start with these . " I le handed her a roll of pamphlets and magazines wrapped with a rublwr h ; uid . On top was a small pamphlet with a cheap paper cover reading " The Hastings Christmas Chess Congress Malaise Hall , White  | Rock Gardens , " and under this , " A Record of Games . " The pages inside were dense with type , smudgily printed . There were two chess games on a page , with boldface captions : Luchenko-Uhlmann ; Borgov-Penrose . He handed her another , titled simply Grandmaster Chess . It was much like the Hastings booklet . Three of the magazines were from Germany , and one was from Russia . " We 'll play through the Hastings games , " Benny said . He went into the bedroom and came back with two plain wooden chairs , setting one on each side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still parked outside and the street was full of slow-moving cars . " You play the white pieces and I 'll play Black . " " I have n't had breakfast ... " " Eggs in the fridge , " Benny said . " We 'll play the Borgov games first . " " All of them ? " " He 'll be in Paris when you go . " She looked at the magazine in her hand and then over at the table by the window again , then at her watch . It was ten after eight . " I 'll have the eggs first , " she said . They got sandwiches from a deli for lunch and ate them over the board . Supper came from a Chinese take-out on First Avenue . Benny would not let her play quickly through the openings ; he stopped her whenever a move was at all obscure and asked her why she did it . He made her analyze everything out of the ordinary . Sometimes he would physically stop her hand from moving a piece to ask questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why is n't he defending against the rook ? " or " What 's going to become of the backward pawn ? " It was rigorous and intense , and he did not let up . She had been aware of such questions for years but had never allowed herself to pursue them with this kind of rigor . Often her mind would be racing with the attack possibilities inherent irl the posit ions that developed in front of her , wanting to push Luchenko or Mocking or Czerniak into lightning attacks against Borgov , when Benny stopped her with a question about defense or opening the light or dark squares or contesting a file with a rook . It infuriated her sometimes , yet she could see the rightness of his questions . She had been playing grandmaster games in her head from the time she first discovered Chess Review , but she had not been disciplined about it . She played them to exult in the win to feel the stab of excitement at a sacrifice or a flared mate , especially in the games that were printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - like the gave books by Fred Reinkld that were full of queen  | sacrifices and melodrama . She knew from her tournament experience that you could n't rely on your opponent setting himself up for a queen sacrifice or a surprise mate with knight and rook ; still , she treasured the thrill of games like that . It was what she loved in Morphy , not his routine games and certainly not his lost ones  --  and Morphy like everyone else had lost games . But she had always been bored by ordinary chess even when it was played by grandmasters , bored in the way that she was bored by Reuben Fine 's endgame analyses and the counteranalyses in places like Chess Review that pointed out errors in Reuben Fine . She had never done anything like what Benny was making her do now . The games she was playing were serious , workmanlike chess played by the best players in the world , and the amount of mental energy latent in each move was staggering . Yet the results were often monumentally dull and inconclusive . An enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawn move , say , opening up a long-range threat that could become manifest only in half a dozen moves ; but Black would foresee the threat and find the move that canceled it out , and the brilliancy would be aborted . It was frustrating and anticlimactic , yet  --  because Benny forced her to stop and see what was going on  --  fascinating . They kept it up for six days , leaving the apartment only when necessary and once , on Wednesday night , going to a movie . Benny did not own a TV , or a stereo ; his apartment was for eating , sleeping and chess . They played through the Hastings booklet and the Russian one , not missing a game except for the grandmaster draws . On Tuesday she got her lawyer in Kentucky on the phone and asked him to see if everything was all right at the house . She went to Benny 's branch of Chemical Bank and opened an account with the winner 's check from Ohio . It would take five days for it to clear . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenses until then . They did remarkably little talking during the first week . Nothing sexual happened . Beth had not forgotten about it , but she was too busy going over chess games . When they finished , sometimes at midnight , she would sit for a while on a pillow on the floor or take a walk to Second or Third Avenue and get an ice cream or a Hershey bar at a deli . She went into none of the bars , and she seldom stayed out long . New York could be grim and dangerous-looking at night , but that was n't the reason . She was too tired to do Inure than go back to the apartment , pump up her mattress and go to sleep .  | Sometimes being with Benny was like being with no one at all . For hours at a time he would be completely impersonal . Something in her responded to that , and she became impersonal and cool herself , communicating nothing but chess . But sometimes it would change . Once when she was studying an especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a draw , she saw something , followed it , and cried out , " Look at this , Benny ! " and started moving the pieces around . " He missed one . Black has this with the knight . . . " and she showed a way for the black player to win . And Benny , smiling broadly , came over to where she was sitting at the board and hugged her around the shoulders . Most of the time , chess was the only language between them . One afternoon when they had spent three or four hours on endgame analysis she said wearily , " Do n't you get bored sometimes ? " and he looked at her blankly . " What else is there ? " he said . They were doing rook and pawn endings when there was a knock at the door . Benny got up and opened it , and there were three people . One was a woman . Beth recognized one man from a Chess Review piece about him a few months before and the other looked familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking . She was about twenty-five , with black hair and a pale complexion , and she was wearing a very short gray skirt and some kind of military shirt with epaulets . " This is Beth Harmon , " Benny said . " Hilton Wexler , Grandmaster Arthur Levertov , and Jenny Baynes . " " Our new champ , " Levertov said , giving her a little bow . He was in his thirties and balding . " Hi , " Beth said . She stood up from the table . " Congratulations ! " Wexler said . " Benny needed a lesson in humility . " " I 'm already tops in humility , " Benny said . The woman held out her hand . " Nice to meet you . " It felt strange to Beth to have all these people in Benny 's small living room . It seemed as though she had lived half her life in this apartment with him , studying chess games , and it was outrageous for anyone else to be there . She had been in New York nine days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the board again . Wexler came over and stood at the other side . " Do you do prob-lems ? ?
