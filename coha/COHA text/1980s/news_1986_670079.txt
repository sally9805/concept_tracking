The nation ' s largest retail chains , hurt by warm late-September weather and hot auto sales , had modest sales gains last month . But in a mild countertrend , some retailers and manufacturers reported a tax- and housing-related surge in sales of big-ticket items , such as major appliances . Sales at stores open at least a year rose just 1. 1% at Sears , Roebuck &; Co. during September , but volume of some expensive lines was brisk ; growth in furniture sales , for instance , was " many times " that of Sears as a whole , the company said . Sears and others said such big-ticket gains from year-earlier figures were probably related to last spring ' s boom in housing sales , reflecting the normal lag time between a home sale and the need to furnish and equip the dwelling . " The houses that were started last spring are being completed , and they need appliances , " said Marvin D. Cope , product marketing manager for Maytag Co. , where unit volume matches the 10% gain notched so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A second factor : A few consumers , anticipating tax-law changes that reduce or eliminate deductions for sales taxes and most installment loans , may be buying large items early . " If it weren ' t for concern about taxes , the consumer would be fading more at this point , " said Michael Drury , an economist with A. Gary Shilling &; Co . , New York . Still , sales gains were moderate at most large retail companies . Sales at K mart Corp. stores open at least a year rose 5. 9% , while volume was up 6. 2% at J.C. Penney Co. and 5. 3% at May Department Stores Co. , which for the first time consolidated its sales with those of Associated Dry Goods Corp. , acquired this month . Sales plunged 3. 3% at Montgomery Ward &; Co. , the Mobil Corp. retailing unit , reflecting " discontinuation of certain unprofitable merchandise lines , " said Bernard F. Brennan , president and chief executive officer . Sales improved for only two of the company ' s five main groups of merchandise , electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak sales performance , Mr. Brennan said , " earnings improvements resulting from these merchandising decisions have been very favorable . " " We haven ' t seen this bullish economy that people have been talking about all year , and we still don ' t see it , " said Kenneth A. Macke , chairman and chief executive officer of Dayton Hudson Corp. , where comparable-store sales rose a moderate 5. 8% in September . Added Thomas Murasky , vice president and chief financial officer of K mart , " Business is softer than expected . " Unusually warm weather slowed sales of seasonal gear and clothing , such as coats , during the last two weeks of the five-week fiscal period , which ended Oct. 4 for most retailers . Temperatures averaged as much as 15 degrees above normal in parts of the country during the two-week period , said Jeffrey Feiner , retail analyst for Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith Inc . General merchandise volume was also undercut by the jump in auto sales caused by the auto makers ' low-interest financing incentives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly making car payments , and they won ' t have a lot left over to go shopping with , " said Sandra Shaber , chief consumer economist for Chase Econometrics . Still , most companies and analysts said they expect the moderate sales tone to persist through the end of the year . Most project fourth-quarter general merchandise sales rising about 6% , generally consistent with recent trends . " There are many cracks in the economy , but for consumer spending to flatten , you have to beat down the consumer with a stick , " said Edward A. Weller , analyst with E.F. Hutton &; Co . " Instead , what we ' ve had is weak , boring economic data , and the consumer has refused to lie down and die . " A more pessimistic Mr. Drury of A. Gary Shilling said he expects consumer spending to grow just 3% to 3. 5% during the next 12 months , with flat sales this Christmas . But Mr. Feiner of Merrill Lynch said retailers ' profits should improve during the holiday season . " Retailers continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminating the need for some markdowns at Christmas , he said . " We expect a favorable profit performance for most companies in the fourth quarter . " Appliance volume may continue brisk as well , industry officials said . Overall , major appliance shipments rose 15. 5% in August , the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said . " The confidence level of the consumer is stable enough for them to want to buy a big discretionary item , " said John A. Kammerer , senior vice president , marketing , for Amana Refrigeration Inc. , a Raytheon Co. unit . Amana ' s refrigerator sales rose 25% above normal in September , he said . Here ' s how some smaller retailers fared in September : Carson Pirie Scott &; Co. , sales up 17. 1% ; Payless Cashways Inc. , up 14% overall and 7% at stores open at least a year ; Jamesway Corp. , up 17% overall , 8% at comparable stores ; and Mars Stores Inc. , up 14. 3%.  --  - Table Five-week September period a- ' 86 sales ' 85 sales b-% millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 , 356. 0 2 , 329. 8 + 1. 1 K mart . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 , 061. 1 1 , 909. 9 + 7. 9 J.C.
