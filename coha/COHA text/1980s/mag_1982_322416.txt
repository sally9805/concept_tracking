Hawaii aims for energy self-sufficiency in the 21st century <P> The Arab oil embargo of 1973-74 gave Hawaii a frightening lesson in the vulnerability of its energy lifelines : the islands rely almost entirely on outside oil for fuel . Last year they used more than 45 million bbl. , or $1.5 billion worth , nearly two-thirds of it from foreign sources . " Hawaii is more dependent on imported oil than any other state , " says Kent Keith , deputy director of Hawaii 's department of planning and economic development . But Keith points out : " Our potential for energy self-sufficiency may also be greater than that of any other state . " In the past ten years Hawaii has channeled an astonishing $65 million into researching and developing such alternative energy sources as solar , wind and geothermal power , and making them commercially competitive with oil . A 1981 study by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy predicted that by the year 2005 , the state could be producing 90% of its electricity through renewable resources that are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Although lower oil prices resulting from the present petroglut , combined with the current recession and the Reagan Administration 's slashing of energy-research funds , have slowed Hawaii 's ambitious plans , these projects have not been stopped . Among them : <P> <P> &gt; Biomass , or organic material from plants and garbage , has provided the most encouraging results thus far . The burning of bagasse , the brownish fibrous residue from sugar cane , began in the early 1970s when the Environmental Protection Agency ordered a halt to the dumping of 2.7 million tons of cane waste per year into the Pacific Ocean . With a little help from the Government and a capital investment of some $25 million , planters discovered that a ton of bagasse produces the equivalent electricity of 1 bbl. of oil . Bagasse now provides 7% of Hawaii 's electricity needs . But the state is not relying entirely on the depressed sugar industry for biomass . It is now considering pineapple waste and macadamia nut shells as energy sources . Tree farms have been planted for future fuel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now being cultivated in Kauai , which can be harvested in four years and will produce in one acre the energy equivalent of 20 bbl. of oil . <P> <P> &gt; Geothermal power is readily available on Hawaii , the youngest and most volcanically active of the islands . In 1976 drillers dug the world 's hottest hole , with bottom temperatures of 676 F , on the eastern slopes of Kilauea volcano . Last year the well came on line with a $14 million , 3-megawatt* power plant , only the second such geothermal facility in the U.S. Estimates of the island 's geothermal potential range up to 3,000 megawatts , nearly twice the whole state 's present electric-power consumption . The further development of new geothermal sources would be spurred if engineers could design a cable to span the 26-mile , 7,000-ft. - deep Alenuihaha Channel between Hawaii and the other islands to permit the export of electricity . <P>
