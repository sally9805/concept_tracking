' ' I don ' t know whether Proust could talk ( well enough ) , ' ' says the bearded , blue-jeaned Leonard , chatting in his unmanicured town house on a manicured street on New York ' s chic East Side . He is describing the criteria for authors on ' ' First Edition ' ' ( PBS for 12 Thursdays , 8-8 : 30 p. m. , check local listings for premieres and repeats ) . // ' ' Look , ' ' he says earnestly , ' ' more than 40 , 000 books are published every year , many more good ones than the 12 or so I can feature on the program . It won ' t do the authors or the program any good if I get somebody on who is tongue-tied or pompous or shy . I must know in advance that the author is articulate , or there ' s no point in bothering. ' ' // Isn ' t there a certain ambivalence in doing a show about people who choose to communicate in writing - and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods his head sadly . ' ' Yes , it ' s ambivalent . . . . We are stuck with a compromise . But the fact is , there are writers who I admire greatly who I would never have on this program , because I know they can ' t talk well enough . Their appearance wouldn ' t do them any good. ' ' // The premiere show started airing last night in some areas ( about 50 stations have so far signed for the series , which is distributed on PBS through the Interregional Program Service ) . Featured is Norman Mailer , a supremely articulate author , who came on the show only because the hosts promised not to focus on his celebrity but on his writing . After a discussion during which he explains that his journalistic writing ' ' made me discover I had a sensibility that was my own , ' ' Mailer warns of the dangers of journalism : ' ' It encourages bad habits - the story is handed to you . ' ' He feels that ' ' Executioner ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite book , belongs on a different shelf from his other works . Then he reads from his latest novel , ' ' Real Men Don ' t Dance , ' ' as the camera moves in for revealing close-ups. // The format of the show then features an ' ' Uncommentary ' ' by the cantankerous Clifton Fadiman , who discusses the difference between the art of literary criticism and the business of book reviewing - making it clear that the reviewer serves only as a conduit between printer and public. // The final segment of the show will be ' ' In Review , ' ' a couple of book reviews by co-host Nancy Evans and John Leonard . In his review of ' ' Exile : The Unquiet Oblivion of Richard M. Nixon , ' ' by Robert Sam Anson , Mr. Leonard poses a fascinating question : ' ' Are we ready to forgive a man who doesn ' t understand what it is we feel a need to forgive ? ' ' // The second in the 12-part series features Elmore Leonard ( no relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' a writer of suspense thrillers , who has won the praise of critics for breaking the bounds of the crime genre . Future interviewees will include John Updike , Toni Morrison , Saul Bellow , Barbara Tuchman , Joe McGinnis , Paul Theroux , and Joseph Heller . Some are re-edited tapes from last year ' s Arts cable-TV show of the same name. // Host John Leonard - who is also TV critic for New York Magazine - edited the New York Times Book Review for many years . He was TV columnist for the old Life magazine , writing under the pseudonym Cyclops , and is very proud that during his stint there he called the shot on ' ' M*A*S*H ' ' as ' ' the most important regularly scheduled half-hour in TV history . ' ' Currently , he is working on his fifth novel , ' ' The Glee Club. ' ' // ' ' The point of the show , ' ' says Leonard , ' ' is to make people read books ' ' - and not to use the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we are falling short in not introducing many unknown writers ; we are interviewing too many big names . I hope , if we have another season , that we will have more new writers. ' ' // How about pop writers like Danielle Steele and Sidney Sheldon ? // Mr. Leonard shakes his head vigorously . ' ' We will not have that kind of writer ever . Those people already have publishers ' publicity machines working for them , access to ' Johnny Carson ' and other talk shows. ' ' // Is TV taking the place of books in many households ? // ' ' Not at all. // ' ' TV is a form of entertainment , and many books that used to be published were the same kind of entertainment , so there have been some substitutions . But it doesn ' t hurt at all . More people are writing now than ever wrote before . There are more high school newspapers , more underground magazines . I see no evidence whatsoever that a good book isn ' t being published because of television. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young people has substituted TV for reading Saul Bellow ? // ' ' No . It is probably true that a lot of people in college have a shorter attention span and want quicker payoffs from their entertainment packages . But these people weren ' t in college before . And maybe don ' t belong there now . Maybe we should worry about education rather than TV. ' ' // What would make ' ' First Edition ' ' a success , in the eyes of John Leonard ? // He thinks carefully , rubbing his beard . ' ' I want no writer on the program who wouldn ' t make my children better people , didn ' t tell me something I didn ' t know before , make me reexamine positions about life that I held before . But I want the books bought , too . Deep down I just want to sell different books from the books that are sold automatically now. // ' ' That ' s why there will be no jerks on the program , no politicians , no film stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to put words , paragraphs , pages , books , together. ' ' // A preview of the first few programs of ' ' First Edition ' ' finds plenty of famous writers , but no jerks , no politicians , and no film stars . And no newcomers . It is a welcome addition to the PBS schedule - featuring witty and provocative conversation , writers and critics who have something solid to say , and even an occasional droll piece of good wit. // If it ' s action adventure or mindless entertainment you ' re looking for , ' ' First Edition ' ' won ' t knock you out of your armchair . But it will provide viewers with stimulating , literate conversation about literary events . It ' s even worth putting down that book you ' re reading for a half-hour break. // //
