A Pentagon report raises questions about keeping the Marines in Lebanon <P> The report , prepared by a five-man commission appointed by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger , had been ready for nearly a week . <P> But the date set for its public release kept slipping . Press briefings were promised , then canceled . Finally , with no advance notice , President Reagan stepped into a largely empty White House briefing room and stole some of the report 's expected thunder . With his flak for drama , Reagan announced , " If there is to be blame , it properly rests here in this office and with this President . I accept responsibility for the bad as well as the good . " <P> Reagan 's declaration was meant to absolve officers in the operational chain of command who had been criticized for failing to take adequate precautions before a truck bomb killed 241 U.S. servicemen last Oct. 23 . The President also used his constitutional power as Commander in Chief of the armed forces to head off courts-martial for the officers . Said he : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already suffered quite enough . " <P> On one level , Reagan 's motives were plainly compassionate . " He felt that the process of trying to lay blame on individuals was demeaning to those who died and unnecessarily painful for the families , " explained a White House aide . " He did not wish to see the process dragged out . " Beyond that , Reagan has high regard for the military and apparently acted , in his view , to protect it . <P> At the same time , however , the White House knew that there were political advantages in diverting attention from the substance of the highly critical report . <P> " We were afraid that the Pentagon would get out front and dump on the mission , " said another presidential adviser , referring to anticipated criticism by the military of the Marines ' role in Lebanon . Nor did the political strategists relish the prospect of a series of attention-getting disciplinary hearings in an election year . <P> Yet the political gains may have been only temporary . Despite Reagan 's mea culpa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired Navy Admiral Robert L. J. Long , - will not be easily shrugged off . In effect , the report concluded that the Marines are engaged in a Mission Impossible . On one hand , they are unable to pose as neutral peace-keepers because the U.S. has sided militarily with the rickety central government of Amin Gemayel . On the other , they are too few in number ( 1,800 ) and too restricted in their operations ( never firing unless fired upon ) to be much of a military threat to the antigovernment factions . <P> Ranging somewhat fearlessly into political rather than strictly military matters , the report implicitly challenged the Administration 's decision to gamble so heavily on the Gemayel government . Noting that both President Gemayel and General Ibrahim Tannous , commander of the Lebanese armed forces , are Maronite Christians hated by other religious factions , the commission declared , " Whatever their true intentions may be concerning the future of Lebanon , they are caught in the same tangled web of distrust , misunderstanding , malevolence , conspiracy and betrayal that has brought Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
