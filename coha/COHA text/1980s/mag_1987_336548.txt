Should an economic power as large as the U.S. get excited about the sale of a few thousand autos or tons of steel to a foreign country ? Yes , indeed . For America in the 1980s , a modest export can represent a major industrial breakthrough . Cases in point : Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca announced in September that for the first time in nearly ten years , the automaker would begin selling U.S.-made autos in six West European countries  --  and at prices lower than those of competitive models . Earlier this year the largest U.S. steelmaker , USX , sold 20,000 tons of hot-rolled bands to an Osaka tube company at a price some 12% below what Japanese producers were offering . <P> Such successes might have been unthinkable only a few years ago , when the world tended to view many American products as singularly unattractive in quality and price . In retrospect it was no wonder , since U.S. industries were saddled with an overvalued dollar , vast payrolls , clanky factories and an overstuffed management . Yet in a relatively short span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed . Competitiveness has become a top economic priority , and an overworked buzzword , from Main Street to Capitol Hill . American companies have slimmed down and smartened up , while at the same time the 35% fall in the value of the dollar during the past two years has made U.S. products more affordable overseas . <P> In the nick of time too , because a bruising global battle has really just begun . As more countries become industrial powerhouses and their companies seek larger marketplaces , the U.S. will meet more and stronger competitors . Japan , the most potent of them all , is pushing into such American strongholds as biotechnology and supercomputers . Western Europe is coming up fast in aeronautics and office equipment . The newly industrialized countries are staking out their turf as low-cost producers of everything from steel to TV sets . And the U.S. may face a fresh competitive breeze from Canada as a result of the free-trade agreement the two countries reached on Oct. 4 . <P> U.S. export performance in the 1980s has been discouraging . Its share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , while most other industrial countries made gains . The share held by the least developed countries fell sharply , generally because of plunging world prices for commodities ranging from oil to rubber to tin . <P> America 's leadership in some industries is probably gone for good . The U.S. may never be able to make a significant comeback in mass-manufactured commodities , among them textiles , shoes , consumer electronics and machine tools . But the more complex the product , the more likely America can hold its edge . The U.S. is still strong in such products as semiconductors ( world market share : 40% ) , personal computers ( 68% ) and jet engines ( 90% ) . Moreover , the U.S. remains the leading force in health care , entertainment and financial services .
