Last week Kitty Dukakis interrupted her hectic campaign schedule to travel back to Boston for Yom Kippur , the holiest day in Judaism 's yearly calendar . There she joined 1,000 worshipers to participate in the age-old evening prayers of repentance in the modern sanctuary at Temple Israel , her Reform synagogue . Then , without making any public comment , she went home to quietly observe the traditional sundown-to-sundown fast . <P> The woman who could soon become the first Jewish First Lady naturally stirs pride within her religious community . But she also personifies American Judaism 's most vexing and divisive issue : intermarriage . When Kitty wed Michael Dukakis ( who is Greek Orthodox ) in a 1963 civil ceremony , she was part of a growing trend . During the past three decades , says Brooklyn College sociologist Egon Mayer , the incidence of intermarriage among Jewish young adults has nearly tripled . A study for the American Jewish Committee puts the rate at around 30% ; in Denver and Phoenix it runs to 60% . <P> Most faiths frown on mixed marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly severe violation of religious tradition . Since the Holocaust , America 's Jewish community of 5.9 million has become sensitized to its erosion through intermarriage and assimilation . Emotions run high . Rabbis who agree to officiate at interfaith marriages  --  and some 75% refuse  --  are sometimes viewed as traitors and spurned by synagogues . Parents and grandparents worry about the future of their families and faith . " They fear that ' 5,000 years of Jewish lineage is going to end with my child , ' " says Rabbi Robert Alper of Wyncote , Pa . <P> Officially , opposition to mixed marriage is one issue on which all wings of U.S. Judaism agree . But in practice there are distinctions . If the Gentile spouse converts to Judaism , as happens 30% of the time , the union is treated as one between Jews ; requirements for conversion are toughest among the Orthodox . In addition , Reform and Conservative congregations welcome unconverted Gentile spouses into temple life ; Orthodox synagogues are less accommodating . And while the Reform rabbinical conference in 1973 formally denounced the participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal of Judaism 's major branches generally do as they please . Reform Rabbi Irwin Fishbein of Westfield , N.J. , last year printed a national directory of 200 members of the Reform clergy who are willing to conduct intermarriages . Moment , a feisty Jewish monthly , caused a stir earlier this year when it estimated that half of Reform rabbis perform such ceremonies . <P> Most rabbis who are willing to help Jewish-Gentile couples demand certain conditions . Rabbi Robert Schreibman of suburban Chicago is typical : he performs mixed-marriage ceremonies only if the partners promise to rear their children as Jews . Rabbi Burton Padoll of Peabody , Mass. , exacts no promises , but will not preside jointly with a Christian minister or within a church . A handful of rabbis are untroubled by Christian involvement . Chicago 's Rabbi Howard Berman will conduct a ceremony if the partners simply agree to spend more than a year in his outreach program for the intermarried , one of the biggest in the Midwest .               @ @ @ @ @ @
