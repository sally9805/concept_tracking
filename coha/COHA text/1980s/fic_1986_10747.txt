jeweler in a nearby market town . But he seemed wary of Alv , watched him closely throughout the work , and squinted dubiously at the knife and axehead he had commanded . " Fine craft enough , laddie , fine enough , " he wheezed , turning them over in his fingers . " A trifle fancy , maybe . Truth be told , bestI 've seen from a younker so long 's I can recall . But  --  " He shook his head . " Where 's the feeling in ' em ? Where 's the virtue ? These 're just lumps o ' metal , there 's never a bit of life between ' em . " Roc gaped , and Alv sprang up from the hearthstone where he had slumped . " But . . . I did everything aright ! You saw , you heard  --  " " Aye ! " protested Roc , " and he 's made many a strong work before now " I do n't doubt it ! " shrugged Hjoran uncomfortably . " There 's something about those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tome . And no master in his right mind would 've taught you the thingsyou know ' less you showed more'n a trace of craft in you . But look , lad , ca n't you see for yourself ? " He wheezed and rumbled over to his shelves , and pulled down a neat but unimpressive axe . " Piece Marja made . I save it to show women can do well 's most men at this game . Truth is , it 's not that good beside yours , you 've got an uncommon hand  --  but there ! What 's the virtue in that ? " Alv rubbed his fingers over the fine markings in the steel , traced a flicker of light that seemed to be not all reflection . " To go where it 's aimed , as mine was  --  " Hjoran drew a line on his untidy workbench and let the axe fall lightly . It struck a hair 's breath from the line . He thrust a handleiii into Alv 's piece , and repeated the test . It fell three fingers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , laddie , " he muttered . " And do n't think I 'm not sorry . " " Listen here , Master Hjoran , " Roc spluttered indignantly , " almostthe last thing our master said to him was that he 'd made master 's work ! " Hjoran weighed the axehead sadly . " Do n't doubt that either , boy . And I do n't understand it anymore'n you . Smith do n't lose the power he 's born with ! Can use it badly , maybe not at all  --  specially 's he gets older  --  but lose it ? Like a fire going out ? No , never . But itp101makes no difference . Not a rich man , me , not like your big-town smiths . Ca n't afford an apprentice who 's only half a smith . Ca n't even set you your prentice pieces . " Alv had sunk back onto the hearthstone , his face the color of the ashes that coated the earth floor . " So what then must we do ? Approachone of the wealthier smiths ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your pains ! They get paid to take apprentices , boy , big sums too , and run ' em like a manufactory . They 'll take a talentless nothing if his folks pay well enough , there 's always odd jobs for them , but not a couple of wandering tinkersmiths  --  sorry , but that 's how they 'll see it ! " Hjoran looked at the young men , Alv with shoulders bowed by shock and despair , Roc huffing and fidgeting . " If you want my advice , though .. he began , after a moment . " Yes , Mastersmith ? " they chorused . " Well , you lads with your fair skins , you 've got a sothran look to you . You could do worse than head for the Southlands  --  not just south of here , the real rich Southlands , Great Suderney across the Marshlands , Kerbryhaine as they name it themselves . Not that I 've ever been there , but I have met a few traders who have , and they do say that they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and those who have pay it no heed . Think we 're a load of savages to go singing to our work . Well , I 've never seen any sothran smithcraft , to my ken , but I 'd be damned surprised if you with your touch could n't do a damn sight better . Teach ' em a thing or two , maybe make your fortune . " " That 's it ! " whooped Roc , springing into the air . " That 's it ! Thanks , good master , thanks a thousand times ! Alv , Alv , what say you ? Shall we go south , and see my people 's land ? You know I 've always wanted to ! " Alv looked up . He was pale of face , and there was a distant , remote look in his eyes , but he nodded willingly enough . " If that 's what you wish , Roc , I 'll go southward with you . " " Good ! Good ! " wheezed Hjoran , obviously glad to be quit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? Break new ground , yes , yes . . . Well , getting late in the day , eh ? You can give me a hand here in the forge today , sleep in my loft tonight  --  now Marja'sp102not there , hahaha !  --  and be on your way the morrow . Give you some grub to tide you over , hah ? And do n't hang your head so , laddie . Sure you 'll get it all back one day  --  and when you do , you just come back posthaste and see old Hjoran , hey ? And he 'll have you a master yourself before you can say solder , you 'll see ! Now  --  to work ! Let 's get this place cleaned up a bit ! " They took leave of Hjoran the next morning . He set them on the track south with directions to where it joined the High roads , and their wallets well stuffed with provisions for a week or more . Not slow to take advantage of his opportunities , he had worked them almost until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , when he had owed them nothing . Alv had been glad of the distraction , for the pains of hard labor had helped numb him to the blunter agony of emptiness , of loss . One after another all the things he had gained or hoped to gain had slipped from his grasp , and latest of all , it seemed , that single thing on which all his arrogance had been based , pedestal of the pillar that raised him above other men . And yet now , past the first sharp pain of discovery , free at last to brood , he found he could in some wise accept what had happened . He had misused his gift , he could use it no longer ; that seemed like a natural consequence . In betraying , in wounding , was it not also his own flesh he had wasted ? Roc , munching on a sausage , was full of ideas and speculations about the south , which he hardly remembered . His parents had been small traders to the Northlands ; he had been orphaned when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold off as a servant by the caravan 's survivors . But half of what he said seemed to pass Alv by , and finally Roc burst out , " Are n't you excited , damn you ? It was you who wanted to see the world ! It was you who wanted a chance to make your fortune  --  " Alv kicked at the weeds covering the gravelly face of the road . " Once , yes . But that 's not what I need now . " " What then ? The moon ? " " If I could find there what I need , maybe . " " What 's that , then ? And where will you find it ? " Alv shrugged , and Roc raised his eyes to the sky . On the second day they came to the High roads , and Alv , comingp103out of his daze , marveled at the wide expanse of metalled trackway that lay across the hills like some pale gray ribbon , until it seemed to lead right up into the clouds on the horizon . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly ragged and cracked , and the wheelruts had long ago grown deep enough to churn up the bed , with no attempt made to fill them in . Here and there were potholes , where the ground under the bed had subsided ; some were full of earth , and grass , fireweed and pale lilies grew in them undisturbed . Still , it was a good track for travelers on foot , and from thence their way south was swifter . But it was no easier , for though many great towns such as Saldenborg , Arlaby and Thuneborg lay alongside the roads , and there was much demand for good smithcraft in them , in these towns the guild 's hand was heaviest , and Alv and Roc found themselves treated as little better than tinkersmiths . They looked like them too , for their once-respectable garb had grown ragged and rough , and only Alv 's fair speech won them some consideration . Once in a while they would find some master or journeyman , less scrupulous or more needy , who would let them do petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were driven out with a curse , or the dogs set on them . Once when this happened , Roc turned on a mocking apprentice and felled him with a blow of his ham fist , and they were hard put to escape the town watch . That night , as many others , they spent like outlaws , sleeping rough among the scrub , and stealing a fox 's kill for their meal . And on the next day , as ever , they turned their steps onward to the south . In truth , they had no clearer idea than that where they were going , for if they knew little of the Northlands they knew nothing at all of the south , and there were few who could tell them what lay ahead . Not many northerners now bothered to go south , and it was still too early in the year for traders coming up from there . But they saw one thing , that the people themselves were changing ; their skins were lighter , their faces longer , and here and there were eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ingar . Alv spoke less and less , and there were nights when Roc suspected he had not slept at all . The towns were growing smaller and sparser again , and the land wilder . At last , after some days ' walking throughp104wholly empty country they came to a small , poor town with a strange name , Dunmarhas , in which many seemed to have pale skins like theirs  --  not that it made their welcome any warmer , for folk seemed deadly afraid of what came from beyond their walls , fair-spoken or no . But here at last simple smithcraft was valued , for the town smiths were poor craftsmen indeed and kept no rules of guild . In return for teaching them some simple skills the travelers could at least get food and a pallet by the hearth , and by then that seemed much to them . When they left Dunmarhas they found that they were leaving the mountains behind , the range curving away inland . As the land fell and flattened out before them , the weather grew wetter and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firs standing out proudly over a mass of aspens , junipers and other lesser trees . Dogwood , ferns and sedge bloomed by the road , daisies , lilies and columbines in its wide crevices , and willows hung over the many little brooks and rivers it crossed . Mists rose swiftly and hung dank about them , and clouds of insects made the noon hours a torment . The road ahead became a long , dead straight ribbon leadingtoward a horizon on which there was nothing  --  no rise , no fall , no wall or building , no feature taller than clumps of misshapen trees . The land became covered with tall grasses that hissed in the clammy breeze , and every so often gave way to expanses of soft green rushes . Mists and haze became more frequent , and the wind often brought them a tang of the sea Alv knew so well from his childhood . The rivers were fresh , though stained brown and sharptasting , but many of the stagnant pools were brackish , and the water that oozed into every footprint beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleeping on the hard road by night , for nowhere else was dry enough , and there was seldom clear moonlight to walk by . They had walked through this fenland for days , and their last food was all but gone , when , as dusk was falling and the mists were rolling across the roadbed , they saw the flicker of fires ahead . Alv seemed reluctant for company , but did not refuse Roc , who went stumping ahead at a great pace . As they came nearer they saw that the fires were dotted around a long train of wagons , forty or fifty at least , which had stopped beside an old ruined shell of a building ,  |p105the  first they had seen for some time . Some of the wagons were small two-wheeled tiltcarts drawn by a single horse , others heavy four-wheelers drawn by teams of horses or oxen ; a few even had trailers . Many men moved around the fires , a strong party indeed , and yet as the two travelers appeared out of the mist , shouts of alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with swords and bows . Nor did they lower their weapons when they saw they faced but two men , young and ragged at that , and as paleskinnedas themselves . Tense questions rained at them from all sides in a tongue that they recognized but could not summon up in the stress of the moment . It seemed that any minute one of those taut bowstrings would loose . Then a tall bearded man in a fur-trimmed robe and hat shouldered his way through the crowd , waving the people aside , shouting something . Four bowmen remained with him , and one or two other men in robes with drawn swords , but the rest dispersed warily . He himself drew no weapon , but stared doubtfully at these two strangers for many slow breaths before he spoke , in the northern tongue . " You wear our skins , but you do n't seem to know our speech . Would this then be yours ? " " It is that I grew up with , " Alv replied , " and my companion here from his youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Roc . " " And you are not ? " Alv shrugged . " I have not that honor , that I know of . A foundling I , raised a northerner and named Alv , that is all . Roc has forgotten most of your noble tongue in his long exile , and I know it only from books . " The bearded man smiled a smile as impenetrable as a stone battlement . " Well then , my fair-tongued foundling , my name is Kathel Kataihan , called the Honest , a dealer in things of small account and the elected leader of this paltry troop of peddlers you see before you . Are you come to sell , or buy , or how else may we oblige you ? " " A seat by your fire on this dank night , honest sir , " chimed in Roc , " and perhaps a trifle of supper , as it 's some hours since we dined . Nothing elaborate , you understand , for it would not agree with the digestion this late of an evening . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are only poor traders with the least of victuals , sufficient only to get us across this godforsaken land without actually starving . If you were calling on us at our simple homes , why then we 'd share our last crusts with you gladly , but as it is we dare spare no morsel or crumb for the sake of the loved ones we have with us . " " Ah , but how remiss of us not to explain ! " said Roc smoothly . " We are not the common beggars or riff-raff as you would find in such places , but honest men of craft and lore traveling to the Southlandsin search of other honest men who will appreciate our hardearnedskills , namely the working of metals ... " Kathel 's eyes widened , and one of the other men , short and baldheaded , lowered his sword . " You 're smiths ? Northern smiths ? Out of the far north ? " Roc repeated his tale about the unfortunate death of their master , and the short man rounded on Kathel and spoke a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill of repairing wheel and axle , " said Alv , in halting sothran phrases . " And of understanding our tongue , indeed , " said Kathel . " Can you make our carts whole ? " " I will not say till I see them , " said Alv drily . " I have my tools , but not the whole equipment of a forge . With no smithy to hand  --  " Kathel inclined his head at the ruin beyond . " This is a smithy , " he said , with an air of having arranged it on the spot . " Or it was . That 's why we stopped here . We 've been trying to get it back into order , but we know no more of the craft than any traveler picks up over the years . We have four carts crippled by this worthless road , barely dragged here in one piece , and another ten that might fail us before we even reach Dunmarhas  --  not that the best of their blasted smiths will avail us much . " Alv smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since we passed . Let us see the damage , then , and the forge , and I will do what I can . " " Wait a minute ! " protested Kathel . " We 've not fixed a price yet ! " " Fire , food , bed , " said Alv . " The rest we 'll settle later , depending on how much is to be done . We wo n't haggle. "  | " You trust us ? " cried Kathel , as if the idea offended him . " Of course , " chuckled Roc , " since you 're called the Honest . " " Oh dear , oh dear , " breathed the trader , " what is the worldcoming to , to be sure ? Well , come and have a squint at what 's todo , and then you may share what poor scraps we have . " The poor scraps turned out to be as sumptuous as anything they had tasted , and in quantities enough even for Roc . Alv ate little , but the prospect of work seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had finished , " you reckon you can do it , then ? " " The most of it , " said Alv , " if your men can get the smithy clear and working . Those ten damaged wheels only need a fastening and a new iron tire ; Roc can do them for you on his own , he 's a fine craftsman . " Roc sat up and stared at him , startled . " And those with the bent axles and spokes I can straighten and weld so they 'll bear you all the leagues you 'll travel this season  --  if you keep to the roads . But the two with broken hubs  --  well , I can patch them up to last thirty leagues , maybe , but no more . " The trader sighed gustily . " Two ? Ah well , that 's nothing , nothing at all . We always start with a few extra wagons for just this kind of chance , they carry the victuals we eat on the way , see ? So we can just shift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't afford to lose fourteen , no ! Take the cream of the profit off the trip . So it seems to me you lads 're a godsend , that 's it , a godsend . Finding you just where one always needs a smith , after the worst of the road . But devil a man can you bring with you , these days ! " He swigged at his ale , and gazed up at the shell of the building above . " Used to be a smith there always , a century or two back . A good place , y'see , for all it was a bit lonely , because there was so much traffic up and down the roads at all seasons , and things always coming adrift in the wilds as is their cursed way . So there was a whole huge hostelry here on the end of the Great Causeway , with a forge to serve it . Times changed , fewer came , the hostelry fell out of use , but the smithy remained . It lay unused from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years . The last one , he was still alive when my father passed this way on his first trip , so he told me . Would 've been , let me see , fifty , sixty years back . But hep108died , and nobody came to take his place . " He looked keenly at his guests . " Now there might be an opening for two young lads not afraid of a bit of hard work . Very glad to have a smith here again , all us honest trading men 'd be ! Plenty of work for you there , caravans passing back and forth all the summer  --  " " And the rest of the year nothing and nobody but the marshspooks ! " grunted Roc . " No thanks , worthy sir ! Too empty and too lonely for us , eh , Alv ? " But Alv was looking up at the bare old walls and rooftrees , still thick , still strong . A flicker of flame kindled within , where the old hearth must be , and one of the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , melancholy air , and even Kathel hummed along . They 're worn , my sturdy feet From the wandering day , From the wandering day ! They 're sore , my willing hands , From the hours of toil , From the hours of toil ! Yet I can not restNow the day is done ! " I do n't know , " Alv said quietly . " I do n't know ... " It aches , does my ardent heart , Till I know no more , Till I know no moreWhat I must do , how far to go To forget my love , To forget my love ! But he said no more about it . Kathel grew sentimental with the song , snuffled into his ale , and then abruptly turned businesslike and led them all off to supervise the fitting-up of the forge . Roc bustled about , showing the workers how to fit a new leather to the corroded old bellows , but Kathel and Alv stood and looked around the ancient building . " Good strong walls ! " said the trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in in a day , my boys could ! Take some timber off the spare wagons , that and a few good solid strips of turfd make you a grand roof . You want food , you 've got rivers full of fish , birds all over the place , and all the dainties you like from your customers . And you need n't stint yourself ! With never a rival within thirty leagues , south or north , you could charge what you liked  --  ' cept to your worthy old friend Kathel , to be sure . You could make your fortune ! " Alv smiled , but said nothing , and that night once more he lay awake . But next day he betrayed no fatigue , nor gave away anything of what was in his heart , but labored with a will . From dawn till dusk of a dank , drizzly day he sweated over the rebuilt forge , straighteningwheels and axles , banishing the deadly hair-thin cracks and distortions that could overturn a whole valuable load in the middle of a ford or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but all marveled at his strength and perseverance , Kathel most loudly of all . Only Roc , engaged in welding minutely measured hoops of iron and setting them over the wooden wheels , would occasionally stop and look at him with a blend of anger , confusion and concern . But it was only late that night , when the labor was done at last , and they all retreated silently to their pallets and rugs , that Alv at last spoke . " Roc , my friend , " he said , staring into his mug of mulled wine , " I believe Kathel has the right of it . " Roc spluttered , but Alv held up a commanding hand . " There is a place for a smith here , a useful , a  --  a vital place , and here I mean to remain , for a few years at least . " " You 've not been taken in listening to that silver-tongued bastard , have you ? " burst out Roc . " You 're sick in your head , d' you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my head , " agreed Alv bleakly . " And in my heart , my hand and all of me that can feel . I have grown crooked , and I must be set straight . And if I mistake it not , this is the place set aside for my cure , and no other . " " Ach , Amicac have your sickly fancies ! This place'Il only feed them  --  or cure you of them and all else beside ! You should hear some of the tales I 've been hearing from the lads about these thrice/damned boglands  --  a brimful breeding ground for sicknesses , and worse ! Every marsh-fever and bog-ague known to man , here for the finding , to rot your innards and pain your bones and set your blood to boiling . And if that 's not enough , they 're awash with spooks and specters and nightwalkers and fearful things wandered downriver off the Ice , they are ! " " Men have lived here before , nonetheless , " said Alv calmly . " It is driest by the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Time enough ! " growled Roc . " Ah , see sense , Alv ! Or if not , leave the maggots in your mind and try thinking of me  --  for a change ! That you said about me last night , me being a fine craftsman , you 've never thought to say a single word of that before now " Because I never realized it mattered to you ; your feelings are not so easy to read . Do n't ever think I do n't know how much I owe you , Roc  --  and I am thinking of you now . If it 's true what Hjoran said , and from these folk it seems to be , that in the south the power of true smithcraft is unknown , then to them you will be as good a smith as I  --  " " You know that 's not true , " Roc growled , lowering his round head , " power or no power , you 've ten times my craft  --  " " You had to learn it to serve us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in the south you can , on your own account , and need be forgehand and servant no longer  --  " " Ach , the bog 's rotting your brain already ! If that 's so , it 's true ten times over for you . Do you come too , and be a master , an apprentice no longer ! Sink these shadows of yours in the mud like the dung they are . What 's done 's done . If I blamed you I 'd never have helped you out then  --  left you to our dear master 's mercy , I would , and cheerfully ! He was striving all he could to turn you down his path , because he needed your power  --  even I could see that , and who were you to resist , the age you were ? It 's him I blame  --  what you did , you did in his shadow , that 's all . " Alv nodded grimly . " Yes . And his shadow is with me yet . Roc , my friend , when Kathel sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I will not be coming with you . Not yet . " " Then to the River with you ! " spat Roc , and turned his back , and spoke no word more that night.  |p111He  said nothing , too , when the next day dawned , bright and blustery , and made his preparations in silence . Kathel was volubly surprised at the two friends ' parting , and all the more that Roc should blame him for it ; as a kind of expiation he presented him with a fair sum of money and a wealth of good advice and useful names , to get himself started in his trade . Roc , no fool , took both , but reluctantly . At last he swung himself up on one of the carts , whose driver he had already made a friend , and did not look back as the carts clopped and creaked away . A few hundred paces beyond the ruined smithy the High road left the dry land and set out across the marsh on the low wide arches of the Great Causeway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islets of solid ground , the road stretched far into the misty distance . Two broad pillars , weathered into shapelessness , marked the place , and beside one of those pillars Alv was waiting . " Well ? " said Roc coldly . " No , " Alv answered . " But fare you well , my friend . I can never repay you for all the trouble I have given you , all the good you 've done me  --  but I hope I may at least try , some day . " He held out his hand , and Roc reached down and shook it , once . But all he said was , " We wo n't be traveling fast . If you change your mind today , you 'll catch us up easily enough . Run 'll do you good . " Alv chuckled , and raised his hand . He made no move to follow as the cart creaked and ground out onto the road , but he stood and watched until it vanished into the sunlit haze . Behind him came the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shell of the old smithy habitable . The other merchants had joined with Kathel in making him all kinds of extravagantpromises , not realizing that it was not profit that tempted him to remain here . Far from it . Before  --  if ever  --  his life became his own again , he had a heavy debt to repay . That day he labored on the smithy with Kathel 's men , and sat late into the night under its new-made roof , talking with the merchantsabout the state of the world and drinking their mulled wine . It seemed that the world grew ever darker , roads longer and weather worse , customers stingier and tolls more rapacious . But under the light habitual complaints Alv found a note of real disquiet . The Northlands were sorely changed from Kathel 's youth , and he wasp112only middle-aged now . Then the Ekwesh were only a minor menace , harrying the far north from time to time ; native corsairs and outlaws were far more to be feared , and the independent towns stood in powerful federation to protect their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer fringes of the federation were in frightened disarray , the towns retreating behind their own walls and failing to answer the general call , and in this disarray the Ekwesh grew bolder than ever , and fared further south . " A dark time for honest traders , indeed , " sighed Kathel . " True that we prosper , and yet that is in part because so many rivals have failed or no longer care to risk the long journey north . So though business is much lessened , it does not have to stretch so far , and often buyers must take what we have at our prices , or go without . But that is an advantage I would gladly forgo , seeing the cause ; it will work ill in time . Still , there will be many caravans yet this summer , lad , and work aplenty to feed your forge  --  even if it must burn peats and not fine coal . You will do well enough here . And now to bed , for we must set off early to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his door , watching the long line of carts and wagons go trundling off up the road , the oxen stolid as ever but the horses whinnying and frisky , as if glad to be escaping the marsh . It was a long time before they faded into the distance , and longer yet before the noise of wheels and creaking wood and the voices of men and beasts was wholly lost to the ear . But when it was , a great silence seemed to descend , as cool and gray as the sky . Alv closed his eyes , and leaned against the huge heap of peat they had cut him , smelling its rich earthy scent . Around him the voices of the fens seemed to grow louder , the chatter of running water , the bubbling and gurgling from the stagnant pools and the hoarse croaking of the things that lived in them , the thin whine of insects and distant , mournful bird cries . There was little of warmth or comfort for human ears in those cold voices , but for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a promise , at least , of peace . He felt utterly alone . After a while he turned and went into the house  --  if house it was , for there was only one room roofed , the forge itself . It was little better than a shack , but the roof was solid and the old frontp113door of ironbound oak still strong ; he would set more iron around its rotten edges , and remake the rusted hinges , till it could have defended a fort . Walls , roof , door and a warm bed on the brick ledge by the forge  --  he needed no better . He busied himself arrangingthe great heap of provisions they had left him , enough by themselves for a month or more . He had hooks and line here , too ; later he would go fishing , and find dead wood to dry as kindling for the peat . He need look no further ahead than that ; let the future dispose itself as it would . But even as he thought that , the face of Kara arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and completely bereft . So began his life in the tumbledown smithy on the saltmarshes , and a lonely life it was to be . Over the remaining months of that first summer he lived by tending to the travelers who passed that way , usually in caravans  --  shoeing their horses , making new knives and weapons to replace those lost or broken , repairing their harness and their trade goods , their wagons and carts and occasionally the carriage of a more important traveler . He did his work well , for it had no call for any power in it , and he could have been very well paid . But most often he took his fee in metal , the stuff of his trade , or food , of which all who journeyed through the Marshlands carried a good surplus against emergencies ; he supplemented what he had with catching fish and trapping birds  --  or shooting them , when he found enough sound wood to make himself a bow and arrows . For the most part it was a meager living , for travelers were rarer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he feared the coming of winter , when none at all would pass ; he knew he had to hoard his small store against it , and smoked his catches over the forge , or preserved them in salt he made from the pools . He might have fared better by taking advantage of those who needed his help most , as Kathel had suggested , but that went against his nature . So his existence was harsh , harsher even than his childhood , and he had had many years of good living since then . And the marshes themselves made it harsher still , for they were a dank and sinister place indeed . In the heat of high summer they seemed hotter than his forgefire , hazy , fly-ridden and fetid ; strange fish stirred sluggishly in the lukewarm pools , and foul gases rose from the quaking mud.  |p114The  tall grasses yellowed and wilted , and dangerous bogs took on a thin deceptive crust to tempt the unwary foot too far . The road shone mirrorlike under a rippling curtain of air , and in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visions , from and into nothing . But for all this , as summer drew into autumn and travelers became rarer still , Alv began to range further and further afield among the marshes . He seldom worried about missing a traveler , for in that flat country his sharp sight could make out anyone approaching along the hummocked crest of the road a longway off . At first he went in search of better places to fish and hunt , and these he found . But also he had not forgotten the lore of metals he had learned , and knew that strange stones of good iron could be found in such huge marshes , though none knew why or how they came there . It was in searching for these , with a crude rake he had made , that he found the place he named the Battle Lands . It was a wide space of the marshes which began some two leagues away near the first island on the Causeway ; he never found where it ended , for it seemed to span the whole heart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazardous a heart as that fell place would have , all overgrown with thick clusters of black rushes whose stiff spear-tipped leaves could leave deep stab wounds in leg or questing hand . Worse , the whole area was spotted with broad shallowdepressions , up to a hundred paces or so wide . These seemed to mark the path of some watercourse far below ground , for they were brimful of mud that was always liquid and sucked down what fell into it like the maw of a giant . And they were not constant , butwould change from week to week , as if the water were seeking new courses under what had once been solid ground . Alv found them first by falling through a thin skin of rotting vegetation , and only pulled himself free with his rake . But when he had rested a little he thought the pit a likely place for iron , and raked as far as he could reach . He was surprised when at the first pass the tines hooked something that could not possibly be an ironstone . But it felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-decayed root or branch . So he was even more startled to see before him the blackened remains of a breastplate with corroded rags and tags of chain mail still attached to it , and of no type or style he knew . There was enoughp115metal left to be valuable , so he took it and thought little more of it , until some hundreds of paces further on , in more solid mud , he pulled up a clump of colorful marsh samphire to pickle and found an arrowhead tangled among its roots , and after that the peak of an iron helmet , again of no kind he knew . He raked another pit , and came up with yet more armor , but to his horror there was part of a body yet inside it , a headless trunk , withered but tanned brown and preserved by the marsh . He let it fall then , and left that place , but he soon conquered his loathing of it enough to return , for the whole land was a treasure trove of metal . Some immense battle had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedies besides , and the ceaseless ferment of the bog brought many sad remnants back to the daylight . Once he came upon a whole wagon standing proud of the mud , with rags of its hide cover clinging to the metal hoops , and tackle dangling stiffly from its front . And when he waded cautiously out to it over the half-hardened ground , he found in the mud inside those it had carried , the bodies , still recognizable , of a man , a woman , two children ; their hair gleamed golden in the slime , though their clothes had rotted to shreds . One of the man 's hands yet grasped at a length of hide cord , which had surely been reins , but the other clasped at the fragments of an arrow in his chest . " You were fleeing , " said Alv aloud to the dark dead faces . " Who knows what from , or why ? But they shot you , man , and your cart ran off into the marsh . And they cut your team free , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He felt his eyes prickle , and with a sudden surge of revulsion he ducked down , put his back to the rotting wood and with a single fearful heave tipped it out and over into the still liquid heart of the pit . The upturned wagon sank slowly from sight , its burden hidden beneath . " Sleep again , " he said harshly , as the blood-red grass flowers hissed in the wind . " Sleep , and forget . There is injustice enough walks free and alive in the light of day . " As autumn drew on , and darkness closed around the day , the marsh became yet more terrible for him . Rains pounded the land , washing what had been firm paths into treacherous slideways to the dark pools . The song sparrows and mockingbirds fell silent , and thep116sad notes of plover and sandpiper , the harsh croaks of rails and faraway screams of seabirds echoed across the flat land . The mists came rolling in off the distant sea till only the scant treetops could be seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows grew weird and treacherous . Some seemed to walk by themselves , strange thin forms stalking beside him or behind him , whichever way he turned . At night eerie cries echoed under the black obscuring clouds , pallid lights danced in the shadows beside the Causeway , and sleet and moaning wind battered at his door like great hands knocking . He kept it well barred , and seldom stirred outside . When once he did , on a night that was crisp and clear , he saw an immenselytall figure , glimmering gray in the starlight , go gliding across the frosty grasses like smoke in a breeze . He stood rock-still till it had passed , then backed slowly inside , softly shut and barred the door and sank down behind it , shaking . Not long after that , as autumn merged into a black , biting winter , he was just settling down for the night when he heard the unmistakableclop and rumble of a caravan approaching from the north . Wearily he went to the door and watched its lanterns advancing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a carriage . He was glad when its troubles turned out to be even smaller  --  a single sheared axle-pin on the lead wagon , which he was able to replace from his prepared stock , filing and beating it to a solid fit with a few minutes ' labor . He turned to store away the fine slab of bacon and pitcher of wine that were his fee , ignoring the caravan as it rumbled off . But he glanced up at the carriage as it came toward him . At the half-open window a slender arm rested ; its long sleeve fluttered aside , and in its shadow he glimpsed the serpentine shape of his armring . What that girl has , Louhi has .. . He stood in desperate confusion . If that was Kara  --  but if it was Louhi . . . And Louhi might well be there also  --  heading south  --  why ? He remembered what Ingar had called her  --  a schemer , a troublemaker  --  a great lady out of the Southlands , probably . . . Was she returning there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck to see , and made out another indistinct shape inside . He could dimly distinguish the face of the woman at the window ,  |p117wreathed  in something light-hued  --  but whether that was blond hair or a white hood , he could not tell . The woman did not see him ; she seemed to be looking straight ahead , toward the Causeway . He had only to call out . . . And risk an encounter with Louhi . That might be almost as perilous as meeting the Mastersmith . Doubt held him a crucial moment , and the carriage rumbled by . And as it passed he saw the dim face turn ; whoever she was , she was glancing down at him but without any sign of recognition . He stood , frozen , realizing only then how great were the changes that wanderings and labor and hardship had wrought in him , and the shame of them rose like bile in his throat . He felt then that even if it was Kara , he dared not move or speak to acknowledge himself , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . But as it passed her gaze seemed to linger on him , and as the carriage reached the Causeway he heard the window slam down , saw the white-wreathed head half lean out and look back . In a spasm of anguish he turned away as if uninterested , cursing himself for every kind of coward . He did not look again till the grind of the wheels had dwindled into the distance , and the caravan was fading like a dream beneath the livid face of the rising moon . Then he walked stiff-legged back into themean forge , and collapsed onto his bed . That midnight Alv awoke bathed in sweat , though the fire was low , and racked with sudden shivers . When he tried to stand , it was as if the marsh had run under the floor , and quaked . His bones ached , his teeth chattered , and before long his lungs seemed on fire . When he looked down at his hand the firelight seemed to shine right through it , as if he was fading away . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he laid food to hand , and an infusion he had made from the hark of a certain tree which he had learned was a specific against some fevers . It was this , perhaps , that brought him over the worst of his illness , but it lasted many weeks and all but killed him . At times he lay raving beside the dying fire , seeing faces arise to haunt him in its lambent flames . The dead of Asenby came shimmering around him with the Headman and Hervar , all blackened , leading them , showing off their wounds with malign pride ; the family from the wagon gathered around his bed , staring at him with wide shriveled eyes , and Kara moved amongp118them , let fall her cloak to show herself as naked and withered as they . And in the corners of the forge , now here , now there , calmly surveying it all , stood the bulky frame of Ingar ; as Kara appeared he threw back his head in a hearty laugh , and as he laughed he slowly , very slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whitehot silver run down his cheeks , but they were only tears . Mercifully he grew lucid long enough to feed the fire before it died , and once to rekindle it when it had , though he was very weak and had to crawl . At times he choked down a draft of the bitter drug , and sometimes even a morsel of food when his stomach did not revolt . So he lived , and one night before the turn of the year the fever broke , though the morning found him almost too weak to move . The worst of winter was not yet upon him , and though it sorely taxed him and he had barely enough food , by degrees his health returned . Cocooned in his blankets , he huddled in the smoky darkness while the winds howled outside and the silent snow fell , and grew used to his misery , and patient under it , and awaited its ending in peace . And one morning , though the marshes still gleamed with ice , and snow clung to the flanks of the Causeway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn air , and find in it a taste and promise of spring . He breathed deeply , and spread his arms wide , and found room in his mind and heart for nothing but sheer delight at being alive . It was as if in those hours of illness he had at last faced what tormented him and met its agonizing price ; the fever-flame had burnt it out of him . He could still suffer for what he had done , feel a chill shiver of horror and regret , but it had faded now into a memory , no more . He was cured of more than his sickness . The sun arose in glory , reborn from the old year that was gone . " And I also am reborn , " he thought , " here all alone . Am I still the boy they called Alv ? Surely not . That was never his name . Better to be a nameless , lonely smith of the saltmarshes  --  one alone , but one made whole ... " And then he remembered the lines from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found when he made the helm , and among them the one that had two meanings . Elof , one alone ; Elof , the smith.  |p119So  that is my name ! he thought , as if he had known it all along . Elof , who had been Alv , sat there in the sunlight for as long as it lasted , and moved little , for he was in truth like a newborn infant ; all his great strength had deserted him , and it was slow to return . But he was patient , and ate as much as he wished of his provisions , knowing that he would soon be fit to hunt and forage again , and that before long the caravans would be rolling along the roads once more . The first of them came southward only a week or two later , and he greeted it with joy , for it was Kathel 's returning , having overwintered in the north . The trader was equally pleased to find him . " Look at this ! Thirty wagons dragging , out of forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the dirt holding them together , and that 's what your misbegotten bitches of northern roads are doing to an honest man 's profits ! Well , Alv , how fare you ? Thinner but happier , by the face on you  --  " " I 've been ill , but I 'm better . And by the by , my name 's Elof  --  " " Ahab ! " thundered Kathel exultantly , leering and tapping a finger to the side of his red-veined nose . " So you were being close , then , and not giving me your right one , and did n't I always say it , Master Ourhens ? " He nudged the small bald man violently in the ribs . " Did n't I ? Alv , no name for a man , that , I said . Changeling indeed ! Well , far be it from me to blame a lad for being careful at first , far be it . Let 's have a drink on it ! " Elof let him assume that was how it was , because changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had enough of that with his carts . It took nearly four days to work all the repairs , and Kathel in gratitude left him so much food it almost filled the little space in the forge . And as his caravan filed away southward , with many shouted promises to return northward next spring , if they could , Elof suddenly felt he would welcome that , even with the prospect of another winter in between . For all their strangeness , for all the frost that still lingered late into the mornings and the storms of driving sleet and rain that came rolling in from the distant sea , the marshes were becoming a home to him , almost a shelter from the bitter demands of the world . Here he need worry onlyp120about himself , and that not so much now . They were a peaceful place as spring drew nearer , and even the echoes of ancient strife seemed to ring less loudly among the unheeding chatter of the birds . But later that day they rang out once again , for as he went searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replenish his dwindled stock of hoop tires and horseshoes , he came upon a whole heap of corpses thrown up by the flooding after the thaw . Most of them were fragmented past recognition , but one huge form lay whole , face down and a little apart from the rest , half out of the mud as if he were even now trying to escape . He seemed to be wearing black ringmail , which Elof had always found too corroded to reforge . This looked better than usual , but as Elof waded out unsteadily to examine it he saw something gleaming in the mailed hand still clutched by the mud . Gently he reached down and parted the stiff fingers  --  and saw the sword hilt they grasped crumble to fragments in that instant . Below it something black went slithering back down into the mud ; he grabbed it  --  then yelped with surprise and pain . But he held his grip , and with great difficulty managed to pull it free , and wiped it clean on the grass . It was the blade the hilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cut deeply into his palms . Forgetting his pain , he whistled with admiration , holding the dark metal up to the sun and seeing drops of his blood run gleaming down the rim . " And what smith of old made you , my beauty , that you 've still such a cutting temper , eh ? I 'd have liked to meet him , and tell him you 're every bit as sound and as sharp as the day he made you . And find out how ! " he added , with a deep sigh of envy . He held it by the tang , weighed it , balanced it , flexed it and finally swept it up in a great arc , lopping the heads from the nodding grasses . And that put a thought in his mind , and he looked over to the pile of cloven corpses , and nodded thoughtfully . It was hard to number them , but there might have been thirty or more . He whistled again , looked down at the dark shape , and made to turn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wielded such a weapon and to such effect . But the very movement and the touch of his hand disturbed a delicate balance . With a soft whispering sound the mail-clad figure slid back down into the mud , and was instantly sucked down . Only the mailed hand stood upraised anp121instant , then it was gone in a swirl of bubbles . For two breaths Elof stood there astonished , and then he raised the dark blade to his forehead in silent salute . He took the blade home with him , and he worked long into the stormy night , crafting the best hilt he could for it . He longed to make one worthy of such a weapon , if only to be about something more demanding than cartwright 's or farrier 's work . But how could he , maimed in spirit as he was ? He sighed , like the wind in the old stone chimney . It was not only fine materials he lacked , but the power to make anything worthwhile of them . So he toiled at reducingand reforging scraps of the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not only with the weariness of the labor . But as he worked , watching the flames dance to the singing wind , he found a rhythm and a harmony that gradually became a tune he could hum , a theme as sweeping and spacious as the fens that gave it birth , noble in tone but with a darker , sadder undertone . It seemed to reflect the origins of the sword only too well , and in the end the hilt he made pleased him . Its bold shape suited the straight sweep of the blade to perfection , and for the grip he had found a coil of silvered wire he could weave into a fine pattern . Most important of all , though , he had calculated the weight exactly against the blade 's ; the new-made sword balanced beautifully in the hand . It was the first fair thing his hands had shaped for many a day . When he had flattened and fined the last rivets holding it to the tang he set it on the anvil and sat for a long time gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent chasing across the tight coils of the grip , as if he had somehow put the wide fenland skies into his work . Or was it only the firelight ? He turned it this way and that , hunting the faintest glimmers like minnows in the pools , refusing to admit even the faintest cool chill of hope . He paid little heed to the new song of the wind , rising in a gusty urgent howl across the marsh , pressing the fire down like an unseen hand and setting the door rattling . At last , when the best of the night was past , he thought reluctantly of his bed . But even as he rose and left his anvil , the door shook violently with a sound that was not the wind , a thunderous knocking and a gruff voice shouting.  | " Come out ! Come out , you smith of the saltmarsh , and shoe me my horse ! Day is near , and I must be on my way ! " For an instant Elof stood shocked and indecisive , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather around him . But then he took hold of his courage . He had no choice . Why was he here at all , after all , if not to help somebody in trouble on such a night ? But he snatched the sword up from the anvil before he strode to the door . He slid back the bar , opened it a little  --  and an instant later , in a sudden gust of terror , he all but slammed it shut . On the road outside , its breath steaming in the wind , stood a horse of immense size , a very warhorse , and the stately rider in its saddle matched it well , for he seemed taller than mortal man could be . He was muffled up in a dark cloak , but at his back he bore a long , pointed black shield , and he was sliding a long spear back into its saddlerest ; its butt had left its mark on the door . Then he swung himself down , and as he did so the cloak parted , metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor beneath . But even as Elof 's hand tensed on the door , a hot onrush of contemptuous anger drowned his fright . What good would skulking behind a door do ? Let this be the warrior from the pit himself arisen , he was n't going to show he was even remotely afraid . He hefted his new sword , and swung the door wide . And as the newcomer stepped forward , Elof saw that he wore a breastplate as brightly black as a moonlight lake , wholly unlike that strange dark ring mail . At his side swung a great broadsword in a scabbard of the same hue , and he threw back his hood to reveal a high black helm . The visor made shadowy pits of the eyes , but beneath it the pale-skinned face was imperious , a great eagle nose and a bushy gray-black beard revealing thin hard lips set in a strange ironic smile . Behind him the great horse whinnied impatiently and pounded the road , and slowly Elof lowered his sword . " Where to , at such an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visor , the tall man looked Elof up and down before he spoke , and his voice was deep and stern . " This last night I was in Nordeney , and before the day breaks I must be in the Southlands . " A distance , all in all , of some thirty or forty leagues , at the veryp123least . Elof stared , and barely repressed a chuckle . " Well , I 'd gladly believe that , if you had wings  --  " The tall man 's gaze did not falter , nor the twist of his lips , but it looked less like a smile . " If the wind may , so also this horse of mine . " He lifted his head and gazed around the sky . " But even now the stars grow paler ! So out with your shoe , smith , and be quick about it ! " Elof stiffened in anger , but the madman was right , he was wasting time . The sooner he was shot of him , the better . He shrugged contemptuously , hooked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseshoes he had made , looked dubiously at the great brute outside , and set the largest to heat , working the bellows till it glowed . The tall man turned without another word , and backed the horse up before the smithy door . Putting his shoulder to the great beast 's rump , Elof seized its leg and bent it up against his knee . Its weight seemed immense , the play of the muscles hard and taut  --  a real warhorse , worthy to bear this armored giant of a man . But it submitted calmly as he checked that the old shoe had been cast cleanly , leaving no nails behind in the massive hoof , and that no dirt had fouled the site . Then he reached out for the pincers and seized the shoe out of the fire with the air rippling about it . But as he brought it to the hoof to try it , he saw with dismay that it was narrower by a third at least than the huge hoof must have . And he had no suitable metal to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held it up to show the rider , who gazed down at it impassively . " It 's too small  --  " began Elof , but he stopped , choking with disbelief . The heated air rippling about the red-hot shoe distorted it like a deforming mirror , thicker and thinner by turns , until it almost seemed to be flexing  --  swelling  --  stretching itself out .. . Unable to credit what he saw , Elof brought the shoe down against the hoof . A cloud of smoke hissed upward , though the huge horse did not stir . And when the smoke cleared , Elof found himself looking at a perfectly fitted shoe . The wind howled through the open door , the forgefire juddered and shrank away , and Elof felt the hairs on his neck bristle . Without looking up , he snatched up the hammer and nails laid ready and ,  |p124doing  his best to ignore the icy shivers in his back and his guts , he quickly and expertly nailed the shoe firm . Letting the leg fall , avoiding the stranger 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim needed , but a plate and mail gauntlet closed ice-cold upon his bared arm . He had to look up , and saw the stranger shake his head . The warhorse neighed and stamped like thunder , and the huge man sprang to the saddle , his sword ringing at his side . " Fit for the steed of a god . And now good night to you  --  Master Elof ! " " I 'm no master ! " said Elof between his teeth , and then , because the smile grew positively malicious , and he felt he was being toyedwith , he shouted above the rising wind , " What did you do , damn you ? " The tall man laughed , like high surf breaking on gravelstone . " I ? Nothing . All that was done , you did . But there 's light in the east , and battle bids me haste  --  here 's your fee , Master Smith ! " The gauntleted hand swept out from behind the cloak , and a thick disk of silver was tossed to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or oil  --  very slowly , but with a dizzying spin that held his gaze fixed . He reached out for it , leaped up , his fingers closed around it  --  and something black rushed between and snatched it . He tumbled in the mud with a jarring , derisive croak ringing in his ear . Two huge ravens stooped over him , squabbling over the coin one held in its beak , then they wheeled up and after the horse as it sprang away and went thundering down the road toward the Causeway . Elof , dizzy and lightheaded , sprang up and stormed after it , shouting he knew not what crazy insults into the teeth of the wind . But the great charger did not gallop out onto the Causeway , but sprang lightly down the slope beside it and out into the marsh . And Elof , mad as he was with the ravens mocking overhead , leaped after it . The strange steed sprang away , over land , over marsh , over sheets of open water , seeming to gallop effortlessly on , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him , and seemed to bear him along in great bounds , till he hardly knew whether his feet touched ground or ran in the empty air . Ahead of him now the ravens rode it and flew faster still , but they could not catch upp125with the rider . A great light shone around the black helm , and the dark gray cloak streamed out behind him , flapping and spreading in the wind of his passage until it seemed to fill the whole sky around him , and blot out all the light , until suddenly he was running in blackness , and came to a hesitant halt , swaying and panting . How long he had been running , or where to , he had no idea , though he felt only a little out of breath . Surely dawn could n't be far off .. . He took a hesitant step forward , heard a slight splash , and swore as he felt chilling water running around his ankles . Then he looked up , and the blackness had turned to gray , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly around him . It was the familiar fenland he saw , with wisps of mist drifting over the grasses , and small birds swooping low across them , calling the rain . But it was no part of it he had ever seen before . He was alone in the midst of the marsh and the mist , with the night falling and no idea where in all the wide leagues the smithy or the Causeway might be , and no way to get back.  |p126For  a moment he believed he was back in the throes of his fever , and that this was just another trick it played on his senses . Then his numbed feet protested ; it was no dream , though he might as well have wakened out of one . He stepped gratefully out of the icy rivulet he had landed in and sat down on the bank to wring out his boots and stuff them with what dry grass he could find . They were stout ones a trader had given him , and he was glad he had been wearing them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was tired and cold , and hunger grew on him as he sat , a ravening hunger . He had hardly anything with him , less even than he had had when he came to the saltmarshes ; he was without even his valued bird-bow and fishing lines . A thought struck him , and he fumbled at his belt . The sword was not there , and he panicked for a moment before he noticed it lying on the bank a little further upstream , presumably where he had first halted . That was something , anyway , the minimum to keep him warm , and protect him . As he stooped to pick it up he saw beside it a single wide hoofprint in the mud , with water still oozing into it . He sprang up and stared around , but nowhere on earth or sky was there a rider to be seen . The blood roared and rumbled in his ears . " You bastard bitch 's son ! " he muttered , gripping the hilt tightly.  | " What 've you done to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But he left it at that . He did not dare voice the question of how he was going to get back ; it might have no answer . First things first . He had to look around , find at least some indication of where he was . By the stars  --  but there would be none visible tonight , nor moon either . Somewhere behind those clouds the sun was setting ; he could make a rough guess where , and marked the direction as he tramped back to his boots . They were nothing like dry , but he could not afford to be fussy . He hauled the grass out , and cursed when it came out covered in fine sand  --  sand ? He peered at the rivulet , dug his fingers into the bed . The soft heavy stuff poured through his fingers , and a salty , seaweedy smell rose to his nostrils . He looked up and down the winding bank . The grass here was much taller , head-high in many places , and with broader leaves . In between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand verbena , all plants he remembered from his childhood but had never seen by the Causeway . He swallowed , stood up , sniffed the air again , and listened . The smell was strong in the air , far stronger than the slight tang he was used to . That rumbling sound  --  it had not been his blood , not entirely . Somewherenot far from here , more or less in the direction the sun had gone , surf was beating upon a beach . He swallowed again , with difficulty , for his throat was very dry . Once , when they had been talking about the Ekwesh beginning to raid inland , he had asked Kathel and his partners if the Causeway was safe at such a lonely point . And Kathel had replied with a laugh , " Surely enough ! The marshes are really a river delta , they spread wider as they near the sea . So naturally they built the Causeway high up the delta , inland , to keep it short . So you know how far your smithy is from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel fine and safe ? " Once it had . Once . Now it crushed him . He knew now where the smithy was ; he could walk there simply by keeping the sunrise ahead of him , sunset behind . But seventy leagues ! When two or three was a good day 's walking over marshy ground ? He sat in silence , and listened to the surf , and despaired . But as his hearing became more used to the rumbling sound he began to hear other noises through it , some high-pitched soundsp128that might be the voices of birds , or seals . . . or men . He delayed only a moment before getting up and cautiously wading out through the mist that was rising and flowing like the ghost of a flood . Men meant fire , and food , and company , a chance to survive in this dreadful place . They might be hostile , of course  --  but he had his sword . It was a shorter walk than he expected before he found the flatness of the ground changing to grassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut mountains . Through one of these deep clefts he heard the voices more clearly . The mist hung thickly now , but as he peered cautiously round the end of the dune onto the open beach , the red glow of a fire shone out through the mist like a welcoming beacon . A looming silhouette hid the actual flames , a slender neck curling upward from a dark bulk on the sand  --  by the look of it the high prow of a ship . It did not seem to be of Ekwesh kind ; that did not necessarily mean it was safe to approach , and he hefted the sword thoughtfully . The Mastersmith had taught him enough swordplay and other warrior arts to judge what made a good or bad weapon , but he had never used them in anger , and was not eager to . There was no cover at all here ; the sand was so flat he would gain nothing even by crawling up on his belly . He would just have to walk in openly , and trust to his luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he strode briskly across the crisp damp sand his hand hovered near the hilt . From time to time great beams of light and shadow played up across the mist-curtain as unseen figures crossed and recrossed in front of the flame . But he reached the dark side of the hull without challenge and stood there a moment , resting a hand on the barnacled timbers . It came away slimy , flecked with weed fragments . As he slipped along the length of the vessel he saw tangles of half-dry weed hung from a mass of twisted metal at the outthrust curve of the bows ; evidently it was not long beached . He could hear voices on the far side , but no clear words ; he must needs take his chance . Cautiously he stepped round the bows  --  and found himself suddenly in a circle of firelight , with a host of astonished faces staring up at him . They were pale faces , mostly , but as wild and wolfish as any Ekwesh . Their eyes widened , and in an instant the whole crowd ofp129them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a hiss of weapons drawn . Elof held up his hands , then ducked violently as an axe flew past his head and boomed against the hull . Quickly he put his back to the wood and swept out his own sword as the menacing semicircle of men closed in . " Stand back ! " he shouted . " I do n't mean you any  --  " A heavy blade cut out at his head , and he met it with a twohandedparry which tore it from its wielder 's hand . His attackers fell back a pace , but a fat fair-haired man in the middle bellowed and sprang forward , lunging at him with a halberd . As Elof jumped aside the lunge became a sideways cut and he had to swing round to fend it off ; the halberd dug into the hull , was hauled out and jabbed at him again . Elof flailed his sword out against it , and sent the fat man stumbling back . Furious at being harried , Elof shouted and leaped forward , whipping the black blade whistling around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their haste to give ground . He heard somebody shouting in the sothran tongue for spears and bows . But the fat man stood his ground ; Elof had to meet him , and aimed a chopping downward cut that should have made him jump . Instead he brought up the butt of the halberd , and Elof 's blade skidded ringing down the iron rods that bound it . Immediately the halberd seemed to spin round , and the blade scythed at his throat . Elof cut at it with desperate strength ; this time the sword struck the haft squarely and sheared right through it , iron , wood and all , leaving the fat man staring stupidly at a useless truncheon . Elof kicked the fallen blade behind him and stepped back . Maybe now they 'd listenHe heard the pad of feet an instant too late , saw his other attackers jump back , and whirled to meet the man who came running round the prow . He saw only a blurred , crouching outline , taut and compact , and a flash of red hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elof hewed at it as he would a tree , and with all his strength , and the sheer force behind the ringing collision sent the newcomer staggering back . But he recovered at once by spinning on his heel , and his sword leaped at Elof from an unexpected side . Elof just managed to parry , but the other 's blade seemed to turn supple as a serpent and flow around his , till , with a sudden violentp130twist , it wrenched it right out of his grasp . Every muscle and joint in Elofs hand shrieked with the pain of near-dislocation , and he stumbled back clasping it under his other arm . His sword thudded into the sand . A heavy boot rested on it . The other men raised their weapons and rushed forward with a yell , then stopped abruptly as they came up against the flat of ablade . The newcomer was holding them back as he looked Elof up and down . " Spears and bows just to deal with this ? " he demanded coldly , in very clear sothran speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If ' e is a man ! Do n't look canny t'me . Came at us off the marsh , ' e did ! Ca n't take chances  --  " " I think we may delay butchering him long enough to ask aquestion or two . Well ? " the newcomer asked , turning to Elof again . " Do you understand me ? " " Yes , I do , " said Elof . He took a second to study his opponentbefore saying anything more . The man had attacked in a stance which made him seem small , a hard target  --  the ploy of a masterswordsman . Now that he was standing straight , he was a full head taller than Elof , but much leaner and narrower , hard and ageless . His garb of dark green tunic and breeches , though worn and stained , seemed plainer but sounder than the others ' crazy blend of rags and soiled finery ; it enhanced a certain dignity in his face . He had thesame cast of features as Roc or Kathel , but less rounded , longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheekbones and chin , the pale skin gold-tinged by the sun ; his hair was a darker , somber bronze-red , his eyes blue-gray as the sea mist and as hard to penetrate . They had a calm assessing quality which reminded Elof disturbingly of the Mastersmith , but seemed somehow less alarming . " I meant no harm , " Elof said . " I was lost on the marsh , wandering . I could not survive long out there without fire and shelter . I cameto ask for help . " " With a drawn sword ? " Elof bridled . " Not till your friends set on me ! Without giving mea chance to speak ! I tried to be civil , but  --  " "  --  never had the chance . I see ! " He raised his eyebrows at the fat man , who was aggrievedly picking up the pieces of his halberd . " Well , it may be as you say , but do not blame these lads too much.  |p131You  obviously know what manner of a place the Marshlands are ; travelers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rightly so ! How did you come to be lost in them ? " " I dwell in them , " said Elof , and there was a murmuring among the men . Some drew back , others hefted their weapons . " I 'm no spook ! " he said irritably . " Over by the Causeway  --  " " Then what 're you messin ' about ' ere for ? " growled the fat man . There was nothing to be gained by telling these superstitious creatures the full story . " I was exploring far afield for metal , and lost my way . " " Metal ? " barked the swordsman , with a look like a bird of prey stooping . " Yes , " said Elof calmly . " Iron , and old armor , for my trade . I 'm a smith  --  " Among the onlookers there was a sudden stir of interest , even of relief . The fat man rounded on them , but the swordsman snapped his fingers . " The Causeway ? That 's right , I 'd heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or so . . . And you have a smith 's sinew , that 's for certain . " He turned to the fat man . " What say you ? A stroke of good fortune at last ? " " It 'd make a change . If ' e 's what ' e says . If we can trust ' im . If ' e 's any good . Almi drank , but at least you knew where you were with ' im . I mean , what smith worth a damn 'd set up there , of all places ? " " Why do n't you try me , and find out ? " growled Elof , cold and hungry and irritated beyond measure . " An admirable suggestion , smith , " said the swordsman . " By your speech you 're a northerner . Do you know anything of ships ? " Elof shook his head . " I 've only ever been on one , and that by no will of mine . I know nothing of their making . " The swordsman sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not be any worse than he . See , smith , we were damaged in a seafight , barely limped back to this beach of ours , and the only smith among us dead  --  not in the fight , but of his drinking . Come and see  --  by your leave , skipper ? " The fat man grunted , but let them pass , and trailed along behind with the other men . " The woodwork we 've managed , " said the swordsman , " though there arep132precious few good trees in these parts . But there 's the worst of it , there at the keelscarf . " He gestured at a point just under the outward curve of the prow , where a scarf joint secured by heavy trenails joined the long single timber of the keel to the rising forestem timber . Here were the roots of that tangle of metal , braced against both timbers . Elof , peering past the weeds , could see that the metal had once been a great harpoon-head of steel , with a comb of barbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must turn the whole ship into a gigantic spear , but now it hung sadly askew , the barbs twisted and cracked . " Our ramming skeg , " said the swordsman . " What you northerners would call iarnskekke , I believe  --  the iron beard . Without it we 've no chance against bigger ships . If you can make that whole for us again , you 're welcome to fire and a blanket and such food as we have . Well ? " Elof stepped forward to peer at the wreck , wondering furiously just who these men were . The fat man and the others could easily be corsairs , but this big swordsman spoke like something better than a brigand , or at least more intelligently . Elof had more sense , though , than to ask outright , at least for now ; he bent all his attention to the broken skeg , running his fingers over the twisted metal . It had been solid and sound once , but there must have been one impact too many . . . Suddenly he straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't it ? " The swordsman looked tellingly at the fat skipper , who ducked his head unwillingly . " Aye , t'were so , a few months gone . Almi fixed it good enough  --  " " He did not ! Look here and here at the barb , these are cracks , but there 's rust inside them , and some other filth ! He must just have covered them over , so no wonder they 've failed you now . And here he 's just soldered the break , where it should have been forged fast again  --  " " Typical , " murmured the swordsman . " Well , smith , it speaks well for you that you 're so keen of eye . But can it be remade now ? " " Oh , easily enough . . . " began Elof casually , and then faltered . An awful ache of loss and helplessness settled on him , so strongly it must have showed . The captain 's face hardened , and he looked significantly at his men , but Elof caught his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally enough I was n't carrying them when I  --  got lost . " " Naturally enough , " said the swordsman unconcernedly . " Down by the fire there you 'll find Almi 's . I was about to try to use them in default of all else . But I know of this art only from books , I would not set myself against any smith and least of all a northerner . Will they do ? " Elof handled them distastefully . " They 're poor things for the most part , the only good ones among them old and worn beyond belief . And little or no feeling of power or even personality on any of them . " Only now , encountering a lack of it , did he realize how strong it had been in his own and the Mastersmith 's gear . " I ca n't imagine how your southern smiths manage without it  --  " But the faces around him , even the darker-skinned ones , ranged from baffled to contemptuous ; even the swordsman 's bore a look of tolerant amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sothran with some reading  --  wide reading , if he 'd studied smithcraft  --  made nothing of the true craft . If only he could show themIt might be that he could . " They 'll do , " he said . " Yes , I can repair it . But I 'll need a proper anvil  --  " " Almi 'd a little block of metal he used , " grunted the captain . " Popped it on a stump or anything ' andy . That do ? " " Very well , I expect . And a better forge  --  you can build one here on the beach , with stones , like this . . . " He drew a square box fireplace on the sand . " We can improvise bellows , of a sort . But if the wind gets up we can pull out a few stones on the right side and channel that instead . " " Clever ! " murmured the swordsman . " And how long  --  " Elof shrugged . " A day , a day and a night  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden lash of anger that triggered Elof 's own . " That 's no damned fault of mine ! " he snapped , standing up and glaring furiously into the lean hard face , fists clenching . Oddly enough , it was the captain who intervened . " Let ' im alone , Almi 'd take a week , and you or I longer if we did it at all . You want t'give ' im a whack , make it a fair whack.  |p134There  's a good chance we can still catch ' em in that time . " Slowly the lean man relaxed , and Elof realized that he had been tense and worried all this time . Many lines smoothed out of his brow , and suddenly he looked only a few years older than Elof , in his mid-twenties at most . " So , " he said . " I agree , we should be grateful for what we have . To work , then , my lad  --  " " After I 've eaten , by your kindness , " said Elof calmly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give you of my best . Oh , and had my sword back , if you please . I ca n't do much till the forge is built , anyway . " The captain growled his wrath , but the swordsman laughed suddenly . " Very well ! I will go bail for your good faith . You shall eat and rest while we labor on it , that is fair exchange for our rough handling . The sword , though  --  " He turned and scooped it up from the sand , and hefted it admiringly . " A fair blade , I confess I covet it . And I did best you of it . . . " Elof frowned . " But that only makes me understand your concern all the better . I was going to say you would have it when you were done , but you might rest ill without it . Here ! " He passed it over formally , hilt forward across an arm . Elof took it , and bowed equally formally . " You are generous , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best I can , in the least time . " The swordsman nodded . " A fair-spoken smith for your boldness . My name is Kermorvan , second-in-command of this desperate crew under Captain Ermahal here . May I know yours ? " " Elof , smith of the Causeway , now of no guild or master . " " And all the better for that , I am sure , " said Kermorvan lightly . " Well , Elof , you 'll be wanting your food and rest  --  Maile , do you go and find him some . The rest of you , up , about and find big stones , flat if you can , and bring them up the beach there  --  " Later , when his stomach was full , and he was winding himself in a coarse blanket by the fire , Elof thought over all that had happened . It had been a dangerous spot , that , at first . But he had been right to be bold with this Kermorvan fellow , who seemed to be the real power in the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it ? With a slight shock he realized that the swordsman 's generosityand courtesy had effectively turned the whole scene on its head , had been calculated to do so . He was now under obligationp135to these people , instead of the other way round . For a moment he bridled at that , but sighed . It would only bind a man of honor  --  which meant that Kermorvan considered him one . It was a compliment , of a sort , but a mightily awkward one , when he had no idea who these cutthroats were , or what use they would make of that fearsome skeg . But he simply could not worry about all that now , his whole frame was one leaden ache of exhaustion . The soft sand drifted away from under him . To his surprise Kermorvan was waiting by the new-built forge , tapping experimentally on the little anvil erected next to it . The clear ringing knifed through Elof 's head ; he had slept no more than an hour or two , after missing what might be one night or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work , for which they first had to detach the tangled mess from the prow . That meant hammering parts of it away above and below to get at the big rusty bolts , and while Elof was perched on a stack of seachests , straining at one of these , his hand barked painfully against a rod that felt like wood , not metal . Reaching down into the tangle , he found it was a heavy catapult arrow , stuck into the hull timbers , and he worked it loose with his pincers . But as he pulled it out he let out a gasp of surprise , for he remembered those black and white fletches only too well . Kermorvan looked up from the bolt he was working on , and nodded . " Yes , smith , those are our enemies . And if I guess right , yours also . It is the Ekwesh we fight . And in that lies our need for haste ! " Between them they manhandled the unwieldy ram up the sand to the forge . " From what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be sailing northward along this stretch of coast before night tomorrow , and it would burn my heart to let them pass un-challenged ! " Elof nodded fiercely , and turned to stoke up the forgefire . " Then haste you shall have . And . . . anything else I can bring to the work . " There were words he remembered , fragments of chants , snatches of verse , that had to do with the striking power of spearheads . If some of those could be adapted to the ram , if he had truly seen more than the firelight in that swordhilt  --  Then a thought struck him , and he turned again , in sharp and sudden puzzlement.  | " You say northward ? When the Ekwesh are on their way home ? But why not attack when they 're headed south in the first place , before they 've done their pillaging  --  " Then he saw the look on Kermorvan 's face . " Oh , " he said , " I see . " " It is the only way they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defensive . " When there is loot to be gained , profit to be made . They are corsairs , after all , these lads ; I can not change their nature all at once . And they are few , and must lurk here in the cover of these mists , picking off a boat at a time here and there . But at least they will fight ! And that 's more than anyone else I could find ! " Elof stood there horrified , the true import of what he had heard only just coming home to him . " You mean  --  the Ekwesh have come this far , and beyond , into the rich south itself ? And nobody will resist them , not even there ? " " Not after what happened to the first who tried . Every year they have grown bolder , working their way down the coasts of your lands and nearer to Kerbryhaine , that you call Suderney , till at last a sizable fleet came to harry our northern ports . The Marchwarden of these parts , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grew impatient waiting for the syndics to act . He raised his own levies against the raiders without waiting for help from the city . By weight of numbers it should have been enough to obliterate them , ten times over . But the levies were cut down to a man , an utter rout and massacre . So now nobody will march against the raiders . " " But  --  but we always thought of you sothrans as so rich , so powerful , with high walls to dwell behind and armies no lord would dare challenge . . . I do n't understand it . " Kermorvan shrugged . " We have armies but no fighters , captains but no leaders . We have been at peace too long , no bad thing save that we can not now preserve it . The Syndicacy is all the government we have now , a gaggle of fat men who can not agree the time of day without a full session in council . The Marchwarden , being charged with the peace of our northern borders , he had more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reivers in the Debatable Lands , and corsairs such as th  --  as we . And the syndics squat behind the city walls and find reasons in their pursesp137not to fight , hoping the blow will not fall in their time . " He drew a deep breath . " And since they can not vent their fears on the cause of them , instead they do so upon any who  --  never mind ! Something must be done , however little , to convince the barbarians that they will not have the Southiands to themselves as they have had Nordeney  --  " " My folk did n't just lie down before them ! " said Elof sharply , levering at a cracked joint with heavy pincers , surprised at how easily he could forgive the poor folk of Asenby now . " They fought ! " " Aye , " said Kermorvan , " when they had no other choice , I would wager . So no doubt will mine , when the enemy is at their gates . But by then it will be too late , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did with yours , instead of finding it a solid bulwark against him . If they could wipe out the Marchwarden 's troops without crippling loss to themselves , then no one region or town , not even the city itself , can stand against them alone . " Elof nodded , remembering the well-fed complacency of Harthaby , while the ruins of Asenby , only a few days ' sail away , were still smoking . Was Harthaby yet standing ? " You have the right of it . So it has been with us , indeed . " To his surprise Kermorvan shook his head . " I blame your land much the less . It has never been united , nor had much chance to be . Its first settlers deliberately chose independence over dominion , and I shall not say they were wholly wrong . " Elof looked at him , surprised . This was a man of lore , in his way , and no mere swordswinger . " You seem to know more of the histories of the north than I do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , and so he did  --  but along a very narrow path , I now see . Tell me something of this lore as I work ! " " As we work ! " said Kermorvan , more cheerfully . And at first he did his best to make his boast true . In the taking apart of the damaged ram his wiry , unflagging strength was a great help , but he had scant breath left for talking . When that was achieved , though , there was little he could do save stand and watch Elof at his filing and hammeringand grinding , and take a turn at the crude bellows when needed . Then he did indeed tell many tales , as the night wore on , in the tongues of both south and north , in which he seemed almostp138equally fluent . Elof could only marvel at how little he had known before of either Nordeney or Suderney , and the wider world around them . Of the land of Kerys the swordsman told , now a name of legend , no more , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the many of its two kindred peoples who then ventured across the wide oceans to settle in the eastern lands of this vast country they called Brasayhal , hoping that here their children would live free of its malice forever . " But that was not to be , " said Kermorvan , the dark burr of the north as deep in his voice as any native 's , " and when after many generations the Ice made its dread way down toward them , there was division in their state . As our Southlands are today , it was centered around the great city known as Strangenburg in your tongue  --  the City by the Waters , heart and mind of its realm , and to which the other towns , even their first strong settlement on the eastern shore , were as mere outposts . They dearly loved that place , high and fair , mirroring the lost splendors of Kerys . But many in terror of the Ice now wished to abandon their lands altogether and to flee southward and westward , despite the dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this land which they must either brave or skirt round . But they did not know how long that would take , or even if it was possible , or whether it would lead them to habitable lands at all . In the end , it came to a sundering of the kindred ; most of one chose to go , most of the other chose to stay . Those who stayed had come originally from the more northerly ranges of Kerys , and perhaps yet endured the worsening cold more gladly . Their kings , though , came of both peoples blended many times over ; they stayed , and tried to persuade or compel as many as possible to do the same . But the others fled . " He fell silent for a moment as Elof chanted a scrap of harsh verse over one of the tines of the comb , and he stood staring into the forgeflames . Shining steel ! Spirit of falcon ! Spearpoint , mark you my word ! As a shaft of sunlightCleaves the cloud-roofStrike asunder where you are sent !  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to undertake so perilous a journey . Others said that by fleeing they were only serving the will of the Ice , and called them cowards and fools for choosing to risk terrors unknown rather than helping preserve what they could of their own hard-won domain . Myself , I do not know ; but I think I would have stayed . As it befell , in the end there was much bravery on both sides . For the ones who fled came across the mountains to these warm Southlands only after many trials , and a good half of their number perished along the way . There are tales of high heroism and great sacrifice in the journey , and the forging of the new realm . " But in the east also there were heroes . Then , if ever , lived Vayde and many other mighty names . They held the realm together for two generations more , as the cold grew worse around them and the Ice and all it brought with it came sweeping across their northern borders . But in the end it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right up against the whole proud City by the Waters and ground it to powder beneath them . And there it lies to this day . Then those who were left abandoned their kings in bitterness , who had persuaded them to stay , and they too fled . Some went to the lesser towns in the east , but a good number went in the wake of their brethren , west and south . Many perished ; some won through , at a cost even more appalling than their forerunners , for they were fewer , and ill prepared . That too was a time for heroes . But they found scant welcome in the birthpangs of the new realm of Kerbryhaine , for the bitter words and names once given had not lost their force , and some , it is said , yet lived who had endured them . So against heroism must be set great cruelties , and treachery and villainy on both sides . In the end the newcomers left their brethren and escaped to the more northerly parts of the lands betweenmountains and sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared to settle . There , as time passed , they met and mingled with fellow refugees , brown-skinned folk from far westward across ocean and Ice . And that was the origin of your Northlands . " The new settlers made widely scattered settlements , for the northerners had always been the outlivers of Kerys and the Eastlands . But without a central city to serve , this left them poor and weak , and though the enmity between north and south long ago grewp140cool , and there has been trade and a measure of friendship between us for many centuries , still the cities of the north can not combine with each other to defend themselves , let alone with us . The habit of independence is grown too strong . " Elof nodded somberly , watching the two ends of a weld begin to glow in the fire . " I remember my own little town . The only link with the world beyond the walls was the guilds and the traders , and the word of Headman and elders the only law . rl'hey would never dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only reinforced by the brown-skinned folk , for they were fleeing the bloody rise of the Ekwesh empire , and feared nothing more than creating another . They were peaceful farmers and fishers , not used to looking much beyond soil , sea and season , and they had paid their own toll in blood to find that peace . The settlers then were realizing how few they were against the south , which they feared , and how slow to increase ; small wonder they made these sturdy newcomers welcome . So today 's northerners are a good folk , but ever an inward-looking one . And that is a perilous thing to be , when the Ice is shaping its malice against you ! " Elof put down his hammer a moment , and looked at him . " My master talked as you do about the Ice , as if it was a live thing  --  " Kermorvan 's eyes widened . " But it is ! He told you no more than that ? " He shook his head in wonder . " Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a crooked one . Know what every child of our land learns ! There is indeed a living will behind the Ice , and a malign one . It  --  or they , for it is said there may be more than one  --  hates all living things ; I do not know why , but it does . Most of all it hates us , we humans , and what little order and civilization we have won for ourselves . It may make use of men for a time , but it seeks to drive us back to the level of the beasts , so that it may destroy us as freely as they . Thus it especially hates we of Kerbryhaine , furthest from its grasp , strongest against its purpose . The Ice is its weapon , slow but inexorable in its advance . Did I not tell you how it spearheaded south to cover the great city ? Nowhere else has it yet dared come so far , though it chafes ever at the mountains north of your land  --  " " That I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fromp141the fire and set them together with a rain of light taps . " I have heard it . " " You have heard . . . " Kermorvan shook his head , momentarily lost for words . Then he burst out , " But how did you dare go so close ? The Ice is not empty , but peopled with fearful creatures , fellt beasts and other terrible things that I can give no names to ; that will draws them as it draws all unhallowed things , they ride the Ice as they might a ship and fare ahead as its vanguard , spreading death and terror . They come wherever its power is strong , at times even down to the marshes here with its meltwaters . How did you dare ? " Elof was silent a moment . The hammer stood poised in his hand , but did not fall . For he was thinking , remembering , as he had not for a long time , his first sight of the gleam in the sky , and the Mastersmith telling of his pilgrimage , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice . Savagely Elof smote down upon the weld , with blows so fast and heavy that the sparks went dancing and skittering across the little anvil , and the pieces of hot steel seemed to flow together as one . He looked up , to see Kermorvan gazing at him with keen eyes . " I was astray , " he said , but nothing more . Kermorvan shrugged . " Who in this world is truly astray , I wonder ? There are other powers than those of the Ice , they say . Certainly it was a timely straying that led you to us . " He looked questioningly at Elof , seemed about to ask something outright . Elof hastily turned away and plunged the fastened metal into the improvised quenching trough , and was grateful for the concealing cloud of steam that arose about him . There were too many questions he did not yet wish to answer , even to himself  --  least of all to this strange man , who had been careful to say so little of himself . And it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added , " At least , timely if I do not keep us from our work . " He looked around him , at the first faint tinge of gray in the mist . " Dawn approaches . How long . . . ? " " Seven hours , perhaps eight . And another hour to refit it , I think . The mount should be reinforced . " Kermorvan growled . " Let us hope we have that long , then . Thesep142chants of yours , these symbols you 're scratching . . . Will they really achieve anything ? " Elof smiled as he selected two more strips of metal and jabbed them into the fire . " That 's to be seen . They are not slowing my work . Not by more than minutes . " " No ? Those minutes may count ! " He spoke harshly , in the effort to rein in his eagerness . " But go ahead ! You must work as you know best how . " " I thank you ! " said Elof , and meant it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responsibility ; this Kermorvan did know how to sway people to his purposes . " I think . . . I think they are worth trying , though they will be less effective on something not new-made . You understand , it is not the power of the art that I doubt . It is myself . " Kermorvan , suddenly nonchalant again , rubbed a thumb over his stubbled chin . " Then I think you need have no fears . " Elof shrugged , turning the metal in the forge . " We will see , in a few hours . " " Perhaps . And what then , Elof ? " " You set out to fight the Ekwesh . " " And you ? " " I ? I turn for home , " Elof plucked out the longer piece , and began to straighten it . " Though if you could set me ashore above or below the heart of the Marshlands it would make my path shorter and safer . . . " He hesitated , and did not know why . Kermorvan appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area before we fight , here where there is always mist to cloak us . And we can not return to it afterward , not for weeks ; the fleet may stay and search , or leave a force to trap us . So we can only land you if you take ship with us , now . " He leaned forward fiercely , and red forgelight shone against his keen gray eyes . " Why not , Elof ? It 'll be uneven enough as it is  --  fifty of us to maybe a hundred of them . Someone like you might well turn the scale . " Elof snorted . " I 'm no warrior  --  " " No ? If you 're not , who is ? You 're strong even for a smith , and fast . You 've some swordplay , at least . And you hate the Ekwesh , that 's clear . So come with us ! "  | " Aye , come ! " grunted the captain , stumping up through the mist . " Got the better of me , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kermorvan ? And speaking of that , if you 've a moment , perhaps you would n't mind fixing some bands on a new ' alberd-shaft ... " Elof gave a splutter of laughter . " That , at least , and ones that wo n't cleave so cleanly . For the rest  --  we 'll see ! Now , somebody put their back to those bellows , or we 'll never have this thing straight  --  " The sun stood past noon before he had done , and the mists had thinned to a heavy haze . A new strong mounting was prepared , and the reforged ram swiftly bolted into place . At once the captain had the corsairs scurrying about to raise the mast and reload their gear , but Kermorvan seemed unable to tear himself away from the weapon , running fascinated fingers over the dark menacing gleam of the metal . " I take back my words ! " he said with soft exultation . " You have made this a finer thing than ever it was  --  stronger , sharper . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm sand , Elof took a moment to understand what he was hearing . Then abruptly he rolled over and scrambled up , eager to look but hardly daring . What was the swordsmanseeing ? Could it be that he also had a touch of the art in his blood ? " Like fish darting in a pool ! " added Kermorvan , entranced . " As if sunlight truly were forged into it , as they tell of the duergar smiths of old  --  ach , I waste time ! But now we 've a real chance ! " He turned away to call for ropes and rollers to be readied . Gingerly Elof reached out and touched the warm metal , peered at it , into it . Under the greenish sheen of the steel a light coursed indeed , now strong , now pale , pulsing like blood in veins . The work , crude as it was , had come alive under his hands . On impulse he plucked his sword up from where it lay by his cloak and jerkin on the sand , and gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at him though the sky above was clear , glancing and shifting in the mesh , vagrant as thoughts . The realization , the honing of hopes he had deliberately dulled , was almost painful , like stirring a limb long unused . But there was no escaping it , and pleasure in the very pain . He should have suspected as muchp144the moment he touched the clumsy old hammers and pincers , felt the emptiness in them ; he had not even noticed it in his work for Hjoran . It took power to perceive power  --  and the lack of it . With a surging yell of sheer joy , he hurled the sword wheeling into the air and caught it , closing his fingers round the cool glitter of the hilt , clutching it to him . What it might be he could not guess , but a virtue dwelt in that hilt . His art was his again , and his long healing complete . " A martial sight you are , of a sudden ! " laughed Kermorvan , striding up the beach . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to fight alongside us , or of slinking away to rot in your smithy  --  assuming you ever find it again ? " Elof thrust the black blade vertically down into the sand , to stand like some sinister outgrowth . How strange , that he should have worked some quality into the hilt , and not know its purpose . But then , what did he know of his own , now ? Go back to the marshes and live as before ? The fenland had seemed so right for him once , a place of hiding , not so much from the Mastersmith as from his own self-loathing , a bitter purge needed for a mind made sick . He had found punishment in suffering , and made some restitution , perhaps ; there were many travelers now safe who would not have been but for him . And in that , it seemed , he had also found healing . Now , for all their bleak loneliness , the fenlands had almost become a safe haven , a retreat where he could go on living a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting his cares and fears . But was he right to forget them , now his health and his craft had come back to him ? Was it right to go on hiding ? The world marched on and would not wait for him , squatting in the rushbeds . What of his vengeance on the Ekwesh ? What of his debt to Roc ? What of his pledge to Kara ? And what of the grim power he had unwittingly set in the hands of a ruthless man ? For a moment he felt bewildered , but a moment only . Then he nodded , at once angered and amused . Whatever strange power had brought him here , it had chosen its time with care . The Ekwesh were growing bolder , and he aided them who failed to resist them . Whatever good he could do in the smithy , he could do more in the world beyond . And there was so much of that to see , so much to learn , and he was yet young.  |p145He  turned to Kermorvan , and plucked the sunwarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him . " All right , you sothran pirate ! I 'll come ! But on one condition only ! That when this fight 's done , if I choose I 'll count myself quit . And you 'll set me ashore then within easy reach of a town , and food and gear to get there . Agreed ? " " So be it ! " barked Kermorvan , with gusto . " We could clasp hands on it , but I 've another idea . It 's still too clear to launch , the Ekwesh would spot us leagues off . We must needs wait . That maddens me , so as well pass the time making you some semblance of a swordsman . Shall we cross blades on it ? " Kermorvan 's long sword hissed out , gray steel glittering before eyes that matched it . Elof grinned , and the black blade gleamed in sullen magnificence . He copied the stance Kermorvan had used . " Fair trade , for the smithcraft I 've taught you ... " So they swung and sparred through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiming through the thickening haze . The loafing corsairs gathered round to watch and laugh as Elof was stung by the flat of the gray blade , or sent sprawling on his face with the surf lapping round him like an anxious dog ; they had all suffered under Kermorvan 's instruction . But soon enough , as the mist came rolling in across the little bay , they ceased to laugh , and nodded thoughtfully , and laid small wagers against the coming plunder . For Elof 's sheer strength told against the subtlety he lacked , and the same eye and hand that placed blows so accurately on the anvil he could turn against his opponent . At length , hilts locked , they swayed eye to eye , breath hissing through dry lips . " Better ! " Kermorvangasped . " One day  --  a great manslayer  --  had you only the will ! " " Sooner  --  beat metal  --  than men ! " wheezed Elof . The tall man laughed , and was about to answer when there came a shout from the high dunes behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A black sail ! " " Hands to launch ! " bellowed the captain , bounding to his feet . " Shift yer scuts , to the ropes ! " Kermorvan dropped his guard and sheathed his sword in one fluid movement , and went pounding off to join the other corsairs , dragging Elof with him . A spring cable , rigged between the sternpost , a solid old tree stump and the bowp146capstan , pulled the vessel forward on its rollers , while those crewmen not straining at the capstan bars rushed back and forth taking rollers out from under the stern and thrusting them under the advancing bows . Elof , scrambling over the stern , was amazed nobody was crushed , but it was a practiced operation , and the long sleek hull slipped into the oily-calm waters of the bay with hardly a splash . The mist curled around her low gunwales , and wreathed itself around the legs of the roller crewmen being hauled aboard , as if it wanted to hold them back . Many of the men clutched amulets , or made superstitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second , muttering low words . Elof , for his part , simply looked back at the shore , but it was already no more than a shadow in the mist , and even the marshy odor was lost in the myriad smells and stenches of the ship , from tar and damp sealskin sleeping bags to unnamed foulness in the bilges . The captain brought a heavy oilclothbundle forward , and as he unwrapped it carefully the bow lanterns glinted on a great beast-head , carved and gilded , with staring eyes of red glass and long jaws filled with brass fangs . He reached up and fixed it into a socket atop the forestern , so it rode high over the bows as if on an arching swan-neck . " Amicac ! " cried the crew , and cheered wildly . Elof shuddered . " Why do they bear the Sea Devourer so gladly as an emblem ? " he whispered to Kermorvan . " What better sign for a corsair ? " said the swordsman darkly . " A terror , a scourge and a curse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlaws or exiles , who might as easily be slain by our own folk as our enemies . " He laughed bitterly . " Perhaps we have made our own compact with the Devourer . We send him food , or are ourselves sent down to feed him . Why should we not claim his protection ? Out with your sweeps there ! Fix locks ! " The oarsmen took their benches , and the long heavy sweeps were passed out over the gunwales and mounted on the heavy pivot pins that served as rowlocks . They were held poised a moment , as if about to row through mist rather than water , but as the captain gave the word and struck his halberd upon the deck they dipped and strained in perfect unison , and the lean craft lifted its bows and flew forward , the dark glassy water chuckling and gurgling delightedly around the new ram.  |p147Someone  began to sing softly , and after a moment the others took it up , a slow , rather sad chantey , in time with the stroke . Riding the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea-Maiden ! Streaming her tresses , Bright as sun , White her breasts the gull's-road cresting ! Body so slender , Pale as foam , Silken her flanks through seaswell gliding ! Kermorvan 's clear voice rang out over the chorus . Saithana , come to me , Leave me not drifting Sleeping so lonelyWhere tideway takes me And the cold claws tear ! " Aye , let ' em call on Saithana while they may , " grumbled the skipper to Elof , " for d' you know , sir smith , that she 's the promise of drowned men ! Now we 'll needs thrash about till we find the bleeders , and that 's chancy business in night and murk . " " But that 's when it must be , " added Kermorvan calmly , " for we can not match the Ekwesh in daylight and under sail . But they are poor navigators , and sail always by following the coasts , and in that is our hope . They must pass the delta , where there is always mist somewhere , and in that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickening fog , where Elof could see nothing . An instant later Kermorvan rapped out an order , and the chantey died away . He rested an ear against the gunwale , as if listening . " Passing the headlandrocks , by that swell  --  eh , skipper ? " The captain listened a moment , and nodded . Elof felt the gentle rise and fall beneath his feet grow slower and stronger as they moved out into open sea , though there was still only the faintest breath of a breeze . " Right then ! " added Kermorvan . " Douse lanterns , muffle your rowlocks ,  |p148batten  down anything loose and most of all your mouths , for there 'll be no more shouted orders ! We want to hear those reiving bastards before they hear us , remember ? Stick to it , then , and this voyage 'll see us all rich men ! " One subdued cheer answered him , and then a silence thicker than the fog fell about the ship . He turned to Elof . " Do not think the worse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them myself . " " How so ? " His hard fist thumped the tiller of the steering oar . " To buy and equip ships of my own ! To strike before the raiding , and not have to hover like vultures over the kill ! We have engaged four Ekwesh ships so far , and taken three , and I , poor exile as I am , I have saved all my shares  --  little enough so far , but I was not then second-incommand . Tonight we may see ! " Hours passed , and the corsair beat about , back and forth , searchingfor some trace of its foe , Kermorvan and the captain plotting their position only by the changing sounds of tide and current . A rare puff of wind would thin the fog , but for the most part the sail hung empty and lifeless , bedewed with the damp , while the corsairs strained at the oars and grew ever more tired and disheartened . Many said the Ekwesh must already have gone by them . Elof took turns rowing , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideous head , one hand tight on the forestay . He glanced down at the ram , cleaving the low swell beneath him , no longer sure he had done right to come , or whether he trusted the swordsman 's words . This clammy chill fogged his feelings , forever blank , pallid , silent .. . Or was it ? He leaned forward suddenly , holding his breath so it would not drown the faintness of the sounds he heard  --  creaks , splashes , rumblingof water under a hull , like an echo of the sounds from the ship beneath him , but far , far away in the paleness of the dawn . Could this somehow be a trick of the mist , mirroring and dispersing sound as it did light ? But he listened again , held his breath longer till he almost choked , thought he heard the laughter of harsh voices , as if the echo came now out of dark dreams of his youth . He slipped back down onto the deck and passed word aft to the captain andp149Kermorvan . The oars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening , and now the sounds grew clearer , drew even closer , till there was no mistaking them . " But whither away ? " puzzled the captain , " ' Ere one minute , there the next  --  ca n't get ' old of them at all  --  " " From ahead there ! " said Elof . " Off the port bow  --  " " No , starboard and moving up  --  " " But that drum 's astern ! " " Quiet ! " hissed Kermorvan suddenly , and rounded on the rowers in fury . " Back to your sweeps , damn you ! And row ! Row for your lives ! Helm , due north and be ready for anything ! Archers , to your posts ! They 're all around us  --  " The corsair boat surged forward , a momentary breath of wind arose around it and the mist rippled like a sail and grew briefly thin . Every man on board ducked down in that moment save Kermorvan , and he stood rooted to the spot . In the faint light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and higher in the water , went knifing through the swell on every side  --  not just one or two , but twenty at the least . Then the breeze slackened , and they blessed the mist as it fell again . There was no alarm , no hail of challenge , no creak of catapult winders ; the watch had not noticed them . Kermorvan grabbed Elof by the shoulder . " Into the bows , you and Maile , and listen out well ! There was one running in toward the shore , we can take him right now if we 're quick ! Boarding party , arm ! Helm  --  " Elof scrambled back to his perch with Maile the bosun on his heels , and they hung there listening , relaying whispered commands back to the helm as dark outlines loomed out of the mist around them . A faint thudding rhythm drummed through the hull under them , and the rise and fall of the oars quickened in time with it , the bows leaped and plunged hissing through the dark smooth ocean . The corsair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping under bows and bouncing over wash . " Aft , Maile , " said Kermorvan'svoice from behind them , " and to your post ! We 're through the thick of them now , and on his heels . Hear ? " Ahead of them now was a deeper , slower sweep of oars , the slowp150rumble of a drum and harsh voices chanting . Something or somebody was not chanting but wailing , on a high rising note of utter misery . Old memories rose bitter in Elof 's throat . He turned to Kermorvan . " Well ? Where shall I  --  " He stopped in astonishment . In the figure that stood there he saw nothing of Kermorvan . A high helm of dully gleaming metal , richly worked , reared on his head , and below it a mask visor in the form of a face , regal and proud but with a dire rage and cruelty in its slanted eyes and flared nostrils . A shining steel collar circled the throat , and below that a casing of dark mail from head to toe , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound about with a great belt of leather bearing axe and long dagger ; a long fur cloak hung from his shoulders , mailed boots covered his feet and steel gauntlets ringed with heavy faceted studs covered his hands , in which a great two-handed sword stood bare . Only mouth and chin were left clear of the metal , and the set of the thin lips accorded well with the vicious mask above . Like the statue of some war god brought to life in that fell mist he seemed , or some deadly machine of destruction . Even his voice was tinged with metal . " They grow bold indeed , those eaters of mansflesh . They amble home , where once they would have fled . " He paced forward , wrapping the cloak about him to muffle the ring of the mail . " Nevertheless they will be ready to fight quickly enough , and they have one deadly way to meet our attack . The very blades of their sweeps are set with steel edges , and kept sharp , so they can be swung along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No boarding party can pass  --  unless a way through is cut at once , before their archers can muster . A murderous task , standing and hacking at those sweeps  --  for that you need a strong sword and a stern will . I know , for I took that post in our last attacks , and many perished because I could not lead the boarding party . Will you now take it ? " Elof looked at him , and after a second he nodded . " Where must I stand ? " he asked , his voice suddenly hoarse . Kermorvan led him a little way aft , to where ten crewmen were gathering , bearing all manner of blades and axes , but wearing as armor only light steel caps and studded leather jerkins , many of Ekwesh type , and small round shields . He could see how many might die without a fully armed man to lead them aboard.  | " We have armor for you , if you will  --  no ? Then here 's your post , " the hard mouth whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we strike , and keep a hold on the for'ard shrouds here . Two sweeps at least we need cut away , a third if you can manage . Then follow us , or stay to fight off any who try to board us in turn . But hopefully we will keep them too busy for that little trick ! So  --  we are ready . Hold tight now , all of you . " The mask glared out into the mist , then aft to the tiller . " Are we within range of her , skipper ? Very well , then . Rowers , to ramming speed . " The words were quiet , but there was a great shout in them . The drumming on the deck grew louder , faster , and the rowers flung themselves forward on their oars , and back , gasping in great breaths as their backs strained , till the whole ship seemed to blow like one vast seabeast . It bounded forward , the serpent-head reared up at the prow in imitation of its terrible original , and the mist flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elof , and though he knew the risk , he sprang up to the gunwales , wrapping an arm round the deadeye , to see his bright ram-skeg go hissing across the water , like some vast arrow fired at the high inchoate wall of black and white that loomed up clearer and clearer ahead . Then the bow wave under it swelled suddenly and steepened , funneled between the two hullsThe mist exploded upward , and a giant hand plucked at his legs and lifted him off the gunwales ; the deck dropped away from under him like a gallows floor . For an instant he hung from the deadeye by one arm , frantically clutching his sword , then the deck swooped up to meet him again with a jarring , stinging impact . He reeled , and saw a vast flat serpent-head rise and strike at him ; he hewed wildly at its neck , there was a splintering of wood , and the sharpedgedsweep dropped away . He spun round on the shroud , leaned out as far as he dared and hacked down on the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jam against the planks of the corsair ship , splintering there as both vessels rose in the swell . He was just swinging back to the other sweep when the shroud was plucked like a harpstring in his hand and a figure swept past him from above , leaping into the gap he had opened and crashing down on the rail of the Ekwesh ship . With a cry of " Morvan morlanhal ! " Kermorvan swung his huge blade , and Elof saw two black-cladp152bodies bounce over the rail and slither down into the boiling water . Behind him grapples were flung , hooked on , and the corsairs went swarming across to where he cleared a space . Then the next sweep lanced violently forward , and Elof barely managed to swing his legs up under him before it crashed into the deck where they had been , planing great swaths from the planking . His boots slammed down on the haft , jamming the blade deep in the deck , and he severed the head with a blow . On the Ekwesh rail above came a chorus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charge of Ekwesh warriors washed over the boarding party and broke in eddies of disarray against Kermorvan 's sword . Now the masked figure was running forward , the boarders behind him in an arrowhead , and against the huge sword nothing stood , not shield or blade or the bodies of men ; Kermorvan cloved a clear path down the flank of the ship to the stern , out of sight . Elof saw an Ekwesh archer scramble up on the foredeck for a clear mark , then be pitched overboard , skewered on an arrow shot from the corsair 's stern . But another arrow sang down , one of the rowers coughed and sagged over his oar , and the others ducked , still pulling away at their killing pace . Archers were gathering behind the high rail , ready to fan the corsair with arrows and cut off the boarders . " Time we was ' opping , sir smith ! " bellowed the captain . He yelled something to his own archers and bounded across the gap . He barely made it , hung by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell with arrows in their throats as he clambered up . Shocked as Elof was by the bloodshed , something boiled over in him now ; he scrabbled up the shroud till he was above the milling Ekwesh deck , waited a moment as the ships rose and fell , then sprang . An arrow grazed his side as he leaped , he landed but fell askew and lost his sword . A dark-robed shape loomed up over him , he rolled aside and a blade clove the deck by his ear . He kicked out hard , the robe collapsed like a tent , and he had his sword and stabbed down hard . The robe doubled up around it , convulsed once with a dreadful choking yell and was still . He staggered up , staring appalled , fascinated at the gouts of scarlet on the black metal ; he , he had shed it , here was his revenge ! And then an Ekwesh with a spear was running at him ; he saw the spear rise and fall in remem/bered butchery and cut violently at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant with a wide scarlet seam the length of his hide breastplate , then fell bubbling in a heap . Torn between horror and exultation , Elof staggered drunkenly down the pitching deck ; the Ekwesh ship was being driven relentlesslyaway from the rest of the fleet as the corsair rowers kept up their thrust , and more and more of the Ekwesh oarsmen had to leave their oars to fight . High on the sterncastle , bodies of archers strewn around him , stood Kermorvan now , a terrible figure in mail that ran scarlet , raining blows on the Ekwesh who came boiling up from below decks , to be hewn down before they could even join the struggle . Others clambered up through the rowing benches , but were caught by the corsairs as they reached the main deck . The air quivered with weapons clashing , the corsairs ' hoarse war cries and the jarring howls of the Ekwesh . Blood pooled on the deck , greasy and slippery underfoot , and Elof saw the headless body of a warrior go skidding right across it and tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly he was back in the ruins of Asenby , with the old Headman dead at his feet and the women howling around him , being weighed up by those terrible eyes  --  and then the eyes were there before him , yellow and blazing with insensatehatred . With a horror of madness he lashed out at them . Something bit burning into his shoulder , he saw a dark-robed figure go cartwheeling and spinning away down the deck , thin limbs flying in all directions , and only then knew he had struck down a real man , and no mere illusion . The sword that had grazed his shoulder clattered at his feet and went rolling after its wielder , who lay sprawled against the base of the stemcastle . Elof stumbled forward and reached the sterncastle just as Kermorvan came clattering down the ladders , brandishing his sword , broken halfway down the blade , and hailed him . " That 's that ! She 's ours ! " Elof moved past him and turned over the figure of the man he had struck . The eyes glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great cut that had disabled his leg . " A chieftain , by his robe , " said Kermorvan , lifting it casually on his broken swordpoint . Somethingclattered at the man 's belt , long as a dagger , and Elof stooped swiftly to snatch it away . But as the cold thing touched his fingers ,  |p154he  stared in utter amazement . A crook-headed shaft of bronze metal it was , a broad ring hooked through its lower end , the strange , rich patterns and characters on it half worn to glossy smoothness by the passage of many hands , many years . He knew it so well , yet saw it now with altered eyes . He clutched it tight , that well-remembered thing , and the wash of cold yellow flame within seemed to shine between his fingers , to tingle against them , so strong was it . Had the old Ekwesh also perceived something , and kept it for that , as something numinous ? " This . . . " gasped Elof . " It came from my town . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And many others , no doubt . We 'll bind this carrion and take him aboard alive , lads . I would have words with him , and we have no time now ! " " All ' ands to unloading ! " roared the captain . " Move yer scuts , d' you want another shipload of these ' ere savages about our ears ? Strip this rat-pit from stem to stern ! " The corsairs scuttled this way and that , picking up discarded weapons and armor , stripping the dead of ornaments and prising up the grilles that covered the hold hatchways . Kermorvan took no part in this , but went slowly to the rail , leaned on it and fumbled to unfasten his helm with blood-greased fingers . Elof , hooking the goad to his belt , undid the fastening for him , and Kermorvan sighed gratefully as he slid the mask off ; it had left a deep bruised score in his face . " Kerys ! That was sickening ! " he said , licking dry lips . " You looked to be enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scrape the blood off his own sword . " So might you in the exercise of your craft and mystery , " said Kermorvan thinly , " forgetting for a moment where the sword you make may find a sheath ! I am no berserk ; I am glad to have returned these beast-folk their own physic in full measure , good weight , yes ! But joy in it as they do , no . This is a larger ship than ever we have taken before , and more heavily crewed  --  by Hel , what 's that ? " There was a sudden outbreak of noise from below decks , where most of the corsairs were foraging , and Elof remembered the screams he had heard . But before either of them could reach the main hatch there was a trampling of feet , and a horde of women spilled onp155deck  --  fair-skinned women , evidently sothrans , with one or two children clutched among them . At the sight of Kermorvan in his gory armor they stopped short , almost toppling lastcomers back into the hold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused , gestured helplessly and began trying to explain to them that they were safe and would be taken back home . It was his red hair and clear voice that calmed them , more than anything he said , and the firm way he ordered the corsairs to look after them ; they seemed almost as frightened of the corsairs as of the Ekwesh . At last all twenty-two women were lowered one by one into the corsair ship , some shrieking and struggling in the rope harness ; they were simple folk from farming villages , and most had never been in a boat before the raiders had seized them . Great bales of plunder were lowered after them , and last of all the old chieftain ; some of the bolder women mobbed him as he was bundled down , clawing , kicking and spitting . Then Kermorvan swung himself down into the corsair 's bows . Two crewmen brought spearshafts forward ; with them and Elof he levered the ram free of the shattered timbers , and the two ships bobbed apart . " So easily freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a daggertooth ! And not a mark on it , not a tine bent out of place  --  smith , may I never mock your mumblings again ! " But Elof was looking up at the Ekwesh deck , where a dull red glow was rising . The captain bellowed at the rowers , and they pulled away , but before they had gone two strokes ' distance flames crackled into the Ekwesh rigging , burned around the mast and licked at the furled sail . They pulled harder for all their weariness , afraid of sparks in their own tarry rigging , and as the hulk retreated in the mist they saw the bindings flare and the high sail come crashing down , to vanish in an instant in a sheet of fire . " I hope the Devourer likes his meat cooked ! " said Kermorvan drily . " I found fire burning in some kind of shrine upon the sterncastle , carefully enclosed in metal and brick . What smoked there as an offering I will leave unsaid . I kicked it over . Now let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Elof . " If you capture these  --  " " I can not use them , and nobody would buy such things . I mightinfiltrate a fleet more easily , but after the fighting I need smaller ,  |p156faster  craft like this  --  ten , fifteen oars a side , not thirty ! Craft that can outrun the Ekwesh for short stretches , as we must do now , yet carry goods and men enough ! " He grimaced . " And women . I foresee trouble , before all 's done ! " But despite his misgivings , the women seemed to settle down well enough , more so perhaps because they had no homes to go back to . The corsairs , too , were quiet , for they had the exhaustion of battle and of rowing to keep them so . But great stores of supplies had been captured from the Ekwesh , and they were promising themselves a feast ashore . Six had been slain , another two had wounds they would die of , but the rest were luxuriating in the sheer joy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their turns at the oars with the rest , and they kept up a fair speed . They had to row for some hours through the mists , but at last these thinned and blew away , and they were able to hoist sail and make northward for another of their secret landings , a small hidden cove among the tall cliffs of a bay , invisible from seaward . Then Kermorvancalled crewmen to take his oar and Elof s , and went aft to where the Ekwesh chief lay bound , guarded from the women 's spite by a corsair too wounded to row . One woman plucked at Kermorvan'ssleeve as he passed . " Sir , let us at him ! Please ! He ... ) I Shechoked . " There was all our menfolk , even the little ones  --  took us off aship with our daughters  --  mine only ten  --  and then that one , he , he came and he took ... " Kermorvan looked at Elof . There was no girl of that age among the women , had been none anywhere on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's hand . " He lives only to tell what he knows . You have looked on horror enough ; I am sorry . I will see justice done for you , as befits my station . " " I , or you , " he added to Elof as they waved away the guard . " For you have a score also to settle with this creature . " Elof shook his head . " You may have the high justice ; I do not . And , whatever else , I see a sick old man . " He stooped over him to loosen his bonds , and was spat at for his pains . " You  --  you I remember now ! " He spoke the sothran tongue quite clearly , as if he had been taught . " Many years , but I forget not . . . Brat the great shaman took . . . . " He leered horribly , and his breathp157wheezed in his throat . " Should  --  have slain you then , eaten your liver  --  and him also , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , me and my clan ! " " What , " said Kermorvan in grim perplexity , " just by sparing this one 's life ? " " No , fool ! " gasped the old man . He seemed to seethe with his grievance , and be only too willing to spit the venom of it at any who would listen . " Great warrior , even you will learn ! Face him , and learn . . . I am no fool ! Would not have come south so far , so soon , but at his behest ! Foolish counsel , while so much fat on bones of Northland ! Too far , too soon , too little force ... " " Then why did you obey this man 's behest ? " asked Kermorvan quietly , kneeling down beside him . " Is he of a powerful clan ? " " Clans ! " The laugh was like nails scratched on slate . " He destroys clans  --  lowers chieftains  --  brings old ways of Aika ' iya-wahsa down ! Would have us unite with Otter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the force of many , like the Ice . . . Some will do it  --  I say never , many I speak for  --  till he wields his power , and then all is night , the heads bow before him . . . Fear none dare resist . . . Blade that never strikes a blow . . . My curse upon it , and the curses of all the ancestors of my clan , upon him , upon you , filth that you are  --  dung of the dog , beach carrion , couplers with animals  --  Maiyehsa ' sekaw'hai . . . " The chieftain 's voice cackled and crowed away into mumblings in his own tongue . " Where was your fleet headed next ? " demanded Kermorvan . " Straight for home ? " But the chief refused to speak any but his own tongue , even with Kermorvan 's sword at his throat , though he still stared around at them all with quick turns of the head and fierce yellow eyes , exactly like an ancient buzzard . He had had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked a question . " Pain will not move this one ! " said Kermorvan at last . " Better make an end of it now . Elof , you have no more to ask of this old serpent  --  Elof ? " Elof heard him , but he had sunk down in a heap on the deck . " What 's the matter with you ? " barked Kermorvan . " You heard him ! " whispered Elof , clutching handfuls of empty air . " The man , the great shaman  --  fear none dare resist  --  bladep158that never strikes a blow  --  Kermorvan , he was my master ! And it was I made that blade ! " The old chieftain heard and understood , for his cackling laughter rang high in the air . " Then may your own work skewer you ! May the breasts of your daughters fill our cooking pots  --  " But Kermorvan was not a man to be trifled with . In a fury of loathing he spun round , and Elof heard the whistle and thud of the swordblade as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter shrieked away into a whistling , gurgling scream and was still . The women heard also , and raised a great clamoring cheer , and one voice shouted , " He did n't die easy ! " " Throw that offal over the rail ! " barked Kermorvan , and he stooped to Elof and raised him up . " I do not understand all I heard , but obviously you do . You will tell me more later , when we can be apart . But I say this for now , I see no great evil in you . If something you have made finds an ill purpose  --  well , who better to unmake it ? Think on that ! " It was two evenings after the attack that they wearily turned their bows in between the high cliffs of the northern cove , hauled its bows high onto the silvery sand and sank down in utter relief . They built a great fire then , for the cliffs would hide the smoke , and the weary corsair crew slept while the women cooked food and mulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ate and drank , the women with them , and their mood grew riotous . Elof , who would have sat apart , they embraced as a brother , and plyed him with wine , praising his courage and great strokes that had cleared their way . He was the youngest of the crew , and well favored , and the women also made much of him , the younger ones fluttering around his neck or drawing him into the boisterous dancing around the fire . And he was nothing loth , for the wine had drowned his darker thoughts , and all his life he had known little of women . Kara 's face danced before him a moment in the flames , but the arms round his neck he could feel , the lips against his own were warm , if not so fair , the bodies in his arms were firm , if not so slender . The fumes of the warm wine clouded his mind like breath on glass ; he reeled , and two girls bore him up , one thin and redheaded , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise . Wine held the whole camp in its grip , a potent wall againstp159the terrors of the last days , and in its turn invoked a higher defense and refuge ; the corsairs knew few restraints , the women had all but lost theirs in the shock of battle and abduction . Soon bodies lay sprawled across the warm sand , writhing in a different dance , blind to all except inner need . Elof staggered and reeled between the girls , giggling and breathless with excitement ; they stumbled away up the beach to a shallow little cave between the cliffroots , and sank down gratefully on the dry sand of its floor . There clothes , torn and befouled by death in many forms , fell away , leaving only living flesh and blood yet flowing , and no barrier between them . Darkness and oblivion rushed in his veins , roared in his head , till all he knew of was the warm flesh enfolding him , the soft damp skin that trembledand fluttered against his body , the breasts pressed flat against him or hanging like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to another , taking and giving an animal comfort that blotted out all else ; and yet as breath grew fast and shallow , as the fire roared , blazed , to its height and the hammerstroke struck searing sparks to weld the linked bodies rigid , it was Kara he saw , Kara he held , Kara was the vision in flames within , that consumed him in an instant to darkly glowing embers , and in the last to sleep . He woke before dawn , slipped out from between the girls , coveringthem with their clothes , and staggered down to the beach to bathe . The shock of the cold water revived him , and he came out feeling cleansed inside and out , but mortally chill and hungry . He dressed in such of his clothes as he could still bear to wear , found others among the booty , and wine , bread and meat among the remains of the orgy . As he strode back along the beach he came upon Kermorvan , sitting with his back to a rock and throwing pebbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't see you enjoying yourself last night ! " Kermorvan gazed up at Elof with bleak eyes . " Enjoying myself ? In that ? " The weight of bitterness in his voice startled the smith . " What ails the great warrior , then ? Do you not like girls ? " " Of course ! " said Kermorvan indignantly . " But not like that ! " " Well , how , then ? " demanded Elof , more than a little nettled . " At your sword 's point ? " In a flash Kermorvan was on his feet , his pale eyes glaring downp160into Elof 's and his fist bunched in the smith 's jerkin . " I was not raised to suffer any taunt lightly ! Be glad it is untrue , or I might find pleasure in proving it on your hide . " " Well ? You scorn me freely enough ! Were you raised to do that ? Where 's the harm in all that went on , rough-grained though it be ? I saw nobody taken against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profanes something sacred . . . Something vital between a man and a woman that ought to be theirs alone  --  respect , regard , cherishing . . . Out on the sand like lust-ridden animals  --  but I am sorry I insulted you , smith . It is simply that you do not understand . " " What makes you so sure of that ? " inquired Elof drily . " I may be village-bred , but I love . I shall cherish her all my life , if I can only find her again . But she and I , we both inhabit bodies , they will have their needs . And those needs may be overwhelming , warrior . Especially in the face of what we lived through yesterday . " He looked at the lines on the tall man 's face , the shadows under his eyes . " You slept poorly last night , I would guess , if at all . But I slept , though I have seen less slaughter than you in the world . " " Aye , " sighed the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear you and I may live to see more . Forget my harsh words , if you can , for you may well be wiser than I. But tell me , you who were villagebred , you who were taken by this great shaman  --  what have you seen , in your time ? What is this thing you made , this blade ? Tell me , if you will , for I fear it concerns all who oppose the Ekwesh , and perhaps also the Ice . " Elof studied the face before him , eager yet anxious , with the bright , direct eyes of an eagle . How much would he understand of what must be told ? This man of justice , would he understand mercy ? But he was right , inescapably right . Told it must be , and at whatever cost . " Mylio ! " was the swordsman 's first reaction . " That name is of my people , but there is nothing else good of it . It was borne by nobles of the old north , some of whom yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's day , I think . A scholar , but a wicked , ambitious man who maltreated his peasants beyond bearing . Is this his son ? "  | " Maybe . Or the man himself . There were treatises on the extendingof life in his library  --  all on the forbidden wall . " Kermorvan 's brow darkened with sudden distrust . " Dark arts ! I have never believed in them , not truly , but . . . But you have studied them . " " I have , " said Elof steadily . " Hear me out . " Kermorvan nodded , acknowledging that that was just . He hung on every word , choking back the hundred questions that hovered on his lips , until Elof told of the night-shapes , of the bell and the strange warrior-party whose coming it had heralded . " Kerys ! " breathed the warrior . " Duergar  --  it could only be . . . The cut trees also , and the mineworkings . That explains much , very much . " " D-Duergar ? " asked Elof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost laughing . " He walks among marvels , and does not know them ! You have never heard of the Elders , the mountain-folk ? Why , they  --  but go on , finish your story . " Elof shrugged , and told of the sword 's power unleashed , his warningand his strange escape . " So you see , we had been carried , somehow , further and faster than a horse could have borne us , to an easy path down . " Kermorvan nodded . " You were taken by secret ways through the mountains , not over them . Naturally that was faster . But go on . " His face was sympathetic as Elof told of their troubled wanderings , his loss , and his decision to seek healing in the Marshlands . Kermorvanstared with greater wonder at the sword when told of its origins , but kept silent . It was only when Elof told of the strange rider that he sat up sharply , as if arrow-struck . " Raven ! You 've seen Raven ! " " I 've seen many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean the man , the . . . " He swallowed , and looked wildly around him . " Your visitor ! You . . . " He shook his head violently . " You do n't believe me , I see , " said Elof sharply . " Well , I can not prove it . But who is this Raven character anyhow ? I could use a word or two with him  --  " Kermorvan was making undignified stuttering sounds . " Oh , I believe you , " he managed to say at last . " You would not say anythingp162so ridiculous if it were not the truth ! But suppose I said I saw the maiden Saithana swimming up to join us here ? Eh ? Because it 's about as likely ! " " What d' you mean ? " cried Elof . " I mean , you smith of strange marvels  --  " But then he shook his head , and looked around uneasily . " I can not say . I have to think .. . Later , not now . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to know what to do , now ! You see what I have unleashed ! " Kermorvan visibly gathered his wits , and considered . " Yes . And I can find some counsel in what you have told me . What can be made , as I said , can be unmade . Or it can be countered . Make some other weapon , since this peculiar power of yours is with you once more , and go up against it . " " But how ? " breathed Elof , " I lack the knowledge  --  " " Which your former master has . A problem , yes . But do you not see that he also lacks something ? The power ! The art , or whatever you call it , or he would have made such a terrible thing himself , and never have entrusted it to an apprentice . Perhaps he did not expect it to come so powerful from your hands  --  but I wonder .. . That absence of his was so convenient ; he may have been tempting you , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seed of that betrayal of your fellow apprentice in your mind , which would lift some of it from you . But whatever the reason , you have one great comfort , evidently  --  in this strange art of yours , you are more potent than he ! " Elof sat gaping like an idiot , as the clear cold voice hammered home its truths . Waves washed through him as they fell against the beach , and he felt something burgeon within him , rising from toe tip to the roots of his hair , so that it bristled and rose . His hand sank to the goad at his belt , closed around characters he had remembered . " Yes ! " he breathed . " It must be so ! He knew . . . " " So ! Then your problem is simple . Find yourself a better master , and learn what you need from him . " " But who ? Most mastersmiths would have no truck with a vagrant like me  --  except old Hjoran , and he knows nothing of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters among men , maybe  --  but there are others . " " Others ? " " Aye , or a childhood fable . Again , your master has kept you ignorant of what might serve you in the world . For it has long been said that in the high mountains bordering both Northland and Southland dwell the Elder folk , the stunted ones that in your northern tongue are named the duergar . " " In my tongue ? " asked Elof , " But before you used it , I never heard the name , not even as a childhood tale . Though I was not told many tales . . . no , not even then . " " Yet it is known even in our poor cloistered Southlands , where no legends ride abroad to smithy doors . In the wild lands on our inland marches , under the shadow of the mountains and the Great Forest , only a few dwell , hillmen and hunters  --  simple at best , more often cloven in mind . Some claim to have occasional meetings on the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revere them more than their own civilized lords . " He shook his head . " It is said they are the greatest masters of smithcraft , and once taught our ancestors . It is said also that seeking them out is deadly peril . " He sighed . " But our need is great . And you who are so powerful a smith might find welcome among them , for they are clearly no friends of the man you seek to counter , and once you saved them from him . Most important of all , you know what no others seem to  --  a region where they may actually dwell . " " I do , " mused Elof . " Though the aid I gave them is paid , surely , and it would be a long and dangerous journey alone ... " " So it would . But you need not go alone . I will come with you  --  if , after all I have said , you can tolerate me . " " Tolerate you ? " Elof looked askance at the tall young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and concentration . He thought of a flying leap between ships in poor light , in armor that would drag a man down living into Amicac 's jaws if he so much as slipped , all to save lives among his crew . " But you have a purpose here , among the corsairs  --  " " My purpose is fighting the Ekwesh . That tore me from my home , and what shreds of prosperity and influence I yet enjoyed . I hadp164hoped to lead this ship in time , to buy and recruit others and weld them into a real shielding force . But last night I saw finally that for all that butcher 's work , all the lives lost , I had hardly scratched the surface of their armor ! One ship  --  a thirtieth part of a tenth part of their present fleet , and that barely a tenth of what their force might be , if they are united under one banner ! That above all I must fight . And I do firmly believe that you have been sent to me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I must not fail it , or you . I ask again , will you go with me ? " " How old are you , Kermorvan ? " " Twenty-five years . " " You look older . I am only twenty , twenty-one at most , and hardly fit , it seems , to be running loose in this world . If you will tolerate me  --  why then , I 'll go with you gladly . "  | " A dark prospect , and a long journeyon two feet , " said Kermorvan , as he surveyed the evening landscape spread out before them . Below the hillcrest on which they stood the country fell away to great stretches of tangled woodlandand empty plain , without sign of life or habitation ; the wind howled across them unhindered . Only on the far horizon could the jagged peaks of mountains be made out , sullen and shadowed below an angry sunset . Never once , though , did he turn and look back to the hills through which they had come , and the bay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away at once , before the corsairs awoke . " Or they may try to prevent us . They might even be foolish enough to try main force . " He smiled . " Though I doubt if they could stand against you and I together . " " But . . . you do n't think you 're deserting them ? " " With so much loot ? The rascals are richer now than they deserve to be , through me . And by returning these women they can buy off their outlawry and be quit , if they are wise . No , I owe them nothing  --  though I agree they might not see it in that fashion ! So let us be gone ! " Thus they had hastily gathered gear and food together , and madep166their way out of the inlet and along the sandy shore of the bay to where its cliffs could more easily be climbed . Kermorvan , in addition to the single-handed sword he usually wore , bore a heavy pack that Elof guessed contained his war gear , but it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rock with an ease the smith 's shorter limbs could not match . Through the rolling hills beyond , Kermorvan kept up a punishing pace , and stopped only as the sun fell toward the distant peaks . " You see , " he pointed out , " our search took us north of theii marshes into the Debatable Lands  --  there they lie , that dark and hazy expanse ! To the northeast there , already in the long mountainshadow , is the southward way you and your friend took . " Elof thought of Roc , as he often did , and wondered how he had faredamong people . his own What would he make of this strange char- acter , this corsair with lordly manners ? They had one thing in common , beyond doubt , and that was a kinder heart than their outward selves suggested . " We , though , must seek a quicker way north , " Kermorvan added . " Even if it is a whit more dangerous . So we will follow the High roads that run by the coast at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His look grew remote , as if he strove to see further than the eye alone could reach . " I will be glad to see them again , those mountains , " he sighed . " They are noble places on their lower slopes , with green woodland and many fair lakes , and the heights had great majesty . I often wished to go higher , but deemed it rash to brave the Ice all alone . And now you , 11 tell me you lived there many a long year ! " " In a high house , and no doubt well fortified in more ways than one . But I did n't know you knew the mountains , Kermorvan ! You 're no northerner , are you ? " " Not I ! " he said , laughing . " But when I left my home in the Southlands a few years past I traveled north with some merchants , for a brief season . I journeyed south again down the coast ways , and know something therefore of their broils and pitfalls  --  though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was I saw clear proof what the Ekwesh were about , and grew less blinkered than most of my kin . The little towns raided , they wounded my heart  --  the rooftreesyet smoldering , the fields laid barren , the bones of their de/fenders left to the sky to mourn and the scavenging beasts to bury . " Elof nodded . " Perhaps you saw Asenby , where I grew up , left so some seven springtimes gone . " " I saw many such , and no one living to tell me their name . One looks much like another . Come ! We have a long road ahead of us , the more we manage the lighter the morrow ! " " It 's almost dark ... " " So it is . But would you sleep out on a barren hillside , when there is a fine firwood downhill , with branches to make a good shelter ? I 'll show you how . Come ! " And thus it was throughout most of the days that followed , with Kermorvan very much the leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sothran knew the way well , and was moreover a practiced woodsman and accomplished trapper and hunter . Elof thought how much more comfortable such skills would have made him and Roc on their wanderings , and strove to learn from him . That first night a few lopped fir sprays became a welcome roof against the trunk of a great tree . " The art , " Kermorvan remarked as he wrapped himself in his great cloak of dark green , " is to make the roof steep enough to spill off rain , but not so high that the warmth of your body goes to heat a great pool of air overhead . " He pillowed his head on his bundle , and muttered a curse as it clanked . " Not as snug as your smithy , perhaps , but it will serve . " My smithy ! Suddenly a great longing for it flooded over Elof , an overwhelming homesickness . For squalid as it was , it was the only home he had made himself , and he missed the security and peace he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . His precious tools still hung there , if they had not been stolen . Why had it all been wrested away from him ? Why should he not simply make his way back there , do what he could , serve in his way ? These duergar creatures  --  how human could they be , dwelling beneath the mountains ? What did they live on ? They had looked human enough , in their way  --  but strong and dangerous also , having little in common with ordinary human beings . Even the Mastersmith had feared them , till he had the sword . Seeking them out  --  a mad idea , forced on him like all the rest . . . He tossed and turned in a fit of resentment , hearing the pine needles whisper vague secretsp168beneath him . Why ? And by whom ? What power , what arrogance ? He ground his teeth at the memory of that mocking smile , and glared at Kermorvan . In the morning that one would tell what he knew of Raven , if it had to be wrung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He did drowse at last , lulled by the rush of the wind in the pines overhead and their heavy fragrance , undisturbed by the owls that came to perch on them and the scurrying of small things among the pine needles . He woke only once , with a full moon in his face , and peeped out between the branches to see wide white wings flash across its disc , once , and vanish . He sank back into sleep , and dreamed of Kara . Next day , as they marched down out of the woods and out onto heathlands , he found Kermorvan still strangely unwilling to talk outright about the dark visitor . " Somebody once told you ! " " I was not under his eye , then ! " " And I am ? Then so are you , as long as we 're together . I 'd better know something of him for my own protection , had n't I ? " " Protection ? " Kermorvan sounded puzzled . " Raven is not evil . Or , I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a givenname ; I have heard many others  --  Wanderer , Hooded Man , Father of Storm , Lord of the Battlefield . I know not which , if any , is truly his own . Such a power is not so easily confined within a single name . " " A power ? A lord of the Ice ? " " Did I not say there were others ? Powers that defend life as the Ice seeks to destroy it ? Though which of the two is stronger , or whether they are equal , or whether both serve a greater power yet , no one can agree . But such powers there are , and my people have long revered them  --  too long , perhaps , for they have faded into half-truth and legend , figures on walls and banners , half-rememberedsongs , no more . Saithana , if truly she exists , may be one . But Raven certainly is ! For know , smith , that you shod the steed of a great power that night . If you like , a god ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But then . . . if this is as you say , and it makes my head whirl worse than the wine , he did indeed bring me to meet you . . . for what purpose ? "  |p169Kermorvan  shrugged . " Who can say ? But purpose there was , and we are working it out with every stride we take . Do you see now why I have not cared to think too heavily about this ? Every choice I make , every decision , affects our cause in many subtle ways . And not necessarily for the best ! The Raven is not evil , but he does not take sides , they say . He is the defender of life , in all its forms , and human life most of all . He is , or was once , a great sign among us , but I have also heard that he is yet respected , at least , by many of the Ekwesh . " He walked on a long way , letting Elof digest that . " And even if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help we would wish . For he is an enemy to sluggish stagnation , it is said , and favors change and growth even at the cost of strife . He will not allow men to become dependent on him , save perhaps to balance the enmity of the Ice . So he will stir their affairs about in strange and willful ways , in the guise of a trickster  --  as you have found ! " At length Elof said , " Now I come to understand much , and a wider world opens before me . But it is a confused one , and even more dangerous than I had thought it  --  not merely full of ordinary and unconnected dangers , but a very battleground of forces ! Small wonder the Mastersmith denied me such knowledge , he who serves the Ice , seeking to turn me down its paths for his own purposes . But I remember nothing of such lore even from my far childhood in Asenby . " " Aye , such things came to be little thought of there , as the high wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to the harvests of soil and sea . Perhaps this secretive smithcraft of yours helped that dwindling , hoarding knowledge as its wealth , away from the common run of folk . That was one reason I never consideredit more than a mere superstition , when first I met it . Now ... " He gestured helplessly . " A wider world has opened to me also , and every bit as confusing . I held the view of most educated men  --  among my people , that is  --  believing the powers were something remote and impersonal , guiding our affairs from afar . I held tales of their appearance in human form parables at best , and at worst lies to the credulous . How after all could some such airy being don a human frame , like a cloak ? " " He seemed solid enough to me , that Raven ! " said Elof sourly.  | " And that damned great beast he rode ! Or was everything illusion ? " " Perhaps not , " mused Kermorvan . " I always found tales of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less dignified behavior , absurd or blasphemous . But I remember reading one philosopher who purported to explain them by holding that the powers assumed human form the better to understand us and influenceus  --  sharing the ordinary joys and pains , strengths and hindrances of our bodies , and cloaking much of their awe and might . Another held that they could only affect this material world directly by taking some solid form in it , and that that form was more or less fixed , reflecting their absolute natures . You may guess I thought this feeble stuff then . But now ... " He shrugged eloquently . " I am baffled . And that is not something I will ever readily admit . " " But the horse rode faster than any normal horse might , " said Elof thoughtfully . " Or so it seemed . . . " And so they made their way up through the wild country , talking and disputing , marveling at each other 's wholly different brand of learning . At day 's end they often found it had lightened their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that first day they neared the margins of the Debatable Lands , and at the next day 's dawning the High roads of the coast were already in sight . " I have a little money , " said Kermorvan thoughtfully . " Enough , maybe , for a couple of horses , when we come to somewhere that will sell them . " " Might it not be better kept for food ? " asked Elof . " No , I think not . Speed will help us , at least for a time . If pressed , we can always sell the horses again . Or eat them , " he added thoughtfully . Elof grimaced . But it was long before they found anywhere to buy food or horses , for the first small town they came to along the roads lay in ruins , and the next also , and the next . They might perhaps have found some stored food the fire had missed , but neither man could bring himself to search . It had all happened some months since , but the stench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unburied skulls still grinned among the fireweed in the blackened fields . These towns had lain between the roads and the sea ; the next , Randeby , was inland , and built around a high bluff , and it stood , after a fashion ,  |p171having  driven- off a heavy attack with loss . But there the fugitives from the other towns had come , eating up the already scant supplies . Famine and pestilence hung over its walls , and gaunt-cheeked men and women encamped at its gates swooped down on the travelers with savage shouts the moment they were seen . Kermorvan had to fell three to drive them off , and for all the rest of that day he was silent . " Human wolves ! " he said at last . " Poor creatures ! For the last small coin in our purses , or crust in our satchels . " " Or even the flesh on our bones , " said Elof dourly . " So I read their taunts . Thus the Ekwesh drag us down to their level . " " And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I will not risk staying to teach them the skill . " He gave a wry laugh . " The Raven may have been kinder than you knew . There will be little enough traffic moving on the roads this year , even inland , if this is the rule . " Elof nodded . " I might have starved even as they do . I wish I could help them ! " " Rid them of the Ekwesh , then . For without that all lesser help is meaningless . " They slept in trees that night , and after , to put off any pursuers . But the day after that , as the road curved well away from the sea , they came to Tensborg , another and much larger town that had not been attacked or overwhelmed by fugitives , and found that though there was little food to spare there were horses in plenty , kept for the sothran traders who had not yet come this year . They bought two decent mounts at small cost , and thereafter made good time northward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast , seeing the northern countryside alter gradually around them . As the roads turned inland , skirting a hilly region , they entered a changing woodland . The high redwoods and bristlecone pines became fewer ; hemlocks , oaks , firs and spruces took their places , and the smaller dawn redwoods . The undergrowth , too , grew thinner ; the high sword ferns disappeared , the anemones and rose rhododendrons , with their brilliant blooms , became gradually smaller and paler and finally all but vanished . But as the roads neared the sea once more , the woodlands themselves vanished among low hills topped with scrubby grass , and in the dunes only verbenap172and sea lavender showed bright . It was around the sea 's margin that they saw yet more of the havoc the Ekwesh wrought among the little towns . " Always by the sea ! " said Kermorvan coldly . " For the Ekwesh are not great horsemen , and have not mastered the act of fighting on horseback  --  you need proper stirrups for that ! So they bring no horses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest they be cut off . " Elof looked to the east , where rolling hills rich with grass and little patches of woodland stretched away into the dim distance . This was the country he had grown up in ; he could not be so very far south of Asenby here . Yet it felt not in the least like home .. . " So the inland towns are safe ? " " No ! Though they think they are , here and in the south . When those barbarians meet no resistance they will surely move further and further from their ships , bring or capture horses  --  oh , I have tried to tell so many men that , traders and farmers and fat little burgesses . And where has it got me ? They do n't want to believe ! The Ekwesh are another man 's problem , never theirs . " " But if it is the Mastersmith who drives them on , then besting him  --  " The swordsman shook his head . " It may save the situation for a while , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his masters have already prepared , long before you forged that blade . Without him the Ekwesh would simply go on as they have been doing , and sooner or later they would have struck at the south . Other , stronger forces drive their empire on , and whether it is in our or any man 's hands to best them , I do not know . " At length they came to a region where high hills and deep inlets blocked the coast way , and the roads turned away inland . Here they were in much worse repair , and the going was slower ; it was weeks more before the travelers reached the feet of the mountains , and high summer blazed down upon them . It was the best and safest time to venture into the mountains , but as they did not mean to go by the well-trodden roads , or stay within the usual passes , the horses would be no use . They sold them at a little town Elof remembered from his first wanderings as reasonably honest , and with the proceeds bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatp173with the town smith for metal and the use of the forge . He took two strong staves and shod them with metal spikes and heavy beaked heads so well crafted that the smith suspected a plan to discredit him , and had to be persuaded otherwise at the point of Elofs blade . " At least that master of mine gave me some skill in the mountains ! Picks like these may save our lives on the high slopes . " Kermorvan cocked an eyebrow at the fuming smith . " Then let us put them to the test at once ! There is no safe bed for us here now , in any case . The mountains must provide ! " They slept that night in a small wood as they often did , a league or so above the town . But just as the moon was sinking they were rudely awakened by a sharp scuffling at their roof of branches , and springing up they found themselves face to muzzle with a vast bear . It sprang back at their sudden yells , and they had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared up on its hind legs , twice as tall as Kermorvan , and cuffed its huge paws at them . The swordsman grabbed his pack and drew out his mailcoat , trailing it like a net ready to tangle its claws . But seeing them stand their ground the bear ducked down with a gruff snort and went crashing off into the wood . Kermorvan shivered . " I thought we would be safe , as we have been till now . Most beasts will flee a sleeping man , or ignore him . " " Indeed , " mused Elof . " The smaller bears may be savage on occasion , but the giant breed who winter in the caves rarely eat meat , even carrion . What made him so aggressive ? " " Bears were ever fickle in their ways , " shrugged Kermorvan . " Well , let us rebuild our shelter , and take turns on watch . I will take first turn , till moonset . " Elof nodded , but was silent . It seemed strange to him , that attack , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rolled in his cloak , now cool and unwelcoming , and did his best to sleep . But all through the next days , as they climbed through the steep hillside forests , the image of illness kept coming back to him , in the blighted trees , the weird phosphorescent fungus growths on the dead stumps , the huge patches of poison ivy that seemed to spring up at every turn . Vines and parasites trailed rootlets round their necks , creepers caught their ankles , thorns snagged their clothesp174and pricked their skins . Things of small moment , perhaps , but they were matched by the behavior of the beasts . More than once the travelers had to leap back as bronzen snakes struck rattling at their legs instead of slithering to escape . Kermorvan , gazing up at a strange sound in a twilit tree , almost lost an eye to a great horned owl that swooped upon him and was only with difficulty thrashed away . In the heat of the noon , flies came droning down the slanting sunbeams and would not let them rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whining cloud . All usual enough in woodlands , but not in such intensity . It seemed to Elof that some change , subtle and sinister , was taking place in the woodlands he had once roamed through on the Mastersmith 's expeditions . All too often the blood-freezing yell of a hunting daggertooth would send them hurrying on with drawn swords . " How many of the brutes can there be ? " panted Kermorvan . " So many in this small area would surely strip it of game in a week ! Or is one persistent animal hunting us ? " Elof shrugged . They slept in a tree that night , lashing themselves to the boughs with the morse-hide ropes they had brought from the ship . Elof lay awake long on his perch , though it was not too uncomfortable , staring up at the pale glimmer over the mountains , at the edge of the night . He thought of the pent-up power it reflected . Was the spreading sickness , the new hostility of the wood , yet another kind of reflection ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked away . But before he was wholly asleep he heard a soft pattering on the leaves over his head , and great round drops came trickling down onto his face . He groaned , but there was no risking a shelter on the ground now ; he would have to suffer the rain where he was . The lower woodlands were hard enough to endure , but as they neared the higher slopes worse was to come . They had long since exhausted the food they carried , and it was chiefly Kermorvan 's skill at trapping that kept them alive ; they could find little enough game to hunt . " I almost wish that daggertooth would come after us now ! " muttered Elof , worrying at the flesh of a small shrew-thing . " We might see what his steaks taste like ! " 41 He could hardly be any tougher , " agreed Kermorvan , thrustingp175his portion back over the little fire to cook further . Then he sprang to his feet , overturning the meat , stamped the flames to embers and whipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What moves ? " Faintly Elof heard it at first , a low soft crackle , the sudden burst of a dead branch on the forest floor , bushes rustling as they were thrust aside . Something was moving indeed in the twilight , somethingslow but heavy . And yet there seemed to be no rhythm in thesound , no separate footfalls . " It 's ... slithering ... " he whispered . " Aye ... " muttered Kermorvan , and then suddenly he thrust himself sideways into Elof , slamming them both into the weeds behind the bole of a great tree . " Climb ! " he hissed , and sprang for a lower branch , while Elof was still trying to collect his wits . Kermorvansaw him stagger up , and swung back down to reach out a hand , just in time . There was a sudden loud smashing in the bushes , and with a rush something huge came sliding and slithering into the little ring of bushes . Gasping , they hung there in the tree , Elof slung precariously between the branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not see what had come at them , until there was a loud rasping sniff and it moved forward . Then a great dark flank slid into view . It rested on the ground like a serpent , but it was larger by far than any serpent they had ever seen , and a short stubby leg protruded from it . A long-clawed foot crunched down on the embers of their fire , and there was another loud sniffing sound , a rustle as of scaly skin , a waft of putrid , musky stench . Elof s blood ran cold , but his curiosity , as ever , overran it . Detaching himself from Kermorvan 's unwavering grip , he leaned forward , trying to make out what manner of beast it could be . But unfortunately , perhaps , it was facing away from them , and he saw only a thick hind leg , some twelve feet behind the foreleg . Just in front of it lay their packs , with so many things they could not spareElof swung down on the branch , and hung an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked forward , and dropped light as a feather on a bare patch of pine needles , muffling his footfall . He bent , scooped up the packs , praying Kermorvan 's would not clank again , and flung himself into the weeds as the dark flank heaved and the leg thrust out . But the thing had not noticed him.  |p176In  another wave of stench it slithered slowly forward , almost rowing itself along with its short legs , and went snaking off downhill . But it was a long time after the sound died away before either man dared move . Kermorvan swung himself down nimbly . " Kerys ! That was bravely done , my smith ! What in the world was it ? " " Do n't look at me for an answer ! A dragon , perhaps ? " " I think not . I remember dragons on old tapestries in our house , made by people who knew them only too well , and none looked like that . Besides , that seemed a very beast , a stupid one , and dragons are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall lizard  --  a quick rush , then rest . " " A lizard halfway to a snake , then , and as big around as a horse . I have never seen or heard of anything such in these woods . " " Then I 'll wager it 's something off the Ice , some beast let loose to wreak havoc in its vanguard . Faugh ! The foulness of it ! Let 's be far from here , for our dinner 's ended for tonight . " There were other encounters before they left the woods , though none so close or fearful . Once as they made ready to sleep they saw something dimly phosphorescent go hopping along between the tree trunks below , and where it went even the faint night murmurs fell silent . And later , as they were casting about for a way out to the slopes above , something came crashing and blundering across the path they had taken , away downhill ; they could not see it , but from the threshing of the bushes it might be a man , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they cut their way through onto the stony slopes with as little ado as possible . " And yet here is no refuge , " said Elof as they toiled up the rough hillside , the rock 's bare bones showing between the thin coating of topsoil , scrubgrass and stunted shrubs . " For I remember this place , and we are now no more than a day or so south of the pass above the Mastersmith 's house , and that means we take care ; in clear weather he was often abroad . North of that , beyond his valley , he never took us ; there the Ice thrusts glaciers deep among the mountains . Where those duergar creatures left us , that lies eastward around those peaks there , about two days ' walk . That seems as good a place as any to search . "  | " Then we will climb to just below the snow line , " said Kermorvan , " and make our way round . " Before long even the last traces of green died away beneath their feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were marching along great ridges of solid rock , or slipping and slithering across wide swaths of loose rock and scree , or scrambling up piled boulders . The wind had a bite to it now to match its howl , pressing their cloaks flat , plucking at their bags , lashing their faces till eyes grew gritty and nostrils burned . It was mustering the gray clouds like an army , piling them up in ranks around the northward peaks ; Kermorvan looked up at them anxiously . He dragged out a scarf as long as his arms , and was binding it round his face when he realized Elof had none ; at once he sliced it neatly on his half-drawn blade and handed over the remainder . Elof took it with a sober nod of thanks , for he could think of nothing to say . But at last , late in the second day , they rounded the peak into the lee . Wind still eddied around them , but with less force , and they took a moment to rest . Elof looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of a strange freedom . There were the lakes , the woods , but no longer as friendly as they had seemed . The bleak gray light did not help . He turned away to the ridge above . " Beyond there lie the glaciers . The duergars can not have gone that way . It must have been somewhere on this slope they vanished . Or appeared to . It was dark , and they had the only lanterns . " Kermorvan kicked at a hefty boulder . " I did not realize the lee was quite so close . That bodes ill . If they do have a door or gate here , something that could make that deep sound you heard , they will have disguised it with all their skill  --  too much , perhaps , for us . But we will search , all the same . " He looked up at the sky again , the mustering of the clouds . " Let us hope we find it soon . For in these high places , even at this season , such a sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toiled up to the ridge , weary , chill and sick at heart . They had quartered the whole wide slope between them , and found no single boulder , no crack in the steep rock walls , no break in the scree , which seemed anything but natural . Only the very summit of the ridge remained , and it looked too bare top178hide even a rathole , scoured flat by the relentless north wind . Beyond it , too , the stark glow seemed stronger than ever against the gray clouds , and shone like a warning even on the brief mist of their breath . This too may be frozen ... . Kermorvan , as usual , reached the rim a little ahead . And there Elof feared for him , for he saw the swordsman halt in his tracks , silhouetted against the glare , stand staring a moment and sink very slowly to one knee . Elof sprang to catch up , and himself came reckless over the rise , and stood transfixed at the sight spread out before him . They had come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep walled gouge like a swordblow among the peaks . Somewhere in his dazed mind Elof realized it must be directly opposite the Mastersmith 's valley , stemming from the far slopes of the same peak . But that side was merely barren and cold . This side was in the grip of the Ice . So it was that Elof first beheld the great Adversary , and he also sank down , daunted . It was a sight of awe and wonder , and what he had least of all expected , it was beautiful , so fair the marvel of it awoke coursing ice in his very veins . Far out into the distance below him stretched the glacier , infinitely far along the widening valley between dwindling peaks and out onto a vast expanse of softly glowing gray-white . The eastern walls of the mountains sank into it as if into a sea , overwhelmed ; here and there , as if in mockery of former majesties , a remote peak protruded , blunted and crumblinglike a slighted fortress . Beyond these pathetic remnants it stretched out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on it and blurred painfully , finding no hold or reference . Even a horizon seemed to be lacking , perhaps because there were gray clouds there to merge with it . Whatever the truth of it , the sight filled Elof with the sudden chill feeling that he , that the whole warmly living world of earth and flowers and beasts and men and women were nothing but a very thin crust of dirt upon an infinity of cool sterile whiteness , a smear of filth on the chill beauty of a gem , at the mercy of its slightest movement or disturbance , utterly insignificant . Even when he shifted his gaze to the high peaks above him and across the valley , seeking comfort in their strength , they seemed things of slight and temporary moment , nop179more a barrier than their buried kin had been . It was simply a matter of time , and the Ice had already long spans of years frozen at its heart . What did man have ? Then suddenly he held his gaze , peering , questing into the gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind that whipped at him , shielding his eyes with his hand till he was sure of what he saw . He turned and found Kermorvan at his side . The swordsman 's face was pale and stern , full of awe and wonder , but no slightest trace of fear ; it was set like flint , and the gleam in his eyes as they scanned the endless distances was a challenge returned . " You saw something ? " " I ... think so ! Out across the valley , among the high peaks beyond the end of it , see ! See  --  " Kermorvan rubbed his eyes , peered and shook his head . Then he turned back , blinking , and looked at one peak again . " I see .. . the faintest of orange glows ... " " You do indeed ! " Kermorvan eyed him doubtfully . " It could be many things ... " " So it could . But do you see any more hopeful sign ? " Kermorvan shook his head grimly . " I do not , for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , let us be on our way , for it will be sore walking to bring us round all these mountains . " He swung his pack back onto his shoulders , and was about to set off down the slope again when Elof caught him by the arm . " Not that way , " he said . " We dare not go round , I know that part of the mountains only too well . We would have to risk crossing the Mastersmith 's road , and near his house ! " " Well then , what other way may we take ? " Elof bit his lip , and looked away , down into the valley far below . " There is only one . Across the Ice . " " What ! " Kermorvan clapped a hand to his sword . " I 'll take my chances with your accursed master  --  " Again Elof held him back , this time with real force . " You fool ! If he can compel the Ekwesh , could he not take you without a blow struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his will , and set you against all you now seek to preserve ! Is that the chance you prefer ? " Kermorvan stood angry and irresolute , looking down the slope top180the distant valley , and up toward the crest and the Iceglow . It was obvious which he preferred , but he could not escape the smith 's logic . " I said I would go with you , " he muttered . " Do not doubt me . But will we not be risking the same , or worse , upon the Ice ? " " It may not be so terrible , not here at its margins ! " insisted Elof . " You saw as I did , nothing moved in that valley , nothing stirred . And it is not wide , we could easily be across in a night if we hurry  --  " " A night  --  " began the swordsman , gazing back down the valley again , but then he caught Elof 's arm , and pointed . Far below , at the very margin of the nearest patch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough to make them rustle and quiver without showing itself . But then , as the bushes ended among high stones , it did emerge for an instant into the gleam of stars and Ice , slipping across an open patch to take cover behind a great jagged rock . It was man-shaped , but chillingly unlike a man , huge and heavier in the shoulders and high-crowned head , with long arms that swung at its side as it loped along . " Kerys ! " breathed the swordsman . " Think you that 's what was on our trail in the woods ? " " It moved in much the same fashion  --  but listen ! " A little way along the line of bushes something else was rustling its way forward , and there were other sounds from deeper in the wood , a soft guttural grunting . " A whole pack of them ! " said Elof quietly . " Well , warrior , are you still for going back that way ? " " Suddenly the Ice acquires a certain appeal , " admitted Kermorvandrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive us onto it ? " " Perhaps . But only at our last extremity , frightened , slow and unwilling . They might not expect a sudden bold dash ... " " I would not call twelve hours ' fast marching a dash , however bold . But you have the right of it , smith ! Lead on ! " Together they strode back up to the crest and , as lightly and quietly as possible , began to descend the far slope . " This is n't too hard ! " whispered Elof . " No more is the path to the River , they say , " countered Kermorvangloomily . " One way . "  | " Ach , save your encouragement for the Ice , we 'll surely need it there ! " Surprisingly , Kermorvan chuckled , and climbed with a lighter step thenceforward . At first sight , from high above , the distant Ice had looked glasssmoothand dazzling white , but as they clambered down the steep slopes the glacier that filled the valley seemed grayer and more marked . Elof could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only anything like white in the center ; along either edge ran great striations , almost as dark as the rock they clashed with . As they came closer these resolved into dark uneven ridges streaked along the surface of the Ice like sediment in a frozen river . " I have heard them talked of , " said Kermorvan , " and called moraines . They are made of rock and debris the Iee has ground away in its passage , freed when a little of the surface melts in warmer weather . No doubt many a proud mountaintop lies before you there . And they will not make our path any easier . " The moraines lay the length of the valley , but there were other , finer markings lying across the surface , crosshatched in places and deepened by long shadows . " They look like wrinkled skin , " said Elof . " Ancient skin , withered and grimy . And see there where the valley bends , they deepen and come together as they might at an elbow ! As if the glacier were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those would be crevasses , I fear , " said Kermorvan . " Thicker and deeper at the elbow , as you say . Let us keep well away from there ! They will be hard enough to avoid as it is ! " And indeed , when they at last drew near the margins of the glacier , Elof wondered if he had not led them astray , so rough did their way look , and so fearsome the moaning of the wind among the moraines . A frozen film , clear , hard and treacherous , lay over all the lower rocks , and slippery pockets of dirty snow lay frozen between the stones . One last step from the rim , he stumbled badly , almost fell , and halted , wavering . Then , cautiously , he took his first step onto the Great Ice . For a moment he thought crazily he was back in his forge , and had trodden on a hot iron coulter . The searing blaze in his worn boots was cold , not flame , but the sensation was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hopped with the agony ,  |p182scrambled  up onto some stones to find a moment 's relief , but it was as if ice was touched to his bare nerves . He hesitated , gasping , desperate to spring back to the rocks . A longer time he might have stood there , perhaps to his own destruction , had Kermorvan not plunged straight out among the frozen debris at the moraine 's edge without so much as breaking stride . That took away Elof 's choices ; he could only set his teeth in his lip , and stumble after . He was startled to see Kermorvan hurrying along , choosing his way carefully in the twilight , but swinging his pickstaff and bounding from stone to Ice and back again with all his usual energy . It struck Elof just how bold this man was , marching out to confront a thing that had probably been a childhood bogey , and in manhood had come to embody the powers he hated . There might be tremors in his mind , but in his stride none , nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slipped noisily down a high ridge in the uncertain dusk . By then , an hour on , numbness had dulled the pain enough to let Elof speak . " Do n't you feel it ? " Kermorvan crouched down beside him among the debris of shatteredrock . " Feel what ? " It was obvious he did not . Elof wondered , but did not explain . Kermorvan drew his cloak about him . " The wind , yes ! And cursedly exposed , out there in the open , with so much light around us . It might be harder going in the dark , but I would be less worried about unfriendly eyes . May those clouds come south before moonrise , and blot out the stars also ! " But he was not to have his wish , for though the clouds mounted into immense black ramparts on the northern horizon , the wind died , the chill air fell still and silent . The sky over the valley remainedopen and bitterly clear , and the stars as they came out looked down on their warped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air high overhead , as if a vast invisible curtain had been momentarily twitched across it from one horizon to the other . Kermorvan , rising to his feet , gasped and ducked down , and Elof beside him . A sound grew in the silence , a faint angry crackle at the edge of hearing . The curtain twitched again , this time a pale rippling flicker of reds and greens , growing ever more intense ; blues and purples shone only a second before the dark sky swallowed them . Pale yellow streaks of light arced acrossp183the darkness and diminished . A corona of cold fire , impossibly vast , rippled across the stars and shamed them , a vision of piercing splendor . " What sight is this ? " breathed the sothran , shielding his eyes . " The North Lights ! " whispered Elof , feasting his gaze . Another streak crossed behind them . " And a rain of starstones to go with them ! I have seen them before , but from a distance , and never so gigantic , never ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I know of , " answered the smith . " And yet .. . The Mastersmith did once say that they might herald some meeting of forces  --  what more , I ca n't imagine . " " A meeting ! " muttered Kermorvan grimly . " Then let us not be caught in the middle ! " Half-crouching , hiding from watchful eyes , they began to creep forward along the moraine until they were opposite the nearest part of the far slope . " Now there is nothing for it but the open , between the crevasses , " added the swordsman tautly . " And the longest part of our way . Come ! " And so they made their way across the whiter open area of the glacier , striding along broad ridges , creeping across narrower ones on all fours with deadened fingers that could barely grasp their staves , hearing little gouts of half-solid snow fall away from under their feet and go slipping down into the deep crevasses at either side . They landed with a soft echoing splash , suggesting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not soft snow . The cold fire overhead beat down on them , setting strange livid hues in their faces , lending shadows a faint flickering animation that made finding their footing doubly difficult , filling the distance with sinister promises of movement . Strange forms took shape and danced among the patches of clear ice ; once Elof seemed to see Kara 's face in the reflections , gazing at him in fear and warning , and later he saw Kermorvan rub his eyes and mutter , " The Cate ! The High Cate ... " No way among the crevasses was ever as clear as it had seemed at first , and they had to be forever spying out new ones . But these seemed always to drive them up the valley , away from the wall , and they became acutely aware that precious hours were passing . Kermorvan hugged chill hands ; Elof , scanning the open distancesp184of the valley , flexed his numbed limbs and remembered all he had heard of the dangers of frostburn . All of a sudden Kermorvan came to a halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the valley . Then he shook his head impatiently and was about to move on when Elof tugged him back . " No ! I see it too ! " With one accord they sank down in the soft snow of a low drift , and watched . A fleck of shadow seemed to detach itself from the far side of the valley and come gliding out across the black length of moraine , as smoothly as if it was a polished floor . With a slow bobbing movement the shadow drifted toward the clear center of the Ice , gliding over the crevasses as if they were not there . It had man 's shape , as an empty cloak left hanging has it , but drawn out , spider-thin and gray . Swiftly it advanced to the center and seemed to hang there , floating like a frond in a still pool , the high hood bobbing gently from side to side . Slowly it turned , the travelers ducked down , but it stopped and hung there swaying once again . It seemed to be facing southward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ice . Fearing to stir under the thin cloak of snow , Elof slowly turned his head and stared into the distance . For long minutes there was nothing , then he thought he saw a flicker of movement . It was like a shadow growing thicker , darker , coagulating into solid form . His scalp prickled . He was seeing something take shape there , out of the empty air , a figure forming on the Ice where an instant before there was nothing . It was there now , and coming forward . But it seemed small and clumsy , like an insect stumbling over rocks compared to the thing that hung there , not two thousand paces distant . He risked a glance at Kermorvan ; he also was looking south , and grimly . If they moved on , the cloaked thing might not spy them , but the newcomer surely would . They could only wait like stones , and hope to be taken for them . Slowly , awkwardly , the new figure approached with none of the other 's eerie grace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming carapace , like an insect 's head . It took Elof a moment to see it was human , and in fact striding over rough terrain with unusual ease . The shapelessness was a wide dark cloak or robe , the carapace a metal headpiece , a helm.  |p185Elof  choked . His heart faltered , then thundered against his ribs till it seemed the valley wall must resound as loudly . There was no mistaking that helm , richly ornamented , mailed , masked , though little he had dreamed of the true power worked into it . Of moving swiftly , and unseen ... And the walk he knew no less well , the sharp , measured stride that set the robes fluttering like dark pennants in the still air . Just opposite them , two hundred paces at most , the figure stooped , the helm 's malign eyes turned this way and that , uneasily . Towering above , the hooded shape swayed patiently , waiting . Then the mail of the mask was swung back , the helm lifted in gloved hands , dark hair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked once more on the pale proud features of his former master . Again the Mastersmith glanced from side to side , as if he felt burning eyes upon him , but then he looked up , straight into the smoke-dark shadow of that swaying hood . He gazed a moment , and then , very solemnly , he bowed . A flash overhead , sudden and startling , tore Elof 's gaze away . The starstones were raining thicker and faster now , darting through the paths of the stars like mocking children , streaking the night sky with orange and red until they rivaled the Lights . But then these also blazed out , with a power that charged the air till it cracked like a forest fire and the travelers felt the hair lift and bristle on their heads . Behind the Lights the stars seemed to leap and dance in the distorted air , bent into a mighty corona with its heart among the Lights . They rippled once , twice , three times , even more violently , and then it was as if they folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling to earth . A great cone of bright radiance hung in the air above the heart of the Ice , pulsating like a heart , and the man and man-shape alike turned to face it . Within that mantle a form took shape , stately , cloud-tall , pale as pearl , thin as smoke , its own light shining through it . A woman 's shape , unclad , arms outstretched and long hair streaming out behind her as in some unfelt wind . Slowly , solemnly , the gray hood inclined . But the man bowed deep , deeper , till he sank down upon his knees , and forward still till , arms outthrust , his forehead rested in abject adoration upon the glittering Ice . " Now ! " hissed Kermorvan , for the eyes were turned away . " Now ,  |p186for  your life ! " He swept out his sword , then gasped in horror as green phosphorescence leaped and wavered on its point and trickled crackling down the blade . A mighty gust of panic surged through Elof . He seized the glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kermorvan slammed it back in its scabbard , and they turned to run . Down the drift they slithered , crouching like apes to stay in the scant cover , bounding along on their staves , stumbling and falling into deeper patches of snow , never caring for the crevasses that gaped hungry on every flank . Neither dared look back , but ran and ran till every breath came like fire in a raw throat and their limbs were knotted with pain . Once they went slipping and sliding away down into one of the crevasses , but the snow they carried before them broke their fall ; they scrambled up and went stumbling on in the shelter of its high walls . Climbing out at the end was less easy . They had to hack steps in an overhanging wall , but when they managed it , and lay gasping on the brink , the radiance at the heart of the Ice lay far behind them , no more now than a cool , distant glare through which no detail could be seen . At length the two travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word they turned and went trudging off toward the dark lines of the moraines . Every now and again Kermorvanwould turn and look back to be sure nothing was on their trail , but only once , as they crested a heaped moraine , did he clutch Elofis arm , and point . They threw themselves down in the snow . A long shadow wavered across the glacier , but the figure that cast it against the nacreous light was small , striding away southward once again . It seemed to Elof that his head was bare , though it was too far to be sure . When they looked back once again , he had not vanished ; shrunken by distance , a tiny figure still labored on across the rubble of the glacier . " Your late master , I presume ? " inquired Kermorvan sardonically , though there was a catch in his voice . " I wonder why he does not use the helm once more ? " Elof shrugged , and walked onward . The way was less far than it seemed , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than on the south , and lower . They crossed them easily in an hour or two , and werep187glad of their shelter ; a wind was rising now , and when they looked up at the sky the stars were still , and vanishing behind the clouds ' swift onrush . Beneath them the ' Ice glittered empty and lifeless once more . At long last the day dawned , though bleak and gray , with no sun visible . Kermorvan shook his head like a man awaking from a dream . Ahead of them now the peaks rose , and even their stern barrenness seemed more wholesome than the Ice . Only two hours after dawn they stepped off it as they might off a ship . When his foot left its surface the cold fire drained at once from Elof 's legs , so immediately he all but staggered and fell with the relief ; only a chill , normal and endurable , remained . Kermorvan again seemed to sense nothingunusual . Instead he was gazing up at the clouds and sniffing the air . " Snow indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield us any longer , and we have no way but to climb ! Elof , my smith , pray that we may find your mysterious light soon , or it may be the death of us ! Come ! " The wind moaned around them as they climbed the valley wall . It was steeper here than on the south side , and they had to keep their arms free to climb , so their cloaks could not protect them against the biting wind . The rock , though hard , was cracked in many places by the bitter cold of the Ice , and more than once what seemed a sturdy ledge would go sliding out from under their probing feet and rattle away in a shower of little stones to crash down at the rim of the glacier . " And reveal where we are , if any follow , " grunted Kermorvan . " But at least the slope seems to be growing gentler . Here comes the snow ! " The first few flakes were indeed swirling around them , and more came streaming down along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirling in their faces as they toiled on up and came at last to a long slope leading up the peak they sought . Soon the snow was lying in their path , great fat flakes that melted only at the edges , that fused together into hard ice underfoot , coating the stone like glass . Elof had to take care not to tread in Kermorvan 's steps . By the time they came on an easier part of the slope , it was already deep in snow . Their boots picked it up as a hard shell and grew heavy , so they must needs break it away with the staves . " If thisp188gets any thicker we may miss our way , " said Kermorvan anxiously , " and in the mountains that is deadly ! But we are not so far below where you saw that light , now . The clearest way up would be to follow this rockwall here  --  " He touched it , and pulled away his hand with a cry of surprise . " It 's warm ! At least , warmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top there , those cracks like great vents  --  and smoke is rising ! Earthfires ! " He slammed his staff down furiously . " So that is what the glow must have been ! Nothing would live underground where the fires are strong ! We have doomed ourselves , and for nothing ! " " Do not be so sure ! " said Elof sharply , though he , too , felt a cold qualm of doubt . " The Mastersmith 's house was built over just such a place , and harnessed the fires for the forge ! Might not the duergar do the same ? " Kermorvan started to shake his head , shrugged and picked up his staff . A curtain of gusting snow swept down the slope , piling what had already fallen into deeper drifts . " It makes no odds ! " he shouted over the sudden roar of wind . " We may as well die looking  --  " A huge shadow reared up in the snow . A vast arm outthrust clutched at his throat . It was as sudden as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Elof had time to duck , and the thing went blundering past him , toward the cliff . Rock splintered and fell away , and there was a bellowing yell of pain and rage . Elof bent down , grabbed Kermorvan and dragged him away from the wall and a little way up the slope . He lay gasping ; Elof stood over him , drew his sword and hefted his pick in his left hand . But after only a moment Kermorvan was struggling and cursing back to his feet . " What was that ? " he demanded , fumbling with his scabbard . " A snow-troll , I think , " said Elof tautly , " though I 've never seen one . Gray fur , black claws and the size  --  " He licked dry lips , and felt the cracks in them sting . " I think it was what followed us in the forest ; they go there sometimes  --  " The snow swirled , there was another bellow and a sudden rush from behind them . Elof turned , slipped and fell flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then whipped back , with a jarring shriek of rage . Something hot and stinking sprayed across Elofs jerkin , and when he scrambledp189up he saw a great spatter of red in the snow , and Kermorvan standing with smoking blade . " Back to back ! " he yelled , " and we 'll hold them ! Morvan morlanhal ! " A chorus of shrieks answered him , and dreadful shapes loomed up in the whiteness , closing in around them . Arms swept out , and Elof hewed at them ; dark blood fountained , and a huge hand fell writhing into the snow . Behind him it sounded as if an axe smote solid wood , a metallic snapping clang , and Kermorvan staggered back into him as a huge body fell flat in the snow . Off balance , Elof saw a terrible face arise , a snarling , snow-encrusted mask like a fearful parody of a man 's , and above it a jagged boulder clasped in black claws . He dropped down past a leg like a gray tree trunk , and even as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous calf . The thing convulsed and toppled , shrieking horribly , and he struggled up and passed his sword through its body . Then he sprang forward into blindness , to where Kermorvan had stood , but was no longer . A gray heap lay sprawled there with a sword-shard glinting in its skull . Troll-shapes loomed around the rock face , three at least , and the warrior was backed up against it , one shoulder streaked with blood , striking out with the splintered stump of his blade . Elof snatched up his pick and hurled it at the broad backs , shrieking mad words of challenge against the wind . One squealed , they turned to face him , and he scythed his sword at them two-handed , the black blade thrumming as it clove the stormblast . He took a step , and astonishingly they fell back ; again , and another one loomed up , and was barged aside as once more they gave way . Then as Kermorvan came skidding down the slope Elof sprang forward and hewed in earnest , and they turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back , and a trail of shrill yelps faded into the snow . " Well fought , smith ! " yelled Kermorvan . " But they 'll be back , when they 're over their fright ! Alas , one took my sword in his thick skull ! " He was fumbling furiously in his pack with his wounded arm . " A dagger  --  " " Forget it ! Drop that , and come on ! If they 're coming back we 've got to climb ! Climb , d' you understand me ? Those vents  --  maybe we can find one that 's safe ! They 'll be warm , at least ! " Kermorvan nodded , but clutched the pack protectively to him.  |p190Elof  gave up and went hurrying up the rock face ; Kermorvan stayed on his heels with no apparent difficulty . Rime crusted white on their brows and around their scarvcd faces , where it melted in their breath and sent little damp trickles down their cheeks . The wind yelled , and the snow lashed and stung their eyes till they could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden a new wall was looming up in their path , and in it dim shadows appearing and fading as gusts blew across them , the only dark things in a world lost to whiteness . Eagerly they staggered forward into the wide mouth of the vent feeling the stone warm indeed under their hands until Elof collided with a rock face . " It 's blocked ! " he called . " Try for another ! " " Too late ! " cried Kermorvan . " They are out there now ! " A vammeringcry answered him , as if in mockery . Elof ran his hands desperately over the smooth stone , was he dreaming , or could hestill feel air moving around him , air warm as a spring breeze ? Kermorvan was bracing himself , clutching his absurd stump of a sword . " Try and get to the next one , " he said calmly . " Or away altogether , if you can , while they 're busy on me . For busy they 'll be ... " " No , madman ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something strange here  --  " His hand slipped across an outcrop of the rock , and his fingers closed under it . It was thin , too thin  --  and the shape of it ... He ducked down and peered through it . Warm air , staleand strange-scented , played over his face , melting the rime of hisbrows and hair , so he hardly knew whether it was water or tearsthat came trickling down . " It 's metal ! The wall is a casting ! " " What ?  --  " See for yourself ! Gridwork , in the rock , sculpted to look like it ! Angled so cunningly you can scarce see through ! " " Can you open it ? They are coming , those out there ! " " Here , take my sword ! And give me yours  --  " Elof ran knowing fingers over the metal , rapped it and listened to it ring . It was beautiful , cunning work , but the weakness of such a casting wasthat it must look like the rock it was set in ; that strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and again , listening , and finally rang the sword pommel against it . " Quickly ,  |p191if  ever ! " hissed Kermorvan . Elof hesitated , dry-mouthed . A low , gloating cry came from the cave mouth . He jabbed the blade stump deep into a slot and with all his great strength bore down on it in one single effort . He felt the ruined sword bend , creak beneath him . Then there was a sudden sharp clang , a glint of bright metal , and one small bar of the grid snapped and bent outward . It was not enough . In utter desperation he set his fingers in the gap and heaved , felt it give slightly , braced his feet against the wall and pushed till the sinews cracked in his broad back . Kermorvan spun round startled at the grinding squeal of metal against stone . " Kerys ! A gate ! " But the moment his gaze turned there was a rush and rumble at the cavemouth , and a great form blocked out the snowlight . Kermorvan whirled and plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bubbling yell cut off suddenly , and Kermorvan fell back , freeing the sword with a vicious twist as a huge body slithered noisily down the wall . Without breaking stride he tossed Elof the reeking blade , snatched up his bundle , and before the smith could stop him he plunged like a diver through the narrow slot of darkness , beyond which might lie anything . There was a crash , a slithering sound , the rattle of loose rocks dropping down into emptiness . Elof groaned , and dived after him , only to be caught by an iron arm behind the door . " Easy , my smith ! There 's a drop of some kind just beyond ! Now let the mice stop their hole again , before the cats recover . " Together they dug fingers into the slots and pulled , feet sliding among the rubble , until the gate , screeching and protesting , ground home against the rock . Elof wedged the runners with such chips of rock as lay around . From outside came sounds of movement , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutched his sword tight . Were the things man-wise ? Would they find the broken bar ? They were strong enough to slide back the gate ... He felt a great weight press against it , then a sudden ringing impact that almost overset him . But this work was made to withstand crude assaults , and agonized brute yelping trailed away , lost in the wind . He heard Kermorvan chuckle in the blackness . " Somebody has earned a sore toe , I 'll wager . Kicking the wall like a brat over a lostp192treat . " The swordsman shifted painfully . " We have had a sore journey , you and I. Now my fine sword that came from my old home must lie and rot on the mountain . My broadsword was already broken , so now I have none , and that is a worse laming to me than this shoulder . But at least we seem to have come to the right place ! " " Cunning work ! " sighed Elof gratefully . " And a keen mind that saw through it ! Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look ? " said Elof doubtfully , but he turned . After the noise and whirling whiteness outside , darkness and quiet seemed to press in on him like a stifling weight . But his eyes were growing accustomed . There was a faint glimmer , a pool of dim radiance spread out before him . He reached out , but Kermorvan held his arm . " Do you hear ? " Now , as soon as he turned his mind to it he did indeed hear , and feel , for the low , slow throbbing came up through the rock under them . He thought of the wheels turning in the Mastersmith 's forge , and the hammers that shook the house . He realized then , remembering the rattling stones , that the light-pool was in truth an opening , a shaft into unknown depths . " A steep drop , " said Kermorvan , scrambling forward . " But see there , those regular shadows ! Those must be handholds , some carved in the rock , others iron rungs . We can climb down , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call down first , to herald ourselves and let themknow we come peacefully .  --  " Would they heed such a shout ? Or even understand it ? It is said they do not care for human guests , peaceful or otherwise . We would be too vulnerable on those runs the might fill us with arrowsand never find out their mistake . Soon enough to explain ourselves when we are on firm ground again . " " I take your meaning . " admitted Elof . " Can you climb with your shoulder as it is ? " " Easily , it is a scratch . Though I will be happier the sooner it is washed and tended ; who knows what filth was on those claws ? But let us be on our way . " The shaft was steep , but far enough from the vertical to make the going quite easy . This was fortunate , for they were both morep193exhausted than they had realized . Their limbs trembled , and Kermorvan'sshoulder tired quickly . " But at least the handholds are firm and well placed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest . I had been afraid they might be too small and weak if the little people made them  --  " " They may not be as little as you seem to think , " Elof warned him . " I could ill judge the height of the ones I saw , but they seemed  --  well , solid . We would do best to use them with respect . " " Naturally , for they are perilous to rouse , it is said . " " I meant more than that ... " Elof began , but gave up . Kermorvantalked of these duergar as things other than human , but Elof could not forget that ring of faces , strange in their features but vibrant and alive and wholly human in their feelings . Hopefully he would see for himself soon enough , for they were almost at the base of the shaft now . It seemed to be widening around then , opening out into a broad and shadowy chamber with what looked like an earthen floor . " A few steps , " gasped Kermorvan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content . I , I am going to rest  --  " A shrill whistle sounded . There was a flicker of movement , a sound like a great wing beating in the air between them , and Kermorvanvanished . Metal clashed and jangled as if a forge roof had fallen in , and he sprawled on the chamber floor entangled in a glinting net ; dark figures rushed in on him . Something lashed painfullyround Elof 's legs and tore them away from the rungs ; the rung he held bent under the strain , then his fingers were pulled free and he dropped hard onto the floor and lay winded . A heavy net fell over him , he tore at it and found linked metal rods resisting his efforts . Harsh shouts echoed in the shaft , strong hands seized him and coiled ropes round the net , and he was hoisted up and borne forward . Lights danced and flickered around him , earth thumped under heavy feet and they gave way to the hollower drumming of wooden planking , behind it the rush of running water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what felt like a wooden cart . He could hear Kermorvan cursing weakly somewhere in front of him . Wild anger woke in Elof , and drowned all his caution . He had come all this way , through wide lands , hard weathers and the terrorsp194of the Ice , all to be netted like some wild beast , without a word spoken or question asked . Well , let them listen now ! Ile dug his fingers into the net , bunched it into two huge handfuls and tore it free against the ropes ; they snapped and fell away , and he sprang to his feet , shouting , " Wait  --  " But then he stopped , and his mouth fell open . He stood , not in a cart , but in the center of a long boat moored at a high wooden wharf , lined with glowing globes of light on posts richly carved ; beyond it , a street of housefronts whose warm-lit windows glinted on the cobbled road . And all around him , the sound of a wide , rushing riverA torrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to his knees , saw the planks rise up to meet him and rolled over into darkness.  |p195The  sounds grew louder , the bellowsroaring , hammers pounding , the heat and the light so fierce he could hardly approach the forge . Yet struggle nearer he must , braving the pain and the shriveling heat , to grasp the scorching metal , and hammer , hammer out the thing that must be madeHe struggled up on one elbow , grasping and shaking his head as if he could somehow displace the ringing ache . The light hurt his eyes so much , he did not at first notice it was dim . The first thing he saw was a goblet on the floor beside him , and the sight of it awoke a terrible taste in his mouth . He caught it up and sipped tentatively , then gulped down the strong wine in a draft , coughing as the bitter residue of herbs caught his throat . Blood roared a moment in his temples , his stomach lurched and then suddenly the room swung into clarity . Sitting across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old chests and baskets , was Kermorvan , looking somewhat battered and pale , but with his shoulder neatly bandaged . He met Elof 's look with a wry cold smile , and lifted one foot slightly . There was a ring and clink of chain . Elof looked down at his own feet ; they , too , were fettered through on the grimy floor . Memory spilled back , and he was about to burst out in angry questions when he saw Kermorvan roll his eyes meaningfully sideways . He cast ap196casual glance that way , and found that they were not alone . They were indeed in the hands of the duergar , and evidently in their dungeons also . A sing le one of them was guarding the travelers . Elof grew less surprised at this the more he weighed up the sturdy figure sitting comfortably in the corner by a door as low and wide as himself . He wore no mail , only jerkin and baggy trousers , but a solid helm covered all his head and most of his face , save a squat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the t-shaped slit in the'i visor eyes glinted ; they seemed to meet the smith 's gaze and return it with the same even scrutiny . That , and the tending of their ills , was an encouraging enough sign in its way . Across the guard 's knees , however , lay a formidable billheaded spear , one gnarled fist almost negligently around its axis , where a single twist could swing it to stabbing height . Elof turned back to Kermorvan . " Have you told them anythingof our quest ? " Only that we came in peace , and in opposition to the Ice . ButI might as well have been talking to one of your anvils , for all the answer I had . I thought it better to say no more then till you were awake again . I think we are to be sent before someone . We were many long hours in that barge , and though I could make out little , trussed and dazed as I was I believe they brought us to a place far from where we first  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked at them for a moment , then thrust open the door and ducked out . " A fine dungeon ! " laughed Kermorvan . " No lock on the door . Though it is dirty enough , in all conscience , and these fetters adequate . Had I my sword  --  " " It would avail you little , " said Elof , tracing the bluish sheen of the metal bands around his ankles . " This is strong work , and newlooking , the fastenings also . As if this place had been made into a dungeon from the storeroom it looks to be  --  " Kermorvan arched his brows . " Why ? Because they 've never before needed one ? Surely not ! " The door creaked back , the guard reappeared as suddenly as he had gone . He marched over , swatted Elof 's hand aside and undidp197the band . Elof sprang up on unsteady legs , but more helmeted figures appeared now in the doorway . They gestured him forward , but kept spears leveled at his chest . Behind him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducked awkwardly through the door and cautiously into the corridor beyond . The sight of it made him shudder . Grim and bare as it was , he could not think why , till he realized it was made in the same fashion exactly as the corridors of the Mastersmith 's tower . Understanding that , other things began to slip together in his memory . But he was given no more time to think , for spear-butts at their backs urged them on ; Kermorvan glared angrily , though he had the wit to stay calm . They were hurried along and round a corner , then up a flight of steep steps and through low heavy doors . Smooth paving replaced flagstones under their feet . The room beyond was as gloomy as the cell and passage , and little wider , but its ceiling was high enough to be invisible in the shadows , even the tops of the high dark doors in the far wall could not be seen . Guards took station beside these and the doors they had come through , grounded their spears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low buzz of voices from the room beyondKermorvan nodded . " So , " he whispered , " we are indeed being brought before somebody of importance . Let us at least hope hewill give us a hearing ! " asked Elof . " Can you understand " How can you be so surewhat they say ? " " Kermorvan chuckled sourly No indeed . But courts , it seems , do not change overmuch , whether it is men that hold them or not . This antechamber , the sentinels , the hubbub , all unmistakable . " Then three great strokes boomed on the high doors , and the guards sprang to haul them open . Smoky red light flooded in , the travelers were thrust forward into it , and the doors slammed solidlyshut behind them . Blinded at first by the stratiga gTare they saw nothing , but heard the babble , smelled the strong scent of an excited crowd around them . It was a hostile babble , and the smell was not that of ordinary human bodies . To Elof it was strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , more like the cleanp198sweet smell of the cattle he had tended . But Kermorvan held his head high and wrinkled his nose fastidiously . As their eyes cleared they gazed upon what they had endured so much to find , the court of the duergar . A high hall it was they found themselves in , the highest indeed that ever Elof had seen . Yet he might have thought himself under the roots of some impossibly vast tree , for so the columns of the walls were carved , gnarled straggling shapes that closed together in shadowy vaultings far overhead . The air under this strange roof seemed at once fresh and smoky , like a late autumn afternoon ; the reddish glow came from torchlike objects set high on the walls and burning steadier than any torch . The light danced about the gilded carvings covering the doors , glowed on the sharp-edged patterns set in the polished stone of walls and floor , where flakes of pink granite and green dolerite , purple quartz and ruddy sandstone vied with strange and rare minerals . Shapes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall above the heads of the dimlyseenthrong . An image was there , so striking that Elof forgot all else in contemplating it , a high silhouette seen from below , like a man through the eyes of ants , a broad figure haloed in glittering flame and with a hammer raised in one firm hand . Before him was an anvil , and he hammered at something held upon it , somethingshining and jagged . It might have been a short , burly man , that figure , or one of the stranger shapes that now closed in around him . " Well , men ? " a cold harsh voice demanded , speaking the northerntongue . " Feast your eyes as you will . You came to find thewealth of the duergar , through many perils , no doubt . We would not grudge you one brief glimpse of it . " They were not , as Elof had warned , so very small . The tallest , rising on their toes to see , were less than a head shorter than he , though many were much smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wider than most men , with heavy arms on broad sloping shoulders and thick neck . The faces , though , seemed strangerthan he remembered , for now not one of them was smiling . The mass of them , the adults , looked carved from old , well-seasonedwood , and carved deeply at that , for almost all were a mass of lines ; those framed with white hair might have been made of bunches ofp199cords . But it was the beardless faces , the younger faces , that were the most disturbing . There the unhuman mold showed stark beneath the skin , bared of the trappings common to man and duergh . The forehead was low and sloping , partly hidden by the bushy brows that rode the arched ridges above the eyes ; but it was those eyes , huge , wide and deep-set , that banished any trace of the bestial in the face . The noses were almost all large and slightly snubbed , but varied as much as those of men . Below them , though , the duergar face fell away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those to a heavy clean-edged jawline with no trace of a projecting chin . High cheekbones and thick jaw muscles hollowed the cheeks ; the ears were large , lobeless , curled at the top into a slight suggestion of a point . If they seemed to be set rather far back , that was because the head itself was longer and wider than a man 's . All of these things Elof noticed , and yet in the same instant he saw men who were handsome and girls who were pretty  --  or might have been , had they smiled . But it was not smiles that bared the large teeth , or kindly curiosity that had them milling forward around the travelers . An angry buzz filled the hall as the voice spoke , and guards sprang forward to clear a path with their spearshafts . Elof saw then that the hall was a shallow amphitheater centering on a narrow platform , below the vast image . The dais stood head-high to the duergar , with many solid figures seated about its base , their very attitudes at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not change . But more impressive by far , though he lacked their dark-sheened robes and rich furs , was the speaker . He sat atop the dais , in a chair of plain gray stone . Its arched back , upon which thin lines of gold traced out a single straight character , was high enough to diminish the tallest of men . He who sat beneath was not the tallest of duergar , withered and bent with age unguessable , but it diminished him not a bit . The stone around could not have been harder than his voice . " Your coming , you see , was known at once . The rivers bring us messages , and the air , the cave breezes  --  but most of all the stone . " His fingers caressed the rough gray chair arm , almost tenderly . " Always the stone . Our northern outposts are few now , but they are ever alert ; they must be , for they watch the Ice ! And so youp200were taken . You  --  men . " The word hung bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish on which first we took pity on your kind ! Upon which we , the Elders , first sought to raise you up from your animal estate , as we ourselves had been raised long since ! Every time we have aided you , misery and pain have repaid us . Across half a world we have fled you , and yet still you leave us no peace . II By luck or design you have fallen among us , where no man should , and awoken greater fear and disquiet than I looked to see in my lifetime . I would know why . " Angrily he tugged the plain robe of silver fur closer round his thin limbs . " I am Andvar , lord of all the duergar folk in these mountains . I am half tempted to kill you at once and have done . But I will not have it said that I stoop to the level of your folk . Speak , then . " Kermorvan 's face colored with anger , but he kept his peace and looked to Elof , who stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you will not regret hearing us . We are sorry to have alarmed you ; the way we came , we were driven to by sore necessity and fell pursuers off the Ice . But we came to these mountains in search of the duergar . We came to gain your aid , not your riches . " There was a rumble of sardonic laughter , and even Andvar 's dark lips twisted . " Aid also may be stolen , as we have learned . What is your quest ? " Elof met his gaze . " A quest vital to all who oppose the advance of the Ice , and the Ekwesh its champions . And though I have never spoken with any of your folk , I have once at least proven myself no enemy , and been treated in turn as a friend . " A stir of interest ran through the great hall , and Elof held up a hand . " I ask only that you hear my whole tale , before making your judgment . " Andvar waved a wide leathery hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , and settled back on his bleak throne . " So be it . All here will understand your tongue well enough , and fairly you speak it . But I usually know the names of my friends . " " Of course , lord , " said Elof uncomfortably . " This is Kermorvan , a great warrior from the Southlands , my companion . " Kermorvan bowed , though with a strange smile on his lips , as if there was something sadly lacking in the description . " My name is Elof  --  " Derisive laughter hooted through the hall . " A modest name ,  |p201indeed  ! " barked Andvar . " That ancient title , The Smith , know that we give it only to one who is truly One Alone . " He gestured up to the mighty image above . " If you are offended , I am sorry ! " breathed Elof in utter dismay . " I chose it in all innocence , for I was a nameless foundling , and I am a smith among men . For I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped , sensing the sudden chill hush in the hall . Andvar 's eyes narrowed , and his fingers tapped on the arm of the throne . " That name is no longer any bridge to our favor . " " So much the better for me ! " said Elof defiantly . " Will you keep your word , and hear ? " Andvar sat rigid with anger against the stone . " Say on , then . Be silent , all . " From that moment the listening duergar might have been carved from the rock , until Elof told of the forging of the test pieces . Then the whole atmosphere in the vast stone chamber changed , and the stillness grew charged , as before thunder . When Elof finished telling of the forging of the sword , it was Andvar who broke his own command . " You forged that thing , boy ? You ? " A long finger crooked at him . " Come here , smith among men . Let me look at you more closely ! " Elof stepped forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , leaning on tall staves , and drew closer , their wide eyes staring through and through him . He stepped up on unsteady legs , and the wrinkled face of the duergar lord bent over him . Ancient eyes , yellowed but clear , met his ; he held the gaze , and was startled to see a reddish flicker deep in the huge pupils that was no reflection of the torches . After many minutes Andvar sat back in his throne . " It could be ! " he said , and his tone was thoughtful . " It could be . The crafts of man and duergh are very different things . Those are strange fires burning in you , but hot enough , indeed  --  " Then the wrath in him overran his curiosity , and he slumped back , knotting his hands . " And what claims on our mercy does such a feat give you , then ? How shall we best reward the making of so evil a thing ? At least I shall not now think your end unjust , for there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of your own whom you betrayed . An apt pupil you were , of that master ! He was our friend at first , and of service to us , and when he sought to settle in our ancient watchtower we agreed , won over by pity for one exiled from among men ! Pity ! We even helped him build his forge , and shared our wisdom freely ! And then when we found him delving in our mines , and dealing with uncanny folk , we warned him , sought to have him leave freely . He delayed us for long months with endless pleas and promises , and at last even threats . Even in the end , when we had to send a force to dispossess him , we gave fair warning  --  and do you know how it was met ? " " I do , " said Elof " I was there , because I was fleeing him , and the thing I had done . I sought to warn your folk , shouting from the hillside above . I am sorry I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic as I thought  --  but I see now that it must have been the sword , its effects tempered by distance . Some of your folk , I believe the survivors of your force , found me and my then companion , and took us to freedom by underground ways . They judged that I was their friend , and I am grateful to them . Will you gainsay them now ? " Andvar stared at him in astonishment , but before he could speak , one of the lords sprang up onto the dais , caught Elof by the shoulder and whirled him round . A hard-planed face , neither old nor young , stared into his a moment from an almost equal height . A band of gold , finely worked , gleamed round his thick neck . Then Elof was clapped on the shoulder with staggering strength . " What he says is true , this man-smith ! " barked the duergh . " He has changed , but I would not forget him . He saved most of that party , me and my girl Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underhills . He earned that much help , and more , say I. " " That 's right ! " shouted a female voice from the crowd , amid a growing rumble of dissent . Andvar raised a hand to quell the hubbub . " You were ever generousto men , Ansker . I will not say you did wrong , in that instance . But what this man-smith has unleashed  --  and why has it taken him well-nigh two years to seek our aid ? If there is more to tell , man , you had better do so ! "  |p203A  bitter despair rose in Elofs throat , though Kermorvan was gesturing to him to go on . Whatever he told them , would this malign old creature ever agree to help a human ? Not by the will of his folk , it seemed , unless perhaps this Ansker . He stole a glance at him . It was met by an encouraging nod , and the dark-haired duergar girl Ansker was talking to waggled her eyebrows slightly , and grinned , so that he remembered her also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words spilled out into silence , like a stone into a deep pit , till he told of the strange rider at his door . Ansker sat up then with a sharp hiss of disbelief , but the lords around him drew back , and the crowd muttered unrebuked . When Elof had finished , the duergaroverlord looked at him long and silent , and when he spoke his voice was deeply troubled . " What then would you ask of us ? " Elof held up his hands . " A key ! A key to unlock the power that lies here ! I unleashed this evil , as you rightly say . You can not yourselves counter it , or you would have ! Who else , then ? Surely I have the power , if anyone  --  but I lack the knowledge ! I have made master 's work , but I am an apprentice still , and masterless . Be you my masters now ! " The silence broke like a floodwall , and the duergar voices rose in a great roar to the high roof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A spate of argument broke out , furious jabbering both in the northern tongue and a sonorous , rolling speech , and many surged down around the throne , milling and jostling . Kermorvan they almost ignored ; it was Elof the row was about , and it looked to be savage . One or two of them came charging up the steps of the dais , and had to be thrust back . Andvar 's looks grew blacker by the moment , until he sat suddenly straight and gestured to Ansker and the other lords . Their staffs hammered down on the dais in an echoing drumroll that washed away the contentious voices from the hall . Andvar smiled grimly into the sudden quiet . " So ! Humans may be a rare sight , but that is no warrant for imitating them ! We will hear my counselors on this , Ansker first who has walked most among men . " Ansker bowed to Andvar , and turned to face the hall . The gold collar shone like a token of the authority in the lean face above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should help him . We have to ! " The hall droned like a nest of angry wasps , many muttering but not daring to raise their voices against their lord 's fierce glare . " Think of it ! " shouted the great duergh fiercely . " You 've all heard what the creature Mylio is up to with the sword now  --  raising those savages up to assault the human lands  --  " Andvar shrugged . " How should that concern us , my good Ansker ? Are we likely to see the Ekwesh galleys sailing along our mountain streams , laying waste to our deep wharves ? Let man kill man , andwe may sleep at our ease in the mountains once again . " " May you indeed ? " shouted Kermorvan suddenly , and the anger in his clear voice was startling . " Lord of the duergar , does your wisdom sleep ? I have heard such words in the mouths of fat burghers in my own land , when I told them of the threat to the north . Nay , I have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never come far enough south to menace them . And these last weeks I have seen their bones and their children 's bleach under the sky ! So I ask you this  --  when both northern and southern realms of men have fallen before this Mastersmith , what then should shield you ? He knows you are here , he knows your ways , he covets your wealth and surely he hates your challenge to his will ! And most of all , he is not driven only by his own greed , which might know a boundary , but by the powers of the Ice ; what restraint have they ever known ? So be your wharves aboveground or below , will he not be bound to seek them out sooner or later ? Take heed it is not sooner than you think ! " He paused , and from his great height cast a cold glance around the duergar court . " And consider this also . This man-smith , as you term him , Raven himself came to his aid . You can see as I could that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the powers themselves offer freely ? " The hard words echoed out into a silence as absolute as any Andvar had commanded . Anger still simmered through it , but shot through now with doubt and apprehension . Heads turned to their lord as he sat slumped in his great chair . " My wisdom does not sleep , " said Andvar at last , icily . " I do not fear any of them , Ekwesh , Mastersmith , even the Raven-Wanderer . You do not know the power of our mountain fastnesses , man . "  | " I do , " said Kermorvan calmly . " I am here . " " With help ! " barked the old lord over the rising disquiet . " And you were known and caught at once ! As for Raven , even allowing the tale true , we may honor him , but we do not march in his steps ! " He gestured up to the image that towered over his throne , and Elof could see now that it was rich beyond price , the flames alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe allegiance to one power only , and that is Ilmarinen the Smith , who alone of all the ancient powers keeps true to his trust ! He shaped us our refuges of old from the coming of men , and he will not desert us now ! " Then Elof saw the jagged work of silver upon the anvil , and understood . " He shaped you the mountains , then , to preserve your folk , and their wisdom ? I for one am glad , for I have learned to value great craft , and I revere those who use it well . But lord of the duergar , have you ever thought why your folk were preserved ? Was it simply that you should all grow inward and apart , here below , and contribute nothing to the world outside ? I know little of the powers , but I can not believe they would waste riches thus . Was it not rather for such a day as this , when the dark arts of the Ice we both hate may be countered by your ancient good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear voice , and the girl bounced up onto the dais beside him . " That 's the word ! " To his surprise , other voices echoed her , and were not shouted down . There was a shufflingin the hall , a sound of taut unease . Andvar , staring open-mouthed , recovered himself and glared . " Do we then need humans and children to teach us our purposes ? " " It seems we do , " said Ansker quietly . " The powers do not tolerate stagnation forever , we know that . Lord , we have been complacent too long already . I hold myself as responsible as the rest . We must begin to act , and where better than here ? " The buzz of voices swelled , and Elof felt a shiver of excitement at the change in it . Andvar was turning this way and that to his other counselors in a debate that grew more heated by the minute . " So ! " he said at last , and the silence fell again . " As I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside assault , whether by its minions or the Ice itself . But this man-smith shapes doubt as skillfully as evil weapons , and sets my folk against my will . Well ,  |p206have  your way , then . Ansker , you hold yourself responsible , you say ? Then I will , also . Hear my decree ! You may take this creature and teach him what you will , for two years at most . That is time enough for us to judge him , and see whether we may safely let him go , knowing as much of us as he does . But we must meanwhile be sure of him . For that length of time he will never , upon pain of death , set foot beyond your dwelling and forge . Well , are you satisfied ? " Behind him Elof heard Kermorvan utter some exclamation under his breath . He was dismayed himself . Two years , without open air , light of moon and star . . . And in that time what would be happening in the world outside ? But what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low to Andvar , and to Ansker . " If Ansker will have me , I am honored . " Ansker smiled . " Have you some work of yours about you , lad ? " " I . . . fear not , my lord . Except the hilt of my sword , which was taken from me at my capture . " Andvar gestured , and a guard came forward bearing his blade and Kermorvan 's two broken ones . Ansker unhesitatingly picked out the dark blade . " The others are sothran work , " he said absently , and sniffed . He peered at the hilt , rubbed his finger up and down it , and tilted it to the light . " What virtue did you set in this ? " he demanded . " I do not know , lord . I made it when I was . . . unwell . . . and did not try to give it any . " Ansker 's mouth twitched , and he turned to the girl . " Look upon this , Ils ! " Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they burst out laughing . " Oh , it has a virtue all right ! " chuckled Ansker . " But you did not make the blade ? " " No . I found it , in the marshes of the Debatable Lands . " " Ah , " breathed Ansker , nodding . " It is a strange thing . But the hilt is fine work for a human , sir apprentice . " " Then it is settled , " said Andvar grimly . " And I suppose we must extend our forbearance to this sothran his companion . " " Your magnanimity honors me , lord , " said Kermorvan coolly , and bowed . " But warm as was your reception , I have no wish to stay . So by your leave  --  "  | " I give you none , " said Andvar thinly . " Your pardon , lord ! " said Kermorvan more heatedly , " but what is the good of imprisoning me here ? I am no smith , there is little I can do in your land , and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came only to guard and guide my friend over a difficult road  --  " " Nevertheless , you came ! And as for guarding and guiding , you would not get far if you tried to return without your friend to shield you " But he was shielding me ! " said Elof confusedly . " Do you really think so ? " smiled Andvar contemptuously . " Do you imagine light is so easily seen from our airshafts , or the gates on them so lightly protected ? There is a virtue in them , that they can not be told from the stone in which they are set , save by our people . And yet you , Elof , saw the light from afar , your friend only because you had shown him it . You found the gate at once , and saw how it might be broken . What else , I wonder , have you all unknowingly found throughout your travels , what menaces has the power in you held at bay ? " Elof gaped , shaken to his core . " But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave us , if at all , when he does . Though I agree we have little use for you . A human warrior ! " He sniffed . " I would not trust such a one bearing arms for me . Still , we shall find some useful employment for you . The mines , perhaps  --  " " Do you mock me , Lord Andvar ? " Kermorvan 's face had turned pure white , save dashes of red that burned in his cheeks , and his eyes as empty as the sea . Towering over the duergar , he strode forward . Guards clashed their spears together in front of him , and they were thrust aside like stalks of grass ; the blades leveled at his back , but he paid them no heed . " Keep me here , if that is your will . Have me rot in your dungeons , if that suits your whim ! But do not try to make me your slave or your beast of burden ! I was not born to such usage , though I will endure any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would sooner walk from here to the River than lift the lightest burden of a slave ! " The crowd growled , and Elof suddenly felt very alone among them , for he did not understand the wrath that had come over hisp208friend . " Do n't be an idiot ! " hissed Elof . " You worked on the ram with me  --  " " That was necessary , a soldier 's task ! " said Kermorvan frostily . " Well , this  --  " But Kermorvan was deaf to all else , and his voice rang clear as the hammered silver on the wall . " Hear me , Andvar , and consider well ! For I am no common man . My forefathers through many generations have sat in judgment as you do now , upon a chair of stone , robed with the authority of the law and the will of their folk . They have condemned men as the law dictated , to prison or to death  --  but never to be a beast of burden ! If they had , so it was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their rightful authority would have fallen from them like a tattered cloak . And so it may from you , lord and king . For will you have it said that you stoop not only to our level , but far , far below it ? " No duergh stirred or spoke . Kermorvan stood tall among them , like a tree against a stormy sky , his face set hard as their palest marble . Elof stared , for he had never seen the man so . Time hung round him like a heavy mantle . Andvar seemed old , his halls ancient , and yet Kermorvan who was young bore as great an air of antiquity , as if he were only a link in a great chain that stretched unbroken away into the deeps of time . The lordly , even condescending , manners had hardened into something immensely strong and ageless , like statues he had read about of ancient kings , and the wrath that had blazed in the gray eyes had frozen into a bleak , terrible justice . And before those eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he spoke his voice sounded quivering , almost querulous , after the ringing music of Kermorvan 's . " I meant neither disgrace nor mockery , " he muttered . " Labor in the mines is esteemed a work of solid worth to us all , those who undertake it hardy and strong . " " And courageous ! " added the girl Ils , firmly . Elof eyed her ; he detected something in her voice , something left unsaid , and he could guess what . Mines would suit the bravest , true  --  but only those who could offer no better skill of mind or hand . Among these worshipers of skill they would be little esteemed . Kermorvan , though ,  |p209a|p|peared  not to see that , because abruptly he stepped back and bowed stiffly to Ils , and again , less deeply , to Andvar . " I thank you , lady , " he said . " And I accept your given word , Lord Andvar . Since that is so , though the task is very strange to me , I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension in the hall was almost tangible , but Elof was torn for a moment between common sense and his duty to his friend . He did not wish to see Kermorvan made a fool of , but if he told , then all was awry again . Worse , though , might follow , if that fearsome warrior worked it out for himself . In desperationhe looked at Kermorvan  --  and saw a rueful twinkle in those chilly eyes , that both startled him and lightened his spirits . Kermorvanknew very well what had not been said  --  and was pretending he did not . Elof sprang down from the dais , and wrung his friend 's hand . " Do n't think I do n't know what you 're doing for me ! " Kermorvan shrugged in slight embarrassment , surprised at himself . " Not only for you . For the first time I find it better bending to a wind than falling altogether ; too much is at stake . I am sure my ancestors would understand . Let it pass , you have what you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They had better be . Let us hope the Mastersmith does not strike against your land before then . " " Yes . It depends whether he chooses to overrun the north completelyfirst . But if I were he , I would not , for the real threat to him lies in my land now . " " And ours ! " said Its cheerfully . Kermorvan bowed again , but Elof looked her up and down with frank curiosity . The strange duergar face looked well on her ; in fact , she was more than comely in anyone 's eyes . Her black hair , cut short and very curly , came almost to her brows ; her wide , intelligent eyes were very clear and brown , her nose pert and snubbed over an enormous , infectious grin . She wore boots , a short heavy kilt and a dark tunic , sleeveless and caught in at the waist with a richly ornamented belt of leather and mail , on which hung a long sheathed knife and various less recognizable things . The tunic , baring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buxom to human eyes , but also revealed the play of hard muscles in her arms and shoulders . She returned Elofs look withp210equal frankness , and suddenly reached out , tweaked his upper arm and jabbed him in the ribs . " Not as weak as most humans , just underfed ! Well , we 'll look after you  --  " " Be sure that you do ! " said Andvar harshly . " For mark you , I hold you both answerable . The warrior you will take down to the wharf and there commit to the custody of Bayls of the mines . But this one is your responsibility ! And on you , man-smith , I lay one further charge . We may let you return to your kind , one day . Say what you will of us then , good or ill , we care not ! But we alone may share our wisdom . Swear by your very craft that you will never reveal its secrets ! Now take them from my sight ! And blindfold , that they learn not the ways ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then they went forth from the hall . Guards led them hooded through long corridors , and through heavy-sounding doors-into a wide space where the air was fresher and cooler , and sound less confined . Over cobbles they walked , and the sound of running water grew ever louder , until their feet drummed on some surface of planking that creaked against stone . There the guards handed over Elof to the care of Ansker and Ils , and Kermorvan to Bayls , who was harsh and curt of voice , and ordered him aboard ship at once . The warrior laughed . " So it begins . Bear up , my smith , and learn well ! Do n't flatten your thumbs on the anvil ! Make it all worth our whiles ! " " I will ! " said Elof fervently , wishing he could find better than that to promise . " And you , have a care of that high head of yours on the roofs ! " Its helped them shake hands , and Kermorvan was led aboard . Elof stood listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordage as the boat was made ready , feeling once more alone and adrift , blaming himself for his friend 's plight . Suddenlyhe felt the hood being tugged up over his head . " No guards around to tattle , so away with that foolishness ! " said Its firmly . " Well , " said Ansker indulgently , " since we must pen you up , it would be a shame indeed not to have at least one sight of the duergar realm . Behold , then ! " Elof , blinking , looked from him to Ils , and then , slowly and unbelievingly , around him . It had felt so exactly like the open airp211on a cool summer 's evening that he had not stopped to think just where they might be . He stood on a wide river wharf full of bustle and movement , a well-made work of wood upon a stone slope ; white sails were being unfurled , flapping in the brisk breeze that was rising along the stream . But that stream flowed in through a dark cavern mouth in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it vanished again into another wall . Elof 's eyes followed that wall , up , up , expecting to see a strip of the sky over high valley walls . But sky there was none , and he had to fight not to shrink down under the weight that oppressed his mind , beside which all the works of man looked small . For above the wharf rose steep streets of houses , small but solid , their windows glowing in the dusk light , and above them in turn , cresting the hills , the walls and turrets of a strong citadel , lowering in the stone . Its many circles of walls , so smooth they might have been hewn entire from the stone , dwarfed both the houses and the strong towers and galleries that ringed the surroundingwalls . But great as it was , that citadel was dwarfed in its turn . For the little town and all around stood within the bounds of a vast cavern in the living stone , a wide hollow hill as it seemed , and overhead was stone unbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , dimmer than the lanterns by the river . He thought of where that river must lead , of other wharves in other caverns under the high hills . And the realm and power of the duergar loomed very great before him , like some vast beast which has lain sleeping and all but forgotten for long ages under the earth , but might yet arise to awe the very daylight . " You see , " said Ansker , without appearing to notice how the sight affected him , " the heat of the earth at these depths warms the air ; this wars constantly with the cold air of the mountains , and so is in constant motion throughout the long caverns of our realm . Thus the air is kept flowing and fresh , and gives us breezes on which our ships may sail . " Elof shook his head in awe . " I wonder if we were not foolish , Kermorvan and I , with our bold words to your lord . How could Ekwesh or Ice ever threaten you in such a fastness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foolish ? Never say so ! First bit of sense anyone 's talked in council this century . Did me good top212hear . Andvar 's getting on , that 's all , and he does n't like men much . Remembers when they were pushing into our farmlands and huntinggrounds . " " For we grow most of our food aboveground as you do , " said Ansker , " on high mountain terraces . And so we are just as vulnerable to the Ice in that way . And in other ways . The Ice can wear away even a mountain , little by little . Have you never heard stone splitting in the cold nights , and the grind of the glacier against the rock ? But it need not even do that , there is a faster way to overwhelm us . If it can fix the cold around us , keep our winters harsh and drain some of the warmth of summer by sending cold winds and fogs and freezing water in the rivers , then every mountain 's cap of snow will start to grow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very soon it will become a glacier in its own right  --  and one with no more mountains between it and your westward lands . And beyond them , only the sea . Thus the Ice may breed , in mockery of the life it so despises . " " And the duergar ? " asked Elof hoarsely . " Master Ansker , what would happen to your folk then ? " " Burial , " said the elder duergh solemnly . " Utter entombment  --  our airways choked , our rivers frozen . The blood and breath of our realm cut off , and our high pastures and fields no doubt laid waste by the cold or the fell things the Ice unleashes . But that will be slow to happen , for the Ice moves most easily where heart and spirit will not stand against it , where knowledge and craft can not flourish , and only strife , oppression and bloodshed prosper . " Elof nodded slowly . " I remember things the Mastersmith said , when first he showed me the Iceglow in the sky  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking to freeze away animal passions and leave pure thought . Perhaps normal humans  --  and duergar  --  are offensive to it ; perhaps it truly can not abide the presence of a great mass of beings who both think and feel . So it can only come against us when we are already weakened and scattered . " Ansker nodded . " And so turns man against man , and perhaps man against duergar . It were well that our old strife were forgotten , and our still more ancient kinship was renewed . May this be the first step on that stair ! For though we must confine you , yet you are our honored guest . Come now ! "  |p213The  wharf stretched all along the riverbank , its sides lined with immense stone blocks like those in the Mastersmith 's tower . At intervals along it were tall columns bearing torchlights , their reflectionsgleaming red-gold in the still dark water , and below these were ladders and stairs leading down to the waterside . All these were made of dark metal most curiously and beautifully wrought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation , and the dual nature of our kind . Andvar now , he was a worker of stone , and shares its virtues , to be hard , dependable , enduring . But Its and I and many of us , we are metal ; we are strong in our way , perhaps , but flexible also , able to change and be shaped by time and events . " Its chuckled . " And yet to keep enough spring to find something of our former shape when needed . You , I think you also are metal , and your friend in his way . " " I pray that he is ! " said Elof , looking down at the boat , which was ready to depart . It was a strange craft , long and narrow and smooth-sided , with a low mast and wide square sail , very lightly rigged . He waved , though he did not expect to be seen . But to his surprise a tall figure turned on the deck and waved in return . Ansker chuckled . " Bayls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ; he would not leave anyone blindfolded longer than need be . I do not think you need fear too much for your friend . " Elof sighed . " That comforts me ! " The gentle cavewind bellied out the sails , and the craft glided out onto the glassy black river , leaving scarcely a ripple , like a dream . The crew were singing in their deep voices , a merry-sounding song in the duergar tongue , which Elof can not then have known . Yet a version of a song in the northern speech is here preserved in the chronicles , and it may well be the one . Deep under stone the breeze is rising , Hoist the sails , for we 'd soon be gone . Bid goodbye to your bright-eyed judies , We 'll sail where gold outshines the sun ! Deep in the caves the river 's running , To your oars , for there 's rapids soon ,  |p214They  'll have a jump your girl wo n't give you , We 'll sail where silver outshines the moon ! Deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a watch afar ! Rock grow fangs in the narrow channels , We 'll sail where a jewel outshines a star ! Little is recorded of the things Elof learned in his months of study under the smith Ansker , for such wisdom was not commonly committed to records that all might read , and least of all by Elof ; he kept his oath , as he kept all , faithfully . It is known , though , that much of what he learned concerned the natural properties of things , and how they were related , rather than of arcane craft . " For that is in most ways a shadow , " Ansker is recorded as saying , " of the power that lies in you yourself  --  a subtle and intricate way of shaping and channeling what flows from you to your work . This you have seen . When your guilt hung heavy about you , you could set all the signs you wished upon simple work , but no virtue took root in it , for you feared in your heart of hearts to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within you . But upon this sword hilt you set no sign at all , and yet it is rich with craft . " " What is the virtue in it , then , that you and Its saw ? " asked Elof . " And why did you laugh so ? " Ansker chuckled again . " Because , my lad , you could have brought nothing better calculated to make us trust you . Ils ! Look again , and tell him . " She caught the sword lightly , handling the sharp blade with care , and turned it to the light . " I see no definite virtue ; truly you left it formless , a song without words . " She gave him a mischievous smile . " I see you ! Or . . . or an aspect of you . You as you became in the Marshlands . Your purposes . . . the things you wish to fight . And to defend . " She looked at him , past the hilt . " By not directing your power , you 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That may happen sometimes , with things we make and use for long . They take on an air , an aura of their owner , as a dog may of its master . But never so strongly ! " She shook her head in surprise.  | " You 've mirrored your living will in this sword , so strongly it could almost speak . Even now it may make a fair sound as you wield it , a kind of singing  --  am I right ? " Elof blinked . " I have wielded it only amid great noise , in a seafight and a storm  --  but yes , at the last it hummed , a deep note ... " Ansker frowned . " The sword ? Surely you mean the hilt only , for the blade 's no work of his ... " " See then ! " she said , and laid it down . Ansker 's fingers glided over the metal , following the elusive gleam in its blackness . " You are right ! " he said at last . " It resides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ever could that be ? Perhaps there is some old spell in it which meshes with your power  --  but so strongly ! " He sighed , and looked at his apprentice keenly . " Elof , you must take care . You have deep wells of craft in you , and you seem always to pour more into your work than you expect . Doubtless the Mastersmith hoped only for a weapon that would sway his enemies , or at best cow them  --  not drive them shrieking in droves ! Be warned . " " But if that 's so . . . " Elof stopped . He was thinking of the bracelet , and the virtues that lay on it . If he had made that as powerful .. . if she only knew , might it not serve to break the hold Louhi had on her ? He became aware that Its was looking at him a little strangely , and remembered she had seen things he wished to fight  --  and to defend . How clear had her vision been ? He shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control something I do n't even understand ? " " Learn to control the materials you work with . Learn their properties , what they can and can not do , and apply your craft accordingly . When it is this powerful you may use it as a cutting edge rather than a bludgeon , and so aim it more accurately . Less craft , more skill ! " So Elof turned back to his anvil , and many a long month he slaved there , struggling with metals he had once thought easy to work , and many other substances also . He learned the subtle arts of alloying that could make something chiefly of gold or silver almost as durable as steel ; he learned how to make things of steel as light almost as wood by crafting cunning edges , honeycombs or websp216whose strength lay in their shape alone . He learned how to work strange light metals that would not normally take shape under the hammer , or would burn like a starstone at the first touch of the flames . Ansker taught him much lore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never made much use of . But strangest of all , it is recorded that he learned from the duergar smith how to look deep into the structure of the metal itself , to see the shock of each hammerblow travel through it as clearly as ripples through a pond , and how the next blow or heating or quenching would affect what he worked . He even , it is said , came to know the many shapes and forms and structures that the very crystals of which all metal is made might take , and none in more detail than iron . That was a metal he had almost come to scorn , because it was so easy to work ; but of all the mistakes he had made , he came to believe that this was the greatest . For with the initial ease went infinite variety , especially in the alloying and shaping , and much of thisrequired almost an infinity of skill and patience . But it was at this difficult work that he was to become most accomplished of all . To learn so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resent his confinement to Ansker 's forge and halls . These were in a cavern chain of their own , high in the mountain that was the duergar capital . " It is an ancient place , " the smith said , " and so hallowed  --  the forge has served my line since the duergar first settled in these mountains , many an age past . There are virtues of many kinds to be gained simply from working in such a spot , andit is always best to have your own settled forge , when you can . " Elof stared into the rich flames . " And I do not even know who my parents were . I am a wanderer in this world , nowhere at home for long . Would that I might find such a place ! But my heart misgives me , when I think of it . " " May you never have cause to rue it , then , " said Its softly . But where Elof stayed in one place , Kermorvan did not . Ils , who traveled widely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it grew ever better . Set to labor in the mines , he impressed the duergar first with his unrelenting endurance , which matched their own , and later with his great valor and prowess . Dark things stalked the mines , for there were old workings which ran out under thep217Ice , and guarding them was no easy task . Once his party had to face a great snow-troll , of the kind that had hunted him and Elof into the mountains . Armed only with a pick , Kermorvan held the passage against it till guards could come , and struck its deathblow in the fight , a feat that won him great honor . For that , against the will of Andvar , he was himself made a guard , and at last was being sent the length and breadth of the duergar realm , helping to guard the miners and the precious trains of ore . It is said , though , that he always pined in this world of twilight for the sun and open air , and seized every chance he could get of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depths of winter . But though far enough south at times to be within reach of his own land , he never broke his trust and stayed to serve the duergar faithfully . For that , perhaps , they honored him most of all . He was never permitted , though , to speak with Elof . Its took word to him , however , and no less encouraging . Elof 's burgeoning craft amazed the duergar , who had never suspectedhumans were capable of such skill . Many called upon Ansker to see and sneer , and went away marveling . So both men prospered in their way , and won the regard of some , at least , of a secretive and suspicious folk . But one thing tormented them both , and that was the lack of word from the world outside . Most duergar cared little for the affairs of men and avoided any contact . The only word came from outlivers of both peoples who might occasionally meet by chance in the wild lands around the mountains , and since they were equally solitary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once some young and adventurous spirits able to pass for men had walked briefly among them ; Ansker had been the most daring of these now living . But Andvar had long forbidden any such practice . The best Elof and Kermorvan could glean was that the Ekwesh , though powerful in the north , had not yet made any decisive strike southward , and with that they had to be content . But there came a day when Kermorvan was taken from his post , and told he was summoned to the capital . And as he took ship northward , he reckoned up the days , of which lately he had lost track , and realized with a thrill that their allotted time was almost up . A great excitement and a cold fear swelled up within him then ,  |p218all  too closely mingled . He was glad when he came to the door of Ansker 's forge , a vast cluttered cavern hall strewn with anvils , benches and weird devices , and saw his friend 's bulky shadow on the rough rock wall , hammering away at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutely judged . Only when he had finished did Elof lay down his hammer and look up . " Kermorvan ! " They shouted with laughter , and wrung each other 's hands . " Welcome , wanderer ! You great fool , what kept you hovering there ? You should have called out ! " Kermorvan smiled wryly . " I know better now than to interrupt a smith at his work . These duergar folk are an education ; the mildest of them might cleave your skull for that . I feared you might have picked up their habits  --  and in truth , you have something of their look about you now ! Leaner , more lines on your face , and the only color in it the forge-tan , heat and smoke . " And his eyes , " smiled Ils , " How they take the fire now , eh ? " Kermorvan , smiling , turned to bow , then froze , blanched slightly and whirled away to eye some pieces of armor lying on the side bench . Its shrugged , and turned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only reasonable that in this heat she should work as he and Ansker did , stripped to the waist . But to spare his friend he changed the subject . " Well , I wo n't say you 've not changed since we last met . Did n't think you could look much harder , but you do ! And how 'd you come by that color under hill , eh ? " Kermorvan laughed . " They thought I could use some open air , so they sent me south to their mountain pastures this spring . I 've been guarding the herds and the fields on the mountain terraces . Me , guarding goats and deer and herdsmen ! . But it was welcome work , for all that . You could have used it , by the pale face on you ! " Elof nodded , and his broad shoulders sagged a little . He slackened the band of cloth round his forehead . " It seems a lifetime since last I saw the sky . And I have missed so much the seawind among trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where only the bats are happy . " Then he straightened again , and the flames danced in his eyes . " But it was worth it ! For I have been hard at work  --  and not without result ! " Kermorvan 's face grew tense . " You 've learned something ? "  | " Learned much , many things . And not only learned them , but put them to good use . Which reminds me  --  " He turned suddenly and went to the anvil where he had been working . There he bent over something , wiped it with a cloth , and stood up with a dark-bladed sword in his hand . He tossed it hiltfirstto Kermorvan , who caught it neatly , hefted it approvingly , and gazed in wonder at the blade . The metal was not bright , but gray with an odd golden sheen , and as he looked closer Kermorvan could see it was marked with a pattern of minutely fine dark lines that flowed shimmering like water through the metal . " What magecraft is this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silk , water-shot silk ? " Then his fingers danced on it , as if it was hot to the touch . " Is this another one of these patterned spellboundmonstrosities ? " Elof smiled tolerantly , and shook his head . " Neither silk nor spellbound , and you may handle it safely . None more safely , in fact , for I made it for you . " " Oh , " said Kermorvan . " Ah ... Elof repressed a smile . Here was the man looking embarrassed again , at his unintentional rudeness ! " Well , I owed you one , I thought , since you 'd broken both yours , and one in helping me . I had no time to make two , so this is a hand-and-a-half blade . I was only finishing fitting the pommel as you came in just now . But you need not feel uncomfortable with it ; there is no magic in it , as I knew you would prefer . " Its chuckled . " Nothing you would know as magic , in any event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the mindsword , but from tiny amounts of flame-pure charcoal in the steel , lending it great strength . " " Charcoal ? " said Kermorvan , startled . " Would that not weakenmetal ? Or is that not some magic ? It seems a fine and fair blade  --  " " Yes indeed ! " said Ansker 's voice from behind them . The smith strolled down the steps and held out a hand . " Welcome , Kermorvan ; I am glad the message found you so promptly . You 'll honor us by accepting a stoup of ale ? I thought you might . Ils , stir your stumps , girl , before we die of thirst ! So , a fine sword it is , and hard in thep220making ; but there 's no spell in that . The charcoal 's cooked into the metal as it 's drawn living from the ore , and lodges in the very crystals of it . That makes it hard , but brittle  --  almost like stone . The real art lies in breaking down just enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel , so you can balance the qualities . A powerful lot of forging that takes , strong heating , hard hammering , slow cooling and quick quenching  --  a great labor . See how the lines run the length of the blade , but here and here and all the way up they fold in across it ; that 's where the hammer last struck , tempering the stony metal against the springy . Our dual nature again , stone and steel . But few if any among duergar smiths living could craft you a finer blade than that one . " " High praise indeed for sword and swordsmith ! " breathed Kermorvan , and looked at it with new wonder . " And a great gift , Elof , for any warrior among men . My thanks , good friend , and may it repay them in the hand ! " He swished it through the air in one hand , then in two . " Or hands , for as you said , it is a perfect handand-a-halflength for me . I 'll wager this one wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True enough ! " agreed Its as she reappeared . To Kermorvan 's evident relief she had donned a patterned brown tunic , and bore two large stone tankards in each hand . " But for proof , " she added as she passed them around , " you could try it on your own pate ! Not having a troll handy . " She sat down on the large anvil , and sipped delicately at her own ale . " No proof is needed , " said Kermorvan stiffly , and Elof smiled to himself again . Its seemed to unnerve this stiff-necked sothran more than a mountain full of trolls . " It bears witness to your teaching , and Elofs skill . " " Aye , it 's passable , " said Ils , with a curious expression . " But there 's better witness than that ! Has n't he shown you yet ? " Kermorvan looked sharply at Elof . " You 've made another weapon ? Something you can use against the Mastersmith ? " Elof nodded . " Maybe . Worth trying , anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaking the excitement in her eyes . " He made your sword in the times he had to wait for this ! While he was waiting for the crystals to grow  --  "  |p221Elof  motioned her to silence . " Better we show you , " lie muttered . " You are the warrior , after all . Tell me what you think of this as a weapon . " He strode over to a cluttered workbench , and picked lip one of the various pieces of armor Kermorvan had been looking at . A great lefthand gauntlet of mail and jointed plate it was , long enough to cover an arm to the shoulder ; no joint , no seam in it , but was covered and blocked by finest mesh mail . Every finger was a masterpiece of minute armory , molded in bright smooth steel , and covered in the strange lined characters of the duergar and the swirling archaic script of the north , the joints sealed by welded ringmail as fine as cloth . Heavy as the gauntlet looked , Elof donned it with ease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered at the hand as he did , and saw set in the palm what looked like a great white jewel , cut flat , upon which the fingers closed . Elof glanced around the forge , bit his lip , and walked over to the fire . With his free hand he pumped the small hand-bellows till they gasped like a hunted animal and the coals at its heart glowed redwhiteunder leaping blue flames . Its caught her breath , and Kermorvanstared unbelieving as he saw his friend reach out , shielding his face , and plunge his mailed arm downward . " No ! " The swordsman was on his feet in an instant , but he was too late , too far to stop those steel-sheathed fingers dipping deep into the dragon-glare . A sickened look on his face , he watched the hand rise clenched from the flames , like the fist of Surtur stirring under the earth . Fire dripped from it , and the steel of the fingers bore a baleful glow . Then , very slightly at first , they unclenched . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , as if somehow still fed there by the bellows blast . A glow spread between the fingers , flames arose and licked around them , and yet the metal itself showed no sign of heat . Slowly , very slowly , the fingers steepled , and a thin cone of flame roared and trembled at their apex . With a grin on his face , tense , taut , triumphant , Elof swung round and thrust out his mailed arm in a defiant gesture . The fingers spread wide . A tongue of fire darted across the forge , licked a scorched circle on the wall , and vanished into nothing . Kermorvan sat dazedly staring at the circle , for though among the duergar he had heard much of smithcraft , he had never before seen its power so clearly.  | " A remarkable thing , " said Ansker calmly . " It is made in somethingthe same fashion as our lanterns . But in all our long years of craft and learning we duergar have never achieved anything quitelike it . " " You see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has virtues onit of catching , containing , binding . It could do as much with the sunlight , or the wind , running water , the sound of a voice  --  any force , anything that has heat or motion it can grasp , gather andturn back . " " Including the force that turns men 's minds ? " demanded Kermorvansharply . " I ... think so , I hope so . Ansker and Its could teach me little about it , even when I showed them that strange goad , and theisymbols I took from it ; the duergar have never sought to learn the skills of domination , not even to withstand them . But I have , to my sorrow . I know something must pass out of that mindsword , to strike so many at once . As I have felt , its power is diminished by distance , exactly like a lamp 's light or a voice , or the flight of an arrow . So is it not also some kind of force ? " " A dark light a voice speaking fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So I felt it . So it laid its hand on me even as I fled . " " And I , " said Ils , and the light faded in her wide eyes a moment . She shivered in the forge 's heat . " I do not wish to face that ever again . It was terrible . " Kermorvan looked doubtfully at Elof " You think , you hope , itmay work . But you will not know , will you , till you go up against your enemy ? Can you risk such a thang I expected  --  I can not say  --  another sword , perhaps . To meet fire with fire ? " Such means are not mine to use ! " said Elof bitterly . " I can not play with fear and terror , to thrust the minds of men one way while the Mastersmith drives them another . For what then would happen to those minds , caught between two such powers ? Would they not crack and shatter like nutshells between stones ? Or would you have me drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set them on to slaughtering each other ? " He stared bleakly into the distance . " How long must such a struggle endure , when the only real combatantshide behind their forces like human walls ? For years , forp223generations of slaughter and death ? Madness and ruin , both , and our only reward the cold pleasure of the Ice . Or worse . If I set myself to driving men like shoals before the shark , year after year  --  then even suppose I defeated my late master , would I not in the driving grow too much like him , and step into his place ? " His voice dimmed with anguish . " It has come close to happening before . He chose me , and he was not wholly wrong . We are too much akin , he and I. " " Folly ! " said Kermorvan sharply , twisting his new sword nervously in his long fingers . " That gauntlet can not possibly match the power of the sword ! At best it is a defense . You should have made some weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I can not turn the craft in me to such ends , not now . It would rebel against me , as once already it has . This  --  " He hefted the gauntlet . " You misread my purpose . This can not strike of itself . It can only gather or return what is sent against it , and with only such force as is used . It can collect that force , bind it , even concentrate it . But it can add nothing of its own . " Kermorvan clutched the sword to him , and bleak despair settled in his eyes . " It 's not enough ! " he insisted . " Kerys , it could n't be ! A toy , a trick  --  " Elof laughed softly , and held it out , palm open . Kermorvan 's scornful words came echoing back at him , and he flinched . Elof looked at him sardonically . " Are you so sure ? Maybe you deserve a better proof . Stand , and be answered ! " Kermorvan rose awkwardly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . But Ansker drew her aside . " Now , " said Elof , unmoving . " Take that fine new sword of yours . Lift it high , yes , like that . Then when I give the word , you may strike me down . " " What ? " cried Kermorvan , faltering . " Do as I say ! " snapped Elof . " Bring the blade down on my head , and with all your strength , mind ! Then we shall see how the trick is played ! " " Elof ! " gulped Kermorvan dazedly . " I am sorry ! I did not mean to  --  "
