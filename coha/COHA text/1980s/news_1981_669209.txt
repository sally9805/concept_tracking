But the competition is getting stiffer as Korea ' s cheap wage advantage disappear . Structural changes in the market are putting greater emphasis on high technology rather than the labor-intensive projects in which the Koreans have long excelled. // Since they first began tendering for Middle East construction projects in 1974 , the Koreans have built a good , reliable reputation for building roads , port and airport facilities , housing blocks , and government buidings. // Now they want to try to break into high- technology projects such as petrochemical plants , steel mills , and telecommunications . But it is precisely in these fields where , at present , they have little or no advantage against technologically advanced American , European , and Japanese competitors. // Could this , then , spell the end of the construction boom ? // Not at all , says Young C. Park , research director at the Korea International Economic Institute , who has made a detailed study of Korea ' s overseas construction activities and their impact on the domestic economy. // " Undoubtedly the emphasis in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we have excelled , into high technology areas . But we are already taking steps to cope with this switch in strategy and I really don ' t think we are going to lose our strong position. " // In 1975 Korean construction firms successfully tendered for building contracts worth $800 million . In 1978 the total reached $8 billion , and despite ( or because of ) domestic economic difficulties , this held firm at $8. 3 billion last year. // The Koreans , in fact , have carved themselves out a handy 8 to 10 percent share of the regional construction market , second only to the United States ( an estimated 17 percent ) . The Korean share , surprisingly , surpasses even the mighty Japanese , who last year saw their share of contracts halved from 15 to 7. 3 percent. // There are now 97 construction companies strictly licensed by the government to compete for overseas contracts . The Koreans are active in 34 countries , but the bulk of the work is in the Middle East , and primarily in Saudi Arabia. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure buildup and are leading the way in switching to more ambitious industrial projects to make better use of their vast oil wealth. // Even before this , though , the Koreans were beginning to consider their heavy dependence on one country not necessarily in their best interests  --  even if it was a prime supplier of crude oil. // According to Young C. Park : " Over 75 percent of construction work undertaken by Korean firms was in Saudi Arabia in 1979 . That was reduced to 64 percent last year , and Kuwait and Libya have now emerged as important areas for diversification. " // A second stage will be to diversify further , into Africa , Southeast Asia , and Latin America , especially when domestic construction firms in the Middle East become capable of replacing the foreigners. // But that move will require the sort of financing that the Koreans admit they simply are not capable of at present . So , for now , it ' s better to concentrate on the oil producers where money is no problem. // In trying to carve out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Koreans readily admit they can ' t go it alone. // " Our present technology is simply not competitive enough , " concedes Mr. Park . " So what we are proposing is joing ventures , say with American , British , or French companies , in plant construction. // " In the civil engineering phase , we have a definite advantage on costs that developed countries simply can not match . So we would primarily undertake construction of the plant itself , while the other partner would provide the machinery to go inside. " // Korean firms have already received such a proposal from West Germany for a petrochemical project in Saudi Arabia , he disclosed , adding : " I see no reason wmy American firms shouldn ' t follow suit. " // Such joint ventures already exist with Middle East companies , and last year these accounted for almost half the Korean total contract amount. // Choo Sang Kook , senior vice-president of Hanyang Corporation , a leader in both domestic and overseas construction , recalls that " in 1975 when we tried to compete in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong there then and asked to be involved . They refused . It was like the prewar situation between Japan and the West. // " Finding to such opportunities , we decided to compete with them flat out . But in order to break into the market we had to sacrifice most of profits . I thing if we could have got the cooperation we sought from the Europeans we could both have made larger profits from the start. // " Now we have proved ourselves . Last year I was part of a construction industry mission to Europe which again proposed the idea of cooperation . This time they were ready to listen. // " It makes sense . We spread the business and political risks while playing complementary roles. " // Big wage increases averaging around 30 percent in recent years have somewhat eroded the Korean price advantage on labor intensive projects. // But , asks one industrialist proudly : " There may be other countries who can provide labor cheaper than we can ; yet , who call match our strong position in respect of good management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom end of the labor market , Korean firms in the Middle East have begun hiring a few Indian , Pakistani , and Indonesian workers at lower wages for unskilled work. // There are more than 100 , 000 Korean workers in the Middle East at present , and that number is unlikely to shrink drastically in the foreseeable future. // The only factor that might change this would be a sudden acute shortage of skilled construction workers at home , forcing up wages and narrowing the advantage the overseas workers now enjoy . This conceivably could happen as the government is planning to boost the economy through expanded public works projects and a great many more housing starts than normal this year. // Construction workers are sent on a one- year contract , office staff on two . The former are required to return home after their contract expires , but there is nothing to stop them changing planes at Seoul Airport and flying right back to the Middle East . In fact , many workers in the region are now on their second or third tours. // The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the tax exemption level is set at around $500 a month , against the ordinary rate of $250 . The average skilled wage in Korea is $300 a month. // The tax concession is a government acknowledgement of the important role the overseas construction boom has played in keeping the country ' s balance-of-payments deficit within manageable bounds. // Out of last year ' s contracts worth $8. 3 bilion , the net foreign exchange gain was $2. 2 billion  --  to be set against a balance-of-payments deficit of $5. 4 billion ( which could have been far worse in view of the nation ' s domestic economic woes and soaring oil import bill ) . // //
