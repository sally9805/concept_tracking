By Babette Krolik I am tired of reading about single women and the joys of home ownership . With the regularity and conviction with which women ' s magazines used to run stories on how to transform oatmeal boxes into gift accessories , the media is now telling me that I am not a real ' 80s woman unless I am indentured to a mortgage whose balance is probably equal to my grandfather ' s lifetime earnings . It used to be that home ownership was extolled for its stability . The property owner was a tax-paying member of the community , unlikely to riot in the streets or trash fire stations . This was the philosophy behind the Great Society ' s home ownership programs of the late 1960s . Today ' s articles never mention the civic virtues of home ownership . It is the financial advantages that are touted in every paragraph . Indeed , the message is that it is down right stupid and financially irresponsible for anyone over the poverty level not to lock up a little tax-shelter-cum- inflation-hedge in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , I am particularly pressured by these arguments . Daily , evidence passes over my desk that home ownership will be an impossible dream in 10 years ; that prices rise by the millisecond ; that the fixed rate long term mortgage is as passe ' as live-in help . A high level government official , I have been told , seriously questioned the professional acumen of any job applicant , grade 13 and above , who did not own a home . Sometimes I feel , as a renter , that I am the last person in America who pays full taxes . Denied the homeowner ' s interest and tax deductions , I pay the complete marginal rate , which means my effective tax rate is higher than that of the millionaire investors for whom I humbly toil every day , constructing real estate tax shelters . Before , I didn ' t mind paying taxes . I even took vague pride in the idea that my money was helping the poor . I am less enthusiastic about contributing to MX systems now , but , basically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be done with it . But I don ' t want to live in an environment , like Italy , where the focus of all economic activity is evading taxes and anyone who pays full taxes is a fool . To be honest , a Peter Pan fixation also contributes to my resistance to home ownership . My generation never wanted to grow up and be soiled by adult materialism . We would forever be free , and young , and all our possessions would fit in a rucksack . Today , of course , even poverty lawyers speculate in Washington real estate . But there have been costs to this growth in net worth . Particularly in times of high interest rates and enormous monthly payments , a mortgage seems to be the strongest surviving social fetter . I have friends locked into jobs and cities they dislike because they can not sell their homes . Families can be left behind , spouses can be shed , grand pianos can be moved , but the one unbreakable social and geographic contract seems to be the monthly payments to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the old days , growing up was a forfeiture of freedom for the assumption of family responsibilities . You bought a house and tied yourself to a job and a community because there were children to raise . And kids , presumably , needed stability . Few of the smiling women waving their mortgages today have children . My friends redoing 14 room Victorian mansions are single women or , at most , couples . ( Fewer single men seem to have this nesting instinct . ) Are these houses , like the spinster ' s cat , some kind of substitute ? It is wonderful to visit homeowners . They have guest bedrooms and gardens and all manner of civilized pleasures . But I do not want to be one . I am not free booting . The money that doesn ' t go into mortgage payments can go into the savings the economists are clamoring for . I just don ' t want to feel like a chump . The society that forces people into home ownership for purely financial reasons , when the traditional social and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something too .
