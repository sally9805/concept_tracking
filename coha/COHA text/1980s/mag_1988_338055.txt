The plane was formed of space-age plastics , but its mission was inspired by ancient legend . The goal : to see whether man could fly under his own power across 74 miles of Aegean waters , much as a mythological Greek named Daedalus once escaped his island prison on Crete by fashioning wax and feathers into wings and soaring to freedom . Last week , in a historic attempt to re-create that flight , a team led by engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology succeeded in bringing the myth back to life . For an arduous 3 hr. 54 min. , Kanellos Kanellopoulos , 31 , Greek Olympic cyclist and 14-time national champion , pedaled a 70-lb. plane dubbed Daedalus 88 from Crete to a crash landing just off the island of Santorini . Said the wet but beaming pilot : " Everything went like clockwork . I did n't feel at all tired . " <P> The project was conceived in the late 1970s by John Langford , then a student at M.I.T. and now a researcher at the Institute for Defense Analyses in Alexandria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brawn of 36 engineers , students , historians , physiologists and athletes  --  and nearly three years  --  to realize . Like the ultralight craft Gossamer Albatross , which crossed the English Channel in 1979 , Daedalus uses human energy and a pair of pedals to drive its propellers . The craft was designed and constructed specifically to challenge Albatross 's records for both duration ( 2 hr. 40 min. ) and straight- line distance ( 22.3 miles ) . To achieve this , the M.I.T. team built a gearbox with a 2-to-3 ratio instead of using a standard bicycle chain to transmit pedal power to the 11-ft. propeller . In addition , Aeronautical Engineer Mark Drela designed an extra-thin wing that provides 30% more aerodynamic lift than stumpier conventional wings . The team chose a strong , lightweight graphite compound to mold the plane 's hollow , dime-thick spine . <P> In extensive preflight tests , Ethan Nadel , a physiologist at Yale Medical School , verified that the demands placed on the pilot  --  the equivalent of running two marathons back to back  --  would not exceed the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the plane flies just 15 ft. above the ocean waves , even a second 's pause would result in a quick dunking . To keep the human engine from sputtering , Nadel , with the Shaklee vitamin company , developed a lemon-flavored cocktail of energy-rich glucose , water and a blend of salts to nourish the pilot throughout the flight . In addition , Daedalus ' team of five pilot-athletes staggered their training schedules , each of them bicycling an average of 450 miles a week so that one of them would be in peak physical form whenever the go-ahead for the flight came . <P> For a while it seemed that moment would never come . Blustery winds forced the attempt 's cancellation for three weeks . The local people sympathized with the Amerikanakia but told them they were attempting the impossible . Even the team 's most optimistic members began to wonder what would happen if they did take off . After all , had n't they brought three planes with them , just in case ?            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
