But he was convicted of four other felonies - including grand larceny and forgery - and a misdemeanor charge. // The verdict in the case - the first trial to involve charges brought as part of the municipal corruption scandal - was delivered by the jury at 4 : 30 P.M. on its eighth day of deliberation . <> <> Faces 20 Years in Prison // In all , Mr. McLaughlin , a lawyer , faces 20 years in prison and automatic disbarment , although a prison sentence for more than the maximum on one count , 7 years , would be unlikely . Mr. McLaughlin said he would appeal the convictions. // The Manhattan District Attorney , Robert M. Morgenthau , described the decision as " a major victory. " // Mr. McLaughlin called it " a big vindication " and said he believed he would prevail on appeal. // The District Attorney said : " The defendant was a senior city official at the time and is an attorney . He is convicted of stealing from his client while in public office and lying to the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant conviction. " // Mr. McLaughlin , his eyes fixed on a spot above the jurors ' heads , remained impassive as the verdicts on the 15 counts were read by the foreman , Ann Jacobson , a parochial school teacher , in a cavernous 15th-floor courtroom of the Criminal Courts Building , at 100 Centre Street . The 40-year-old former city official looked calm. // His lawyer , Thomas P. Puccio , said , " The so-called city scandal hysteria is something people should keep in mind as we go through these various trials. // " Frankly , if there wasn ' t a climate such as there is in the city right now , this charge would never have been brought. " // Mr. Puccio will also be representing Stanley M. Friedman , the Bronx Democratic leader , in his Federal trial next month on corruption-related charges. // Mr. Puccio asserted that the " two cornerstones of the prosecution ' s case were rejected by the jury , " and said the convictions that were handed down were on " piddling counts which pertained to very small items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I know Jay McLaughlin and therefore I ' m sorry that he has been found guilty of charges involving his trustee relationship with Ann Maytag , which was outside the scope of his official duties . I am relieved that the jury found no official misconduct or corruption in the discharge of his duties as a city official. " // The one count that related directly to the corruption scandal was the bribery charge , added last April - about seven months after the original indictment . It held that in 1983 Mr. McLaughlin had taken a $150 , 000 bribe from Numed Inc. , a California health consulting concern that was seeking a contract with the city. // The bribery was said to have occurred when he accepted 10 , 000 shares of Numed stock at a sharply discounted price in the name of Ms. Maytag , whom Mr. McLaughlin had served as lawyer and co-trustee from 1979 to 1984. // Most of the case , however , involved Mr. McLaughlin ' s handling of Ms. Maytag ' s multimillion-dollar personal trust , her legacy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The counts on which the jury convicted Mr. McLaughlin were two of grand larceny , for having billed the same expenses to both Ms. Maytag and her son , John C. Poulos ; one of forgery , for having increased to $858 from $355 the amount of an airline ticket he submitted for reimbursement to the Maytag trust , and two of filing a false document , for misstating financial information on his New York City financial disclosure form and a background investigation report submitted to the Department of Investigation. // Justice Rose L. Rubin , who presided over the trial , set sentencing for Sept. 24. // The prosecutor , Michael McManus , an assistant district attorney , called the result " a victory to the extent that the defendant was found guilty of four felonies , " and added , " I have always accepted the fact that jurors will have differing opinions. " // But Mr. McLaughlin dismissed the importance of the charges on which he was convicted . " If a collection agency spends $2 million to get $5 , 000 , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s not very productive. " // On the bribery charge , one juror , Mercie Hinton , a word processor at New York University , said that while some jurors " had misgivings , " they had decided that the evidence was " not overwhelming enough to say he was guilty - we did not feel he took a bribe. " #7 Weeks of Testimony The jury had heard seven weeks of testimony from about 40 witnesses in a trial that produced more than 4 , 000 pages of testimony . Throughout its week of deliberations , the panel repeatedly had sent notes to Justice Rose L. Rubin , who presided over the case , seeking rereadings of testimony , copies of some of the shopping-cart full of documents in evidence and reminders of the judge ' s instructions on the laws involved. // The basic premise of the Government ' s case was that Mr. McLaughlin had stolen some $250 , 000 from Ms. Maytag by diverting her funds and property for his personal use. // The larceny charges centered on Mr. McLaughlin ' s use of money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an interest to purchase property on Greene Street , and his payment to Ms. Maytag of $11 , 450 for an apartment at 80 Warren Street , in lower Manhattan , that was valued at $125 , 000. // The Government also charged that Mr. McLaughlin had used Ms. Maytag ' s funds to travel to and play in golf tournaments and had overbilled her on expenses by forging higher amounts on airline tickets he submitted for reimbursement . <> <> Two Counts Were Dismissed // In all , the grand jury convened by District Attorney Morgenthau had handed up 17 counts in its indictment of Mr. McLaughlin . Justice Rubin dismissed two of the counts before they could be considered by the jury. // Mr. McLaughlin was tried on six counts of grand larceny , one of bribery , four of forgery , two of tax evasion and two of filing a false instrument . Twelve of the counts were felonies ; three were misdemeanors. // Mr. McLaughlin had resigned from his post as president of the hospitals corporation last August , shortly after learning that he was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New York City government since 1981 , first as general counsel of the Health and Hospitals Corporation , then as Commissioner of Financial Services and later as president of the hospitals corporation. //
