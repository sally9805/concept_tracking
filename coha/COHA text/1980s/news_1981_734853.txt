txt ON ENVELOPE has been delivered to this office . Inside'the envelope was a long note from Mike Holiday , a bag boy at the Treasure Island supermarket on Wells Street and author of the best-selling novel " Bagtirne . " Here are the contents of Mike Holiday 's message : WINTER IN CHICAGO does something to me . In the spring and summer and fall I can convince myself that being a bag boy is a romantic way for a guy to spend his life until he hears his true calling . But during the winter I realize that I 'm not getting any younger , and that when the thaw comes in April all my friends from college will have moved one more rung up the career ladder , and I 'll still be at the checkout counter of the Treasure Island . So I guess I was feeling a litticsour last Sunday . I tried to watch the pro football playoff games , but I have to admit , I hate football . I half-listened to the sound of the announcers , and I threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring back to me . I love Helen a lot , but not even playing catch with her could bring me out of my gloomy mood . I went out for a walk in the brisk afternoon air , heading toward'the lake and then in the direction of downtown . Something was on my mind . It 's this television thing . I just found out that Channel 7 , WLS-TV in Chicago , was talking about producing a special pro . gram about my life . Part of me is flattered , of course ; I guess I would n't write these things if I did n't enjoy the attention , and I know that TV attention is the best attention you can get . BUT WHEN I THINK BACK on these last few years , it seems that starting to write the " Bagtime " adventures may have been the worst mistake I ever made . Before I started writing , I led a pretty quiet life . Bag the groceries , go home to my apartment above That Steak Joynt , hang out with Helen . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked it . In 1976 , though , when my stories first started appearing in the newspaper , things started to change . I could n't quite put my finger on it , but my life w4 different . In 1977 , when the " Bagtime " book came out , it got even stranger , and by 1979 , when the musical comedy was presented , it had gotten out of ' Dear Sirs : I found one of your " first Birthday " balloons in my dad 's cornfield . . I just wanted you to know that God 's wind brought your balloon all the way to my house on Underridge Road , in Conneaut , Ohio . ' hand . I felt like selling my life was becoming more important than living my life ; I could n't have an experience without thinking about how people would react when they read about it . So as f walked downtown and thought about the TV thing , part of me hoped it would work out , and part of me hoped it would n't . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Tower Place . I rode the escalator up to the 7th floor , and went into D.B. Kaplan 's for a beer . THERE WAS A WOMAN on the next stool at the bar . She was reading a postcard ; her eyes seemed to be a little teary , and I was concerned . I asked her if something was wrong . " Oh . . " she said , surprised to hear someone talking to her . " No . This is just so sweet . " We both went back to our beers , and after a few seconds ' awkward silence , she talked to me again . She said that her name was Stephanie Hauptfuhrer , and that she did public relations for a place called Off Center , which is , a shopping mall of specialty shops in a warehouse near the Merchandise Mart . In November , she said , Off Center had celebrated its first anniversary . Part of the publicity effort included sending off helium ballons celebrating the birthday . Miss Hauptfuhrer said that she had been concerned with getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was over she had gone on to her next assignment . Last week , though , Off Center had received the postcard in the mail , and now she was reading it . It was postmarked Conneaut , Ohio . " WE ALL GET SO Involved In our business lives . " Miss Hauptfuhrer said to me . " And then you get something like this . " The postcard was handwritten . It said : " Dear Sirs : " I found one of your ' First Birthday ' balloons in my dad 's cornfield . Congratulations ! " I am 7 years old and in the second grade at Chestnut Street school . I just wanted you to know that God 's wind brought your balloon all the way to my house on Underridge Road , in Conneaut , Ohio . " ( signed ) " Sammy Ring . " I read the postcard a couple of times . I understood what Miss Hauptfuhrer was feeling . The same way it had made her feel foolish for spending so much time thinking about deadlines and business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turns my own life has taken , and may take in the future . The bartender , Rick Helland , asked what I was reading . I showed him the postcard . He read it . Then he poured a fresh beer for me , and one for Miss Hauptfuhrer , and one for himself . We did n't say anything . We just lifted our glasses and , on a cold winter afternoon in Chicago , we toasted Sammy Ring , and his father 's cornfield , and , Most of all , God 's wind .
