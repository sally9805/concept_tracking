In his 15 years as chairman and chief executive of General Dynamics , David S. Lewis , 67 , helped turn the company into one of America 's most important defense contractors . The firm builds the Trident nuclear submarine and the sophisticated F-16 fighter aircraft . In recent months , though , General Dynamics has been awash in charges of millions of dollars in overbilling on Government contracts and allegations of fraud . Congress and the Department of the Navy have both launched investigations of company practices . During all the troubles , Lewis firmly maintained that he would not resign under fire , but last week he announced his retirement . <P> Only the day before Lewis said he would step down , Navy Secretary John F. Lehman levied a fine and penalties against General Dynamics for " a pervasive corporate attitude . . . inappropriate to the public trust . " The fine was $676,283.30 , ten times the amount of gratuities that the company gave Admiral Hyman Rickover , 85 . For three decades , Rickover was the boss of the Navy 's nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at General Dynamics ' Electric Boat Division in Groton , Conn . Lehman also took two Navy contracts worth $22.5 million away from the company , and will reopen them to competitive bidding . Finally , the Navy announced that it would hold up several General Dynamics contracts , including one for construction of the next Trident submarine , until it is satisfied that the company has established a code of ethics for its employees and taken action toward settling $75 million in overhead payments disputed by the Navy . <P> As Pentagon punishments go , the penalties were rather mild . Tiny Alamo Aircraft Supply of San Antonio handed out hams and bottles of whisky to Government employees at Christmas , but the Pentagon last year ruled that those gifts were improper and barred the company from all Defense Department work for three years . Lehman 's sanctions were not as strong as those recommended in April by Joseph H. Sherick , the Pentagon 's inspector general . He had proposed suspending General Dynamics ' top three officers from doing business with the Pentagon . <P> Congressional critics chastised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual in dealing with large defense contractors . Wisconsin Democrat William Proxmire told the Senate , " Small contractors who are caught committing questionable or wrongful acts are pinned to the wall . Larger companies typically are slapped on the wrist at most . " Michigan Democrat John Dingell , who chaired the House subcommittee that unearthed the gifts to Rickover , said the General Dynamics decision reflected the differences between large and small contractors . The little ones , he said , do not have the U.S. " as hostages . "
