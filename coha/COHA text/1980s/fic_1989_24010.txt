STORY WHEN I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS By Jane Hamilton My uncle says he has to feed me . Otherwise , he says , my brain will shrivel and rot and one day slip to the floor , and no one will notice because there will be no noise . He laughs and I laugh , but my fear is genuine . I try to improve my mind because I know if my brain fails I will have nothing : I look exactly like my father . Still , my mother tells me that in two years it will be my turn to be in the Miss Beaver Dam Beauty Pageant . It was this summer when my sister Kelly took her turn in the pageant that all the brain food my uncle had been dishing out suddenly became intelligible . Not that I had n't had glimmers before . My first conscious glimmer occurred when I was six and Kelly was eight . It was the Fourth of July in our town , which is not Beaver Dam but about eight miles outside city limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother had taught us the song " All Things Bright and Beautiful " and also the deaf signs to go along with it . My sister and I wore identical green-and-blueplaid cotton jumpers and white shirts with plaid piping along the collar and cuffs . It was 103 degrees under the blazing sun . We wore blue anklets and saddle shoes , and we had the same glasses , the kind men who are doing heavy inJane Hamilton 's first novel , The Book of Ruth , published last December by Ticknor &; Fields , won PEN 's Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award . She Imes in Rochester , Wisconsin , dustrial work must wear under order of the law . My mother had given us pixie cuts the day before . She played the piano up on the stage with us , cut in the park , and we chirped , ' ' All things wise and wonderful , /The Lord God made them all . /Each little flower that opens , / Each little bird that sings " ? only something slipped a cog in my even then rotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly a curled dimension uncurled itself and made me sing , " Each little fart that opens ... " My sister jabbed me in the ribs before I knew what had happened , although I had stopped singing because I did n't know how to sign that strange new word . My mother stopped playing and said in her piano teacher voice . " Let 's begin again , girls . " We took deep breaths and sang the song perfectly . No one mentioned my slip , not even Kelly , who has always been good , but in retrospect I understand that the error was in some ways like the big bang , that there was a very tiny but non-negligible probability that an explosion would happen and then it did , and voila , here we are on planet Earth . The same with my goof : the key phrase being " non-negligible probability . " However small the chance , I was bound to sing the wrong word . My mother is baffled by the volurrie of mail my uncle sends me . I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Wisconsin and he 's forever in his lab , but he tells me things I should know and sends me books to read . He promises that no other fifteen-year-old will have a brain like mine if I keep my nose to the grindstone . Until this summer , I understood almost none of the words , and read them only so when he quizzed me I could come up with the answers , Most people say hello when they see me , but my uncle , breaking through the crowd at our family picnic , for example , comes up to me and says , " What role does the observer play in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum reality ? " 1 rack my poor brain . I know better than to smile and giggle and shrug my shoulders like Kelly does . " According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum reality , " I say , stalling , " the observer forces a particle to take a certain path , simply by the act of measuring . " My uncle slaps me on the back and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , you see , until you make a measurement and say , ' This particle passed through Slit A , ' each particle seems to be going through both Slit A and Slit B. That 's what 's called superposition , when a particle exists in both states . " " Uh huh , " my uncle says , reaching into a bag of corn chips . " Explain Erwin SchrOdinger 's famous thought experiment with the cat . " " Urn , " I say , " okay , so you put a cat in a sealed box with a source of radioactive particles and of course you ca n't know if the cat is dead or alive until you look and the whole point is ? " " The sloppy joes are ready , " my mother says . My uncle and 1 are locked into each other 's gaze , me struggling to recite , he looking into my eyes to see if I comprehend . I try Kelly 's trick of blinking a lot . I 'm not sure if it 's working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's feed our budding cosmologist . " " You two are definitely weird , " my mother says , shaking her head as if she has something in her ear . My mother will never understand what goes on between my uncle and me . She ca n't keep herself from asking me the question : " Why are n't you more like Kelly ? " I try to be good , I really do . I try to stand up straight and smile at Pastor Volt ; I try to tease the children in the nursery after church the way Kelly does , so playfully , but it always comes out in a way that must be odd because the children look at me as if I 'm not attached to my body . It is beyond my mother 's dimension that I can spend a Saturday morning in my room reading about the universe . She makes me do things like sign up for the homecoming parade committee , so I can stuff napkins into chicken wire , and keep her company while she watches Knots Landing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do . My uncle has n't said it , but I know he figures being smart is my only hope since I have my father 's bone structure . I have a feeling my uncle knows almost everything . He 's very tall ; he can see over all the heads and he always stands around with his arms folded across his thin chest , watching . When he tells me I 'm beautiful or correct I have a wild urge to run to my room and climb under the covers and beat a saucepan with a wooden spoon . My mother , blind because she is a mother , thinks both of her daughters will capture the Miss America title , and although she is thoroughly committed to the pageant system I think a small part of her secretly wishes it was hooked into the Miss Universe system because you have to admit Miss Universe sounds much better than Miss America . I 'm not like a lot of girls I know : I really love my mother . It 's just that I 'm beginning to understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure how I 'm going to get out of her plans for me . At the quantum level , of course , the edges of things are fuzzy , but for my mother absolutely everything is cut-and-dried . A person behaves . If we do n't set the table we do n't eat . We learn to play two instruments  --  the piano and one of our choice . We go out for track and field . We are home by 5:30 . After dinner we do our homework . Lights-out by ten . If I tried to explain to my mother that it takes sunlight eight minutes to get to the earth , and therefore I should be able to read until 10:08 , she would probably give me that Youare-so-weird look , and then snap off the lights . " I 'm strict because I love you so much , " she says . We audition for Swing Choir whether or not we can sing . Kelly can . I ca n't . At seventeen we enter the Miss Beaver Dam Beauty Pageant . Mostly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought God ran the whole show and that once I got smarter I would be able to understand how the whole deal was set up , that it was there for me to figure out , and ultimately comprehensible . The beauty pageant was where I really got shaken up . We were building toward it all spring and her every word while she accompanied herself and sang , " They said someday you 'll find , i All who love are blind. / When your heart 's on fire , / You must realize / Smoke Gets in Your Eyes . " The only boy I 'd had experience with  --  that is , I talked to him sometimes  --  was Kelly 's boyfriend , Dwight , and I could n't imagine Kelly 's or my heart bursting into flames over scrawny old Dwight . Still , I knew she was singing the song authentically and I never tired of her pure voice and the sweet , sad words . We went to the mall so frequently , in pursuit of the perfect evening gown , that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store we were passing . My mother had her sketch pad neatly obscured in her pocket and she 'd skulk around the dress shops drawing what looked suitable . Then we 'd pile into the car and go home so she could make a pattern while it was still fresh in her memory . Then she 'd make a sort of dummy dress out of old sheets to see if it was worth putting time and money into good material . In the end , for the evening gown competi-tion , Kelly wore her prom dress , slightly done over . It was a deep red shiny material , far far too much red for anyone to swallow whole , with a ruffle around the low-slung neck . I hate to say it , but she looked like a Mylar balloon . Although my mother is a good seamstress , it was painfully obvious that the dress was homemade . It was okay for the prom , but definitely not pageant material . Some of the girls were buying $500 evening gowns , but we kept remembering that the judges pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we were n't worried . As I said , I was still in my Newtonian stage , so 1 did n't truly understand the fact vital to quantum mechanics : the world shifts when it is measured , and this means you ca n't make precise predictions about it . The world is composed of probabilities , rather than definite , fixed states . " What do you mean ? " I had asked the page , when 1 read that the world was composed of probabilities . " You 're going to tell me I could look in the mirror and see a fish where my nose should be ? " After the pageant I knew that such a thing was not impossible . By the middle of June we were all highly agitated . It 's the classic example of counting your chickens before they hatch . We had all nervously sat before the television , watching the Miss Wisconsin Pageant , knowing deep down that Kelly was going to be there in Oshkosh next year , our Miss Beaver Dam . We wanted to wish her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.D. , Cindy Potts , who Kelly 's boyfriend Dwight said was a total dogface . Kelly laughed at this remark and then snuggled up against Dwight 's chest , which was something I found difficult to watch and impossible not to try to look at , a living example , I guess , of Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle . Also , at the end of June , the Pageant Committee started getting the materials ready for the Miss Beaver Dam Pageant Program , a very glossy magazine with the contestants ' photos and histories , and pageant lore . We all wrote well-wishes , to be printed on the page opposite the contestant 's photo and r  --  sum ? . Dwight wrote , " Kelly , to me you are the most beautiful girl in the world . I give you the best of my love , always , and I hope I will be doing so for many , many years to come . " My mother tolerates Dwight , but there is no way he is going to be her son-in-law . If he ever got too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm talking-to . My mother is very effective in her Little Talks . I avoid them at all cost by doing the right thing , as much as I can anticipate what the right thing is . Dwight has no meat on his shoulders or torso , but from the bottom down he 's thick , so it 's hard to know how to describe his whole self . Hepersists in trying to grow a mustache , and I ca n't understand why he does n't realize there is no hope and just quit . From the moment I first saw him , I knew Kelly was too good for him . Of course my opinion is inconsequential : one time I was sitting on the floor watching television and Dwight came in the room and tripped over me . When he collected himself and tried to locate the offending object , and realized it was a person , he squinted at me , wondering , I guess , who in the world I could be . For the pageant program I wrote , " I 'll be your valet when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Luv , your sister Bonnie . " Mike 's Meat Market even wrote " Best Wishes , " and Mom and Dad wrote a thing about how proud they were of Kelly , how they hoped she was having a fantastic experience in the pageant , and getting to know all the girls , and growing , and how happy they were that she was their daughter . Grandma wrote , " To the Winner ! " We wrote enough to fill the whole page . So that got us revved up . Then there were the rehearsals , and buying the outfits for the production numbers , and finding the right swimsuit . My mother taught Kelly how to tape her breasts so they 'd be uplifted and there 'd be some cleavage . And we all watched , especially Dwight , in amazement , when Kelly strutted around the living room in her high heels and her lavender suit . My mother kept clapping the smallest , quickest claps with her hands at her mouth and saying , " I ca n't believe how great you look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a full sixty seconds to contemplate her backside before facing us again . What exactly was my mother seeing ? I know now what the role of the observer is , and that matter takes form only because there is an observer . Probe the world with photons and you see the beautiful Kelly and breakfast on the table . Probe it with , say , neutrinos , those extremely light , probably massless elementary particles , and the world will look like an ocean of subatomic emptiness . I guess it all depends on your perspective . To my mother , Kelly in her swimsuit was pure confection . But I saw things that bothered me , against my will . Kelly had a non-negligible potbelly . Her thighs rubbed together . Her bottom was primarily flat but it puddled down to her thighs and hung there looking just plain sloppy . Her purple heels did n't quite match the suit . Was the world shifting because I was trying to measure it ? I shook my head hard to try to get ahold of myself . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , this was it : the judges give the most weight to the talent portion of the show . There were ten contestants altogether . They really were n't worth talking about . Most of them were blond . They sang or danced or played instruments and had hobbies galore . They collected John Lennon memorabilia and bred boxer dogs and biked and studied French and wanted to be music teachers and physical therapists . Kelly was the only redhead . She was the only one who was under five feet seven , the only one with green eyes and a dimple on her chin . She was almost the only one who did n't have a perm , but my mother panicked at the last minute and sent her to the hairdresser . own outfit and bake for the family party on Sunday , in honor of Kelly . I had nothing to keep my nervous energy in check . I talked to my uncle on the phone for a while , Naturally he grilled me on the grand unified theory and why gravity does n't fit in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " I 'm sorry , but I 'm too nervous to think . Tonight is Kelly 's pageant . " My uncle said , " Christ on a crutch . Poor old Kelly . " " What do you mean ? " I asked . " Listen , " he said , " do n't let your mother put you through it . Do you know what pageant means ? Do you know the root of the word ? " " Ah , " I said . " No . " " In Shakespeare pageant is used as a verb , meaning to imitate , to mimic , but you , Bonnie  --  you are an original  --  you ? " " i have to go , " I said . " You never like anything normal . Do n't tell me you wo n't he proud when Kelly becomes Miss Beaver Dam . " I could n't believe I was talking like my mother to my uncle . ' ' See you soon , " I said , and hung up . My heart was hamming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said but the words had gone in somewhere  --  what had he said about imitating ? For reasons I did n't stop to sort out , I was bothered . At 4:30 I got in the bathtub and soaked . It was terribly hot but I lay there and imagined myself afterward at Stewart 's Supper Club . I imagined myself being there with my sister , the queen . Boys might ask me to dance , simply because of the association . Of course 1 would say no because I hate to dance and I do n't know how , which is one of the things my mother has Talked with me about : how sometimes you have to learn to do things you do n't like to get on in life . Still , their asking , and my saying no , and the buffet filled with baloney and olives speared with toothpicks  --  it all thrilled me . Kelly would be so happy , dancing with Dad , and my mother would be ecstatic ; she 'd sit at the head table all night long while people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those spotlights they do on neat families in the community . My mother would tell them how close we are and they 'd take a picture of us around the piano , my mother sitting with her hands splayed over the keys , Kelly standing beside her with her violin , me with my trombone , and my dad with his hands on my mother 's shoulders . I fell asleep in the tub . When the door opened and banged against the towel rack l opened my eyes . My mother looked hard at me and said if she 'd known I was going to look like a prune she would n't have gone to the trouble of making me a new dress . We got there early and put our programs on the seats in the front row . Then we walked around and examined the decorations up close . The gym had been transformed . The theme was " Born in the U S of A ! " The Pageant Committee had erected trellises up on the stage and on both sides of the gym , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over them , and at each entrance there were enormous wire baskets , the size of silos , filled with more balloons . The floor had a new coat of wax on it , and you could see yourself in a wavery sort of way . The spotlights were poised like cannons at the back , and the folding chairs were set up in perfect lines , like the grave markers at Arlington . My mother grabbed my hand and whispered , " I wonder how she 's doing . " She squeezed my fingers and we both shut our eyes and grimaced . My father was outside having a cigarette . At long last I took my place next to the piano player , Mrs. Pinigus , who helped me out by nodding every time she wanted me to turn the page , so I did n't have to pay too much attention . The gym went dark , and the crowd instantly hushed . Mrs. Pinigus played the tinkling intro. and then in the circle of a single spotlight they started coming out from behind the side curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up to their red garters , and then the rest of their selves followed . They were wearing what we had shopped around so hard to find : cranberry pumps , cranberry leotards , navy blue skirts , cranberry-and-aqua flag scarves around their necks , gigantic blue ball earrings , and blue bowler hats . Kelly was #7 . She was smaller than the others , but she was sending off sparks exactly like a star immediately after its initial hydrogen explosion . There was no mistaking her voice as she belted , " I 'm proud , I 'm proud , I 'M PROUD to be from the U S of A ! " Her teeth were straighter and whiter and much more enormous than they 'd appeared at the breakfast table . She looked like she might be able to devour us all in one mouthful . She did the cancan and then skipped up to the front , giving us a minute to take all of her in , and then she sassily turned her back on us . I had the urge to hug Mrs. Pinigus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being alive . Kelly onstage did that to a person  --  her gift was raw energy and affirmation . I had to shiver after she disappeared behind the curtain , taking her radiance into the shadows . The hosts for the pageant were a former Miss Northshore and her husband , Don . They make a living going around hosting pageants and judging and making new rules . Miss Northshore was glamorous in a mature beauty queen way , although the single sweep of blond curl down the side of her face looked as if it was no longer hair but had been replaced by some more durable material . Don looked completely comfortable in his white tux with the pale pink cummerbund to match her pink sequined gown . They sang " You 're the Top , " and they nuzzled noses at the end of the song and then kissed , which for some reason made my stomach do a flip . They spent a lot of time welcoming us and thanking everybody and introducing the judges , and apparently I was jiggling my legs again because Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me still . I slapped my hand to my mouth and she smiled . She understood it was my nerves . finally it was time to introduce the contestants . This was the part of the pageant where the girls come out in fabulous outfits and say a few sentences to let us get to know them . Out came #1 , Lesley Anne Meyers , looking like a tramp in a red miniskirt and a V-necked cashmere sweater . Her teeth were tiny and pointed , like a weasel 's . She came to the mike and said in a scared high voice , " Dreams really do come true . People who succeed in their work find circumstances to suit them . " What a dumb thing to say ! She cocked her head and smirked and sailed out under the arch . I endured the next five , who said nothing more profound than gobbledygook , and then out came Kelly . She was wearing the black knit top Mom found for her at Target on sale , and the black-and-white polka-dotted skirt that was all bunched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls was tied in a knot and she was wearing awfully high black heels . She got to the mike , flashed us all a seductive grin , and then she looked us straight in the eye . " Caring and seeing with the heart is as important as knowledge . I wish to be like no other woman in history . I wish to be myself . " She winked and then walked through the trellis arch like she had all the time in the world . Everyone clapped their hands off . Dwight was in the back whistling with his thumb and his first finger in his mouth . The whistle split through the applause and said in its continuous screech what we were all thinking : Kelly , you 're a genius , you 're beautiful , GO FOR IT ! After they all finished their sentences I was clapping so wildly to try and blow off some steam I did n't notice the apparition onstage . The applause was cut short , so I looked up . There was the old Miss Beaver Dam , Cindy Potts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black sequined gown in a patch of silver light . When we all realized who it was , we involuntarily rose up clapping , before she 'd even done a thing . Do n't ask me how she got where she was , because she clearly did n't come out of the mold right . Her lips were so skinny and her mouth so small her mother is probably still to this day cutting up chunks of apple for her . She had an enormous nose , which I 'm not going to carry on about because mine is probably bigger than hers ; black eyes too close together ; and a crop of black hair penned to stand on end in half-formed curls . She sang " Over the Rainbow " dolefully . This was the last time she would sing to an audience as Miss Beaver Dam . I felt the weight of it , for a minute , until I remembered who was going to be wearing that crown in one short hour . The crowd rose up again in appreciation . She did have a good voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , okay , " 1 said to myself . " Thank you and good riddance . " Don and Miss Northshore slunk back out , and Don announced , " My favorite part of the pageant is coming right up . " " Not so fast , " Miss Northshore said . " You know the pageant gods in Atlantic City are thinking about doing away with the swimsuit portion . " Don looked stricken and said , " Over my dead body . " While they goaded each other , I prayed for Kelly to suck in her belly and for her eighteen-hour girdle to do its job for just five minutes . Mrs. P in igus started playing the slow romantic music that weaves all over the keyboard , and the girls began their interminable walk from the back of the stage , the pause before the judges , and then the long rear view , and around again , and then to the exit with their heads turned to the audience , smiling beyond their natural capacity even though no one was going to bother looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her as I wanted . She did n't have one of those suits that are cut up over the hips , because although I hate to dwell on it , Kelly does have a little excess in her hips and thighs . I could hear her nylons rubbing together as she walked ; I could see the fold of blubber at her waist . She was tottering on her high heels , as if the weight of her breasts was going to make her fall on her face . I closed my eyes and listened to Don talk about Kelly , about how wonderfully she plays the piano and how many firsts she has taken at the state music contest , about her volunteer work at the hospital ( which my mother makes her do , against her will , and which I will have to do next year ) , about her wins in track and field , and the National Honor Society . I thought of how mymother loves to tell the stories , time and time again , of Kelly spontaneously singing both verses of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months old , of Kelly ordering Dad to return me to the hospital when I was five days old , Kelly tap-dancing at the Senior Center when she was six and kissing all the old ladies with warts and no teeth . I opened my eyes and looked up at Kelly 's continental rear end , and then she turned around . Her ruby lips looked as if they were a neon diner sign on the highway at night -- I swear her smile was that dazzling  --  and l could n't help yelling " YAY KELLY ! " When I realized I had made a fair amount of noise I ducked my head and then looked over at my mother . She was frowning and shaking her head . As a page turner I was part of the performance and was n't supposed to be partial . By the time the talent portion came , I had no feeling in my hands , so I was having a terrible time turning the pages . We had a long wait for # 7 . No one before Kelly was astonishing , except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not distinguishable as Rachmaninoff , and I know him well because my mother teaches piano , and by the time you 're in high school and any good at all she assigns this piece . Melissa massacred the i man had to stop in the middle and completely butchered the end . She was a goner , without a doubt . It was so painful to watch that Mrs. Pinigus put her head down and clutched her nose with her two fists . Lesley Anne Meyers fudged the entrance to " Send in the Clowns " but pretended that everything was perfect . The ballet dancer was n't even on toe , and the other singers were so negligible that I forgot what they sang the instant after they stopped . And then it was Kelly 's turn . She came out in her black silk pants and a sleek green shirt , which was loose . It rippled when she moved . She sang " Smoke Gets in Your Eyes " as if someone had just put a knife through her heart . She moaned a little before she even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over , I heard it as if for the first time . Kelly taught me right then and there what love is all about  --  nothing more or less than total loss followed by unbearable pain that never quits . She swayed , and her pants followed her legs and her green shirt shuddered . Tears sprang into my eyes and sat there until I blinked , and they spilled over onto my lap . She had it in the bag and everyone in that room knew it . By intermission my mother 's excitement had reached a feverish pitch . Her friends were swarming around her reaching for her hands and shaking them . ' ' Kelly will surely place , " they told her and my mother and I modestly nodded in agreement . My mother giggled nervously and said , " Let 's just hope she does n't blow evening gown . " Mrs. Pinigus assured her there was no chance . " I 'm going outside before this heat affects my brain , " I said . My mother paid no attention . I slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asphalt looked soft and steamy in the dim light , as if it were in danger of melting . I stood against the redbrick school and closed my eyes . I honestly did n't know if I was going to make it to the crowning . Although I knew there was no question about the future queen , the suspense was killing me . I tried to empty my head , to fill it with nothingness , but I could n't help hearing a familiar voice . I tried to block it out , but it kept coming back to me . " She bites . Hard . " " She bites ? " someone asked the voice . " She 's crazy for it . You should hear her sweet-talking her mother , telling her " at this point the voice went up an octave ? " ' Yes , Mom , we 'll be home by midnight , Mom , we 're going to the eight o'clock movie and out for ice cream and then he has to drop off a loaf of bread by his grandma 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister  --  we call her the Nun  --  wave at us and the minute we 're at the end of the driveway she dives for my pants . She 's crazy for it . " 1 realized that the voices were coming from around the corner and up above , from the fire escape . " Like , like last time we went out , she put on that polka-dotted skirt number she was wearing for her sentence thing tonight , and she was attacking me in the backseat of the Vega  --  she was saying ' God Dwight , Yes Dwight , Sweet Jesus Dwight , Oh harder , harder , ' and when she climbed off me , guess what she says ? She says , Now you know what it 's like to screw a ladybug ; all ass and wings , ass and wings ' because of the wild skirt she had on . " " Sheeeit , " the other voice said . " And then we go home , and there 's her mom and the Nun , wearing some party dress  --  watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week . And her mom says to us , ' How was the movie , kids ? What kind of ice cream did you have ? ' " The voices laughed . I stood there for a second watching the moths bang and bang against the exit light . The voiceswere laughing and laughing . 1 felt my dress . It was still on my body . I walked back into the gym and sat down at the piano . The air was thick with perfume and hair spray and I had to clutch at the piano to keep from suffocating and falling over . When I got my balance I reached up and pulled the bow out of my hair and slipped it underneath me . The lights went down and Miss Beaver Dam sang her third farewell song . Her black dress made her look like the flat dead salamanders in the drain in our basement . Mrs. Pinigus fumbled at the sheet music while bit my bottom lip and tried to hold on to the piano bench . The next time I noticed , they were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joking around because the judges were having trouble making up their minds . Finally an old man with a tobacco-stained mustache and thick glasses handed an envelope to Don . It struck me in that moment of exchange that life is hideous : what right did these blind old men have to judge beauty ? I felt violently ill for a second , and then the feeling passed to steady nausea . The contestants were in a straight line , up front , holding each other 's hands and trying to be still . They were all smiling so hard they looked mad . The first award , Miss Congeniality , is decided by the girls themselves . Sheila Dart , the girl who raises boxers and did n't dance on toe , came forward to receive the award . She kept her smile plastered on her face even though we all knew she was hoping for more . Mrs. Pinigus played a drumroll on the piano as Don announced the third runner-up . He said , " Step right up , Melissa Campo ! " What ? She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was more unbelievable was how disappointed she looked . She came to the front and grabbed her certificate . My uncle 's small silent words were whirling around in my head , getting larger as they came into focus and finding each other to make sentences , and then stopping right up front and shouting at me : The fact that the world shifts when it is measured means simply that you can not make precise predictions about it . This is the cornerstone of quantum mechanics . Its implications are dire . Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle tells us that things are n't as they seem . Sometimes it is useful to think of particles as waves , and when it 's useful we think of waves as particles . I was n't feeling at all well . One can only predict a number of different possible outcomes , each with their own likelihood . The floor was slipping under my feet and I grabbed at the black keys in front of me . Onstage the girls were still squeezing each other 's hands and waiting . Mrs. Pinigus did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runner-up will receive a trophy and a scholarship donated by Carson Rubber . And she is , Tina Otto ! " Tina Otto , the girl whose brain weighs slightly more than a dust ball . " And now , " Don was saying , " the first runner-up , the lady who will assume Miss Beaver Dam 's position should anything , God forbid , happen to her , and who will receive a scholarship donated by the Can Corporation , and a trophy . The winner is ... Lesley Anne Meyers . " Was I experiencing space and time before the big bang singularity , where predictability breaks down ? Had something so large happened out in the universe that we had failed to feel it ? I could n't keep my mind on what was making me sickest . Lesley Anne hugged the girls next to her and wriggled up to the front . I guess she was genuinely pleased , because she knew she had blown her entrance to " Send in the Clowns " and under normal circumstances would n't have expected to place . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One swift jab of the kitchen knife and she could have the crown . " Well , shall we go home now ? " Don asked Miss Northshore . She stamped her foot and swatted his arm . " Oh , all right , " he said . " I 'll announce the queen . " He yawned and stretched . " And now , " Don said , " for the coronation of Miss Beaver Dam 1988 . " Mrs. Pinigus played her dinner club music . " Miss Beaver Dam 1988 will receive a gift certificate from Diane 's Dress Shop , a complete wardrobe for the Miss Wisconsin Pageant , modeling sessions at Tres Chic , and a scholarship from the Beaver Dam Lionesses and Lions Club . Are we all ready ? " The audience groaned . My mother had rolled up her program and I knew if there was any further delay she was going to personally march onstage and club Don to death . " The title of Miss Beaver Dam 1988 goes to ... Kelly Brooks ! " Mrs. Pinigus threw her arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 sat perfectly still in the crook of her vibrating arm . My uncle 's words screamed at me inside my idiotic head : The world 's attributes seem to vary depending on the vantage point of the observer , somewhat like the location of a wave . I understood everything . We were in this gym and we were not in this gym , somewhat like the location of a rainbow . " Is n't she lovely ? " Mrs. Pinigus murmured . No , she was not lovely . She was  --  she was a slut . I looked up and there she was , with too much makeup on and a smile that had somehow gotten twisted with overuse . I always knew I could never be beautiful like Kelly , but I had tried so hard to be good . It all was so clear that I started to cry . The blue paint from South Pacific on the trellis had n't been covered up properly , the BORN IN THE U S OF A sign had gotten bumped and half of it was down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone was clapping . Kelly was trying to cry and hugging Miss Northshore as Cindy Potts struggled to pin the crown into Kelly 's hair . When the crown was secure Kelly came to the front smiling the terrible smile that looked as if it was going to sit there on her face permanently . She stood waving at the crowd , sniffling . My mother was standing motionless with her hands to her face . My father was heading out the door for a cigarette . We were the perfect normal family , vanishing into thin air . I stumbled over to my mother after the lights came on . My stomach was killing me . I begged her to take me home , and she stamped her foot and snorted , and then my face must have impressed her because she said , " Good Lord , you look awful . What 's the matter with you ? " Before I could say , " Absolutely nothing , " she hooked her elbow around my neck and pulled me to her mouth , and then she whispered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dwight drive Kelly and my father to the reception in Dwight 's car . She would meet them there after driving me home . On the way , she chattered about how smart the judges were , how well the committee ran the pageant , about how wonderfully Kelly had performed . " For once , " my mother said , " the judges really knew enough to judge every category . " Maybe yes , maybe no . I could have told her those old men did n't know anything , that they were senile and blind , but I kept quiet . Rain spattered our windshield and the night inside our van was hot and dark and close . My mother parked and made a dash for the house . Slowly I climbed out . I stood on the gravel looking up into the sky . " Get out of the rain , " my mother yelled from the porch . " Do n't you know any better ? " I looked at her , safe and relatively dry , spinning through time and space , if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water trickled into the puffs of my sleeves . I used to love coming home from band practice after dark and standing right here on the driveway , looking into the house with just one light on at the piano , seeing Kelly 's head barely moving as she played some crazy Beethoven sonatas . I took off my pink pumps and headed for the marsh , 1 knew in my heart that everything had collapsed , but I wanted to feel the cold scummy dirt on my bare feet anyway . I was wondering if , by any small chance , the earth was still solid enough to hold me. ?
