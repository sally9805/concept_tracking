Whether it was just a minor rumble or a major tremor on the political Richter scale , last week 's vote for the upper house of Japan 's parliament was certainly a shock to the Liberal Democratic Party , which has ruled the country for 34 years . In the most devastating setback in its history , the L.D.P. claimed only 36 of the 126 seats up for grabs , while the underdog Japan Socialist Party took 46 . Declared exultant J.S.P. leader Takako Doi : " I truly felt the mountains moving . " <P> The vote gave the combined forces of Japan 's opposition parties control of one of the houses in the Diet for the first time . Although the L.D.P. maintains control of the more powerful lower house , and therefore of the government , the defeat threw into question the party 's continued dominance . Prime Minister Sousuke Uno promptly resigned his post after only two months , saying , " The entire responsibility for the defeat lies with me . " <P> Uno 's willingness to shoulder the party 's disgrace did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week on the potential consequences of the voter backlash , they did concur on the causes of the L.D.P. rout . The vote amounted to a referendum on the party 's arrogant and scandal-tainted performance in recent months . The downslide began with a bribery and influence-peddling scandal that forced the resignation of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita last April . The L.D.P. further alienated voters , especially women , by imposing a controversial 3% consumption tax . In agreeing to liberalize agricultural imports , the party angered farmers , long the chief pillar of its support . The final straw came just weeks after Uno was named Prime Minister , when his supposedly spotless reputation was soiled by revelations of a paid affair with a geisha . " Along the way , " says Katsuhiko Shirakawa , an L.D.P. legislator , " we lost sight of what the public was demanding . " <P> During the campaign , the L.D.P. repeatedly demonstrated just how out of touch it had become . One L.D.P. legislator suggested that the consumption tax would be less painful if it were an even 4% instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent enough to do manual work . Credit for the greatest blunder , however , went to Agriculture Minister Hisao Horinouchi , who said , " It is wrong for women to come to the forefront of politics . " Pausing just long enough to take one foot out of his mouth and insert the other , Horinouchi then attacked Doi , the popular Socialist leader . " British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is an exception , but she has a husband and children , " Horinouchi asserted . " Doi does not . Can such a person serve as Prime Minister ? " <P> Seizing on voter disillusionment , the J.S.P. mounted a stunningly effective campaign . Its trump card was Doi , a charismatic politician whose forthright statements and energy offered a refreshing change from the dour-faced , dark- suited politicians fielded by the L.D.P. Campaigning vigorously , Doi and her opposition colleagues promised to rescind the consumption tax and oppose further liberalization of farm imports . " The people are aware of how politics affects their daily life , " Doi said during a campaign tour . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
