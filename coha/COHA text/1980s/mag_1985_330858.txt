In the hardy tradition of laughing in the face of adversity , many Northeastern residents allowed as how it was unusual , almost fun , to go without electricity for a day or two after Hurricane Gloria . But eight or nine ? At the end of last week , large numbers of those same citizens still could not use their refrigerators , electric pumps or televisions . While power had been restored to more than 2 million customers , some 100,000 in New York , Connecticut , Rhode Island and Massachusetts remained in the dark , and the novelty of making do had worn off . <P> In Massachusetts , residents of Brockton marched against the local office of Edison Electric . Rhode Island Governor Edward DiPrete ordered an investigation of utilities ' storm readiness , while Long Islanders fumed over the fact that the chairman of Lilco , the often bumbling local utility , was holidaying in Europe while they groped in the dark . In desperation Lilco distributed 100 tons of dry ice to residents who were watching their food spoil . All told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news organizations , but its misery was prolonged .
