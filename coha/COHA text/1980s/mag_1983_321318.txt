Two exhibitions enliven a dwindling bill of fare <P> As the temperature soars , the New York City art world winds down . Early summer is the time for group shows , mixed hangings , tail ends of the year . Yet now and again , it contains some interesting items ; even a few revelations . Two such shows , having nothing but dates in common , can be picked from Manhattan 's dwindling bill of fare . One is a downtown exhibition of works on paper by the Kansas-born artist Alan Shields , 39 ; the other , at the Marlborough Gallery on 57th Street , is the promising second New York show of a painter from the Southwest , John Alexander . <P> Born in 1945 , Alexander was raised in Texas swamp country-Beaumont , near the Louisiana border . One might not deduce that from his work but , with a little hindsight , the paintings suggest it . They have a marshy , embrangled look full of thickets of line and pools of darkness . Their peculiar sense of space ( which looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is recognizable at once to anyone who has gone through swamp : no horizon to be seen , only a succession of angles that , when the eye pushes through them , disclose more tangles beyond . The light is murky . Such color as is there is local-a flurry of pink , a sudden network of vermilion slashes . Otherwise it is all bog color , glazed browns reflecting other browns , dank mossy greens , thick in tone . <P> This recipe could hardly be less like the ideal clarity and openness of traditional American abstract painting . It sounds like a terrible mess , but it does not cook out that way , for two reasons . The first is the strength of Alexander 's imagery ; the second , his formal control . Since most neoexpressionist painting is given to conventional signs for intensity but lacks formal rigor ( a gut pile without shape ) , Alexander 's work repays inspection . <P> It is weird , edgy stuff , raucous and paranoid by turns . On one side it descends from the Cuban artist Wifredo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bone-were a significant , though now unfashionable , part of the impact surrealism made on New York in the 1940s . On the other it comes out of a native , down-home strand of buckeye humor , folk forms that verge unconsciously on surrealism : tall Texan stories and Bible Belt grotesqueries . A zoo of critters lurks in Alexander 's paintings : snakes preying on rats , rats eyeing scrofulous cats , and so on up the food chain to leopards and a large stag , whose rack of antlers has a horrified , spiky erectness . We are shown a teeming , hostile world where everything studies the next species with blood or hunger in its eye ; these acts of watching are traced out with lines , zapping like lasers-or the emblems of stigmatization in Sassetta 's Saint <P> Francis-between eye and eye . Fish float in the sky , evoking the early Christian ichthys ; a wretched tar baby hangs on a crucifix . It is a moralizing vision , as the grotesque ought to be : Alexander 's art has always had a strong political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
