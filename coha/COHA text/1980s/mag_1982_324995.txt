One of the most bizarre shortages that may result from the Reagan defense buildup concerns a man-made mineral that many people feel is already in all too abundant supply : plutonium , a uranium byproduct used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons . The Reagan defense budget calls for stepped-up production of the ground , sea-and air-launched cruise missile and the Navy 's Trident II submarine-based missile , as well as deployment of the MX missile system . Most of these weapons will be tipped with nuclear warheads . <P> With an average of 15 Ibs. of the silver-white , highly toxic metal needed for each warhead , the Reagan plan will require upwards of 130 tons of weapons-grade plutonium to build the 17,000 or so new warheads that defense specialists estimate will be added to the U.S. nuclear arsenal by the mid-1990s . But according to congressional testimony earlier this year by F. Charles Gilbert , an Energy Department nuclear expert , the lack not only of plutonium but also of tritium , an associated radioactive gas , threatens eventually to present " a serious problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockpiles are , but consideration is being given to construction of two new plutonium production reactors alongside plants currently operating in Savannah River , S.C. , and Hanford , Wash . Neither project is expected to be completed before 1990 , and the eventual cost is estimated by one weapons authority to be " fantastically expensive-in the billions . " <P> The manufacture and assembly of nuclear weapons are bid out to private suppliers , as is the case with every other item in the U.S. defense arsenal . Final assembly takes place in a spread of low buildings , protected by guard dogs and a high cyclone fence , that range over several acres north of Amarillo , Texas . The heavily guarded facility is owned by the Department of Energy , but the day-to-day business of building warheads and bombs at the site is the responsibility of the little-known Kentucky-based engineering firm of Mason &; Hanger-Silas Mason Co . <P> The companies that perform this sensitive work are reluctant to talk about whether they can produce nuclear weapons in the quantities wanted . Independent observers are much less reticent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street 's Bache Halsey Stuart Shields : " Capacity will be challenged across the board . " Adds Rob Laufer , editor of Nucleonics Week , an industry newsletter : " Plutonium is the critical issue . "
