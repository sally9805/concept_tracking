The first gray-brown stains appeared in the azure skies above Los Angeles before the outset of World War I. During World War II , the summer haze was beginning to sting the eyes and shroud the mountains that ring the city . By the mid- ' 50s , Los Angeles ' smog , as the noxious vapor had been dubbed , was sufficiently thick and persistent to wilt crops , obstruct breathing and bring angry housewives into the streets waving placards and wearing gas masks . Oil companies were urged to cut sulfur emissions . Cars were required to use unleaded gas , and exhausts were fitted with catalytic converters . But as the city continued to grow unabated , so did its choking smog . <P> Now , after more than 30 years of struggling to clean up what has become the nation 's No. 1 air-pollution problem , California officials have taken decisive action against the primary source of the trouble : the unfettered use of fossil-fuel-burning private vehicles in a city that has long been in love with the automobile . By a vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air- quality-management district , a regional agency with authority over Los Angeles , last week adopted a sweeping 20-year antipollution plan . It will not only drastically curtail automobile use in the Los Angeles basin but also convert virtually all vehicles to the use of nonpolluting fuels by 2009 . " The public is ready for change , " declares Jim Lents , executive officer of the management district . " This plan signals the beginning of that process . " <P> The proposal , referred to simply as the L.A. plan , is 5,500 pages long and 3 ft. high , and was five years in the making . It calls for elimination of 70% of smog-producing emissions in the Los Angeles area by the year 2000 . In the plan 's first five-year phase , 123 separate regulations will ban the use of aerosol hair sprays and deodorants and require companies , regardless of the cost , to install the best antismog equipment available . But one of the plan 's primary objectives is to break the city 's addiction to the internal-combustion engine . First , it imposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then it calls for conversion of most vehicles to methanol and other cleaner burning fuels . Finally , in a Buck Rogers phase that assumes rapid advances in fuel-cell technology , it calls for a massive switch to cars , buses and trucks powered by electricity . <P> " It 's quite a remarkable achievement , " says David Howekamp of the Environmental Protection Agency . Adds Richard Ayres , chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition : " It 's a bold attempt to grapple with the real pollution problems . " The EPA is expected to approve the Los Angeles plan and use it as a blueprint for a federal program that will include cities like Chicago and New York .
