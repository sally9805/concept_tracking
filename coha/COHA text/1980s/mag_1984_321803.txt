I 've got a mule ; her name is Sal . <P> Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal . <P> - American folk song Captain Olaf Kaldefoss does not have a mule to pull his boat through the Erie Canal . He has a pair of 25-year-old diesel engines , one of which has just been overhauled . But he is confident that they can move his craft , the 256-ft . M.V. Day Peckinpaugh , through the canal at a stately , steady speed of 8 m.p.h. , and so is the ship 's engineer , a compact , muscular fellow named Dan Sauvey . So , with the sun just clearing the horizon and beginning to burn off the mist shrouding the upstate New York city of Utica , Kaldefoss signals his crew to cast off the lines holding his command to the New York State department of transportation dock and eases it slowly , stern-first , out into the basin . Then , his craft clear , Kaldefoss settles himself behind the huge , spoked steering wheel that dominates the Peckinpaugh 's pilothouse and steers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 338-mile-long liquid highway that runs from Buffalo , on Lake Erie , all the way east to Albany on the Hudson River . " Well , " says Kaldefoss in a voice still heavy with the cadences of his native Norway , " here we go again . " <P> Kaldefoss 's statement is one of fact , not resignation . The only commercial ship still plying that route , the Peckinpaugh has made more than 30 trips so far this year between the industrial city of Rome , located near the center of the state , and the Lake Ontario port of Oswego . It makes the trip west and north empty , completing the run in about 16 hours . It makes the trip back loaded with some 1,600 tons of cement . And the ship does it cheaply , carrying its high-bulk , low-cost cargo for less than the cost of sending it by either train or truck , which is , Kaldefoss explains , why the vessel is still working . Commercial traffic on the Erie Canal has all but disappeared ; the Erie Navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peckinpaugh , is one of the last shippers still using the water route across New York . But the Peckinpaugh and its eight-man crew remain and , more important , pay their way . " This is n't an exhibit in a museum , " says Kaldefoss as the gates of the harbor lock swing open to receive him and his ship . " This is a real working boat . " <P> That the Peckinpaugh is no pleasure craft is evident . Built in 1921 and named for a Great Lakes coal shipper whose brother Roger once managed the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians , the Peckinpaugh was drafted into service during World War II to carry coal offshore , and made several runs to Cuba . But then it was restored to its original purpose , which was to run the still waters of the canal . <P> That it has a working crew becomes clear as the boat enters the lock . With practiced ease , Deck Hand Basil Kuvshinikov , whose name and accent both attest to his origins in the Russian city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , a loop of its thick forward hawser over his shoulder . As he slips the loop over one of the mushroom-shaped bollards onshore , another deck hand , a stocky , bearded man named Tim Burke , tightens the line , snubbing the Peckinpaugh to the side of the lock . <P>
