Michael and Kitty Dukakis have in a year experienced an extraordinary fall from grace . Sixteen months ago , they stood , a charmed political pair , before a roaring Democratic Convention . Today they struggle to hold together their public and private lives . <P> In Massachusetts , Dukakis has become an object of political scorn . The Governor who boasted repeatedly during the 1988 presidential campaign of balancing ten budgets in a row is drowning in red ink . His credibility is shot . Legislators he once controlled dismiss him as irrelevant . Rarely has a lustrous reputation sunk so far so fast . <P> Last week , just a day before the anniversary of his lopsided defeat by George Bush , Dukakis ' woes turned more personal . His wife , a recovering alcoholic , was rushed semiconscious to a Boston hospital , where her stomach was pumped . Kitty Dukakis had in a desperate and irrational act downed some rubbing alcohol . These days liquor is forbidden in the Dukakis home . At first Kitty tried to conceal the real story , but two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring she was suffering from exhaustion and depression . Kitty , the statement explained , had lately been taking antidepressants , a perilous mix with alcohol of any sort . <P> Her husband had seemed able to weather the punishing year , but Kitty found the return to stricken Massachusetts far harder to take . She sorely missed the attention and glitter of the campaign . In February , a few months after the election defeat , she decided on her own to declare publicly that she was an alcoholic . Two years earlier , Kitty had revealed a lifetime dependence on diet amphetamines . <P> Early this year she began speaking out eagerly on the issue of substance abuse . Her schedule of public appearances soon quickened . Elegant and direct in front of audiences , Kitty was in enthusiastic demand . She whisked off to speak in the Midwest , then to Greece and back in 72 hours , then out again across the country . Her distraught husband watched in alarm . He knew well his wife 's deep insecurities . " Kitty ca n't stand being out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know what to do . " <P> There was little he really could do . Over the years , Kitty had mostly set her own course . Aides remember her as an intimidating figure at the statehouse , where she claimed an office a few doors from her husband 's . Often she threw her weight around , berating secretaries or barging unannounced into the Governor 's corner office during meetings to ask personal questions . Never did Dukakis rebuke her openly . Usually he withheld delicate information from her . Kitty was too prone to spilling secrets . <P> The presidential contest over , Kitty 's interest in state affairs dwindled . Her stage by now was bigger . A New York publisher paid her a large advance to write a book about the campaign , another undertaking that troubled her wary husband . Soon she was questioning colleagues about the propriety of telling certain sensitive anecdotes . The demands of the book only added to Kitty 's numerous pressures . Finally , she lost control .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
