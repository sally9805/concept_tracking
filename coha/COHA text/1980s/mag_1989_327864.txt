Criminal trials used to have four main components : defendant , attorneys , judge and jury . Now they have a fifth : writers , eager to make a killing of their own . The more notorious the case nowadays , the longer seems the line of authors in and around the courtroom , armed with notebooks and contracts . Last year 's " preppie murder " trial of Robert Chambers for strangling Jennifer Levin in New York City 's Central Park , for example , will soon yield Wasted , a book by Linda Wolfe ( The Professor and the Prostitute ) . The Tawana Brawley affair has inspired a team of six New York Times reporters and an editor to collaborate on a volume projected for release in late 1989 . Politics and sex were the surefire ingredients of the fraud , bribery and conspiracy trial of former Miss America Bess Myerson , and , sure enough , they are soon to be clothbound in a book by Shana Alexander , whose previous titles chronicled the murders of a diet doctor and a Utah millionaire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dwarfs them all . The Manhattan lawyer was accused of brutalizing his lover Hedda Nussbaum and was convicted of manslaughter in the death of their illegally adopted daughter Lisa . Here was every ingredient of the true-crime blockbuster : cocaine , an S-M relationship , a beautiful six-year-old and a battered woman , all set against the background of Greenwich Village . Most important , in a city afflicted with racial malaise , it starred what Tom Wolfe identified in The Bonfire of the Vanities as the Great White Defendant . <P> From the trial 's opening statements , aspiring authors jockeyed for space on courtroom benches . Joyce Johnson , a contributing editor for Vanity Fair , began work on What Lisa Knew . Free-lance writer Maury Terry launched into The Dark Side of 10th Street . Sam Erlich , a fellow free lance , undertook Lisa , Hedda , Joel . Marie Winn , author of a television critique , The Plug-In Drug , jotted notes for an untitled book of her own . <P> Winner of the race to print is Susan Brownmiller , whose novel Waverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was completed long before the verdict came in . In this fictive version of events leading to Lisa 's death , Nussbaum ( thinly masked as Judith Winograd ) is programmed for catastrophe . Her childhood begins with abuse : " Whack . Where were you ? Whack . Ma , I got lost . Whack . I told you . . . always to come straight home . Whack . " <P> Once she moves in with Barry Kantor ( Steinberg ) , himself a victim of childhood beatings , sadomasochism reigns supreme : " He did n't mean to bang my head against the wall . . . This is a man who cares so deeply , who feels so much pain . " <P> Brownmiller attempts a novelist 's overview , tracing the domestic tyrannies that slowly escalate to mutilation and death . But her squabbling adults have little more personality than Punch and Judy , and their maltreated daughter is a mere shadow . Waverly Place takes 294 pages to express what W.H. Auden did in a quatrain : " I and the public know/ What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done/ Do evil in return . "
