Mondale 's campaign : A glass train or an unstoppable iron horse ? <P> It has been a cake-walk-so far . He has raised almost twice as much money as his nearest competitor . The AFL-CIO , the United Auto Workers , the National Education Association and the National Organization for Women all support him . So do Tip O'Neill , Robert Strauss , perhaps 100 members of the House , New York Governor Mario Cuomo , Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis , San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein , Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley , Detroit Mayor Coleman Young . Concedes a top strategist : " The worst Pollyanna in our bunch would n't have been able to predict last December that we would be in this position now . " <P> But one question remains , and it is the most important one of all : When the voting starts , will people line up behind Walter Mondale ? Despite the gathering momentum of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination , skeptics note that Mondale has not aroused the electorate , that his support , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch thick . " Another doubter likens Mondale 's campaign to a glass train : one bump , and it is sure to shatter . <P> After long months of polishing and revving up , the Mondale locomotive is poised for its first tests , in the Iowa caucuses next week and the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 28 . Mondale , 56 , will be running against seven other Democrats and the high expectations generated by his picture-perfect campaign . " A win 's a win , " argues acting Campaign Chairman James Johnson , who rightly scoffs at the claim of rivals that Mondale must get 60% of the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire or be seen as slipping . Still , anything less than a 10% margin of victory over the runner-up in New Hampshire-and at least 40% of the vote in Iowa-might be interpreted by the press as a defeat , and this has filled Mondale staffers with gloomy imaginings . What if Jesse Jackson surprises in New Hampshire and siphons votes from their man ? What if Mondale supporters stay home , assuming their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register their protest at the notion that they are being run over by a Mondale machine before they can even be heard ? <P> All of the fretting is prudent in the unpredictable arena of primary politics , but it is probably unwarranted . A new nationwide poll of Democrats and independents taken for TIME by Yankelovich , Skelly &; White , Inc. shows that Mondale is still on a roll . Last December his lead over John Glenn was 34% to 18% ; now it has jumped to 50% to 18% , a leap of 16 percentage points . Worse yet for Glenn and the other candidates is that the undecided vote has fallen from 26% to 14% in that period , with most of those who made up their minds apparently choosing Mondale . Perhaps wishfully , the other campaigners had considered the uncertain voters as likely to be anti-Mondale . Jackson is a distant third at 6% . <P> Mondale holds commanding leads in Iowa and New Hampshire as Democrats in those states prepare to make their choices . A mid-January poll by the Des Moines Register gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George McGovern tied for third place at 6% . A Boston Globe survey late last month shows Mondale ahead of Glenn , 42% to 19% , in New Hampshire . Jackson is next with 10% , ahead of Gary Hart 's 8%.
