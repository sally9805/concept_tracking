Analyze the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations , using the mass media for data . A good running account can be found in Newsweek Magazine issues from November 28 , 1977 through the entire following year and beyond . Pick only a few of these articles for simplicity of the analysis while you practice . In other words , choose your frame of analysis , the segment , or unit , or moment in time you wish to study . When you add frames together , analyzing each in turn , you really have a moving picture , or moving film ? a " running account " of human events . This running account is really accident . A movie film is composed of thousands of single , stoppedaction photographs or frames . When put together and run rapidly , there is the perception of motion . Human life is composed of an uncountable number of single-frame actions . These single frames can be analyzed . When frames are put together we have the ongoing show of life . More about life as a show or drama and frame analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for your practice exercise here , simply choose a segment or frame , make an analysis , and then add other frames . A few sentences of a description of one small frame of action of the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations will be analyzed here to help illustrate the richness of the exchange perspective .  | The Egyptian President was particularly furious with Prime Minister Begin for brushing aside his suggestion . . . that the Sinai town of El Arish be returned to Egypt as a goodwill gesture and for insisting that Israel would not give away " one grain of sand " for nothing . " The man says that no government gives away something for nothing ? after I took my historic trip to Jerusalem ! " an angry Sadat told special U.S. envoy Alfred Atherton . " Really , that was insulting . " ' I will make some presumptions about what Begin and Sadat were thinking while making the statements above . In more detailed research it would be necessary to ask the participants deeper questions . The responses are recorded and are then analyzed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exchanges will be emphasized by italicizing the appropriate words . The participants are using exchange terminology even though both likely do not know that there is such a sociological analytical perspective . Israel will not give away one grain of sand unless it gets back something in return . Sadat is angry . Something for nothing ? I ( Sadat ) made a goodwill gesture by my visit . Why should n't Israel give something in return ? I risked my presidential office ( the risk is perceived as a give ) , the goodwill of my Arab colleagues ( powerful participants with a large stake in the exchanges ) in other nations , and the wrath of the Palestine Liberation Organization by giving my historic visit to Israel . I gave by shaking hands with my enemies , kissing the cheeks of leaders responsible for thousands of deaths of my people . What does Israel give back ? Not a grain of sand for nothing ? All this is nothing ? However , Begin 's perception may be that Sadat takes a trip and shakes our hands and expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange . A town is expected for a kiss , territory for a visit , a treaty for a handshake . Begin is angry . Sadat is insulted . Sadat is perceived to demand something for nothing . Begin is perceived to give nothing in return for something , the trip . The perceived insults and perceived imbalances become part of the exchanges , complicating the main issues . Continue with the analysis of other aspects of the negotiations on your own . Refer now to many other frames of the negotiations . What did Sadat attempt when he broke the old war mentality exchanges and visited Israel ? What did he gain ? What did he lose ? What did he want to get ? Why did n't the Israelis give Sadat all that he wanted ? What is the effect on Sadat ? Note his exchanges with the factions of his people , his government , within the entire Arab  | world , and with the United States , and with Israel . Note how he tries to keep them in balance . Note why he needs to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the Arab dissident factions who can give support which is helpful for maintaining his power base , and helpful for a lasting peace . Note why the Israelis are unwilling , even unable by their perceptions , to give . What do the Israelis want to give ? What do they need to get ? Note the use and management of symbols and negotiations . Note the importance placed on symbols ( music , flags , protocol ) on the first Sadat visit to Israel . These symbols have to do with " face " giving and saving and giving and taking signs of respect . Each in the giving tries to avoid an affront to the other , but each does not want to give too much , even in symbolic terms . Both sides are aware of the delicate balance of the new relationship . Each strives mightily to avoid offense , struggling to build some sort of acceptable exchange system in the correct currency . Yet the negotiations keep breaking down anyway . Why ? Avoid taking sides , but analyze exchanges . You will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolic interactionism and the exchange perspective in analyses of case materials and see how both integrate in the understanding of human behavior . In your own work you might wish to first separate the two perspectives , then later put them together , for practice . The more perspectives you can use in analysis , the more dimensions of the multidimensional real world of human relationships you will understand . Presented now is a brief analysis of a mother-daughter problem . Follow the exchange threads . Build the network of exchange grooves in your mind . Follow the analysis of exchanges presented . Add the symbolic interactionist perspective to this analysis . Add other exchange insights by applying the varied exchange questions ( above ) to the case . I am adding points of analysis to the case . But in normal social interaction you would have as your data only the mother-daughter responses . This is the description . It is your job to analyze from that description . In the case that follows , note the depth the exchange perspective brings to those few interactions presented . Note the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the foreground . Most people get caught up in exchange processes , but do not really know what is happening , although they can feel the effects . But when we analyze we can see causes and  | effects . If we do not like the effects we can change variables to eliminate the causes . Note the many insights that can be provided to participants in exchanges by fleshing out the exchanges with analysis . A mother and daughter have a history of negative patterned interactions , an exchange of shout for shout , bad feeling for bad feeling , distrust for distrust . One evening the mother asks where her daughter is going and is told by the daughter that it is none of the mother 's business . Usually the mother would get even with her daughter by paying her back , in exchange , with a series of negatives of her own . This usually escalates into a wild scene full of accusations and finally a tearful mother trying to pay her daughter for the trouble by making her feel guilty . But this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escalating negative payment for payment . She gives an unexpected response , saying , " You 're right . It 's not my business at all . Have a lovely evening . " This behavior is not in line with the daughter 's expectation . She expected a response that would take them both down the track of an argument , in the same old direction of so many of their other interactive trips . Now the track is switched and she is lost . She backs up , enters the old , familiar track , and sets off again down the line for the accustomed argument . It was the network she was used to living . She tries to retrieve the familiar pattern by stepping up her aggression . ( Note that she is less interested in arguing than in giving what is now a natural exchange response , patterned into her self by hundreds of repetitions . ) The daughter still thinks she can predict her mother 's responses . It is important to her that she receive the expected responses because she already has learned how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself that she can still control her mother 's responses . The daughter says , " You 're damned right . You can just lay off me for a change . I 'm sick of living under a dictatorship ! " Ordinarily , this response would have increased the negative for negative exchanges , leading to increased mutual bitterness . But the mother is set on restructuring the exchanges . She pushes her daughter down the track to the switched exchange , and sets her off on the new track again . She does not say " You ingrate , " expected by the daughter , but she says " I 've been wrong , trying to run your life for you . I hope you enjoy yourself tonight . " The mother is careful to give positive nonverbal cues to match  | her positive verbal statement . If the new sentences were said with sarcasm or martyrdom , symbols would be perceived negatively , and they would be down the old track again . There is a long silence . Daughter then blurts out , " I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by midnight . " Mothers usually do not restructure this way because they get too much satisfaction from replaying the old , familiar grooved-in record , week after week . They perceive benefits from familiarity . They receive benefits from the vivid contact they make with their children during these harsh confrontations . The vivid contact is of the close interpersonal relations in the negative matrix . But there are negative payments too . These payments are escalating bad feelings , deteriorating family relationships , loss of ability to discuss real issues deeply and fully , and loss of the possibility of resolving problems . Love for love , trust for trust , respect for respect , depth dialogue for depth dialogue , emotional closeness for emotional closeness are better ? positive ? parent-child networks in which to achieve vivid contact . ' Can you see why throwing blame on each other in human interactions , for example in this case by mother and daughter , is wasted energy , energy that is a negative confounding the desire for positive exchanges , exchanges of trust for trust , respect for respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how exchanges can be restructured so participants become partners on the basis of what they really want to give and get from the relation-ship ? There are benefits to the restructuring process . But there are also risks . Each person must take responsibility for the risks in his own life actions . If symbols are not fully communicated , or if the other does not understand them or chooses to misunderstand them , the result could be far out of line of what was expected in restructured exchanges . In cases such as the one of the mother and daughter above , the daughter might have interpreted her mother 's positive exchange give of trust and respect as " Mother does n't care and says I can do anything , " and do it , and get into trouble , instead of , " Mother is a fair person gives equity who trusts me gives trust . I am being trusted , and will be trustworthy . " Thus , each exchange partner must know the other , what works and what does not , and what language must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks in acting or in not acting , the risks in  | maintaining old exchanges or involved in setting new ones must be considered . Then we hope things work out well . The most highly trained surgeons sometimes predict the final results of their work poorly . They learn from their mistakes . There are risks to surgery that the patient must share , and there are risks to not having surgery that the patient must share too . It is the same with the social world . People are complex creatures and are not always predictable . All they need to do is hear or interpret a symbol other than you wished it . The exchange result can be far out of line from your intent . This is one reason why mistakes are common and interpersonal conflict frequent . It is necessary for people to forgive themselves and others and try again . Keep making exchanges . This makes a viable , vibrant , but not always perfect life .  | THE CONFLICT PERSPECTIVE in sociology perceives that conflict is a normal part of social exchange processes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as ongoing sets of struggles . Contrary to popular belief conflict is perceived as often necessary and functional for good human and social relations . Conflict can serve useful and humane social purposes . It can aid group and interpersonal functioning . Conflict can be functional because it gives the exchange participants a chance to air their true feelings . It gives the participants a chance to negotiate to meet their needs . The relationship moves to a higher level , rid of underlying annoyances which the partners formerly kept under cover while hoping to keep the peace . It forces partners to the exchange to rethink positions and to change their behavior . In the heat of conflict the participants find it hard to avoid the need to confront issues and one another . If they listen carefully and communicate well they may find the root symbols , issues , problems , behavior that have been poisoning the relationship . In open conflict even implied threats of punishment , leading to fear of withdrawal of services ( such as in a strike ) , fear of possible loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible permanent break of the exchanges , press the participants into negotiating and exchanging in gives and takes . The aim is to improve the relationship to avoid the possibility of these perceived losses . Through conflict there is often social and personal change . For example , a good , open argument may be functional in forcing a dominant in a relationship to change behavior . An employer seems  | to " hold all the cards . " In sociological conflict terminology he has the resources and thus he has power over people who want and need the resources . If they want the resources they have to meet the exchange take desired by the person with power . The employer uses his power . He sets exchanges in which he is dominant and workers subordinate . If the workers engage in open conflict they may force a strike that disrupts his business , production , sales , flow of income , and thus decreases his resources , and his power . This may force him into changed behavior more satisfying to the workers in order to keep his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lost wages . In this way they can show their willingness to pay in order to hopefully gain by staying away from work on a strike . They can refuse to reenter old exchange relationships even on threat of punishment as the employer response . The employer is then in a less powerful position and is no longer dominant . The workers have resources , such as their work , which the employer needs and wants . The workers thus have power over the employer . In the power struggle of a strike , which is a labor-management conflict , the employer pits his resources , and power over wages , against the workers ' power deriving from resources of control over their productive work . In the gives and takes forced by the conflict a new agreement may be reached on mutual control and use of resources and power . A new peace is attained . Exchange relations require balances of power . Conflict sets new balances and helps keep the peace . An employer or any other dominant can gain and use power only if others are willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept orders and are willing to accept any payment for it , the powerful no longer has power . Power relations ( as in any other relationship ) are exchange relationships . Power can only be seen in relation to something else . Power is part of the pushes and pulls of exchange relationships . A person can be powerful in a group only in relation to and in exchange with other people there . A powerful person can give orders and take subservience only insofar as the perceived powerless partner is willing to give obedience and take orders . When the subordinate refuses to " take it " anymore and refuses to give allegiance , or to follow orders , then there is no longer the same power relation . The subordinate cracks the old exchange web . The other participant is free to let it crack ( the relationship is broken ) or must groove new exchange networks in line with demands made on him . p 89 A woman who is tired of male dominance ( as perceived ) refuses to " take it . " In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand a change from the man in her love relationship , or to break the relation if he does not change , or to risk that he will break it . Workers have the power to lose wages and to risk losing their jobs . When they use this power , in a strike , the employer no longer has the power to make demands upon them . Conflict often comes from the desire of participants to redistribute power in exchange relations . Power within relationships is not a stable thing . It shifts from one person to the other , from issue to issue , often momentarily , as in a close interaction where there is an underlying dispute . There are also shifts in power in long-term relations . For example , the power of minority peoples in America has increased over the long term to a position of greater equality of power with other societal groups . A husband and wife may have similar long-term shifts of power . They also shift every few moments in the normal push/pull of daily exchanges . Such movements in social relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balances of power are part of what makes the moving equilibrium of exchange relationships . Conflict often results when participants act to change established and accustomed balances of power . When there are desires for shifts in balances of power conflict tends to rise until a new , perceived , acceptable ( to participants ) balance is created . A perception of equity may come into being through negotiated exchanges . Or the newly powerful may establish , by psychological or social force , his rights and power so the less powerful " fall in line , " even though they perceive inequities . The perceived inequities will lead to tendencies toward many forms of overt and covert conflict until still new balances are made . Balances of power can clearly be seen in international relations , as with the United States and Russia . The moving equilibrium of U.S.-Russian relations is very complex and multifactored . The moving equilibrium includes : near conflict , possible conflict , shifting allies , increased military might , shifts of the military from one area of the world to another , meddling in internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diplomatic maneuvers , and wars by proxy in far areas of the globe . The United States makes exchanges with China , and the Russians perceive a shift of the balances of world power and are frightened into simultaneous moves toward  | gives and takes with the United States and other nations , to which the United States , China , and other nations react . Such is the constantly moving balance of power , in relative equilibrium , in the moving equilibrium of international affairs . Clinically , we may suggest less competitive , less fearful and awesome military balances and more open , newer balances of power in the moving equilibrium of international affairs . For analytical purposes , whether international politics improve toward humanitarian aims and results or not , balances of power can be seen to create a level of peace and some level of relative stability between nations . A war can break out at any moment between them . This can also be analyzed in terms of balances of power and the equilibrium that is possible as a result of the shifts through victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social system where equilibrium moves toward disequilibrium , and toward equilibrium again , maintaining a moving equilibrium in the long run . A husband and wife may seem to be relatively conflict-free . They have established a balance of power acceptable to them . The wife gets a job . She is now away from her full-time duties at home and no longer can or wishes to do the same work there . The husband maintains his old expectations about his wife 's household work . She has money that she earns and brings to the family . She has the power of economic self-support and no longer has to depend on her husband for her economic needs . She thus increases her latent power because she is an economic equal at home and can even break the relationship without fear of economic consequences . This might not be discussed but it may be very clear to both husband and wife . The balance of power has shifted . The partners will tend to engage in conflict about housekeeping duties and other issues based on their changed relationship . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on different behavior and exchanges , and based on changed expectations . When conflict arises such participants should use it as a symptom of the need for setting new balances of power . They should not blame one another for the conflict . They should welcome and look into the conflict to see what it is telling them about their relationship . When they find out what it is telling them they should then set new exchanges and new balances of power . They will then live peacefully until new problems arise to be settled . Mother comes to visit the family . In a moment there are shifts  | in the old balance of power because mother sides with son or with daughter-in-law . It is not the mere visit of mother that makes such a visit so difficult so often , but gross shifts within the equilibrium of the husband-wife relation that occur as soon as she steps into the house . It is not necessarily the " nastiness " of a mother-in-law for a married couple , or behavior of a lover in a love relationship that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conflict processes involved with many balances , including balances of power . Wise people do not symbol other people as " faulty , " but work on the social processes necessary among people for good growth relationships . Few people understand this . The result is a great deal of wasted energy and interpersonal misery . There is great clinical potential for improved social relationships in the understanding that exchanges , different symbols and needs , balances of power , and conflict are built-in features of social relationships . These features must be well-managed for successful social relationships . Good social relationships require a great deal of time and work to manage the moving equilibrium . Too many people mistakenly think that love and good feelings ( and nothing else ) are required for good social relationships , especially so in dating and marriage . Effort and the skill of managing conflict and arranging appropriate balances in the moving equilibrium are also necessary . Without this effort and skill love is lost as the partners get caught up in processes they can not handle and do not understand . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship loses relation and they " split , " falling out of love . The conflict perspective perceives different needs and perceptions and struggles over them , balances of power , the losing and building of power , the supporting of relationships through conflict , and breakups of relationships ? among other processes ? as the heart of all human behavior which is then studied in all areas of life . Even when a woman and man develop a relationship , there are power relations , struggles , and tendencies toward bonding and dissolution , among other conflict processes . It is the same in every other social relationship . Conflict may be seen as the salt and pepper of life ; it is the spice of life and of all relations . Love and peace are the sugar , " the milk and honey " of life . A skillful cook balances the bitter and sweet , the sweet and sour , all of which become part of the same tasty brew . We  | put sugar and lemon in our tea . It would seem that one cancels the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not just drink plain tea ? But what seem to be the opposites of sugar and lemon do not cancel one another . Instead , each draws forth the flavor potential of the tea . The ingredient-of conflict appropriately used adds to life in the same manner . The blandness of nonconflicting relations is like vanilla ; conflict is the hot pepper , which in a balance with the bland , creates a tasty , mouth-watering , sometimes tongueburning life brew . Hot pepper conflict brings tears to the eyes . The management of conflict is an art that gives spice to life , providing growing ? not stagnating ? human relationships . This is the perspective of conflict theorists , who study and analyze the dimension of conflict in life . Without open conflict partners to an exchange may continue to provide perceived unbalanced exchanges to one another . These may be punished openly or in passive forms of aggression ( really silent conflict ) , such as repeated , annoying latenesses , forgotten appointments , rude yawns , poor motivation , willful mistakes , and sicknesses psychosomatically induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exchange partner . This leads the partner to reciprocate . What looks like a peaceful , nonargumentative environment really may be full of slow-acting poison ? a poison of aggressive behavior covered by the cloak of passivity . A couple may have built-up antagonisms on the issue of how public or private their relationship should be , for example how much social activity they should engage in with others as contrasted to how much private time they should have together . More public time means less private time together . If this issue is not fought over and resolved openly , antagonisms will lie buried in the partners and in the relationship . A partner seething with repressed antagonism may avoid the precipitating issue , playing the role of " nice person who does not fight . " But she still seethes . Her anger finds an outlet but is deflected from the issue bothering her onto something else ? for example , headaches , stomachaches , and bad moods whenever it is party time . " I 'm too sick to enjoy myself at the party " leads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the party . This partner may punish for this passively ( passive aggression ) by being sexually cold at the private times they are together . The one who likes social activities has a bad time there because of the passive aggressions of the partner . The one who likes private times has  | a bad time there because of the passive aggressions of the other . Each passively punishes the other for the bad times . If the give of punishment is for the take of passive aggressions , then the true cause of the conflict lies buried and can not be resolved . The partners begin to fight about spoiled parties , latenesses , sicknesses , and sexual coldness . These become issues without resolution because even resolving these issues ( which often are not resolved either ) are just treatments of symptoms of other issues that lie as germs causing deteriorating social health . Thinking that an ill person has a cold when pneumonia is the problem ? and taking aspirin to reduce the fever ? will not cure the problem of the bacterial infection . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict . Conflict is not to blame . Not conflicting over the real issues to bring forward real causes is to blame . Not negotiating real cures to conflict by gives and takes is to blame . Some forms of conflict , as with passive aggressions , or violence , lead to a great deal of misery , and ruin life relations . It is a matter of destructive poison that is added to relationships , not some spice in reasonable amounts to create a tasty brew . But conflict , such as an open argument confronting mutually understood issues , leading to negotiation of a new moving equilibrium , can be very functional for good life relations . No poison accumulates here . Conflict is a very unstable ingredient . Only conflict of a certain type and measure helps relationships . The same ingredient inappropriately used ruins the relationship . I ruined a good stew and nearly my health by putting a dozen small whole hot peppers into the pot . One quarter of one pepper would have made the good meal I wished . Many people engaging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which cover real issues . They begin to fight over latenesses , sex , dinner , even politics . They may really be fighting over the meaning , type , and need for expressions of love . Sometimes many hours of professional counselling will finally uncover the real issues under the series of futile arguments covering the real problem . When the real issues are brought to the foreground , negotiations can be engaged in , and many times very simply so . The partners leave the counsellor 's office in love again . They were always in love . The love was hidden by persistent " off the issue " conflict , too often passively engaged in at that . The partners did not even realize that they were in conflict ,  | although the passive latenesses , cold sex , and the like were frustrating and punishing . Do you really know what you are fighting about when in conflict ? Do you even know that you are fighting ? Do you really engage in open conflict or do you bury issues and punish passively or for reasons your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional , open , real issue , negotiated conflict for better life relationships . The Christian ideal of " turn the other cheek " has been misinterpreted by many people as an injunction to avoid conflict . Such people may indeed avoid conflict but they also tend toward frowns , hateful eyes , tense faces , and tight mouths . Observe these people and perceive how " up tight " they are . They are tight ? tightly holding their anger . A person who engages in conflict and resolves it , buries it not by sweeping it under the rug ? unseen ? so the house is really dirty forever . He picks it up , handles it , and throws it in the garbage , out of the house ? where it belongs . Then he washes his hands and is clean of the conflict . This person is not " up tight " and can afford to be happy , content , peaceful , and loving . The person who carries the garbage with him in a sack on his shoulders forever and lives with it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions that he is a " burdened " and " burdensome " person ? " up tight . " It is worse yet when he does not admit to carrying the sack . Carefully observe people 's faces and " body language . " Note the many who are " up tight . " They may need to learn to engage in functional conflict . They must empty their garbage sacks . Having symboled their anger , they should pick up the garbage and throw it out of the house , " clearing the air " by resolving the problem in balanced gives and takes . Actually such conflict resolution channels new exchange grooves into social relationships , allowing the partners to get out of old exchange tracks which led them persistently to bad trips . Grooving new exchange tracks through creative conflict gets people out of their old rut of unresolved conflict . If someone insults you , turn the other cheek and repay with love . The refusal to engage in the reciprocation ( exchange ) of the evil ? punishment for punishment ? breaks the sickness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate with love " is a good exchange principle built into religious teaching . A bully is often after a personal " rise " in seeing reactions to his bullying . Those who do not provide it , and who do not engage in the  | expected negative reactions , do not fall into his trap . He no longer finds pleasure in bullying and has to look elsewhere for ways to bolster his shallow sense of nonloving self . A masochist bothers people because he wants the pain when he is hit in return . Those who turn the other cheek do not fall victim to his sickness , which needs negative reactions to flourish . But a masochist who persists in annoying someone in the hope of eliciting a negative reaction may well be told , lovingly but strongly , to change his ways , and to seek counselling if he can not otherwise change , or else the exchange relation will be broken . A person can give in forgiveness many times , but the person giving negatives must at some point change behavior to positive or suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be repaid with love many times , in the hope that he will not find profit in seeing the victim 's pain and anger and thus will stop his bullying . But if he persists in bullying it may be wise to break the exchange relation . He will have to pay the penalty of loneliness . He can benefit by learning to make changes in his behavior to avoid broken relationships . Another way to break the bullying exchange after many repayments of love without effect is to abruptly smash back . It is dangerous advice and can often backfire . But it frequently succeeds . When I was a little child a bully twice my size would not let me pass on the street . When I went to the left he did . When I went to the right he did . I asked him peacefully ( turning the other cheek ) to let me pass . He laughed and blocked my way . I smashed a cast-iron pull toy I had been pulling straight into his head . He was taken to the hospital for stitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me again . I doubt if he ever bullied anyone again . He learned that there are consequences to pay for being a bully . But I learned that the consequences of being a victim of a bully can be less frightening than the consequences of drawing blood in physical violence . ( Actually I was more disturbed at the wrath of my mother at my actions than having injured the bully . ) This was a major early trauma of my life . It was not pleasant living with the result of my swift action . I tried to avoid any form of conflict for many years , straight through portions of my adulthood , after that frightening experience when I became aware of my powers . That did me no good either and drew many bullies on the attack on the city streets and in work organizations . I learned to use words as a mechanism of conflict . Thus far I have kept out of violent mischief .  | If a friend starts to shout in an open conflict , turn the other cheek and repay the hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be angry , and love him , even in his negative condition . But openly confront the issues that are making him shout . If you do not know what they are , find-out . Do not mistake " turn the other cheek " to mean , " I will not react to his shout . I will pretend it did not happen . I will thus keep the peace . " Note that turn the other cheek says " turn to the other side of the face , " not " bury your head in the ground . " In other words , switch from a hateful response by the turn , keeping the other cheek of love in the exchange . Then work out the conflict so the exchanges in truth , not in imagination , can be peaceful . Keeping the peace by avoiding issues and conflict is dysfunctional for good human relationships . It is functional for good human relationships to engage in open , fair conflict on issues , with negotiation for the purpose of restructured relationships where participants can be satisfied . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with students . A wife would be well advised not to negotiate a husband 's desire to give her a beating as part of his supposed marital rights . She could suggest a mutual fight with foam rubber bats ( used in varied forms of marital therapy ) to relieve normal built-up aggressions which arise between intimates , but past this point she accepts no negotiation . Social relationships may be quiet and may thus look peaceful , but the conflict perspective could clearly show the real conflict potentially or actually there in any case . The conflict perspective indicates that conflict and its seeds are everywhere . It is the work of an observer and analyst of this persuasion to search for ? to research ? conflict in all human relations . A relationship may be peaceful only because participants do not have enough trust in one another to risk the consequences of conflict over what is bothering them . The conflict is only buried under overtly pleasant behavior . If we knew we could get away with it without punishment , we would engage in conflict with many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But sometimes they let things " go by . " Participants in these overtly peaceful relations pay by never getting feedback about their behavior which may be detracting from good human relationships . Just because conflict is absent does not mean the relationship is strong and stable . It may mean that it is too weak for the participants to  | risk conflict . Partners in a good , stable marriage ? where husband and wife know they love one another and know they will stay together ? can have a terrible open conflict because they are not afraid to do so . They bring their relationship to a higher level by settling problems this way . The conflict is functional when it brings the participants to higher plateaus of peace . A person who is afraid his partner will leave him may avoid conflict for fear of pushing the partner away . The roots of the conflict remain there anyway , whether expressed or not . The conflict approach perceives that whether people prefer to see it or not , where there is life there is struggle . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a struggle for dominance , even against bacteria . But the functional nature of conflict ? even with bacteria ? is that it brings underlying causes , and then hopefully cures , into the open . Feeling sick because bacteria are now dominant , we may engage in open conflict with them with medication and then hopefully learn lessons to avoid conditions of sickness again . It is the same with human social relationships . Open , honest conflict relieves tensions within a person and between people . My health is always the better when I tell people how and why it is that I disagree with them . When I do not do this I suffer headaches , nervousness , and other forms of ill-health . When I engage in vigorous , open conflict on honest , not deflected issues , I find that people often like me . They respect me for my honesty , openness , vigor , and for saying what I mean , need , and feel . It has been said that couples who do not engage in open conflict have greater tendencies toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight on the issues by vigorously exchanging symbols in interaction . The marriage case in the Appendix shows what happens when couples do not conflict openly . There is stagnation and no individual or mutual growth . Covering conflict may further destabilize an already unstable relationship . " Janice and I have never had an all-out quarrel or even a meaningful argument , and several years ago I awoke to the fact I was bored out of my skull with her , with myself , with our lifestyle . . . . " He sat motionless at the counselor 's desk , conveying a surface impression of invulnerable control that was belied by tightly clenched fists that lay in his lap . ' Through counselling this couple learned to engage in open conflict . Their marriage improved . I would hypothesize that their  | physical health did too . I would also hypothesize that there was a change of usual posture from tightly clenched fists to an " openhanded " body language . Conflict is a form of interaction . Blocking one 's mind as if the annoying people are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreases interactions , decreases exchanges of symbols , and weakens the exchange network . Pretending that elements of conflict are not built into a relationship when they are there adds elements of phoniness to the relationship . This phoniness becomes part of the network of exchanges , thus poisoning the relationship . In open conflict people can not easily avoid one another . The symbols and interactions are too sharp and too loud to avoid . Hence even some " dead " marriages " liven up " during a conflict . It is also for this reason that some people may interact mainly in a conflictual manner . This is as true of business or other work relations as it is of international relations , domestic politics , urban gangs , or the family . It is the only way such people make sharp , exciting contact with others . At some point they fall into an exchange rut where only conflict brings life to their relationships and to their daily existence . Otherwise , they live in a deathlike trance , " bored to death . " Such people need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-disclosure of positive feelings as well as negative , can bring life to relationships . These people do not know that milk and honey are pleasant tasting and are good for the health . They ruin their stomachs by eating only highly spiced foods . They do not understand that pepper is good if used appropriately , and if it is balanced by the bland . They do not know that conflict is good in appropriate measure , balanced by love and peace . Some people are so accustomed to the exchange rut of unresolved conflict that they are frightened by the emptiness they perceive in peace . They find and maintain leaders and policies that lead them down the track of unresolved conflict , which excites dull lives and empty people . It would be better if such people conflicted and resolved issues that are really bothering them rather than looking for enemies to excite and incite so life can have some spice , and so repressed antagonisms can find an outlet . Conflict is functional , but only if balanced by the tender virtues of love , understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only know how to relate through conflict are in an exchange rut . These people , in fact , have a stake in not resolving the conflict . Without  | conflict they would not know what to do , how to live , how to interact , or how to get excitement from others and from life . Nonabusive conflict that is engaged in for the purpose of achieving a real peace is functional , and it brings spice to life while in the conflict , and then when out of it . Those who engage in persistent conflict to spice otherwise dull lives make , have , and maintain sick relationships . Electricity has no charge without the interaction of negatives and positives . Magnetism has no field of action without positive and negative poles . The field of human action and interaction also is charged by positives and negatives . Peaceful and loving relationships are the positive poles . Conflicting relations may be seen as the negative poles . Where there is only a positive in electricity , magnetism , and social relations , there is no action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is only negative in electricity , magnetism , and social relations . Without the balance of positive to negative and the tensions between them , there is a broken circuit and no action . When conflict ( - ) is tempered and made functional by love ( + ) , and where love ( + ) is cleansed and excited by conflict ( - ) , then there is + /- , a charge , energy , and attraction ? a field of action , electricity , and magnetism in the relationship . There is no way out of the need to exchange to maintain social relationships , for social relationships are exchanges . Part of the exchange process involves sharing perceptions , needs , feelings , engaging in gives and takes , trade-offs , and often decision-makingall of which make potentials for conflict . Exchanges set up reciprocal patterns of interaction , which include build-ups and resolutions of imbalances ? processes that tend to generate conflict . If the issues can be openly negotiated and resolved , then there is growth in the relationship . Many couples think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love is real to much of the population , and it has effects , but it does not match the facts of life . This misperception of the symbol love causes unnecessary loss of love . People who love one another care for one another . They are close to one another . Therefore , they watch over one another . When the many naturally different perceptions and symbols , for example of good , healthy , fair , or unfair intrude because of care and closeness of people of different types ( such as simply men and women ) , some people hide the resultant conflict for fear of improper or dwindling love . Wise couples air differences in periodic conflicts , learn about one another , rethink behavior , make changes , restructure exchanges , and maintain love .  | So good is conflict for airing repressed feelings so people are rid of that " garbage " pestering their selves , so good is it in stimulating hormone and blood flow ( note the red faces of participants to open face-to-face conflict , symbolizing the real rush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in stimulating body heat ( people in open conflict are said to be " in the heat of battle , " and " heated , " in a " heated argument " ) , that many people find that they become immediately sexually aroused and have the most stimulating sex after a resolved argument . This happens mainly when the real issues have been resolved so the poison does not intrude into the sex . An open shouting match sometimes cures a man of temporary impotence . It is not possible to long love and to be aroused by someone against whom one carries hundreds of unexpressed hurts , grudges and grievances . It is said that some element of tension between a couple leads to good sex . This is because such a couple shows that they are in a relation ? a relationship ? with one another . A real relationship has negatives as well as positives which make the field of action . The real relationship where a person cares about and thus is sometimes annoyed at the other shows a real , strong field of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is a matter of balance in a moving equilibrium . Some tension and conflict peppers sex to an exciting dish ; too much ruins it . Conflict is functional , but under certain conditions . It needs to be balanced by positive feelings and actions . It needs to move toward resolution . And the real issues of conflict must be determined , managed , and negotiated . People need training in how to provide functional conflict in the family , at work , in politics , and elsewhere . Violence is a type of conflict . But when saying that conflict is functional , I do not mean that conflict in the form of violence is functional for humane living and good life relationships . It is not suggested that physical abuse , such as wife beating , child abuse , or police brutality are good . It is not suggested that psychological abuse , such as hurtful name calling , is good . I am not speaking of abuse as functional conflict , but of open , fair , respectful conflict on real issues . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in death and destruction in this exchange are heavy . War may be functional in finishing a conflict , but with what dysfunctions ( other costs ) in balance ? Are there other ways we could perceive to settle conflict more functionally ( with less cost ) by resolving differences in other forms of gives and takes ?  | The conference table is less destructive than the battlefield . A sharp , nonabusive verbal exchange is more functional and humane than wife beating . Conflict of the symbolic type , not for abuse , but to raise negative feelings to the foreground , to explain one 's position , meanings , needs , feelings , perceptions , to demand fair treatment and more balanced exchanges , to save a relationship , and even in a shout of temper to get rid of bad feelings , is good . But these must keep to , or rapidly get to the issues to create clearer lines of communication and deeper understanding . This will lead to negotiation of more satisfying ways of life , which should relieve the grievances of the participants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizational relationships , as it is in friendship and marriage . War and other forms of aggressive abuse tend to lead to more and more aggression and abuse . The participants hurt tend to " pay back " equally . This encourages the aggression of the first aggressor who does not like to be hurt . This aggressor has now found a reason to be hostile and aggressive . This is an escalating series of bitter exchanges . A person or group harming another justifies their actions on the grounds that the victim deserved it . People like to think of themselves as good , kind , charitable , fair and just . Having hurt someone and without knowledge or strength to ask forgiveness as a balance , the aggressor tends to hate the victim , displacing or projecting his self-hate in his own eyes , for not being kind and just , onto the victim . The mere sight of the victim puts such a person to a rage . It is himself he sees there . He sees the results of his unkind behavior . The victim reminds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who is not kind , forgiving , charitable , and who is capable of giving someone great pain . A victim is often known to be capable of forgiving an aggressor faster than the aggressor can forgive the victim . The aggressor must forgive the victim for being there , for not defending herself , and for reminding him how mean he ? the aggressor ? can be . The victim who has not internalized the aggressive act into self-degradation must forgive only the aggressor . The aggressor must forgive the victim and himself . But a victim who sees herself as shamed or degraded , because of the attack , instead of seeing herself as hurt and frightened , but quite good , not shameful , not degraded , has a great deal of difficulty letting go of the aggressor . She will tend to hate the aggressor , not only for the attack , but also for her own  | feelings of self-degradation she feels he caused . She suffers selfhate . The hate of the aggressor enters the victim here , and until she can let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shamed , she maintains a mental exchange relationship with the aggressor whether or not she ever sees him again . This type of victim also has two to forgive ? herself , and the aggressor . This type of victim , comparable to the aggressor who can not rid himself of self-hate , has problems with forgiving . Sometimes such a victim becomes an aggressor . For example , hurt by one person , such a victim sometimes becomes aggressive and aims self-hate on others of the same type ( such as all men , or all women , or minorities ) who become victims . Most aggressors do not understand how it is that their self-hate makes them so aggressive . They do not know that the problem is in them and not in the victim . They find attributes in the victim which they think justify an attack . Anti-Semitism and other forms of scapegoating are partially perpetuated by this projected self-hate of the aggressor . Thus violence and other forms of aggressive abuse , even psychological abuse such as mean name calling , tend to lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But nonabusive , functional forms of conflicts to resolve issues without raising selfhate in participants and without projected self-hate tend to reduce aggressiveness and violence . A fight of one kind leads to more fighting ; a fight of another kind leads to less fighting . People often mistake the two forms of fighting and mistakenly avoid any form of conflict for fear of abusive escalation . Functional conflict might be seen as " fair fighting " and leads to balanced relationships . Abusive conflict leads to imbalance , or said another way , to diseased relationships . When there is true peace there is a relatively balanced moving equilibrium . Equilibrium really says equal-ibrium . It means perceived equality in a balance of gives and takes , a form of equity ways of saying justice . Given different perceptions , different perceived needs , scarce resources as perceived , equilibrium will tend toward disequilibrium . Functional conflict arises , it is resolved , and equilibrium is restored , in a continuing cycle . This is why a steadystate , no-change equilibrium actually strains and often breaks relationships . A real-life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolves problems as they occur . It handles and resolves perceived exchange imbalances and restores the equitable balance . It handles and resolves conflict . It moves toward disequi- librium , falls into disequilibrium , and then moves toward a new , higher balance with the process continuing as long as the relationship lasts . Relationships without this moving balance are no-growth relationships . No-growth relationships fall into exchange ruts . The ruts fill with accumulated dirt and garbage . This erodes clean , clear exchange lines and tracks . Eventually the exchange system becomes rusty , stagnant , brittle , with tendencies toward breakdown or breakup . A person with a " no-growth " mentality may suffer depression , boredom , and psychological or physical sicknesses . No growth in a social relationship is also a nearly certain sign that the potential for a sick relationship is high . In no-growth relationships feelings become repressed . Stagnation results . Life becomes boring . Where people do not care enough even to get on one another 's nerves , there are signs of stagnation and brittleness in the exchange relationship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions change , and petty annoyances accumulate , and major issues arise , then the relationship is flexible . It is able to enter and survive a series of ups and downs , highs and lows , through the process of **37;714;TOOLONG . This can be seen as a moving equilibrium which means in the beautiful language of opposites , a dialectic of a steady-state of constant change . The opposites of steady-state and constant change combine here to provide life to human relationships . There is peace on one issue that leads another unresolved issue to pop up . This in turn is argued , negotiated , and resolved . The result is a better , meaning a growing , moving equilibrium , leading only to the next crisis . The relationship spirals upward confronting and resolving crises . This leads to higher stages of reciprocal exchanges . When people get together in exchange there will be a pressure toward reciprocation leading to balance and equilibrium . But the seeds of disequilibrium are in the equilibrium . People have different needs , feelings , ideas , symbols ? so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( among other causes ) and the relationship tips toward disequilibrium . Disequilibriummanifested in an unresolved argument , a rebellion , a war , a fist fight , a shouting match , and in other forms of imbalance ? is time consuming , energy using , fatiguing , hurtful , and annoying . So the opposite demand and desire for equilibrium arises and people perceive the need to try to reach equilibrium again . Thus , to summarize , equilibrium has the seed of disequilibrium in it . Disequilibrium  | has the seed of equilibrium in it . One leads to the other . The study of this process of change where things move to differences and opposites , the wavelike ebbs and flows of events , is called dialectics . The concept of dialectics and analyses based on it are also built into the conflict perspective . Up is down . Down is up . A spacecraft going up from the earth is at the same time going down on the moon . In the same way conflict yields both pain and health . Stresses in relationships yield conflicts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and breakup . Conflict can also be the first step toward " righting " a " crooked " relationship . The result is another form of equilibrium . When people get along well the opposite is soon to come ( dialectics ) because the getting along keeps the people close and allows them to " rub each other the wrong way , " and to care about it too . When the people do not get along there are tendencies toward the opposite ? attempts at either reconciliation or breakup . When there is reconciliation there is equilibrium . Where there is breakup there is again an equilibrium , as the partners break the relationship in disequilibrium , and join other , more balanced relationships . In either case there is a tendency toward a new equilibrium , a dialectical process of change into differences and opposites . Dialectical processes occur in all areas of life . Dry ice ( frozen carbon dioxide ) is so cold that it can burn a person touching it . A conflict can lead to loving feelings . Loving feelings can lead to conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The death of a person liberates chemicals from the body . The chemicals fertilize the earth and yield life when they help the grass to grow . The grass attracts the cow which eats and kills it . The cow transforms the grass to milk , which is used to give life to calves and babies . The wastes created are then expelled to fertilize the earth . Note the dialectical chains ? the swings to differences and opposites which lead to sameness ? built into life . Sunny weather leads to rainy weather which leads to sunny as the sun bakes on and evaporates lake and sea water to make rain clouds which empty on the earth to allow the sun to shine through again . Conflict holds the same dialectical procedure in human life . The famed philosopher Georg Hegel saw historical processes as swings of thesis , antithesis , and synthesis . Edward Edinger , Jungian psychotherapist , writes : According to Hegel , all the movements and happenings in human history  | fall into a threefold cyclic pattern . First , an original position is conceived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite position is constellated , grows and finally overthrows the first . This is called the antithesis . In the final phase the onesidedness and inadequacy of the antithesis is recognized and replaced by a synthesis of the two opposites . The formula is thus : thesis , antithesis , synthesis . The synthesis can then become a new thesis through which the cycle is repeated . This was an insight of the first magnitude . It is supremely simple and self-evidently true once grasped . Whether or not this can be demonstrated in history , it can certainly be verified empirically in individual psychology . ' This insight can be applied as a " handle " to help analyze historical , political , economic , psychological , and social processes . It may even be used to analyze and understand the special historical , social , and psychological processes of love relations . Two lovers come together in a thesis , a synthesis of their separate lives . In time seeds of disequilibrium ( and conflict ) arise . Have you known anyone in such a relationship where problems did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the antithesis . The antithesis is either worked out in a new synthesis ( leading to thesis ) of their symbols , needs , wants , exchanges , or they break up and synthesize with other networks , leading to new theses . In both cases there is a thesis which will lead , in a developmental process , to antithesis , then synthesis . This has very important clinical applications . If a person can remember , while in a position of thesis , that antithesis is soon to come , by a developmental process built into life , then the cause for discontent , fault-finding , blame making is eliminated . When lovers come together it is a new thesis , a synthesis of their antithesis in their two separate lives . They are certain to conflict . This is an antithesis . Wise lovers are ready for conflict , expect it , and welcome it as part of a dialectical , developmental process which will bind their love and lives in a new synthesis . When a ball is thrown upward it comes down . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down . It has to come down . It was thrown upward in order to see it come down . How foolish it is to blame that lover who so happily tossed you up into a high for causing you to come down to a low . It is a very one-sided vision of life to credit someone with bringing you to a high , but not to expect that the high , as with a ball , must come to the lower position again . Love and your lover bring you high and they bring you low . Enjoy both positions . If you are in an " up " with a lover , or with yourself , or in your  | business , or in an economic cycle , the down is soon to come . Why blame anyone for it ? The feeling that love , work , school , life , or anything must always be " up " ? positive , good , or agreeable ? is untrue to the process of dialectics . Dialectics is a process of life . The misunderstanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interpersonal misery . Here expectations are out of line with reality . It is not negative reality that is at fault , but the perception of reality by the person perceiving it . People in a " down " position often fall to total hopelessness . They need to realize that the antithesis manifested in the difficulty ? if the appropriate work is done ? in time should lead to a new synthesis . A person in the depths grows by being there . He learns from his pain and unifies with the painful parts of life , thus going ahead . Study people who have experienced life crises . I predict that those who let themselves swing freely with the crises will say that crises are important regrouping plateaus for other orbital swings , based on greater understanding of life than they had before . They synthesize from the antithesis and this leads to a new thesis on another level of development . But many people today want everything to be good . They are in a rut too . Thank your mother or father for hurting you by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self . They are setting you up for a trip to a higher realm of being . Thank your teachers for low grades . They are pointing out errors that will keep you at a lower level of understanding if you do not perceive them . If you stop using up so much energy projecting your foolishness , failures and self-hate onto the teacher , who in a moment you see as unfair because of a low grade you earned , you might perceive that it is his duty to give low grades . The projection is that it is very likely that you are unfair . You have projected your unfairness , foolishness , and failure on your teacher and accuse him . But the problem is in your eye ? not his . You have made your teacher ( or lover , or parent or anyone else ) your mirror . It is yourself you see there . It is yourself you blame with such great anger . Your teacher did not fail the examination . You did . You put your failure on him and see the fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see there . You are angry at yourself but find it easier thinking you are angry at him . Why be angry at a teacher who grades your examination in a manner consistent with conscience and professional ethics ? It is very likely that this same teacher has graded most of his examina- tions with high grades . If you do not believe this , ask to see grades given by teachers and professors . Make it a matter of record ? not debate . But the person who receives a low grade does not wish to see the high grades that same teacher is capable of giving . The person with the low grade accuses the teacher of incompetence . But the person receiving a low grade in an educational system that so often gives passing and high grades ( sometimes even to illiterates ) is obviously the incompetent . Many people fall into this terrible trap of psychological projection , where one 's faults and self-hate are pasted on another , leading to what feels like justifiable anger at the other . This is destructive to good human relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deflecting your anger to someone else who is seen to be at fault , then you can do little about it if he does not wish to change for you . But if you realize that you are angry at yourself for your own incompetence , then there are many things you can do about it . It is , of course , easier to hate the other than to make personal change . But it is more productive to improve yourself . The student with a poor grade might place his energy to determine where he has erred . He might perceive the meaning of the subject by being forced to study harder to pass the next examination . He might become an educated person in a new synthesis . Or ? once and for all ? he might perceive himself as an incompetent student . Then he may take the necessary steps to achieve competence or look elsewhere for a synthesis of abilities . What about the possibility of incompetent teachers ? Do n't they exist ? Of course they do . Since I presume that fewer teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly to students here , and not mainly to teachers . But the same analysis applies to the incompetent teacher , who for example sees the students always as boring . Some effort ( competence ) with the students might bring them to life . But some motivation and life by the students might excite the teacher to a stimulating lecture that will not bore them . In this case we see that incompetence exists in relation to something else . It is an exchange relation . If there are other exchanges between teacher and students incompetence on either side may be cured . I suffered incompetent teachers too . This is not only a problem of today 's student . I attended what are now called ghetto schools . The schools I attended in Brooklyn , New York City , in fact some years ago became nationally infamous for their problems . But I  | became literate , educated , and an educator ? with imperfections ? with the same teachers and the same schools that supposedly led others to illiteracy , even to juvenile delinquency . So if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect school system , and others did not become educated in the same system , can we blame only the incompetent teachers and school system ? Oddly enough my efforts leading to academic success proved the competence of my teachers . They obviously taught me enough for academic success ? which by the way came only with an extraordinary amount of study , setbacks , and sometimes low grades too . But other students who did not engage in the same effort proved that their teachers were incompetent . Their teachers did not stimulate them to succeed in the educational system . Do you understand why we hold some responsibility for our social relations and systems , whether or not other people in our exchange relations look like they are " incompetent " ? It would be nice if everyone were competent . But I am not writing only about nice things . I am writing about reality that brings problems . A student told me that his schools ruined him by not teaching him how to write properly ( he is a university student who still does not know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompetent . I have no data so I can only say that he may be correct . But I do know that this student never registered for remedial courses freely available at the university . He had a chance to improve himself . Why did n't he take it ? He never took the pain or time to ask to learn how to write , even at the university . At this point he is responsible for his deficiencies . But he is still projecting blame . He is projecting blame now even if his teachers were incompetent . Someone says , " My parents were incompetent and that is why I have to do mean things . " The evaluation of incompetence may be correct or it may not be correct . But the judgement " I have to be violent , mean , illiterate , or anything else " is incorrect . Such a person can symbol , " I have to learn here and now to be a good person . " Some people do not want to take pain . They do not want to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything on someone else , and avoid the pain of accepting the antithesis , making new syntheses and new theses . Whether or not you are in a low condition because of someone 's incompetence , the fact remains that the low condition is now yours . If you can not write in longhand script ( an increasing number of my students can not )  | or if you can not express your ideas well , because of incompetent teachers , the fact still remains ? whatever the cause ? that you now lack competence . It is no use wasting energy looking for who is to blame . " Own up " to your condition because it is hindering your life . Take responsibility for seeking out a cure . Your incompetent teachers or parents may have been responsible for harming you " there and then . " But you are responsible for living well " here and now " ? or you suffer . Some people do not wish to live the antithesis . They are plants that refuse to be fertilized by smelly fertilizer . They will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will fertilize . Thank your lover for hurting your feelings by telling you something about yourself you did not like to hear . If you allow that dirt to fertilize , then you will grow and blossom . Your lover only told you something negative about yourself . You do not have to feel ruined , degraded , or worthless . If you feel these your self-hate will rise and likely will be projected on your lover . You have the start of a deteriorating relationship here . Just look into what he said . Improve yourself or tell him why you will not . Why hate yourself ? Why hate him ? If you understand dialectical processes you can harness dialectics . You can move with the dialectical tides . Good swimmers , or people who surfboard , do not fight the waves , but yield to their power and thus help themselves to get where they want to go ? with a minimum of wasted energy . They ride the waves ? the ups and downs . It is the same with dialectics . Fight dialectics and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and troughs and you will get some excitement in the ups and downs , and will come out ahead in self and social development . If you do not ride the crests and troughs you will be wiped out , washed out , and will not have the force of the waves to carry you forward . It is impossible to stay on the top wave forever ; you have to come down . But use that force ( the dialectical swing ) to build up momentum , to move at the proper moment , on the upswing , as the next wave comes . It is not easy to balance on a surfboard , moving forward . It is a " balancing act . " Life is a surfboard on which we all have to balance in a " balancing act " among the high waves and low troughs . How hard the surfer works to stay upright on the highs and lows ! It is not easy riding the crests and troughs of a career , love relationship , marriage ? or even on the swings of one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical work of life ? the art of living . It is your task to keep your head above water ? even on the downswing ? even when swamped ? always with the aim of movement , getting to land , growing , in a moving equilibrium . The dialectical processes teach us to ride high , but to be ready to swing low . Balance on each high and low . Keep moving forward . Dialectics of life and death , good moods and bad , health and sickness , success and failure , love and hate , peace and struggle are built into life : dialectical swings are the body of life . Those who understand , live with , anticipate , and remain balanced in dialectical swings move along and receive a thrill too ? as do the surfers on the high waves of Hawaiian waters . Harnessing dialectics is like harnessing the tides . It creates great life power . Harnessing the dialectics of opposites in positive-negative charges provides electricity to run large engines and to heat whole cities . Some couples ride the waves of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some students ride the waves of dialectical swings in their studies , in their classes , in their career development . Others go under at the slightest mishap . Some people take a failing grade , grab hold of their own hurt , do not deflect ( project ) that hurt on their teachers , learn from their errors , and do better . These harness the dialectics of their school experiences and keep their balance on the downswing , using the downswing as a preparation and force for the upswing . They make successes from their failures . And from their successes they wait for the new problems , pressures , difficulties , pains , and varied failures that their new higher positions will bring by the very special nature of those positions . These people are always preparing ? ready to move when the move is ready . Others walk around angry at others for " giving " them low grades . Study cases of both types of people ? those who are angry at failures and those who make good use of them ? using dialectics as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will find that these successful types make good use of the pain in their lives . They make growth experiences of their failures and troubles , which gives them momentum to survive the bad times , and the strength , experience and knowledge to move up on the high waves of the good times . Some people are wiped out at every wave , high and low . The world is full of drowning people . The successful maintain balance , keep their heads above the water even when swamped ?  | and keep moving forward . They enjoy swinging with the highs and lows . They know that this is what comes from being alive . You can not ride the surf in a stagnant pond . If you marry for good times you will be disappointed . If you marry for good times and bad you have harnessed dialectics , and you will enjoy the good times , knowing that because of the good ( your increased care and concern about the other and increased closeness ) , bad must come in the form of disagreement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners work through functional conflict , with the faith and hope and joy of knowing that the positive dialectically stands on the other side . There is no disappointment . There is no blame placed on self or other . The partners know that good and bad are part of the same dialectical process in the relationship . There would not be a relationship , but indifference , without the moving equilibrium of dialectical swings into opposites . The partners enjoy the good but know that the bad is lying latent . When the bad comes the partners are not surprised or disappointed . They anticipated it by their knowledge of dialectics . They married for highs and lows . Thus they can accept the lows as well as the highs and do not blame one another for lows . They understood the marriage vows that advised living together through good and bad and in health and sickness . They work at turning the latent good to the foreground when bad comes up . Such a vision is realistic , matching the swings of life from opposite to opposite . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , city of residence , house , or anything else , do not ask what all the benefits are , but ask what is the " bundle of goods and bads " with which you want to live . Then swing with the crests and troughs of that which you freely choose . Different people , different jobs , different cities , all have different bundles of positives and negatives , but all have positives and negatives . Choosing a life partner because he/she is " great " is a poor choice , because you have not chosen his/her faults that you must live with too . Choose who you would like to live with through the dialectical swings of highs and lows . Choose with whom you want to ride the waves ? with crests and troughs . Choose with whom you want to be swamped and whose head you wish to help keep above water . You are now ready to move forward . You are harnessing dialectics . Dialectical processes can not easily be fought , but they can be  | harnessed . You can not fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can harness it . Spacecraft and aircraft do not fight ups and downs but they harness them . Sailors of sailboats do not fight tides and winds , but they skillfully harness these to go in the direction desired . Even when the winds and tides move in other directions , a skilled sailor harnesses the power and moves forward to his destination ? sometimes left , sometimes right , sometimes becalmed ? but always in the long run forward ? toward the desired land . You do not wish to love and marry to have conflict and to work it out ? Then stay unmarried . But there is no escape from dialectics . The single state also has its own bundle of , pleasures and pains , its own ups and downs , its own dialectical swings . You can escape marriage by remaining single , and you can escape the problems of the single life by marrying , but you can not escape dialectics of good and bad , wrapped into different bundles . Many people spend a lifetime trying to escape dialectical swings to bad . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy trying to harness dialectics , even the swing to bad , instead . Use dialectics as a handle to study processes in revolution , war , religion , nations , and marriages . Do the same dialectical processes exist in all ? The study of religious groups shows that a common developmental process is that small groups dissatisfied with their large churches tend to break away to form sects , new groups where people worship in close , emotional , involved , caring relationships with one another and with religion . If successful the group grows . The growing numbers of people are more than a few leaders can handle informally . Administrators , scribes , and other specialists are hired . Accounting books must be kept . Property is bought and must be maintained . Bureaucratic units develop to handle records and paperwork . Authorities are needed to make and enforce rules . The result is a large , bureaucratic church , in which there will tend to be breakaway factions again , factions which dislike the conservative and bureaucratic trend of their church . They want " real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only one example of the dialectics of life . Dialectics can be used to help guide observations , research , and analysis . Dialectics can be used as an analytical tool for understanding and even predicting outcomes of social and life relationships . With prediction there can be control . Dialectical processes can not be stopped . But by control it is meant that the dialectical swings can be harnessed .  | Critics of dialectics are fond of pointing to scientific studies which show that , for example , Hegel 's formulation does not apply to a specific case . So in some cases we might say that the scientific utility is low . But the analytical utility still might remain high . It is a good analytical " handle " to understand life processes , and even to guide research . If it is used to guide research that proves it does not apply , then dialectics or any other handles on life still are useful . It is a common feeling that research which disproves something is less worthy than research which proves the hypothesis . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have more utility in teaching us something about ourselves and life than a success . The process of life is more important than the symbol , " success " or " failure . " The process of research is important for building knowledge . If a drug is proven to be useless for treatment of a disease , this then is an important finding , and other researchers will look elsewhere . The researcher has not failed . He will , if wise , use the research process again with other drugs . It is the same with dialectics . For my purposes in this book whether you prove something or not with dialectics is less important than whether it is useful in helping you to grasp , analyze , study , and cope with complex , interlocking human events . In fact , dialectics can be used so broadly , as I use it here ? as swings , highs , lows , waves , ebbs and flows , processes , movements of differences to sameness and sameness to differences , and **27;753;TOOLONG ? that depending on the units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything can be proven with it . I use other perspectives in a very broad manner too . Scientists might be disturbed by this . If anything can be proven with dialectics then what is its scientific utility ? The utility is that we can learn a great deal by looking for and understanding dialectics ( or exchange or conflict or any of the other perspectives in this book ) as a series of processes which might be wider or narrower , longer or shorter , higher or lower , more or less applicable in specific cases . Let us not presume that the symbol system of science is the only useful one . Science is a symbol system used for its own purposes . There are other truths . For example , it is common medical knowledge that any substance given to a patient as a drug has a tendency to make the patient feel better . So common is this that a special term has been coined and such a medication is known as a " placebo . " So common is this " placebo effect , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do " double blind " studies in their research . The patient and the prescribing physician do not know which is the test drug and which is an inert substance because this knowledge may bias the results . Only the researcher knows by code . It is expected that the research must clearly prove greater benefits to patients with the drug than with the inert materials before the drug can be seen as curative . But a placebo proven scientifically ineffective for cure in effect clinically does cure some patients . The cure is clear . Without it a specific patient feels sick . With it the patient feels better . A placebo is a very effective medication by the test of whether it makes a patient feel better . So on one scientific level the placebo is a failure . But scientific study can prove it is a success too because it clearly can cure , but not for any known laboratory-proven reason . Other research shows that the body has a very effective immune system which can be rallied by mental states , such as hypnosis , faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? can be effective , not because of the specific content of the treatment , but because of the rallying effect on the mind which probably rallies the immune system . Scientifically we can show a treatment to be useless because its content is worthless as proven in studies , but we can scientifically show the same treatment to be effective by study of perceptions of patients and how these affect the mind and body . There is a current of thought in some scientific circles that studies with laboratory proof are worthy , but it is felt that studies of subjective perceptions as realities ? for example the proven worth of a treatment based on faith and hope ? are pure nonsense . I do not share these scientific biases ? and they are biases ? and write , think , and act accordingly . A drug can be proven scientifically to have low utility for cure . But clinically it can work . When scientists prove to doctors and to the public that certain medications and treatments do not work , then the placebo effect is lost , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every astute physician knows this ? to prescribe the exact cure scientifically proven effective for a disease , but where no scientifically known cure is available then they should use any nonharmful treatment , with an exhibit of a great deal of confidence and tender , loving care . The clinical utility here is that the patient may well feel better . It is the same with dialectics and with any of the other theoretical perspectives I am discussing in this book . This or that scientific  | study may or may not prove it valuable for one particular case . But the analytical and clinical utilities remain high . So until someone can find something better we remain with concepts such as dialectics , which by the way are not so easily laid to rest . They keep rising again and again because they are needed . The test of worth of the concepts are : Do they help people to understand what they found it difficult to understand earlier without them ? Do they help them to feel better ? Get in touch with your feelings and ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialectical swings of marriage or whatever ? If so , then the concept has utility , no matter what the scientific precision . The conflict perspective perceives that scarce resources are a major cause of conflict . When two cars try to be in the same scarce space at one time there is an accident . When all family members want use of the one family bathroom at the same time there is potential for conflict . When some want the right to study quietly and others want the same space for the right to listen to music noisily , and if no one is willing to yield , then there is an accident , a conflict , disequilibrium . Time , money , space , food , and anything else may be seen as scarce , meaning there are perceived limits to how much everyone can get of them . While arrangements can be made to spend and give more in exchange with others , still there are perceived limits . These limits lead to conflict . Where there are four slices of pie and five hungry people wanting pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perceived scarcity . Everyone will try to get a piece . The one left out will fight for a share . The four pieces can be cut to make the equivalent of a fifth , or another share , to share , which is why scarce resources are often a perception too , built on symbols , reinforced through interaction , thus making scarcity a social reality but not necessarily an objective reality . Nevertheless perceptions lead to actions that make objective fact . If a resource is seen as scarce , it will be so treated , making it scarce . What is a scarce resource as perceived in one society may not be so for another . Sex is a scarce resource in our Western world . Not all who want it get it . But some casual types share much sex and thus prove the nature of scarcity as a perception . Physical nurturing such as hugging is also a resource in scarce supply in our society . Many men and women with an intimate partner would fight against  | and be jealous about their partner providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection . I would presume that most kind , charitable , good-hearted husbands and lovers would not accept a partner who shares her affections even among the permanently crippled in veteran 's hospitals , with men who are so crippled that they never leave their beds , men who in many cases have had no heterosexual response in a lifetime . The lover of one woman would likely feel that the physical response is his and his only , not to be shared . A beautiful movie , " Coming Home " artistically portrayed such sharing and responses to it in the life of a male paraplegic , a woman , and her husband . Males to a good extent and females certainly are capable of sexual giving far beyond the needs of one partner . This objectively makes nothing really scarce to a lover whose partner shares with another . There is enough emotional and sexual response for more than one . But the taboo against such sharing creates jealousy and refusal to share , which makes the resource of love and sex really scarce . In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share indeed is scarce . Merely sharing makes it abundant . There are societies in which sexual norms do involve sharing . It was considered highly improper for a man in some Eskimo groups not to offer his spouse to a traveler who stopped to visit . There are peoples where it would have been considered improper for a woman not to share her man , and the man not to share his love and procreative powers with a spouse 's sister who lost her husband , with no further men to marry ? men being in short supply because of war related deaths . I am not suggesting that sexual and social norms be broken haphazardly . There may well be severe social sanctions to pay . For purposes of analysis , I do suggest that a list of scarce societal resources be made , with thought about which are actually scarce , because however one looks there are limits built into life , and which are created scarcities because of societal arrangements and norms . Sex is such a created scarcity . I claim your entire list will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually scarce , scarce in essence , instead of made scarce by a scarcity mentality . Those who do not have access to scarce resources often want the access and the resources . They may engage in conflict to get a share . When those who do not have access to the resources made scarce determine that sharing would make abundance , but when others refuse to share , those without the resources become embit- tered . They may fight for a share . They may steal a share . The bitterness resulting from unfulfilled wants or lost access to resources taken by another , and attempts at taking and protecting what is considered a just share also lead to conflict . Scarce resources and conflict are related . The conflict may lead to violence and varied other dysfunctional events . The conflict may lead to a new distribution of resources in a new balance . Where five people want an available four pieces of pie , then they can share and expand the limits . Thus to say " no more available " is only a perception , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see to it that the one left out keeps his hands off what is available . So by saying , " no more pie left , " there is no more pie left , even though there could have been more if those who had pie decided to share , thus avoiding the scarcity . We can cut the four to make a fifth piece , thus making , in a moment , a scarce resource an abundant one . But suppose one hundred want the four pieces ? If all share everyone gets so little that it is not satisfying to any . The hundred will still conflict over the four pieces , if they perceive the pie as a value . But they can learn not to make the pie a value . And we can bake more pies to give all what they want . Although there is a limit to how much one pie can provide , some creative , openhearted thinking would soon provide the solution of finding other wants , and/or baking more pies . At some point all ingredients run out so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our society have come to the limit of sharing possibilities . Even when there is drought and thus limited food so some starve , we can ask the question about what misuse of the scarce resource of fertile land was made that helped turn ? with the help of weather ? fertile land into desert . The study of many drought areas will show the hand of greedy humans as a prime cause of the disaster . The unwillingness to give more to the land ( in essence to share with nature ) and to take less ends with nothing for anyone . It has been said that a prime part of Western culture is based on the scarcity principle . Scarce resources are made of what might be freely available . This forces people into need and hunger positions , and competition for " goods " ( that which is considered good ) , and into separate conflicting groups of haves and have-nots . Even love ? frequently in the family ? is hoarded . So scarce have signs of love become that television advertisements and automobile stickers ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " These try to  | break perceptions and thus the reality of hugging as a scarce resource , with the negative effects it has on people . For goodness sake ? indeed for the sake of goodness ? why ca n't we at least give hugs freely ? Sometimes people tend toward conflict because various emotional needs are not met . Many conflict-prone people , those who always must find and make a conflict for the sake of making and being in trouble rather than for problem resolution , would tend less toward it if they were given appreciation , respect , recognition , compliments , love , and care . These are made into scarce resources . They are hoarded and are kept in short supply . So usual is it to hoard these , so little are these given , so little are they expected , that there are many people who do not even know how to react positively to a compliment but become embarrassed . In a circular response there are some who do not wish to give compliments because they are not accepted well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept tender emotional resources . They enrich society and the lives of people . They give the strength even to do without more concrete resources , such as houses and the like . And let those with houses be reminded that a house is a resource of wood and brick . Love in that house makes it a home , which is a very different resource , qualitatively perceived . While you are trying to get your perceived share of the social pie , keep giving and accepting love , respect , and the like . While money , food , and jobs can be shared , it is not always simple to achieve a just distribution , given the scarcity mentality of modern Western society . But love is always a potential that can be pulled right from the mind . Land , political power , or money are not needed to give love . Just turn it on and give it out . The more given , the more one wants to give , and the more that develops . So why do we persist in hoarding that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to let some out ? Does it feel good being " up tight " with love ? Does it feel better letting a great deal of it out ? I would claim blocked love is a pain . Released love makes one feel good . Have you ever given out all that you have ? I would say that this is impossible . By the act of giving love , more develops . To use language from natural resource management , love is a self-renewing resource . I would like to emphasize that giving love , giving hugs , giving someone a neck , face , or back massage indeed is self-renewing . It renews the self of the receiver and it renews the self of the giver . When I  | give somone a massage I am always astonished at how loving and tender it makes me feel ! Recipients always have responded tenderly , too . Love may well be made abundant . But high grades in school should be scarce if the appropriate work and understanding are not reflected in examinations . This is because the negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to higher levels of learning . There are many teachers who have given high grades to all students . They think this is a sign of love . They are quite mistaken . Such students with meaningless high grades have often been shocked to find out that they are unemployable because they are illiterate . They always passed examinations . Little did they know that their writing was substandard . It would also be better for all of us if professors in all professional schools , including medical schools , remained strict with grades . We would be better assured of the quality of professional practitioners once they have their degrees . A low grade can reflect an abundance of care about the student and society . Teachers can give low grades because they care enough about their students to hurt them and to put up with their conflict when they are angered by the grades . Their high grades are scarce but their love still is abundant . What would social relationships , society , school , or the family feel and look like with an open sharing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive thoughts and deeds ? If you wish to take the risks , add some of these variables to your social relationships . Study the results . This is a type of sociological experimental research . The point has been made that conflict may be seen as functional for clearing the air ( and relationship ) of accumulated tensions , perceived imbalances , and the like . Here , above , I have been suggesting that to add a model of abundance , rather than scarcity , as with love and hugs , would lead to less conflict . If conflict is functional , why try to avoid it ? The point is that conflict is functional under certain conditions . Under certain conditions an argument between lovers might help one partner become aware that he is indeed making love , hugs and respect scarce resources , and must stop this if the relationship is to be maintained as one of love . When that partner makes abundant what he made scarce , there is a new equilibrium and a growth relationship . Thus conflict can be functional in bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | But when I advise that we should avoid conflict by making things abundant and by understanding others , my advice is meant to avoid the need for functional conflict . That saved energy can be spent on other pursuits or on the working out of other troublesome or potentially troublesome issues . Disease is functional in helping a person to change ways of living which led to the disease . But medical practitioners engage in preventive medicine to help people to live well so they do not need the lesson of disease to create life changes . And even then , medical practitioners inject disease entities into people on a routine basis , for example Polio virus , to create a controlled bodily conflict which will create an immunity to uncontrolled infections by the same but stronger virus . The whole science of immunology uses this principle of functional conflict . It is in the same way that I advise to engage in conflict and to set conditions in which it is not needed . If this confuses you there is no easy way out of it . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact part of the dialectics of conflict . Think it through and you will grasp this principle . I will repeat it again , because it is essential for good living : Engage in functional conflict for functional ends . Also set conditions where it will not be necessary , and where energy then can be put on other life problems and needs . Manage conflict well by openly confronting and resolving issues . Manage life well so a problem can be resolved even before the need for conflict and the saved energy can go into conflict on other issues or into other life activities . For example , as problems are avoided by decreasing scarcity which leads to conflict , energy and attention can be put on other points of pressure or pleasure , constantly bringing society , people , and social relationships to higher and higher growth . There are American Indian peoples who do not have a scarcity mentality . Their children sometimes cheat on examinations at whiteled schools . A child may give his friend a correct answer so he does not have to do without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examinations . When they perceive that their friends do not know the answers , they may purposely answer questions incorrectly so they will not cause the friends who can not answer correctly to lose self-respect . If necessary , all do poorly together . For such children it might be better to dispense with examinations . Set the whole group to a cooperative venture of determining the correct answers to questions , where those who understand the subject do  | not make their understanding scarce , but instead share by helping those who do not understand . The misunderstanding of the Indian way of sharing ? among other intricate processes ? led to violent conflicts between American settlers and some Indian tribes . The pioneer migrants gave some trinkets or other Indian perceived valuables to a tribe for some land . The pioneers thought that they now owned the land , and if they did , by their perception of fair exchange , no one else did , and no one else had the right to it . What was plentiful to the owner became scarce to the propertyless . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pioneer 's trinkets just as settlers took berries from bushes on Indian land . They owed nothing in return except open sharing . When Indians freely took berries , game , wood , water , or even passage through what became white-owned land they were considered to be trespassers . These Indians did not perceive of land within their territory as a scarce resource . What was on it was freely shared by everyone in it . But these Indians were blocked from free land because of the trinkets they accepted as the price for the sale of land . They were outraged . The pioneers were outraged at free use of land by those who had sold it . An Indian with an abundance mentality might give something to a white . The Indian gave it to share . The white with a scarcity mentality perceived it was now his owned by him and unavailable for someone else . A few days later the Indian might pass by in the absence of the white , enter the house , and take back what he gave . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in use was not scarce and if he needed it he took it , just as he gave it to someone who needed it . Many years ago whites gave the label , " Indian givers " to such Indians , meaning those who give , but who do not respect the rights of the new owners and freely take back . This negative symbol , based on a scarcity model of life , has remained to the very day . The white sees an Indian giver in a negative light . But such an Indian gives and takes what is not in use and does not make scarce what could be freely available . In his perception he is good and the white is stingy . Think through possibilities of your own where scarce funds , time , effort , objects , can be made less scarce by some creative thinking and creative changes . What life changes would you wish to make for sharing your resources , as by harder work , and sharing some of  | the results with others ? How about even giving someone a compliment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug , or a back massage ? Why are these resources made so scarce ? Are they really scarce or are you just " tight " with your resources ? How about demanding less and giving more ? How about reworking your time and its management so you have more time to give to your family , friends , employers , or school work ? How about forgoing the purchase of the next phonograph record ? Where can the saved monetary resource now go ? If you drank water instead of soda pop what would the savings be ? Where could the savings go ? Can you perceive any losses to you ? I can not . But if many people did as you , they and you would help throw the softdrink industry into an economic crisis and their workers into unemployment . And your health may be better without the excess sugar . Scarce energy resources would also be saved . The machines of this industry would not use energy in production of the products . Delivery trucks would not use scarce fuel supplies . So what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up the binding of society in the vision of the conflict perspective . Make a list of twenty-five material resources of an average middle-class family which they could do without and survive without with little life disruption . Try the fourth or even third or even second pair of shoes of each family member , the second radio , the stereo , knickknacks . Add your own . I have browsed through large city department stores and realized that barely a thing sold there was essential for human survival . And the few things that are needed , such as coats for winter , could be made with less concern for fashion and more for function . Could a part of a wage-earner 's job be shared , with little family disruption , with someone who has no job ? The payment for such sharing is only that of doing without the unnecessary extras that the extra wage slice earns . Could a family skip a few movies each year ? Could the saved funds go toward less paid employment , or more paid charity , or toward increased taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government agencies and businesses decreased office space to that actually used instead of for " show , " more money would be available for more social programs and lower taxes by government , and lower prices from businesses . One president of a financially depressed airline moved corporate headquarters from overexpensive and overstuffed large-city skyscrapers into  | cheap barracks alongside a major airport . This saved money . He also decreed that executives help unload baggage from planes . This improved speed of baggage handling with no extra corporate cost . It also gave the executives some healthy exercise . And it served the function of getting the executives in touch with blue-collar workers , customers , and the daily operations of the actual business , away from the artificiality of their desks . It would be presumed that these executives did not have to jog round and round a track for health . They loaded and unloaded baggage instead . Creative thinking led to an increase of monetary and personnel resources which became , in action , less scarce . How much should a businessman charge for a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incurred losses for many years and paid not a cent for years to stockholders who are supposed to be the true owners , earn at the same time over one quarter of a million dollars salary ( plus fringe benefits ) per year ? Why should an airline pilot earn more than $50,000 per year when the clerk working for the same airline , many more hours per week , receives less than one-third of this ? Why should a tobacco farmer receive government help to produce a crop which the government itself says is harmful to the health of its users ? The same government tries to discourage smoking . Why should a farmer receive government funds for not planting part of his crop ? Why should a farmer own land that in reality belongs to a long Indian heritage ? Why should a ghetto family receive welfare payments ? Why does a welfare family begrudge a farmer his price-crop subsidy and why does a farmer look down on the " free-loader " supported by welfare subsidy ? How is it that we have crop surpluses destroyed when there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers are encouraged not to plant full fields when there are starving people in the world ? Here a system is created whereby scarcity is encouraged to keep prices high . I have opinions but no simple answers to these questions . But these questions and thousands of others like them show the pushes and pulls on perceived scarce resources and their distribution . All these questions and their resolutions make the fabric of society in the vision of the conflict perspective . They are questions of scarce resource allocation . Many rich people do not wish to share their riches with poorer people . Many feel that they have given the limit ( a symbol ) in social  | welfare programs supported by high taxes . They need their money . They could also forgo the purchase of a second car , or a second television set , or a dishwasher , or a subscription to a magazine , or two movies per person per year . Would n't they still survive ? They perceive a limit which is only in their minds . In reality they can afford more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken instead of steak and still survive . They could eat a sandwich made at home for a business lunch , instead of a thirty dollar meal with wine at a fine restaurant . They could forgo a vacation and wear an unstylish ( another symbol ) coat another year . All of this can occur without excessive life disruptions . The money saved can be shared with others . But by symbol , subjectively , they feel otherwise . Hence this leads to a perception of scarce resources , and when others press for them there is conflict . The poor too can want less and demand less . They can stop smoking and save money and health . They can sacrifice the procreative pleasures leading to large families . They can spend time saved from employment , because of forced unemployment , cleaning and keeping clean the dirt-filled streets in their ghetto neighborhoods . If their neighborhoods are already clean they can plant trees and flowers and help the aged . But here too there are different perceptions of fairness and unfairness . Why should the poor forgo a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effort to clean dirt the city could clean ? Some readers may already be angry at these few lines , which is a good sign that there are conflicting perceptions leading to potential conflict . The American social security system shows signs of potential bankruptcy . The government proposes a decrease in some benefits and an increase in some payments into the fund and numerous factions and coalitions cry out in rage . They fight to block these changes . Those who must make more payments do not wish to do so and use pressure methods to avoid this . Those who must take a decreased benefit do not wish to accept this and use pressure methods to avoid this . If payments in do not balance payments out the system will fail . Yet on each side of the equation , those on that side want to give little and want to take much , closing their minds to potentials of failure of the entire system at such a point that no one will get anything . These people do not perceive the greater goal of cooperation necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security fund are becoming scarce because of the in- creased number of people living into older years . Thus there is conflict and strain in the social security , governmental , and social systems . Where people with differences in perceptions perceive different limits and have different perceptions of what is scarce , then leaders in that social system must work to create broader perceptions among the public , where symbols can be shared so people can perceive common goals . Actually , I perceive such leadership is a very scarce resource . We have not had too much of such leadership for many years . Have we had any ? Land is scarce . There is certainly an objective limit to the amount of land in a given space . ( Even here human ingenuity proves abundance . A building is layered , one hundred stories high , on top of the same scarce parcel of land . Thus skyscrapers are born . People in effect stand on top of and below one another . ) When varied groups want , and perceive rights to the same land ? which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatherland , holy land ? then there is conflict . Many wars are fought on this very issue . American Indians perceive that American land is theirs . They have been demanding a return of some of these lands . Non-Indian farmers and other property " owners " refuse to give up the land that they paid for , worked , and often inherited from their forefathers . The Israelis perceive the land they live on and Jerusalem and the West Bank as theirs by historical and even Biblical right . The Palestinians , and others , perceive that same land as being theirs and can prove rights too . There is conflict . Minority groups ( also a symbol ) , such as blacks and women , demand scarce jobs , and want affirmative action in hiring to give balance to past discrimination . This is , by their perception , only fair . Male whites and their kin want equal rights to the same jobs . This is , by their perception , only fair . Besides they were not even alive when black minority peoples were enslaved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two conflicting perception , need , and symbol systems fall on one job available . Two is not perceived to fit into one and there is conflict . These people could share jobs ( as pie can be shared ) . But no one has thought of this . It is necessary for some leader to instil this new value , as a resolution to the conflict , into people 's minds . Each could receive half the job and half the pay . There is sacrifice to be made by each . Half might be too little , but it is better than none  | for one of the people . Yet there are some people who will fight for the entire share , in wars , or driving a city or other system to bankruptcy so no one benefits . Actually , if each American job were decreased by a small portion , only a few hours per week , and salaries decreased proportionally , and if willing and able unemployed people were given jobs from the saved hours and salaries , then all should have less than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside looking in . But it is now a matter of all or none in too many cases , and conflict is built-in . There are times , however , when less than all is none . Solomon knew that to cut a baby , which two mothers claimed , into half for each would be to give each nothing . By making the offer he showed that equal fairness in this case was unfair to both and to the life rights of the baby . He also proved which of the women was a worthy mother . She was the one who would rather see the other woman claim the baby than to see it mutilated so each received half . The art of conflict resolution is a very subtle and complicated one . There are many sides ( perceptions ) to a conflict and its resolution . It is yet the more complicated when coalitions of interested parties form , demanding rights to perceived scarce resources , each conflicting coalition with conflicting inner factions within them . The interweaving network of society and social and political and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the threat of and resolution of conflict maintaining balances . I could advise the saving of scarce energy resources by abolishing the entire cosmetics , phonograph record , soft drink , junk foods and other such nonessential industries . People can live well without any of these products . But then there will be conflict in the form of mass demonstrations , legal and political maneuvers , and an outcry of rage by all the affected people . If I were a leader I would wish to abolish these industries . But it is doubtful if I could survive the conflict to remain a leader for long if I did abolish these industries . Thus , conflict and its threat serves to maintain the social structure . This could be seen as functional by those who like the social structure as it is , and dysfunctional by those who would like to see some change . Conflict , as in revolution , can also break the social and political structure and can cause new structures to be formed . Some people like this and some do not . So whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptions . Even here , just to raise these possibilities ? then to back down ?  | might be seen as functional to raise alternative possibilities in the eyes of the public , who might possibly change some of their behavior , forcing industrial or other dominants to look closely at how they function . Conflict , under certain circumstances ? in an extreme case revolution and in other cases as in a family crisis ? can lead to social change . Sometimes conflict can help maintain the status quo . In any case , the power of conflict pushes and pulls the system and the people in it in such a way that the network of social relations is glued together . This is a prime vision of the conflict perspective of theory and analysis . It is not possible for anyone to maintain or to change or advise changing or to disrupt existing social , political and economic relations without considering the effects in relation to conflict . So leaders think twice , so to speak , before acting and consider management of conflict as one of their prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on this sticky glue of conflict . They can do little in relation to the social networks of exchanges making the social relations in which they are leaders without handling the threat of conflict , existing conflict , and conflict resolution . If they wish to make systemic changes , they have to unglue and promptly reglue the various disruptions of balance ( disequilibrium ) taking the form of conflict and its threat . Society is an interactive framework , not only of exchanges , but an interactive framework of constant pushes and pulls between haves and have-nots . The fabric of society , according to the conflict perspective , is also seen as attempts at creating values of want , such as making people want to give much work and money for products sold by others , or wanting to eat pie when a good portion of the population is overweight anyway . Society is also seen as the creation of production , economic , and distribution systems to provide for the wants created , and the creation of administrative , legal , police , normative , moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have and have-not " resource questions settle into ' a social system of series of disequilibriums . Some of the issues making for disequilibrium are settled . Then there is a social moving equilibrium where other conflicts come up to be resolved . The pushes and pulls actually balance the equilibrium . Society is seen as being composed of pushes and pulls of have/have-nots , a bunch of ongoing and resolved , smoldering , unresolved , controlled conflicts . Soci-  | ety is seen as being composed of law , politics , leadership , police , armies , morality , and conscience , that all serve to control conflict . In addition , society is composed of balances of power , shifting balances of power , factions , coalitions , domination , subordination , and insubordination . This is the view of the conflict perspective . What is society but a bunch of exchanges based on the struggle between factions , between haves and have-nots , between dominants and subordinates , the powerful and powerless , and peace keepers and moral and social codes holding people into some level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The art of politics is the art of balancing haves and have-nots , factions , powerful and weak , dominants and subordinates , slicing the social and political pies , negotiating , resolving conflicts , managing issues , giving , taking , taking from the people and paying back , gaining and using power , creating , managing and satisfying interest groups and coalitions . The work of an American president is almost totally that of managing conflict . Follow the life of the president for several weeks through accounts in newsmagazines . It is clear that conflict management is his work and life . It is not only the president who is involved in the daily management of conflict . A foreman , an office work supervisor , a mayor , even a husband and wife , parents and children , engage in faction formation , conflict management , coalition formation , use of power , and do everything the president does . The president works with factions in Congress , labor , management , ethnic groups , and many others . The president works with the big variables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the military . Mother , father , brother and sister do the same as the president , but on issues of bedtime , and who will take the garbage out . The conflict perspective can be used to analyze all types and levels of human behavior . Some Practice Work with the marriage case in the Appendix and with any other conflict you wish . Ask these questions , and others , and find answers . Use these as guides for conflict perspective research and analysis .

SHAKESPEARE As You Like It ( act 2 , scene 1 ) DRAMATURGICAL ANALYSIS perceives of life as a drama . It makes sense of the complicated ongoing show called life by using terms and perspectives of the theater . The words of the theater are part of the dramaturgical analyst 's repertoire . These words are used to make the complications and contortions of social life understandable . Social events , group processes , and relationships between people are clarified through perceptions of life as theater productions . People play roles . A person may play the role of clown in the circus . Such a clown holds a formal role as part of his status position . Others just " clown around " wherever they are , but they are not circus performers . Such people play the informal role of clown . That is their act . Clownish scripts are part of their repertoire . Others play the role of scholar , or " everything happens to me , " or " joker . " There are many more such roles and many combinations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar , a formal role he plays as part of his status position of university professor . But he may also play the informal role of clown , or comedian , at the same time , making his students and colleagues laugh at his antics and jokes . Can you think of the usual roles you play ? Your repertoire ? How about people you know ? Research the roles and scripts and repertoires of various groups and specific people within these groups . Watch people closely as they act their parts in their usual lives . A  | fascinating show unfolds . Their behavior becomes more understandable . If the roles they play can be determined , then their behavior can be predicted . We need to find out the roles people play and then we can expect certain behavior appropriate to those roles to unfold . As the show unfolds we observe whether the behavior meets our predictions or not . We analyze the causes and effects of the behavior . Dramaturgical analysis can stand , in this manner , and in other ways , as a guide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one form of sociological research and analysis . What are the functions of people 's acts ? What are the dysfunctions ? Dysfunctional by what standards ? What is the outcome of a limited repertoire for each of the actors and actresses in a life show ? What is the outcome for people 's lives and well-being when they stick to the same script instead of expanding their repertoires ? What kinds of performances do they give in their life shows ? Are they drawn in too many directions by trying to play too many shows at once ? Why does n't a person with conflicting roles " get his act together " ? How can he be helped to " get his act together " ? Do you know people who act out neurotic or near psychotic or delinquent roles ? How could they find other avenues for self-expression that would be more functional for themselves and for others ? Do they let stage fright keep them from stages they want to be on and in , and from roles they wish to play ? Professional actors and actresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . They have no call to fame if they do not overcome their stage fright . Do you act parts in fantasy but lack the courage to try out , to go onstage , to perform unaccustomed roles ? What are the effects ? Do you want your claim to fame to be fulfilled ? You will have to swallow your stage fright and do what every performer does : get into the act , go onstage , go on with the show , and see what happens . I am a very frightened person before giving a speech , but I have always survived , and glory in being on the center of stage . If I avoid public performances to eliminate stage fright which I do not like , I would not benefit by being on the center of stage , the center of attraction , and receiving applause , all of which I do like . People 's acts can often be improved by getting better supporting actors and actresses into the show . A person may improve a performance by dropping those who get him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cues . How about becoming a better sup- porting actor or actress yourself so other people can put on better life shows ? How about refining your character so you do not have to depend so much on other people 's cues for any improvement of your act ? Or perhaps you need to refine- your character so you are more open to good people 's cues , which might lead you toward better performances . What would other people and groups be like if they changed their behavior after asking and answering these questions ? Analyze the behavior of people dramaturgically to determine how they act their roles , which roles they choose , which supporting actors and actresses they choose , with what results . Are there groups of people who are observed to fall into bad acts ? Do research on their behavior . How could they refine their character structure ? What would be the effects ? The behavior of delinquents can be fruitfully analyzed this way . Thus far this is only an introduction to dramaturgical analysis . There are many more dimensions to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scenes can be studied dramaturgically . Settings and scenes are where the roles are played , where certain roles are elicited and others are confined and considered inappropriate . Settings and scenes are where and for what actors and actresses ( the participants ) learn , change , refine and present lines in their acts . For example , school , home , bedroom , factory are where certain acts are set . In these settings ( physical environments ) , scenes are played out , such as learning , loving , and working . Scenes and settings have props such as beds and desks . Some props are focus points . They can also serve as backdrops for the act . In America sex is an act played out on props called beds . Why not on fur carpets on the floor ? Although some people sometimes do move their acts into unexpected places the bed still remains a focal point for sex in America and this prop thus takes on special dramaturgical significance . But the bed can be part of the backdrop at times other than sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People set certain props in certain ways when guests are to arrive . They are setting the stage for special effects . They are trying to arrange the props for certain scenes . They may wish to change the setting of living quarters into a setting appropriate for a party scene . Props and settings help stimulate certain feelings , responses , and actions . A person may put fresh flowers on the table as a prop to fix the setting , to set a romantic scene for the guest who is soon to arrive . Such a person is settting the stage for romance .  | A couple may buy new , expensive furniture ( props ) to signify a move to a higher-class setting . They may also develop and learn new lines . If overplayed , or if others do not accept the desired move upward on the social scale , they may be accused of " putting on airs , " meaning saying higher-class lines and playing higher-class acts that are perceived to be undeserved or that are perceived as inappropriate or pompous by the audience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a production " of their new status . They are " putting on too much of a show . " They are putting on too much of a " big act . " They are overdoing it and thus are bringing to the foreground their attempts at playing a good show . A good theater performer plays the act in such a way that everyone forgets it is a theater production . The newly rich , medical interns , new graduate students , boys on first dates , and others sometimes try so hard to say the correct lines , and to create the proper scenes , fixing proper settings , that everyone becomes embarrassingly aware of their lack of practice and their newness in the role . In time , if successful in their new lines , they may get into the act in a less forced manner . Although they are still acting and putting on a show as we all do , they are then not " putting on airs , " and people , as in the theater , can enter into the act , immersing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater production . The act is there but it is so smooth that a " production is not made of it . " When people go to the theater they know they are there , but enjoy themselves the most when they forget it is a play-act and become one with the show . We know people are playing roles in real life but we do not like to think about this . When people make it too obvious by overplaying we can not easily enter their acts and we lose the pleasure of associating with them . The dramaturgical analyst , unlike the public at large , keeps to the foreground of mind that people are in theater productions whether overplayed or not , and searches out ? researches ? all aspects of each person 's and group 's drama . Many lines , appropriate for various scenes , make a script . Scripts , scenes , and settings help define roles and make up the act of life . The lines that are appropriate for childhood and for same-sex acts and scenes are not always appropriate on the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same with many other life stages . Do you use the same lines in adulthood that you used in childhood ? Do you know anyone who does ? What are the consequences of using certain  | lines memorized for certain scenes in other , inappropriate scenes ? Bad show ? Are the lines and scripts of the football field and stadium appropriate for the educational scene and book setting of the school library ? Are other roles required ? Are the roles played on stage with mother appropriate for interactions with a wife in a new stage of life called marriage ? Do you understand why people have trouble when they play the wrong act in the wrong scene even though they do well in another setting and scene , playing the same act ? A successful businessman may play business profit-loss , competitive , aggressive , superordinate roles at work where , given the scene and setting , he may be successful , at least in amassing wealth . He plays the same act , so successful at work , in the home ? in bedroom and kitchen scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and plays the same roles , but does not know why he fails to receive applause at home when he does receive applause at work . He begins to play the role of blaming his wife . Little does he realize that his role at work is inappropriate in private scenes with his wife . He is producing and directing a bad show at home . He does not know that he should expand his repertoire . His wife plays the role her mother did , that of not telling of her discontents . She needs to understand that she is not in the scene of her mother 's house anymore , nor in a setting of a generation back , nor limited to the traditional scripts for women common in her mother 's day . She blames her husband for not being able to read her mind to perceive her discontent , playing the same act her mother did with her ( mother 's ) husband . The consequence of such a life act is that of inadvertently changing a love story to the tragedy of an unhappy marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a happy ending but are writing scripts that will lead to a bad end . An opera star has a repertoire of many characters for many shows , sometimes in different languages . Appropriate behavior and scripts for the Carmen role are inappropriate for other roles . Costumes , carriage of self , facial and verbal expression , lines , script , and sometimes language are different . In modern life people also play many roles , on many stages , in many stages , for many scenes . These multiple roles must be learned , studied , rehearsed , and modified , as necessary , to create a good show . It was simpler in folk societies where people basically played very few roles and remained for the most part in the same settings and scenes all their lives . For  | example , a woman cared for her children , cooked , sewed , worked , prayed , and conversed with neighbors in the same kitchen . But we are not in the scenes and settings of folk society anymore . Some people can not bridge the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society and often play the wrong act or confuse several acts . An opera star carrying on as Carmen in Aida makes a fool of herself . She is a failure . So it also is with other actors and actresses on the many stages of modern life . Sometimes we play to different audiences at the same time . It is as true in life , as in the theater , that audiences are composed of people with different perceptions . A medical intern plays lines appropriate to his patient but at the same time is engaging in another show to the nurse who attracts him romantically . When his professor comes on the same scene he plays specially to him too . It is very difficult for actors and actresses to satisfy an audience with diverse needs and desires . It is especially difficult for me to lecture well when different people in the same audience are at different stages of personal knowledge and development . I would prefer ? but do not get ? a more homogeneous audience . Most people do not have homogeneous audiences . Playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of an audience of many different kinds of people , with diverse views about work , life , and supervision . What works for one angers another . It is difficult enough performing before an audience of the diverse general public . But I do not wish to make my act more difficult by the presence of administrators and friends in the audience when I perform as a public speaker . When I am onstage I have difficulty performing well for all at once . What works for me with people I know well in terms of role , script , lines , even voice inflection and cues , is inappropriate before another , more formal audience . I want only one formal audience when lecturing , without a mix of people who know me well informally . Friends know me too well from my backstage behavior to allow me to engage freely , without self-consciousness , in the frontstage act necessary to keep an audience interested . They " blow my cover " and make me nervous . An administrator also makes me nervous . He spoils my act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show when he is in the audience . When I try too hard I'overplay my lines and ruin the show . People who know me as shy , with feelings of inferiority , make me feel nervous and out of place when I lecture with strength ,  | firmness and outgoingness as part of my frontstage act to an audience . Of course , once acting this part I begin to feel it and forget ( really lose ) shyness and feelings of inferiority . While acting it I am it in the same way that good actors and actresses really enter the roles they play . They feel the role and become the role . This is why they act their roles so well . The act is so good because it becomes more than a theater role . The actor puts himself ? his real self ? into that role and acts so well that he is no longer acting but living the role . He is acting the act of the character , which becomes him , and is thus " becoming " to him . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences too , so I can be strong ? It is not a simple matter to forget scripts learned from childhood and lived for many years . But it can be done . I have done it , have succeeded , and must try again . The comic strip and movie Clark Kent is a meek , mild , and shy man . People react to him as such . Actually they re-act ( react to ) or act back , the role or act he puts on for them . But when he changes costumes he plays another role . He becomes the strong Superman he always was . I am a Clark Kent in many of my life activities and this is how people inter-act ( interact ) with me , in reaction to my role . But when I come upon stage and begin to lecture , I am Superman . I changed my costume from the frightened Clark Kent and I am then a Superman . I act fearless . I am fearless . And I fly high , bringing my audience up with me , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know that I was Clark Kent before the speech and will become Clark Kent after it . I learned how to be Superman during a speech . Why not with an administrator , a rude clerk , a beautiful woman ? It is a matter of changing roles , expanding them , getting a new repertoire , refusing to be type-cast or to type-cast myself . Try on ? in your mind ? some new role possibilities . Study shifting and even opposite behavior in the same people as they change for different acts . Observe and analyze the Clark Kent ? Superman syndrome among people . If a person is capable of being Superman and Clark Kent , can it be said that feelings of inferiority or shyness are total in that person , or are they only single dimensions of a multidimensional human ? If a person says she is shy , does n't she really mean that one dimension of her behavior shows shyness , but that she has many other dimensions such as strong , and fearless , and bold too , but only  | does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool , is it not also true that wisdom is another dimension , which is only left lying latent ? If someone calls you a fool why be so upset about it ? At worst he has perceived only one dimension of your self . You should know that you have many other dimensions , too . Pull another out and act it , showing that you are a fool and many positive possibilities too . Thus the person calling you a fool , or any other disparaging symbol , is quite correct . You are a fool . Why argue with him ? Your arguing over a symbol that applies to you in effect proves his point because such arguing is foolish . You need only to remember that you are a fool and wise . It is only that foolishness was being acted out at the moment the name-caller saw you , or that he perceived the act of fool in whatever role he thought you were playing . You know you have latent wisdom . Thus do not be upset at being called a fool . Just start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If people see you as wise that too is true and you smile with pride . But remember you are wise and a fool too . The foolishness can come out at any time , such as by feeling arrogant pride about being so wise . I lecture so well and so wisely . I am so wise . In a moment I forget my lines and am speechless . I have to ask the audience , " What was I saying ? " So suddenly I am a fool . I am wise and foolish . Remember the many dimensions in you and in all other people . There are broad possibilities for expanding individuals and groups to their greater potentials if this is understood and positive abilities are brought forward instead of being drowned by the more usual roles played by a repeated bad act . If you are shy , the shyness is not total . Pull the boldness out and act it . When you act it you are it ! If a person is acting bold , imposes on others , and does not act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold to the background and act out the tender and quiet parts . The roles should then be integrated so the person is sometimes bold , sometimes retiring , sometimes loud , sometimes soft , in a free-flowing act , in response to shifting conditions ? not all one or the other ? as a total life act . A person can even be tenderly bold , as by boldly stepping forth to tell a woman tenderly that she is exceptionally beautiful in body and person and that he hopes she will have a good day . Here two dimensions are integrated , not compartmentalized . Many times playing the act of strength , as with Superman , shows strength in the act-ion ( action ) or act-ivity ( activity ) and outcome . This is good if the scene is right . But playing the act from  | the heart , " by heart , " of a person who needs to weep , to be hugged , to be loved , to be tender , is necessary for fulfillment of self-needs too . Superman ( in the first film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He feels it but does not tell it . He does not ask for nurturing . He is too strong for this . He shows his love by turning the world upside down . He weeps when no one can see him . When he is onstage again , in front of an audience , in front of Lois , he is back to his smooth , strong role again . He does not say , " How close I came to losing you . How much you mean to me . Please hug me . " However , Clark Kent ? who also needs tender responses and nurturing from lovely Lois ? does not ask forcefully enough for precisely what he wants . He is too shy and frightened to ask for what he needs . He needs to play the act of strength he obviously has in him . He does not , and he too receives little . The strong must learn to accept their tender needs and to ask for their fulfillment . The weak must find their strength and act it . Neither of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kents , really fill their needs . Their one-sided roles keep them from meeting the many dimensional human needs they have . Add to your repertoire . Play strength where weak , and the script and behavior of strength may come from your heart , " by heart . " Through practice ( practice ) you learn the strong part that other people respond to , and you become the part , and tend to become strong , or anything else acted on , or practiced . Interact ( interact ) as strong and people will be inclined to react ( react ) your part of strong , thus setting exchanges , and activities ( activities ) , leading to networks or grooves of action of strong to strong , and breaking labels of weak . Learn to play other roles that are also you , such as the character who needs to weep , to be hugged , to be supported , or who needs to be honest . Bring forth the many multidimensional aspects of your full self and character development , and make this part of your real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allow others to play the many good parts they can . Let a woman , for example , act strong . Let a man cry when he feels he must instead of suppressing it , or letting tears flow only when no one can see him . The problem of Clark Kent and Superman ( and most other similar people ) is that although one and the same person they compartmentalize their lives to super or retiring in character , or any other characteristics , instead of mingling ? integrating ? their character structures so one flows from and with the other . They play one-sided , not integrated , multifaceted roles .  | I suggest , clinically , that it is possible , and sometimes beneficial , to choose roles and shift to new ones , how , when , and where one wishes . I am capable of being Superman on an academic stage . I tried out for this act , rehearsed it , and became successful . Why not in more private shows ? I learned the role of shy there . It is possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labels , to be discussed in the next chapter ) and have repeatedly been put into and have chosen certain roles and acts . But we have responsibility for breaking these type-castings and to show audiences we have other capabilities too . And we have responsibility for breaking our stereotyped , one-dimensional vision of other people and their potentialities . Lois Lane , madly in love with her Super Man whom she rarely sees , neglects poor Clark Kent , who is at her side more often . She does not realize that some X-ray vision on her part will bring out the superperson Clark really is , which only hides behind his mask of shy . Do try on roles ? but be careful . Do not impulsively rush into new roles . Check them out and think about them first . Few people buy the first coat or dress they see in a shop . They try on the garment first for fit , style , and check the price . They try on other garments and then choose . There have already been two children who , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings . They thought they could leap from building to building in a single bound . They could not . They should have tried obstacles on the school running track , trying out the role of athlete , testing limits , rather than mimicking the movie hero Superman . A Lois Lane might jump in a moment to a new role of a less repressed life . She might find herself subject to a beating in a back alley bar . Cautiously retaining old roles without trying new ones is life limiting . Jumping impulsively to overturn all the old , and jumping to all the new , without some care and checking for fit , is sometimes as dangerous as crossing a city street without watching for oncoming traffic . A doctor may use phony lines because he thinks they will help a patient . But there are many lines commonly used to " con " others ? making them " fall for the lines . " People who are conned by a " con artist , " who is really a good actor of phony lines , are fooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show begins , eliciting phony exchanges . Are you a " con artist " too ? When will the real you stand up and sing your own , real , true self-role ? Is the real you  | phony ? Try on the role of honest and see where it leads you . Study " con artists " in varied areas of life . They are very common . Sometimes they " con " themselves too . They fool themselves about who they are , the roles they play , and the acts they set , to which others react . The dramaturgical approach is an excellent way to make the behavior of " con artists " understandable . There is a cultural expectation of some phony lines in many settings . This is true in dating , commerce and between doctor and patient , to take only three examples . Where the physician says " you will be all right , " when he does not think so , he is playing a phony act on one level , which is part of his real act on another level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who plays husband trying to deceive the actress called wife , as part of the script , is using phony lines on the stage , which is part of his honest act to the theater audience . Confusing ? Think about it . So are similar conditions in life . When is a phony act helpful to others ? When not ? One asks , " Do you like my boyfriend ? " The other answers , " I think he is ugly . " But someone else answers , " He 's not so bad , " which may say he is not that good either . What lines should be used ? It does seem that there are too many phony lines in dating and salesmanship . These lead to bad endings . But what about the physician ? Some say he should always tell the truth . Others say he should tell " white lies " to help patients , especially if he feels they can not handle " bad news " about their illnesses . What about your use of phony lines ? Choosing scripts and saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor and actress , which we all share , is difficult in the theater and on the stage of real life . We are " on show . " It is trying , trying out , so often needing to choose roles and behavior appropriate to them , to rehearse , so often making mistakes , making fools of ourselves before so many audiences . Since we are all actors and actresses we must put in long hours of toil and trouble to play the character of " person . " The word person comes from persona . Persona in Latin means a " mask " for actors , still another theatrical complication . It is not simple to become a real self , the person masking the inner self , the self striving forth to become authentic through the mask of the actor up front . It is not simple playing the roles of person , which are the masks put on us and which we put on ourselves . These masks guide us , but they also constrain us in one-dimensional acts .  | Think about persons you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put on male masks , female masks , clown , angel , devil , baby , lover , and others . How do these people look , act , and feel to you in each of these masks ? Have you been seeing them only in one stereotyped mask to which you have been conditioned ? Can you perceive that a person close to you can be a clown , angel , and devil ? Are there people you know who have been masked stereotypically as devils and who play their self-roles through those masks ? Delinquents and school and family troublemakers may be such people . Suppose you put angel masks on them ? Suppose they put angel masks on themselves and played angelic roles ? Are they still devilish ? Study the masks people put on others and those that people wear in daily living . What are the consequences of wearing these masks ? Find masks in a toy shop , those masks sold for Halloween or costume parties . Or , make some from paper grocery bags . Put on a mask and act out the roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , quiet person ? Is this your personal mask , your persona , masking your deeper self , masking other dimensions of your self ? Try on the mask of the devil . Find an audience willing to participate in your new act . A wife , husband , or friend will do . Act the devil . Are n't you really the devil ? Do n't you really have the devil in you ? Does n't it really feel good being that real , formerly suppressed part of you , that devilish part ? Now that you have acted out the devil , which is now out of you , do n't you feel good ? You feel good because you are good , having acted out the devil in dramaturgical as well as in psychiatric terms . The devilish part was not repressed , or pressed in , lying latent to bother you within . You are no longer split from your real self , evidenced in smiling mouth and hateful eyes , calm face but twitching , nervous hands , angelic posture but tight , constricted voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The devil is out , here acted out in a nonharmful theater act . You can now be and feel good . Are you a devilish person ? Change your mask to angel . A good person , the human self wearing the mask of civilized human , divorced from animality , is taught not to jump , scratch , pound his chest and shout , even behind closed doors in private scenes . People suppress and forget their animality , their animal dimensions , and become tight , constricted , nervous , tense . The person , with the persona of human , hides the animal side of the real  | self . Buy a gorilla mask and do what a gorilla does . Make your mate a gorilla too by buying and using a second gorilla mask for him ( her ) . Use your imagination if you can not find a mask . Does n't it feel good acting out the part of animal ? Does n't it feel good being an animal with one another ? Try a lion . Move like one . Roar like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , animality and grace of a lion in you too which you have let escape from its hidden position under the human mask . This might sound silly , but the perception of silliness masks the deep meaning of getting in touch with and acting , in nonharmful ways , the many dimensions in you . Varied recent psychotherapies use similar means of breaking through the limited , masked roles people have had put upon them and which they put upon themselves . The changed mask lets another dimension of the self shine out . Each freed part of self removes another repression . One-dimensional people blossom into their multidimensional potentials . There are some people who do act like gorillas on public streets . They should try the mask of angel instead . We should not " behave like animals , " as some critics of problemlike behavior put it . I do not advise obnoxious public behavior . I only advise doing lion and tiger things periodically in play behind closed doors . It might however , lead to more graceful walking on city streets if a person periodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? walking through the jungle bush . Try it and check the results . There are people who think this is total nonsense , offensive , and even unworthy of a book of this type . I ask that you do not judge the advice without trying it first with an open mind . Animal gracefulness , strength , and sleekness can offend no one who is playfully in touch with himself and with the natural world . An animal dimension is part of all people , and where it is repressed , various tensions and limitations will result . If a gorilla is not to your liking , try a bird or a butterfly . Play-acting a lion , or tiger , if the person can " let go " and drop the human mask , can lead , to use only one example , clumsy people to be graceful . Those poor people who thought that they were just plain clumsy without potential for gracefulness might learn that they do have the ability for gracefulness . It just may be hidden by trying too much to be human . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person , masked by many years of repression . Let it out , and see the effects . If this frightens you because you are overcontrolled and fear what you  | might do in case you acted out animal parts , fearing that you will " lose control " of yourself , perhaps then it would be best that you just remain a repressed , one-dimensional human , until you can find a professional who can personally guide you through these exercises . Intimates especially can be advised to relate more multidimensionally to one another . It is difficult to achieve a true intimacy with a masked person , a shadow only of the real , multidimensional self , real multidimensionality hidden behind the mask of human ? male or female , or old or young . Varied forms of play , as in a play , can expand roles and can avoid exchange ruts . For example , groom one another as monkeys do . Nuzzle one another as horses do . Roar at one another and nibble at one another as lions do . Frolic with one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another as a tiger might . Use your hands as paws to scratch out a place in bed , or among pillows thrown on the floor . Turn round and round as an animal does , find your place , cuddle in , and then sleep the sleep of the animal you . These games are not childish . They are childlike , and bring out the playful dimensions of child and animal . But if you are incapable of being like a child , ask " why not " ? Why is that heaven closed to you ? Playing on various stages of life ? at home , work , school , and elsewhere ? yields good shows and poor ones . There are mistakes . The word mistake can be seen as miss-take , as in a movie filming , still another theater connection . There are many missed takes while filming a movie . These missed takes are made by the best actors and actresses . So when more common folk fumble their lines , forget scripts , use poor lines , or miss cues , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead film the take again . Give the actor or actress another chance at the take , to rectify the missed take . Put the miss-take in the garbage , not the actor or actress miss-taking . Why do we torture ourselves and others for miss-takes when even professional , famous , skilled actors and actresses with memorized lines miss takes too ? Let us join this company of actors and actresses who do takes over when there are missed takes . Let us use our energy , not on putting ourselves and others down , but on improving our acts instead . There are frontstage regions and backstage regions . Certain behavior is appropriate backstage , but not frontstage . An actress ' hair can be down , her costume may not be on right ? or at all ? in  | backstage places . Backstage in a dressing room she can wear old clothes , with face unwashed . Before she opens her door ( the stage curtain ) to the frontstage of the " behind the scenes " she fixes her hair , and dresses in the costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to the actual theater stage . The curtain opens , and she plays her act . It is the same in the theater of life . If the setting is a beach , a bikini swimsuit may be appropriate , but not underclothes , even though both may costume the same amount of body . Appropriate costuming for the scene is important . If some passing people accidentally saw a woman undressing behind a tree for the beach and saw her in her underclothes , she would probably be embarrassed , and so would they . If they saw her in her swimsuit bikini she would be undisturbed even though underclothes and bikini bathing suit cover an equal amount of body . Here it is not the amount of skin shown that is important in costuming , but the symbol called bathing suit contrasted to the symbol called underclothes . These symbols make one costume appropriate and another inappropriate . Symbols of things make the reality in social life . Underclothes are appropriate for backstage scenes such as dressing rooms , before the curtain goes up , as for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bathing suit is appropriate for the frontstage scene of the beach . But the bathing suit is not appropriate for the frontstage scene of an evening concert . A commercial airline pilot seen entering his plane in jeans would not feel or look right . The mechanic dressed in work jeans or jumper at the same plane is appropriately dressed and causes no concern . The pilot 's skill has nothing to do with what he wears . He maintains the ability to fly his plane in uniform or jeans . But he must wear the proper costume for the show at hand . He confuses and upsets the audience if he does not . He certainly does not need to wear his uniform when he goes fishing . People often make mistakes about costuming . They would not often debate underclothes versus swimsuit in beach scenes . But they do often wear the wrong costume on other stages of life . Sometimes they wear ? in their symbol meaning ? the correct attire , which is seen as inappropriate by other actresses , actors and audiences . Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public beaches , or at least to carve out a section of a public beach for the " nude scene . " They see every good in this frontstage act and  | lack of costuming . Other actors and audiences are infuriated by this act , which they see as appropriate only for backstage places , such as shower stalls ? with the curtains shut . This is very well described by Jack Douglas in his book , The Nude Beach . ' Walking shorts may be appropriate for a summer stroll in the park . If the curtain is to go up on a church scene , then other costumes are appropriate . Some European church officials are irked by tourists who visit their holy places in shorts ? a costume by their perception for the beach only . The tourists perceive their costumes as appropriate vacation attire . Their vacations include visits to tourist places called famous churches . Study costuming in varied life settings as a dimension of dramaturgical analysis . When the actor opens the door from his dressing room he leaves the backstage of his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cast . But he is backstage from the vantage point of the audience . Before the next curtain goes up ( to put him before the public ) he may laugh , practice his dance and smooth his costume . When this curtain goes up this backstage will become frontstage and his behavior will change for the full frontstage acts . In a restroom , with toilet door shut , a person is in a backstage post . When that person opens the door the curtain goes up and behavior changes . When she goes to the washstands and mirrors she is in a same sex frontstage called restroom , which is backstage considering the opposite sex as the audience . When she goes to the door of the restroom and opens it , she opens the curtain to a larger frontstage , as she joins her date who is waiting . Thus in dramaturgical analysis it is important to ask , " frontstage or backstage for what audience ? " Front- and backstage are symbols too , and shift on the same stage . A large theater has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be opened . The stage of life is also multicurtained . Doors and curtains are not the only symbols demarcating front from backstage in real life . Walls , fences , window shades , umbrellas , even newspapers , sunglasses , hand fans , or a bare hand can make a backstage from a frontstage . A bum sleeping on a park bench might cover his face with a newspaper . Here a newspaper is the symbol curtaining front from backstage . He has the need to put himself backstage but has no home so he has no walls , no curtain , nor a shade . He uses whatever he can find and covers his stage  | presence by covering his face with the newspaper . He gains the illusion of being backstage . He sleeps soundly with the idea that he is in a private scene . Many people in the park are angry at the bum for spoiling the pleasantness of their frontstage scene and for reminding them that the act of life includes homeless people . They prefer to have these unfortunates away from them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backstage behind dark glasses or " shades " ( curtains ) as some people call them . Some such people try to spare their eyes from the bright sun . Others use the sunglasses mainly as covers . They wish to see , but do not wish their eyes ? really windows into their self-feelings ? to be seen . Lovers sometimes use a tree to curtain their kissing from the passing public . People who pass tend to avert their eyes from whatever can still be seen , or they take a fast glance and return the eyes to the path , acting the same way they might if they accidentally saw someone partially clothed through an opening in a window curtain . Some people in the New York City subway open the New York Times to its full length and put it in front of their faces and bodies . They may be reading the paper , but they havr ) also arranged a type of backstage . Some people say " Psst , psst , " and call a friend over to tell a secret . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wall , and puts a hand over the part of the mouth facing the public . Then she talks into her friend 's ear . She has put her words backstage the same way a performer might in a theater show where the audience is brought into a secret the other performers are not supposed to share . The performer cups his hand on the side of the mouth , putting the other characters backstage for a moment , where they do not share his words . Children delight in the " peekaboo " game where they and their parents put themselves backstage by covering their eyes , then " coming out " again . Many years ago coy women used to put themselves backstage by covering their faces with fans , peeking out slyly or shyly . Some women wore hats with veils , which put their faces backstage . Station yourself at some door where the frontstage becomes backstage and backstage frontstage . Note the sharp change in behavior as people pass the door , the point of " curtain down " to " curtain up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while mingling with the audience in the terminal . Watch him , if you can , through the airport windows which face the cockpit win- dow of his plane . He often removes his jacket and loosens his tie when he is backstage from the passenger audience . But he is frontstage with his crew , leading to other forms of behavior . People prepare scenes and fix settings . For example people clean house before guests arrive . They costume themselves and check costumes before curtain time . Their backstages , the interiors of their houses , will soon become part of frontstage acts when the guests arrive . Watch people straighten their clothes , and props such as chairs , when guests knock on the door . Most people pause at the door and prepare a moment for the stage entry of the other supporting characters . They are stage managing the move from backto frontstage . We are often nervous in back or in front of a door waiting to open it , or to have it opened at a knock . The knock is the curtain time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervousness is a form of stage fright before the curtain goes up . We fidget , fixing hair , ties or dresses one last time . But when the door is opened it is curtain time . Backstage becomes frontstage . Visitors as well as hosts take deep breaths , change their facial expressions , move frontstage , step boldly into the next scene , and say , " Hi , how are you ? Good to see you ! " Show time . Curtain up . The show is on . We act accordingly . In real life the point where the curtain is up or down is often blurred , leading to difficulties of adjustment and behavior . Study behavior of people before rapidly shifting or multiple audiences , and where backstage abruptly , without warning , becomes frontstage . For example , see how fast heated lovers change posture , demeanor , lines , script , when a minister ( or professor ) enters the scene without knocking because he did not perceive that there was anyone there for whom to knock . All the actors and actresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fast . There is embarrassment when people 's acts are entered at the wrong time . People are flustered when they enter into a backstage where they do not belong . They shift into different roles within moments or they make a fast exit . Have you ever , in error , entered the restroom of the opposite sex ? You are breaking into a backstage that is " off limits " to you . The feeling of embarrassment is extreme . Shall I get undressed while the nurse is hovering about in the examining room , preparing for the physician 's entrance , in response to her line of " Get undressed and lie down on the examining table " ? She often helps by leaving the room promptly or by purposely turning her back . That is her act . A woman writes :  | I learned something about doctors when I was nineteen . One of them told me to " undress . " I whipped my dress and slip off over my head and was naked . He looked horrified . I felt bad . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not bad ! I just did what you told me to ! I thought doctors were used to bodies . " I went on feeling bad , ashamed . When I told friends about this incident , I left out that last part and made it a funny story , and that was phony she makes it into a new show . After that , I was more squeamish with doctors . I asked them precisely what they meant . Then I became a little squeamish myself . The whole . . . sequence would never have taken place if I had told the doctor what was going on in me . ' What did the doctor mean ? Perhaps she needed to follow his cues or if these were not forthcoming perhaps she should have asked for more stage prompting . She learned to do this in later visits to physicians . Ask for cues when your next move is in doubt . The doctor says , " Undress . " Ask , in such conditions , " Now ? " or anything else you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same in any other area of life . Perhaps the doctor expected her to turn her back and undress as if to make a backstage by not doing it in his full frontstage view . Perhaps he expected her to be wearing underclothes . Perhaps she and we should learn not to be so upset by missed takes . Perhaps the physician should learn how to handle nudity . Perhaps she reacted too rapidly . He might have expected her to give him a chance to turn around , or to busy himself with something else before she undressed , thereby putting her backstage . Her timing might have been " off . " When my dentist was stuffing cotton in my mouth he said , " Bite . " I did . He cried out in pain . I followed his cue exactly ? but mistimed my response . I did not give him a chance to take his fingers out of my mouth . Timing in the following of cues is important . I was too fast in action . But precise timing in giving cues is also important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his instructions . He must learn to take fingers out of his patient 's mouth first , and only then to say , " Bite . " Perhaps my swift bite taught him a lesson ! There is embarrassment when people mistime responses , lose their lines , are inappropriately costumed , or in some way or another upset the dramaturgical flow of events . Such poor acts are frequent in our society where we have to move to so many stages so rapidly , where what " goes " in one place does not " go " in others , where we often do not have a chance to rehearse with the cast of performers  | but go into the act cold . And yet we still try . When I go to the doctor I shower first and wear newer , not threadbare , underclothes . When I go to the shoestore I am careful to wear socks without holes in them . My backstage feet , costumed with shoes , soon will be in socks , on frontstage . They must put on a good show so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play up to people . Sometimes we purposely play to an audience where the act could go on without that audience . For example , a couple may have an argument in front of guests . They may do this on purpose . This is commonly called " making a scene . " This common language shows dramaturgical insight . They play a good part of the act before the audience , bringing their bickering frontstage . Each partner may try to find allies among members of the audience . Some people purposely keep their arguments away from audiences and keep them backstage . They do not " air their dirty linen in public . " By this they mean that they keep unpleasant things backstage and put on a good front to the public . A wife and husband may treat one another well in front of guests . When the last guest leaves and the curtain is down the partners may fall upon one another with a terrible argument . " Why did you flirt with my friend ? " " Why did n't you help me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by spilling the drink on the department head 's lap ? " Now ? finally backstage ? the husband and wife " let down their hair , " as one normally does backstage , and express feelings they were repressing when they were playing before an audience . The viciousness of some such arguments might be due to the many hours of strain of playing good , happy , loving roles before the audience , holding back negative emotions ? repressed little negatives which accumulate . These negatives are released full force when the curtain comes down and they are backstage to play the roles they have been suppressing all evening . We learn to play special roles on frontstage . There are wide differences in behavior between front and backstage . We often make choices ? even marital choices ? mainly on frontstage behavior of others , but when we are allowed to enter their backstages with them we see new patterns of behavior . We are often disillusioned . The " neat " frontstage show exhibited in dating behavior may camouflage a slovenly attitude toward housekeeping or food preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spect restaurant kitchens . Not infrequently they find gross violations of health and sanitary codes . This never could have been deduced only by a visit to the fine frontstage eating area . People often spend many hours preparing their bodies ( washing and combing the hair , shaving , perfuming ) and costuming to put on a good front on a date . It may be disconcerting to find that after marriage a person is not quite so neat and clean . This is why it is said that a good way to get to know people is by marrying them , rooming with them , or taking a long vacation trip with them . Frontstage behavior leads to certain perceptions of who a person is , how he behaves , whether one likes reacting his frontstage acts . But backstage behavior is kept secret from the public audience . After marriage , or after sharing an apartment , or on a long trip , backstage roles , character development , quirks , customs , and other aspects of a person 's self , his act , his re-action patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the fuller self of the person peeks out from under his frontstage costuming , role playing and masks . There are times when the frontstage behavior of a relatively model citizen covers opposite backstage behavior . President Nixon was found to have used some very nasty words in his backstage scenes . The tapes of his conversations prove this . The tapes found their way frontstage to the president 's discomfort and to the disillusionment of the nation . In another case an " honest citizen " prizewinner for public service on frontstage , was found to be the murderer of many young men , a perverted sex-killer in backstage , to the shock of the public , when his " cover was blown , " meaning when his frontstage act was penetrated to a deeper character development than when " on show . " Sometimes the opposite can also occur . A " heartless " nurse or teacher , playing this role publicly , eliciting negative reactions to this act , may be seen to " have heart , " and even to be a " bleeding heart " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person with a " heart of gold . " The public act may have been to maintain a front , as is said , or a cover , in order to elicit brave , not self-pitying reactions from patients by the nurse , or study and effort from students by the teacher . Spies make excellent examples of the careful management of front and backstages , role playing , hiding real self under a cover ( or undercover ) , and " blown covers . " The dramaturgical approach is  | especially good for the analysis of such cases . Many people who are not spies also " put on a front . " When such a person 's " cover is blown " his real self pops out , to his embarrassment . There are people who play the role of shy and inferior in public acts . The public sees them that way . Behind closed doors , as their lovers can attest , these persons may feel protected , at ease , and can react to love with openness , intensity , deep emotion , and with deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles front and backstage . Do not make assumptions about people only after seeing them in one act . Do not presume that the actor or actress you see on stage is only that character you see portrayed . There may be other life acts and roles played by that same person in a backstage position . This is known by the public which has an insatiable appetite for stories about actors and actresses in their private backstage scenes . For good sociological research the backstage as well as the frontstage must be observed . It is necessary to ask permission to enter some backstages to study behavior there . It is possible to observe a pilot 's behavior through the windows of the plane from the airport windows . But you can not enter the cockpit without permission . And it is forbidden to peep through a woman 's window to see what she is doing in preparation for bedtime . There are legal penalties to pay for what is called being a Peeping Tom , and the excuse of doing it for sociological study will not save you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . Orchestra conductors often allow members of the public access to rehearsals . A cook in a large restaurant may not mind being observed at work in the kitchen , if he is asked and if he gives permission . But he does mind when customers enter his backstage scene to complain about food . Such a person is likely to be unceremoniously chased out . Sometimes a person is already part of the backstage scene and makes observations while part of that scene . If an outsider is allowed backstage , this makes the behavior of the group somewhat frontstage because the observer is an audience . Behavior may change . People can be asked what they do backstage or what they observed someone else do . But we are dependent on their ability of recollection , and honesty . It is not impossible to gather good data on backstage behavior . There are various techniques used in such research . This is not the place to discuss these . But as observers of the social  | scene do watch people in backstage scenes open to you for fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not misuse what you learn about people when you observe them backstage . The male gynecologist is on a stage where he must play a very narrow balancing act . The balancing act is really to keep a very delicate moving equilibrium going throughout his examination . The staff 's costuming of medical uniforms and gloves , and the setting of sterile , technical , non- " home-like " props such as medical charts , white or light walls , examining table , help set the stage , cue the patient , and help elicit appropriate " cool " medical responses . Lay persons , even those accustomed to the patient 's nudity , are often excluded from the examination room . This demarcates stage and scene between that which might elicit feelings and behavior appropriate to intimate relations , and that which elicits technical medical reactions . Scripts by staff include the nonemotional use of technical terms referring to the genitals . The gynecologist may use the words , " the vagina , " rather than " your vagina . " This keeps the patient from feeling that her very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nonintimate person , who is actually working with a very intimate part of herself . He play acts , or pretends , acting " as if " there is only a technical procedure . Actually for him it becomes so . She is expected to play act the same act . Where she does not , the gynecologist and staff enter with stage management . The aim is to set a stage for depersonalization . The gynecologist desexualizes and depersonalizes the patient so she feels she is part of a technical performance , allowing him to touch and probe in very private places , without arousing her shame , embarrassment , anger , or sexual response . Where any of these arise he must balance with cues he gives , pushing the interaction into the realm of technical coolness again . He gives cues , stage prompts , sets the stage , all to keep the delicate balance he needs for his work . He often has to play two roles at once . He treats the patient as an object with his hands while treating her as a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react as he feels she must for a successful mutual performance . He cues her coolness of response . But there are many times when he must relax an overly tense patient for the sake of the examination . Then he may use relaxed cues and verbal exchanges , switching from cool to warm , humane  | cues . Should he go too far in this , or should it be interpreted in ways he does not wish , for the sake of his work he must promptly balance again with the technical cues of impersonality . Depersonalizing and desexualizing the patient means that she ? at least the part of her examined ? is really treated as an object . Treating people as objects arouses their ire . Yet too intimate a response in the gynecological examination would do the same . A push too far in any direction leads to imbalance and a bad show . It is a balancing act on a tightrope . The tightrope is the exchange system between patient and doctor . The physician and his staff thus work very hard at stage managing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . But they are also stage managing a very difficult act in a very difficult scene , in a backstage setting , where a woman 's backstage sex life and habits , bodily problems , and her own sex organs are temporarily brought frontstage before an audience of relative strangers . ' The perceived incompetence of this stage managing has led some women to complain about male gynecologists . Some have demanded that gynecologists write a new show . Some women have helped write a new show and have created new settings where they are the main characters and not props . They wish to act the role they perceive to be proper , not what a male technician perceives as proper . Women have organized women 's health centers where a new act is written into the medical script , and where women as performers and audience feel more at home with medical staff , procedures , and with themselves . It would make a fascinating study to compare props , scenes , lines , script , act , stage management in this more avant-garde theater , as contrasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gynecologist 's act is one example of how dramaturgical analysis helps a researcher grasp the flow of life which otherwise might be too rich for understanding . The terms of the theater , as expressed here , act as sensitizing agents and allow the researcher points of reference to better understand what is happening in the study scene . One stage management often used with both male and female patients in many medical settings is to drape them in gowns . A gown can be arranged to put all of the body backstage except the part examined which is frontstage . Most of the body stays behind the curtain and remains private . Only one part is subjected to the  | frontstage , public act . This is one reason why the costume of patient 's gown is part of so many medical procedures when for the technical needs of the examination total nakedness would do just as well . What does it matter if a person wears a gown or not ? The doctor knows what to do medically with or without the patient 's gown . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our society where nudity arouses shame and is so morally circumscribed . It helps the act to go on in a smooth , professional manner . A male physician who can perform an examination on a female patient quite well by himself frequently calls for a nurse anyway . He wants an audience . Touching a woman in very private places might lead to misunderstanding . The nurse as an audience is a type of supporting character . She helps decrease the intensity of the patient-doctor relationship . The nurse can be used as a buffer against possible later charges . The doctor adds another character to the cast . A dyad ( two-person group ) is made into a triad ( three-person group ) so the third party can side with the patient ( decreasing the maleness-femaleness tension ) , and with the physician ( buffering the male physician-female patient relationship ) . It is the same with a chaperone . Sometimes a woman in dating prefers to bring a friend along as a chaperone to buffer a script that she fears will be too amorous for her liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a triad is unstable and does not make a good act . For example , a mother-in-law who persists in taking sides in husband-wife affairs ruins the desired two-person act . It is the instability of many such three-person groups that has led to the common saying , " two is company but three is a crowd . " The third party can take sides and make coalitions . This is not good in many forms of marital relations , but is desired in male physicianfemale patient relations . It is necessary to know the act desired and to cast accordingly . Gynecologists , as with other men , even in dating , have had to learn new roles in exchange relations , in response to the new roles some women are playing . There are women who are taking on new scripts and changing others . A gynecologist who is incapable of reacting to the expressed , and changing desires of his patients , will not be applauded for his performance . Men , whether physicians , lovers , or husbands , who remain with the old male script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these new scripts  | and thus are suffering the ire of female exchange participants . Men have to learn that they are no longer major characters on stage . They have to learn to change their lines and lifeways in response to the new cues of the females on stage and in the audience . They must learn new roles , or they will pay with a poor show that has the bad ending of loneliness or other problems . But women have to teach and cue men to their new roles . Men have successfully memorized scripts , sometimes after much rehearsing . If new scripts are abruptly given for the role of male , then expect confused reactions and missed takes . Also , when changing roles in the middle of a well-rehearsed show , such as marriage entered with certain role expectations , and played with performances repeated for many years , do not expect the entire cast of husband and children to respond in a moment to a whole new act . Give the cast direction , prompting , and cues . Give them the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them encouragement and try the take again . There are many comparable analyses that can be made everywhere , using the framework of dramaturgical analysis . Try some for yourself . Analyze husband-wife , family , teacher-student , and clerkcustomer as only a few possibilities . Analyze behavior in backstage and frontstage places . Analyze your own life , using dramaturgical analysis . For better understanding of your own life , ask : Who and what are you ? Where do you want to go in life ? What roles are for you ? What life roles do you want to play ? What act is good for you and for others ? What acts are you best in ? How have you failed in life stages because of inappropriate timing , inappropriate lines , and behavior poorly acted out , or acted in inappropriate scenes and settings ? How many phony and how many " real you " acts do you have ? Why not eliminate some of the phony acts ? What are the consequences ? Do you have more than your share of accidents , sicknesses , failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of failure , thus setting the stage for it , so you can weep and play the role of " pity me , " " poor me " ? Why not play another role of careful person ? Why not prepare your acts and lines , so you can be successful , instead of forever rushing into unrehearsed situations you can not handle because of lack of preparation ? Do you rehearse too much and never improvise ? That too is a human loss . Sometimes it is necessary to let go and ad-lib . Some people can not say or do anything , even expressing love , without  | rehearsals and preparation for the exact lines . They wait for the " right " moment , for a cue , which often never comes because the partner is also waiting for the right moment to give the cue . Neither initiates action but waits only to re-act . They obviously play in a boring show . Or if the right moment comes , it catches them off guard and they do not act . They have been rehearsing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life passes them by . There is no real action or activity . Just rehearsing becomes life for these people . When the lines are finally said they are overrehearsed and come out flat and stilted . Expressions of feelings do not have to be rehearsed . They have to be honestly said from the feeling in the heart . Thus , as in all areas of life , it is a matter of balance ? here balance between preparation and spontaneity ? that makes for a good show of life . Find different audiences if your present audiences do not respond to your character or give you cues that lead you to mischief or to one-dimensionality . Do not type-cast others , and do not allow yourself to be type-cast . Play out the many good parts of your full character development . Are you playing to an audience that applauds only when you engage in foolhardy or delinquent acts ? Why not find an audience that will disapprove of these acts and approve others so you will be given positive cues and reinforcement for less painful acts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To whom and for whom are you playing ? Are you playing too much for others as an audience and ' not enough for yourself ? Are you playing too much for yourself and not enough for others ? What are the consequences ? Do you play to and for people who do not appreciate you for the good person you are ? Do you want to play a " crazy " act all your life ? Change your scripts , lines , acts , and audience to saner , more tender , loving , virtuous , honorable types . Are you always putting yourself in the background of your life act ? Set your place in the foreground . Ask someone for something you need . It is difficult . So is it difficult not meeting needs . There may be a refusal . Learn to play the act of acceptance of yourself even if others do not react the way you wish to your lines . But they may say " yes . " Now learn to say appropriate lines and to play appropriate roles . What will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . Say " I am very shy . I do n't know what lines to use on a date . But I do want to get along with you . " The other actor or actress has the right to respond favorably or not . Learn how to accept both of these reactions to your act .  | It has been said that life is a drama in which we wish one story but write and play another . Is n't it time that we started to play the acts of our higher dreams ? Is n't it time to change dreams to reality ? A playwright confronted with a show that does not work rewrites the script . You are the playwright to your own life . Why do you always let others write , produce , and direct your script and show ? It is good to react to someone 's sane cues . It is good to seek advice . But it is good to start writing your own sane , self-fulfilling scripts too . Write the script you wish . Take responsibility for your act and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for casting you in a role you do not like . Try out for roles you wish to play . Better yet , write your own show , choose your own cast , and take responsibility for the outcome . Stage your own production . Revise scripts as the stages of your life change . What was a " good show " at fifteen may be immature at twenty and gross at eighty . But playing the role of eighty that someone else wrote can also be dysfunctional . Add youth , but not immature youth , to your older age scripts . Try on a few unaccustomed roles for testing . Make missed takes . Film the take again . Choose the best of the takes . Discard the others . Study the lives of various people and groups in these terms and in light of this entire chapter . Instead of asking these questions only about yourself , ask them about other people . Use the dramaturgical perspective as a " handle " to bring order to and make sense of what is going on " out there " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rush of data that confronts them when they try to do such research , using the dramaturgical approach or other perspectives . What is important ? What not ? What should you observe ? What should you leave out ? When looking to the left , something happens on the right . Turn to the right , and something happens on the left ? sometimes behind too . To use some dramaturgical words here , it is like the show of a three-ring circus . So much is happening that it is not possible to experience or understand everything . There are ways to handle this . The various perspectives presented in this book allow the ordering and simplification of data so analyses , understandings and connections between pieces of data can be made . If it is a three-ring circus , make observations and analyses from the perspective of one of the three rings at one time . Then move to the second , and then to the third . Interview and observe clowns . Move to animal trainers , trapeze artists , ushers ,  | cleaners , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the various role players and roles , you flesh out the entire show . With this method you are not overwhelmed with a rush of data impossible for one person to handle at one time . In a family , research the role of father , mother , husband , and wife . The same person can play more than one role on the same stage . For example , a person can be both wife and mother in the family . Then integrate the different perspectives of life you perceive from the point of view of each actor , actress , and each role . The three-ring circus then becomes an integral unit . We are not interested in recording every word and action . Of course we will miss every word and action of all the actors and actresses when studying one role at a time . What we are interested in are the dynamics of the interrelationships between people . It is no accident that people call love unions and other communions of people " relationships . " We are interested in how the people relate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act . We are interested in the various perspectives of the performers and the audience . We are interested in props insofar as they set the stage for action of one kind rather than another , as with the gynecologist , which was discussed earlier . But we do not have to have a list or precise description of each and every act , prop , costume , or anything else . We are not interested in making lists of things , but in tracing the meaning and consequences of social action . So it does not matter if we miss something . Important life events have a tendency to repeat themselves in any case , so we have many opportunities to catch what might have been missed earlier . This is because of the exchange process discussed in an earlier chapter . People groove networks of action . The networks of action are based on repeated scripts , lines , settings . Once the network is established behavior tends to repeat along those tracks . If we miss an argument , chances are strong the same argument ? possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface again . Sociology is not mainly a descriptive science but an analytical one . It is not a particularizing or individualizing science but a generalizing one . ' Sociologists do not wish to gather lists of individual things , actions , or events , but wish to generalize these into patterns , to what those things , actions , or events mean for the people studied and for other groups . What one leader does at one moment in time is not the sociological point of interest . But the principle of leader- ship is of interest , as are patterns of leadership , and the effects of these patterns . If we get the picture that the leader is authoritarian it is sufficient . We can trace the processes and consequences of authoritarian leadership . We do not need each and every case of authoritarianism . The sociologist does not have to describe everything . But he does want to analyze configurations of action . It is not necessary to put all the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle together to know what the picture is . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern is seen ( the grooved networks ) we " get the picture . " It is of interest to the puzzle enthusiast to put all the pieces together . But why should the researcher waste time and effort with all the little pieces ? Of what use is it to know that the sail of the boat in the picture is white or blue or that the wind is blowing it from left or right ? It is enough to know that the picture is one of a boat in a harbor . It is not necessary for this researcher to put all the puzzle pieces together if he has already determined what the picture is . A detective does not waste time looking for more clues once he has enough to know who the culprit is and enough evidence to allow conviction in court . Sometimes it is important for the sociological researcher to know if something is of one color or another . For example , it is important for the sociological researcher to know if a gynecological examining room is painted a sterile white , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is important to record whether a baby is covered by a pink or a blue blanket in a nursery . It is a matter of the researcher 's skill and art to know what to look for in the three-ring circus so patterns can be seen without being overwhelmed with the rest of all the bits and pieces of the data . Still another way to handle the problem of the richness of the show of life in dramaturgical analysis , or using any of the other perspectives , is to use a frame by frame analysis . The dramaturgical show of life , symbols and interactions , exchanges , conflict , and the other perspectives in this book , all can be seen as a framework . Frameworks are many frames that are tied together to give structure to any system , such as a building . If the building as a unit is too complex to understand , study it frame by frame . A building remains in one place . But the moving equilibrium of social life moves and does not stand still for our research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of life and rapidly drop the idea of studying or researching the ongoing  | show of life . This is one reason it is so rare that people ever submit even their own social relations to close scrutiny for better understanding . It is just too confusing . It is easier to credit or blame one person or event than to try to understand complex patterns of interaction . At best , many sociology graduate students collect some numbers about who does what and how many times as a method of making the system stand still so it can be studied . But in reality , as well as dramaturgically speaking , life is like a movie ? a moving picture that does not stand still . Or does it ? A moving picture is made up of thousands of separate frames of action . When all are put together at a set speed our eyes do not see the separate frames , but we see a moving picture , or movies . Sociological researchers have to reverse the procedure . It is necessary to stop the camera of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then study another frame , and another . In the movies , as in life , scenes shift . A person goes to work from home . Study the home frames , the travel to work frames , the work frames , the backstage and frontstage frames , the transition frames from one to the other . When you make sense of what is happening in these frames ( the how and why ) then run them together for a " running account " to see what happens in the moving equilibrium , in the moving pictures as in the movies , which portray slices of life . It is not wise to study all frames of action ( as with the example of the three-ring circus ) because the movie will be too long and complex to understand and watch . So choose those frames in which you are most interested . The frames of home and work are meant only as examples . It is quite acceptable to decide only to study the frames that make the movie of life at home or work , or in prison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perspective of one or another character . A movie does not try to show you everything about the characters and plot . The producer arranges a focus on one part of life and on certain characters and skips over others . The sociological researcher and analyst does the same . Run the show you are observing , in your mind , in slow motion in order to perceive the moving equilibrium . In other words , make the action slower than it occurs in reality , as is done in slow-motion moving pictures . Now study each frame , as it connects to the others , but more slowly than real life , so you can better grasp understandings of what is happening . Can you see actions , reactions , consequences , exchanges , balances , imbalances ? If not slow the show  | down some more . Bring the picture back to normal speed . Have you gained the skill to perceive the actions and reactions at the speed they occur ? If not , slow the movie down again . Bring the show to the past ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . What are the connections ? Connect the past and present to the future . What are the connections ? What do you see ? What do you forecast ? What can be done about it ? Ask some of the other questions asked in this chapter . Given certain role paying now , what could be predicted for the future ? Happiness ? A bad ending ? Jail ? Success ? At what cost ? Develop acts for frames that bring the story to other endings . Write a script . You are producing a film of life in your mind . If you are writing about your life , you can write , then act the new parts that will bring you where you want to go . Aside from the clinical self-help involved in projecting on a mind-screen future frames of action predicted on past and current frames of action or inaction or reaction , and writing new scripts for better present and future scripts , this technique can be used for sociological research and analysis . If you observe that husband acts toward wife today as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you predict ( given the absence of altering conditions such as insight , and changed behavior ) for the future ? If the prediction is a bad show , he can be advised to write another script . Connections between childhood experiences and role playing at work , in marriage , or elsewhere , and the consequences , can be studied . It is possible to make predictions based on past events . Then when the future comes you have those new frames of action that you can stop to analyze . Such frames become data ? the evidence ? to test any hypotheses that you set up when studying the past frames . When you study past and present frames you can make hypotheses about consequences of such actions . When the future comes you can test those hypotheses . When you test a sufficient number of such hypotheses then theories about human behavior can be developed . These theories also order life for research and understanding and provide research and analytical handles . Such theories become frameworks for further testing and research , and refinement , all the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . It is your movie . You can do with it what you wish . You may , for example , visit a prison and ask inmates who are presently there , here , now , " What in the past led you here ? " You can also ask their p 165 counsellors or family members , and trace their perspectives on the connections . You can ask the police . You can compare the frames provided by different participants . Are there differences ? Why ? What are the consequences ? You can develop hypotheses about human behavior for further testing . Theories of human behavior are developed with the testing , to be further tested , refined , and to be used to better understand people , as well as clinically to help people . A frame by frame analysis can certainly be made with the dramaturgical perspective and it is especially appropriate because of the fit of drama with movies that are made up of frames . But a frame by frame analysis can be made while using other perspectives too . Using the exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on exchanges , eliciting frames of action based on exchanges . If conflict is our camera focus , then we take pictures of conflict and put exchanges more to the background . If structure and function ( Chapter Seven ) are our interests then our camera can be focused on perspectives from different parts of the structure , such as from roof down or from basement up . The social structure also has within it roof and basement , that is top and bottom , higher classes and lower , higher and lower positions , even in the family , and perceptions based on these positions . Each perception from each position is a frame . Each frame gives a different picture of life from different perspectives , or said other ways , from different angles or vantage points . We have scientific data from many perspectives . Now run the many perspectives , the roles , the actors , actresses , and everything else , into a moving equilibrium again . The movie of real life , with many characters in multidimensional , free-flowing action , pops out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various real-life shows and social scenes of daily living , including the case in the Appendix , by using the dramaturgical perspective . Ask and search for ( research ) the answers to these and related questions . Who are the actors and actresses ( the cast ) ? Who are the main characters ? Supporting characters ?

What happens when different actors and actresses on the same stage hold different symbols of the same play , or of the same issue ? Try it with the cast of mother , father , daughter , son , all on the same stage with different lines , cues , and symbols . Think of other questions of your own , using the words of the theater as a " handle " for analysis . Pretend that you are a play- wright . Said another way , in sociological and dramaturgical terminology , role play a playwright . Now write out shows and scripts and scenes . Refine them . Change them . Do this for varied life settings and stages in which you are part . Do you see life possibilities and possibilities for change that you did not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , act out in your mind how other actors and actresses feel and think . You should now understand them better . React to cues , perceptions , symbols , as others see , feel , and need them . Do you want to change your acts to meet the needs of others now that you have role played their roles by temporarily taking their roles ? Do you want to retain your old acts ? No matter what you want to do with your own roles and acts , do you understand why others act and react as they do ? You should . If not , ask them questions and continue to role play until you do understand . Write out a show for your future , your life , your relationships with others , with the opposite sex , with parents , and with friends . Play out the show in your mind . What are the consequences ? Do you like the show ? Be your own critic . Change the show , in your mind , to meet your criticisms . Now go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you feel ? What is the outcome ? Change what did not work . Try again .  | LABELS are symbols put or stuck on oneself , someone , or something . Symbols come from interaction and lead to interaction , and are part of interaction ( symbolic interaction ) . Interactions are exchanges . Symbols make exchanges and are part of exchanges . They are part of exchange processes . When exchanges are repeated , they become structured and help to make social organization . Exchanges , interactions , symbols , become part of the act , part of the drama of social life . They lead people to play the roles of the label put into the interactions and exchanges . Thus labels have a tendency to fulfill themselves , whether " right " or not , " real " or not . ( Note how all the perspectives discussed interrelate . ) The reason labels tend to fulfill themselves is that when labels are pinned on someone the person doing the labelling plays a role toward that person based on the label . He engages in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show that tends to lead the person labelled to react , to re-act that role , reacting to those cues given . Certain scripts are memorized and become a part of a person 's repertoire of life roles . This memorized re-act-ion ( reaction ) to the script proposed by the labeller and to the label shows how labels tend to fulfill themselves . The script pinned to a person tends to be acted out , and re-acted , in reaction , thus becoming part of the real world , whether the label itself at first is real or true or not , by whatever measure is used . Thus it is of crucial life importance to take especial care with labels . They are very powerful . An actress who is labelled a comedienne is hired as one and is repeatedly given comedy scripts to memorize and comedy roles to  | play by theater and film producers . She does not have the chance to play other roles , and to act , and re-act to other parts . Her repertoire is limited to that of comedy . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that role . But is it another truth that she has abilities to play other roles lying latent in her , unused ? We do not know unless we give her a chance to try out for other roles , and unless she gives herself the chance to make the trial . Various social , religious , racial , age , sex , physically handicapped , and other groups in the same manner have been given limited roles which they play , such as in lower positions at work . Their limitations are often proven true . Data may show that these people do hold lower ranking social positions . But other roles have not always been given to them to try out . Thus we see " truth " when we look at their social attainments , but only a partial truth . Do they have abilities lying latent that may come forth if they are allowed to try out for other roles ? Would the results show another side of reality , of truth , in resultant outcome , if more and other opportunities were given ? Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and democratic manner . We can not say that a drug will not cure a disease if we never test it . It is of course true that the drug did not ever cure the disease . But another dimension to this truth is that a test was never made . Thus we do not know but can only surmise about what might happen if a test is made . We must try a test and note the results . We must make the same trials in social life as is done in medical research before permanently labelling . A person labelled inferior , bad , or delinquent tends to act and react that role pinned on him . The role becomes memorized and a habit , as that person acts and re-acts that role pinned on him , exchanging in the interactive system channelled by others . When " bad " he proves the label , leading others to the tendency to re-act to him that way , to which he re-acts . He is stuck with a limited , one-sided script . The exchanges based on the label become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now lead a person right down the track of action which time and again proves the label . Psychotherapists and other counsellors ? sometimes a lover who sees other role possibilities in the person ? refuse to re-act to or give cues toward negative labels pinned on a person . They refuse to re-act to negative or low labels a person even pins on himself . They attempt to set other re-actions that break negative labels and re- sultant life-constraining effects . This is why counsellors and lovers sometimes seem to have such positive effects on a person formerly labelled and acting negative roles . EXAMPLE : A student comes to class with the idea ( symbol ) and label ( symbol ) that his teacher is an enemy . The student 's enmity is shown by the hate in his eyes , his sullen attitude , disrespect , and attempts to provoke a loss of temper by the teacher . The student holds a negative symbol which he pins as a label on his teacher . The student accordingly acts or plays an act based on it . The teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the student 's label , as cued by the student . The teacher feels resentful and angry in return . What is the student angry about ? The teacher feels that he never did him any harm . The teacher thinks , justifiably , that the student is unfair , and unjustifiably but understandably that he is " no good . " These are the teacher 's labels . The teacher shows these labels by acting them toward the student . The student then re-acts to the labels " unfair " and " no good . " The student now has proof that the teacher is an enemy who dislikes him . The student is correct . The teacher does not like him and shows it . Note the interactions . Note the exchanges of negatives that become part of the structure of their relationship . They are in a bad scene . There is a bad show going on . The student may not be a bad person . The teacher may not be a bad person . But the mutual labels pinned on each other are cuing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a scene of unresolved conflict , off any real specified issue , beyond the participants ' understanding of what is really happening . Had the student smiled a jolly good morning the teacher may have reacted in a jolly way . This is the way labels tend to prove themselves . Treat a child , an ethnic group , or anyone by a preset label , and there is a tendency for the person or group labelled to fulfill that label . Now the person doing the labelling says " I always thought so . " And , " How right I was . " When certain people are labelled as low-level , then attention may not be given to their education , or to their problems , or needs . The end result may be that they are low-level in the class structure , educationally and economically . They may feel bad and so act too , reciprocating the mistreatment they perceive they received . Thus they may be seen to be low-level . This is an example of what is known as the self-fulfilling prophecy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or yourself , and you may tend to act in such a way that you set conditions that help to fulfill the prophecy . Without thinking about your role in doing things in line with your prophecy ( or expectations ) you do them anyway , making the end result come true as a result of your actions . Think positively about the possibility of scholarly behavior , for example , and you may feel the need to act like a scholar and you may end up one , fulfilling the first feeling or prophecy . In other words , give yourself the label of scholar and act that label . You may turn out to be more of a scholar than you thought possible . Think of yourself as an incompetent ( " I will never be able to pass that examination " ) and you have no motivation to study , so you do not study , and you may fail the examination , having fulfilled the prophecy . Think " I will pass that examination " and then you will into existence motivation to study and the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to pass the examination . You yourself set the appropriate conditions , by the symbols in your own mind , which lead to the positive act , or lack of it . Thus you tend to prove the prophetic thought . Suppose you label yourself a scholar , and your attempt at scholarship does not meet with success . Remember , a label is only a symbol . A symbol has life and power only insofar as people give the symbol the life and power . A symbol is nonexistent until a person conjures up its existence . You have set your label . You gave it life and did a " take " with that label , but made a miss-take ( mistake ) . Try another symbol on for size . How about carpenter ? Mechanic ? See if you have more abilities in these directions than in scholarship . If you label yourself a scholar , and do what scholars do , you may tend to succeed in scholarship if you have the ability . But if the results prove that you do not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do , you have given life to that symbol " unworthy , " and unless it is dispensed with the trash , it will make you suffer . Since you gave the label " unworthy " life , in actuality you make yourself suffer . In other words , you are the cause of your own suffering . You may correctly label yourself , after the missed take in scholarship , as an incompetent scholar , but why do you label yourself an unworthy person ? What has competence in scholarship to do with inherent human worth ? The answer is nothing at all , unless you make the connection , conjure up the label " unworthy " and wear it .  | You gave yourself the label " scholar " and gave the symbol " scholar " life and power . You can in the same manner kill that symbol 's life and power and try carpenter instead . But it has power over you if you hang on to that symbol and can not let go of it . " I am a failure as a scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " I tried the role of scholar and honestly failed in that act . Now let me bury that role and try another . I am a worthy person looking for a role to meet my abilities . " The thought , " she , he , or groups such as blacks or whites will treat us in a bad way " leads people to act coldly or poorly to them , which may lead those labelled to react accordingly , proving the label . Understanding this self-fulfilling prophecy leads to the understanding of many social processes and our roles in them . This knowledge provides the ability to solve personal and social problems . Think positively . Label positively . Act positively . Positive results tend to follow . These understandings taught to many people should yield a better society . But avoid negative labels when positives do not follow from your positive symbols , and study why the positives did not come . Then make necessary exchanges , again trying to bring out the positive . Labels do not always bring forth their fulfillment . They only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that we are speaking of tendencies . People have limits to their abilities . It is possible that a label is pressing someone beyond his limits . Thus he can not re-act that label . Some people have severe psychological blockages . What they hear is not always what is said . Label one thing and they hear something else and react to that something else . Or there may be misinterpretations . A man may compliment a woman by telling her he thinks she is beautiful and she may see his positive label as a negative ? perhaps " men are always trying to use me . " She responds in an ugly manner and does not fulfill his positive label of beautiful because she interprets his positive label in a negative light . Some people refuse to be bound to another 's act and refuse to react . For example , in response to a negative label they adopt an act of " I know that I am better than that . " Or , " That is her opinion , not mine . " Or , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that way toward me ? " This last question leads to questions of the other and the opportunity for exchanges of information and symbols . Then they can negotiate and hopefully resolve and remove negative symbolings . Thus people do not have to fulfill the labels stuck on them . They can press the acts to other exchanges .  | People who do not misinterpret and who are not blocked can react well to positive labels . When they act positively they show that positive labels tend to fulfill themselves . People who hear a negative label and think through whether they have indeed provoked it and whether it is based on reality , and if so change their behavior , turn a negative to a positive . If the label does not fit reality then they forgive the labeller and explain his misinterpretations of their behavior to him . Such people prove that whereas labels have a tendency to prove themselves , this is not an absolute . There are not many people who behave this way . People commonly react to a negative label in a foul manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of negative labels tending to fulfill themselves . People who do not act negatively when a negative label is pinned on them have freedom . They write their own scripts . They choose whom to react to , whose symbols to re-act , what scripts to react to , and how to react to them , and which people , symbols , and scripts to avoid . They are the power over their own minds . They take responsibility for their actions and reactions . They respond , by accepting or rejecting , responsively , responsibly , the roles laid out for them by others . They choose . They take responsibility for reacting or not re-acting . They do not wait for others to label positively in order to re-act that positively . They act positively on their own choice . When others label them positively they choose which positive to re-act back . If a student tells a teacher , " I think you are a wonderful person , " the free teacher reacts positively but chooses which positive to bring forward . He may respond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elicit such good , feelings from you . I think you are a good person too . " And he gives the student a failing grade for the course because he must from conscience and because the student is better off knowing his weaknesses than being lied to throughout his schooling . He does not give a passing grade because the student pinned a positive label on him . One reason some people prefer not to praise is for fear that the other will think that there is " apple polishing " going on . A person praised can re-act that praise with " thank-you " and does not have to give a high grade or anything else back , if conditions do not merit such giving . The unfree person thinks he has to react to praise by giving what he thinks the other wants . Such people prefer not to hear  | praise or compliments . They want to be free of exchange obligations coming from that praise . Such feelings have led many people to avoid giving or accepting positive acts and labels . They keep themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free person can give the positives he chooses . He reacts to positives with whatever positive he wishes . Free people do not even wait for a positive label to act positively . They do so on their own volition . They are the leaders in positive acts . They do not sit around waiting for others to do good or to provide positive labels to which then they react as followers . They act first . They do not wait for other people to say " hello , " to which they would be happy to answer . If these others do not say " hello " unfree people are angry at their unfriendliness . The free person says " hello " first and often gets greetings in return , proving people are indeed friendly , at least in greetings . Where negative comes from the positive , they forgive . Free people do not blame others for leading them into painful scripts by negative labels or by setting negative role expectations toward which they react . They realize that they themselves were responsible for re-acting the negative expectations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The person setting a negative label is responsible for that . The person following the label is responsible for that . Free people listen to what people have to say . They think about other people 's advice , symbols , feelings . And they responsibly respond , choosing to live autonomously , sometimes accepting and sometimes rejecting , on their own responsibility , the scripts laid out by others . Since they have chosen they freely take responsibility for any problems that may occur because of their own mistakes . They are not dull-headed in their refusal or inability to respond to the feedback or advice of others , but they do not blindly follow the scripts and roles laid out by others either . But many other people only react to labels . This is common . These people are not free since they are bound up in someone else 's act . They are really slaves to the acts set up by others . Slaves tend to hate their masters because the masters make them do what they might not have chosen to do if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of their freedom . This is why unfree people who slavishly follow someone else 's label blame and hate so much . They have abdicated  | responsibility for choosing and being who they really are or may yet be , and they project ( or pin ) their resultant unhappiness on someone else . " It was their ' fault that I am unhappy . " A college student who would rather be a blue-collar carpenter may blame and hate his parents because he thinks they force him to go to school . He may hate his college because he thinks he is forced to take classes he does not like . He may blame his teachers because he thinks they steal his freedom by forcing him to study and attend classes . But no one forces him to do any of these things . He has freely chosen the role of student instead of carpenter . He has freely chosen his father 's label of scholar rather than his own of carpenter . He re-acted to his mother 's expectations and is responsible for that . His blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life act . I have some students in my university classes who at one time or another sit there with what looks to me like hate-filled eyes . They are angry and hateful because I assign three-quarters of one simple book to read in one threecredit course . It is too much for them . They hate me because I tell them to attend lectures . They hate me because I give and grade examinations . They hate me because I tell them that reading and writing abilities are necessary in my classes . They hate me because I teach them things they do not like to learn . But what is expected of a student in a university class if not to read a book , listen to lectures , read and write , learn new things , and take examinations ? And what is the use of the course credits without attendance , reading , study , learning new things ? If all requirements were dropped these people would still suffer negative feelings . Such students were angry and hateful when I assigned two books to read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one book to read . The anger and hate are in them and they do not derive from university requirements . Those who see problems in the university and who do not feel they are learning much ask for more reading . They choose more stimulating courses . They write papers on their own volition and ask professors to review them helpfully . They participate in class discussion to make the class interesting . They positively demand better performance from their teachers . They work in many ways to improve the school system , thereby turning negative experiences into personally and societally rewarding ones . They do not waste their energies by negative emotions . They take responsibility for their actions , feelings , and for improving what they do not like . These students are rare .  | This tendency of putting responsibility on someone else for one 's own feelings , actions , problems , is called projection . A projection is a label someone has about himself , or in himself , which he pastes or pins on another , tricking himself into thinking he is free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The person projects his own trouble on another person , or on something else , such as school , and pins his own negative label there . He feels negative emotion which he projects outward at the person or object he feels caused his problem . Little do such people realize that they hate themselves . Little do they realize that since they have little control over the others , and since the problem is not in those others but in themselves , that they have lost their freedom of action . They go through their years of school , marriage , work , and lives , putting their problems on others . They never change themselves and waste their whole lives bothering other people who are seen to be the causes of their problems . This is an extremely common process and it is grossly disruptive of good human relationships . There are many people who believe that they are responsible for personal successes gained but are not responsible for failures . Students commonly hold this feeling . An " A " is the result of superior achievements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examinations , unfairness of the teacher , teacher bias , and special conditions on the part of the student such as poor school background , illness , too much outside work , too many examinations on the same day , and many more reasons , all projected outside of the student . These excuses are used to demand extra points on examinations to bring the low grades higher . Why not just take responsibility for the low grades and study harder ? And if indeed there is proven bias , why complain about that when that same student will not complain about bias in his favor , errors in his favor , and those grossly inflated grades which he knows he did not deserve ? If one complains about unfairness represented by lower grades , why not ask for lower grades when higher are given which are not deserved ? Irresponsible , projected hate and blame making are common in the family , in heterosexual relations , at work , in school , and in politics . This is not a matter for moralistic comment . The problem is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in statements in the mass media , in arguments between lovers , in schools , at work , in race relations , in international relations . It  | can be seen in most breakdowns of good interhuman relations . It can partially be inferred from the kinds of problems that people have with one another . Eliminating projections would eliminate the cause of many unnecessary problems between people . Eliminating projections is extremely difficult because the person projecting is blind to reality and sees only what he wants to see . A person who projects his problems on someone else may study these words and learn them well . He may become an expert in finding projections engaged in by others . Such a person can research and find projections engaged in by the opposite sex , teachers , government officials , racial minorities , or even majorities . But such a person may tend to remain blind to the fact that he is projecting the ability to project only on everyone else . He does not see that he has this perceptual block . Such a student might perfectly answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few points are taken from a question he answered imperfectly , bringing his grade to a " B " from an " A , " he can not accept that he is less than perfect . His teacher suddenly is seen as imperfect and he accuses . The cure rate for this problem is low . The people projecting confuse themselves ( and often others too ) with their word and mind games . Those who suffer the problem of projection are caught up in their own labels . They think they are combatting others , but they will never win because the enemy is in their own selves . Just reading these paragraphs is not enough . Knowing about these processes and extricating oneself from them are not the same . Clinically , it is not enough to know about cures ; one has to effect cures by engaging in them , bitter medicine notwithstanding . I suggest that those with bad feelings about others ask why they prefer to feel bad about those others rather than seeing them as good ? or understanding them . If a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset rather than preferring to see your errors . Thank your teacher for pointing out your errors , to your benefit for self-improvement . If these lines upset you and you hate me for writing them , ask why it is that you are upset and why you see the fault in me . The fault is in you . Thank me for pointing out a problem of your life and feel good about me . If you think my analysis is wrong , then write proofs and articles , without hate , showing that your research proves me wrong . There is no need to see badness in me unless you prefer to see me this way . The badness seen in me may well be due to the fact that the words fit you very well and you hurt because of it ; so you  | project your hurt instead of taking responsibility for the ways of life which made you hurt when you read my words . Whatever you think about me , for your improvement think through your bad feelings for other people in the same terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This may or may not be true . But while waiting for " them " to change , what are you doing to improve things you do not like ? And what is your role in " their " behavior ? Trace the exchange processes and remember that you are part of the balance . If it is a sick balance you share some of the responsibility . And why are you always waiting for " them " to change ? Why do n't you change ? The " system " may pressure us in inhumane ways . But it is no use always blaming and hating the " system . " Social systems of any type , such as schools , corporations , or even marriages do not exist without people and have no life without the actions of people in them . Like it or not you are part of the " system , " part of the exchange relations in it . While wishing and waiting and fighting for the " system " to change , I suggest that you do . The " system " already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are part of it . Suppose , some parents ask , a young seventeen-year old does not know his mind and chooses carpentry , only to find that he should have gone to college . That was his choice . That was his response to life . He made the choice on his own responsibility , and has no cause to blame anyone , especially when he was freely advised otherwise . Nor should parents blame him or themselves . He made a miss-take . Now let him respond , responsively , responsibily , to that missed take and to what he learned from it . And then let him film the take again . Life is not risk-free , nor is human life error-free . His mistakes are growing experiences , if he allows them to help him to develop . There are many colleges eager for students . Eager is not the correct symbol for some of these colleges . They are in fact desperate . They would be glad to have this dropout from the work world . There are day and night sessions , television courses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can rectify his missed take on his own responsibility . He will only become " famous " three years later . No one forces you to react to a negative label put on you . It is a common reaction but it is not a forced reaction . Why do you choose to react to sick and mean people 's labels of you as inferior , ugly , incompetent ? Why not live your own act ? " I am worthy . His symbol is his , not mine . Let him wear it , but I choose my own  | fashion , after my fashion . " It is not pleasant being labelled in a negative manner . But each individual has the power , or should learn to have the power not to react to ? not to re-act ? that label . If you find out that someone holds a negative label for some behavior of yours , you can change the behavior , thus tending to change her label . If you find out that she holds the label for her own internal , even mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your own script . You have won the power over your own life and mind . And you will not hate or blame the other for the label . That label has nothing to do with you , because you have chosen not to wear it . You feel good about yourself . People who feel good about themselves are not hateful . Hate of the other is really self-hate . The person choosing a hateful label to pin on you has the hate in him . It is not in you . The person who chooses to hate , even when by his perception you have harmed him , has chosen to hate instead of to correct you and to forgive . The hate is still his . He provokes his own hate ; you do not . So why bother to re-act hate to hate given ? If you choose to accept the other 's hate , and re-act it by throwing it back at him , it is now your hate , your choice , which you share with him . He does not provoke your hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke you to re-act his hate . Do you hate your professor for giving and grading an examination in which you received a " C " ? It is your hate which you must responsibly accept . I have met students who hate teachers for the low grades they earn . Some of these students perceive even " C 's " and " B 's " as " low . " But I was happy to receive " C 's " and " B 's " when I was a student . I received many of them . If I was happy to receive the same grades that other students resent , then the problem is not in the grades but in the ability or inability to be happy with them . It is the same with all areas of life . You are making yourself angry and hateful , not your parents , your teachers , your lovers , or anyone else . They all may indeed say and do things you do not like . Your reaction of hate is still yours . I failed a mathematics course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I did not hate my professor or school . I relieved the sadness by getting angry at myself , where the fault was , and relieved the anger by deciding then and there that I would pass the mathematics course next time and would take all the necessary steps toward that aim . The next term , with another professor who did not know I had  | failed the course the time before , so much did I study that I wore out the top edges of the pages of the mathematics book because of thumbing through the pages in study , again and again . The professor graded my examination and told me that I had abilities in mathematics and that I should major in it ! I received a " B. " And I was still happy . But I preferred not to wear his label of mathematician . I chose something else instead . And I made a miss-take . The major I chose was not good for me . So I changed again . In the same way all love for the other is really self-love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel bad . When you love someone the love in you makes you feel good . Hate and love are both internal feelings , not external objects . If you feel love for another you have chosen that symbol , that feeling of love , that positive label of loving to re-act . It is still your love , your perception , your capability , and your feeling . I do something you perceive as loving so you think I am the cause of your love . But that very act makes others feel hateful . So it is still back to the individual who reacts love or hate . If you love , it is your ability to perceive actions of others as lovable and it is your capability to feel love . But do n't you feel better loving than hating ? So choose what you wish to choose and take responsibility for your feelings , actions , reactions , interactions . If you abdicate responsibility you are a slave . You have shackled and enslaved your own self . You will hate yourself for this slavery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the cause of your slavery , thereby trying to relieve yourself of responsibility for your actions . But since you hold the key to your own actions and freedom , your hate will tend to lead you nowhere except into psychological and physical symptoms , such as headaches , skin eruptions , stomach pains , pains in your neck . " He is a pain in the neck . " But do n't you see that the pain you suffer is in your neck ? While working to understand the other , and his provocations , relieve yourself of his sticky web and keep the pain from your life . The provocation may have been the other 's , but the pain is yours . You hold the key to your own self . So unlock the door with that key , and enter another scene , one of forgiveness , understanding , and if necessary , open negotiation with others in the hope of resolution of differences . Or avoid those people who try to trip you into their own trouble . It is very common to let others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not common , it would not be possible to write about the tendencies of labels to fulfill themselves .   Exchange networks , and the symbols in them , have great psychological and social power . These make the social networks that band and bond us to one another . These exchanges give us love , companionship , support , and in the economic exchange network they provide shelter , clothes , food , and luxury products . The exchange networks have as much survival potential as the grooved network a duckling develops with its mother , which makes it imprint on her , thus following her about , helping toward creature survival . We are inclined to act from social and psychological imprinting processes . When exchanges are set , or labels are pasted on us , we have a psychological and social tendency to follow and re-act , as an imprinted duckling does . This tendency can lead us to benefits , as with the duckling , in communal , family , and sexual bondings . But it also can lead us to loss of freedom when we slavishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no choice . It does what its limited brain has it do for survival . But we as humans can choose , after our initial imprinting on the family in infancy , whom to follow and what to follow , what to accept and what to reject . Using the power of symbols we can choose our own . Knowing about exchanges we can develop our own . But given the force of habit , this is simpler to write and read about than to apply in our daily lives . Thus we will have difficulty writing and following our own scripts . Simplicity of action and total success are not being promised . Being a better human is being counselled , not an unattainable perfection . Imperfection in fact may well be a built-in trait of humanity ? but so much imperfection ? The religious advice to repay hate with love breaks negative labels and puts an end to the negative self-fulfilling prophecy . A hateful label is responded to in a positive ( loving ) manner , breaking the reaction pattern . The love beamed back ( reciprocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of negative for negative . There will be a tendency for cued love to be repaid lovingly by the person who cued hate at first . An ounce of love will sometimes break a negative exchange of hate . But sometimes a ton of love is needed to break the hateful reactions , so deep is the reaction pattern of hate embedded . The negative label pinned on you , or the negative exchange , may not be totally cued by you , but may be played out in response to you as well as in response to many years of perceived pain , hate , or other negatives from others . Thus love of one person , in one interaction , does   not always lead the negative exchange to a positive exchange . But even if the other persists in repaying hate to repeatedly repaid love , it is more pleasant not to get bound up into his hate . Sometimes repaying hate with love is dangerous . So deep is a person 's hate that sometimes a love response to it is perceived as a " wise-guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in his desperate need to provoke hate might even become violent . Also remember that repaying hate ( a negative ) with love ( a positive ) does not mean avoiding open conflict on real issues to negotiate solutions . It does mean bringing love into a relationship and with love conflicting openly , fairly , and functionally , so the conflict can be settled , avoiding seeds of discontent that lead to hate . Labels can be negative . Labels can be positive too . Both tend to lead to equal results in the self-fulfilling prophecy process . But labels are clinically best if they are reality-based , not " always good , " or " altogether bad . " If you label a person as good , and he stumbles and is bad , hurting you , you are disappointed . You may switch your label to bad . If you label a person as good , but remember that he has potentials for bad , which is the reality , you draw forth the good but are not disappointed when he stumbles occasionally to bad . Lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover as perfect , which tends to draw perfection . But since the lover is only human , which means in reality imperfect , he will make mistakes and will sometimes be hurtful too . Then the label shifts in the eyes of the partner . She is disappointed . Now she labels him as bad and her behavior tends to draw forth negative reactions . Suddenly she is " out of love . " The wise lover labels her lover as human which means she sees he has potentials for good and bad . She draws forth the good by expecting it and is ready for occasional bad too . She pays the occasional bad with love , knowing that the potential for good is there , hoping the loving label will elicit the good and love hidden for the moment . Excesses of negative behavior may be treated by various means , including psychotherapy . It is sometimes out of the power of a lover to treat this . But it should be clearly understood that the person who exhibits horrid negatives also has positives lying latent . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to label even a very difficult person as totally bad , for this is not reality either , just as no one is totally good . The reality is that everyone has potential for good and evil .   Everyone sometimes misunderstands . Even some of the greatest psychiatrists had terrible , unresolved conflicts with their colleagues and friends and were incapable of following their own advice . I am so proficient writing about negatives because I have so many of them . Everyone makes mistakes . Everyone tends too often to think that his own symbols are the only reality , thus having the inclination to be angry at or annoyed at those who symbol differently . Thus the higher reality is really the dialectical swings of highs and lows , foolishness and wisdom , good and bad , hate and love , positive and negative , in all groups and in all people . Ups and downs , positives and negatives , joys and sorrows , are all bound up in one another . Sometimes one dimension pokes out while the other is covered . But the potential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negative side of the dialectic , because these call forth the negative side of the dialectic . Realize that the negative is shared by all , but do not stick a label on someone which will stick him on the negative , and do not keep yourself stuck on a negative label just because someone has put it there on you . The negative label tends to bring forth the negative from the dialectic . A positive label tends to bring forth the positive from the dialectic . But all people and groups are capable of foolish and " low " behavior as well as " high " behavior , and that is part of the reality . Accept this . Magically call forth the positive potential by positive labels and expectations , rather than sticking a group , person , or yourself on negative potentials . It surely is better to call forth positive than negative . The magic is to call forth by the will of your own mind ( the ability to symbol however you wish ) the positive by setting the act of positive which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . In a broad way this is known in psychotherapy circles as reality therapy , ' which sets positive labels and positive expectations on clients . This tends to bring forth positive behavior which reinforces self-esteem , loving behavior , and generalized positive life scripts , which others tend to react to , improving the person 's own life and his social interactive life as well . But understand that it is very human to have negative potentials which can surface even if you label positively . Plant beautiful flowers but do not be disappointed when a weed comes out too . It is one of the potentials of nature . Plant good thoughts in your mind . Plant good thoughts in the minds of other people . In other words , plant positive labels , and   with appropriate nurturing it could be expected , but not promised , that a positive crop will result . But remember , humans and gardens sprout weeds too , as much as you try to eliminate them . A gardener plants those beautiful flower seeds he wishes to see grow . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If weeds come out in your garden keep nurturing the flowers and cut the weeds . The result may be a beautiful garden . It is the same with people . Realize , too , that " weed " is also a label , and see the effects on the weed . Why is a dandelion ugly ? Does n't it have its own beauty , a beauty that can be magically called forth by our own perception , our own act of will ? That beauty in a dandelion , which is called forth by refusing to be limited to other people 's labels , is also reality . A weed has been transformed into a beautiful flower ! A delinquent , an insane person , a thief , may be seen as exhibiting negative traits . They are the weeds of society . So try to draw more positive traits from them . But if you listen carefully to what they say and perceive what it is that their actions act out , you may learn that their behavior can be used as a commentary on society , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . We can learn from them what changes are necessary in our behavior , and in social exchange relationships , to avoid these reactions . We can thus even draw a positive potential from their behavior by learning from them . If a child has become insane we should avoid the permanent label insane , and we should try to bring more positive behavior forward . But we can study what happened in the family , in school , and with the peer group that led him to this insane reaction . We can then make clinical improvements in these social exchange networks for this child , and for all others , to avoid conditions that cause insanity . If we stopped to really look at a dandelion instead of labelling it as negative at first sight we might see that it does have beauty . If we looked at negative human traits we might see something helpful there too . Some tribes of people gather to respectfully sit with someone who has had a psychotic episode . They ask , " What did you see ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trip to the " other world . " They are learning . Their people who fly off into another world are not labelled insane . They are positively labelled " visionaries . " And while the tribe is respectfully   sharing the psychotic 's trip it seems that the tribesmen are doing the same thing a psychiatrist does . They are entering the psychotic 's world . They learn to understand the world on his terms . They are giving respectful support which is nurturing . They are bringing forth positive potentials . They are learning from the psychotic and they are curing him . Perhaps the tribesman saw ghosts who were dancing in angry circles . What does this symbol ? As with the reality of dreams , a psychotic episode may bring forth , in symbolic terms , a personal or social truth that may have otherwise been repressed . Perhaps the behavior of the tribe is such that some tribe-induced natural disaster is soon to come . The ghosts might be the tribesmen stomping down the ground and game , which will lead to a natural disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " vibes " together , which others who are less sensitive miss . The " vibes " tell something to those who , like the psychotic , have sense to listen . Some students tell me when I lecture as I am writing here that they think I am crazy . " So much the better , " I respond . " Now use this special chance which you have not had with the sane to learn how a crazy person thinks , and you will have learned important lessons . " In the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast , Beauty transforms the ugly beast into a Prince Charming by kissing him , accepting him , perceiving the beauty of his spirit under his ugly exterior . She loves him . This calls forth his princely and charming attributes . This is a powerful magic . ' Rub your head , say the magic words , and " poof , " an ugly creature becomes a Prince Charming , dandelions become pretty yellow flowers and magic puffballs , a horrid teacher becomes a kindly gentleman trying to teach something against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to be a fairy godmother , an enemy becomes a pained human being who also has hidden princely virtues , and a Hitler is seen as a sick man who can teach us about sickness but who must not be followed , no matter what propaganda tells you . The symbol you use makes you feel positive or negative and it also leads to the tendency of the other to re-act your label . This is the magic power . " What a dumb statement ! " Rub your head and say the magic words , " What a human statement , " and perceive the results in you and in the other . You have changed the pinned label from dumb to human and you maintain the right to disagree . Now study the reactions in you and in the other . This is a very practical   sociological experiment testing effects of labels . The same magic applies to nature as it does to people . " What a bitter wind . " Instead say , " How invigorating that wind is . " Try some other changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this positive magic without having learned or thought about it . Lovers walk in the rain without an umbrella and are happy . They kiss one another in the midst of a downpour . They tumble together in the snow . They walk ? happy ? hand in hand in the heat . The love in each lover 's own self creates happiness no matter what the weather . They attribute their joy to one another . But anyone can put himself in a loving frame of mind and can learn to love the wind , cold , heat , sun , rain , through loving symbols and reactions . If you can not , find out why . Why , for example , is it that you or anyone prefers to be unhappy with the wind , heat , or anything else ? Also , remember , just saying words is not enough ; they have to be felt too . Just working words in the mind is half the job . The other half is working the feeling in the heart . William I. Thomas and Dorothy Swaine Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are real in their consequences . " " ( This is now known in sociology as the Thomas Theorem . ) It is the definition of the situation that " counts . " If people define otherwise , the consequences may be otherwise . Labels , which are symbols pasted on anyone or anything , tend toward real consequences . In sociological analysis the important point is not " objectivity , " but the subjective interpretations made by people ? their definitions of the situation ? that lead to very real results . It is what people feel , think , define in relation to the " objective fact " that " counts " because that leads to real consequences . A person thinks he is ugly . He may be off center or " unreal " in his perception , but the consequences in the form of unhappiness , sense of inferiority and loss of self-esteem are very real and even scientifically measurable . His behavior based on the perception of ugliness may also be such that it drives others away , adding to his sense of inferiority and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks because of his ugliness . Remember the process whereby symbols set interactions , then reactions and exchanges . All of these are real in consequences , even if the symbol was off center or " unreal " in objective fact . The Thomas Theorem , stating that if people define situations to be real , then they are real in their consequences , is one of the basing points that explains labelling processes . The Thomas Theo- rem , together with the self-fulfilling prophecy , and the understanding of symbols , makes the essence of the labelling perspective . A Case For Practice Analysis A clinical social work graduate student was committed to a mental hospital because he got drunk , was jailed , and in jail threatened suicide , cursed , drank from the toilet bowl , and urinated on the mattress . He did none of these things . A student colleague , masquerading as his brother , only said he did , in order that he could be committed , so he could test and research what it feels like , from the inside participation . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his supervising professor , who worked in another wing of the hospital . Once admitted , he took care to act in a normal ? not insane ? manner . But his treatment by staff had less to do with his behavior than did his label , " psychotic . " Doctors and nurses were reluctant to acknowledge any normal behavior . In yet another study , a sane researcher committed to an asylum had the following written into his record : " Patient engages in writing behavior . " He was taking notes for his study . What a researcher who is labelled sane does is sane . He is taking notes on observations . But an insane person " engages in writing behavior. " 5 Perhaps such an insane person was writing of his feelings and problems in a diary . This could be a distinct aid in psychotherapy . Perhaps he was writing poetry . This could be a creative bridge toward understanding the patient 's mind processes and images . It was never presumed that an insane person 's writing had any importance in itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tribesmen who question their psychotic on what he saw do not put " engages in seeing behavior " on records . They share the vision . They respect it . They learn from it . The staff of modern psychiatric hospitals might benefit from learning more and recording less about their patients . The graduate student , currently a professor of sociology , found that , " Once caught in the system ... it was impossible to convince anyone that ... I was sane .... If somebody thought I was crazy , all my behavior was seen as abnormal to them . " A similar case is reported in a touching study of a labelled " retarded " person who is treated as such . But he proceeds , with minimal education , to   make a beautiful analysis of labelling processes for a sociological researcher . He shows much insight and intelligence when given the opportunity by a researcher who respects his powers of mind and perceptions . As soon as the graduate student was committed , his status changed . The privileges of normal human being were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as were the other patients . If the feet were lifted the slippers fell off . As a result the patients had to glide along the floor giving the appearance of abnormality . He was talked to in a voice usually reserved for little children . When he was interviewed by a psychiatrist he took pains to act " normal , " but the psychiatrist came up with reasons for his " craziness . " He was constantly bombarded in his hospital stay with assertions that he needed psychiatric help and that he could not be trusted . ( The staff may have been trying to get him to accept the fact that he was in a new show called hospital with roles unlike those on the outside , thus stage managing , and achieving control over the patient . ) Of course the symptoms he presented on admission were extreme , such as threatening suicide . The medical staff had no reason to doubt the truth of the symptoms and acted accordingly . ( But the patients did doubt the truth of the label " mentally ill " put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The medical staff accepted the story of the man who brought him to the hospital . But suppose the person who accompanied him to the hospital was lying , or suppose he was insane ? Evidence of normal behavior did not lead to doubt on the part of the medical staff as to whether the patient indeed was insane or had a temporary , odd episode due to his drunkenness . And in the " writing behavior " case mentioned earlier , several " normal " people were committed as part of a study . They ' were treated as insane for a symptom of nothing more extreme than hearing voices that said " empty , " " hollow , " and " thud . " They did not threaten suicide , or say that they drank from the toilet bowl ? but once admitted they were treated as quite insane . The student 's professor came to bail him out , expressing the nature of the experiment . The physician in charge misinterpreted why the professor was there . Under the influence of the label which stuck he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness . He thought the professor came for a patient , not for a researcher who acted like a patient . When he finally realized that the patient was   " a plant " he became very embarrassed . The label was finally broken . The researcher was surprised that this hospital was like this because of its fame for its clinical psychiatry . It is supposedly better than average mental hospitals . ' Analyze this case , and other life situations , by using the labelling perspective . What is the behavior you are analyzing ? What are the labels ? What is the reality ? Where did the labels come from ? Whose labels are they ? Why do the participants hold these labels ? What are the consequences of the labels ? How did the labels cause the behavior ? Show the " label ? act ? re-act ? interact " processes , once the label is pinned on a participant in the groups or life situations studied . Are the labels projections ? If so , in what ways ? With what effects ? What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of the definition of the situation ? Where is the self-fulfilling prophecy ? How would , should , could the label be broken ? What are the consequences of breaking the label ? How would , should , could the label be changed ? How can a person get out of a label pinned on him ? Show where and how the Thomas Theorem operates . With what consequences ? How should the behavior studied be viewed by participants to avoid negative self-fulfilling prophecies ? What are the real potentials of the person or group labelled ? Remember the discussion in this chapter about dialectical human potentials . Where have labels neglected these potentials ? How can positive potentials be pulled from a person or group ? Restructure the scene in this case ? and others ? by choosing labels for more humane behavior . In your mind , set up a ward of psychologically disturbed people , a dormitory for students , a work organization , and other social groups . In your mind , pin labels on the people . Think through the consequences . Change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an efficient and humane organization of the ill , the old , the young , students ? Answer this question by using the concepts and insights of this chapter and the other chapters read thus far .   The Structural-Functional Perspective THE structural-functional perspective looks at , analyzes , and tries to understand social life by studying structures and functions . Looking at the structure and function of social life enables us to perceive the grooved actions and reactions which make exchange webs . Perceiving the structures allows us to follow what functions come from them . Functions are observed consequences which make for the adaptation and adjustment of the unit studied . Study of structures and functions enables us to analyze , understand , predict , and improve human behavior . Social life has structure and function . Other things also have structure and function . Specialists in all fields must learn about and understand the structures and functions of that which they study . There are in this world atomic structures , biological structures , geological structures , architectural structures , and social structures , among others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . The parts of our bodies do ? for example , the heart . The skeleton has and gives structure . There are rock structures , crystal structures , and cellular structures . Groups , families , schools , hospitals , armies , football teams , and bureaucracies also have structure ; said another way , these are social structures . They are structured . All are patterned , networked , grooved webs of exchange relationships and interactions where every part is interrelated to every other part . All of these structures , and others , have functions ( to perform ) with consequences for the system . All of these structures , if operating properly , perform functionally . This means that they perform  | according to their inherent properties , according to their basic purposes , and according to their basic functions . They meet their aims or goals or the reasons for which they are structured . In human events functions and functionings are seen as functional or dysfunctional . Functions and dysfunctions are symbols , which have to be specified so everyone knows about what each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified , as in algebra , where we break into the structure of a problem by representationally structuring it in the mathematical perspective of : let X equal . . . , let Y equal .... In algebra , as in any other area of life , each part of the equation ( each part of the represented structure studied ) balances the others . Everything done to any one part does something in reciprocation to the others . Thus in algebra it is possible to make exchanges based on the symbols . We work on the variables which stand in balance ? and reach a solution . As we make the exchanges we change , on a cause-effect , act-react basis , each part of the equation , maintaining balance at the same time . By manipulating the variables , always maintaining the balance ? that is the relationships among parts ? we finally come to the answer of what the " unknown " is . This is a beautiful vision of the structure of life , in which all parts stand in relation . I found algebra a pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understood , more recently , that algebra actually reflects the beautiful structure and relationships of life , I understood its basic premise . Now it is only a matter of practicing the special techniques of algebra to solve problems with it . It is especially exciting to realize that this vision is applicable to all areas of life , including human social relationships . A structure would collapse without balance . So would an algebraic equation . In other words , both need balance ? a balance of interdependencies ? to function and subsist and exist . Algebra follows life and models its interdependencies ( relationships ) and systemic balances . It is used as a method to enter a problem and to work the variables ( the units of the structure ) , so a solution to the problem can be found . Since everything in life is systematically arranged , which means that they are systems , which means that every part is interrelated to every other part , then it can be understood why algebra , reflecting some portion of systemic life , has the rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the equation must have an effect on the other side .   It is my opinion that teaching algebra in this manner would expand its use from that which students often see as a useless set of exercises in which little numbers and letters are pushed here and there for the solution to meaningless problems . Students who perceive that algebra is a representation of all of life see how relevant , meaningful , and exciting it is . Algebra does not only rest on empty memorization of mathematical rules . It really enters the extraordinary complexity ? but in essence simplicity ? of the systemic balances and relationships evident in all areas of life , including human relationships . Algebra helps us to enter any structure , by using symbols of X , Y , plus , minus , and others . Since every part of a structure is systematically connected , in a system , we work the symbols , tracing the connections , until we find an answer to the part of the problem that is unknown . This is as true for the study of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems , trace the variables ? and their connections and interconnections ? to determine what the structure ( made up of interrelated variables ) is , and what the functionings are . For example , what are the systematic relations in the structure of a marriage ? When husband says and does ... ( on one side of the equation ) what is the networked exchange response by wife ( on the other side of the equation ) ? Such responses and expectations are part of the social structure of the relationship . There is a structure grooved into the relationship that frees the partners for action ? or constrains them . Pick any starting point , as in the algebraic " let X equal . . . , " set up an equation ( a representation of the structural pieces in balance ) , and start to study and work the variables , which all stand in interrelationship . In other words , enter the structure and begin to trace relationships . You see the relationship of the items one to the other and can reorder them . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , adding or subtracting something on one side demands adding to or subtracting something from the other side . Then the place and portion where the " unknown " is can be determined and there is a solution to the problem . Causes and effects can be seen . This systemic equational balance is extremely difficult to describe in words , which is exactly why we have the symbol system of algebra to help us . It simplifies a problem to its barest variables and structure , in the stark symbols of letters and numbers , and simplifies the solution to a problem .   In a like manner studying and understanding social variables and their systemic relationships helps us to understand behavior of social groups and their members . This is the perspective of structural-functional analysis . Know what place the people occupy in a structure , determine the structure and functioning , see what connection they have to the structure , see how they are part of the functioning , see what structural variables press them on one side , and trace the corresponding changes in behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure is achieved . There are many systems , for example , bodily , solar , and architectural systems . All have ' structure . Said another way , all parts of each structure are systematically related . How they are related , in what configuration , makes the structure . The structure is the grooved network where the units exchange with , that is relate to , the others . Pull one beam out of a building and the total building may be weakened , meaning that there is extra stress on the other parts . What was done to that one beam affects the others and the structure . Take out another , and another , and at some point the remaining beams , girders , and reinforcements can not bear the stress and strain and the structure collapses . The structure is de-struct-ed , meaning that it falls to a destructured , destructed position of destruction . In human affairs the collapse of the South Vietnamese army in 1975 was such an event , resulting from excessive political , social , military , internal , and external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army disintegrated , along with the civilian political structure , to an extent catching even the enemy forces unprepared and surprised . A change in one part of a system , of a structure ( with its systematically interrelated parts ) , affects the other parts . Here I have been describing the breakdown , the destruction of a system . But the reverse occurs in building a system . Beams and girders in buildings , exchange webs in human groups , are added and added , and piece by piece the structure is constructed . We are constructing a structure . It is relatively simple to see a building constructed piece by piece , unit by unit . Even if workers simultaneously began the work in separate sections , for example putting in the basement at the same time walls are being constructed , there is still a systematic unit-by-unit construction within each section . Unit-by-unit construction means that each piece is put into place , and at some point   all the units are integrated into an integral whole . The integration really is the systemic connection of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When something is integrated all of its component parts fit into place , and it operates ( functions ) as an integral ( whole ) system . When a system collapses the reverse process occurs . There is dis-integration ( disintegration ) , and unit by unit it falls apart . This is not so simple to perceive . This is because a construction is frequently a slow process which our eyes and minds can follow ? a type of slow motion . But a destruction often occurs as a catastrophic event . A building may collapse in an earthquake . A bridge collapses in a flood . An army collapses in a panic . Sometimes the destruction occurs in a matter of seconds or minutes . This is not a motion slow enough for most people to perceive . They only see a commotion and the final outcome of destruction . But the trained analyst familiar with structural-functional analysis , in any field , is capable of slowing the motion in his mind to the point that he perceives the unitby-unit breakdown . He is often interested in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical reasons too . If it is known how something collapsed it is often known why it collapsed , and precautions can be taken in the future to strengthen the weak links in the systemic relational network , so collapse will not occur again . This study is routine in collapses of bridges , buildings and aircraft . I advise that every social collapse ? even of marriages ? be studied this way too . Knowing causes and processes we can arrange better structures to maintain the proper functionings without the pain involved with collapse . In actuality there is order in disorder . It might have surprised you when I said the South Vietnamese Army collapsed unit by unit . How could such a major catastrophic breakdown occurring in such a commotion be called a simple unit-by-unit collapse ? I am pointing to an ordered process in what everyone knows was disorder . What I wrote just does not seem to fit rationality . But it does fit if you expand your vision . The structural analyst researches disorder to find its ordered sequence of unit-by-unit events . There must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . In other words disorder has structural and functional attributes too , which can be studied . Disorder and order are only symbols . The reality of both is that they contain elements of structure . In disorder the structure is in a process of breakdown . This breakdown is part of a dialectical process built into the structures and functions of systems .  | Since systems are units with boundaries ( which the human observer must symbol ) , the edges of one system press upon that which is supposedly ( in our symbol system ) external to it . The external presses on the internal and pushes on and pulls from it . The internal presses on the external and pushes on and pulls from it . Actually they set up the first elements of a relational system that connect over time , sometimes in split seconds as in parts of the world of physics , and sometimes longer , as in the growth of love between the system called man and the system called woman . This operation leads to co-operation ( cooperation ) . Separateness becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look different ? or even opposite ? become unified in a swinging orbital system of two ( or more ) separate parts in unison . If there are separate parts in unison , of course there is a built-in dialectic , where opposites , differences , and units maintain elements of individuality and union at the same time . The analyst of dialectics can see these dialectical potentials and the dialectical operations . Here a type of disorder , or even nonorder , between supposedly unrelated systems becomes systemically ordered in a larger system . Dialectically , the potential for the opposite lies in the system . Stresses and strains , influences of other external events and units ? for example the influence of an earthquake on a bridge , or the influence of unemployment on a family , and the many social processes causing conflict in human relationships discussed in an earlier chapter ? press the system to disorder . If there is not enough " bend " in the system the processes of disorder step by step take over until there is a collapse , which to the untrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When disorder is complete then there is no relational system and we have rubble in the natural world . In the world of humans we can have unrelated masses of people . But while the process of disorder is occurring there is still a relational system , but a weakening one , where the glue of each unit to each unit loosens , until unit by unit there is a collapse . However , even in total collapse there is still rudimentary order , and the potential for more and more order in systemic relations . Unrelated objects still have rudimentary connections to other things which connect to other things in a chain that networks across everything that exists , existed , and will exist . A pipe resting on the ground , separated from the system of a building that collapsed , rusts over time and becomes part of the earth .   The earth sharing the rust and the insect living in the space between the earth and the rusting pipe , are only small parts of a network of very broad ecological balances , even in what appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This explanation ? disarmingly simple and exciting to those who see it , absurd to those who do not ? was necessary to help you to understand why the collapse of the South Vietnamese Army , or anything else , is a unit-by-unit event . It may be difficult to see it in the mass commotion that occurred at that time . But just as there is no way for a system to be built and to function except unit by unit , in the same way there must be ? by the nature of a systemunit-by-unit breakdown . By unit by unit I do not mean first Division One collapsed , then precisely one hour later Division Two did , then Three . Remember that I am not using a linear model of thought so common today , especially among the educated . I am using an orbital frame of thought , based upon the way things are in reality . I do mean that a unit presses and pulls on other units . Weak links crack the connection . This strains other units . The pressures build geometrically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breaking point is reached , and in essence , unit by unit , the system collapses . Just as a building can be built from several places at once , unit by unit , so can it collapse from strains emanating from many places , leading to unit-by-unit breakdown . Systems may be seen as organically related entities ; each part is part of an organization ( organ-ization ) . This means that all parts connect to the others and are interrelated . An organ of the body , and an organism , have interrelated parts which are organized , and which work ( function ) , organically . A social organization also has organs and works organically , with each part related to each and every other part , in functions . Organs , organisms , and organizations , in which parts are organically related one to the other , all have structure , and functions . Any change in any part of the organ , organism , organization , has an effect on all the other parts , on the structure , and on the function . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When function is changed , structure is affected . ( This point will be more fully discussed later . ) These points are so disarmingly simple that many people become confused and think it is complex . The system may be very complex , with many parts ( such as the United States governmental and bureaucratic system ) , but the simplicity is that every part is organically related to all the   other parts . Understand this and " everything fits into place , " as is commonly said . Actually all the pieces of the structure fit into place . The understanding that a change in one part will at some point have an effect on all other parts , and on the total system , is crucial for the efficient understanding of or change of any system , whether a city traffic system , an automobile engine , an army , a business , a factory , or a marriage . Even the birth of one helpless , tiny baby causes a whole series of systemic and interactive changes that touch wife , husband , their relationship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their life relationships they would not be taken aback by or get into trouble because of such changes . They could predict that when baby is born , or mother visits , that systemic changes will result . But one change in a system , for example more funds for the poor , may be added to or confounded by many other changes and pressures in the larger system . These also have to be studied . They are also part of the structural equation . Sometimes people are angered by and blame others , such as the poor , for not fully reacting positively to a social improvement program or to some other perceived positive change . The change should have some effect on the social system and people in it , but may be negated , confounded , added to , and in many ways changed by other systemic pressures , relationships , stresses and strains . The equation is much the more complicated than only the one change leading to an immediate reaction in the desired direction anticipated . Giving a patient strong doses of antibiotics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing imbalance ( dis-ease ) , may also kill many of the other bacteria not causing the disease , thus disrupting the ecological balance of the bodily system . This may lead to a problem of digestion because the bacteria help digest food by eating this food too . Fungus infections may result because the bacteria were eating the fungi . Systems can be very complex . Sometimes many major and minor adjustments ( the latter called " fine-tuning " ) , are necessary for beneficial change . Human groups and relationships may be seen as structures , as social systems . In a marriage , for example , everything one partner does or says has an effect on the other . How do you break into the ongoing system , the moving equilibrium , to understand what is happening , to solve a problem , or to make a change ? Frame by frame analysis , as discussed elsewhere , is one method . Another is to use a structural algebraic approach . For example , break into the   exchanges of wife on one side of the equation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wife , put mother on that side of the equation . Take the vantage point and meaning system of one , then the other partner . State , by " good husband " the wife means ... ( Let X equal . . . ) , by " good husband " the husband means .. . ( Let Y equal ... ) , and so on over many variables . Transfer meanings , and actions , from one side of the equation to the other so understandings are reached , and negative behavior is cancelled . The working of variables on each side of the equation is called negotiation , and dialoguing , in human interactions . Exchanges can be made . In fact , putting variables on one side of the equation to the other , and mutual additions and cancellations on each side of the equation , are exchanges . A give on one side of the equation must be balanced with a give on the other . There is a break into the misunderstood exchanges and symbols . A different balance is achieved . Negotiation shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shifts variables from minus to plus or reverse . Some variables are cancelled by negotiated exchanges . " If I stop doing this , will you stop doing that , which makes me do this which makes you do that ? " But if one partner takes too much and does not give a perceived balanced response , then the relationship is still unbalanced , and the equation is not one , meaning it is not equal on each side . Said another way , it is ill-balanced , and will have tendencies to topple . It shows dis-ease . If a different , more functional ( as perceived ) balance is achieved , then the problem is solved . Stresses and strains are removed from the structure . The social relationship is then perceived as functional . Focusing on one side of the equation , let us say on the faults of husband , is blame making , which adds heat and another variable to the equation . This does not help toward resolution of the problem . The problem is better resolved by understanding that a relationship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from and is affected by and reacts to every other part . Attention can be focused on what comes between people in the mooing balance , the moving equilibrium , over time . This is comparable to the moving parts of an engine , which do not stay in one place ; they function while moving , in a balance with the other parts . If one part is improperly connected , it does not relate functionally to the other parts , and there is an engine malfunction . Remember the rule in algebra that whatever is done on one side  | of the equation has to be done on the other side , to maintain balance . Putting attention on one person , such as husband , without anticipating , perceiving , and working corresponding changes on the other side of the equation , such as wife , is not only improper algebra , but it is devoid of sociological understanding , and it is unfair , too . If you bother me you are to blame . But what did I do to make you want to bother me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do to make me want to bother you which makes you bother me ? So who is to blame ? And why do I react to your bothering me ? So I am to blame . And why do I symbol what you do as bothersome ? I could have done otherwise . So I am to blame . But why do you symbol what I do as irritating to make you want to bother me in return , which I symbol as bothersome , which makes me want to bother you in return ? So who is to blame ? Many human relationships , certainly many marriages , and international relations , are ruined by these series of escalating blamings . These escalated blamings become so much a part of the relationship that any real issue is covered by the noise of faultfinding and reactions to it . Note how fast the charges of one on the other , about one and the other , rush to affect the relationship until the structure , . the equation of related parts , is struggling to maintain itself under this heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blaming , break into the systematic interrelationships and find out what really , truly , has " come between " the participants which leads to **47;782;TOOLONG . These actions @#@ #@# reactions make the structure . It is not he or she or this country or that country that stand as the important part of the problem , but what comes between them . It is how he and she in love relationships , and this and that country in international relationships , relate in their relationship which is the problem area . To our eyes the " between " part seems invisible ; the people and countries seem concrete and visible . But the " between " part is what has to be studied , analyzed , understood , and improved for better functioning . A building looks like a solid mass . It is . But a building is also composed of many connecting parts which stand in relation to one another . The connecting points of the connecting parts are the " between " parts . All the parts and all the " betweens " ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " between " parts may not be visible to the untrained . But the " between " is still there . Germs are not visible to the naked eye . This does not make them less a cause of disease .   Enter , as a researcher and analyst , the moving , balanced system of symbols and exchanges . Study the " between " parts . Study the parts of the interaction system where there are connections . Work the symbols and variables . Symbol real issues . Do not blame but negotiate . Cancel blame on one side which must cancel blame on the other . Cancel one behavior on one side which should cancel a behavior on the other . Add an interaction on one side which should add an interaction on the other . Find out what can please both partners . Add this to the equation . Determine systemic influences on the structure from outside ( external ) structures , such as parents in a marriage . Work on these variables too . Find a solution to bring the relationship ( the relating parts ) into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is solved , until the moving parts create friction on another series of interactions . Stop the engine momentarily . Let it cool . Add a lubricant . Turn it on again . Check the systems in it . Is there still friction ? Loosen some screws and tighten others until you find what works . You can kick the engine in anger if you wish . But what help will that give for the repair of the problem ? It would be wise to stop kicking fellow humans about . Instead work to restructure and improve relationships and their interactive parts . More peace and harmony and longer-lasting and more satisfying relationships should result . Lean on a table . Listen to it " moan and groan " under the stress and strain . A part may crack if you lean on it with too much weight . People who are under structural pressure also moan and groan . The poor may moan and groan when the economy provides no work for their self-support , while the society puts barriers to or negative connotations on the collection of public assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one direction , his conscience presses him in another , and members of management press him in still another direction . The " moaning and groaning " may be manifested in shouting , loss of temper , violence , weeping , among other means of expressing the pain of pressure . Press hard enough and the person pressured may " crack , " or " crack under the strain , " as is commonly and structurely correctly said . He finds life too " stressful . Check out the structure . Change the structure . The moaning and groaning may be decreased as rapidly and as simply as by refraining from leaning on the table . Or the structure can be strengthened to take the pressure . When people are relieved of the structur- al pressure of " taking it from all sides " ( note the structural terminology in this common expression ) , or when you and others " get the weight off their backs , " as is colorfully , structurally , correctly , and commonly said , then they stop moaning and groaning . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality variables . Some people are whiners and weepers and moan and groan as a response to life in general and do the same in any structure . These need to change some symbols in their minds for more positive reactions to life . An amateur carpenter built a table . It shook and moaned and groaned under the slightest weight . The table was structured as in the simplified one-sided diagram ( Fig. 1 ) below . Actually , it was not structured properly . This affected the function .   Compare Figures 1 and 2 . It is obvious that there is a different relation of parts . Figure 1 does not look the same as Figure 2 . This is because they represent tables which are structured differently . The new structure had a positive ( functional ) effect on the function . The table performed its function more functionally . The shaking and moaning and groaning stopped . This is what is meant by " working structural variables " and changing structures for better functioning . Do the same with human groups and people . Sometimes adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work to reduce stress and strain and friction . Sometimes removing a part will do this . The table , at least in external perception , without considering its atomic structure , is a static entity . Human groups are moving systems , which create , add , and live with symbols . Add a buffer to the table and the structure reacts by laws of nature to stop moaning and groaning . Do the same with people and they may start a louder wailing because they think that they do not like the new buffer . Or they moan and groan because they were not consulted first . Or they just do not like the idea of a buffer . Sometimes the buffer , for example a foreman who takes the weight of management from the top and the pressure of workers from the bottom , starts to moan and groan . He too can not stand the weight on his back . The management does not want the weight , so it puts it on the buffer position of foreman . The workers do not like the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the foreman does not like the weight either . We have to consider the feelings and symbols of all human parts in a social structure , unlike the simplicity of working the structure of inanimate objects . It may be more complex but it is more exciting to work with people than with inanimate objects . It is also more troublesome . Let us trace an example of steps in structural-functional analysis , using a government agency as an example . In a government bureaucracy ( or elsewhere ) we need to ask : what unit ( for example , department , employees , clients ) are we going to study ? Said another way , which dimension of a multidimensional entity do we wish to study ? From what perspective and from whose perspective do we wish to start our analysis ? What is our basing point for functions ? Shall we study the function of productivity ? By what measures ? What do we mean by productivity ? By productivity do we mean efficiency , quantity , quality , or some combination ? And what are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the   interactions . All of these must be specified . Having set our equation , in the form of " let the unit studied be . . . , " " let the function measured be . . . " ( as in the algebraic , " let X equal " ) we can then specify functional consequences or dysfunctional consequences of the structure studied , and we can trace connections of the structure to the function and the function to the structure . Everything the social exchanges in the structured system " do " to lead to a structure which fulfills this " X " of what is defined by function equals a functional consequence . Everything that deviates and detracts from this " X " we call a dysfunctional consequence . Let us use biology as another example . The structure of the body functions . When it stops functioning it dies . When the body ( as the unit of analysis ) functions according to plan , this is seen as functional . When a portion of the usual body structure is upset or destructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease by humans . There is dis-ease , ill-balance , and symptoms of bodily stress and strain , including a moaning and groaning of the patient . The structure is strained and the function is affected . We might say that there is no need here to ask " functional for whom or for what unit ? " But this is because we are too highly caught up in our own symbols as humans . Taking the vantage point of the bacteria the disease is functional . From the vantage point of the person it is dysfunctional . From the vantage point of the doctor who earns his living by treating disease it is functional ( to help his economic support ) . For the physician , according to his desire to help people and fulfill himself as a healer , the disease is dysfunctional and the medical procedure is functional . From the vantage point of the bacteria as a unit , treatment is dysfunctional because it attacks and thwarts their functioning . The patient ( another unit ) can perceive the treatment as dysfunctional and refuse to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sicker or functional results if he gets well . The treatment may be severe but functional in the short run because it saves the patient . But there may be very dysfunctional long-term consequences of the severe treatment , such as a loss of good functioning in another organ system years later . It should now be understood why we must specify functional/ dysfunctional from which vantage point , from what participant or participants in the system , by what standards , and for what unit of analysis , and for what time period . It is the same with marriage ,   another structured system . What is functional as perceived by a husband 's ( a unit of analysis ) needs and wants is not necessarily so for the wife ( a unit of analysis ) , or for the marriage ( a unit of analysis ) . If the husband meets his immediate needs or wants this might be functional as perceived by him , taking him only as the unit of analysis . But if his wife perceives what he gets as dysfunctional for her this then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysfunctional results in marital turmoil or loss of her love , which might make the immediate functional outcome dysfunctional for him and the marriage when using a longer time frame . This is why it is important to specify what is meant by functional and dysfunctional and for what period of time , for what units , and for what system . Then the analysis can begin from that vantage point . It is possible to also make and use at will other equations from other units or vantage points or systems , or participants in the system . Then analyses from one vantage position can be compared to that of another . This provides a multidimensional view of the structure and functions . What is functional for one department in a government bureaucracy may be dysfunctional for another . What is functional for the taxpayer might possibly be dysfunctional for the bureaucrat who is fired to save taxpayer money . It might be dysfunctional for both , if taxpayer services are reduced . But some taxpayers might see reduced services as a functional consequence , especially if they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs and perceptions , might see the same reduction as dysfunctional . Again , it is necessary to get a starting point and to select a vantage point by saying " let X equal , " as in algebra . In sociological analysis we say , in a comparable manner , " by function I mean ... , " " by unit of study I mean the following ( e.g. , a person , a group , a department , an agency , the government , the state , and the like ) . " It is no different in the body . Do we wish to study the heart , lungs , skeletal system , or brain , or the whole body at once ? Which unit ? It is a matter of how deep and intricate , how small or large we want to focus our analysis . For sociological analysis , in the same way , do we want to study a small work group , its structure , its functioning and dysfunctions ? Or do we want to study a department of several work groups ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or do we want to focus attention on the entire bureaucracy ? Or do we want to study only the section of it  | in San Francisco ? With these decisions we abstract the study unit for the moment from the larger units and make a study of how it is structured and what are its functions . If we wish , we can in addition use any of the perspectives already discussed in other chapters , such as conflict , exchange , or dramaturgy . Diagrams can help make structures and systems and interdependencies visible . Medical books have diagrams of human anatomy so students can trace bodily structures and functions . Books on chess have diagrams specifying players and moves , so the structure of the game can be made visible to the reader . Companies have organization charts which trace formal structures and desired functioning . The business executive uses these to visualize the operations of the units he leads . If he wishes to change an operation he reworks the lines on the diagram . He restructures , on paper , with the aim of changed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he then tries to put the changes into actual business operations . An X-ray photograph is a picture of a bodily part . A surgeon studies the picture and uses it as a diagram of the parts and their relationships and how they are structured . He may decide on an operation . He traces on the X-ray picture where he wishes to restructure , for improved functioning . He can take X-ray photographs from different vantage points . A football coach uses diagrams of plays and team positions . His too is a game of structure . He uses the diagrams to " spot " improvements for his team , weaknesses in the other team , and creates plays for better team functioning for the aim of winning the game . The diagrams can help him to transmit his vision of what he wants to the team members . The coach is also working structural-functional variables . The job of the coach is that of motivating , leading , teaching players , and shifting and changing team structure in relation to the actions and reactions of the other team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone the coach on the field , they are really trying to spot problems of structure in their own team that must be tightened , loosened , changed , and fixed . They also observe the other team so their weaknesses or structural " holes " can be reacted to , and their defenses penetrated , leading to the touchdown . The coach on the ground is too close to his team in vision to see what the spotter might from being able to trace patterns , as in a diagram , from a distance . This distance from the ongoing social   scene is what you are being advised to take for structural-functional research and analysis , so you can see the patterns of the structure and functions . Architects and engineers use blueprints . These are plans of the structures with which they work . The construction workers follow the blueprints to build the structure for the " let X equal " selection of the type of unit being built , and for the desired functioning or functions . The sociologist also is helped by diagrams of groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated to visualize structure and function only in the mind . Drawing a picture can be " worth a thousand words . " It makes visible ( like an X-ray photograph ) what otherwise is there but hidden . When we diagram a group , society , or any other social organization or relationship we can visually distinguish the " groovedin " exchange relationships that create the network called social structure . Note that when we make our lines of the diagram we see , with our eyes , a structure . Study the following two simplified diagrams of houses ( Fig. 3 ) . Note that both houses are structured . If they were not structured the buildings would fall apart . If they were not structured they could not be buildings but would be rubble . If they were not structured properly there would be imbalance , and again collapse ? a destruction ? a dysfunctional event , considering the danger and costs involved . The structure , represented by the lines on the diagram that are structured to make a structure , means that each girder , beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window is so tied , related ,  | bonded to the other that they are interdependent parts , which when put together make a structure with a certain function . But it is clear that both diagrams ( structures represented ) are structured differently . They look different . Yet both are organized , meaning that each part fits in its place , in an ordered , organized , organic manner for its purpose , or function , or functioning . Both are organized in such a manner to make a certain structure . Both are structured . Both are structured differently . It is the same with human relationships . For example , two marriages may have as much in common as the two diagrams of buildings have in common . Both marriages are marriages . Both buildings are buildings . But one marriage may be diagrammed much differently than the other . The functioning of these marriages , because of different lines of interaction and exchanges , may be quite different . Perhaps one is more functional or dysfunctional than the other . The following two figures ( Figs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture class and an orchestra . Note that these are very simplified diagrams . The orchestra is certainly much more complicated than I have made it . I have kept it simple for ease of illustration , not being interested in a real orchestra here but in helping you to understand how to analyze it and other groups and how to make sense of its structuring and functioning . Note that each of these , as in the case of the buildings , look different . This is because they are structured differently . Each has a different structure .  | This different structure is visible to your eyes after you draw the component parts and the relationships . But each group is organized . If there were no organization or structure in these groups there would be a collapse , and these would no longer be functioning groups . We know that when a teacher loses control in a classroom there is commotion and chaos and the function of teaching stops . There is too little organization . The structure collapses . Sometimes a new structure is put in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned . Some students might be expelled . The principal might visit to " lay down the law , " actually to add strength to the class structure , with all lines coming from a strengthened teacher who now partially leans on the authority of the principal . There may be a rebellion in a group . There may be a mutiny . These restructure the old , perceived dysfunctional structure , a structure perceived dysfunctional by the dissidents , but not necessarily by authorities . If the old group is diagrammed , and the new one , the diagrams might look different . They have a changed structure . Both are structured . Both are organized . Structure , organization and function are with us in every group . The type of structure , organization , and function differ in groups of various types , or even in the same group at different times . A structure must develop if functions are to be performed . The structure aids the function . The function demands a structure . The Structural-Functional Perspective 2 1 1  | Change the structure and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is affected . This is because there is a system where each part is interdependent with and connected to every other part . If the structure of the orchestra is changed by removing the string section , as below ( see Fig. 6 ) , then there is another diagram which represents the changed entity . It is obviously structured differently . There is a different structure . But it is still organized . If it were not organized there would be chaos . Without the strings ? without that organic unit ? the type of music , its sound , and the nature of the human social organization will obviously be different . In other words , the function will have been affected because of the change in structure . There will be a different musical sound . Actually , by taking the strings out , as I have done in the diagram , there is no longer an orchestra but a band . The structure has been changed . Compare Figures 5 and 6 . They look different because they are structured differently . There is now a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you like band music and find it appropriate for the time and place , then you and those like you will evaluate it as functional . If you do not like band music and find it inappropriate for the time and place , perhaps for the musical composition played , then you will evaluate it as dysfunctional . In any case , when the structure was changed then function changed . If function is changed then structure changes . If you want to change the function of an orchestra to  | the function of a band you would have to remove the string section , clearly changing the structure . There is a difference between the orchestra and the band . Both are structured , but both are obviously structured differently , as can be seen in the different look of the diagrams . Both serve different functions and function differently . This has great therapeutic potential . Suppose you do not like the functioning ( behavior ) of certain people , for example a husband , wife , children or workers . Trace out the exchanges . Perceive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Question the participants about perceived wants , functions , dysfunctions , dissatisfactions , satisfactions , goals , and symbols . This is sociological research . Then restructure the diagram for better functioning . Think through the consequences of the diagrammed changes . If the changes do not fully meet those effects desired then rework the diagram again . Think again . Seek advice . Then restructure the relationship . Test the results . Change again . Remove structural variables that come between people . There should be an improvement in functioning if you have understood the symbols and the exchanges . If you fix the structure then the function is fixed . This can be done in addition to the method using equations of a relationship discussed earlier . But be careful . People are very complex symbol-making creatures . There may be unanticipated consequences . Some may be functional ( again for whom ? ) . Some may be dysfunctional ( for whom ? ) . Perhaps the people perceive the new exchanges to be unfair in new ways you did not anticipate . Perhaps the participants did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand their needs . Perhaps you did not understand . Possibly you did not ask the correct questions . Perhaps you did not make the appropriate changes . Perhaps one partner feels she " gave-in " and thus gave up too much because she acted too hastily . Labels may persist because the person has been unable to give them up , which confounds the new structure and rebuilds the old one , with the same dysfunctional effects as in the old one . A doctor of medicine does not always succeed in surgery , nor in the effects of prescribed medication . He sometimes must try and try again . Sometimes he fails because of his own limits . Sometimes there is failure to cure because of the strength of the illness which persists in taking hold again and again , attacking the structure again and again , building the same imbalances called dis-ease , despite repeated treatments . Or the patient may be uncooperative.  | There may be continued resistance to a cure for any combination of these and other reasons . There are also potentialities for failure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure to change functions , hopefully for the better , than to waste energy hating or blaming the partners in the exchanges . It is no use blaming a leg for its accident . You had best tape it , changing the structure by the elastic tape which helps support it , or use a crutch ( another restructuring ) , or go to a doctor who may splint it ( a restructured strengthening ) or who operates ( also to restructure ) . But if you do none of these things , or if you do any only to make the problem no better , or even worse , it is clearly a waste of energy to hate and blame your leg or fate for the injury . Apply the same reasoning to social ( meaning interpersonal and intergroup ) structures and functionings . Nena and George O'Neill , humanistic analysts , provide a similar lesson , in structure-function terms , about a person 's own life : In crisis , it may seem to you that your life structure is a rambling hodgepodge of disconnected , unrelated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem cockeyed , jerry-built and hardly worth saving . But you can salvage the materials and start all over again with a new design . Now , using the materials you already have in a new way , you can construct the kind of building , the kind of life , that meets your needs , your hopes and your dreams . The building blocks of the past are not wasted ; they are the raw materials out of which you build the future . But if you stand around bewailing the shape of the old structure instead of getting about the business of rebuilding it , you can waste the future . Rebuilding requires effort and courage ? knocking apart the old structures to get at the usable raw materials is uncomfortable , even painful , but when the ground is leveled and the view beyond is clear , the excitement of building anew takes over . ' It is the same with other relationships in ill-balance , in near collapse , in collapse , operating dysfunctionally . Work to restructure . In human events there are also manifest functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merton , sociologist , a manifest function refers to consequences which are recognized and intended by participants and which contribute to the functioning , adjustment , or adaptation of the unit studied . A latent function is an unrecognized and unintended consequence which contributes to the functioning , adjustment , and adaptation of the unit studied . ' The function seen at the manifest , or overt , or imme- diate level is not always the same as that which is latent , or hidden , not manifest . The manifest function of college and university training may be education . Look deeper and uncover ( dis-cover or discover ) latent functions and it might be seen that it is also a way to keep young people out of the labor market where jobs are scarce , and off the streets and busy so they keep out of mischief . It may also have the latent function of serving as an avenue for upward social mobility , thus maintaining the openness of society . Entertainment for the public and release of student aggression ( which otherwise may find an outlet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball is yet another latent function . It may teach what high school fails to teach and in essence then it provides a high school education . This is also a latent function of a college education . If these functions are recognized and intended by a participant then these are not latent , but manifest . One unit may recognize and intend something . The intent clearly might be to maintain the adaptation or adjustment of the group . The function is manifest . But other units might not recognize the connection . For these the same function is latent . For example , officials in time of strife might allow a group to visit them in a special meeting . The officials may not really be interested in what the people have to say but are inviting them for a visit so the dissidents can feel they are being listened to , thereby defusing the potential for later disturbances . The manifest function , as perceived by officials , is to allow dissidents " to let off steam , " thus maintaining the peace of the social system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something from the dissidents without having intended it , thus improving " weir relations , making for the peace . The dissidents go to the meetir ; to transmit information about their feelings and beliefs . That may be a manifest function of the social unit in the meeting . The transmission of information opens channels of communication which improves the functioning of the social system . But by talking to officials the dissidents may lose some of their pent-up feelings of hostility , which is not intended or recognized , serving the latent function of defusing behavior which might disrupt the functioning of the social system . Again , as in other aspects of structure-function analysis , we have to specify units and vantage points to differentiate between what is manifest and what is latent . Mass higher education serves the latent function of providing  | a place for hundreds of thousands of clerks , secretaries , janitors , professors , and many other specialists to earn a living . It is a place of employment for them . It also serves to support the book publishing industry . Textbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the publishing industry profitable . In addition , another latent function is that there is support of more risky publishing ventures with small markets and thus profits which are low or nonexistent . Profits from texts may pay for losses associated with these other books published . Without the profits from texts the public might not have the chance to read and learn from less popular works . Universities keep many other businesses alive , such as nearby restaurants , clothing stores , and bookstores , which is good for the economy . Think through some latent functions of your own . Make an analysis only of the manifest functions of anything and a deeper layer is missed , sometimes many layers . This is why attempts at simple restructuring , for example of a government agency , or even some words to change a sports program or to remove a college program , cause unanticipated consequences of severe negative reactions . The planned manifest restructuring which seems so simple and nonharmful may touch on many latent functions . These may be unrecognized , but they are there and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be deeply touched . They may become angry . They may use every form of power they hold to halt or sabotage the manifest change . They do not want to see changes made which will disrupt their usual functioning in life . It may not be the manifest issue which arouses concern , but the potential disruption of the latent functions . Since the latent functions are hidden but , there the people fighting against the simple manifest change oft : ' i look foolish . Sometimes they try to avoid looking foolish by marshalling all sorts of rational reasons against the change . But all those reasons are only rationalizations because touching the latent functions , as perceived , not the reasons openly expressed , is what is causing the reaction . The word " perceived " here often refers to no more than some dim realization , repressed into the deeper recesses of the mind , that their usual ways of life will be changed far deeper than what appears to be the case on the manifest level . Tell some people that the manifest function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value since it is manifestly only a game , and thus should be eliminated from the
