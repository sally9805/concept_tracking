Outrage at a professor 's death <P> For Wen-chen Chen , 31 , life in the U.S. was splendid . He had just signed a new three-year contract to teach statistics at Carnegie-Mellon University . He and his Taiwanese wife Su-jen , both certified " permanent residents , " owned their Pittsburgh house and doted on their year-old son Eric . In May , as the school year ended , Chen and his family flew home to Taiwan for their first visit since he came to the U.S. in 1975 . Six weeks into that sentimental journey , Wen-chen Chen was picked up for interrogation by Taiwanese security police and questioned for 13 hours about his " anti-Taiwan " activities in the U.S. ; the next morning his battered body-13 broken ribs , a fractured pelvis , ruptured internal organs-was found on the grounds of National Taiwan University in Taipei . <P> The Taiwan government suggests that Chen committed suicide . Colleagues and compatriots in the U.S. suspect that he was killed by the government-and fear they might be next . Says Lu Wang , 40 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case has hit us like a tornado . In every heart there is fear . The case is not an isolated instance . " <P> Chen 's death aroused congressional concern that the repressive government of President Chiang Ching-kuo maintains a web of spies , especially on campuses , to keep an eye on the 500,000 Taiwanese living in the U.S. At a hearing last week , a House foreign affairs subcommittee heard testimony that Taiwanese headed for the U.S. are warned not to speak out against the Chiang government . Most obey , aware of the ubiquitous informers . Said Iowa Republican Jim Leach : " Without question , agents of the Taiwan government have engaged in harassment , intimidation and monitoring of U.S. residents . " He called on the U.S. Government to investigate Chen 's death and to determine whether campus spies are violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act . There is growing evidence that other governments intimidate their nationals in the U.S. Last year a Libyan student in Colorado , critical of the Gaddafi regime , was wounded by an assassin . In Utah two weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taipei contend that Chen raised funds for a dissident Taiwanese magazine . Friends say he was not especially active in politics , though he believed Taiwan was overdue for democratization . It was apparently too much for his government . " The problem is you just do n't know what it takes to get on the blacklist , " says New Yorker Wang . " They 're so paranoid it does n't take much . " Says a businessman who demanded anonymity : " I still consider Taiwan my home , but I would n't go back . I do n't want to become the next Dr. Chen . "
