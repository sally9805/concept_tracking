Dogs bark in the Himalayan night . Lights flicker across the hillside . On a pitch-black path framed by pines and covered by a bowl of stars , a few ragged pilgrims shuffle along , muttering ritual chants . Just before dawn , as the snowcaps behind take on a deep pink glow , the crowd that has formed outside the three-story Namgyal Temple in northern India falls silent . A strong , slightly stooping figure strides in , bright eyes alertly scanning the crowd , smooth face breaking into a broad and irrepressible smile . Followed by a group of other shaven-headed monks , all of them in claret robes and crested yellow hats , the newcomer clambers up to the temple roof . There , as the sun begins to rise , his clerics seated before him and the solemn , drawn-out summons of long horns echoing across the valley below , the Dalai Lama leads a private ceremony to welcome the Year of the Earth Dragon . <P> On the second day of Losar , the Tibetan New Year , the man who is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . By 8 a.m. the line of petitioners stretches for half a mile along the winding mountain road outside his airy bungalow  --  leathery mountain men in gaucho hats , long-haired Westerners , little girls in their prettiest silks , all the 6,000 residents of the village and thousands more . Later , 30 dusty visitors just out of Tibet crowd inside and , as they set eyes on their exiled leader for the first time in almost three decades , fill the small room with racking sobs and sniffles . Through it all , Tenzin Gyatso , the absolute spiritual and temporal ruler of Tibet , incarnation of the Tibetan god of compassion and 14th Dalai Lama in a line that stretches back 597 years , remains serene . <P> In Tibet , he explains later , Losar used to be conducted on the roof of the 13-story Potala Palace , with cookies laid out for the masses . " Every year I used to be really worried when the people rushed to grab the cookies . First , that the old building would collapse , and second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the rich baritone breaks into a hearty chuckle  --  " now things are much calmer . " <P> It was 29 years ago last week that the Tibetan uprising against China 's occupying forces propelled the Dalai Lama into Indian exile . Yet the spirit of his ancient , fairy-tale theocracy is still very much alive in Dharmsala , a former British hill station 250 miles north of New Delhi . Here , attended by a State Oracle , a rainmaking lama , various medicine men , astrologers and a four- man Cabinet , the Dalai Lama , 52 , incarnates all the beliefs and hopes of his imperiled homeland , much as he has done since first ascending the Lion Throne in Lhasa at age four .
