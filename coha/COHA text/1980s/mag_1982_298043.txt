The Presidency <P> On a cold 1980 December night , before Ronald Reagan 's newly elected Government was in power , Richard Nixon stirred a pitcher of exquisitely dry martinis in the study of his Manhattan town house and addressed the topic of the moment . General Alexander Haig had just been rumored to be the top candidate for Secretary of State . Beneath the famous brows , Nixon 's dark eyes shone . " I know Al Haig , " he said . " He is one of the most ruthless , toughest , ambitious s.o.b.s I know . He 'd make a great Secretary of State . " <P> As the martinis took hold , and then the Chinese dinner softened some of the remaining reserve , the former President went one step further . " If Haig is running for President from the State Department , " said Nixon , " it will never work . " <P> In the alarming and perplexing void that followed Haig 's resignation last week , the belief took root that his consuming appetite for power was at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . He wanted the one position still denied him in his singular zeal to straighten out this nation and reorder the world . <P> Haig , a bundle of Jesuit rectitude and West Point ardor , rose to power through the smoldering remains of one political disaster after another . His intentions were not evil . <P> Above all , he served . <P> First , his country . Then himself . He collected the fragments of power from the dying Nixon presidency and actually ran the nation in the final gasp of Watergate . In the wimpish season of Jimmy Carter , Haig commanded NATO and flattered his way to leadership pre-eminence in Western Europe 's convoluted court life . <P> As a civilian and fledgling industrialist , he tested the presidential waters in 1980 and wisely withdrew-but not before elevating his candidacy as a prospective Secretary of Defense or State in any new Republican regime . <P> Ensconced in Foggy Bottom , Haig grubbed for turf , sniped at rivals like Richard Allen of the National Security Council and , with his singular energy , charm and connivance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a President more than slightly bewildered by the routines and realities of geopolitics . <P> Haig was always moving up , elbowing closer to the Oval Office , the ultimate source of power that nourished him . He was near but never there . Always about Haig there was the sense that as he worked he heard another bugle call , that he was girding for one last grand charge . <P> In the early mornings , as mist rose off the Potomac River , Haig often had breakfast with a guest in his seventh-floor State Department aerie , where only his soldier 's voice and the ticking of an antique clock broke the solemn silence . At such encounters , his misty ambition was freed . In this fantasy , he was on Capitol Hill putting together a practical budget , making sensible deals with Speaker Tip O'Neill and the Democrats , fashioning legislative maneuvers that made things work rather than standing prettily on ideology . His mind , in these unfettered and rare interludes , was into weapons and food and families and propaganda . His view was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believing in himself with a confidence that dwarfs normal mortals .
