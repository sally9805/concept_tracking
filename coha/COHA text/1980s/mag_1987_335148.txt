What must voters know about a candidate for President ? Abandoning his race for the White House , Gary Hart complained that he had in effect been put under a microscope and then dissected , like " some extraordinary creature . " Just so . In selecting a President , voters must judge not only a man 's resume and policies but also his character . Yet what constitutes character ? When is an inquiry into a politician 's private behavior valid , and when is it an intrusion that says nothing about his abilities ? <P> George Reedy , press secretary to President Lyndon Johnson <P> " What counts with a candidate for President is his character , and nothing shows it like his relationship with women . Here you have a man who is asking you to trust him with your bank account , your children , your life and your country for four years . If his own wife ca n't trust him , what does that say ? The press does n't invent stories about the sexual peccadilloes of candidates . Hart asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Betty Friedan , feminist and author of The Feminine Mystique <P> " Sexual behavior should be a private matter . But somehow flaunting it shows an arrogance toward women and all voters . There 's a kind of implied denigration of women , a lack of respect of the values of women . It suggests an instability that I would not want in the President . This is the last time a candidate will be able to treat women as bimbos . " <P> James David Barber , Duke University historian and author of The Presidential Character <P> " I do n't think the issue with Hart is his mating habits . It 's risk taking , it 's throwing down the gauntlet to the press . There is a temptation on the part of the public to translate politics into morals . The public can not handle intricate political issues . It can handle relatively clear questions : Is this guy honest ? Is this guy moral ? " <P> David Garrow , author of Bearing the Cross , the Pulitzer-prizewinning biography of Martin Luther King Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sex per se , but vulnerability . These things that are quasi-secret but known to some could make the man vulnerable in the exercise of power . It could give power and influence to those who know . King was aware that J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI were trying to record his affairs , but he was fundamentally defiant . He determined that he was not going to change his life . Hart 's attitude is that same defiance . But Hart is being judged by standards that at least half our Presidents would fail . If this standard is going to be applied to Hart , do you apply it to everybody ? " <P> Geraldine Ferraro , former New York Congresswoman and 1984 Democratic vice- presidential candidate <P> " The issue is not whether the press has the right to investigate . It 's what they are investigating . The public is entitled to know if he is a person who has good judgment , the right to know if he is smart , the right to know if he understands what 's going on . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his house a contra leader , then I 'd be very angry , because he has taken a strong stand against the contras . I do n't find the Donna Rice story relevant to the campaign .
