Did we really see it out there in gloomy Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia on Sunday ? Did we really see a preview of Super Bowl XV ? Well , why not ? After a 10-7 victory over Oakland , the Eagles are 11-1 and running away with the NFC . Well , maybe not running away , but they 've got a two-game lead on Dallas with four to play and they 've already clinched a playoff spot , which is nifty going for November . And the Raiders are 8-4 , one game off the pace in the AFC , against a tougher slate of opponents . // Why could n't it be ? Why could n't these two teams line up in New Orleans on Jan. 25 ? They 're as good as anybody , and certainly they showed it on Sunday . They played a classic . Not a classic by modern standards , not one of those 42-35 shootouts with footballs flying all over the place . It was a throwback , folks . It was good old defensive football , a throwback to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  before the rule makers opened the gates and let the passers in . The fans ate it up , and even the players seemed to feel they were involved in something special . // " This is my kind of football , " Philly Coach Dick Vermeil said . " I love a game like this . It tells you something about the character and intensity of the people playing in it . " // In his postgame press conference , Vermeil called it , " the greatest game our defense has ever played . " Early in the fourth quarter , after Oakland had gone ahead 7-3 on an 86-yard Jim Plunkett to Cliff Branch shocker , the Raiders ' only big play of the day , Eagle Defensive Coordinator Marion Campbell called his troops together on the sidelines . // " He does n't usually get very emotional during a game , " said 30-year-old Linebacker John Bunting , " but he said , ' I just want you to know this is the best defensive effort I 've ever been a part of . ' " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good day out there , " said Eagle Quarterback Ron Jaworski , who was 14 for 32 , with five of his passes dropped . " I guess quarterbacks get in the habit of thinking that a great game means four touchdown passes and 300 yards or something like that . But today I felt I was in a great football game . I mean for pure football . It was something I just enjoyed being part of . " // " Fun , it 's fun to play one like this , " Eagle Defensive End Claude Humphrey said . " You can go home and feel you 've done something really great . " // It was an hour and a half after the final whistle , the equipment men were almost through collecting the towels and locking the doors , and Humphrey was the last man in the locker room . Actually , the trainer 's room . Humphrey was lying on his back on a bench , his left leg elevated and wrapped in a heavy black nylon envelope , the toes encased in an inflated polyurethane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contraption , and inside it ice water was bubbling . The scene looked like an outtake from Star Trek , but it was the Eagle training department 's bow to modern science , a machine called a Jobst Cryotemp , which cools down and stimulates the sore knees of 36-year-old defensive ends . // " It 's a leg rejuvenator , " Humphrey said , smiling . " Old people love it . I twisted my knee early in the game , but I never thought of coming out . Not in a game like this . I was having too much fun . " // Three and a half sacks was Humphrey 's contribution to the cause . He 's had 13 this year . Not bad for a guy whose age lies somewhere between 33 ( Eagle press book ) and 36 ( Football Register ) . The sacking of Plunkett came early and in bunches , six in the second quarter ; all told he had to eat the ball eight times . The bulk of the pressure was applied by a sawed-off 260-pound demon named Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle position . Humphrey , whose role as designated left-side rusher on passing situations may prolong his career indefinitely , was there to collect Plunkett when he tried to escape . // The Eagles , who played a straight-up , stop-the-run defense on first downs , settled the issue of the Oakland running game very early . And when Plunkett dropped back to pass , he saw tight coverage downfield , especially by his would-be pigeon , rookie Cornerback Roynell Young . Plunkett began taking deeper and deeper drops . Then the rush got to him . The Raiders , who had been averaging 338 yards and 25 points a game , came away from the first half with zero on the scoreboard , an average of 2.8 yards on each of the 40 plays they ran , and a zilch from a 45-yard field-goal attempt by Chris Bahr. // The Eagles had done even worse . Their offense in the scoreless first half suffered from a severe case of the flutters and drops  --  70 yards total offense ( an average of 2.3 yards per play ) and four straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd been in Oakland territory for exactly five plays , all on their first series . // " With all due respect to the Oakland defense , " Vermeil said , " I felt we would have had 10 to 14 points in the first half if we had n't kept stopping ourselves . " // In the third quarter , Philly 's Tony Franklin kicked a 51-yard field goal , a monster that was gaining altitude when it split the posts . What a strange item he is . He crushes his field goals , but none of his kickoffs went deeper than the 11-yard line . Ah well , kickers .... // As the quarter ended , Plunkett threw four straight incomplete passes and the Eagle defense survived its only major crisis , aside from the 86-yarder . The Raiders , with a third-and-one from the Philly 33 , had strangely tried two sweeps , first left , then right , and the Eagles had thrown them back . // But the Raiders are like an old land mine that lies in the sand for years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one consistent trait during the 18 Al Davis years has been the bomb , anytime , from any place on the field , and with a little over two minutes gone in the fourth quarter , they launched one . First down on their own 14  --  kaboom !  --  86 yards , Plunkett to Branch . Now it was 7-3 and the Eagles ' bench was a frozen tableau of disbelief . // According to Plunkett , the play was called 28 Special , a particularly nasty bit of trickery the Raiders put in a few weeks ago . Bobby Chandler , the flanker , was lined up wide on the right side . He ran a post pattern , straight down the field , bending in slightly . Branch , slotted inside him , came underneath , running a little hitch to the outside , then took off . // " They ran it perfectly , " Plunkett said . " Bobby ran off both defensive backs free safety Brenard Wilson and Young , and when Cliff came behind him , the coverage could n't catch up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcorn State , had been the target . He was the target all afternoon . Of the 36 passes Plunkett threw ( only two to running backs ) , 13 were into Young 's coverage . Plunkett completed two , a 29-yarder to Chandler and the biggie . Herman Edwards on the right corner had only three passes directed his way . // " I 've never been tested like I was today , " said Young , who gets better every week . " I 've never had a team go deep on me so many times back to back . They showed me everything in the book , every pattern that could be shown . I guess I survived it . " // " The good thing about a game like this , " Jaworski said , " is that you can pick out a play here and a play there and say , ' This was a big play . ' They become meaningful . In one of those shootout types of games , they lose their value . There are too many big plays . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6:52 to go  --  and it was a freakie . Jaworski was supposed to run a bootleg to his left and look for the tight end and flanker , running crossing routes , but he never got that far . Randy McClanahan , Oakland 's inside linebacker , shot in clean on a blitz and flushed Jaworski to his right . // " I heard Running Back Wilbert Montgomery yelling , ' Ron ! Ron ! ' " Jaworski said , " and then the linebacker was on me . " Jaworski scrambled out of McClanahan 's grasp , and spotted an unlikely candidate 40 yards downfield , Leroy Harris , his 5 ' 9 " fullback . The pass was on the money and the Eagles had a 43-yard gain . // " I looked away for a moment , " Vermeil said , " and when I looked back I was shocked to see Ron over there on the right side . Actually , it shocked me even more to see Leroy catch the pass . " // " I have n't thrown that ball to Leroy in four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't caught it , he 'd better have kept running right out the tunnel , because Dick would n't have let him back . " // Seven plays later the Eagles punched it in on a three-yard Montgomery sweep and they had their 10-7 lead . One final sack by Humphrey shut the door on Plunkett and the Raiders . // So there it was , a defensive masterpiece with one big play on each side and the difference decided by a field goal one team could make and the other one could n't . In conquering the Raiders , the Eagles defeated an AFC team that has won 22 of its last 23 games against NFC teams , counting the 1977 Super Bowl . To those skeptics who mentioned that the Eagles ' 10-1 record going into the Oakland game was largely built on the NFL 's softest schedule , Sunday 's victory was a reminder of Vermeil 's constant refrain : " We do n't draw up the schedule , we just play it , and maybe those records are n't so good because we helped make them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games come against teams that seem playoff " bound  --  San Diego and Atlanta . Then there 's Dallas on the season 's last Sunday . // " Once and for all this should establish our credibility , " said Humphrey , " but if it does n't , then San Diego should next week . " // In the meantime , Raider Halfback Kenny King paid a sincere tribute to the Eagles . " They 're by far the best defensive team I 've played against this year , " he said , " but even more , they 're a very clean team . There 's none of this hoo-rah and hoo-ray stuff . You get knocked down , you see a couple of hands reaching down to help you up . They do n't feel like they have to practice all that phony intimidation . They 're a good defensive team and they 've got good people . " // " He said that ? It was nice of him , " Bunting said . " That 's the key , is n't it ? Good people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're not a blitzing team . Blitzing is n't sound defense . We play the run very tough and then we go into basic coverages. " // Hanging over the Eagles ' heads , though , is the shadow of two previous playoffs , the heartbreaking last-second loss to Atlanta two years ago and the roughing up by Tampa Bay last season . // There was speculation that the toughness of Vermeil 's practice regimen , his routine three-hour workouts , had taken the zip out of his players ' legs , had worn them down by the end of the season . // " No , I have n't cut down our practice time , " Vermeil said Sunday , " but maybe I 've lightened up on the intensity a bit . And there will be weeks that I wo n't work ' em that hard . That 's a change . " // Someone mentioned performances by Humphrey against the Eagles , and Vermeil smiled . Philadelphia had gotten Humphrey last year when it seemed that his best days in Atlanta were long gone , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cost two fourth-round draft choices . Vermeil 's whole thrust has been toward defense . He has always used his first pick in the draft to go for defense ( he had solved his quarterback problem by stealing Jaworski from the Rams for Tight End Charle Young , even up ) , but in Humphrey he got something special . // " He 's playing better this year than he did last , " Vermeil said . " You saw him out there today , you saw what he 's capable of . It 's exciting to me to see the way he 's been playing . One of the rewards of coaching is having the opportunity of being around the kind of man Claude Humphrey is. " // Stretched out on his back , wrapped up in his Jobst Cryotemp and staring at the collection of ancient leather helmets that trainer Otho Davis has hung from the ceiling of the training room , Humphrey philosophized about his role with the Eagles , his role in pro football . // " You know , when I retired I felt I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I would n't have gone anywhere else . I 'd seen ' em play early in the year in ' 78 and they were a young football team , but they were good . They had talent on that defensive team . Carl Hairston , Charlie Johnson .... I said , to myself , ' Hey , I can play with those guys . ' They were young and going places . At that point in my career I did n't want to wait around for Atlanta to build a team . I 'd been through that about seven times already . // " People say I 'm old now . Well , I never felt old and I never felt young . I just felt like me . I can do what I 'm doing now because I do n't have to go in on early downs and play the run . Last year when I had to go the whole way I just wore down . By the end of the season , by the time we drew Tampa Bay in the playoffs , my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for 16 weeks ... well , I do n't think I could do it now . But this way , playing 60% of the time , with Dennis Harrison playing the run and pounding on those tackles , I feel I have a lot of football left . // " You get so you can spot some things . Like the drop Plunkett took today . It was too deep . Usually when I put on a rush I pick out a certain point and aim for it , and I know when I get there I have to look back over my shoulder to see the quarterback and fight my way back to get to him . But today I could see Plunkett in front of me all the time . Those are the kinds of things you pick up from being around a while . " // It 's a good tight unit , the quality old-timers like Humphrey and Bill Bergey and the budding young stars  --  the only No. 1 drafts Vermeil has had since he 's been coach  --  Young this year and Linebacker Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working just fine .
