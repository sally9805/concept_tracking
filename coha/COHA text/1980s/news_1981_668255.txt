The struggle to come up with a new state budget for the fiscal year which began 11 days ago took a new turn yesterday when Gov . Edward J. King accused the state Senate of abdicating its responsibility to state employees and the poor by refusing to approve a stopgap spending plan . For the first time in his 30 months in office , King took serious issue with the Legislature in an unusually harsh statement delivered during an afternoon press conference at the State House . He specifically faulted the Senate for refusing to act on the $255.5 million interim spending measure containing money for state employees ' salaries and welfare benefits for July . " Not once , but three times , the Senate has failed to meet its obligations to the state ' s neediest citizens and to its employees , " he said . The Senate ' s position has been that it has postponed action on a temporary budget in order to keep pressure on the House to settle differences in the main budget . In other developments yesterday : - The legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending blueprint . - Joseph McCormack , a top aide to House Speaker Thomas W. McGee ( D-Lynn ) , said McGee expected the full budget to be presented to the House on Monday for a final vote . He said that the House and Senate had resolved most major differences . - State officials said that yesterday ' s walkout by members of Council 93 of the American , Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) had virtually no impact on state services , with an estimated 80 percent of the state ' s work force of 62,500 staying on the job . However , union officials claimed that " a majority " of its 25,000 members refused to work . Secretary of Public Safety George A. Luciano said the state National Guard remained on standby in the event staffing in state institutions fell below safe levels . In his prepared statement yesterday , King accused Sen. Chester G. Atkins ( D-Concord ) , chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee , of engaging in power politics to further his own political career . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the governor ' s own proposal , he criticized it as setting the stage for a tax increase at the same time that , he claims , it eliminates 12,000 state jobs . " It is a public relations budget , not a workable one , " he said . After King ' s statements , Sen. John W. Olver ( D-Amherst ) said the Senate was likely to send an interim budget proposal to the governor at the same time as the main budget . In that way , the governor could immediately sign into law the stopgap measure and then take the 10 days allowed by law to review the full budget . Olver predicted a more rapid resolution " if the governor weren ' t throwing bomb shells into the thing . It certainly doesn ' t speed things up . " Without the interim budget bill , King would be under pressure to sign the full budget immediately in order to pay state workers and welfare clients . But King seemed suspicious of the Senate ' s motives . " Let no one misunderstand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a situation where I have less than the constitutionally allowed 10 days to meet my obligation to review the thousands of line items and hundreds of new laws created by outside sections . " He said the Senate demonstrated a lack of " reason , compassion , humanity or concern for the commonwealth ' s neediest citizens . " The treatment ( state employees ) are receiving at the hands of power politics is totally raw . It is unacceptable , " he said . " There is no reason whatever , not even the most blatantly political reason , to fail to act responsibly ; no reason whatever to fail to end the indignities so many innocent people have suffered , " he added . State workers , retirees and welfare clients have not received checks for two weeks . The governor reiterated his firm opposition to any new state taxes . " I will not allow any inflated appropriation that will pave the way for new taxes . Really much of the past month ' s gamesmanship has been all about new taxes , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " House Speaker Thomas W. McGee and Senate President William M. Bulger resolved the principal differences in the House and Senate budgets during a series of private meetings this week . The legislative leaders compromised on $265 million in new local aid to cities and towns forced to cut property taxes by Proposition 2 1/2 and elimination of 5000 to 8000 state jobs . The Senate budget contained $300 million in new local aid and nearly 4000 state layoffs and the House budget , $246 million in new aid and 1700 layoffs . Asked if he would lay off state employees to avoid a tax increase , King replied , " I would not lay off people who are necessary to achieve a balanced budget . " Cuts must be made from a pool of 28,000 to 31,000 employees , he said .
