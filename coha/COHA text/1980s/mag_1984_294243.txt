Brazil 's thriving industry <P> The success story could have come from California 's Silicon Valley . Three young , blue-jeans-clad engineers tinkered with computer ideas in a garage and eventually designed a successful desktop machine . Their company , Scopus , grew so rapidly that by 1983 it had sales of $26 million . But this is not just another California start-up-to-success story . Housed in a modest concrete building , the eight-year-old firm operates out of a rundown industrial neighborhood on the outskirts of Sao Paulo , Brazil 's biggest city . <P> Scopus is now among the country 's largest makers of personal computers and a leader of its remarkable data-processing industry . Despite economic woes that range from a 230% inflation rate to an estimated $96 billion foreign debt , the Third World 's highest , Brazil has managed to become a thriving computer center . More than 100 Brazilian firms turn out microprocessors , terminals , printers and related products , and account for nearly 50% of the $1.48 billion worth of data-processing equipment that was sold domestically last year . As recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Brazilian market . <P> The home-grown industry was spawned by a handful of graduate students and engineering professors , many of whom had studied at leading U.S. universities . Having witnessed the American boom in personal computers , they seized the opportunity to build and sell similar machines in Brazil . <P> The fledgling designers got a big boost from the government 's willingness to bar foreign firms from producing or selling microcomputers and minicomputers in Brazil . Without such a policy , the engineers argued , the domestic computer makers would have no chance to grow . Says Scopus President Edson Fregni , 36 : " If you are an ant living next to an elephant , there is always the chance that he might step on you . " <P> Such arguments were persuasive to Brazil 's military government . " Everyone began to realize that in the future there would be those countries that were information producers and those that were just consumers , " says Colonel Joubert de Oliveira Brizida , director of the Brazilian agency that sets data-processing policy . " We knew we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club overnight , but we did n't want to be left behind completely . " <P> While they have nurtured domestic manufacturers , the government policies have also helped to jack up the price of Brazilian computers by limiting competition and access to foreign know-how . " By and large , Brazilian micro-and minicomputers are comparable to other machines on the international market , " notes Helio <P> Azevedo , president of SUCESU , a nationwide society of computer users . " The problem , " he adds , " is that the prices are too high . " For example , the latest Scopus machine sells for $6,000 , while a comparably equipped IBM Personal Computer costs $4,500.
