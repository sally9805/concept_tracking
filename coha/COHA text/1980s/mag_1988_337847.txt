The problems begin at Massawa , the Red Sea port where hundreds of dock workers labor night and day to unload grain and other food destined for Ethiopia 's hungry millions . Cranes are in short supply , as are trailers to store the grain . While wheat from the U.S. and Canada usually comes in bags , much of the grain from Europe does not and thus takes longer to unload . Grain sometimes arrives soaked with water ; a recent shipment of milk powder was contaminated by oil . <P> Beyond Massawa , the problems multiply . With truck convoys that deliver the food to regional distribution centers frequently harassed by antigovernment rebels , the government 's only solution to the problem is to close the roads  --  and no food gets through . Airlifting is far more reliable : the giant C-130s can fly across the bone-white moonscape from Massawa to the interior city of Mekele in just half an hour . The unloading crews at the airstrip are a sight to behold . " Move it , move it , go ahead forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing , " chanted a group of 15 barefoot men two weeks ago as they quickly emptied a transport of 22 tons of grain contributed by the European Community . Still , there is no guarantee that the supplies will ever reach their final destinations . <P> Two wars continue in Ethiopia : one against drought and famine , the other between government forces and well-armed insurgents . Long-suffering Ethiopians are the losers in both . In recent weeks rebels in the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre , where close to 3 million people are at risk of dying from starvation , have escalated their campaign against the government by ambushing food convoys , attacking grain-distribution centers , mining roads , firing on transport planes , and rocketing airfields . By last week the civil war had virtually halted the relief program in Tigre . Regional warehouses are mostly empty because roads are too dangerous for trucks to navigate or have been closed by the government . Says an official of the International Committee of the Red Cross : " In a month or two , we will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The irony of Ethiopia 's latest major food crisis is that only a few weeks ago international relief officials were optimistic . " This must be one of the best organized relief efforts ever , " says David Morton , operations director of the U.N . ' s World Food Program in Ethiopia . More than three-quarters of the 1.3 million tons of cereals needed in 1988 is already in the international pipeline bound for the east African nation ; supplies are assured through October . Many countries have responded to the call for help with generous donations , including the U.S. with 250,000 tons , and the Soviet Union , Ethiopia 's chief ally and a net grain importer , also with 250,000 tons .
