Q-How often should you bathe a dog ? My dog sheds constantly year-round , even though I comb and brush her daily . I also give her liquid vitamins and Pet Tabs FA Liquid with zinc , recommended by my vet . Although she doesn ' t have a flea problem , I use a flea shampoo . She ' s mainly a house pet and goes out with me on a leash for short walks . I feed her dog food such as lamb chunks , chicken , beef and veal . She gets the veal and lamb only occasionally and eats some dry dog food . Do you think the combing and brushing , her diet or the shampoo has anything to do with her hair loss ? A-A dog with a healthy coat should be bathed only occasionally . Poodles and other breeds are exceptions because they are bathed when they ' re groomed . Obviously , if your dog rolls in a mud puddle or something is spilled on her , she should be bathed . But under normal conditions , fewer baths are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor condition . Shedding , even year-round , is usually normal . The symptoms of a problem coat include excessive flaking , sparse hairs or even areas of baldness . Also , redness or other discoloration of the skin as well as any scabs or sores indicate skin problems . If a dog shows any of these symptoms , or if parasites-such as fleas or mites-are observed , then bathing is the proper treatment . However , if your dog ' s coat looks good and smells good and the skin appears healthy , you needn ' t bathe her on any regular basis . Your daily brushing is an excellent routine . Your dog ' s diet is more than adequate and is not the cause of hair loss . The vitamin and zinc supplements also mean your dog doesn ' t have a nutritional deficiency . Therefore , your dog ' s shedding is probably normal for her . In the wild , the natural trigger for wild dogs to shed is the photo period-the number of hours of light they are exposed to . Domestic dogs are inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and the lights go on , that normal physiological response does not take place . Also , shorter days in the fall tell a dog ' s system to grow a winter coat ; longer days in the spring say get rid of it . Because this change in seasons does not affect indoor dogs , they display a wide range of shedding patterns . They may shed heavily once a year or shed all year , as your dog does . A dog whose skin or coat does not look normal could have a thyroid condition or some other systemic disease . Q-I got a 1-year-old male cat from a friend . I ' ve had great difficulty training the cat to use the litter box for bowel movements . He prefers the living room carpet . However , he does use the box to urinate . I ' ve tried buying a new litter box , using different types of litter , even changing the location of the box . The vet suggested confining him at night in the room with his litter box . This has worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the cat more freedom , he slips back into his old habits . Any suggestions on how to correct this problem ? A-The first thing you need to know is whether your cat ' s bowel movements are normal in appearance . Also , how many does he have daily ? If he has several , are you feeding him on a free-choice basis ? Cats that always have access to food seem to be more difficult to house-train than those fed one or two specific meals a day . This isn ' t a cure-all , but if you ' re leaving food down for your cat all the time , you should switch to one or two daily meals . Next , get a second litter pan and , at least temporarily , put it in the living room , right on the spot where your cat has been defecating . Leave the other pan where it is . Then bring your cat to this new box frequently and praise him lavishly if he uses it . Use the same type of litter your cat has been urinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . If the cat starts using both litter pans , gradually move the litter pan in the living room out into an area you ' d prefer the cat to use . If your cat always uses the same spot in the living room , you might also try putting a dish of food on that spot . Some cats choose a second spot to urinate or defecate in , but if that becomes the place where he eats , in most cases he will not use that spot as a toilet. - Dr. Huntington welcomes questions from readers .
