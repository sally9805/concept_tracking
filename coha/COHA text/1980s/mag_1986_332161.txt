BESS W. TRUMAN <P> by Margaret Truman <P> Macmillan ; 445 pages ; $19.95 <P> One day in 1955 , ex-President Harry S. Truman found his wife before the fireplace , burning their letters . " Bess , " he protested . " Think of history . " She replied , " I have . " Fortunately , most of Harry 's letters home were spared , thereby enhancing his legacy and helping his daughter Margaret write a gentle , warmhearted biography of the addressee . Harry had to chase Bess , a spirited child of a prominent Independence , Mo. , family , for almost three decades before she would marry him . By the time he entered the White House in 1945 , she was , he wrote her , " the only person in the world whose approval and good opinion I value . " Bess was more modest . " A woman 's place in public , " she told a friend , " is to sit beside her husband , be silent , and be sure her hat is on straight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry hog the headlines and cringed at his public references to her as " the Boss . " For him , though , she was . She died in 1982 , nearly ten years after Harry , and was buried beside him in Independence . " I like the idea , " he once told the Boss , " because I may just want to get up some day and stroll into my office . And I can hear you saying , ' Harry  --  you ought n't ! ' " <P> SPIRIT OF SURVIVAL <P> by Gail Sheehy <P> Morrow ; 400 pages ; $17.95 <P> As a " new " or participatory journalist , Gail Sheehy makes news almost as often as she reports it . She has been widely criticized for writing nonfiction with composite characters and compressed time . Ten years ago , she made an out- of-court settlement in a plagiarism suit involving her best-selling book Passages . Spirit of Survival is practically all Sheehy , and that is an even bigger problem . Her effort to popularize a psychology of survival is hopelessly muddled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single mother and the companion of Magazine Editor Clay Felker , jets off to Thailand to write a story about Cambodian child refugees . There she meets Phat Mohm , 12 , an orphaned survivor of Pol Pot 's death marches and work camps . Arrangements are made to bring Mohm to the U.S. , where she lives with Sheehy , learns to be an American and attends Gail 's wedding to Clay . <P> There is a poignant story here , but Sheehy can not tell it . Her banal prose and feeble attempts at social science reduce experience to jargon . Alternating her own trendy problems with accounts of Cambodian genocide seems bizarre , to say the least . An apt subtitle for this book might be The Lotus and the Narcissus . <P> ENTER TALKING <P> by Joan Rivers with Richard Meryman <P> Delacorte ; 398 pages ; $17.95 <P> Theatrical Agent Tony Rivers came right to the point : " I ca n't send you out as Joan Molinsky . You 've got to change your name . " The struggling nightclub comic did not waste a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The single-minded doctor 's daughter from Larchmont , N.Y. , helped herself to her agent 's name , competitors ' jokes , employers ' postage stamps and free hotel rooms until her big break came on the Tonight show in 1965.
