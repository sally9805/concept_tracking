Your Dec. 13 Politics and Policy article ( " Medicare Expansion to Cover ' Catastrophic ' Ills Viewed by Many Elderly as a Disaster in Itself " ) describes a law having two quite separate and distinct components . The first is an expansion of the basic Medicare benefits of all recipients . The second , less publicized and more controversial aspect is its financing mechanism where more affluent Medicare recipients are to pay the majority of the premium for those added benefits via an income-tax surcharge . The reaction of the higher-income senior citizens to this arrangement was certainly predictable . Deserving of greater emphasis is the very limited value of the added benefits themselves . Only a small minority of Medicare beneficiaries ( estimates of 12% to 13% ) will achieve any savings from the increased benefits . Moreover , only a fraction of those will avoid true catastrophic costs . In only three eventualities may patients be spared significant costs by the new law : those who have multiple admissions to an acute-care hospital in a given year ; those who have total stays greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have physician fees and other professional expenses exceeding $5 , 000 annually are potential beneficiaries . The benefit providing partial coverage for drug expenses over $600 a year will not be effective until 1991 . The 1 , 330 members of our Senior Plan ( HMO ) represent a microcosm of nationwide Medicare recipients . In 1987 almost 10% of them had multiple admissions but only 1% had total acute hospital stays longer than 60 days and 1% had professional medical expenses greater than $5 , 000 . More important , though , we calculated that only eight of those 1 , 330 patients  --  or one out of every 150  --  would have been spared expenses of more than $5 , 000 . Only an additional dozen  --  or one out of 100  --  would have saved between $2 , 000 and $5 , 000 . Still , the cruelest deception of the misnamed Catastrophic Health Bill is not data such as the above but the fact that the bill was never even meant to address costs for those Medicare recipients most susceptible to true economic catastrophe  --  the one-and-a-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans face out-of-pocket expenses from savings of $2 , 000 a month or $25 , 000 a year , which continue until their personal assets are depleted to levels of Medicaid eligibility . Before the needs of these most vulnerable patients can be addressed however , control of the cost of the acute-care Medicare program must be constructively addressed . Neither new financing mechanisms nor repeal of the new law will suffice ; nor will further discounting professional fees , nor adopting a relative value scale for physician fees nor ratcheting down payments to hospitals . Substantive permanent progress will be made only by basic reform of Medicare ' s reimbursement of hospitals and physicians . Only if the principle of payment per unit of service is changed to payment per recipient will patients , health providers and government all have a common vested interest in controlling Medicare expenditures , and ultimately averting truly catastrophic individual costs .
