When Alberto Nunez returned to the remains of his home near the devastated town of Armero last week , he was startled to see smoke curling from the earthen hut of one of his neighbors , Maria Rosa Elvira Echeverry , 66 . A closer look revealed a miracle . Twenty-four days after mudslides triggered by the volcanic eruption of Nevado del Ruiz had laid waste to the town and killed 23,000 people , there was Echeverry , safe and relatively sound , in her partially mud-covered house . She had survived on a diet of cracked barley , raw sugar and rice . <P> Only days before Nunez discovered her , the destitute widow had run out of provisions , and was reduced to sharing a bowl of muddy water with the yellow- haired mongrel that had kept her company for nearly a month . The smoke from her fire , which she had built to ward off mosquitoes and flies , had saved her life . Rescue workers whisked Echeverry to a nearby field hospital , where doctors declared her " amazingly fit , considering her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's home . There , her rescuers reported , she was still not sure what all the fuss was about .
