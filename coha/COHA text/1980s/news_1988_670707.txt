The present theater was designed to replace one converted from a chapel for Protestant dissenters . It seems an apt provenance , because the Royal Court has often been associated with dissent , despite its incongruously exalted name and fashionable Chelsea location. // It ' s where some of Shaw ' s most combative plays were first staged , where John Osborne , David Storey , Edward Bond , Caryl Churchill , David Hare and many other subversive talents established themselves . And in recent years the theater has become a prime exporter of bold new plays , sending Churchill ' s " Top Girls " and Michael Hastings ' " Tom and Viv " to New York ' s Public Theater . Jim Cartwright ' s " Road , " now at LaMama , is a pretty typical Court product , with its scathing vision of rump-class disarray in Margaret Thatcher ' s Britain. // It was in 1904 that the Court first nudged a moribund British theater in new directions . That was when Harley Granville Barker , actor , dramatist , director and scholar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s first great dramatic renaissance . He discovered Galsworthy , he revived the half-forgotten Euripides . He staged his own brilliant " Voysey Inheritance , " Elizabeth Robins ' s feminist " Votes for Women ! " and Shaw ' s " Man and Superman , " " Major Barbara " and often underrated " John Bull ' s Other Title . " He definitively established the Irish sage as a major playwright. // Indeed , he brought the drama itself from the cultural margins and made it central , a forum where every earnest issue could be entertainingly debated . He proved the artistic value of nonprofit-making repertory , and gave fresh impetus to the campaign for a National Theater . And with the banning of his own play " Waste , " which dealt with abortion and political chicanery , Barker launched another important crusade , against state censorship. // As now , the Court became synonymous with everything progressive and anti-establishment . Shaw even dubbed its audiences " the congregation , " in recognition of a pious commitment to secular causes similar to that shared by Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons , Barker departed , and the Court became just another London theater , though one that would have its moments in the years ahead . There Shaw ' s " Heartbreak House " received its British premiere . And there important actors appeared , among them the apprentice Laurence Olivier. // Mr. Olivier went to a school round the corner , and still remembers emerging from Sloane Square subway station to see some bewilderingly painted and costumed men and women . " They ' re actors out for a breath of fresh air , " his school friends explained , " because it ' s hellish hot in that theater. " // It was an almost mystical experience for him , and helps explain his own appearance in 1928 in that hellishly hot theater . He wore some pretty bewildering clothes there , too : a silk dressing gown for Malcolm in a modern-era " Macbeth , " and a long Saxon dress as the title character in Tennyson ' s epic drama " Harold . " Even today , Mr. Olivier is fond of crying , " Oh Tostig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line he then spouted from the Court stage. // The Court became a cinema in 1935 , was seriously damaged by bombs in the war , and didn ' t reopen until the early 1950 ' s . Then , quite suddenly , came the second renaissance associated with its name . In 1956 there emerged an organization called the English Stage Company , dedicated to revivifying a British drama that had become , in one critic ' s words , " as useful to the student of life as a doll ' s house to the student of town planning . " Its third offering was a new play by an unknown young actor named John Osborne , " Look Back in Anger , " which voiced with matchless eloquence the frustration and resentment of those who saw no place for themselves in a class-ridden Britain . The impact then of its young hero ' s blow-torch rage and blistering rhetoric is even now difficult to overestimate . The British theater suddenly seemed central again , " the place to be at. " // Those are the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the Court demonstrated that they didn ' t have to be cozy drawing-room comedies about the leisured classes . He was one of many who found the range of dramatic possibility almost miraculously broadened . Plays could involve working-class Jews reacting to fascism ( Arnold Wesker ' s " Chicken Soup With Barley " ) , gypsies bringing chaos to a housing estate ( John Arden ' s " Live Like Pigs " ) , hooligans running murderously amok in London ( Edward Bond ' s " Saved " ) , a raggle-taggle crew of workers raising a tent for a wedding in Yorkshire ( David Storey ' s " Contractor " ) , old men in an asylum ( Storey ' s " Home " ) . // Though its influence was visible everywhere , the Court itself continued to justify its claim to be the " National Theater of New Writing . " Laurence Olivier , feeling his career becalmed , came to restore it by playing a seedy comedian in Osborne ' s " Entertainer . " Ann Jellicoe , Christopher Hampton , David Hare and Caryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminal pieces as , respectively , " The Knack , " " The Philanthropist , " " Teeth ' n ' Smiles " and " Cloud Nine . " Ralph Richardson , John Gielgud , Vanessa Redgrave , Paul Scofield , Peggy Ashcroft , Alan Bates - performers , writers , directors , they all came to do some of their finest work in that shabby 400-seat theater with its little box-stage. // It has never been simple to categorize the Court ' s drama . The phrase " kitchen-sink realism " was coined for it in the 1950 ' s , and could be literally applied to Osborne ' s " Look Back in Anger , " set in a dreary one-room flat . And many plays that didn ' t happen in kitchens , flats or even houses have exuded proletarian disenchantment with British society . Bond ' s aggressive reshaping of Shakespeare , " Lear , " would be an example , and his dramatic biography of the poet John Clare , " The Fool , " another. // Yet from Alec Guinness ' s " Macbeth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1980 , there have been notable revivals , too . There have been major imports , notably Athol Fugard ' s resonant reports from the South African battlefield , " The Island " and " Sizwe Bansi Is Dead . " And the Court has often demonstrated its loyalty to Samuel Beckett . It ' s where " Endgame " received its world premiere in the original French , and where Billie Whitelaw jabbered through the first performance of " Not I , " her whole self reduced to palpitating lips in a spotlight. // Max Stafford-Clark , the Court ' s director for the last eight years , thinks its prime function is to raise issues of moment , question and stir . " It ' s to insure that the British theater is a major vehicle for social debate and the examination of our society , " he says . " It ' s to provoke discussion , generally from a stance I ' d describe as nonspecific Left . " And like his predecessors , he prefers spare designs and direct , unfussy acting. // It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Center . John Osborne , no revolutionary these days , has suggested that the theater has been hijacked by closet Marxists . Edward Bond has called for the rejection of Beckett and the Court ' s transformation into a fully " Socialist theater . " Others have accused the place of being puritanical , insular , austere. // But then the theater has never been afraid of offending people , and has sometimes positively courted controversy . As in the Edwardian era , it moved effortlessly into the van of the battle against the Lord Chamberlain , the official responsible for theatrical censorship. // He was upset to hear God called a " bastard " in Beckett ' s " Endgame . " He was upset by Jean-Claude Van Itallie ' s " America Hurrah , " because of its contempt for " the head of a friendly state , " President Lyndon B. Johnson . In 1966 , Bond ' s " Saved , " whose central event was the stoning to death of a baby , proved so objectionable that the Court attempted to evade the law by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its directors from being prosecuted and fined. // The Lord Chamberlain then banned the same author ' s black farce " Early Morning , " in which Queen Victoria had a love affair with Florence Nightingale . Only the abolition of censorship in 1968 prevented all-out war with the Establishment. // Throughout its recent history , the Court has been a turbulent place . Now it ' s invaded by Fascists angered by a show critical of a right-wing British politician ; now it ' s banning a critic its directors think unsympathetic . In 1987 , Mr. Stafford-Clark attempted to stage Jim Allen ' s " Perdition , " which accused some Zionists of doing back-room deals with the Nazis , only to have second thoughts and cancel the play 48 hours before its opening . That didn ' t help Mr. Stafford-Clark ' s already strained relations with the theater ' s council of management , which this year renewed his contract only after advertising his job and interviewing several other applicants. // The Court has seen seige and civil strife , attack from outside and trouble within . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these have invariably been incurred for the best of reasons . From 1956 on , the Court has regarded " the right to fail " as an article of faith . It persevered with John Arden even though his now-celebrated " Sergeant Musgrave ' s Dance " drew just 21 percent of its box-office maximum . Recently , Robert Holman ' s " Other Worlds " played to 19 percent of capacity. // " Some plays you do because they ' re saying something worthwhile , " says Mr. Stafford-Clark , " some because it ' s necessary for the author ' s career , and some because you ' d rather die than not do them . " For him , " Other Worlds " fell into all three categories , uncommercial though it was. // Mr. Stafford-Clark says he ' ll resign rather than cease taking risks ; but he admits , " the right to fail is getting further and further eroded . " Shrinking state grants have forced the Court to reduce its home-grown offerings to four in its main theater and four in its attic-studio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few years ago . It now fills the gap with joint productions with other theaters or imports . Under a reciprocal agreement with the Public Theater , the Court has sent New York Ron Hutchinson ' s " Rat in the Skull " and Caryl Churchill ' s " Serious Money , " and brought back " The Normal Heart " and " The Colored Museum , " among other productions. // Everyone agrees that this is an instance of artistic benefit coming from financial difficulties . But there ' s a growing gap between the Court ' s $1. 6 million income and its expenditure , even when it achieves its aim of selling an average of 60 percent of seats . Less happy expedients may become necessary. // To diminish the theater ' s own production quota still further would , in Mr. Stafford-Clark ' s words , " destroy our editorial identity and reduce us to a booking agency . " Another possible if scarcely thinkable option is the closure of the Theater Upstairs , the place where new talent can be tried out and nurtured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in 1972 . There " The Rocky Horror Show " received its world premiere a year later . " Road " opened there before moving to the main theater. // As it is , the Court has cut costs as far as it dares . There ' s much doubling of roles in plays with sizable casts . Production budgets are rarely much more than $100 , 000 . The weekly maximum for any actor is $280 . People work from desks in converted passageways and , in one notorious case , actually inside a broom closet . A visitor to Mr. Stafford-Clark ' s tiny office is likely to be seated on a chair used in " Tom and Viv , " which was subsequently gilded for a later production. // All this explains the appeal for $1. 4 million , which is supposed not only to finance rebuilding and refurbishment , but also to wipe outt a production deficit expected to be $150 , 000 this year . This appeal will be launched next month ; but past experience suggests that the sum will be hard to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had trouble getting money from business and wealthy individuals . When Mr. Stafford-Clark tried three years ago to add to a Public Theater gift of $50 , 000 , he was reduced to writing to the London theater critics , soliciting alms . In any case , the $150 , 000 deficit will probably recur or increase in 1989 and the years beyond. // It would be a pity if the Court ' s centenary were followed by its contraction or even collapse . Its potential for achievement remains . For instance , no English theater has done more for women playwrights , Louise Page , Sarah Daniels and of course Caryl Churchill among them . For instance , no English theater has presented more , and more interesting , plays dealing with the interminable Ulster problem. // But then the Court can always be relied on to uncover talent and deal with difficult subjects . This year alone has seen a new play by Howard Barker , culminating in the eating of a Christlike character by his followers , and another by the equally contentious Howard Brenton , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission right now. // Love or hate it or both - the only impossibility is indifference - the Royal Court seems determined to keep the British theatrical renaissance very much alive. //
