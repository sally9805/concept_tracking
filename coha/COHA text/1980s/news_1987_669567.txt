Much attention focuses on the Porcupine caribou herd , the largest in the US , whose annual trek across the continent is a source not only of wonder but of food , clothing , and livelihood to many native peoples . But many other creatures depend on this fragile swath of permafrost as well - polar bears , brown bears , musk oxen , wolves , wolverines , Arctic foxes , seals , 108 species of birds , and numerous species of fish - and together they display the magnificent pageantry of life in this hostile and delicate world. // // Although the term ' ' wildlife refuge ' ' is arguably a misnomer where animals are hunted and habitat disturbed , here it speaks with forceful eloquence . Of the more than 1 , 000 miles of Alaskan coastline above the Arctic Circle , the 100 miles of ANWR coastal plain is the only coastline not now available for commercial exploitation . This , indeed , is a last , true refuge for Arctic wildlife in America. // These facts are beyond dispute . But if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their way , even this last haven will be sacrificed to the insatiable thirst for more oil . True to form , they tell us we can exploit this distant , sensitive land for all its industrial worth without disturbing the wildlife that has inhabited it for millennia . If the two fundamental assertions of development forces were true - that the coastal plain harbors vast oil resources and that they could be developed without risk - their argument might be compelling . But their assertions are at best highly speculative , and at worst deeply in error. // Is there a lot of oil beneath the coastal plain ? The most honest answer is that no one knows . Only the most preliminary geophysical work has ever been conducted , and only one well has ever been drilled . But a legally mandated draft study issued by the Reagan administration itself provides some insight. // In Alaska especially , it matters far less how much oil is ' ' in place ' ' than how much is economically recoverable . Alaskan oil is extremely expensive to find , produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then only under favorable economic conditions. // So , tucked away in the footnotes is the real news of this bullish report . Even if we had oil prices of $33 per barrel and 6 percent inflation , there would be an 81 percent probability that no economically recoverable reserves of any amount will be found on the coastal plain . Even if we are lucky enough to hit on the 1-in-5 chance that we might find any such reserves , the strongest likelihood is that we could produce only about 6 percent of Prudhoe ' s 10 billion barrels ; odds of producing about 25 percent are about even. // It is outrageous for an administration that has actively engaged in dismantling a broad , sensible energy policy to claim that we need to open this area up in the name of national security . If our national security is at stake , why has the administration destroyed funding for conservation and alternative energy strategies , pushed hard for relaxation of fuel economy standards , vetoed legislation to set energy efficiency standards for major appliances , and opposed many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would replace the energy that could conceivably be produced from ANWR ? // Whenever constructive steps like these are proposed , the Reagan administration always says there is something more important , from budget cuts to free-market theories . When it comes to private development of public resources , however , the US has an energy crisis. // Industry also has a way of continually arguing that the one area it is restrained from exploring is the one area where it really has to explore . It was not long ago that Congress was told in no uncertain terms that to restrict activity in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to the west of Prudhoe Bay was unthinkable because of its vast potential . A few years and a few dry holes later , NPRA is yesterday ' s forgotten energy cookie jar. // Perhaps you think that even another drop of oil is worth it if it can be produced without risk to the environment . Certainly , the industry is not shy about pointing to its record at Prudhoe Bay and issuing assurances that all will be well in ANWR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coastal plain is a much narrower strip between mountains and sea and provides habitat for far more wildlife than Prudhoe. // Moreover , the industry has had only some 15 years ' experience with wildlife in the Arctic . To come to grand conclusions about the long-term effects of development on wildlife from such a brief period is self-serving and foolish . Recently published studies of wildlife populations around national parks in the Lower 48 provide very sobering data on the damaging effects of even simple human constructions - fences and roads - over periods of 30 to 50 years. // And again , the administration ' s own report offers data that damn the conclusions they seek to draw from it . For example , the report estimates that 20 to 40 percent of the Porcupine caribou herd would be eliminated or disturbed by development . Yet the administration argues in its conclusion that all effects on wildlife can be mitigated . Similar destruction of other species could be expected , according to the administration report. // We would not think of putting dams in the Grand Canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chances of producing useful energy this way are 100 percent . Before the developers convince me that we should take an enormous gamble with the one-of-a-kind resource we have on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , they are going to have to come up with far better policies and arguments. // //
