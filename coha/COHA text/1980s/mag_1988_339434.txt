While diplomats tinker with timetables for troop withdrawal , Angola bleeds . Negotiators from Cuba , Angola and South Africa are inching toward a detailed accord to send Cuba 's 50,000 soldiers home and institute long-promised independence for Namibia . But an agreement on the terms , expected next week in the Congolese capital of Brazzaville , will bring no peace to Angola , whose people have known nothing but war for 27 years . The departing foreigners will leave behind a land glutted with weapons and a Marxist government still at war with the 60,000 homegrown rebels known as UNITA . <P> Nowhere is the misery of Angola 's civil war more palpable than in the provincial capital of Huambo . Lavender-blossomed jacaranda trees line the streets , but many buildings are pockmarked by shellfire and bullets . At a health center , one-legged children push themselves on wooden trolleys while waiting for fresh supplies of artificial limbs . Most became amputees the same way as Fernando Segunda , 16 : his right leg was blown off when he stepped on a land mine . <P> Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war 's legacy : a state-of-the-art government air base bristling with the latest Soviet-built MiGs , tanks , radar , antiaircraft missiles and camouflaged bunkers . Angola is the tenth largest importer of arms in the world . <P> The civil war erupted in 1975 as Angola achieved independence after an anticolonial struggle against Portugal that had begun in 1961 . It has killed more than 100,000 Angolans , wounded tens of thousands and cost the country as much as $23 billion in war damage , lost crops and lost diamond-mining revenues . And the killing may just keep going on . <P> The regional peace accord for southern Africa , which was mediated by the U.S. , is expected to require the Cubans to depart within 24 months , possibly starting with a partial pullback behind the 13th parallel . During that time , South Africa will gradually remove its troops from Namibia and permit implementation of the ten-year-old U.N . Resolution 435 calling for the territory 's independence . The accord is expected to be signed by the U.S. , South Africa , Angola and Cuba at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord leaves Angola 's underlying dispute unresolved : the tribal conflict that pits some 310,000 fighters loyal to Marxist President Jose Eduardo dos Santos against Jonas Savimbi 's tenacious UNITA guerrilla movement . <P> If anything , Angola 's civil war is getting hotter . With Cuban aid , Angolan forces last week pushed an offensive into the heartland of Savimbi 's Ovimbundu tribesmen . The troops captured three towns in central Angola , including Savimbi 's birthplace of Munhango . <P> But the drive has hardly daunted UNITA . Thanks to years of support from South African troops , bases in neighboring states and U.S. military aid , including potent Stinger antiaircraft missiles , Savimbi 's men seem as determined as ever . They roam freely in 16 of Angola 's 19 provinces and constantly launch deadly assaults on government soldiers . UNITA , Savimbi claims , has enough arms and money to go on fighting for two more years .
