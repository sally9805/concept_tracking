Teach-ins on nuclear arms <P> What a waste it would be after 4 billion tortuous years of evolution if the dominant organism contrived its own self-destruction , " Carl Sagan , popular guardian of the cosmos and professor of astronomy at Cornell , told a crowd of 2,000 in Ithaca , N.Y . " We are the first species to have devised the means . " George Kistiakowsky , an adviser to President Dwight Eisenhower who had worked on the Manhattan Project , told a Harvard audience : " If I knew then what I know now , I never would have helped to develop the bomb . " At U.C.L.A. , Governor Jerry Brown declared : " It 's possible to turn the arms race around by changing public opinion . " <P> Peace activists set about doing just that last week at Veterans Day teach-ins on 148 campuses across the country . The convocations were organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists ( U.C.S. ) , a group that for twelve years has fought for safeguards in the atomic-power industry and has now turned its efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as diverse as the National Council of Churches , the Council on Economic Priorities , and Physicians for Social Responsibility helped attract large audiences for speakers such as former SALT Negotiator Paul Warnke , former Tehran Hostage Moorhead Kennedy , and Democratic Senator Gary Hart of Colorado . <P> The movement these people represent , made up of an amalgam of professional groups , is nowhere near as vocal as the current wave of pacifism in Europe or as dogmatic as the unilateralist ban-the-bomb protests of the ' 50s . Said Hart : " If it grows into a unilateral thing , that would not be useful . We are talking here of responsible arms control . " Nor were the seminars a replay of the rallies of the Viet Nam era . " During the 1960s we were concerned about our boys who were dying overseas , " explained U.C.L.A. Philosophy Professor Don Kalish . " Now I 'm concerned about myself . It 's much closer to home . " The discussions were sober and sobering , providing a detailed depiction of a nuclear holocaust . Said Howard Hiatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think the medical realities are not clearly appreciated by those who talk about winning or surviving a nuclear war . " <P> The teach-ins generally did not address the complexities of the strategic struggle with the Soviet Union , or that country 's own massive buildup of nuclear weapons . Yuri Kapralov , a counselor at the Soviet embassy , told a crowd in Boston : " I wish your leaders would talk as clearly and forcefully for peace as ours do . " Said Jeffrey Knopf , a Harvard junior : " We 're simply asking the Government to call the Soviets ' bluff . The U.S. has n't even matched the Soviets ' willingness to talk . " <P> Few of the teach-in panelists discussed the point that , for a decade or more , the Soviets have shown a marked willingness to build up their military establishment . Even so , the Veterans Day turnout seemed to indicate that the Administration is losing a propaganda battle .                    @
