U.S. plans oil embargo <P> Ever since the Reagan Administration marked Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi as a foremost enemy , the U.S. pur chase of Libyan oil has seemed strangely inconsistent . Oil is virtually Libya 's only source of wealth , and the radical strong man has been using profits to train terror ists . One consideration was that some 2,500 Americans in Libya could have been seized by Gaddafi , creating an Iran-style hostage crisis . <P> Last week Reagan infor mally approved a recommen dation that imports of Libyan oil be banned and that sales of American oil-drilling equipment to Libya be cut off . The action was now seen as feasible for two reasons : 1 ) after repeated State Department warnings , the number of Americans in Lib ya , mainly with oil companies , has been cut to fewer than 400 , and those apparently refuse to leave ; 2 ) the current oil glut makes it easier for the U.S. to replace the 120,000 bbl. per day ( 2% of U.S. oil imports ) it has been buying from Libya and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount ( 1 3 % of its oil exports ) elsewhere . -
