In his 1979 movie Real Life , Albert Brooks plays a documentary filmmaker who spends weeks living with a " typical " American family , filming their every move . But his cinema-verite opus runs into trouble , and he decides to salvage it by creating a blockbuster ending : he sets their house on fire . So what , he reasons , if his real-life film suddenly turns fake : " What are they gon na do  --  put me in movie jail ? " <P> Well , no one is about to be thrown into TV jail , but a new batch of shows is playing ever faster and looser with the line that separates fact and fiction . These specimens of " reality TV " come in two varieties : those that try to fashion drama out of real life and those that try to make drama look like real life . As the real and the fake get harder to tell apart , ethical and aesthetic questions get trickier . <P> Exhibit A is America 's Most Wanted , the new Fox network series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lam . Each half-hour episode showcases two or three crimes , with the emphasis on brutal rapes and murders . Witnesses and law-enforcement agents are interviewed , and the crime is shown in a dramatized " re-creation . " Viewers are then urged to phone in any information on a toll-free hotline , while investigators stand by to pursue leads . Since its Feb. 7 debut , 13 suspects profiled on the show have been apprehended . <P> This is not the first time TV has ventured into real-life crime solving . NBC 's occasional Unsolved Mysteries specials , for instance , have presented similar crime re-enactments ( and helped catch five suspects ) . But doubtless , what makes America 's Most Wanted the highest-rated show on the Fox network 's schedule is the tabloid sensationalism of its crime dramatizations . The hand- held camera , slow-motion scenes of violence , and point-of-view shots of the victim cowering or the murderer attacking might have been lifted straight from Friday the 13th . Equally unsettling is the juxtaposition of these lurid minidramas with the appearance of actual witnesses and victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Were it not for the show 's crime-fighting credentials , this might be called exploitation . <P> The video-verite style of America 's Most Wanted is duplicated in The Street , a fictional series about Newark cops on the beat . The wandering camera and washed-out color give the syndicated show a home-movie look , and the plotless half hours are filled , realistically , with long stretches of small talk . But there are also silly interludes of outrageous comedy ( a pair of cops cleaning up vomit in the backseat of their squad car try to figure out what the " little yellow things " are ) and a rather smug assumption that anything the camera records , no matter how drably " real , " is worth watching . It 's not .
