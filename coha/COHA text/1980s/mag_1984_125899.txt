Like many a dyed-in-the-woods bird hunter , I 'd never had much use for skeet . The clay pigeons used in skeet , I 'd sneer , just are n't the same as the real thing . Unlike a wily , wary game bird , the clay flushes when you tell it to , flies the same straight , smooth trajectory almost every time out of the box and goes to pieces  --  literally  --  at the touch of a single shot pellet . A clay never runs circles around your gundog , or takes off in a heart-stopping roar of wings just when there 's a tree between your gun muzzle and its escape route , or rips you to tatters by flushing when you 're all hung up in a brier tangle . It never runs and hides in a hollow tree or a stone wall , or dives like a wounded duck to the bottom of a pond and holds on with its bill until you 've gone . And you ca n't eat a clay pigeon , not unless you have a taste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worse still , to the loner mentality of the bird hunter , skeet always seems like a gun-toting version of country club golf . Adherents of both skeet and golf display a special fondness for fancy clothing and equipment . Many skeetshooters sport WINCHESTER 50 STRAIGHT badges and fancy Bob Allen vests and carry overpriced shotguns  --  ostentatious , not to mention rather cliquish , suburban , exclusive and expensive . Oh , a round or two of skeet as a warmup for the grouse or waterfowl season is all well and good , but no one would want to make a habit of it . Or so I once believed . // Then last spring , at the invitation of a skeet-addicted friend , I sampled the game , just to see what it was like . Not only did I learn that my earlier opinions were wrong , but also within two rounds I was hooked . Skeet , I learned at the expense of many a squirming blush , is no cinch . Actually , a raw tyro who has never fired a shotgun before can master skeet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real game and , thus , brings bad habits  --  mainly a tendency to snap shoot  --  to the skeet field . // Skeet is a mentally demanding game that  --  like billiards , archery , darts , tennis or putting in golf  --  requires not merely superior eye-hand coordination but also an almost Zenlike self-discipline . Better yet , at $2 per 25-shot round and another $2.50 to reload that number of shells , it is n't as pricey as I 'd feared . // The cause of my conversion from skeptic to skeet-freak was the game itself . Skeet evolved between 1910 and ' 15 on the back lot of the Glen Rock Kennels in Andover , Mass . C.E. Davies , the kennel owner ; his son , Henry ; and their friend William H. Foster had grown bored with the straightaway simplicities of trap shooting and devised a competitive " course of fire " that , using the same gear as trap , offered different angles for each shot . They called the new game " shooting around the clock . " The circumference of a circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting stations , with the clay-hurling trap stationed at 12 o'clock to throw its birds toward six o'clock . As they moved around the circle , the gunners fired a single shot at each of two birds from each station . The leftover shell from the standard box of 25 spoiled the game 's symmetry , so the inventors added a station at dead center of the circle and took  --  or tried to take  --  the last bird as an incomer , straight overhead . In 1920 , when a neighbor opened a chicken farm adjacent to the kennel , Foster decided to cut the circle in half and add another trap at six o'clock . This not only retained the same shooting angles and spared the chickens , but it also added the dimension of " doubles "  --  two birds thrown simultaneously from either end of the field in a high-low crossing pattern . // With Foster publicizing the game through National Sportsman magazine , of which he was an editor , by 1926 shooting around the clock had caught on among gunners throughout the nation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Hunting and Fishing announced a competition to name this new sport  --  the old moniker having been deemed too confusing and cumbersome . The $100 prize went to Gertrude Hurlbutt of Dayton , Mont. , who suggested an old Scandinavian word meaning shoot . Thus skeet was born . // Today the game comes in two versions  --  American and international . In American skeet a shooter can mount his gun to his shoulder before calling for the bird , which is released immediately on the call of pull . In international skeet , the version used in the Olympics and other world championship events , the gun butt is held hip-high , and a delay of as many as three seconds can follow the call . The length of the delay is always determined by the puller . Also , international targets are thinner and harder and are thrown faster and farther  --  by some 20%  --  than American clays . In the American version , the birds are launched at some 60 mph  --  faster than most upland game birds can fly . In both versions of skeet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations  --  one an outgoer from the " high " house at the six o'clock position , the other an incomer from the " low " house at the opposite end of the field  --  followed by doubles from Stations 1 and 2 , 6 and 7 . The 25th and last shot is taken at a station chosen by the shooter . Since the crossing point of the targets is 21 yards from each station , the center station , No. 4 , being farther out on the clockface , requires the longest shot . At Station 8 , in the center of the field , the gunner gets two incomers , high and low , perhaps the trickiest shots of the round because of their sudden , straight-on appearance . Thus each shot around the clock demands a different angle and a different lead , ranging from dead-on and no lead on Low 7 to a lead of as much as four feet on crossing birds from Stations 3 , 4 and 5. // If a wind is blowing , as it usually is where I shoot , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own , sometimes scaling upward like an F-4 Phantom jet on full afterburners or , on other occasions , dipping like a Stuka on a bombing run . I 've even seen a clay undulate through the varying breeze , roller-coaster fashion . Shooting in the wind is more challenging because it more closely resembles the flight behavior of real birds . // The first time I shot seriously , at the Owlkill Rod &amp; Gun Club in Eagle Bridge , N.Y. , it was overcast and gusty . I broke only 12 birds of 25 , and the red on my face was not caused by windburn . A voice in the back of my head tried to sneer , " C'm on , it 's just a silly snob 's game . Who needs it ? " Then I looked at the other men shooting on that raw , blustery April afternoon , men in bib overalls , mud-caked overshoes , beat-up baseball caps , some carrying their shells and empties not in fancy leather cartridge pouches but in workworn carpenters ' aprons , the sort you tote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's the snob ? " // I suppose what clinched my conversion was my membership to the Owlkill club . Eagle Bridge , appropriately , is where Grandma Moses , the famed artist , spent most of her 101 years , and the men and women I shoot with at Owlkill are just as down-to-earth and no-nonsense as the folks Grandma used as subjects in her primitive paintings . No country club dandies these . The Owlkill 's 60 members include a hardware store owner , a silo salesman , two or three dairy farmers , a gundog trainer , a veterinarian , a small-town cop , a crack machinist , a computer software expert and four high school teachers . They 're rural types , even if their occupations all do n't happen to be agrarian . The needling and banter they exchange on the skeet field is endless and earthy . // The Owlkill 's rangemasters , whose word is law when it comes to safety , are a husband-and-wife team . Norman Getman , 64 , is a crusty retired carpenter who served as an infantry sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it . Norman , who constantly puffs a malodorous pipe , even while he shoots , never lets off talking , breaking doubles and bon mots in the same smooth swing . " Nothin ' to it , " he says , chortling , when the clays " smoke " for him . ( Back in the 19th century , trick shooters like Annie Oakley and Frank Butler broke glass balls filled with feathers to simulate hits on real birds . Today 's clay pigeons , when they 're " centered " in the shot pattern , explode in a puff of brown smoke  --  as satisfying to the gunner as a dead-solid perfect drive is to a golfer , or a clean open-field tackle is to a defensive back . ) " Must have left the BBs out of that shell , " he grumps when he misses , which he rarely does . " You 've got to have your excuses ready before you shoot , " he explains to a newcomer . " That 's the most important rule in skeet. " // Norman 's wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long career as a high school math teacher . A dainty , gray-haired lady who 's more at home with a volume of Euclid 's theorems than with her well-oiled Browning 20-gauge over-and-under , she 's nonetheless a better shooter than some of the club 's male members . " I taught her everything she knows , " Norman brags when Laura smokes one . " Never saw the woman before in my life , " he says when she misses . " You 've got to be careful what you say when a woman 's got a loaded gun in her hands , " he cautions . Laura smiles sweetly and blasts another double . // Among the club 's newer members is Chet Cummings of Greenwich , N.Y. , a nationally known trainer of field trial dogs who 's now retired . Since his first amateur field trial in 1928 , Chet has probably killed more real live pigeons over his canine pupils than there are Columbidae in Central Park , yet during his first few weeks at the skeet range he shot dreadfully . He 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shotgun to their shoulder , Elmer Fudd fashion , before calling the pull . Because of a cataract in his shooting eye , he was n't picking the bird up visually as quickly as he should . So he reverted to the low-gun style he 'd used as a hunter . He 'd hold the shotgun at port arms position until the clay had been launched , and then , when he could see it , he 'd quickly raise the shotgun and  --  pow !  --  smoke the clay , as he had so many live birds over the years . His scores climbed from the low teens to a respectable 20 or more of a possible 25. // " The worst enemy on the skeet field is a break in routines , " says Abb Wiley , 68 , a quiet , almost scholarly maestro of the .410 gauge who serves as Owlkill 's unofficial guru . " It 's got to feel so natural  --  the mounting of the gun , the swing , the shot coming almost as a surprise  --  that you do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed from their early abyss to a decent 20 or 22 as I learned the routines of the skeet field . Then suddenly they fell off again , slumping lower than I 'd shot at the beginning . Abb watched me through a round or two . " You 're pointing your toes too far to the left on those high-house birds , " he said , " so when you try to swing through you 're forcing it . Bring ' em around over here . " I shifted my stance roughly three inches to the right , and was back to my best scores . // Still , I 've yet to " go straight "  --  break 25 birds in a row . It 's a bit humiliating . Last year only one Owlkill member had achieved that baby step on the way to skeet greatness , but this year it seems everyone except me has done it . // I look for clues in their styles , but there 's no unifying principle . Tom Burnside , the jolly , almost Pickwickian computer consultant who wooed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strutting partridge as he calls for his bird , but that technique does n't help me . Howard Slocum , the silo salesman , stands straight and slim as a teenager , so solid in his swing that not a hair of his graying mustache twitches as he pops a tidy double . Reggie Tschorn , the veterinarian who once shot on the U.S. Army skeet team , crouches , postures , purses his lips and seems to spring at the bird as he shoots . Bob Coombs , a high school English teacher , stands pigeon-toed , slumped , with the gun stock tucked tight between chest and biceps as he awaits the flight . Butch Von Haggin , a cop who bears an uncanny resemblance to motor racing 's Dan Gurney , seems to glare the pigeon to pieces with his ice-blue eyes . Stance , swing , psyche , I 've varied them all . // Too often I hear Norm 's voice as a missed bird soars off unchipped into the distance : " Quack , quack , quack ! You want the dog to fetch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall how our stern-eyed superstar , Ray Wrubleski , broke 125 straight this summer to lead his team to the club 's intramural league championship , I 'm inspired to try again . And again and again and again . After all , I 'm a skeet junkie now , and I really do n't have much choice .
