few of the girls were women , twenty-five and twenty-six years old , but no less fearful for their longer sojourn on this Holy Russian earth . Alexander Sergeievichwas nodding drunkenly at his table when he noticed the girl at the end of the line as they danced across the floor . His stomach knew a funny feeling as he stared through the haze of smoke and the smell of opium . His eyes were burning . There was something strangely familiar about this woman of the flaxen hair and the diaphanousblue eyes of burning ice , the way she moved and was constructed . Where had he seen her before ? Known her ? He tried painfully to put the woman in the time and space of his experiences . At the Lycee ? Hardly . With the Hussar Guards ? Her frightened face was on the tip of his memory , playing games with his remembrances . He had known so many women in the brief span of his stay on this Russian earth . Natasha ? No ! Alexandra ? No ! Marya , Olga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course Tanya ! Tatyana , his first love , the chambermaid in Moscow . Now he was completely awake and leapingly alive . He sobered instantly . What was she doing in this Godforsaken hole ? He 'd known that she 'd long ago escapedthe poverty-stricken aristocratic Pushkin household . But Saint Petersburg ! And this decadent cabaret which had the worst reputation in all the city . He could hardly contain himself . Now the drunken ennobled men were slapping ten and fifteen ruble bills upon the table , and girls were dancing through the opium fog up to the tables and liftingup their dresses and squatting over the bills , and when they moved away the rubles had disappeared as if their vaginas were constructed with built-in suctions . These miracles of dexterity were accomplished to the frenzied applause and squeals of the ennobled gentlemen and ladies . Count Stroganov took a ruble out of his pocket and called a waiter to his table , who lit his cigar and then set the ruble aflame . The Count took a ruble gold piece from another pocket and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed as red as fire . He was a hulk of a red-faced man , massive and fat-faced from overindulgence , over-eating , over-drinking , excessive debauchery . He lit anotherpaper ruble and held it to the coin till it was flaming red . He belched loudly . He placed the glowing coin upon the table and motioned to the last girl in the line . The coin had been so hot it burned his glove . She danced toward the table and squatted over the coin . She screamed , pitifully , as she leaped away from the table . The Stroganov table erupted now with laughter and applause . But the girl lay on the floor groaning . Alexander Sergeievich sprang from his chair and ran toward Tatyana followed by his friend , the medical student . Tatyana had passed out , but when they lifted her dress they saw the hot coin still in place . Her pubic hair was scorched and darkly crisp . Alexander Sergeievich took the coin from Tatyana . It burned hotly in his hand . The medical student attended her as Alexander Sergeievichturned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Which one of you bloody bastards is responsible ? " he asked  |p101Benkendorf  said , " Careful , boy . Watch your tongue around the aristocracy . " The Secret Policeman was a slimly-constructed distinguished looking gentleman with receding forehead , thinly mustached , with small intelligent eyes . " You have the privilege to be speaking to an aristocrat , " Pushkin told him . " And now I repeat : Which one of you sons or daughters of a bloody pig is responsible ? For I am a gentleman , Sires . And I will have satisfaction . " Count Stroganov spoke up , jovially , " Oh well , if you are a gentleman of the aristocracy , what are you so upset about ? She 's a mere serf girl of no particular account . " He was a highly educated man , one of the most literate gentlemen at His Majesty 's Imperial Court . And he was thoroughly decadent . " She is a woman and a human being , Sire , who once worked in the household of the Pushkins . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Since you cowardly bastards will not speak up , I will have satisfaction from either or both of you , separately or simultaneously . " He deliberately took off the glove from his right hand and resoundingly slapped Stroganov and then Benkendorf . " You have the honor of being addressed by Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin , at your service . " Stroganov 's face turned the color of a carrot , as he sprang from his seat . But Pushkin turned his back and went to see after Tatyana , who was slowly gaining consciousness . " Is it very bad ? " he anxiously asked Vasili Needleman . " It is not good , " Needleman replied . " She should be in a hospital . " Tatyana was fully conscious now . " Oh no ! " she cried . " I do n't have rubles for a hospital , Your Excellencies . And besides , I have to work tomorrow night and they might keep me in that place ! " Her blue eyes filled with terror . He covered her nakedness with her dress . Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at this hell-hole-of-a-cabaret , she would not be losing anything of value , but what alternative could he offer her ? He could hardly maintainhimself on the rubles graciously bestowed upon him by the generous Emperor . And his family was among the most impecunious aristocrats in all of Holy Russia . Nevertheless he said to the medical student , " Take her to the hospital in my name . I will take care of the expenses . " Tatyana said , staring bleary-eyed at her benefactor , " But who are you , Your Excellency ? " Her eyes were heavy with suspicion . " And is your memory so short , Tatyana ? Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin ! At your service , Madame . " Her whole face smiled . The eyes , the lips , the cheeks , the teeth , " Sasha ! My own darling baby , Sasha ! His Excellency ! " She took him in her arms and the tears spilled down her cheeks . " Such a gentleman he has become ! " The wheels at the Czarist court turned swiftly . Dueling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander Romanov and Benkendorf , except in special cases where it would be advantageous to the court to be rid of some notoriousIvan Ivanovich or anti-monarchist . No matter . Duels were fought weekly , sometimes by the day . This time the Emperor took no chances . Alexander Pushkinp102was too dangerous a duelist ; Stroganov and Benkendorf too valuable to the Court . There would be other ways of dealing with this irreverent rascal . The Emperor would bide his time.  |p103Alexander  Sergeievich Pushkin seemed determined that the Emperor would not have much time to bide . Even so , the Emperor used his omnipresence to make sure no duel took place . Alexander Sergeievich raged in his terrible frustration . Bored with the corrupt life he was leading , which was not much different from those around him whom he disdained , he was filled up to the brimming overflow with self-loathing and contempt . The Cricket and his comrades of the Green Lamp knew all the institutions of ill repute in Saint Petersburg and were on speaking terms with every madam in the numerous houses of prostitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , suddenly it was spring . And the sap was in more flow than ebb in the poplar and the linden trees , the evergreens of fir and pine and cedar . The thaw of winter 's frigid blast was ebbing ; there was a brand new smell in the air above and all around in old Saint Pete . Some thought of it as new Saint Pete in relationship to Moscow , which was still the ebb and flow of Russian life . Pushkin longed for his remembered Moscow . Moscow of the palaces of Emperors and baronsand counts . Moscow of the hundreds of bazaars , of the thousand churches and cathedrals and sharply-pointed cupolas , Moscow of the mighty Kremlin , citadel of Muscovy and the Russian spirit ! Released from their winter prison , people thronged the streets again . The very proper nobility rode in finely appointed troikas and carriages that splashed the **29;16681;TOOLONG upon the common everyday pedestrians , as if the mud and slush were kopeks thrown graciously to the unwashed undeserving multitude . The sky above Saint Pete was cast in mauve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an open-air barouche owned by young Boris Rahinovsky . Inside , the carriage was garmented in the luxury of Russianp104mink . The poetry in Pushkin 's mind stared behind the mud-splattered faces of the street people , the beggars , panders , hard-laboring honest-to-goodness working people , hustlers , whores , petty tradesmen , as they bowed and scraped and spoke pleasantriesabove their sycophantic breaths . " The best of the morning to Your Excellencies ... . Your Noblenesses . . . Your Highnesses .... " " May the Holy Virgin always bless you . " His poet 's ears happily heard obscenities underneath those sullen smiling breaths . More than likely it was his imagination forever taking poetic license . For how could smiling people be unhappy ? Everyone , especially the wealthy , knew that most of the blessed poor were happy and contented with their lot . The tenderheartedson of the Holy Virgin Himself had said , " Blessed are the meek . " On a sudden impulse Alexander Sergeievich leaped from the open carriage as it meandered slowly through the throng of the people-of-the-street . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people like a chameleon . He left his hat in the carriage as it clattered along the cobblestoned boulevard . " Where is Alexander Sergeievich ? " his comrade Ivan Pushchin asked excitedly . " Where did the Cricket disappear to ? " from Prince Vyazemsky , uneasily . Basil Zukovsky said , " It is not safe out there among the rabble . " Alexander Sergeievich suddenly loomed up out of the multitude and came up to the carriage . He bowed obsequiously to his astonished comrades . " May you live forever , Your Noblenesses , " he said softly to them . Then hemuttered audibly , YOU MISERABLE SONS OF YOUR GONORRHEA-INFECTED MOTHER 'S MISBEHAVIOR ! " He bowed slowly and respectfully to the carriage containing his startled laughingcomrades . They shook their heads at his audacity . " Go ahead , laugh , Your Eminences , YOU LAZY , PARASITIC , GOOD-FOR-NOTHING SYPHILITIC SWINE ! " he mumbled sotto voce , loud enough to be clearly heard . The street people of the Nevsky Prospekt were taken aback at first , then snickeredhesitantly . Who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like them ? Was this one of the Secret Police 's tricks ? The hated Third Section ? This one was n't dressed much better than they were . He spoke their language and voiced the sentiments they would not dare to utter publicly . " The best of health to Your Excellencies , you miserable offsprings of filthy dungeatingpigs ! May you choke to death in your mother 's excrement ! " The street people of the Prospekt began to cheer Alexander Sergeievich now as a larger crowd began to gather . He had maneuvered himself directly in front of the expensively fur-lined carriage with its handsome well-groomed horses . He fell in front of the horses and pretended they had knocked him down . He leaped to his feet.  | " See how they treat us ! " he shouted to the gathering crowd of ragged people . Professional beggars , one-armed lepers , straggly-haired foot-sore ladies of the eveningand the boulevard , procurers , hustlers , working people . " They think more of their goddamn horses than they do of us . We should break their horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dainty legs ! " somebody shouted from the crowd . " Break their legs too ! " another shouted , as they gathered around the carriage , preventing it from moving now . Some of them had seized the reins . The ennobled comrades were no longer laughing . Mounted gendarmes moved toward the noisy gathering mob , dispersing them with knouts and cudgels . " Is everything all right , Your Excellencies ? " one of the mounted gendarmes inquired . They were no more than two versts from the Winter Palace . " Everything 's fine . Thank you very much , " Alexander Sergeievich answered . He was back in the well-appointed carriage now , underneath his top hat . " They , the people , were just expressing in their own inimitable way their great love for the Nobility and His Imperial Majesty . " The police horses pranced and snorted . The mounted gendarmes in their handsome Cossack uniforms looked about them dubiously . " You 're sure Your Excellencies are all right ? You 're safe ? " " But of course . What could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you implying that the people do not love His Imperial Majesty ? " The confused policemen saluted the carriage people and rode off again . AlexanderSergeievich shouted after them . " Long live the Russian people ! Long live the Russian politseyskii ! Long live His Imperial Majesty ! " The crowd had dispersed by now , and as they went cloppidy-clop down the mud-spattered cobblestoned boulevard , his comrades bombarded him with questions and recriminations . The rattling sound of the carriage wheels grinding and creaking into the slush-covered cobblestones made his flesh crawl . " What in the devil did you think you were doing ? " " You carry a joke too goddamn far ! " " We almost had a rebellion on our hands ! " " Just a little demonstration , " Alexander Sergeievich told them calmly . " To show you how really little you know about the true mood of the masses . And you fraudulent bastards call yourselves liberals and revolutionaries . " He laughed at the quizzical looks on their faces . His comrade , Ivan Pushchin , began to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with some of his revolutionary comrades in a house of ill repute with one of the better reputations in Saint Pete among the upper classes . " The Home for Wayward Girls " was chaperonedby a certain Madame Marya Dubinskaya , who regarded the young ladies in her charge as her adopted daughters . She was a handsome matron somewhere inp106her middle forties , sturdily constructed and well preserved for one who had labored so long and earnestly in such an ancient and honorable profession . The two-storied brothel was located on Bourgeois Street just off Nevsky Prospekt . Of woodenframedconstruction , it consisted of six large rooms on each floor , with oaken front and back stairways , a darkened hallway running down the center of each floor , with a secret back door entrance for the extra special clientele . Gaudy , gold embroidered draperies adorned the shuttered windows . Each room had its icon corner where the candles burned eternally . The first time Alexander Sergeievich had gone there , Madame Dubinskaya had taken the already-famous poet on a grand tour of the premises . Into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demi-virgins languished , hastily washed , gaudily dressed and heavily perfumed . Alexander Sergeievich 's head swam from the pungent fragrances . " These are my wards , " Madame Dubinskaya told him proudly . " I regard them as a sacred trust . Poor darlings , some of them never had a mother or father . " Alexander Sergeievich looked around at the poor little half-naked , motherless and fatherless darlings , wiggling their plumpish backsides and licking their painted lips at him . He said , " It must have been very difficult for them , coming into the world without a mother or father . " Madame D smiled graciously . She wiped a lone tear from a darkened eye . " Yes , " she said , " but they 're human beings like all the rest of God and His Majesty'ssubjects , are n't they ? Are n't they ? " she repeated . " And by the Holy Virgin and His Imperial Majesty , I have dedicated my life to see that they are always treated humanely . I 'm a Christian and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just too tender-hearted . " She took the poet to the back room on the right just off the rear staircase into a chapel complete with altar and confession box and icons of various sizes and descriptions , the candles beneath them burning brightly . Alexander Sergeievich gazed , transfixed , now at a life-sized portrait of Our Savior hanging behind the altarand staring down from his cross and crown of thorns with ever saddening eyes . A chapel in a whorehouse ? But Madame Marya Dubinskaya was a very devout lady , as she explained to the flabbergasted poet . He learned later that her young mischievous daughters called her " Ave Marya . " Not to Madame 's face , of course . To emphasize her piety , she introduced Alexander Sergeievich to the chaplain of this famous and nightly brothel , one Abbe Igor Podolinsky . " Father Igor is a very modest gentleman , " Madame explained . " But you should know that he is the esteemed assistant to the head of the Orthodox Church , who is Metropolitan of all Saint Petersburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole hierarchy of Russian Orthodoxy ! " Madame Dubinskaya had a way of speaking as if she had just completed some arduous chore and the very next breath would be her last . Listening to her , Alexander Sergeievich felt himself almost out of breath.  | " We always insist on the very best for our poor darlings , " she assured him , breathlessly . Abbe Igor was a soft-spoken man , nearing fifty years of sojourn on this Russianearth , quite obviously a glutton at the dinner table , obese and puffy-eyed and paunchy . It was said of him that when the young daughters came to him for sacred counsel , this pious gentleman would place his divine hand on their heads and sometimes other places and stare down their loosely bodiced bosoms , and usually with a few well-chosen phrases in Greek or Latin , would bless them by patting them fondly on their playful buttocks . It was further rumored by the fun-loving daughters that this Orthodox Abbe gave his blessings to " Ave Marya " in a very unorthodox fashion . It was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul that he hardly ever left her side , except when he was bestowing grace upon the girls or receiving their confessions . And that he even went to bed with her to protect her sainted soul from the devil while she slept . This particular evening , Crazy Kuchelbecker had taken a buxomy lively redhairedlassie to a room upstairs . Plump-faced Ivan Pushchin had also disappeared with another double-breasted maiden . Alexander Sergeievich sat in the front parlor with a dark-eyed full-lipped girl , no more than seventeen , pure and angelic in every aspect of her countenance . The sincerity was all there in the utter blackness of her eyes , the innocence in her generousmouth , the way her girlish pointed breasts lifted high up toward her shoulders , the way she primly sat before him , her tiny voice , her earnestness . All this spread around the girl an aura of saintliness that sharply contradicted her presence in this house of prostitution . She should be in a cathedral or a convent , he thought . Belongsin Heaven , up there with the other angels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could this pure one be a prostitute ? He was certainshe was here by some quirk of an implacable fate . He would bring her to Abbe Igor 's fatherly attention . He surprised himself when he asked her , " What 's an innocent one like you doing in this God-forsaken place ? " The question was a cliche he had read in many French romances . His face flushed with his own embarrassment . His angel answered him demurely . " This place is not God-forsaken , AlexanderSergeievich . We have an Abbe and a place of worship here . We have prayer each night after work . " He felt foolish even as he spoke . " I 'm going to speak to Brother Igor about you . We must rescue you from this place . An innocent one like you  --  " He got no further when a terrible scream went through the house . Then another , and another one after that , as if one of the poor darlings were being raped or murdered . Doors opened and slammed and many feet ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the chapel , all in various and varied states and stages of dishabille . Alexander Sergeievich almost collided with Kuchelbecker at the entrance to the back room where the uproar was continuing . Fun-loving ,  |p108red-haired  Louisa lay there naked on the bed screaming with laughter and pointing at the man bent over the bed before her , tears streaming down her appled cheeks . The man 's breeches were down around his ankles , his round , fat-cheeked backside glowing in the candlelight . " Your Grace , " she began and then went off into gales and gales of raucous laughter . " Now  --  now  --  daughter  --  just play with it a little . It will pucker up and the Lord above will surely bless you . " " But your Grace ! He 's so tiny I ca n't find him . Your fat belly 's in the way of everything  --  . " She began to laugh again , uncontrollably . " Now , now , dear daughter , the Holy Virgin will not smile on you  --  making fun of Her apostle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of him , your Grace ? How do you find him when you urinate ? " She laughed so hard she had to hold her stomach , fallingout of the bed , kicking her fine legs all about as she continued to whoop and holler . By this time the room was filled with naked gentlemen and daughters . The air was pregnant with the overwhelming aroma of cheap exotic perfumes all mixed up with the smell of body stench and very recent copulation . The room across from the chapel shook with laughter . The chubby bare-assed man turned , and it was true what Louisa said . His stomach was so fat and round it was impossible to glimpse his male protrusion . His round face reddened by the second . Our poet was thunderstruckand speechless when he recognized the identity of this noble personage . He heard , " Your Grace ! Your Holiness ! " He was no less a holy one than the Metropolitanof all Saint Petersberg . Next to the Patriarch himself , second in command of God 's holy work and mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty 's personal connection with the Great One up on High . Naked men and women went immediately down upon their knees and made the sign of the cross . Let it be said for the Metropolitan that , though his cheeks were roseate as new-bloomed roses , he did not lose his dignity as he , with difficulty , pulled up his silken breeches . He made the sign of the cross and with a proper gesture , blessed those kneeling , cleared his throat and spoke in a deep and saintly voice . " I was bestowing upon this young daughter my divine blessings , but she did not appreciate the precious gift I offered her . And for her unseemly behavior , may this ungrateful , wanton bitch rot in hell 's fire till eternity ! " By that time Abbe Igor came to The Holy one 's rescue and led him away from the band of infidels who had erupted now again with howling laughter . But the Holy man never lost his dignity . The next day he went to see Count Miloradovich , the Governor-General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ den of iniquity " be closed down at once . " It is an outrageous affront to this Holy Russian Empire ! "  | " But , your Grace , we have no evidence  --  how do you know that the one who brought this tale to you does not have some evil axe to grind against the dear woman ? " The Metropolitan did not appreciate the twinkle he saw in the GovernorGeneral'seyes . " Is n't Abbe Podolinsky her counselor ? Madame runs a school for wayward girls  --  I mean  --  " The Metropolitan was clearly agitated . " It is a danger to the morals of the youth of Saint Petersburg , and it has come to my attention  --  and if steps are not taken against this woman immediately , I shall have both of them , her and that lecherous bastard Podolinsky , ex-communicated . " Count Miloradovich promised , " I shall look into this very grave matter immediately . You may rest assured , your Grace . " But His Grace refused to rest assured . He got into his carriage and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he receivedassurances of immediate action . A few nights later the disillusioned Pushkin was again at Madame Marya 's Home for Wayward Girls , making himself at home in bed with his innocent Larissa . The innocence was still in her face , her lovely young-girl 's breasts still pointed heavenward , the imagined halo still encircled her angelic head , even as her lovely darkly cloven spot received his energetic truncheon . Even as her limbs went up to meet the challenge and she murmured softly sweet obscenities , she still had that angelic look about her . He thought , guiltily , I 'm fornicating with a saintly creature , an angel recently come down here from Heaven , and against his conscious will , he got an extra perverse pleasure from the idea of it . Just as they were about to reach those Pearly Gates together , hearts pounding like claps of thunder all the way up in their foreheads , there came a loud pounding on the doors and windows front and back . " Open up in the name of His Imperial Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alarm and screams and scrambling . Gentlemen leaping out of windows . More pounding now on doors insidethe house . Fortunately for Alexander Sergeievich , he was in a room on the first floor and did not have too far to jump . A few legs were broken that fateful night . Fortunately , also for our poet , it was not the cold of winter , due to the fact that AlexanderSergeievich left hurriedly and without his breeches . He had to walk through the cool spring night in his meager undergarments . It was during these times of his profound debauchery when he wrote , and pretended to believe : Love and wineWe need together . Without them men Would yawn forever.  |p110But  his poetry was the thing that kept him going , made him think his life worth living . As spring moved toward summer and the white nights of Saint Pete began , he immersed himself in his poetry . Night and day , the anti-monarchist , anti-cleric verses poured from his angry pen . Satirizing his pro-Czarist , long-time friend and patron , the Emperor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim-lit room and wrote : In his elegant simply told history He explains to us most objectively How autocracy necessarily came about And all the good effects of the knout . He licked the tip of his goose quilled pen and relished the taste of his bitterness . He was a man possessed . Attacking Father Lev Gregorovich Photius , a famous mystic of Saint Petersburgsociety , he wrote : Part fanatic , part pickpocketThe only spiritual weapons he wavesAre opprobrium and cross , sword and knout . And of a wealthy countess who contributed great sums to this holy mystic , he wrote : This so pious woman Has sold her soul to God , And her sinner 's skinTo archimandrite Photius . Alexander Sergeievich made enemies by the hundreds amongst those in powerfulplaces . He went to visit Tatyana at the hospital but she was no longer there . He raised hell at the cabaret where she worked , but to no avail . He looked all over the city for her , but it was as if she had been kidnapped from the planet . Every time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incident with his Tatyana at the cabaret , he flew into a trembling rage . At home he worked far into the dim-lit night . He thought that if he could not take it out on a field of honor , then he would have his satisfaction with his pen and paper . He would do combat with the cruel monarchy through his writings . He would burn the pages up with the inflammation of his verses , even as his own eyes burned with sweat and anger . But to write against the throne was to curse the Good Lord up above , to dare the thunder and the lightning . He had this strange trembling fascinationwith personal disaster , as if he somehow knew it could not come to him . Death seemed to have no terror for this enraged poet , not even far away Siberia.  |p111One  evening he went to a party and met Countess Oshnikovna , a low slung , darkly-mustached , Hat-chested woman of middle age , a self-proclaimed apostle of Father Lev Gregorovich Photius , both of whom Pushkin had written about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wild-eyed woman followed Alexander Sergeievich around the brightly-lighted drawing room . " I have read all of your poems , Monsieur Pushkin . I am a great admirer of your work . But you are grievously mistaken about Father Lev Gregorovich . " The little mousy woman had Alexander Sergeievich cornered now . Her highpitched voice verging on hysteria . Alexander Sergeievich tried to modulate the woman 's voice by speaking softly to her , but the softer he spoke the louder she became . " I love your work , " she shrieked . " But Lev Gregorovich is an angel sent to earth by the Holy Virgin Herself . Ask him . He will tell you . He  --  " He could vaguely hear the music of a serf band playing at the other end of the vast drawing room . What was he doing in this place ? He should have been home working . " Madame , " he said , " Madame Oshnikovna , I have no doubt that Father Photiusis on speaking terms with the Blessed Virgin . However  --  " She had not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Father Lev has also read your work . He 's anxious to meet you . He adores you . We are having a soiree at my home next Tuesday evening . Please say you will come and meet this great Messenger of God . He loves your work . He 's an angel and he even forgives you those mischievous poems about him . And I forgive you too . " Alexander Sergeievich looked around into the ennobled faces , looking desperatelyfor a way to escape this mad woman whose eyes were flashing fire , her thin wet lips quivering . She had worked herself up into a wild excitement . " Say you will come , dear boy , and I will send my coach for you . " She simmereddown . She was all soft and sugary now , cooing gently , though the crazy gleam still lingered in her eyes that were forever changing colors . She took his hand and began to caress it tenderly . " It 's only fair , my darling . After that sacrilegious poem you wrote about the dear man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive you , because we love you . " She patted his hand . " There now , there  --  it 's settled then . My coach will call for you at seven o'clock on Tuesday evening . When Alexander Sergeievich arrived that Tuesday evening at the Countess 's palace , night was falling . You could almost hear it coming down , with frogs and crickets croaking and giggling . It was early autumn and had rained all through the morning . Then the rain ceased and the leaves began to fall , turning golden brown all over Saint Petersburg , turning orange , turning scarlet as if all Russia were aflame . It was Pushkin 's season of the year . A long rectangular table overladen with all manner of Russian delicacies was in the middle of the vast baronial dining room underneath a glittering chandelier ,  |p112with  candles flickering under golden icons all along the wall . There were hundreds of them . One might have been in a cathedral . His boots sank deep into the thick red carpeting from Persia . Alexander Sergeievich heard a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin , " the huge male servant announced him in a mystic tone . A sudden hush fell over the noisy gathering . And he heard , " Alexander SergeievichPushkin ! " A female voice said , " Is it really Alexander Pooshkin ? " The Countess trotted toward him . " Monsieur Pushkin ! " the Countess gasped , " What a pleasant surprise ! " As if she had not sent her own carriage for him . She extended her hand to him . He took her slender bony fingers and kissed them . She led him to the table and sat him at the foot of it . The band began to play a mournful hymn . The air was alive with the smell of burning incense . The room was foggy with the smoke and smell of opium . The walls were ignited by the softly glowing candles under icons , burning blue and red and yellow . Alexander Sergeievich watched a big lumbering giant of a man enter the room and move toward the head of the table . As the man approached the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only then that he realized that most of those present were women , with a sprinkling here and there of eminent noblemen , a distinguished count , a baron , several ministers of state . Men close to the Emperor and their spouses . As the priest stood now at the head of the table there began a slow chant of mostly female voice . " Father Lev Gregorovich  --  " " Father Lev Gregorovich  --  " " May the Holy Virgin bless him . " " May the Holy Virgin bless him  --  " The figure standing at the head of the table was a hulking monster of a man , who lumbered like a bear with a head like a lion . His eyes were fierce black pools of moonlit midnight . His head was framed by a blonde and ragged beard and a head of bushy hair that seemed not to have made acquaintance with a comb in months . He was bulky and appeared to be as wide as he was tall , all six to seven feet of him . In his bright red tunic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unmade bed that had been slept in for many months without a single change of bed clothes . Glaring down the table at Alexander Sergeievich , Lev Gregorovich 's eyes were hypnotic , like lanterns gleaming forth from two black coals . Alexander felt himself about to rise as the eyes of Father Photius were demanding , but he held on to his seat with both hands , even as he felt a fine perspiration breaking out upon his brow . He grabbed the arms of his chair till his fingers ached . The mystical chantingcontinued . Finally the hoary archimandrite held out his hands for the chanting to cease and for the faithful to be seated.  |p113Now  Lev Gregorovich Photius sat there eating and drinking with a leg of lamb in one hand , a glass of wine in the other . He wiped his greasy mouth with the back of his hands and wiped his hands on his crimson tunic . And every time he belched or broke wind , the faithful said , " God Bless you ! " Lev Gregorovich bit savagely into a leg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , who took a bite and passed it on . He kept reaching for legs of lamb , taking bites like a ravenous bear and passing them along . Now the stench of this holy man mixing with the smell of incense and opium reached Pushkin down at the other end of the table , and the whole impact was overwhelming . Eating , drinking , belching , breaking wind  --  " God Bless you ! " Eating , drinking , belching , breaking wind  --  " The Holy Virgin Bless Your Holiness ! " Alexander Sergeievich felt an awful nausea building up inside of him , his stomach in an uproar now . A slow mournful chant began again gaining tempo as the men and women rose and moved rhythmically toward the holy hulk and kissed his hand and kissed him on his mouth . He was standing now and so drunk he could hardly keep his feet . And Pushkin thought , these were some of the favorites at His Majesty 's Court . Consultants to the Emperor of all the Russias ! Father Photius looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared . " What 's the matter with our famous poet ? Does he deem himself above the grace of God ? " He stumbled down the length of the table to Alexander Sergeievich and reached down with his hairy , ham-like hands and picked him up as if he were a baby , held him close and kissed him fully on the mouth , thrusting with his big fat tongue , as Alexander Sergeievich tried vainly to extricate himself . This holy hulk exuded an odor from his body that was overwhelming , like an over-used overflowing water closet in continual disrepair . His hot breath a cesspool of assorted stenches . His breath reminded Alexander Sergeievich of the smell of dead rats in the springtime who had starved or frozen to death during winter inside the walls of the ancient Pushkin house on German Street in Moscow , and of rotting food and age-old semen . His body was enveloped with the stench of death and decadence . Father Photius roared with laughter as Alexander Sergeievich kicked and pummeled , until Pushkin kicked him in the crotch . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a naughty child . " And threw AlexanderSergeievich back into the chair . " The Holy Virgin even loves Her infidels . " Father Photius went back to the head of the table . The music had reached a frenzied tempo now . He raised both hairy hands again . " Purify yourselves before the Holy Virgin . I am Her representative here on this sinful earth ! I am man and woman , boy and girl and even little infants ! " The men and women began to disrobe as did Father Lev Gregorovich . " I am the devil and the saint ! I am the holy contradiction ! No one reaches the Blessed Lady except through me ! " His eyes were black coals ablaze.  |p114They  were fully naked now and dancing around as if they were possessed by demons . " Come to me and be blessed ! I have slept with the Virgin many nights ! " he shouted . " Come to me and I will bless you ! " Father Photius was naked now and as hairy as a blonde baboon . They gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , man or woman , it did not seem to matter to the holy man . They danced till they were exhausted and fell onto the carpet where they lay amongst one another , and wriggled like a mass of snakes . Alexander Sergeievich thought he must be asleep and had stumbled upon a nightmare , as he sat there with the smell of the holy monster all over him . In his nostrils , in his eyes , he could taste the terrible stench of garbage in his mouth and throat . And he felt the nausea building up again , filling his shoulders his throat , his mouth , his nose , his face , his eyes , and he vomited and vomited till he thought his dear guts were erupting . He wiped himself with a silken napkin and the embroidered tablecloth , then struggled to his feet and went unnoticed from the palace . He awoke the following morning with Tatyana on his weary mind . With the evil smell of Father Photius still with him . He went into one of his habitual rages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ODE TO FREEDOM . He had worked on it ever since his Tsarskoye Selo days . He remembered his days with the muzhiks , potato picking in the fields at the time of autumnal equinox . He looked at his hands to see if the dirt was still beneath his fingernails . He could smell the salty perspiration . His limbs remembered the great exhaustion . I will sing of freedomAnd scourge the evil that sits on the throne .. . Shudder , pupils of blind fortune Tyrants of the world ; But lend an ear , ye fallen slaves , Gain courage and arise ! It was law , not nature , tyrants , Put the crown upon your heads . Perhaps Pushkin was so sick of Saint Petersburg , he wished to be banished from the scene , but nobody in their right mind wanted the salt mines of Siberia , or the bastille across the Neva River . It was not possible to get that disenchanted . Sometimes he would walk the floors of his two-room apartment all night long , the candles burning low . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction . Indeed , he acted as if he would challenge the Emperor Himself to a bloody duel , with the Heavenly Father as his divine second who would make all of the arrangements . His anger even frightened him . Deep inside of him he wished a confrontation with the one on High , His Most Imperial Majesty , the Emperor of all the Russias.  |p115How  else to explain his poem , even to himself , HURRAH ! HE 'S BACK IN RUSSIA AGAIN , in which our celebrated poet mocks the Emperor upon his triumphant returnfrom Paris and satirizes the speech the Emperor had made in Poland promisingliberty and justice to Poland and to Holy Russia ! While everybody still sang the Czar 's praises for his defeat of Napoleon  --  He was known throughout Europe as the Inspiration and Grand Architect of the Holy Alliance , Blessed Savior of the Civilized World  --  the incensed poet wrote of the child Jesus weeping bitterly for the nations of the earth . Marya tries to stop Jesus 's wailing by threatening him with a visit from the Czar . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples of Russia , What no one does not know ; I have ordered new uniforms From Prussia and from Austria . I am fat , well fed , in very good health .. . Then standing lovingly and majestically over the cradle of the peasant woman Marya 's baby , the Emperor promises that he will bestow upon his beloved Russia liberty , fraternity , equality and justice . Pushkin relished this taste of bitterness in his mouth , as he licked the tip of his quill and laughed angrily as he wrote : At these words the baby wriggles Vigorously in his cradle ; Can it be possible ? Should I believe it ? Could it perhaps be true ? His mother tells him , " Close your sweet eyes , little one . For our good CzarHas finished his fairy tale . " What decided things for the Czar was other than the mere motive of revenge . Alexander Sergeievich was the first " People 's Poet " that Russia had ever produced . And he wrote in Russian ! Not in French , as so many Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Students knew his poems by heart . Recited them with wild enthusiasm wherever they went . Workers who could read , read Pushkin . Czarist informers sent word to the Emperor of workers walking off the job after students read to them from Pushkin in Bukhara and Samarkand three thousand versts from Saint Petersburg , out there on the eastern desert amongst the brown Uzbeks . His poem , THE VILLAGE , was the ultimate . Like his ODE TO FREEDOM , it was a poem he started while at the Lycee in Tsarskoye Selo . He finished it in his crowded two-room flat in Saint Petersburg , which he shared with Nikita Koslov . It was passed around from hand to hand and mouth to mouth . A romanticizing of country life . He waxed nostalgic for his great-grandfather 's estate at Mikhailovskoye.  |p116I  love tins mcadowland with its fragrant haystacks And bushes enlaced by singing rivulets . Far off , two lakes spread out their blue expansesWhere the fisher 's sail blinks white from time to time .. . Suddenly , in that incommodious dimly-lighted two-room flat , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . He had seen them only once since he 'd left home for Tsarskoye Selo . During his third year at the Lycee they had come up for a visit at Christmas time . They had genuinely enjoyed each other for the first few days , imbued as they all were with the Christmas spirit  --  eating , drinking , dancing , laughing . But then the violent argument with his father over serfdom and the monarchy . Of course , even afterwards there were the letters from his father exhortinghim to patriotism and loyalty to His Imperial Majesty , reminding him alwaysthat , " You are an aristocrat ! Never forget it ! " No matter , they were his family ; so one day he took off by telega for his belovedMoscow . They were genuinely happy to see him . They put out the welcome mat , gave a party in his honor . The party was a huge success except that toward the end of it he got into an argument with one of his father 's ennobled friends . He spent three days in Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He realized that the less he saw of his mother and father , the better . As soon as he returned to Saint Petersburg , he went to work again on THE VILLAGE . Remembering the days of youthful yore spent in the little village in the Pskov Province . Running , romping with the muzhik children , playing , carefree . Mikhailovskoye ! The resurrected smell of pine sap and apple blossoms put a funny taste in his mouth , a crazy quiver in the pit of his stomach . And he wrote : Chains of hills and patchwork fields , A few flocks grazing at the sodden banks ; Farther off , smoking ovens and winged millet . It all breathes labor and felicity . As romantic as he was , his realism usually conquered his idealism and often got our poet into deep trouble . This wintry night he watched , dim-eyed and amazed , as if some unknown presence had come into his room and taken control of his poem , as his VILLAGE evolved itself into an attack against the boyar landlords and the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a poem he had begun working on when he loved his lusty revolutionary baroness . He thought of the potato pickers around Tsarskoye Selo , and somehow it brought back memories of the serf friend of his young days , Piotra Ivanovich , and his brother , who 'd lived near Grandma-ma Hannibal . He remembered Anton Ivanovich , the shepherd boy , and the mysteriously romantic steppe  --  Piotra Ivanovich 's dark-eyed sister , Natalya Ivanovna , impregnated by the gentleman of the manor house . He also remembered Grandma-ma Hannibal and the day he had found that the entire family of Piotra Ivanovich and Anton Ivanovich had been sold awayp117like drayhorses or any other beasts of burden . He remembered the terrible helpless expression on the face of the father , Ivan Ivanovich , the day he learned his Natalya would he taken to the manor house . He remembered , vividly , the potato pickers around Tsarskoye Selo . He fought against the softness in him that caused his eyes to begin to fill and the tears to spill upon his manuscript . And angrily he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The gaunt old serf struggles down the furrows Of some implacable master , And again and again remembering , anguishedly , happy faced , sorrow-eyed Natalya Ivanovna , he wrote : Not daring to dream anymore , or hope for them : His little girls growing upTo feed the lust of some vice-sodden old monster .. In Kharkov , more than a thousand versts away from Petersburg , ten men were arrested for subversive activities against the state . Pushkin 's poems were found on every one of them . Shopkeepers , hustlers , whores , working men , working women . Alexander Pushkin was their poet . Alexander Sergeievich himself was genuinely astonished at the impact the words of his brain had wrought on the Russian people . Sometimes it actually frightened him . Why could n't he just write and have others just enjoy his writing ? Common soldiers in the garrisons knew his works . This young upstart , this ingrate who would bite the hand that fed him , must be stifled , squashed like a Russian cockroach . The benevolent Czar felt especially offended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an education , giving him a second chance at the Lycee , giving him a position as Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . Siberia would cool the thankless African bastard off , or freeze him to his natural death . He sent for Count Miloradovich , the governor-general of Saint Petersburg . After a heated discussion with Czar Nicholas , the governor sent for Alexander Pushkin . While the Imperial storm was gathering like a whirlwind around Pushkin 's head , a member of the Secret Police approached Pushkin 's valet on the street near their apartment and offered him fifty rubles to steal all of the poet 's manuscripts and bring them to him for his scrutiny . He would be rendering a service to the Emperor , God and Motherland , in that order of importance . Nikita refused the bribes and threats and hurried to his master to alert him . Alexander Sergeievich hastily burned all of his revolutionary writings , some of which he had been working on since his days at the Lycee . And now he stood leaning on the mantlepiece with tears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to thinnest ashes in the fireplace . At twenty years ofp118age , he felt something deep deep inside of him dying at that dreadful moment . He thought , a flame had died within him that would never be rekindled . Count Miloradovich lay sprawled on his green divan in his drawing room attiredin a gold-embroidered Chinese dressing gown . He had sent for young Pushkin . He wanted the interview with this enfant terrible , this incorrigible sower-ofwild-oats , as he saw him , to be relaxed and informal . He was disposed this morning to be generous and paternal . He recalled the days of his youth when he had sown his own wild oats of revolutionary liberalism . Also , he disliked being rude with those on his own aristocratic level , men whom he had met at balls and parties and with whom he would be associated on a class and social basis . After all , they were both aristocrats . When Alexander Sergeievich was shown in by a manservant , he made an immediatepositive impression on the Count , who had expected a wild-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell you how flattered I am that a gentleman of your eminence and busy schedule would take the time out to grant such an unworthy one as me an interview , " Alexander Sergeievich said , as if he himself had requested an interview and had been granted one by the Count . " Your generosity , Sire , is incomparable . " Our poet continued as if he was rendering a poetic rhapsody . Count Miloradovich offered the young man some of his best cognac and a pipe to smoke and they drank to the Emperor 's health . Alexander Sergeievich was effusive . " Your reputation as a humanist , Sire , is legend . You 're one of the few men close to His Majesty who has never lost touch with the little people . Every singleone of us adore you . " The good-natured Count knew he was being intentionally and expertly flattered , but he liked the musical sound of it . He smiled expansively . " We 're all human beings , you know . Some more human than others , perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train of his thoughts . He was an elegant gentleman , handsome and stately , dark intelligent eyes . Perhaps , not unknowingly , Pushkin had touched a sensitive spot , a spot where the good-hearted nobleman lived . For the Count fancied himself a humanitarian of first magnitude . He was an avid reader of the French humanists . He believed in a benevolent monarchy . He believed in social tolerance , within reason , that is , to be sure , of course . Everything in moderation . After a few moments of chatting and laughing together like long lost comrades , suddenly Count Miloradovich turned to the question at hand . " I started to order your quarters searched for your inflammatory manuscripts , but we are the same , you and I , just different ages , different generations . We 're both of us aristocratsand that must mean something in Holy Russia , or what is the use of any-thing ? "  |p119Alexander  Sergeievich turned the comment over in his agile mind . Was the generous Count asking a question ? Rhetorical ? He answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The good-natured Count stared at the young poet who had the entire Russian nobility in an uproar , even those who did not read . He could not understand it . Where did the aristocratic youth of today pick up all that revolutionary liberal rubbish ? Though he knew that the Emperor was irritated by this Alexander SergeievichPushkin who was flooding Holy Russia with subversive unholy literature that many students knew by heart , he could not help feeling kindly disposed to this easy-going fellow . How could a good-natured , well-mannered chap like Alexander Pushkin actually be dangerous ? He said , " I decided instead of having your place searched , to ask you on your own honor to bring your papers in for my inspection . What do you say to that then ? " " It would be a waste of time , Your Excellency . I have already burned all of my manuscripts , but it 's all written here , " Pushkin replied , tapping the side of his forehead with his index finger . " And if Your Excellency wishes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything I have composed , excepting that which is already published . " " Fair enough , " the Count answered , and rang for his manservant to bring him pen and paper . The Count puffed on his long Oriental pipe , sending out aromas like the smell of burning apples , and smiled at the young vivacious poet with the generous lips and the dark blue animated eyes . " This is really chivalrous of you to go to all this trouble . " With Alexander Sergeievich 's photographic memory it was really no trouble at all . He sat down and for several hours wrote furiously all of the poems , all of the prose and essays , parts of manuscripts he had not completed , some he 'd never writtenbefore , as the Count looked on in pure amazement . Alexander Sergeievich forgot , conveniently , his most revolutionary material , but the Count did n't know the difference . When he stared at what Pushkin gave him , he knew he had much more before him than all the material the secret police had been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the poet , " You have behaved like a gentleman of your class , and we will forgive you the folly of your youth . We have all gone through these foolish stages . " Pushkin could not restrain a deep sigh . He thanked the Count , " Merci beaucoup ! " pecked him briefly on his graying whiskers , " Dosvidanya , " and took his leave without delay . It had been a pleasant interview to all concerned , but the good Count wondered about his next interview as he dressed in his formal uniform with sword swinging at his side and decorations on his breast , and rang for his man to have his horse harnessed for his ride to the Imperial Palace . He was going to meet the GodlikeEmperor of all the Russias , and was worried already about his promise of for/giveness to young Pushkin . He knew Alexander Romanov to be a moody and vindictiveman . Like Almighty God , the Emperor believed that vengeance belonged to him alone . Meanwhile , the word had gone around that the Czar would reprimand Pushkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the terrible bastille known as the Peter and Paul Fortress ? Was this the end of Alexander Pushkin 's brief career ? Old Karamzin , the Emperor 's own historiographer , donned his uniform and decorationsand went to the palace to plead the poet 's cause , as did Zukovsky and Vyazemsky , all of whom claimed the impertinent poet as their wayward protege who was the hope of Russian literature and would one day come into his own and renderservice to the Crown and become the great pride of the Motherland . Would His Majesty please have patience ? Pajaista ! It was a stage young people must go through , especially one of Pushkin 's artistry and temperament and genius . Now His Majesty listened agitatedly to Miloradovich , at one point rising from His Imperial seat and pacing back and forth before the flustered Count , who had given Pushkin assurances of Imperial clemency without consulting His Most ImperialMajesty . Everyone spoke on behalf of this irreverent Ivan Ivanovich . Even Herr Englehardt , the Lycee director , had come all the way from Tsarskoye Selo to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these impressive influential gentlemen see in this young African trouble-maker ? Then the moody Czar remembered General Insov , Inspector General of the Southern Colonies , who had sent him recent letters begging him to send some young officials to assist him . The Emperor said to Miloradovich , " I would love to send him to Siberia , as far away from here as possible . God knows he deserves it . But you have made him a promise , and I suppose I should support my Imperial officials . Though it displeases me that you would give him such assurances without my previous approval . See that it never happens again . " The Count wiped the perspiration from his forehead . " Never again , Your Majesty . You can rest assured . " The Emperor sighed . " Let us send him south to Insov in Ekaterinoslay . Cool his African temperament . Travel broadens the perspective of young people . Perhapshe will appreciate more fully the responsibilities of Empire . " When Pushkin heard the news , he was overjoyed . As far as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of banishment , he had been liberated from the prison of decadent Saint Petersburg with its hypocritical society , its interminableorgiastic parties , its stupid chatter and idle gossip , its pretensions at intellectualismand liberalism . He was sick of it all and now he could do what he was born to do . He could write ! He could be true to his talent and his muse ! He sat now in a tavern with his friend , Ivan Pushchin , telling him of his futureplans away from sick Saint Petersburg . " I never felt I really belonged at these interminable balls and parties . " " But you do belong , Alexander Sergeievich . You are an aristocrat. "  | " You 're damn right , I am ! " Pushkin exploded . " My family 's ennoblement goes back centuries before the Romanovs came to power . One of my ancestors rode with Alexander Nevsky , not to mention that my great-grandfather was an Ethiopianprince ! Six Pushkins signed the charter declaring the elections of the Romanov to the Imperial throne . Two more affixed their marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would this ambivalence never cease ? His great pride in the nobilityof his ancestry , his contempt for the present crop of aristocrats ? Pushchin said , " Well , there you are  --  " " But I despise this current breed of ennobled gentlemen , a bunch of pompous illiterate asses ! " Alexander Sergeievich exclaimed , " I had already made up my mind to stay away from these parasites and their Imperial orgies . This move by AlexanderRomanov helps me to carry out my resolution . I shall pray to the Holy Virgin to give Her blessing to the Imperial bastard . " Ivan Pushchin looked around to see if anyone was listening . He wished his friend would lower his voice . Alexander Sergeievich stared at Pushchin now . He would miss his Lycee friend more than anybody or anything else in Saint Petersburg . He was relaxed with Pushchin now and drunk with wine and vodka and tremendous expectations . He effervesced . He felt unconquerable , invincible , excitedly creative . He related to Pushchin how he had outwitted Count Miloradovich . Pushchin was astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you had burned ? You deceived the kind-hearted Count ? " Pushkin stared at his friend , put a glass of vodka to his lips and took it away only after the glass had emptied . " Do I look like an idiot to you ? " He laughed harshly at his Lycee comrade . " But you were dishonest . You  --  Pushkin  --  of all people ! The Apostle of Truth ! Lying to the authorities ! " " Do n't get so excited , my beloved comrade . There are truths and there are truths . There are Imperial truths and there are gospel truths , and they are just about the same , mostly lies . But then there are the truths that liberate the people , which are different altogether . " His deep dark blue eyes leaped with animation . He had never put it together in his own mind before . He articulated it now for his own clarification as much as for his admiring comrade . His voice hardened . " I do not owe the Imperial Court the people 's truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exposure . " Ivan Pushchin stared at the heavily-mustached man seated in the booth across from them . He seemed too interested in their conversation . Ivan Pushchin shook his head in wonder at his great friend of Tsarskoye Selo days . It was a good thing Sasha Pushkin was going far far away from Saint Petersburg , away from the eyes and ears of the secret police . He was too impulsive and outspoken . Ivan Pushchin marveled at his comrade , who at twenty years of age was riding the wave of an unheard-of popularity as a Russian writer . " You are absolutely in/credible , " he told the flamboyant poet , " admired by serfs and working men alike , literate and illiterate . Those who can not read have your verses read to them . Can you imagine ? There are men among the Imperial elite who love you , and even among the Emperor 's own Horse Guards . " He paused to catch his breath . " But of course , my dearest comrade , you have powerful enemies at the Imperial Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass quickly . Not that they wanted to be rid of him , but they feared for him , for he seemed determined to dig his own grave before departing . He wrote like a demon anti-monarchist and anticlericepigrams and had them distributed gratis at the theatre under pseudonyms that fooled nobody as to the identity of the author . His style , the Russian idiom , the stark beauty of its simplicity , were Pushkin 's signature . His enemies circulated the rumor that he had been called to the Imperial Palaceand thrashed naked like a common serf and criminal . That he pleaded like a miserable mouse , without pride or dignity . That finally he had kissed His Imperial Majesty 's feet each in their turn . Crawled on all fours like a snake . When the rumors reached Alexander Sergeievich he was livid . Gentle manneredAnton Delvig , had been visiting him at the time at his apartment . He told Ivan Pushchin that Alexander Sergeievich literally foamed at the mouth in his helpless rage . It was that feeling of utter impotence that frustrated and outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Imperial Majesty Himself to a duel , which was like slapping God Almighty 's face . In Delvig 's presence he sat down and wrote the Emperor as obscene and insulting a letter as he could imagine . He was talked out of sending it to the palace by Delvig . Poor Delvig got on his knees and begged him . From thought of actual suicide , Alexander Sergeievich went around for days plotting in his anguished impotence the assassination of highly placed officials in the Czarist Court , even thought of taking Emperor Alexander 's life . He discussed his schemes with Pushchin . His Lycee comrade pleaded with him . " No , Alexander Sergeievich , no ! Put such ideas out of your mind , dear friend . " " Why not ? " Pushkin demanded , staring at his best comrade as if he had been betrayed . Everybody was against him . Nobody loved him , not even Ivan Pushchin . He stared at his comrade and felt his aloneness more than ever . Why did he feel the need for change so deeply while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pushchin told him , " Your schemes are scatter-brained and doomed to failure . It is your life that will be taken . Besides , what good would it do  --  to kill one tyrant just for another to take his place ? Your own words , do n't you remember ? And Russianeeds you . There 's no one to take your place . Give me your word , old friend , you will not attempt these foolish ventures . I beg of you . " Pushkin gave his word to Pushchin.  |p123Nevertheless  , Pushkin openly displayed at the theatre a placard with a picture of a man who had assassinated the King of France , upon which he had written inbold letters : LET THIS BE A WARNING TO ALL MONARCHS . Finally on May 6 , the Day of the Ascension , in 1820 , Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin took leave of Saint Petersburg.  |p126Technically  and officially , Alexander Sergeievich was not imperially exiled or banishedfrom His Majesty 's Capital . He was still a governmental employee at the same seven hundred rubles per annum ; his duties had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he might perform them in an environmentmore suitable to his temperament . The kindly Emperor at all times had Alexander Sergeievich 's interest at heart , first and foremost . So the saying went at the Imperial Court and throughout the capital city . All day long that first day out he traveled by clumsy awkward telega , seated behind the driver atop his luggage , a flat-topped , rectangular pasteboard trunk , and lying on a bed of vermined straw at night , his heart overflowing with the joy of leaving decadent Saint Petersburg . Nothing could dampen his spirit as he marveled at the vastness and the beauty of the Russian landscape . The endless blue translucent skies , the rage of changing colors of the mountain range , the savannah land , the wondrous Russian steppes . The vast expanse of time and space , of earth and land and sky . The smell of wood smoke in the early evenings , clean intoxicatingfragrances of wide and open spaces so different from the city stench . This was Holy Russia , vast , endless and eternal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muse will surely love me now ! In contradictionto his euphoria , the travel by bumpy telega was arduous and exhausting . The telega afforded no seats for passengers . The roads , interchangeably , were bumpy , rocky , flooding , muddy and or dusty , depending on the moody heavens . Always the roads were hazardous , abounding as they were with brigands and ruthless highwaymen . The food was horrible in the cockroach-ridden roadside inns and posting stations . Most of the time Alexander Sergeievich preferred going hungry to risking death by food poisoning . Practically starved , he ultimately took his supperp127one night in a dimly-lighted roadside inn with flying cockroaches leaping about the table . He was kept busy knocking them off his bread and out of his plate . They were fonder of the cabbage soup than he was . The fourth day out he came down with the bloody flux . What is happening to my joyous feelings ? Even before he had left Saint Petersburg , a storm kicked up over one of his lengthy poems , RUSLAN AND LUDMILA . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savored and enjoyed and laughed at and not to be taken seriously . In this poem , Alexander Sergeievich had tried his hand for the first time at the epic , or , more truthfully , the comic epic or the non-epic epic . It was a satire on Romanticismand specifically the ultra patriotic Russian epic that was the fashion of the times in Russian literature . It was a whimsical tale of ancient Kiev where the culturalhistory of Russia had its beginnings . It came naturally with Alexander Sergeievich , disdainful as he was of Imperial pomp and circumstance . Sometimes it was a naughty poem fraught with sexual undertones . The moment the comic epic was published , the public took sides violently , pro and con . Cries of " Atheism ! " " Sedition ! " Shouts of , " Patriotic genius ! " Sometimes he thought that surely the critics had read somebody else 's poetry and had mistaken it for his . As he had worked with RUSLAN AND LUDMILA , it had conjured up the memory of Piotra and Anton Ivanovich and the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shazitel and his bylina . He could hear the old man 's haunting song . The tears began to fill his eyes . His poem was probably the first of its genre in all of Holy Russia . It was a joke that Pushkin was sharing with his public , but almost no one appreciated it . Why did n't they have a good laugh and then leave it alone ? Where is the Russian sense of humor ? If the Russian psyche lacked a sense of humor , damn it , he would give it one . The pompous critic of Saint Petersburg 's Neva Observer decried the lack of taste of this talented poet who misused his talent in an open display of vulgarity , whereas , " the purpose of poetry is to magnify with praise the beautiful aspects of Russian life , extolling the heroic aspects of religion and virtue , for the glorification of His Majesty 's government and empire . In this pretense of an epic poem , socalledtalent is wasted on trivialities . Possibly we have misjudged and overrated this young upstart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't the Russian even laugh at himself ! From other quarters he was attacked for having one of his characters engage in such an ordinary pastime as sneezing . " Who needs it ? " the indignant journalist asserted . " What is so extraordinary about sneezing ? Leave such obscenity out of poetry ! "  |p128Where  did all the beauty go ? I grow older like the saints and monks of olden times . The critic of the magazine , Vestnik Europi , threw up his arms in disgust over a scene in RUSLAN AND LUDMILA . " Spare me such detailed descriptions and permit me to ask : Imagine a bewhiskered fellow dressed in a drab peasant greatcoat and bast sandals intruding into the club of Moscow nobility and shrieking at the top of his voice : Howdy , fellows ! ' Is it possible that they would look with admiration upon such a wag ? " Pushkin threw the journal from the telega , shouting , " Gavno ! ( Shit ! ) " Much of the literate public was not ready for the commonplace in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kings and queens and emperorsand empresses and others of the upper classes . On the other hand , critic Merimee praised Pushkin 's RUSLAN AND LUDMILA precisely on this point . " Enough has been written about kings and queens and emperors . Pushkin wants to give the commoner and the peasant his day in the literature , and hurray for him ! Bravo ! " To hell with all critics ! The journey to his banishment was endless . It seemed long and hard and everlasting . One of his friends and former mentors , Basil Zukovsky , recognized the poem as a highly successful burlesque of an epic poem Zukovsky himself had attempted . Upon the poem 's publication , he sent Pushkin an autographed picture of himself upon which he inscribed : " To the victorious pupil from the vanquished master on that most important day when he completed RUSLAN AND LUDMILA , Good Friday , March 26 , 1820 . " Pushkin pretended to himself that he did n't care a kopek what the journals said about him . Nevertheless , he was more than grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it seemed centuries of time to the harassed bedraggledpoet  --  he arrived at Ekaterinoslay . Ekaterinoslav was just about as far away , southwardly , from Saint Petersburg as the Emperor could send this literary pain-in-the-arse without shipping him out of the tremendous reaches of the Empire . Pushkin 's fortunes did not extend that far , nor did the Emperor 's benevolence . Ekaterinoslav was the rear end of the very last outpost of Russian civilization . It was a pretentious mudhole making a pitiful impersonation of a city . When Pushkin arrived he observed a single unpaved main street bordered by one-story wooden shacks . Bearded unbathed muzhiks , adorned in baggy trousers like outsizedbloomers and wearing balloon-like blouses , led their straggly goats and horses down the muddy street stepping gingerly over steaming piles of horse manure . Some muzhiks were not so careful or fastidious . On an arid day , peasant women gathered the dried up dung for use as fuel to keep their houses warm in winter . A two-story house , almost non-existent , was looked upon in awe as a thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was , of course , thep129Potemkin Palace , constructed by the famous foreign advisor to , and favorite male concubine of Great Catherine the Second . Actually , as any citizen of Ekaterinoslav would tell you proudly , it was a town brought into existence by the great Potemkin and named for his great Imperial and Majestic mistress . There was this cathedral constructed by him , the founding ceremoniesof which were attended by Great Catherine Herself , at which time Potemkinboasted that this " humble edifice will , in time , be larger and more bountifulthan the Vatican and Rome . " The citizenry awaited patiently the time Potemkin had predicted . They boasted that the day would come ! One quick look around this mud puddle of a city and Alexander Sergeievich imagined he finally understood the meaning of the word godforsaken , that is , if the Holy Virgin 's boy child ever knew Ekaterinoslav existed . He dutifully reported to General Insov , Inspector General of the Southern Colonies . The General was an elegant middle-aged man , vague and absent-minded looking . An oversized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black heavy hair sprinkled with gray . He wore a neatly trimmed mustache and a handsome vandyke beard . They took an immediate liking to each other . Pushkin 's lonely heart lay half awake , catnapping on his frayed lapel , and he was vulnerable , susceptible , ready to love anyone who offered warmth and love to him . General Insov was instantly attracted to this brash young man with a parental affection , a thing Pushkinhad always vainly ached for from his own father and mother . An inveterate bachelor , Insov looked upon Pushkin as the son he never had . General Insov was the father Pushkin always longed for . A sensitive and intelligent man . Insov , seeing that the poet was troubled in mind and not enjoying the best of health , gave him practically no work at all to do . He imagined the lad needed rest and relaxation and time to think things over and get together with himself . And there was nothing for Alexander Sergeievich to do in Ekaterinoslay . No theatre , no opera , no soirees , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawling with cockroaches , fleas and thirsty bedbugs . Each day as the sun went down , the sleepy-headed town pulled in its non-existent sidewalksand bedded down for the night along with the chickens and goats who walked the street like human beings . Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin was the greatest excitement to hit the town since it had been colonized and established several decades back . He strolled through the village with his heavy stick and high hat , tight trousers , frock coat , and everybody turned and stared at him like he was something escaped from the circus . Alexander Pushkin ! The infamous poet ! With the swarthy complexion and the African countenance . Was this the way people looked and walked and dressed in fabulous Saint Petersburg ? The thing that Alexander Sergeievich thought he would never miss was the false sophistication of the capital city , the eternal orgies , the corruption , the fraudulentvalues , the literary movements that were hardly literary ; the theatre where thep130upper classes went , not because they appreciated drama , or ballet , or opera , but to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coiffeur , to hear the latest gossip . He had thought he wanted a place like this in which he now found himself , far removed from so-called civilization . But the change had been too sudden and too drastic . Probably had it been more gradual , it might have been different for him . But after the frantic noisy pace of Saint Petersburg , the hushed pace of this frontier village became a deafening roar inside his head . In a couple of weeks he was bored into a nervous wreck . Each morning he went to the wide Dnieper River , recently unfrozen , and went naked for an icy swim . Some days he went boating , always alone . The peasants of the town made up stories about him . They said he wore voile trousers you could see through , prancing back and forth in His Excellency , the Inspector General 's drawing room . You could see everything there was to see ! The ladies were deliciously horrified . He was overnight a scandal . He began to long for city life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible vermin-infested shack to live in . He lived with rats and roaches who refused to share the rent . Completely demoralized , Alexander Sergeievich kept to himself . Tried desperately to escape into his poetry , create a world for himself to live in , but his muse forsook him . He sat for hours in a quiet maddening meditation . He thought about the tales his grandmother used to tell him about his great-grandfather . He conjuredup the dreams he 'd dreamed of the land called Africa . Sometimes he sang , sometimes he talked loudly to himself . When nothing at all worked to arouse his sleeping muse , he would sit half naked in a corner of his room and shoot grapeshot pellets at targets on the wall . Sometimes the pellets were of bread or wax . He was an expert marksman , could hit a rose dead center from forty feet away . His walls and ceilings were pock-marked from target practice . Sometimes he used real bullets and picked off rats as they came boldly from their lodging places . One day as he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conjure up his cantankerous muse , someone knocked upon his door . He went to the door and standing there before him were two young men from the nearby university , looking scared to death . One with large thick glasses perched on his long thin nose , precariously . " Well ? " Pushkin said , with obvious irritation . The bespectacled member of the delegation said nervously , " We have come to see Alexander Pushkin  --  " What did they think he was  --  something on display for their amusement , a circus performer , perhaps ? Alexander Sergeievich said , " Well , now that you have seen him , good-bye ! " He closed the door in their startled faces , and felt badly for his rudeness afterwards . After they left , he went for his daily swim in the icy thawing Dneiper . The next day he came down with fever . There was one doctor in the town and he wasp131more expert at trimming hair and bleeding cows and horses than he was with curinghuman beings . He was a barber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goats and horses were more important than people . Animals meant kopeks and rubles , a meager commodity in these parts . Two carriages came to town the next day . The occupants were obviously of the wealthy aristocracy , and they were very well appointed . It was the family of GeneralRaevsky , a legendary hero of the Napoleonic War . His son , Nicholai a member of the Hussar Horse Guards , had lived in Tsarskoye Selo , when Alexander Sergeievichwas at the Lycee . They had been good hell-raising comrades . The Raevskys had heard of the famous poet 's transfer to the South and had inquired of his whereabouts when they reached the city . They found him in his miserable lodgings delirious with fever . They searched the town over and dragged the aging veterinarian out of his bed at midnight in his nightgown and nightcap , grumbling to himself , but to the Raevskys it was , " Yes , Your Excellencies ... No trouble at all , your Magnificences . " To himself he mumbled as he stumbled into his clothes , the goddamn haughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old bewhiskered horse doctor with the thick eyeglasses went with them to this horrible rat-infested hovel where the crazy infamous poet was raving out of his head . Dutifully he examined him as the Raevskys stood around and anxiously urged him on . Conscientiously he did bleed the ragged-arse aristocrat with Spanish flies and leeches , as was the custom in those days . Custom was custom , but Alexander Sergeievich got no better . His delirium continued , worsened by the hour . Nicholai Raevsky went to see Inspector General Insov and asked permission to take the poet with them when he was able to be moved . They were on their way to the mineral health springs in the Caucasus Mountains . Insov saw no reason to refuse the request , and when his fever finally abated , they took Alexander Sergeievich along with them . The Raevskys traveled in the style they could afford in two well-appointed fur-lined barouches , one open and one closed ; the legendary father , General Raevsky , with nineteen-year-old Nicholai and two lovely daughters , fourteen and fifteen . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open carriage with Nicholai , the rest of them crowding in the other carriage with the father . But in the evening when the wind began to blow across the wide and open steppes , and the poet began to shiver as if he was having a convulsion , they packed him into the closed and ermine-lined barouche . All day long and through the night they moved across the broad grassy plains , with the tall stalks of barley and maize and flax dancing a wild mazurka as the soft winds blew their hot breaths on them , yellow , brown , green and gleaming in the sunlight , dark and eerie in the golden moonlight , the great wide legendary steppes , verst after endless verst of rippling grain undulating from the river all the way to the hills and back . But now , as day broke dripping blood , streaking across the east/ern skies , they were in among the foothills of the magnificent Caucasus which lorded over everything and everybody . Nothing could escape its awe-inspiring beauty and majesty . Further and further in among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never experienced before . He forgot about his illness . He had a feeling he was being drawn by a magnetic power from which he would never escape or ever want to escape . Off into the distance stood the highest mountain range in Europe . His excited mind began to write . Every round went higher and higher into the enveloping golden mist of the morning . You could wash your face in the wetness of it . Away off to the right lay a wide expanse of purplishplateau  --  the whole damned world is one bad poem , he thought to himself , but you can make it beautiful , even in its ugliness . These mountains possessed a beauty that was grandiose and everlasting . He could see the road like a skinny serpentinetrail outlined up against the bright and blazing beige of the mountain , a magnificent piece of natural sculpture . In his mind he wrote a poem to all this feral and spontaneous majesty . A few hours later he would be over there looking down at the place where they were at this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against his chest as if it would break out of its prison . Danger would always affect him like this . Danger was possessed of a terrible beauty . It fiercely fascinatedhim . And the danger was beginning . It was real . It was not a poem he had imagined . There were men and women who lived in caves among these ranges whom the Russians had not yet pacified . Wild men , yet uncivilized , who without warning , would come howling out of the hills and caves like savage Indians of the far far farthest West , armed with bows and arrows and machetes , to raid and kill and pillage , seize arms and ammunition and noblemen for ransom . The Raevsky entourage was escorted front and back by sixty mounted Cossacksarmed for action , dragging a huge cannon to the rear of them . The possibilities of an attack made Alexander Sergeievich 's imagination run amuck . He hoped secretly for the Circassians to attack the Raevsky party . He worshiped danger and excitement . The Circassians were reputed to be the most beautiful white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . There were other dangers too . The narrow roadway snaked along the mountainside between a great wall and a precipicewith no parapets or railguards at its edges . He felt that one false move by the horses and the carriages would plummet off into a great white void and drop foreveroff the side of the world . He would fly around the earth for an eternity . There was the deep and awesome feeling of infinity amongst these mighty ranges of the Caucasus . Alexander Sergeievich said to pretty Marya Raevsky , " In the distance there isMount Ararat where Noah and his ark were stranded thousands of years ago andthe world had its rebirth . And over there is where Zeus chained the great freedomlovingPrometheus . " Nicholai Raevsky 's young sister laughed with him , adoringly . They reached a point where Asia merged back into Europe , and Pushkinimagined the two continents engaged in mortal combat all amongst these moun/tains for world imperial supremacy , and neither of them victorious . The mountains gurgled gleefully with underground streams of boiling water . It was like champagnebubbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was an experience he would never forget . Especially would he remember the lovely fifteen-year-old Marya Raevsky . And being a romantic poet he naturally fell immediately in love with her . At least , that is what he told himself . And why not ? Marya reasoned . Were not poets supposed to fall in love with lovely young things like herself ? Darkly beautiful Marya with the sparkling eyes large and wide and filled up with the greatest expectations from this life , her own dear life . Mischievous Marya . Bubbling joyously over on the brimming brink of womanhood . Her breasts and body were not yet fully formed , but there was plenty of evidence that they were on their way . And they would be ample and womanly . The coaches made a turn around the mountains , and suddenly there was the open sea before them lapping its frothy salty tongue at the edge of Russia . Marya cried out in pure ecstasy at the beauty of it , and she called upon the driver to stop , and leaped gaily from the carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoes as she ran , uttering little whoops of joy . Alexander Sergeievich watched as she waded out into the water 's edge , her dress lifted almost above her knees ; he glimpsed a gleaming flash of ivory legs and calves , as the waves came in and kissed her tiny feet , and went out again and then came back for other kisses . Alexander Sergeievich was moved to poetic ecstasy . That night he conjured up the spectacle again , and he wrote : ... and I envied the lucky waves And longed like them To lap your feet with eager lips . Late one evening , as blackness hovered in the mountains like heavy funeral drapes , and as the Raevskys slept the sleep of death , drowsed by the sleepyheaded rarenessof the mountain air , Alexander Sergeievich left his sleeping bag and sneaked away into the hills with a burning torch to light his way . Afterwards , when he looked back at his escapade , he wondered if he had dreamed the whole thing . And if not , then surely he must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delirium . Sometimes dreams and so-called reality were all the same to him . Perhaps it was a crazy poem he 'd written . After several hours of fumbling around the rugged , ragged cliffs , slipping and sliding , almost falling off the side of the earth , he stumbled into a ravine and emerged into a Circassian camp . When he recapitulated the experience , dreamed or real , he **26;16712;TOOLONG men and women seated around an open fire . These men and women spoke in strange un-Russian tongues . He walked toward them , his face aglow , his arms outstretched as if he would embrace them all . " Tovarischi ! " he shouted to them , joyously . These wild folk chained our hero to a tree . They disrobed our enrapturedpoet and examined him from head to feet , his mouth , his tonsils and his teeth and tongue , his chest , his loins , his genitals . Alexander Sergeievich wondered why he was n't frightened . Why did he stand there grinning like a mindless idiot ?  |p134Morning  came rosy-pink and apple-cheeked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation with him . The beautiful , nearly-naked women came and stared and snickered at him in all his shameful nakedness , their breasts bare and gleamingly tanned by the very nearness of the sun . They wore nothing save a cloth no larger than a small fig leaf . It was like an infant 's breechcloth , and it never covered entirely the blonde silken curls of their innocent pubescence . They tried to talk with him and he answered them as best he could . The tall handsome men with eyes as blue as the Tauric sky above them came again and again and talked to him , and he knew somehowthey were asking questions of him . He should have feared for his life , but he was too excited to be frightened . " No ! No ! No ! " he shouted . " I am not a spy ! I come as a friend . I 'm ashamed of the way my people have treated you ! " Then he told them , desperately , " But they 're not my people anyway . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they marveled at his olive darkness . They tried to rub it off . One of the women rubbed him till his skin was raw . She could not keep her gentle hands away from his wooly head . She was flaxen-blonde and smiling with strong white teeth and wide , wild blue eyes that always seemed astonished . Her newly nubile breasts were golden-toned and pointed toward him in invitation . They fed him wild delicious grapes and goat meat , hand-fed him till he felt filled up to above his eyes . The hetman of the tribe came and examined Pushkin 's clothing time and again . Alexander Sergeievich finally imagined that the hetman was trying to evaluate his worth in terms of ransom . They bathed every morning in a warm waterfall that flowed upwards through the mountain , defying the laws of gravity . The girl whom he decided to call " Marya " could not keep her eyes or hands away from him . On the second morning she took him with her to the falls and they bathed together , took him back to camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they chained him so he could sit himself down on the sun-cooked earth . She came and squatted nearby as she filled the almost weightless air with questions . Despite the language difficulty between them , with muffled words and signs of hands and sighs and grunts , they somehow made communication . " You not Russian ? " His memory of the conversation was , at best vague . " Not exactly ... " Exactly ? " She was rocking back and forth . " I 'm a Russian with an African ancestor . Ancestor , " he repeated . Her breasts were golden-brown and burnished as if they had been polished . " What is African ? " Her lips were full , her teeth gleamingly white and even . Her thighs were smooth and satiny , and the fringes of the curly tufts of her pubescence shone like silken threads around the edges of her breechcloth . " My great-grandfather came from a land far away called Africa . The people in his land are black . "  | " Black ? " she questioned . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and eyes . You my friend ? " she asked him . " How you my friend ? Russians do not like Circassians . Circassians do not care for Russians . I love you but I can not like you . You too much Russian even though grandfather come from far off land called Africa . " He told her that he understood , and he spoke to her of revolution . " What is revolution ? " she asked . He answered , " Revolution means to change everything , overthrow the rulers , make all men and women free , Russians and Circassian . Make all men and women everywheresisters and brothers . " " I like revolution ! " she said excitedly , rocking back and forth , her gleaming thighs the color of the bright beige of the earth they sat on . The next morning , as the sun exploded , splashing its warmth and light all over the mountains , she came to him and kissed his body . And when they went to the falls for a warm bath , he took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held each other warmly and trembled in each other 's arms . When they returned to camp , she took him by the hand to the hetman and she spoke to him excitedly of love and change and revolution , and Alexander Sergeievich understood then that his Marya was the hetman'sdaughter . The hetman turned to him and took him in his muscled arms and embracedhim , almost crushing him in two . He kissed the astonished Pushkin animatedly . And the poet finally understood that he had either gotten married or was about to be . They did not chain him to the tree that day . He was free , in a manner of speaking . They celebrated with him his good fortune . They sang , they danced , they ate the sharp tangy meat of the mountain goat , drank the strongest whiskey he had ever swallowed . It set a fire in his throat and belly . Everybody hugged and kissed him . Everybody danced with him . Everybody marveled at the texture of his skin , pounded him on his back . Drinking , eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head . His neck , his face , his eyes , his ears were entirely sated . It was only then that he regretfully remembered his tried and trusted friends , the Raevskys . They would be looking all over the mountains for him . The hetman broke into his thoughts , pounding him on the back and embracing him again  --  he was sure he had a fractured backbone . It took him all day long that day to persuade the chief that he must leave them and Marya whom he truly loved . The hetman raged with anger , seized Pushkin by the neck and lifted him off the ground threatening to hack his head off with a mean machete . But Alexander Sergeievich pleaded and gestured and talked his way out of it . And that night a couple of men led him back to the Raevsky camp . The Raevskys found him the next morning asleep in his sleeping bag and darker than he 'd ever been . They ranted and raved at him . " Where in the devil have you been ? " young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alexander Sergeievich answered . " Captured by the Circassians ? " the general repeated skeptically . " Why you ? "  | " I could never find the answer to that one , " Alexander Sergeievich stated . " We had a slight language difficulty . They chained me to a tree , but last night I escaped and made my way back to camp . Several times I almost fell off the side of the mountain . " Marya gasped at the horror of the thought of Pushkin falling off a stupid mountain . Encouraged , he began to make fanciful stories about his capture and escape . The Raevskys were so taken in by his fancies they forgot their anger toward him . He came out of the escape a legendary hero . They continued on their journey through the mighty Caucasus . When they reached the mineral spa , they joined up with the older brother , Alexander Raevsky . He was handsome and demonic of nature , a self-styled philosopher , nihilistic in the extreme , with yellowish skin and eyes like a venomous snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , was under the heavy influence of Lord George Gordon Byron , a jaded poetic renegade from the British upper classes . Nothing at all was worth the effort . There was no cause worth fighting for . Alexander Raevsky imaginedhimself the Childe Harold of Imperial Russia . Sophistication was the ship . All else was the open sea . After his own jaded experiences in Saint Petersburg , Alexander Sergeievich was ready for Alexander Raevsky 's " analytical " mind and his studied cynicism . The two would sit for hours , Pushkin seemingly mesmerized and all ears as he listened to Alexander Raevsky analyze society into oblivion and worthlessness , including love , marriage , nobility , women , family , motherhood , morality , convention , evolution , revolution . Nothing from nothing left positively nothing . Civilization stank to Heavens , except that there was no such place as Heaven . And bravo ! as far as Alexander Sergeievich was concerned . And then came Pushkin 's introduction to the actual writings of Lord George Gordon Byron . The impressionable poet dove in head first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He digested everything . But Lord Byron and Alexander Raevsky were not the only things that held the poet 's raptured attention . He was aware of the two lovely Raevsky damsels , especiallyMarya of the raven hair and the gypsy eyes , the mischievous mouth and the darkly beautiful countenance and the tiny feet that the sea had kissed . They lived in tents situated beside the springs that were all over the place like wild mushrooms . Hot springs , warm springs , ice-cold springs . Good for every ailmentman and woman could get themselves afflicted with . Rheumatism , consumption , madness , flat feet , stomach trouble , bad breath , flux , dysentery , aneurysm , floating tumors , and so on . Pushkin spent most of his time in one or the other of the many springs . He took a new lease on his life . Leaving the springs they journeyed to Gurzuf where Alexander Sergeievich lived with the Raevsky family in a palatial mansion , a two-story villa overlooking the sea . He spent many hours in the Raevsky library with books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older sisters , Katerina , who was already there , helpedp137him to decipher much of Byron . They were all happy to have this famous poet in their midst and the feeling was certainly mutual . He had never known the warmth of family life , and he luxuriated in the midst of it . And fell in love with all the girls . Reading , discussing , eating all the luscious grapes in sight , wallowing in femininearomas and affections , the sounds and rustle of skirts and petticoats . It was a time in his young life he would always cherish and remember . He loved all of the sisters , but it was little Marya of the dark eyes and tiny feet and lapping sea waves who won his susceptible heart of hearts . In all her youthful wisdom and precocity , she found it difficult to take our poet seriously . She said of Alexander Sergeievich later : " As a poet , he felt obligated to fall in love with every pretty girl he met . But he was really in love with the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " During his stay in the Caucasus , he was also soaking up experiences for his poetic muse . He did very little actual writing . He was too busy drinking in everythingaround him  --  wine , books , women , mountains , wild grape orchards , shriekingmountain eagles in their great flights toward the heavens . And one day he would take his goose quilled pen in hand and resurrect it for posterity . Katerina spoke perfect Italian . Pushkin came to her one day and asked her to teach him . She was a tall slim majestic young woman , and she was self-assured , with light blue eyes and a sense of humor lurking in the corners of her skimpy mouth . " I 'd love to , Alexander Sergeievich , but you will not be here long enough . " He hung around her day and night , talking , reading , asking questions . He concentrated totally . Inside of three weeks he spoke the language fluently . He made jokes in Italian . She was awesomely amazed at the power of his concentration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Marya and ask her , " Did I dream that Circassian experience ? Did it really happen ? " One day she stared at him , as they stood together on a steep cliff overlooking the sea . They could hear the monotonous sound of the sea waves washing against the mountainside . " And do I sleep with you and share your dreams then ? How do I know where you were those days we lost you in the mountains . Maybe you were out of your mind . Perhaps you still are . " He could hear the shrill cry of the mountaineagle . Marya stared at him again and saw his dear face flushing with embarrassment . His darkening dark eyes were so dear to her . She turned and ran away from him . He watched her fading in the distance . He turned and stood there for a seeminglyendless moment staring far across the sea at the rugged cliffs across the great gorge . He knew his aloneness more sharply than ever now , dwarfed as he felt by the vastness of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He looked down into the deep and endless gorge and his head knew a sudden dizziness . All the world was a blinding beige . He backed away from the edge of the cliffp138and stared across the way again , and watched a tiny speck of a bird take to its wings . Absently he watched it as it soared higher and higher . He wondered at what he imagined to be its unutterable loneliness up there in an infinite sky . The bird turned in the sky-blue heavens and began to loom larger and larger as it winged its way toward his side of the gorge and sea . Pushkin stood there mesmerized , as the bird came closer and closer and grew even larger . He could hear the flapping of its great wings now . A quivering sensation moved swiftly across his back from shoulder to shoulder . He wanted to move out of the path of this giant mountain eagle 's flight , but he was transfixed by a tremendous fear and great amazement . The fear was momentary . The amazement lingered . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he himself stood . Perhaps he was the great one 's target . But the magnificent bird winged its way swiftly past him , leaving a gust of wind in his path that almost blew our poet out into the great beige gorge , and came to earth on a cliff close by . It turned its golden-brown head toward Alexander Sergeievich and fixed its beady eyes upon him . Alexander Sergeievich shivered . The great king of fowls stared at the little man disdainfully . They gave each other stare after stare . Then it turned and flew away again . Pushkin watched it enviously . If he could only fly like mountain eagles ! Alexander Sergeievich stood there for an eternity of time , it seemed , entranced by the flight of the regal bird soaring majestically through immeasurable space , and he thought about himself , tied down as it were , to time and space on this uncommodiousearth . He remembered Tsarskoye Selo and the potato pickers , muzhik serfs shackled forever , tied irretrievably to the soil and sweat and tears and dirt and unrewarding toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great bird swooping earthward one moment and soaring toward the heavens moments later , see them knee-deep in the potato furrows , driven like insensible beasts of burden . If they could only fly like this majestic bird . If Piotra Ivanovich , his childhood comrade , and his sister Natalya Ivanovna could fly . The tears began to fill his eyes at the beauty of so much plumaged elegance in full flight . But now things were coming to an end , his holiday was over , and the next morning he would have to set out along with Nicholai for Kishinev in Bessarabia where General Insov and the headquarters for a branch of the Southern Colonies had been transferred from Ekaterinoslay . The night before he was to go he opened up his heart to Marya . He loved her and her alone . He could not live without her , he fervently declared . A smile trembledon her ripening lips . She was genuinely moved by these professions of undyinglove , but she remembered he was Alexander Pushkin , the incorrigibly romantic poet . " You love all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She wished she could believe that he loved her and her alone . " No , Marya , you ! You ! Only you and always and forever you ! "  |p139She  laughed . " Why then were you cooing like a sickly dove last night beneath my sister 's window ? " " You had been acting so cool toward me , sweet lady . So in my crazy desperationI thought to make you jealous . Please tell me that I succeeded . " Her dark eyes , usually full of mischief , now overflowed with tears . She kissed him on the cheek . " Poor dear Alexander Sergeievich , " she said . " I do love you darling , Sasha , like I love my own brothers . Perhaps I love you even more deeply . I love you for yourself , I love you for the beauty of your soul and spirit , I love you , I love you , I love you for your poetry , for your revolutionary genius . There is no personon this earth whom I regard more deeply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for the other kind of love , there is another fate for me . " Fate ! Fate ! he thought . Fate ! Fate ! God-and-the-Emperor 's will . Damn fate ! Damn the Emperor ! There was simply nothing for it ! This time she kissed him warmly on his sensuous lips . And she turned and left him as she ran sobbing toward the mansion . Later , and far into the night , they sat alone underneath a tree and they talked seriously of love and change and revolution . They swore to one another that whateverhappened , whatever fate held in store for them , conjugal and otherwise , they would always use their minds , their skills and energies for change and revolution.  |p140From  Gurzuf it was back through a part of the Caucasus with Nicholai Raevsky , most of the time beneath the deep blue sky along the Tauric coast . There was the terrifying experience of crossing a deep and gaping gorge along a narrow shelf of earth with a five-thousand foot drop on each side and no parapets on either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle of ninety degrees holding onto their Tartar horses by the tail , a thing that brought them vast amusement only afterthe ordeal had ended . Way up in the Caucasus they visited the Saint George Monastery with its long steep steps reaching down to the sea . They stared in wonderat the legendary Temple of Diana as it lay in solitary ruins . They went to the fabled Fountain of Bakshisarai , a rusty leaky reminder of its prior days of splendor . They walked around the empty sunbaked palaces . Tall , vast , blindingly beige , deserted , awe-inspiring . They gazed in solemn reverence at the eerie monument of the mythical lovelorn Khan . Alexander Sergeievich had taken ill again but dragged himself along with Nicholai to see the great Khan 's harem and his cemetery . They wandered through hundreds of rooms in the palatial harem , vacant now , except for startled lizards who scampered underfoot . It was in September of 1820 when Pushkin arrived at Kishinev in Moldavia , a Bessarabian province . It was even closer to the border than Ekaterinoslay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tartar horse that it was an unlikely concoction , a dab of Greek , one part Rumanian , one part Jew and a large general dash of Tartar sauce thrown in for good measure . Greeks were streaming into the muddy down-at-the-heel Bessarabian metropolis in escape from Turkish persecution . Kishinev was larger than Ekaterinoslay . Added to the horses and goats impolitely using the narrow streets for an outhouse were the ungainly camels defecatingall over everything and grunting and belching and polluting the air with thep141sound and smell of camel farts . Most of the streets were so narrow , if you stood in the middle and yawned and stretched , you would touch the one-story building on both sides and more than likely break your knuckles . Homeless urchins sat in the streets picking lice off their scabby bodies . Alexander Sergeievich was kopekless most of the time . He was still on the government payroll to the miserable tune of seven hundred rubles per year , a pittancewhich he usually spent at the gambling tables before it arrived . Sometimes he felt the government , like the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father wrote him pious letters extolling His Majesty the Divine Emperor for his generosity and understanding , and telling Sasha how grateful he should be , wishing upon him the blessings of the Heavenly Father Up Above . " Ponder over your childish sinful ways and ask Almighty God His forgiveness as the Emperor himself has forgiven you . " But he never included a single copper kopek in the envelope . If only once he 'd said , " We love you . " But his father never did . With camels groaning , belching and breaking wind outside his window , along with the Emperor 's spies , Alexander Sergeievich drove himself into his work . Lettersfrom his father made him feel his aloneness more acutely than ever , brought him to the verge of tears . He told himself he must not go mad . He was totally submergedin a melancholy mood . No matter , he must not go mad . He looked around desperately for something to laugh about , to raise his sunken spirits . His mother never wrote to him . She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vainly to seduce his fickle muse . He moved frantically toward humor as a saving grace , an act of simple desperation , pure and unadulterated . He started a poem about the Annunciation and the Immaculate Conception , in which he depicted the Archangel , Gabriel , as God 's procurer sent by Him to earth to speak with Mary on behalf of the Almighty . It was an act of recklessness fraught with unimaginable danger . Now , when Gabriel comes down and sees how lovely Mary is , he conveniently forgets his Heavenly mission . After fighting off Satanwho has already seduced the Holy Virgin , he makes love to Mary , as does finally God Himself in the form of a dove . Thus the Blessed Virgin has carnal knowledge with all three of them , one after the other . And then she tells her husbandthe fanciful story about the Annunciation and the Immaculate Conception , which Joseph is gullible enough to believe . Thus Joseph becomes the most infamouscuckold the world has ever known . When he wrote the poem THE GABRILIAD , it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how it really happened . Alexander Sergeievich broke into a terrifying perspiration when he thought about the consequences should the poem fall into Imperial hands . Chills danced across his shoulders . He enjoyed the writing all the more , spiked as it was with danger for him . For to mock the Immaculate Conception , to poke fun at the Blessed Virgin was tantamount to advocating the overthrow of the Monarchy , like casting aspersions on the chastity of a member of the Imperial family.  |p142He  walked the floor and wrote his poem aloud , listened to its rhythm , changinga " the " or an " a " or an adjective or verb or noun when he heard the tempo violated . Clarity and rhythms were virtues to this poet , and he listened carefully to himself read aloud , his mind on sharp alert for fraud in any idiom or nuance . Our poet worshiped at the altar of Truth and Authenticity . He despised all that was fraudulent . In his poem , God appears to Mary in a dream . He is surrounded by His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Most beautiful of our dear earthly daughters , Of Israel the youthful hope and joy ! I summon thee , aflame with burning love , To share my glory . Harken to the call . Make ready for a fate not yet revealed , The bridegroom comes , draws near unto His slave . " As Mary 's dream fades , one of God 's couriers , Archangel Gabriel remains , tall and handsome . She wished indeed to love the king of heaven The words he spoke were pleasing to her ear , And filled her with humility and awe  --  But somehow Gabriel took her fancy more . Thus the slim figure of some adjutantFinds favor , maybe , with the general 's wife .. . Meanwhile up in Heaven , the Creator , frustrated , agitatedAnd loudly sang : Mary I love , I love , My immortality means nothing now . Where are my wings ? To Mary I will fly And on her beauteous breast I will repose ! He summoned his favorite Gabriel And explained to him his love in prose . Gabriel listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king  --  on earthly terms a pimp . But Satan gets there before the handsome angel , Gabriel . He appears first as a serpent and comes upon dear lonely Mary in her garden . Then before her eyes he transforms into a handsome young man . Prone at her feet , not uttering a word , Fixing on her his wondrous shining gaze , With eloquence he supplicates , entreats And with one hand he proffers her a flower , The other hand rumples her simple blousep143And hastily beneath her vestments steals And the light fingers playfully caressHer hidden charms ... The marvel of it all For Mary this is , oh , so subtly new . But Lo , her virgin cheeks light with a flush , A crimson that is not the blush of shame . A languid warmth and an impatient sobCause her young breasts to rise and fall  --  and rise . No words she speaks ; but she can stand no more ; Scarce breathing now , her languid eyes half-closed She bows her head toward the expectant Satan , Screams : " Ah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our hero , Gabriel , God 's pimp , walks in upon this ghastly Satanic seduction scene , drives Satan away in a hard fought battle , then turns to the innocent and violated virgin and kisses her hand , fondles her breasts . The innocent girl succumbs again and is made love to by the angel , Gabriel . What shall she do ? What of her jealous God ? Be troubled not , my beauteous maiden fair . O women , you know love 's ins and outs , You know full well the wiles that can deceive , That cover up a pleasant little lapseWith all the trappings of sweet innocence . The errant daughter from her mother learns The lesson of submissive modestyAnd on the first and all decisive nightShe feigns false fears and pains that do not pain ! And on the morrow feeling better slowly , Gets up , can hardly walk , is languid , pale . Elated the proud spouse , relieved her mother , And once more the old flame 's back again . Meanwhile , Gabriel flies back to God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for His Heavenly Majesty 's Visitation . God prepares Himself for the trip . Pushkin laughed aloud at the satire of his own creation . The poem took him out of himself , rescued him from his loneliness , the depths of his depression . He was right there in the garden when it happened . Of course he was ! Perhaps he was Gabriel , Satan , was the Almighty . Perhaps he was even Mary . In any event that 's how it was , undoubtedly . This was the way it had to have been ! He bit the nib of his goose quilled pen , got up and walked the floor . He sat , and , as he read aloud , he beat his pen to the rhythm of his poem , nodding his proud wooly head in cadenceto the beat . Sometimes he 'd cock his ears and think he heard African drums his grandfather had once listened to , and that the rhythm of his poetry was Afri/can-influenced . He liked the idea of African influence in his work . lle heard Africanviolins playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house thinking that the houseguest of their master , General lnsov , had lost track of his senses , laughing and talking to himself like a madman . It was a moment in the poet 's life when he overflowed with anger at the church and its hypocrisy , as he saw it , and its collusion with the monarchy in oppressingthe Russian people . The mass baptisms of the infants in the frozen Neva . The pious Metropolitan at Madame Marya 's Home for Wayward Girls . The sanctimoniousAbbe Igor . Father Lev Gregorovich Photius , the saintly monster . It angeredhim to no end that he was forced by Imperial decree , as a civil servant , to attendchurch every Sunday . Some Sundays he had been out all night and would come stumbling into church roaring drunk . He would be too drunk to keep up with the proper genuflection . Oftentimes he would be kneeling while the devout were standing and vice-versa . His carryings-on in church became a scandal . Sometimeshe would write a line so outlandish it would frighten him . He would change it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " To hell with it ! " and rewrite it even more outlandishly . It made him feel good to live at the edge of the steepest precipice . He remembered vividly the dangerous lonely freedom of the mountain eagle . And he wrote dangerously ! A sweet enchanting dove flies in her window Above her flips and flaps its wings and flutters And sings its little winsome birdlike songs Then suddenly between her legs flies in , Alights upon the rose and trembles there , Claws , turns around , and claws again , again , Works with its feet and with its little beak . Oh this is God ! Mary has understood That this dove is an Almighty guest ; Her knees drawn tight , the Hebrew maid cried out , Began to sigh , to tremble , and to plead . To weep , but no , triumphant is the dove , In love 's hot heat he quivers and he chirrups , Then falls into light sleep , by love undone , Resting an idle wing across the rose . The Blessed Virgin falls into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the occurrence . He 's flown away . All weary , Mary thinks : What furious pranks and happenings are these ! One , two and three  --  how eager they all seem . This has been quite a day , I must admit ! In one and the same day I fell preyto Satan and to Gabriel and to God.  |p145He  wrote an epilogue to THE GAHRII.IAD . His epilogues were usually eerie premonitions , as if he were forever looking over his slim shoulders at the future that would come behind him , creep upon him unheralded . In his epilogue he wrote , wonderingly , ironically : Days pass . Time , no doubt , unknown to me , Will whiten my hair with silvery powder . A sumptuous marriage at the alter rail Will unite me forever to some gentle girl . Oh sacred comforter , the ancient Joseph , Bending my knees , I pray to theeDefender , protector of cuckoldsI pray and I await thy blessing : Have mercy , grant me peace and tranquility , Have mercy , and grant me too  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife , Calm in my home and my neighbor 's affection . When Pushkin ran head-on into a problem with GABRILIAD , he fought it for a while , and if it did not submit , he turned to another poem inspired by his visit to the Fountain of Bakshisarai in the Caucasus . Failing there , he turned his capricious muse to another poem which would one day be famous , THE PRISONER OF THE CAUCASUS . The thing to do was to keep writing . Keep writing or go completely out of his mind . He drove himself like a master driving a recalcitrant serf . At night he went out on the town , although there was n't much of a town to go out on . He 'd been excited at first by the exotic nature of the city . Compared to Ekaterinoslavit was a vast improvement . But it was not Moscow or Saint Petersburg . It was another frontier mudhole , no matter that it was a larger more sophisticated mudhole than Ekaterinoslay . The people turned out in all manner of attire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Russia , begging was a recognized profession , even in Saint Petersburg . Deformed lepers littered the landscape in old Kishinev . There was a constant chatter of alien tongues . The air was permeated with the smell of animal dung and outhouses and smoke pouring into the streets from opium dens . The obese aristocracy sat in their large wooden houses , Buddhalike , and smoked their Oriental pipes and drank thick syrupy Turkish coffee and smacked their greasy lips on halvah and other sweets and fabulous confections . To this wild and crazy frontier town where anything and everything was proper dress , where people seemed to vie with one another to see who could wear the most outlandish combinations , Alexander Pushkin somehow managed to look eccentric in his velvet trousers and purple cape and scarlet fez . People came into town just to get a glimpse of the revolutionary poet from Saint Petersburg . It was not that Alexander Sergeievich worshiped at the fetish of sartorial eccentricity . Actually it was an improvisation to cover up his poverty . He couldn'tp146afford the price of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long Moldavian Cassock . Sometimes he would borrow a coat from a friend and hide the fact that it was too large for him by having one coattail pinned to his shoulder , the other dragging on the ground . Sometimes his spirits dragged the ground . One day he went to a ball in one of the great houses of Kishinev . In order to enter the palace , he had to step over and round a motley contingent of alms-beggarsand crippled lepers , one without legs up to his scabby knees . " Alms to the poor , Master . Alms to the poor , Your Highness ! The Heavenly Father will surely bless you . " It was like a chorus of a song in church these mendicants had rehearsed together . " Just a few kopeks , your Nobility . The Blessed Virgin will forgive you all your sins . " Pushkin looked down into the man 's lifeless eyes . Hope had died aborning in them . Alexander Sergeievich felt the sweat creep over his back and shoulders . There were children whose faces were severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the children 's faces if they forgot to wash them before retiring on their beds of filthy vermined straw . Back in Ekaterinoslav Pushkin himself would always remember to wash his face before retiring , no matter how inebriated he was , and to get the liquor from his breath . One night he had been awakened by an army of cockroaches on a hunger march across his face . This night he thought he might be ill . The beggar began to kiss the nakedness of his sandaled feet . He shook his foot from the cripple man 's slobbering lips and gave him his last kopeks and fled into the house . Alexander Sergeievich was dressed as an Arab in a long white flowing gown and multicolored turban . He made his way up long white marble steps into the hallway hung in heavy damask drapes . A manservant dressed in Turkish attire appearedfrom behind the drapes . Alexander Sergeievich gave the man his printed card . The tall manservant pulled the drapes aside and announced in fractured French : " ... the pleasure to present Monsieur Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the crowd as the noted notorious poet entered , thinking to himself , where in the devil did the Baron excrement come from ? It was not on his printed card . The orchestra had taken a brief intermission . All of his senses were assaulted by the thick and sickly aroma of incense and hashish and strong perfumes and body sweat . He breathed deeply and hoped fervently he would survive this night . He made straight for the table where his most recent love , Princess Pulcheria Varfolmei , was seated . He tried hard to make himself believe he was truly in love with this elegant woman , but he demanded of himself that he have some kind of relationship with a woman other than physical . At least they should get along with each other conversationally and intellectually . She spoke in a strange unRussian accent , which seemed a hazy combination of the twain of East and West in a vast head-on collision . She was a plump and lovely doll without a doll 's intelligence.  |p147Not  overly visible in the breasts , thin of mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stare at him in open-mouthed amazement . The Blessed Virgin knows he tried to get a conversation going , but all he got in return for one of his wittiest thrusts was , " I am laffing too bad , Monsieur Pooshkin ! It is too much fonny jokes you is telling me ! " The band of serfs began to play again . Alexander Sergeievich had plied himself with wine and vodka and slivovitz and was ready for some dancing . He loved to dance . Dancing was a poem to him , with cadences and rhythms and idioms and subtleties and nuances . " Monsieur Pooshkin , you ees zee goodest danzieur in ze world ! " The band was playing and Alexander Sergeievich and Princess Pulcheria were doing a frenzied mazurka . Heels were clicking . Hands were clapping . Dancers cleared the floor to watch them . A young Russian officer new to the nearby garrison ordered the band to cease playing the mazurka and to play instead a waltz . When the band complied , Alexander Sergeievich walked over to the band leader . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serf wiped the perspiration from his nervous forehead . " The captainordered a waltz , your Nobility . " " And I am requesting you to continue with the mazurka . " " To be sure , Your Excellency . " And the serf band began to play the mazurka again . When the mazurka was over , the young captain came over to Pushkin 's table . " I demand an apology from you , Monsieur . " " An apology for what ? " Alexander Sergeievich inquired . He thought to himself , the fact of his African descendancy had nothing to do with this present infringementupon his dignity . He was just being too damn sensitive . He had to be able to distinguish between mere coincidences and actually intended insults , deliberateaffronts to his sense of personal esteem . " You are an impertinent scamp ! Apologize at once , or you 'll have me to answer to , " the captain demanded . " It is you who are impertinent . As for apologizing , I am Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin , at your humble service . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face reddened , then lost color . Alexander Pushkin was a famed and feared duelist . But there was no way the young captain could save his officer 's face . When he went back to his table one of his comrades commented , " Save your face ! You 'd better concern yourself with saving your arse ! That scribbling African bastard is a cold-blooded killer ! " Alexander Sergeievich 's reputation was certainly deserved , though possibly not in such exaggerated terms . He was a deadly shot and preferred always to incapacitaterather than to kill . The idea was to render his adversary momentarily impotent . If the man stood still , he was absolutely safe , but if he moved , too bad ! Nevertheless , before the evening was over all the arrangements for the duel were made , the seconds selected . The duel was set for the following morning.  |p148Alexander  Sergeievich came to the duel grounds late , as usual . The young captain was pacing up and down a clearing on the edge of town surrounded by slim white ghost-like birch trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a heavy rain the night before . Jackdaws sat silently in the birches as witnesses to the strange occurrence . Alexander Sergeievich brought a bunch of cherries with him and started to eat them as the duel regulations were outlined to them . He continued to eat them even as the captain raised his shaky gun and fired . The captain missed . Pushkin did not blink an eye . He raised his own gun and fired , striking the captain 's cap in the centerof its visor . Then he continued to eat his cherries for a moment . After a while he asked , " Are you satisfied , my captain ? " The captain removed his cap and stared at the hole in its visor . He shuddered . Then he broke into a smile , threw down his cap and gun and ran toward Pushkin relieved and beaming . " You are truly a great man , Your Excellency ! " When he reached Alexander Sergeievich he made as if to hug and kiss him . Pushkin disdainfully pushed him away and turned to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last duel Alexander Sergeievich would fight in Kishinev , not to mention those that were narrowly averted . His boredom drove him into one dueling incident after the other . The word went around that he would challenge you at the drop of a hat or blink of an eyelash , or if you belched and did not beg his pardon . These rumors were a clear case of exaggeration . But in any event , it was certainly true that you impinged on his dignity at your own dire peril . Insov was kept busier averting Pushkin 's duels than he was taking care of colonialbusiness for the Imperial government . Sometimes , as a last resort , he would lock his impulsive protege in his room and take his clothes and pistols from him . Alexander Sergeievich was playing cards in a famous gambling house one eveningwith Russian officers . He did not hold these Russian officers in very high esteem . They were quite different from the revolutionary ones who had been his friends in Petersburg and in the Emperor 's Hussar Guards . He described the Kishinevgroup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He longed for people like Nicholai Raevsky , Kaverin , Chaadaev , Pushchin and his other comrades . This night he was losing , as usual , and suspected the game was being manipulated . His eyes were smarting and tearing from the foggy haze of hashish and tobaccosmoke . His face burned with his anger and his nostrils dilated ; his lips quiveredas he continued to lose . His anger was aimed more at himself than at these self-important , supercilious officers : angry because he knew he should have been at home at work with his writing . This realization did not help abate his anger at himself or at the officers . At one point he got so angry with himself he swept all of the cards from the table onto the floor and called the lieutenant across from him a " miserable bastard and a swindler ! "  |p149The  bile-faced lieutenant rose from his chair . " Monsieur Pushkin , you are an infant who should not be out so late at night with real men . Your parents are delinquentin their duties to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milk still on your lips . " The other officers laughed derisively . Alexander Sergeievich stared at the dark-haired , blue-eyed officer with the thinly waxed mustache and calmly replied , " The milk you see , my darling boy , comes from the miserable udders of your whore of a syphilitic mother . " He got up , left the table and strode out of the door . The next morning at the dueling grounds there was a blinding snowstorm . Both of the duelists missed their shots at twenty paces , tried again and missed at fifteen and then ten , gave up and postponed it for another day . Insov got wind of it and put his naughty boy under house arrest until the heat subsided . Some days , bored and very close to madness , Pushkin would wander heath his high hat with his great stick with the iron crook to the outskirts of town to a villageinside the pale where the chosen were allowed to live a precarious existence . Kishinev , itself , was bad enough , but the ghetto went from bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unspeakable stench that assaulted the nostrils miles away . Inside the pale itself , there were wooden streets with wild weeds growingup between the planks overrun with piled-high heaps of months-old garbage . Cockroaches , rats and other vermin traveled along the streets like citizens . He heard the constant hum of greedy flies who were better fed than people . He saw the holy men , Rabbis , with their long black heavy coats and large fur hats in the midst of summer heat . They were bent over as they trotted along with a strange and off-beat rhythm , as if they came out of their mother 's wombs supplied with yokes upon their shoulders . Children adorned with thin and ancient faces , as if they knew another existence some place some time eons ago . Alexander Sergeievich saw faces without hope staring blankly at the world with the empty eyes of the livingdead . Professional beggars roamed the streets . Prostitutes of tender ages and opaque eyes and impenetrable faces with younger brothers as procurers . Life was real and the smell of death was omnipresent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd written , a dream he 'd dreamt . The pale was very very real even in its terrible nightmarish unreality . There were the filthy shops and even filthier merchants hawking their decaying wares . Men and women haggling with filthy merchants over meats completely covered by glutted flies that nobody bothered to disperse . The poet 's shoes could feel the slime beneath his feet . From the time he walked into the pale , even before , as he approached , his stomach was in a continuous uproar . Whenever he left the pale , he wondered if Russia were worth liberating , if the people were really worth redemption . He seriously wondered if Russia itself were not outside the pale of what men called humanity . Another day back in Kishinev proper , in a more romantic mood , he saw an elderly woman bent long before her bending time , with her head bundled up inp150rags , her ancient face a wrinkled mass and a yoke on her shoulders , making her way slowly up the dung-heaped streets of old Kishinev . He saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith and hope still burning in her tired eyes . Eyes that had seen so much misery and still had courage left to hope . There was a beauty only he could see . His poetic mind imagined a halo gathered softly around her saintly face . And he knew that this was the spirit of Russia . Full of love and hate and openness and prejudice and backwardness , with hearts as large and wide and vast as the Russian earth itself . Almost unknowingly he walked up to the woman and kissed her on her scruffy cheek . Instantly he felt warmly foolish . She smelled of age and toil and human sweat . The frightened old woman made the sign of the cross . " I did n't do nothing wrong , Your Excellency ! " This was Russia , he thought , not Alexander-the-Holy-One and his mincystepping , lisping , French-speaking sycophants back in Petersburg ; he did n't need their love , God 's one and only Apostle , Emperor Alexander , who , by imperial decree , set aside a day each year for holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and with impunity . He did n't write for them . This was the Russia that inspired his poetry . The old woman , the scabby pock-marked children . One day , as he wandered aimlessly inside the pale , he saw a tiny girl come up out of the ruins of a deserted hovel , with the most beautiful smile on her face , a small pinched face with the largest blackest eyes , shaped like almonds , dark and wide and mysterious as a moonless midnight out on the steppes . He had never seen such eyes as Nina 's . The cockroached pockmarks on her face did not , could not take away her beauty , which shone from inside outwardly . She was a miracle of beautitude . His eyes filled with angry tears , as he took her thin-shouldered , almost weightless body up in his arms , and he went from place to place in search of her parents . They were no where to be found . Alexander Sergeievich took her to a filthy restaurant and sat with her and watched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final day of famine . Children gathered around the table staring at Nina and the curious stranger , some with their hands stretched out suppliantly . He ordered food for all of them . He was kopekless when he left the pale . The poet went each week to visit with little Nina and brought her food and all manner of confections . One day he tried to take her out with him , but they turned him back at the point of entrance to the pale . Then one day he went to visit Nina and she had gone away to Heaven to lie down in green pastures . The kindly restauranteurshrugged at him in helplessness . Dueling situations dogged his footsteps . At a ball given by the Moldavian uppercrust , he was dancing with the wife of a Moldavian aristocrat . He had been standing alone and bored , sipping ices and watching the scene , when Madame Jablonskya whispered to him , " My-my , we are honored to have such a distinguishedperson in our midst . " The band had just ceased playing a mazurka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And why are n't we dancing tonight ? Are none of the ladies of Kishinev pretty enough or good enough dancers for the famous poet from Saint Petersburg ? " The band had begun to play again , a waltz this time . Couples had begun to dance . She looked into the poet 's face , and , behind her busy fan , her eyes said , " May I have this dance . " He said , " May I ? " and took her by the hand . He knew immediately he had made a grievous error . Madame Jablonskya was one of the few women Alexander Sergeievich had met whom he disliked instantly , wholeheartedly and instinctively . His entire being , all of his senses , reacted against this aggressive horse-faced woman of thirty-five or forty . A hank of blondish hair piled atop her head like a hive for busy bumblebees . Her overfed obesity and slovenness , her garishly purple gown , the front of which dipped almost to her navel , putting her flabby sagging breasts on obscene display . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repelled him . She danced with her horsy body heavily up against him . She suggested in a hoarse and meant-to-be-sensual whisper , " My boudoir at home is as roomy as this place and much more comfortable . And we could really do some fancy dancing there . " Pushkin was indignant . What made her think he was dying to be alone with her ? " Madame , bedroom intrigue does not interest me at the moment . Neither do whores operating under cover of matrimonial respectability . " Perspiration broke all over her face like adolescent pimples , and he could smell the lady 's anger . After regaining her composure , she said , " My , my ! We are an Africantiger when it comes to defenseless ladies . Too bad such ferocity does not carry over to the field of honor . Instead , we are content to nibble away on cherries . " Alexander Sergeievich retorted , " You can be thankful , Madame , that you are apparently a woman . " He turned and left her on the dance floor and strode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent member of the Moldavian SupremeCouncil , and demanded an apology . The prominent boyar sputtered angrily , then went over to his wife . When he returned to Pushkin , he demanded , " How can you ask me for an apology after insulting my wife ? " " Kindly do me a favor , Your Excellency , and keep your whorish wife in tow , " Alexander Sergeievich cooly replied . The two men had to be kept forcibly apart . A duel was averted only by Insov 's intervention . He placed the poet under house detention . One night Alexander Sergeievich sat fuming in his room in Papa Insov 's house wearing nothing but his underwear . The General had taken his clothes from him to keep him out of dueling mischief . Papa Insov came into the room and sat near the window . He stared out of the window at the growing darkness . He pulledp152on his graying Vandyke beard and turned to look at Alexander Sergeievich . He looked around the room , at the iron bed high up from the floor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowl and pitcher , the candlelightedlamp on the center table , the oaken desk , the chamber pot beneath the bed , a trunk over in a corner . There was a picture of His Majesty on the wall above the chest-of-drawers . On another wall there hung a copper-colored picture of the Blessed Virgin and her Child . Pushkin watched the old man as he thought to himself that his room was not exactly commodious , nor was it lavishly furnished , but compared to what his hovel had been in Ekaterinoslav , it was extravagant , palatial even . Papa Insov pulled on his ear where the hair gathered thickly in great tufts . He cleared his throat . " My dear boy , you just simply must stop this foolish dueling . " " Where are my clothes ? " Alexander Sergeievich demanded . " Son , " the older man said softly , " do n't you know you ca n't kill off the entire world all by yourself ? And besides , one of these times , someone will outshoot you . Somewhere in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might just be right here in Kishinev . " Alexander Sergeievich repeated , " Where is my clothing ? " " Dear boy , I spend more time keeping you out of trouble than I do taking care of His Majesty 's affairs . I love you like my own son , darling boy , but by the Holy Virgin , you can not carry all the troubles of the world on your shoulders . You 're much too young and your shoulders are not broad enough . " " What am I supposed to do when bastards go out of their way to insult me ? " " What can I do to make things easier for you ? " the General asked . " What is troubling you , darling boy ? " Alexander Sergeievich stared at the kindly old man who was like a father to him . " It does n't make me happy , Papa Insov , to sit here in my underwear . " The older man spoke quietly . " Why are you always getting into mischief ? Why do you carry this anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The question is  --  why does everybody go out of their way to insult me ? Is it because they consider me an African ? Well , I 'm proud of my African heritage , and if anybody does n't like it , they 'd better stay out of my way , because I 'll not stand for any excrement from anybody , not even from the Emperor ! " " My dear Alexander Sergeievich , " Papa Insov said , " as I have told you a hundred times , nobody holds your African blood against you . That is entirely a specter of your own imagination . " He wished he could believe this kindly Russian gentleman , his surrogate father . He wished he could believe the things that happened to him had nothing to do with his African birthright , that it was merely coincidental that he was forever running into insults , real or imagined . But how else could he explain it to himself ? Was he excessively sensitive and hot-tempered ? He knew people spoke ( even those who professed to love him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man walked over to him and put his arms around him , kissed him on his cheek . He felt a tear spill from Papa lnsov 's eyes . " Dearest of sons , pride of my tired old heart , believe me , the Russian people love you , even as I dearly love you . They have forgotten all about your African blood . It makes no difference to them . They love you because you 're beautiful . They love your genius . They love you becauseyour soul is beautiful , because you are divinely gifted , because you make every one of us proud to be a Russian . It is your special gift to Mother Russia and the people ! " Tears were spilling from Pushkin 's eyes now as he embraced the older man . " But I do n't want them to forget my African blood , Papa Insov , and it does make a difference . It makes all the difference in the world . Whatever I am today , whatever I have given the Russian people , I owe to Africa and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of his life , his love for Africa and his love for the country of his birth ? Was n't there enough love in his lonely heart for both of these great land masses and their people ? He sat down and did not realize when the old man left the room . He looked up when he heard him return with his clothing . He said quietly , " Thank you , Papa Insov . " He kissed the old man fully on his trembling lips , then dressed and went out on the town . Sometimes Alexander Sergeievich would wander out to Gypsy camps on the outskirts of the town . He had long talks with organ grinders with their monkeys , spoke rapturously with the beautiful dark and carefree-eyed , sun-tanned Gypsy girls who held his hand , read his palm and made his kopeks do disappearing acts . He longed for the freedom they seemed to take for granted . He felt a kinship with these almost-brown complexioned people reminding him of his African ancestry , and thought seriously of joining them and losing or finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citizens of all the earth . Once he followed a camp of Gypsies and wandered with them for a while all over Bessarabia . He tried to go to Rumania with them , but he was stopped at the border . When Prince Alexander Ypsilanti , following in his illustrious father 's footsteps , led an uprising against the Turks in Jassy , of the then Moldavia , Alexander Sergeievich got excited and applauded fervently the great Greek 's grand heroics . Ypsilanti called on all of his Moldavian Greeks to rally to his banner . Greeks seemed to stream from Kishinev like the Dneiper River in floodtide . Alexander Sergeievich wrote poetry applauding the Greeks , he leaped upon tables in public places and versified the glorious rightness of their cause . " Freedom ! Freedom ! Liberation ! " He added verses to his ODE TO FREEDOM . Called upon the Imperial Russian Government to give them its support with arms and troops . He called , of course , in vain . The Emperor had no intention at all of allowing his religious scruples to dictate his politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Orthodox Christians and the Turks were Mosleminfidels , His Imperial Majesty lived in terror of people who fought under such revolutionary slogans as " Liberty " and " Freedom ! " It just might become contagious . In this case , piety , orthodoxy , infidelity were total irrelevances . Alexander Sergeievich even disguised himself as a Greek and tried to join the war , but he was turned back at the border by Imperial informers who spied upon this poet every hour of the day . His letters , the few that he received , were always opened and censored before they ever reached him . At the end of every week informerswrote letters to Saint Petersburg informing on his activities . " Pushkin is doing very little writing as we can see and getting into very little seditious mischief . On the positive side , he spends most of his time in gambling dens and other such debauchery , fornicating with every woman who will raise her dress for him . And there seems to be very few that are not more than willing . It seems they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about the African penis . It is truly amazing how they go crazy over this so-called famous poet . Withouta doubt the women here are spoiling him . " Some days he would wander into the Oriental part of the Bessarabian metropolis . He loved to stroll amongst the canopied bazaars and haggle with the Eastern merchants , the swarthy yellow brown-black people with their high cheekbones and slanted eyes , Turks , Tartars , Russo-Persians , Uzbeks , short and stocky , tall , gangling , swaggering , dressed in high boots , great shaggy dark crescent-shaped mustaches , long robes sweeping the ground , tall fur hats , bright-colored caftans . Listen to the various and varied Eastern tongues . Reeking with smells and incense from the Orient . Men of Muhammad with skull caps and fezzes and swords and pistols dangling from their waists . Oftentimes he felt more at home with these darkly visagedpeople than he did with Russians of the purest blood . Men  --  Alexander Sergeievich thought , poetically , romantically  --  whose ancestorshad swept across the steppes and rain forests and mountain ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Genghis Khan and Tamerlaine . The soft-eyed , slant-eyed , soft-voiced women with the marketplace atop their tilted heads . He loved to watch them walk , like pretty poetry put in motion . He fell in love with dark-eyed , brown-faced Sofia Petrovna Belinskaya , but his tragic heart was suddenly discouraged by an angry giant Uzbek who chased him with a saber . Dear Sofia Petrovna had neglected to tell our lonely poet she was betrothedto Boris Drasnokov . He had asked her if she were married , and she had answered simply , " No , Your Highness . " It was n't long before Alexander Sergeievich became disillusioned with the revolutionaryGreeks . His heroic poetry was one thing but reality was a different matteraltogether . Very few Moldavian Greeks rallied to the noble cause of Ypsilanti . Furthermore , a schism flared up and deepened between the leadership , despite the exalting fervor of Alexander Pushkin 's poetry . Valdimiresco , who fought for a democratic government , as against Ypsilanti , who sought to replace Turkish autocracywith his own bourgeois regime.  |p155When  the news reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news filtered through about the atrocities on both sides , the Turks mutilating Greek men , especially their genitals , selling the women , putting the children on spits and roasting them and tying women up in sacks with hungry rats and venomousreptiles . Alexander Sergeievich threw up his hands in deep disgust . As for the noble Greeks , the news was that they had slit the throats of Turks , excepting those who were rich and would bring huge ransoms . The idealistic poet was thoroughly disillusioned and demoralized . He took it out on his poetry . And he wrote bitterly : Give no freedom to the flockThe miserable flockAre for slaughtering and shearing . Their heritage down through the years Is the club and yoke with a rattle . He was losing faith in revolution . In a letter to Prince Vyazemsky he wrote , more calmly : " The Greek issue may be compared to that of my African sisters and brothers in America . It is hoped that they both may be delivered from their condition of intolerable servitude . But they will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the nature of the way things are . And it was ever thus . " The Imperial informers were mistaken when they said that Pushkin was not writing . He wrote every day that he lived . He would always do more writing than was apparent to superficial acquaintances and informers , even those who each day sneaked up to his house and peeped into his windows . Through all his turmoil and confusion , he somehow finished GABRILIAD , THEPRISONER OF THE CAUCASUS and THE FOUNTAIN OF BAKSHISARAI . When THE PRISONERwas published , he received a miserable five hundred rubles , although it sold well all over Russia . He went immediately into a deep depression . He 'd read the work from start to finish , go over every stanza , every line , every word . He was his own harshest critic . He 'd agonize on every page . He 'd find fallacies and discrepancies he could never find before the work was put into print . Queasy stomach , diarrhea , crazy headaches , dizzy spells , abdominal spasms . The poet pretended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , especially the journalists . But he did care . He wanted people to enjoy the output of his heart and soul , to gain insight and perception from the products of his busy brain . He did not write just for himself alone . His writing was an act of love . He went through all this creative agony out of love for his readers , and he 'd settle for nothing short of true love in return . He did not care for unrequited love . He had finished GABRILIAD long before , but it had not been published . He had done it in his own handwriting and passed it on to others who had copied it and passed it on . He was the most widely read writer in all of Holy Russia , and undoubtedlyone of the poorest , financially . Newspapers and magazines happily pub/lished his wonderful verses but refused to hay him . Unheard of writers plagiarized him with impunity . He was dying in his poverty and his vaunted popularity . Embittered and disillusioned , he dove headlong into love affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes , there was Calypso , the exotic Greek ex-mistress of Lord Byron . Her mother was a fortune-teller , and they lived uproariously in poverty and squalor . Beautiful Calypso was very generous with the gifts of her magnificent body , but she also sold her love for the proper price , a fact Pushkin did not learn of till he came down with gonorrhea . He laughed it off . He told a friend , " It is nothing more than a snotty nose . " During his stay in Kishinev , the General gave him a holiday and he took a trip to Kamenka and fell among a terrible den of rabid revolutionaries.  |p157Kamenka  was in the Kievan Province at the edge of Moldavia , where he visited the Davydovs . They were a powerfully rich family . The matriarch of the household was General Raevsky 's mother . The Davydovs lived in a large rambling villa with a man-made grotto and seventy-five or eighty rooms . The family was enormous . Grandma Davydov was Matriarch Supreme , presiding regally and graciously over endless rounds of parties  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place . Houseguests came for weekend parties , took up light housekeeping and often stayed for months . Celebrated nobility and prestigious parasites , abundantliquor , exciting and excitable women , music by serf bands , plenty of dancing , flirting , fornicating , revolutionary rhetoric by the bushel . Alexander Sergeievich was in his natural element . There was Basil Davydov , twenty-eight , dark-haired , heavily mustached , slim , handsome , a revolutionary theoretician of first magnitude , influential member of a famous secret society known throughout the Empire as the Union of the South . He was anti-monarchist to the core . There was also his older brother , Alexander Davydov , forty-two , as obese as his brother Basil was slender . Feeding his fat good-natured face and developing a rotunda of a belly with excellent cuisine was his declared preoccupation . Upon his arrival that first afternoon Alexander Sergeievich met Grandma Davydov , a tall handsome white-haired queenly woman , who welcomed him with a kiss and turned him over to a manservant . " Show our celebrated genius , poet laureateof all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief nap . " She turned to Alexander Sergeievich , smiling mischievously . " Get a little rest , Your Excellency . There is a dinner party tonight at seven-thirty . We will be honored by your presence . We will be incensed if you do not attend . Leo Adronov will awaken you in plenty of time . Meanwhile , please dream pleasantly . "  |p158Alexander  Sergeievich took the old noblewoman 's hand and kissed it . " It is I who will be honored , your nobleness . " " Ah ! " the old woman said , her face wreathing smiles as she sat there , regally , in her elegant throne-like chair of teak wood heavily draped with scarlet silk . " You are indeed the grandson of Ibrahim Petrovich . That man truly had a way with the ladies . He was so handsome and gallant ! I remember him at Great Catherine 's court when I was a little girl . " He kissed her wrinkled hand again . " Merci beaucoup , Your Highness . " She waved good-bye to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor and up the marble winding stairway to his bedroom . When Pushkin came downstairs to the dinner party it was already in full swing . They were all dressed in the latest fashion as they elegantly lifted their slimneckedglasses of the most expensive champagne and toasted the coming and inevitablerevolution . They were the most fashionable revolutionaries Alexander Sergeievichhad ever seen . From their attire they were more French than Russian . The women were from another world , a place he 'd never been before , not even in his world of dreams . Beautiful , articulate , charming , and all of them de bonne famille . It was Fat Alexi Davydov who introduced Alexander Sergeievich to his wife , the Countess . " This is my beloved spouse , Countess Aglaya . " He told Alexander Sergeievich , proudly , " A delectible piece de resistence , compliments of the House of Davydov . " Then to her he said , " And this , my dear , is Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin , poet nonpareil in all the Russian Empire . " The lovely French-born Countess stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She disrobed him with her dark eyes , as her scarlet tongue passed over her avid sensual lips . He felt warm all over when she said , " Everyone knows Monsieur Pushkin . Certainly every Russian woman knows him in the deepestrecess of her heart . " She spoke directly to him now . " You have broken my poor susceptible heart so many times , Monsieur . You have moved me like no other . " Alexander Sergeievich was heatedly confused . " I 'm so very sorry , Countess . I never meant  --  " She licked her generous red lips again . " Do not apologize , Monsieur , for being the greatest poet in the world . I have read every line you have ever published . " Later that night he lay restless in the vast high-ceiling bedroom . After the stuffy little incommodious room to which he had become accustomed , he felt engulfedby so much spaciousness . It was not the extravagance of the room that caused Alexander Sergeievich to be restless . He was thinking of the way they had received him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petersburg ; Count Vasilla Rubinsky , conductor of the National Symphony of Moscow ; Mademoiselle Frieda Molotovna of the Moscow Theatre ; Madame Rubinskayap159prima donna coloratura of the Saint Petersburg Opera Company . It was a register of the beautiful and gifted . Singers , famous actors , actresses , dancers , painters , writers , politicians . The creme de la creme of Russian art and politics , all of whom conversed in French . He had not fully recognized till now the importance of his life 's work to the Russian people , especially to the kind of people gathered at the Davydovs . They respected him , his work , the delicate thing he had forged out of an alienated life . His work was important to their dreams of a Russian future , of change and revolution . That evening he had drunk deeply of the heady wine of adulation , and he hoped that the sweet taste in his mouth would not turn sour by the morning . He felt a chill move swiftly now across his slender shoulders , a warm chill of excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweet euphoria . His life 's work was a commitment to change in this Imperial Russia . When he returned to Kishinev , in the loneliest moments of his endless banishment he hoped he would remember this beautiful interval of self-realization . For the first time in his lonely life he felt he actually belonged . Here in this blessed place he no longer felt outside . He belonged  --  to them . They belonged  --  to him . He , AlexanderSergeievich Pushkin , the son of Sergei and Nadezda Pushkin , the grandson of Grandma-ma Hannibal , the great grandson of Ibrahim Petrovich Hannibal , descendantof the magnificent Carthaginian , was one of Russia 's most eloquent voices for change . He had the power to move people . To move people . To set them into motion . He felt a heaviness upon his shoulders , an awesome responsibility . He tossed and perspired most of the night . Near dawn he heard the crowing of an egotisticalcock and another answer from nearby as he drifted off to sleep and to dream of great Grandpa-pa Hannibal . Running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian feldjaggers in their red capes and their cossack caps . I can hear the galloping of their horses gainingon me steadily as I run swiftly into the face of the wind , over the endless midnight steppe . With the national border now in view . Now the sweet winds lift me from the earth , then they let me down again , up down , up down , I am almost bouncing along ; this time I stay up with the tender breezes , higher higher higher , I begin to soar above the dimly lighted cities , some of them are bright as daytime . Now I am soaring high above the wide sea waters , soaring , soaring , ever soaring . I have finally left Russia behind me . I feel gladsome , feel transported . I hear voices , " C'est L'Afrique ! Welcome to the land of your great-grandfather . " Like a large and graceful falcon I circle , then go in and come to earth . Seated in a vast high-ceilinged room , I have seen this room many times before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black prince . I have heard this voice before . This is the throne room . Thick and deep crimson carpeting . Brilliant chandeliers . The young boy is dressed regally in a princely garment , a long scarlet robe that sweeps the floor . " You are welcome , my great grandson . " " But how can I be your grandson , since I am obviously older than you ? "  |p160The  young prince smiles , and in a strange jamiliar voice he answers , " Think far far far back to a time long before your birth . " He pauses . His voice changes , sounds like an older man , his face changes , the prince grows taller into manhood . The same dark brooding face , the same penetrating eyes , almost black , same generous mouth . 1 recognizehim as the man whose picture hangs above my desk in Mikhailovskoye . " It 's very complicated , " the prince says , " But you 'll understand it better as time goes on . No matter , you are destined to do great things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your pen will help to liberate the masses . " I recognize him now . " Grandfather Hannibal ! " He smiles and moves toward me with arms extended . Just then there is a loud pounding on the door somewhere , upon all the doors throughout this earth , it seems , as a chill moves swiftly across my shoulders . And I hear , " Open up in the name of His Most Imperial Majesty ! " Alexander Sergeievich awoke , lathered in perspiration , an icy coldness in his mouth . His body shaking as if ague-afflicted . Why was he shaking ? The high-ceilingedroom confused him , as did the silken bedclothes and the sunken goose down mattress . Where was he ? Why did he feel threatened ? Then he remembered where he was , remembered he 'd been dreaming . A feeling of well-being moved through him as he remembered that he was in a place where he belonged . Belonged ! And was appreciated . The people here loved him . For himself . He was no longer the outsider . Alexander Davydov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they have separate bedrooms ? " Ivan Mikhailovich said one drunken evening . He was a Colonel in the Engineering Corps . " They have different uses for their bedrooms . He takes food to his room and eats all night . She takes men to hers and fornicates . " The revolutionary Colonel laughed hysterically at his own witticism and pounded Alexander Sergeievich on the back and shoved him with an elbow . No matter , Pushkin would not laugh . He walked away from Ivan Mikhailovich . One night the obese gourmet passed out on the ballroom floor . His manservant , Leo Adronov , came to his assistance as he stretched out on the gleaming parquetfloor , sublimely snoring . When Leo Adronov sought to pick the fat one up , Alexi awoke for a brief instant . " Take your black hands off me , you fornicating Africanbastard ! " It was true about our man , Leo . He was darker than Alexander Sergeievich , and his head was woolier . Pushkin learned much later that Leo was a product of the vast and holiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of the magnificent Uzbeks near to India and China . Partially a descendant of the golden hordes of Ghengis Khan . His father , a Russian colonizer for the glory of His Most Imperial Majesty , Paul The One , endowed his mother with the Christian spirit by raping her at the very tender age of twelve . But to give the devil his due , he saved her at an early age from the worship of pagan gods . But Leo Adronov was an ignorant ingrate . He hated the Russians with a cordial passion despite the factp161that his fortunate mother died at thirty-one from overwork in an extremely unctuousstate of Heavenly salvation . He did n't give a damn that the dear woman was Up There feasting on milk and honey instead of roasting in the fire and brimstone of Down There on the devil 's spit . So Leo dropped his Master as he lay and left him snoring . Alexander Sergeievichand Aglaya had watched the entire performance . The lovely Countess took the poet 's hand and led him over to the manservant who stood near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian sonofafornicating pig ! " Aglaya took the manservant 's hand and squeezed it warmly . " Set the table in the antechamber . " She took Alexander Sergeievich by the hand and they left the ballroom . She led him down a long corridor and up endlessly winding marble stairs till they reached the antechamber of her bedroom . A long oaken table alive with alcoholic spirits , apples , grapes and other fruits , graced the middle of the antechamber , and a bright chandelier lit up the room like the middle of the day . Aglaya led AlexanderSergeievich to the divan and the poet almost sank out of sight in the silky goose down sofa . He had a sudden desperate feeling like going down in deep water for the very last time . Aglaya literally fell upon him and smothered him with kisses and her liquored breath . " I love you , dear Pushkin ! I love you , you goddamn infamouspoet ! " " I love you too , " Alexander Sergeievich mumbled without zest or much conviction , as he tried to readjust himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of things . But if somebody " loved " him , who was he to reject any show of human affection ? It was at this very moment that two men came unannounced into the antechamber . The startled poet tried to spring from beneath the frantic woman . Aglaya was not bothered by the interruption . " Put it on the table toute de suite and get out of here ! " the lady shouted softly at them . Leo Adronov stared at his mistress with dark and sad contemptuous eyes . " Mail Oui , Madame . " The dark one and his comrade proceeded to put the delicacieson the table and replaced the melted candles in the chandeliers . They worked swiftly , efficiently and left , Leo muttering disdainfully . Alexander Sergeievich wondered if the contemptuous glance by Leo was meant for him or Leo 's mistress . Aglaya leaned away from Pushkin . " Let 's eat first . There 's no need to hurry . There 's plenty of time . Relax , my sweet . You 're overanxious . " Alexander Sergeievich stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with delicacies . Caucasian pheasant , chicken in the Kievan style , shaslyk , pickled cabbage , kvas and sturgeon and caviar , black and from the choicest sterlet . Wines of all denominations including his favorite plum wine , slivovitz . They ate and drank till she began to belch and husband . Neither was she skinny , but slim and very well constructed . It seemed the food stuck to her ribs inp162all the proper places . She stood up from the table and stared at him with those warm wide dark and slanted eyes of hers and belched again . " Shall we retire , my pet ? " she asked . " I 'm getting sleepy . " " Of course . " he replied . And they went into her bedroom , undressed and went to bed . But sleep was far distant from the Countess 's mind and sweet intentions . Aglaya was made for love . With bountiful breasts for one so slender . His hands explored them , even as she explored him with her full lips and very very busy tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm wide eyes dilated as he moved into her , and she pulled him even further into her with her long legs wrapped around him . " Make poetry with me , beautiful poet ! " she shouted in a desperate whisper to him . " Make poetry with me ! Love me ! Love me ! Love me ! Now ! Now ! " And he went even deeper into her as they made drunken love together , and they promptly fell asleep . Alexander Sergeievich awoke perhaps several hours later to the sound of strange inhuman noises coming from the antechamber . He jumped naked from the bed and stumbled around the room looking for his clothes as the terrible sounds continued . He fell over a chair and Aglaya sat suddenly up in bed . Her bare breasts and lovely shoulders gleamed sweetly in the darkness . " What do you think you 're doing ? " she demanded of him . Alexander Sergeievich pointed frantically toward the antechamber . " What 's that awful noise out there ? " It sounded to him like Kishinev camels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she answered indifferently . " It 's just Fat Alexi eating . " " Your husband ! And how in the hell am I going to get out of here ? " " The way you came in , silly . " She replied in an exasperated tone . " Through that door . Were you so drunk you do n't remember ? " She yawned and belched . " He wo n't even notice , mon cherie . By now he 's drunk from overeating . He 's probably passed out again . That 's him snoring . " Pushkin stared at her unbelievingly . He looked around the room . With the moonlight spilling into the room he could see the silken golden drapes that matched the moonlight on her breasts . His feet sank deep in the thick rich pile of golden carpeting . How could he go out of the bedroom of another man 's wife and face the husband , and he a guest in the husband 's house ? There were some boundarylines to hospitality . He was not in a dueling mood this drunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be over something slightly less ridiculous . He could n't kill a man about the man 's own wife . He stared at her again and pointed toward the antechamber . " This is no time for makingjokes ! " he said in a shouted whisper . Aglaya stared at him uncomprehendingly . Then there was a sudden noise in the next room , a clunk of a sound like the iron doors of a dungeon slamming shut . " What in the devil was that ? " our poet whispered seriously.  |p163She  leaped out of her canopied bed in her transparent chiffon nightgown with the moonlight glowing through the middle of her . He watched the outline of her fine limbs and the dark inverted pyramid of her blessed womanhood as she ran toward him , her youngish bosom bouncing . She looked sensuous and desirable and ten years younger than she really was . She held her busy body up against him , causing things to happen in the middle of him . Forgotten for the moment was his terrible predicament . " That was his face falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can go back to bed now . He 'll be that way for hours . " She reached down and put her hot hand on his hardness . But he backed away from her , shaking his head . " I have to get out of here . I would be no good at all for you , or me , with your husband in the next room . I am not that sophisticated . Or decadent . " He dressed hurriedly . Aglaya shrugged . " There will be other times , mon petit . " She threw a pink silken negligee around herself . " Yes , " Pushkin agreed distractedly . " Other times . " As she led him tiptoeing through the antechamber . And there was fat Alexi with his friendly face upon the table , snoring peacefully , not one care in all this awful world , food scattered everywhere , a giant rat oblivious to everything and everyone excepting the fine morsel of shaslyk he was nibbling near Alexi 's mouth . Alexi 's snoring did not disturb this greedy monster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own predicament , as his flesh crawled crazily across his back and shoulders and dizzily downward from the back of his neck to his spine . He stomped his foot and shouted , " Get ! " The big rat turned and stared brazenly with beady , defiant eyes at the unnerved poet . Alexander Sergeievich stomped again and shouted louder than before . The rat , meat still in mouth , scampered across Alexi 's face , leaped from the table and disappeared . Alexi stirred , looked around him drunkenly . By the time his eyes reached Aglaya she had hidden Pushkin behind her . Our poet felt ridiculously foolish hidingbehind a lady 's scented negligee . " What was that all about ? " Alexi mumbled . " Who made that noise ? " " It was nothing , my pet , " Aglaya replied sweetly . " You snored so loud you woke yourself up . Did you enjoy your supper , Precious ? " " Very very good , " Alexi mumbled . " But who is that crouching behind you ? Why does n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue was thick and heavy now . The words came forth with difficulty . Alexander Sergeievich stepped from behind Aglaya with enormous nervous dignity , his face flushing with an instant heat . " Pushkin ! You old Don Juan devil you ! Have you been sampling my wife 's delicacies ? " Aglaya said , " I asked him to come and help get you to your room . I knew you did n't want to be bothered with that African ! I mean , Leo . " Alexander Sergeievich said in a shaky voice , " But I am an African , Madame . "  |p164She  said , " You are the incomparable Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin , the greatest writer on this earth . " " Mail Oui , Madame . At your service . But all the same I am an African , a Russianof African descent . " He countered . They took Alexi , drunk and stumbling to the bedroom next door . And they undressed him , Alexi mumbling and laughing interchangeably . " You 're the best comrade a man could have . Imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me . You are a m-man of gr-great humility and I shall n-n-never forfor-forgetyour kindness . " They put fat Alexi to bed and left him . Back in front of her bedroom Aglaya leaned against him again and asked , " Wo n't you come back now to sleep with me ? You know Alexi is never going to wake up now . Maybe by tomorrow afternoon . " Pushkin looked down into the heat of her wide dark slanting eyes and felt her youngish body against him . But the desire for her had left him , had flown in the light of day that was breaking all around them . She wiggled her body against him . She said , " Pajalsta ! " He said , " Another time . " And kissed her briefly on the mouth and left.  |p165And  indeed there were other times . A passionate Aglaya made her love with the infamous poet Pushkin . On the balcony at midnight they would stand holding hands , enraptured , and watch the dimly-lighted boats pass along the river like fireflies in the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main ballroomand the sounds of drunken riotous revelry of the rabid revolutionaries . And watch the clouds sail softly by a full moon heading in opposite directions . Right there on the balcony they made love beneath the stars . " Make poetry with me , poet ! " she shouted softly . Downstairs , it was : " A bas le roil " ... " Down with serfdom ! " ... " Up the Russian Republic ! " One evening Aglaya came to Pushkin 's bedroom and spent the night with him . But his visit to Kamenka was not all fun and frolic , wine , feasting , adultery , rhetoric and making love . There were serious creative moments . The poet did some writing . He wrote a poem to his Aglaya . The loneliness in her dear dark eyes reached him , touched him . In a way , he really felt compassion for her . He , of all people , certainly knew the meaning of loneliness . The poetry and the loneliness in him made him know she was not a happy woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aglaya For their mustache and their braided coat , Some for money  --  that I comprehend : Some because they were FrenchAs was my innocent Aglaya ; Leo was no doubt impressive , Exotic in his terrible " savage " dignity . Daphnis sang like all the angels ;  |p166But  tell me , my Aglaya , What your husband got you for ? And it was actually in Kamenka and not in Kishinev that Pushkin finished and refined THE FOUNTAIN OF BAKSHISARAI , lying face down all night long in the billiardroom on a pool table , biting on the tip of his pen till his lips were blue with ink . He worked without stopping , missed breakfast , dinner , supper . Two days in absolute solitude . Leo brought him food , most of which he left uneaten . He had thought , at first , that the longer he wrote the more facile it would be for him . But he found out very early in the game of life and poetry that the direct opposite was true . The longer he wrote , the more mature he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded of himself . Alexander Sergeievich was his severest , most apprehensive critic . Deeply suspicious of his own facility and craftsmanship . If it went too easily , there was something seriously wrong , maybe even fraudulent . He wrote , rewrote and then rewrote again . The poet tore up many pages . Agonized over every single word , every comma , every colon . He polished it down until it glowed and burnished , sometimes bled from the abrasion , and its deepest truth could never be denied . He laughed , he cried , he shouted for joy at every triumph of the written word and suffered every tragic incident . And he had many conversations with Leo Andronov . It interested him that Leo Lvovich Andronov was not the obsequious servant-type so popular in the myths of Russian literature . On his part , Leo Lvovich Andronov took a liking to the famous poet . More than once they talked together in Alexander Sergeievich 's bedroom . " What do you think of our hosts ? " Alexander Sergeievich asked Leo one evening . Leo Lvovich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a servant in this place . " They sat across from one another in the brightly-lit , high-ceilinged fourposter bedroom . " Sorry , " Alexander apologized . " But what do you think of the Davydovs ? " " They are all right , but I 'm not depending on their revolution , " Leo replied . Alexander Sergeievich sought to change the subject . He had been so harassed by Imperial spies , he was even suspicious of Leo Lvovich . " You say you 're from Tashkent , " he said jestingly . " But how did you become so black ? Is the sun so hot out there then ? I think you have more African blood than I. " " Quite possible , " Leo answered indifferently . " In the old days many African caravans came through on their way to China and India . But I 'm not from Tashkent . I was born in Samarkand . " Leo Andronov was a handsome specimen . Large head with eyes deep dark brown , cheekbones high up near his slanting eyes . Uzbek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thick curly hair beginning far back onp167his high wide forehead . Notwithstanding his status as a servant , he was a man who took his dignity for granted . " They talk revolution , but they do n't talk it with me , Your Excellency ! " " I am not Your Excellency , " Alexander Sergeievich replied . " You and I are brothers . " " To be sure , Your Nobility , " Leo said with amused sarcasm . " But your revolutionarieshave no contact with the Russian masses . They are going to have a revolutionof the celebrities and elitists and nobility . " He laughed heartily at the querulouslook on Alexander Sergeievich 's face . Pushkin could not help laughing . Staring into his intelligent face , Pushkin figured Lvovich was a combination of African , Arab , Russian and Chinese . It was a magnificent combination . He 'd never seen a more universal face in all his life . " I talk with you , Alexander Sergeievich , because you 're different from them . Your work speaks to the common people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide his pride and his embarrassment . It was one thing to be appreciated by the revolutionary elite , but it was qualitatively different to see admiration in the eyes of someone like Leo Adronov . Leo was of the people to whom he actually wrote and hoped fervently to reach , even though he knew , realistically , that most of the Russian masses were hopelessly illiterate . He thrust out his hand to Adronov and embraced him by the shoulders . " Thank you so much , brother ! " He kissed Leo on both cheeks . He poured them both a pony of vodka and they toasted the downfall of the Emperor . " Death to slavery ! " Pushkin shouted . " Death to slavery everywhere ! In Russia and America ! " He leaped up into the middle of his bed and began to recitenew verses from his ODE TO FREEDOM . One evening Ivan Mikhailovich , the self-proclaimed dangerous revolutionary of His Majesty 's Enqineering Corps , came into Pushkin 's room to have a drink with the poet . When he discovered Pushkin fraternizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you socializing with this African serf ? It is n't dignified . A man like you , with your genius and prestige  --  " Alexander Sergeievich answered heatedly , " We 're both of African descent . He might be a long lost relative , for all I know . " Ivan Mikhailovich said , " But you 're not an African , Alexander Sergeievich . You 're more Russian than the rest of us put together . Your great-grandfather was an African . And this man is a servant , a person of no particular account . I mean  --  but you , you'rePushkin exploded . " Do n't you tell me who I am ! I 'm an African because I choose to identify with my great-grandfather , and I choose to be an African because it makes me feel more honorable . Anyone can be a Russian . I choose to identifywith that part of me that you choose to despise . If that upsets you , what kind of revolutionary are you ? " " But , Alexander Sergeievich , I did n't mean  --  I only meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Russian . " He turned to his Uzbek friend . " Please excuse our bad manners , Leo Lvovich . The Great White Russian is as boorishas the Russian bear . " " You misunderstand me , Alexander Sergeievich , " Ivan Mikhailovich replied anxiously . " I did n't mean  --  " " I know very well what you mean , " Pushkin countered disdainfully . " You advocatean exclusive revolution of the privileged nobility , or all the superior Great White Russians . Yet there 's more worth to my African brother here than all of you so-called revolutionaries put together . You 're as bad as the fornicating Greeks . You 'll never overthrow a goddamn thing ! " Yet in his heart and soul Alexander Sergeievichwanted fervently to believe in a Russian revolutionary movement , in his time . A movement that would include Russians , Tartars , Armenians , Cossacks , Jews , Uzbeks , Black , brown , white , yellow , every single being who labored under the yoke of His Majesty 's Imperialism . One day the legendary General Raevsky visited Kamenka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted , though Marya did not come with them . Notwithstanding , they were like family to him . Like the good old times that never really were . That weekend the Davydov 's establishment was a hotbed of subversion . They gathered under the pretext of celebrating Grandma Davydov 's birthday , but actually they had come to plan a secret conference of the UNION OF THE SOUTH with its counterpart of the NORTH to be held clandestinely in Moscow that next winter . Both Pushkin and General Raevsky were kept on the periphery of the secret society . Both suspected its existence , but were never brought into the fold . The group felt that the General was too elderly and too set in his attitudes to be of any use to the revolution . As for Alexander Sergeievich , it was his good friend Ivan Pushchin 's idea , along with others , to keep the poet out of actual membership in subversive societies . " Do n't involve Alexander Sergeievich , " Pushchin had argued with them vociferously , " in any of our revolutionary conspiracies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too valuable to our cause to risk his life in these adventures which may come to naught but the scaffold or Siberia . Pushkin is our only hope to awaken the sleeping masses . " This attitude toward him had become another source of agitation to our poet . He felt betrayed , rejected , and distrusted . Outside again . Here he was exiled because of his inflammatory writings , and at the same time not taken seriously by the very same men who professed to be inspired and inflamed by his revolutionary output . Here for once he 'd thought he was in a place where he was accepted , loved , even revered . To hell with them ! He did n't need them . He did n't need anything or anybody . He had his poetry , he told himself . That was where the real world was . One evening there was a gathering at the Davydov 's which General Raevsky and Pushkin attended . The whole meeting was manipulated to prove to the Generalthat no secret organization could possibly exist anywhere in Russia . At onep169point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Union , put it up to the General . " Let 's say for the sake of argument that there is such an organization , are you ready at this very moment to join ? " They were all gathered in the softly lighted private chapel of the Davydovs . " Of course , " the General answered unhesitatingly , enthusiastically , " I most certainly am ! " " In that case , shake my hand , " Yakushkin said , smiling and reaching his hand toward General Raevsky . When the General extended his hand , Yakushkin broke down into laughter . " You see , it 's all a joke . There 's no such organization . " At which point all the co-conspirators burst into laughter . Alexander Sergeievich leaped to his feet with tears spilling from his dark eyes . " Tovarischi , I have never been so unhappy in all my life . Here I was thinking at long last I would be a part of something truly wonderful , something really ennoblingand worth living for , even dying for , and it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , comrades , I have never been so disappointed in all my life . A revolution is nothing to joke about . It is the most beautiful thing that can happen to a people in a lifetime . It is like the most beautiful poem in all the world . " From conversation with the plotters Alexander Sergeievich came to understand that unlike what he had envisioned , his colleagues were not planning a people'srevolution . They planned an elitist military coup like the Spanish , Portuguese and the Neapolitan revolutions of the 1820 's . One evening late at night Pushkin wrote his EPISTLE TO BASIL DAVYDOV , in which he said his " revolutionary " comrades were filling : The cup of FreedomWith chilled , flat wine , And tossing it down their gulletsWith Toasts to Victory , Theirs and Hers ; But they are playing games in Naples And Freedom will not yet survive . One evening he was having drinks with Basil Davydov . Davydov was explainingpatiently to young Pushkin that the only way to overthrow the monarchy was through an elitist military coup d'etat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what 's happening in Naples with Carbonari . It 's naive to think of a revolutionof the peasants and the working people . They do n't have the necessary intelligence . Things would surely get out of hand . " " What 's happening in Naples ? " Alexander Sergeievich demanded . " Absolutely nothing . As naive as I may be , I know one thing to be as fundamental as the sunrise in the Caucasus . Freedom won by the military elitists will never filter down to the common people . " " Do n't get me wrong , Alexander Sergeievich . No revolution is being plotted , " Basil Davydov assured the poet , condescendingly.  |p170There  was always this lingering suspicion that , even with his avowed comrades , the African in him had something to do with this alienation he felt so deeply . That night after the fraudulent meeting , he could not inveigle sleep to come . Even though he did not believe in their coup d'etat , he resented deeply their rejectionof him . Yebat them ! he told himself , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of his remembered life , since infancy , he had known this agony of not belonging , of being not of this earth . From his vaingloriousmother , from his whining innocuous father . And now he found himself outsideagain , even among his friends and comrades . Outside of everything that mattered . He remembered the exquisite emotion he 'd known that first night , of belonging . A welcomed emotion that , heretofore , had been a stranger to him . He had found a home , at last ! They loved him , they accepted him , they loved him  --  loved him ! They revered him ! Euphoria ! He had opened up his lonely heart of hearts to them . He had gone around like a man intoxicated by the rarest wines . And now this . What the hell was wrong with him ? " Yebat them ! " he shouted softly in his desperate solitude . They were not authentic Russians anyway . Most of them had forgotten how to speak their native language . When he engaged them in conversation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He spoke in broad exaggerated folk idioms and accents . He was a lowly uncouth muzhik when he talked with them . And he made them feel uneasy . Even passionate Aglaya , who shared his bed that night , could not cure his restlessness . He realized now he 'd always sought in the arms of women assurance that he was likable , perhaps even lovable . But it had never been enough for him . He wanted to be loved for himself and not for his poetry or the popularity it had provided him . Sometimes he did n't know what he wanted . Did he really want his comrades to forget that the prideful blood of Africa flowed in his veins ? When sensuous sensitive Aglaya could not arouse this passionate poet as she lay naked up against his nervous body with her voluptuous limbs and her active hands , lustful lips , she held his manhood , soft , relaxed now , in her softer fingers . She asked him , " What 's wrong Sasha , Cherie ? Am I so unappealing then ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew the feeble gesture from the real thing . " Nothing 's wrong , Aglaya , my pet . I 'm just very very tired tonight . " " Tired of what , mon petit ? And have you grown tired of your Aglaya then ? " He kissed her questioning lips , now eager for his love and passion . Why not just lose himself in the willing arms of this lovely woman who reminded him so much of his Tatyana with her openness , her generosity , her earthiness , her candor , her hungry lips , her almost total lack of artifice ? In a world where everything was fraudulent , she was the refreshment that his soul needed , desperately . Tanya ! He could see her now . Crossing herself and genuflecting in the icon corner before going into bed with him , like saying " Grace " before the feast.  |p171Coming  out of his Tatyana daydream he was conscious of Aglaya sobbing quietly , and the wetness on his chest . " So that 's it , eh ? I 'm nothing to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to fornicate with . You believe everything they say about me . I 'm just an ordinary slattern to you then , to fornicate with and then forget . " She went on and on , sobbing and talking interchangeably . " I am not the kind of human being to share your heartache with , or intellect . I 'm just a stupid bitch in perpetual heat  --  " " Hush ! " he shouted softly to her . " Shut up your silly babbling , you sweet stupidsensitive wench ! " " Talk with me then , " she pleaded . " Do n't treat me like an outsider though I may truly be unworthy of your deepest thoughts . " She had said the magic word unknowingly . Outsider . In his home in Moscow he and Tatyana had always been outside . An outsider because he was too African ? " A throwback , " his mother said , " to his ' savage ' great-grandfather . " A pariah in his own home , and now , an outsider among his revolutionary comrades at Kamenka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , what is troubling you ? " He kept thinking of this peasant woman from the steppes of the River Don . Tanya of the flaxen tresses . Tatyana , the love poem of his agonizing adolescence ; haunter of his secret wicked dreams , his sweet and dreadful sensuality . Tanya , who had taught him giving , giving him the gift of love . " I thought I was among people with a noble purpose in their lives , a group of revolutionaries , " Pushkin answered . " And now I find it 's all a joke . But perhaps it is n't a joke then . Maybe they were lying to me , " he added hopefully . " They are very dangerous revolutionaries , " Aglaya told him . " All of them exceptingmy beloved Fat Alexi . " " Perhaps they do n't trust me then , " Alexander Sergeievich said morosely . " They trust you , " Aglaya assured him . " They trust you and they love you , even as I love you . They love you differently , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . You 're too valuable to their cause , mon cherie . " " They believe I am not trustworthy . " Even as he said it , he wanted this lost and lonely woman to tell him that it was n't true . He needed a faith to live for . Desperately he needed someone to have faith in him . " You are wrong again , mon petit , " Aglaya whispered . " You are trustworthy , sensitive , wise , perceptive , lovable  --  " She sang a love song in his happy ears even as she nibbled gently at them . She continued her little sing-song love song . " Wonderful , ingenious and ingenuous , desirable , excitable , African , dynamic . You are all these things and so much , much more , but you are also impetuous . And they would save you from your own impetuosity which is an essential part of your irresistible charm . And after all , you are the incomparable Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin . And they must protect you , because there is no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But how can I be one half of all these things , when I have just begun to do the work I have to do ? " " You are absolutely every single one of these things . And even much much more , and that is why I worship you , " Aglaya insisted . He did not know how to contend with a woman who talked as much as he , and was articulate . He said gruffly , " Shut up , you babbling wench . You talk too much . " And he took her into his arms again and felt her tears upon his neck and her heart thump up against his chest , and she took the growing hardness in her hand , and she guided it to the misty place where her love was more than ready for him . And loneliness became a fleeting stranger as they made desperate love together , as the moonlight spilled into the room luxuriantly.  |p173Back  in Kishinev was like coming from fairyland to a life of harsh reality . His spirits dragged as he rode in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy main street of the town , clogged now with a traffic of ragged muzhiks on foot , horses , goats and belching camels . Camels who seemed , Pushkin thought , to have been put together by a committee that could not come to any agreement as to how these ungainly animals should be constructed . The narrow streets , the smells , the sounds  --  he felt an overwhelming tedium even before he reached his living quarters with the kindly General Insov . That night he made entries in his diary . Where is Russia ? What is Russia ? What is a Russian ? Is it the carefree life of Kamenka by the moonlit waters ? Good food , drinking , adultery , lovemaking , the good life with reveling revolutionary rhetoricians ? Or is it the illiterate muzhik bent beneath the yoke , standing knee deep in the muck and mire of his poverty , living from hand to mouth and thanking the gracious God and Blessed Virgin for every breath he took , barely living , never traveling more than twenty versts from the place that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head down , docile under the pursuing lash , the gaunt old serf strugglingdown the furrows of some implacable master ? Not daring to dream anymore , or hope ? Is it the Cossack living out his life along the broad endless beautiful life-giving steppes along the River Don , the giant breadbasket of Imperial Russia , the blessed steppes , an infinity of brownish-yellow stalks of flax and grain dancing in autumnal breezes , the broadest plains in all this earth ? Is it ancient Kiev in the vast Ukraine ? Is it the wild ' unconquered Circassians of the Caucasus , with their indomitable spirit ? Is it the people of the Crimea ? Is it the sloe-eyed Tartars , Turks , Tadjiks , the Uzbeks of Tashkent , Bukhara and Samarkand on the far-off Eastern desert ? Is it the vast and frozen regions of Siberia ? Where is Imperial Russia ? Is it Moscow , beloved mother of all Russian cities ? Is it in Saint Petersburg ? In the Imperial Palace where Alexander thep174Great , Czar of all the Russias lives gluttonously in ostentatious splendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Neva ? Is it in God-forsaken Kishinev ? Wherever it was , Pushkin wanted to leave this frontier outhouse behind him for all times . That same night he wrote to his great influential friend , Prince Vyazemsky in Saint Petersburg . Autumn is coming to this mudhole of the Southern Colonies , and I am freezing to death in this Southern paradise . Tell ' Alexander the Great ' this ironic nomenclature for the Emperor ) I 'm a good boy now . I have mended my youthful ways . Tell him any damn thing . How can I rehabilitate myself in this uninspired , godforsaken village where everything and everybody activates against the artistic temperament ? Where ignoranceand illiteracy run amuck . There is no one to talk to excepting dear Papa Insov , and he keeps too busy with his Imperial Majesty 's business and keeping me out of mischief and under house detention . One finally runs out of breath chasing the few interestingand available women . One can not construct an entire life on fornication , as you call it . I prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic than you ennobled Russiansat the capital . Perhaps ' making love ' is more appropriate for me , since usually I must feel deeply for a woman with whom I make love . I am not a cold-blooded fornicator . I need the fraternal community of fellow artists , my friends and comrades of Saint Petersburg . I was born and brought up in a metropolitan city . Frontier life is not for me . If I do n't get out of this place , I shall go quietly out of my mind . No , not quietly , loudly , screaming ! If you are my friend , speak to the Great One on my behalf . Ask Zukovsky and Turgenev to put in a good word for me . I am desperate ! Of all the ailments that afflicted Pushkin in his exile , the most debilitating was his terrible sense of alienation . His aloneness was an all-consuming passion , his desperate need for love and comradeship and understanding was ever with him day and night . It was a time when he was constantly taking inventory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royal blood of Africa in his veins ? An African who was born in Russia ? What was he all about ? What was he worth to himself ? To his family ? To his friends who conspired behind his back to keep him out of a revolutionaryconspiracy ? Sometimes he felt like screaming : " What 's the fornicating use ! " What was his writing all about ? Was poetry its own justification ? At the Lycee when he was only fifteen he had written : " Imagination , only thy art my reward ! " But it had never been enough for him . Art for art 's own precious sake would never be enough for him . It was a time when he found himself deep deep down in the pit of his despondency . He had to know what he was worth , what his life meant . Doubts assailed him . He developed stomach cramps , dysentery . He tried to write himself out of it . In his loneliest of moments in his dim lit room he began to write THE SOWER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every right to write of himself , and proudly :  |p175A  lonely sower of liberty , I left my dwelling earlyBefore the rising of the stars , And with my clean unsullied hand , I scattered life-giving seedAmong the enslaved furrows . Was it utterly arrogant of him to make such claims about his writing ? He sometimes wondered . Yet he wrote with lofty self-esteem : I neither live nor write for praise , but fear To die unknown in fame and story . I 'd rather win a little placeFor my sad name , some share of glory , One note , one line of poetryThat , like a friend , shall speak of me . There were days when he dwelt in a roaring living silence , as if he walked on tiptoes through the lonely chambers of his heart . Deep deep in his dreary solitude , he wrote wistfully and confidently , and read loudly to himself : Perhaps my liens a stranger 's heart May move ; perhaps by luck of fate , At last dark let the will not swallow The stanzas I today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may some day Point to my portrait and declare : " He was a poet , a man of scope ! " A lover of the peaceful Muses , Receive my thanks and salutations  --  O dearest friend whose memory Will shrine my fugitive creation , Whose hand of grace may yet caress An old man 's bays with tenderness . The swift wheels of the capital city turned , albeit slowly , creakily . And it took many days and nights for word to reach him across the steppes more than a thousandversts away from his Saint Petersburg . The talk amongst the capital literati was : " Poor Pushkin ! Something must be done to salvage this enormous talent for the glory of the Motherland . " While the wheels turned squeakily in the capital city , autumn came early to Kishinev , putting frost around the windows , and snow began to fall and camels shivered pathetically so far from their desert homeland . Wolves howled throughout the night . Pushkin trembled in his misery and desolation.  |p176As  winter swiftly approached , word came across the great white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the despairing poet was being transferred to Odessa to work under the wise benevolence of one Count Vorontsov . Pushkin had already heard of the famous Anglophile by the name of Count M. S. Vorontsov , Governor General of Southern Russia in Odessa , not very many versts from Kishinev . The Count had been educated in London and spoke Russian with a British accent . His personal secretary and receptionist was British . He even had a British groom , lackey for his British horses . Vorontsov was a blond , handsome , thin-lipped , pinched nosed , clipped-voiced , through-the-teeth gentleman , who saw himself as Viceroy for His Imperial Majesty , looked down upon the natives of his provinces as his subjects . He had gathered around him a coterie of sycophants and expert arse-kissers , mostly British-born , toadying to his every whim . He set aside an hour each day to receive suppliants at court . He listened to them with a paternalisticsmile which thinly disguised his insufferable contempt . Albeit he was a consummate actor and an expert at dissembling . Odessa ! Alexander Sergeievich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two brief visits to this seacoast city . It was not Moscow or Saint Petersburg , and no closer to those fabulous places of his wasted youth . Actually , it was a few versts further south . But it was leaving Kishinev , and that was good enough for Pushkin , momentarily . Odessa was a fast growing city with a theatre and Italian opera and ballet ! And restaurants and interesting rhetoric and dialogue . It was almost like going home . His most serious regret was to leave " Papa Insov . " Somewhere deep inside of him there was this sleeping dread of what a new chief held in store for him . After Pushkin left Kishinev , Papa Insov went around shaking his head sadly and prophesying to all who would listen . " Oh why did he leave me ? He 'll see ! He will not get along with Vorontsov . And I loved him like a son . Loved him like my very own ! " As if Alexander Sergeievich himself had requested his transfer . It was a move by the Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stricter firmer supervision . In the summer , black dust covered everything in Odessa like desert sand . It drifted along the unpaved streets , crept up to the second floor of buildings , crunchilyfilled the mouths and blackened the teeth , clogged the nostrils , burned the eyes . Living in Odessa was like working a coal mine . Noblemen and ladies wore shawls and capes to protect their faces and themselves from the inevitable black dust . Alexander Sergeievich came this time in autumn as did the rains , when , instead of dust , everyone was ankle deep in mud . Carriages got stuck in the thick black quagmire . Crossing the street was a perilous venture . One might very well lose a boot or two . Pontoons were constructed for ladies in long evening dresses to step onto out of their expensive carriages . Odessa was a frontier town fast becoming a thriving metropolis . It was a commercialcenter where each day ships came in from far away bringing delicacies forp177the natives , who were more than ready for them . Alexander Sergeievich wrote into his diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses , perfumes , china , latest styles , opera , ballet , news from the outside world . Africa , China , Europe . War ? Famine ? Revolution ? What 's happening out there in that other world ? " Money changers by the hundreds converged upon Odessa , and fortunes were made almost overnight . A jubilant Pushkin happened joyously along with the happeningsthat were Odessa-by-the-sea . There was the theatre where troupes come in from all over the world . Lovely ladies sat in expensive gowns of the very latest styles just off the ships from Europe . Madame sat there in her box surrounded by young gallant admirers , while her rotund wealthy husband snored through most of the performance , his fat smiling face fixed in a smug complacency , while flirtations went apace and longlastingassignations were consummated . A rich man 's prestige was measured by the number of young stallions and gallantshis wife attracted . Cuckoldry was a way of life . Of course , each nobleman had a few mistresses in his repertoire . Each night Alexander Sergeievich went to the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly in his element . Then one night he met voluptuous Carolina at a reception given for a troupe of ballet performers . Carolina Sohansky was the elegant older sister of Evaline Hansky , who was to marry Honore de Balzac . Carolina was a slim majestic woman . Her overripened mouth seemed lecherous and greedy for life and love and kisses . And particularly for intrigue . Her wide blue eyes seemed always on the alert , expecting or suspecting something . All that , and she was an intellectual , which somehow bothered Pushkin . But why should it bother him , he wondered . Why should he feel threatened by a woman who questioned everything , the Emperor , God , art , literature and politics ? One night as they sat together in her luxuriant salon drinking expensive wine and drinking in each other , she asked , " Did you really mean everything you said in THE GABRILIAD ? " " I mean everything I ever write , especially at the time I write it . " He added , " Of course , one 's attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think there 'll ever be a revolution in Imperial Russia ? " she asked . " Ever is a very long time , " he answered cagily . " Do you believe that serfdom should be abolished all over Russia ? Do you think the serfs are ready for it ? " This was a question he would never evade . Not even before the Emperor or the King of Heaven . He answered quickly , " Every Russian infant is born ready to be free . Every person on this earth . " Carolina could hold her drinks with the stoutest drinking Hussar . As they got drunker that night , Alexander Sergeievich became more amorous , but the more intoxicatedshe became , the more she wanted to engage in intellectual conversation.  |p178She  wanted to discuss the vicissitudes of Russian serfdom , especially those of women serfs . " When I think of what a female serf has to look forward to , I awake in the middle of the night and cry , " she said . " The first time I read your poem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your poem truly broke my heart . " " Speaking of sleep , my pigeon , do n't you think it 's time for us to get some ? " Alexander Sergeievich stretched his arms and yawned loudly and suggestively . " And does my conversation bore you then ? " She said fretfully . " You never talk to me seriously . You treat me as if I 'm nothing but a common serf girl . " " What have we been doing ever since we arrived here , ever since I 've been calling on you ? Talk-talk-talk-talk ! " He stared at her suspiciously . " Do n't you believe in making love then ? " It was not that he needed to sleep with this voluptuous woman . He was not overcome with an uncontrollable passion for her . It was merely that he had grown weary with the drift of the conversation , felt strangely threatenedby Carolina Sohansky 's facile intellectualism . Carolina said , " Yes , but  --  " He did not need this woman this night . So why not just drop the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no palpitation of his heart . He felt no throbbing in the middle of him . He was not inflamed with desire . Yet he heard himself continue , " It 's been months , and we have not gone near your bedroom . " He looked around him drunkenly and began to put on his hareskin greatcoat . It was winter and he could hear the snowstorm howling outside like a pack of wild and hungry wolves . He hated the idea of going out in the cold dark night , when there was a warm bed here to sleep in and a very lusty sleeping partner . He was pretending and the drunken woman did not understand . She was six years older than our poet and he had no illusions regarding her chastity . No woman lived as lavishly in Imperial Russia as she did without being bought and paid for . " Where are you going , my pet ? " " Home , as if I had a modicum of intelligence , " he answered . " As I should have done long before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petit ? " She said coyly . " Since I do not believe in platonic or unrequited love , you will probably never see me in your home again . " " But , my pet , I do love you . Truly I adore you and no other . " " You have a peculiar way of demonstrating your affection . " He had his greatcoaton now and moved toward the door , determinedly . " But , please , do n't leave me now , you impetuous darling , " she pleaded . " You should see that sensual mouth of yours . You 're like a little boy pouting because he can not have his way . And you can always have your way with me , if you will only persevere . " He had his back to her now , moving toward the door as the swirling blizzard raged outside . He would have to walk all the way to his hotel . There would be nop179coaches on the street . He hated whatever it was that kept him from leaving . She was undressing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she commanded him , " and let us have one more drink before you go if you insist on leaving me in all my terrible frustration . " He turned toward her and there she stood before him in all her stark and gleaming nakedness . Her ample breasts were breathing at him , her long legs so slimly round , inviting and provocative . He wanted to leave , he wanted to stay . He hated her for causing him such indecisiveness . " Come , " she said , " my sweetheart . It is freezing cold outside and no coaches on the street this time of night . Come and keep your darling warm . " He stared at her with the heat in his eyes and anger almost blinding him . She 'd known all along he was pretending . She moved toward him with those long lovely naked legs of hers , seductively , smiling , like a regal lioness stalking , certain of her hapless prey . He stood there watching her coming to him , hating the helplessness in him , his utter vulnerability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from this voluptuous woman , even as he heard the howling blizzard outside blustering the shuttered windows . Now she was all amongst him , as she put her arms around his neck and pushed her slim thighs up against him . She felt him growing hard against the middle of her , and she knew she was in complete control . She seized his mouth with her rich licentious lips . She reached down and put her hot hand on his growinghardness . She smiled arrogantly and said , " Then it 's actually true what they say about you Africans . You do possess a handsome and prodigious penis . " Alexander Sergeievich smiled angrily back at Carolina . He took her arms down from around his neck methodically , and stepped back from her . " What a pity you will never know the actual truth from this very particular African . " He turned from her and went out into the howling snowstorm and sloshed his way through the drifting snowbanks all the way to his hotel . He swore off fornicatingthen and there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried to escape from her into his poetry , started a poem he called GYPSIES , but there she lay on every sheet of paper , every line , every word and comma , naked with her long legs and slim thighs up against him , her wide eyes blue and asking questions . He told himselfwithout conviction that she was just a poem he had concocted . He had conjuredup a nightmare . He had to know all there was to know about this lustful lusty intellectual . How could she afford such a luxurious salon , a palatial villa hanginglike a giant beehive on a cliff overlooking the Black Sea , where she entertained her young gallants ? Was she independently wealthy ? An heiress ? Like Svetlina of the Hussar Guards ? He had to know . But no one seemed to know anything about this woman.  |p180Then  one day there was a knock upon his door , and when he opened it , in walked Alexander Raevsky . The two men embraced and kissed and drank much vodka and sat and talked of old times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same tall rangy handsome cynic with the yellowish and arrogant eyes . Accordingto him , " Politics is the game of fools .... Serfs deserve their serfdom or they would not be serfs . They would have long since changed their situation ... . Women were not made to love , but to be made love to or at , whichever , but never to be taken seriously . " Finally , the question came inevitably around to Carolina Sohansky . And of course Carolina was the mistress of the infamous Count DeWitt , who was an acknowledgedmember of the Czarist Secret Police , the notorious Third Section of His Imperial Majesty 's personal Chancery . Pushkin 's heart and spirits sank lower than they already were . He felt his heartbeat quickening . " Are you quite sure ? " he asked . " Of course , my dear sweet innocent child , " Raevsky replied . " Everyone in Odessa knows of it excepting you . " " And Carolina then ? " " They work hand in hand , my poor baby . She invites all the radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens up those lovely legs of hers and then gets them to tell her all of their subversive ideas , after which they mysteriously disappear and end up in Siberia or some other place God never cast his eyes upon . " Pushkin rose from his chair and began to pace the floor . " God damn that Carolinawench ! How could I have been so stupid ? I 'm undone ! Alexander the Great will surely cook my Russian goose this time . " The nattily attired coxcomb said , sardonically , " What are you worried about , my dear innocent child ? Sasha Pavlovich Romanov knows all your poems and ideas by heart by now . He is the Emperor of all the Russias . Why do you suppose they wo n't let you back into Saint Petersburg ? Do you imagine it 's because he 's jealous of your reputation with the ladies at the Czarist court ? He 's already sampled every one of them . " " Of course , " Alexander Sergeievich responded , sighing with relief . " I have no secrets from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They sat and talked far into the night , Raevsky doing most of the talking , Pushkin the avid and attentive listener . Alexander Sergeievich still held a fascinationfor this self-centered genius of a cynical popinjay . Carolina 's role was very clear to him now . She was a sweet and lovely trap and a bait for lecherous revolutionarieslike himself . And though he agreed with Raevsky that she presented no danger to him , he never sought her company again . He fell out of love with Carolina and fell immediately in love with Madame Amelia Riznicha.  |p181Even  while he went about falling in love again , which was a pure and simple act of self-defense against his maddening loneliness , he drove himself into his work to protect himself from madness . The possibility of losing his mind was ever with him . He started working on GYPSIES again . He recalled his days in Kishinev when he sought out those liberated nomads on the edge of town . It had appeared to our romantic poet to be the sanest freest spot on this entire Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT I MAY NOT GO MAD ! He was sick to theheart of words like " civilization , " and " progress . " In this cold white Russian world , he longed for Africa . He worked in a quiet heat of creative ecstasy . He would not answer the door when visitors knocked . Not even to Alexander Raevsky , who would stand outside and bang on the door and shout his name . " Alexander Sergeievich ! It 's me , your comrade Raevsky ! I must speak with you on a matter of monumental importance ! " He did not need Raevsky 's nihilistic attitudes . He needed to believe in life . The so-called civilized nobility of Petersburg and Moscow was not life as it could be lived . He needed desperately to believe in GYPSIES . And he spent his restive sleepless nights writing about a man , Aleko , a jaded Russian cosmopolite who escaped from the maddening revelry of Saint Petersburg and had run away and joined a band of gypsies . Aleko falls in love with a young gypsy girl , Zemfira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gypsy band . Alexander Sergeievich thought a lot these days of writing in prose . He had taught himself to be conversant in English and Italian as well as French . He was reading Shakespeare and was deeply impressed , and he promised himself that he would one day write a Russian tragedy . Imperial Russia was a tragic land . In GYPSIES , he began to move toward these determinations . He still wrote in verse but this time interspersed his verse with dialogue . The gypsy girl , Zemfira , asks Aleko , the sophisticated Russian from the capital city : Tell me , my friend : do n't you regret All you left behind for good ? Aleko : What did I leave behind ? Zemfira : You knowYour country 's people , city life . Aleko : I have no regrets . Could you but know , Could you but feel how city life Imprisons , stifles , warps the Soul ! What did I leave behind ? Deceit , Betrayal , prejudice 's voice , The persecution of the mobOr glory , triumph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life as meaningless , shameful , enshrouded as it was with so-called fame . He walked the floor of his lonely room , sat down again and wrote :  |p182Zemfira  : But there are mighty mansions there , And many colored carpets tooAnd games and merriment and feasts , And maidens clad in rich attire .. . The idyllic life between Zemfira and Aleko lasts blissfully for several years , till she falls in love with another man . Aleko comes upon her in his arms and kills them both by stabbing . Zemfira 's father banishes him from the gypsy band . Leave us , proud man . Away , be gone . We are wild people without laws . We punish not with pain or death . Your blood , your groans we do not need ; But we ca n't brook a killer here .. . You were not born for freedom 's ways Begone , and peace be with your Soul . The gypsy band leaves Aleko , the civilized Russian man , alone and desolate on the steppes . With all of Pushkin 's romanticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gypsy life as Utopia . The battle always raged in him between romance and reality . On the one hand he saw himself standing firmly committed to change , and on the other was " God 's Will and the Emperor 's " and his implacable Fate ! This life of primitive bliss was at best transitory , ephemeral . In his epilogue he wrote : But even you , nature 's poor sons , Can not lay claim to happiness ! And in your tattered tents you dream Like other men , tormented dreams . Wandering through the steppes , you feel , Like other men misfortune 's blows . Everywhere passions wreak their illsAnd against the Fates there , there 's no defense . The poet did not , could not finish his GYPSIES all in one sitting . Too many things distracted him . But he was writing . He was writing ! And he was saying what he wished to say . He was consciously drifting away from the influence of Lord Byron . Some days he would work all through the night and fall asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the floor , the papers scattered . And hours later when he awoke , with bloodshot eyes he would reread what he had writtenand wonder agonizingly how he could have written such tripe , such unadulteratedexcrement ! At other times , he would marvel over the words his weary mind had wrought . And he would laugh aloud and sometimes weep over a beautiful and just-right word , a phrase , a clause , an entire stanza . " That 's it ! That 's it ! By the Holy Virgin , there is no other way to do it , say it ! " Every time he sat down to his desk , he profoundly felt a sense of mission . He would show them what magic thep183great-grandson of an African prince could work with the Russian language and its literature . He would excel . He would teach them how to read and write ! GrandmamaHannibal was often on his mind these days . She had gone to her eternal rest now , but she had charged him with a great mission and responsibility . Ivan Riznich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riznichna , was a Dalmatian grain merchant . Her father was an Austrian banker . The only possible problem of a liaison with a married lady was the trifling inconvenience of a pesky duel  --  that is , if one were indiscreet . In this kind of an affair of the heart and bedroom , no other obligation was expected or intended . A situation accepted amiably by wealthy husbands of the nobility . Amelia Riznichna was a slim elegant woman with dark sparkling eyes  --  wide , staring and intelligent  --  and long black hair . At the theatre one night , Alexander Sergeievich had stared at her distractedly with his opera glasses till her pink cheeks turned as red as apples from the province of the Don Cossacks . Monsieur Riznich was not unaware of Pushkin 's eyes upon Amelia , and he felt proud that his wife was beautiful enough to attract the obvious stares of such a famous and notorious roue as A. S. Pushkin , the dashing Don Juan of the written word . They met at the end of the second act as Alexander Sergeievichsat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath a soft spring night that had come unusually early to Odessa-by-the-Black Sea . As he watched her coming down the steps toward him , he sensed an eerie feeling of d:121 vu , though he knew in fact he 'd never seen her before . Yet somehow he also knew what she would sound like when she spoke . He would know he 'd heard her voice before , somewhere sometime perhaps in some distant dreams he 'd dreamt . Her voice would be deep and rich and resonant and musical . It would make him think of cellos playing Mozart music . Pushkin leapt to his feet as she walked toward him . As if by previous arrangement , one of her coterie of young gallants stepped forward and said , " May I have the pleasure to present to you , Madame Amelia Riznichna ? And to you , Madame , may I present Monsieur Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin ? " The flustered Pushkin bowed and said , " I assure you it is my pleasure , Monsieur , for which I shall be eternally indebted to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has our esteemed poet enjoyed the play thus far ? " Amelia Riznichnaasked coquettishly . Her voice was like a symphony composed especially for cellos . Fundamentally , Alexander Sergeievich was bashful , and he covered up his shyness with an air of savoir faire and worldliness . " Madame , there was nothing on the stage as magnetic as was in the Riznich box . " He replied . " You are a magnificent distraction . Blame yourself as I know nothing of what was happening on the stage . " Her eyes were dark blazing busy bodies . They stared at him and looked away at the same time . Was she actually staring at him or at other folk in other places ? Her wide black eyes were deep and limpid and all angelic innocence , yet seemed top184hold in them all the knowing in the world . Every single hart of him , intellectually , spiritually , physically , knew an undeniable attraction to this lovely mystery of a woman . At the same time he felt like running for his worthless life . Women will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame burning in her eyes , and he was afraid it would consume them both if he ever got too close . But he knew he must get close to this woman who would probably change his life forever . Of an evening Amelia Riznichna was like a queen holding court , and there were many voluntary young slaves-of-love more than willing to pay court to her . She attracted young gallants like the nectar of a lovely flower attracted bees , especiallyone young wealthy landowner by the name of Yablonovsky . Sometimes Pushkin had to stand in line like a beggar supplicant as she sat on her queenly throne chair in her vast high-ceilinged drawing room . The chair itself was made of the very finest East Indian teakwood , hand-engraved , with a teakwood canopy overhead with intricate carvings adorning each side and extending downward from the canopy in arcs and curves . She sat there regally like a queen , submerged almost in silken goose-down pillows . The walls were hung in Chinese silk . It anguished Alexander Sergeievich to see so many jealous sycophants . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his will , he queued up along with all the other anxious would-be lovers . One night in her bedroom , he was complaining to her about another handsomeyoung upstart who had come into her drawing room as if he had some undeniableclaim on her affections . " How can we make love the way we do , my sweetheart , while you have anotherman believing you belong to him ? And yet I know somehow you do love me . When we make love I know it has to be the real thing for both of us . " He wanted it desperately to be real . " Yet I feel like killing those young upstarts when they act so familiar with you , as if they know you intimately . Tell me , what is Yablonovsky to you , Amelia ? " Her husband , Ivan Riznich , was on a business trip in Vienna . She whispered softly to him . " Be contented that you know I love you , and believe me , I love only you . " " But , " Alexander Sergeievich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's slept with you . " Do n't you worry about my sleeping habits . You have more important things to occupy your wonderful mind . After all , you know there is at least one other man I sleep with , and that is Monsieur Ivan Ivanovich Riznich , my most honorable husband . " The truth and sense she spoke did not mitigate the poet 's anguish . Indeed the reality of her truth deepened Pushkin 's agony . He lay there visualizing his Amelia in the arms of her husband whom he saw as exercising the rights of property and ownership rather than the nobler rights of love and passion . He 'd never loved like this before . If only he had met her beforep185she married Runic h . If only ! Fate was like God 's Will and the Emperor 's , the omnipresentmalevolent enemy . Fate would always victimize him . In his desperation he said , " Come away from this place with me , my beloved . Come away with me while he is in Vienna . You are just a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will hardly miss you . I can not live with the thought of you belonging to another man . " " But the Emperor would miss you , my pet . And where would we go ? You forgetthat you belong to Russia , and the Emperor is its ruler . You ca n't even go to Kishinev without the Czar 's permission . " " We could escape to Africa or lose ourselves together up in the Caucasus and live with the Circassian people . The Emperor could never find us . " He insisted . The poet realized that women were much more practical than most men imagined , especially men of the romantic persuasion like himself . She asked , mundanely , " How will we eat , Alexander Sergeievich ? " " We 'll live on wild grapes and game . And on our undying love , " he added . " And what about your writing ? " Even though he knew he lied , he said , " With your love , my dearest , I would not need my writing . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it so hard to be truthful . Without his writing he could not love or live . His life would be one interminable unbearable existence . And how well he knew it . YetShe kissed him fully on his mouth . " Oh my beloved , if it were only true . But without your writing nobody on this earth could live with you . Without your writing , even I should n't wish to live with you . " My sweet , courageous falcon , you are your writing and your writing is preciselyyou . " Amelia said tenderly . " There is no way on earth to tell where one leavesoff and the other begins . You are your ODE TO FREEDOM . You are your VILLAGE , you are your RUSLAN AND LUDMILA , yOU are your GABRILIAD . YOU are THE SOWER . Yourwriting makes love to me . It makes me warm all over . It makes me laugh , it makes me cry , makes me angry and happy . It makes me love , hate , shout for joy . It is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm holding in my hand . I adore every single part of you . " Her lovesome mouth gave way before the passion of his fullsome lips like softestrubber and ripened peaches , as he murmured , " I love you , goddammit ! I love you ! I 'm bewitched ! You 're a fever , you 're a madness , a sickness that I never want to be rid of ! I love you so much it frightens me ! " And he lost himself in the special smells of her tumescent breasts and arms and thighs , sighs and moans and groans of this woman who delightfully cast a spell on him as they made love as love was meant to be , but never meant for them . Sometimes he would sit all night with her among the silks and satins of her lavish boudoir smoking their Chinese pipes together , pipes she kept especially for them alone , sipping their special wines , and he would be intoxicated with feminine aromas of Oriental essences and occidental fragrances . She would be reading somep186part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular line or phrase , and a smile or laughter would light up her face , burst from her lips , or a tear would spill from her wonderously dark eyes , and she would reach toward him and kiss him longingly on his mouth , and ask him , " How on earth do you write so beauti-fully ? " One night he told her heatedly , " I suppose it has something to do with my love and admiration for the serf , the Russian peasantry . I hate serfdom in Russia and slavery in America and everywhere else on this unhappy earth ! The muzhik is the pure and unadulterated Russian . He is the most human of us all . And I love him for it . I love his invincibility . I love his instinct for survival . " They would talk far into the night , of war and peace and freedom and of art and literature , his poetry , his aspirations , his future . She told him she 'd be his and his alone some day , and soon . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freest , craziest , wildest truest kind of love in all this loveless earth . But Amelia knew her lover . Love would never be enough for this sensitive and sensual poet . Sure he needed love , physical , spiritual , intellectual love , but he needed also comradeship of his peers who held him in regard and loved him not just for his verses , but for himself . Someone to appreciate and criticize his creative efforts . Someone who respectedhim and whom he respected as he respected sweet Amelia . Amelia was becomingto him a grandiose sublime obsession . She was his loftiest , most magnificent of poems , an epic of his own creation . Sometimes he really thought that he could , would steal away to the Caucasus with her , or to Africa , if she would go with him , and let the world take care of its crazy self . She was a sickness in his blood that he cherished and adored , pampered and indulged . He felt aged at twenty-four and sorely pressed for time , especially when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much older than the actual years he had spent here on this Russian earth . He 'd had so very many experiences , there was n't time for so much living . They 'd always called him a genius , but sometimes he thought his genius was in the life he lived and how he lived it . He must have lived before . Was that not why Natalya Ivanovna used to call him the Old Man , even when he was only eight years old ? Life was here and now to grasp and live , with his Amelia . And death was breathing on their necks . One lonely night he wrote a poem to herTIS TIME , MY FRIEND . T is time , my friend , t is time ! The heart for rest is cryingThe days go by , each hour bears off , as if it 's flyingA shred of our existencewe two , we plan to live , But death may come , how soon ? And joy is fugitive.  |p187Not  happiness , hut peace and Freedom may be granted hereOn earth : This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave , I plan escape before the nightTo that remote repose of toil and pure delight . Alexander Sergeievich saw nothing in the country changing , not even himself . To the theatre almost every night , flirting with pretty flighty women , restaurant hopping from Kimitraki-the-Greek 's where the cuisine was fantastically excellent and renown to Cesar Automne , the Frenchman , a great admirer of Pushkin , who always kept the poet 's favorite Saint Peray champagne . It was a time when he made himself believe that he believed in art for it 's own precious sake , that he did not write to create a new vision for himself and humankind , that he was not THE SOWER of his former days when he was young and innocent . When GYPSIES was published , Vyazemsky wrote him , asking : " What is the purpose ? What does it mean ? " Pushkin answered , irritatingly , " You ask me what is the purpose of GYPSIES ? What should it be ? The purpose of poetry is poetry ! " Loneliness . Sometimes he thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the river of his loneliness . He dreamed one night he was back in Ekaterinoslav and was swimming across the wide Dneiper River stroke after stroke after stroke after stroke , and when he 'd almost reached that other shore , a great exhaustionsuddenly came upon him and he struggled against a raging tide , and asked himself , what is the sense of struggling ? If he reached the other shore , he would find nothing but a world of loneliness and alienation . Death would come as a welcomed stranger on a great white steed . No one would miss him . No one cared . Then just before the final gasping breath , he awakened , breathing convulsivelyshort quick breaths . And his happy heart was palpitating , and he was glad that he was still among the living . Two or three times a year he received letters from his brother and sister . He knew they loved him and revered him . He loved to write them letters in return . After a few months in Odessa , a familiar feeling of boredom came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrating games with him . Except for Amelia , there was no one to talk with , with whom to share his revolutionary fervor . So in desperation he turned to his evil genius of a cynic , Alex Raevsky , who was more than willing to accommodate . For a time Pushkin 's sole male comrade was Alexander Raevsky , who still fascinatedhim with the sinister doomsday aura that always surrounded him . He almosthad our poet mesmerized with his yellow snake-eyed appearance , his nihilisticapproach to everything . " The end of the world will be here any moment , and nothing can be done to change anything , so what is the use of trying ? What is the use of writing , thinking , working ? What indeed is the use of living ? "  |p188Sometimes  these sessions resembled seances . Alexander Sergeievich would blow out the candles and sit in the dark and listen to his nihilistic prophet . He would break into a sweat . Chills would move across his shoulders . Sometimes he even pretended to be frightened by Raevsky 's incantations . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's negativism . For Alexander Sergeievich was at heart an optimist despite his notorious postureas a sophisticated cynic . He wrote to change the world . He was , in fact , THE SOWER . He continually reminded himself that in his ODE TO FREEDOM , he had called on slaves to rise up and throw off their chains . In 1821 he wrote THE DAGGER , in which he extolled the use of violence as a legitimate weapon in the revolutionary struggle against tyranny . He believed in the inevitability of change and the responsibility of men and women to work for change . He gradually began to avoid the sneering Raevsky and sought the comradeship of Tumansky , who worshipped Pushkin as the " Russian nightingale , the Robin Hood of our literature . " It was Tumansky , Schwartz , and Varlaam with whom he made the rounds of theatre , restaurantand casino , where hundreds of civil servants , clerks , and such gathered each night to lose their rubles to professional gamblers who roamed all over Russia , sleeping through the day and taking advantage of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in the early morning , Tumansky and Varlaam and Pushkin sat in a booth at Cesar Automn 's consuming bottle after bottle of Saint Peray . Tumansky wore a blonde mustache like an elephant tusk . He stared across the table at Pushkin , worshipfully , with his wide blue eyes . " I simply can not understand you . You write like an angel just descended from the heavens , but your conduct is that of a common ordinary whoremaster . I mean , the way you wench and womanize is a national scandal . Sometimes I think you 're undeserving of your heavenly talent , the gifts the gods have given only you ! " Varlaam laughed , " He writes like an angel all right . An avenging angel . " Pushkin stared from one to the other of his drunken comrades . He oftentimes suspected that his so-called legendary sexuality was attributed to his African blood , even by such staunch admiring comrades as dark-haired Varlaam and blonde Tumansky . Even by his own devoted father . He remembered years ago when he was an innocent lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambermaid , Tatyana . He could hear his father as if it had been yesterday . " You hot-blooded African bastard ! No girl is safe with you . Not even your innocent sister ! " His father had threatened to send poor Tanya away . The frightenedboy had begged his father . " It was all my fault , Pa-pa ! " He had pleaded tearfully . He really had believed it was his fault , his hot African blood . In the end his pleading had prevailed , he 'd thought . Tatyana was retained . Then one afternoon , he had been going down the long hall of the rambling house and he had heard a scuffling in one of the many guest bedrooms . He had heard his Tanya 's voice.  | " Please , your Nobility ! Please ! Have mercy on inc . I 'm a good girl ! " " Shut up , you wanton bitch ! Do n't put on airs with me , you slut ! You think I do n't know what 's going on in my own house ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestling with his true love , tearing her dress from her . And he had wrestled his father all over the room . " Who is the hot-blooded bastard now ? Who is the hot-blooded African bastard ? " The memory made his heart beat faster . He looked around at both of his admiringcomrades . He said to Tumansky , calmly , " First of all , there are no such animalsas angels . I am a man , no more , no less , than any other man . I ruinate , I defecate , I fornicate . Especially do I love to make love with a lovely woman . Some men are carpenters like Joseph , that legendary cuckold of Biblical times . Some men lay bricks , some are cobblers . Some are stone masons . I happen to be a writer . I have the same needs as other men . I get lonesome in this Imperial banishment . I get bored almost to madness . I like the comradeship of lovely interesting women . My interest in women though , goes much much deeper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meat placed here on earth solely for the surfeiting of my libertineappetites . A woman is physical  --  yes . But a woman is also spiritual , intellectual . Perhaps , actually I should say I make love with women , because I only make love with women whom I care about , whom I respect , with whom I share something in common , literarily , politically , intellectually , spiritually , and last and perhapsleast of all , physically . " He laughed aloud at the look on Tumansky 's face . " Womanizing is a Russian tradition , especially among the jaded aristocracy . And who chases after more women than both of you , you whoring sons of bitches ? " He added , " And you do n't have an ounce of African blood in either of your veins . " And then there was the ever present problem of finance . The seven-hundredrublesdole from the government was a monthly payment that sometimes came across the silent steppes three or four months behind time . In Odessa , unlike Kishinev , it was not so easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and national identities . People in Odessa dressed decorously , and everybody knew who Alexander Pushkin was . He was a proud olive-complexioned , frizzlyhaired , sensual-mouthed , dark-eyed man , who went to the theatre in a black frock coat , frayed and buttoned tightly at the neck . Tight fitting trousers that shone so , you could almost see yourself in them . He always carried with him an iron-fisted cudgel , ostensibly " to strengthen my hands and wrists for future duels . " At the theatre , he heard voices . " Is that really Alexander Pushkin ? He 's so dark ! " Who in the hell did they think he was ? An Ethiopian potentate ? " They say he 's very , very rich . " " Why does he dress so shabbily then ? " I lend my money to the Emperor . " I certainlywould like to sleep with him . My husband would have something to boast about . "  | " They say he 's a foreigner , an African , not really Russian ! " " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " But he must be Russian . He was born in Moscow ! Moscow is the soul of Russia . " And there was no getting along between his chief , Vorontsov , and our impetuouspoet . Pushkin would not  --  could not  --  play the role of a sycophant , which was what Count Vorontsov expected of all who worked under him . Pushkin pictured himself an aristocrat on a level with the Count . And even above him , intellectually . Vorontsov was disposed at first , to be kindly tolerant and paternalistic toward the sayward boy , the celebrated African scribbler . He was prepared to be the poet 's patron , if Alexander Sergeievich would play the role of court jester or poet to the Court of Count Vorontsov . It would lend prestige to the Court . But there was no way this arrangement could have worked , since each man saw himself in a different light . Vorontsov saw Pushkin as a poverty-stricken African nobody , one of his numerous subalterns , while Pushkin saw himself as an intellectual aristocratwhose lineage went back as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pushkin as religiously as Czarist spies . There was an especiallypesky cabman who had taken him , on credit , out to the Odessa outskirts a few times to visit the camps of Gypsy friends . One day he broke into Pushkin 's hotel room while he was shaving , demanding his pay . Pushkin advanced toward the cabman , razor in hand . " Get out of my apartment , you impertinent bastard ! " Thinking Pushkin was going to slash him with the razor , the chubby cabman ran for his very life . It did Pushkin 's spirit little good to get a letter from Saint Petersburg , telling him that everybody was reading with excitement his poem THE FOUNTAIN OF BAKSHISARAI , based on his trip to the Caucasus and the legend of the lonely Khan . He answered his elated friend , Zukovsky : Thank you very much , and thank all my loyal friends in Saint Pete for me for the pains they take to make me a famous man . It is unfortunate though that one can not eat fame or popularity , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hope those to whom you have so generously given my manuscript will see fit to buy the printed versionwhich , hopefully , will be published shortly . You probably think it vulgar of me to aspire to make a living from my writing . But it is after all , my life 's work . Nothing more . No more no less than to expect a cobbler to make a shoe and give it to one and all free of charge . I am vulgar . I write from inspiration . But like the cobbler , I expect pay for my product . Then one cold day word came across the hushed white steppes from Saint Petersburgthat changed the course of literature , changed the attitude of the Russian writer toward himself and his creativity ; Prince Vyazemsky had sold THE FOUNTAIN to a publisher for three thousand rubles , the largest sum ever paid to a writer in the history of Russian literature . People in Odessa looked at the poet differently . Sud/denly overnight he became their topic of polite conversation . He was like their hors d'oeuvre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few days passed before he did anything with his sudden fortune . He would sit in his simply furnished room with iron bed , a waterstand in a corner with waterbowland pitcher , a looking glass above the stand , two chairs , bare floor , his flat trunk in another corner , a writing desk , heavy inexpensive drapes at a single window , two inexpensive pictures on the walls . He sat and stared , unbelieving , at the bountiful draft of rubles and the letter from Vyazemsky . It was true he 'd made literaryhistory , and he was profoundly proud . He was ecstatic . He had turned a cornerin his life . As proud as he felt , he warned himself not to take his sudden celebritytoo seriously . He promised himself he would always take his work , his art , more seriously than he 'd ever take his fame , which could easily change to infamy . An artist who took his notoriety more seriously than he did his art would always be in trouble with his muse.  |p192Pushkin  's creditors made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning he went to the window of his hotel room where his creditors had gathered outside in the square , as usual . But this day was special , because the news of his good fortune had spread far and wide . All of his creditors , some he had long ago forgotten , were on hand . He paid them off by throwing rubles from the window to them . The first one to be paid was the insistent cabman . The people in the street shouted , " Pooshkin ! Pooshkin ! Pooshkin ! Long live Alexander Pooshkin ! " Three nights after he received his monies , he sent 360 rubles to Papa Insov . His letter said , in part : " I am ashamed and humiliated to have been unable to pay you before , and the simple reason is , that I have been kopekless . " He sent a draft of four hundred rubles to his family in Mikhailovskoye . He indulged himself by purchasing a new outfit of clothing in the latest most expensive style . But no matter that Pushkin became poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , and he could not help being proud of it . He felt warm and good about himself , and it lifted his dragging spirits and carried them aloft long after the money from THE FOUNTAIN had run dry like the legendary Fountain itself . His Amelia was also proud of him ; she read Vyazemsky'sletter over and over , and she wept for joy ; they made love as love had never been imagined . A copy of THE FOUNTAIN lay unopened on his desk in his hotel room since the day it had arrived . He had resisted a compelling impulse to pick it up and open it and read it from cover to cover . He walked around it , warily , as if it were a deadly cobra poised to strike out at him . He wanted to savor this ecstatic feeling of literary omnipotence as long as the taste of it endured.  |p193Then  one day he could resist no longer . He began to read IIIE FOUNTAIN and the depression descended upon him , almost immediately . When he came upon a line he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh no ! How could How could I have ever written anything so fraudulent and trite ? " And he sank deeper into his indulgent gloom . His head began to ache . When would he ever learn to write expertly ? The poet 's spectacularly growing prestige and popularity did not improve the relations between him and Count Vorontsov . If anything they worsened . Each of them kept their hostility to themselves , though each was well aware of their mutualanimosity . Vorontsov cordially invited Pushkin to all the formal affairs of the court  --  the dinners , banquets and receptions . Pushkin attended , bored to distraction , though he accorded Vorontsov a cool politeness and was treated civilly in return . Each man was too sophisticated to display his truest feelings toward the other publicly . This outward show of civility was not participated in by one of the few nonBritishsycophants attached to Count Vorontsov 's court . A Russian by the name of General Skobelev . Inadvertently , Pushkin had come across a letter written by the General to the Central Authorities in Saint Petersburg which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treats the young African scalawag too kindly . Pushkin 's subversive works should be forbidden to be published . Instead , the author of these perfidious verses should have a few strips of flesh removed from his behind with a knout dipped in heated glue . It would teach him the lesson he sorely needs . " Pushkin thoroughly despised this Russian lackey who was a willing errand boy for the British gentlemen of Court and willing to curry favor even if it came to kissing their English backsides . The unwritten peace pact between Pushkin and Vorontsov continued for a time . In fact it lasted until Pushkin went to visit Amelia one evening and was met with an empty house and a steward who told him that Madame and Monsieur had left the country for Italy . Alexander Sergeievich could not believe his hearing . " But when did they leave ? How long will they be gone ? " " It does n't seem they 'll ever return , your Highness . They have arranged for the sale of the house , the furniture and everything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to believe him , but his pounding heart and the hardness in his stomach knew the steward spoke the truth . His beloved had deserted him . He was through with love and women and trust and friendship , for all times . He turned quickly from the steward and made his way back down the marble steps . Odessa was already becoming a terrible lonely experience for him . He felt a stranger in this place . It was spring , but he felt cold like winter , hotter than the burning days of mid-July . The sweet taste in his mouth had swiftly turned to bile . He walked , stumbling , blinded by his tears . As he walked toward town , the ground beneath him was like shiftingp194desert sand . Amelia gone  --  forever gone ! Gone ! Here was one whom he loved and who truly loved him and understood him and adored him and valued him . And she had left him without even saying dosvadanya ! Gone ! Gone ! People on the dusty street turned and stared at this famous poet talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note for him from his Amelia . This has happened so suddenly my dearest , there was no time to say goodbye and kiss your sweet sensuous mouth and your beautiful expressive eyes , but be sure I shall return to you if you will have me and we will go away together . Nothing can keep me from you except death itself . . . I am yours ! Yours ! Forever  --  Your AmeliaThat night he got raging drunk , loud and boisterously inebriated . When he imbibed , every man was his friend and brother , even Emperor Alexander , maybe . But this night he got evil-drunk . He went looking for a fight . And found one at Vorontsov 's palace . He had been drinking since around six or seven o'clock , when he remembered the Vorontsov party . His vodka advised him to attend . When Monsieur A.S . Pushkin was announced , there was a murmur through the crowd already gathered , as if His Imperial Majesty Alexander Romanov Himselfwere honoring them with His august presence . All eyes turned toward the entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet , which was how he saw the " swaggering African scribbler . " The intellectual elite of Odessa immediately gravitated towards him . Pushkin was standing in a corner of the brilliantly lighted salon in the midst of his admirers , when he overheard a conversation that was probably meant for him to hear . One of the members of the Count 's coterie inquired , " I wonder why Yablonovskyis n't here tonight ? I am quite sure that he was invited . " " But , have n't you heard ? " another answered . " He left the other day for Italy . He left on the same ship with the Riznichs . " Alexander Sergeievich recognized the slimy voice of Skobolev . A great warmth gathered in his face and a knot doubled up his belly as he turned and stared directly into the sneering cat-grey eyes of Skobolev . A heavily powdered lady with a thin nose that seemed to have no nostrils gasped . " How thrilling ! How terribly romantic ! The days of chivalry still live in Imperial Russia ! " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet , " but it leaves many broken hearts in its wake , even famous Don Juan poetizers . There is a rumor that a certain scribbler who shall be nameless was madly in love with Madame Riznicha. "  |p195Pushkin  heard the tittering among his heretofore admirers . Alexander Sergeievichsaid calmly , deliberately , " Better to have kissed the sweet lips of a lovely lady than the buttocks of English gentlemen . " He turned and deliberately stepped on the big feet of the General as he heard the gasps of a few ladies of delicate constitutions . " Excuse me , General , but then you are used to men using you for a footstool , are n't you ? " As upset and inebriated as Pushkin was , he knew exactly what he was doing . " And now , " he said to the General , " will you go over there and fetch me a glass of champagne like a good boy , or do you just run errands for those who speak the English language fluently ? " Skobolev 's face first turned scarlet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this insult . " " Pardonez moi , Your Excellency . I did not realize it was possible to insult lickspittlessuch as you . I do beg your humble pardon . " Enraged , the General lost his nonchalance completely . Unlike an ennobled gentleman of the Russian Army and the Court of Vorontsov , he charged toward Pushkin like a wild bull on a lonely steppe . Pushkin nimbly stepped aside but left his right foot there long enough for the General to trip over it and fall on his fat face . An even larger crowd of gentlemen and ladies gathered quickly . Pushkin cooly helped the General to his feet , and with the deepest show of sympathy he said , " Come now , comrade . That 's no way for a General in his Imperial Majesty 's Army to conduct himself . It 's not aristocratic , definitely not comme it faut , You should never lick boots in public . Even so , my own boots do not need polishing . " The General pulled himself away from the smiling poet . " Monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was shaking like he suffered from the mad dance of St. Vitus . Arrangements for the duel were made , but Vorontsov interceded and promotedSkobolev out of the province . The night of the Skobolev incident was the night that Alexander Sergeievich met Eliza Vorontsova , who took the place of Amelia Riznichna in his broken heart . Two situations stepped up the tensions between Vorontsov and Pushkin and brought the undeclared war out into the open . One , the insult to his Russian general , his favorite and favored lackey . The second , which really pushed it over the precipice , was our poet 's affaire de coeur with the beautiful Eliza Vorontsova . This Ivan Ivanovich had the nerve to start an illicit affair with the First Lady of Odessa . Damn his savage soul ! Vorontsov would show him . Other men of the ennobled gentry would have been flattered by the infamous poet 's attentions to their wives . He would get rid of this ungrateful rascal . He began a series of letters to influential gentlemen in Saint Petersburg . " Get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought out in the open , Pushkin 's ammunition was his epigrams , his weapon was his goose quilled pen . He went immediately on the attack . The epigramswent the rounds of Odessa . His first shot was a biblical reference.  |p196David  was a little man , But he did vanguish Goliath , Who was a very big general And little more than a Count . His second shot was : Half milord , half tramp , Half sage , and half hick , Half bastard now , but one presumes thatHe will make a whole one yet . Biblical legends and epigrams were one thing , but in an open all-out war like this , Vorontsov had the most powerful guns and ammunition and was in charge of all the rules of warfare . Therefore the cards were heavily and unevenly stacked against the poet . And even God , Fate , His Majesty , and/or circumstances seemed on Vorontsov 's side . A plague of locusts broke out on the southern steppes of Russia . Thousands of locusts descended like a greenish-yellow storm cloud upon the corn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops . The Russian breadbasket faced starvation and disaster . Vorontsov sent an inspection detail chosen from his underlingson the very lowest rung of his imperial ladder , and in the scheme of things , Pushkin was naturally chosen as a member of the team to go and investigate the damage being wrought by these malicious grasshoppers . Our infuriated poet was given the following orders : You are to visit the districts of Kherson , Elizavetgrad and Alexandria , and obtain the following information in each town : Where have the insects landed , in what numbers , what action has been advised to exterminate them and how has it been followed up . You are also to inspect the places which have been badly affected by the invasion , evaluatethe effectiveness of the methods of clearance being employed , and consider if the measure adopted by the Provincial committees are adequate . Your observations are to be submitted to me personally in a written report . When Pushkin received the written order , he reread it over and over again as he held it in his trembling hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel quarters . He had never considered the seven hundred rubles stipend as a wage for his working for His Imperial Majesty 's Government , but as subsistance monies for his survival while in banishment . He went from agency to agency trying to get the grasshopper order rescinded , and though many sympathizedwith the poet , he soon found that the center of gravity was at the court of milord and that the Count 's word was law , against which there was no appeal . In desperation Pushkin even invaded Vorontsov 's court , went to Secretary-General Kaznacheev , a sympathetic man who admired Pushkin and delayed the execution of the orders as long as possible , so much so that Vorontsov threatened to send the Secretary General along with the delegation.  |p197Pushkin  burst into the room of Prince Veigel , a man recently from Saint Petersburg and in Odessa for a brief visit . Prince Veigel ranked high in the echelon of His Majesty 's foreign ministry . " I wo n't go ! " Alexander Sergeievich declared . " Let them shoot me ! Hang me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that Anglo-Russian egomaniac ! " Prince Veigel made an appointment with Vorontsov and went to see him to intercede on Pushkin 's behalf . " The sensitivities of a poet of Pushkin 's genius and temperament must always be considered in cases of this nature . " At Veigel 's first words , Vorontsov 's face lost color , his cheeks began to twitch , his thin lips trembled . Veigel feared that the Count might begin to froth at the mouth . " My dear friend , if you wish to preserve the friendship between us and our families , do not mention the name of that African scum in my presence . " He paused to get himself collected . " And the same goes for his friend Raevsky . " His few trusted friends finally persuaded Pushkin that he must go , and the poet went along with the others and watched the locust fighters standing waist deep in the yellow hissing giggling mass . The locusts clung to his clothes , whisperedstupidities into his ears , kissed his thick lips , took up light housekeeping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his senses , drove him to a decisionthat he would live with for the remainder of his days . He decided to resign from the employ of His Majesty 's government , which was an arrogant and ungratefulact tantamount to inviting great God up Above to kiss his hindquarters . Upon his return to Odessa from the locust-ridden steppes , Pushkin submitted the following written report to Count Vorontsov : The locusts were flying , flying , flying , Then the things came down to earth , They crawled , they ate up everything , And then the things flew off again . He then wrote a letter of resignation from the service , which he addressed to Kaznacheev , the Secretary-General of the Odessa Mission . For seven years I have had no official dealing with any superior . I have not written a single report till now . These seven years have been wasted as far as promotion and developmentare concerned . Any complaints on my part would be unseemly . Writing is my profession , and it gives me a living and an independence . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may be told that I am receiving a salary of seven hundred rubles and must continue to serve . I have accepted those seven hundred rubles not as a salary of a civil servant but as compensation paid to an exiled slave . I am ready to give them up the moment I cease to be master of my time and activities . If I had wanted to serve , I should have asked for no better chief than His Excellency ; but feeling my total incapacity , I do hereby renounce all advantages of a diplomatic careerthat His Most Imperial Majesty , Czar Alexander , has so graciously bestowed upon me.  |p198One  more word . Perhaps you do not know that I suffer from aneurysm . I have been carrying my death inside me for eight years . Any doctor will give me a certificate . Is it not possible to leave me in peace for the short time I have still to live ? The aneurysm was fraudulent . He had a not too serious case of varicose veins in one leg , but he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dire need for resignation and retirement from the service . Upon receiving the letter , Kaznacheev hastened to Pushkin 's hotel room in a desperate attempt to persuade Pushkin to take the resignation back . He had not yet shown it to Count Vorontsov . " Please ! Take this letter back and destroy it . I will not breathe of it to a soul . Think of the consequences . How will His Imperial Majesty react to such a display of impertinence , no matter how innocent the inten-tions ? " Alexander Sergeievich was adamant . " I appreciate your concern , though I do not understand your fear of the consequences . I aspire only for my independence . " " But what will you do ? How will you live ? " " I shall live by my writing , " Alexander Sergeievich replied . " I have already overcome my repugnance to sell what I write . As I continue to maintain , I write only by inspiration , but once written , it is merchandise to be sold for a price like a cobbler who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a working man whose trade is the written word . " Kaznacheev was one of the few men in Vorontsov 's service who genuinely admired the poet and his work . " But Count Vorontsov will be infuriated . He 's sure to take it as a personal insult . " The Count would be no more infuriated than Pushkin was at this point . The poet answered , in a calm voice , " Yebat ! Count Vorontsov ! I 'm sure he 'll discredit me in the opinion of the public . But yebat public opinion too ! I care as much for the opinion of the public as I do about the adulation of our critics and our journalists . Meanwhile Pushkin 's affair with Eliza Vorontsov went apace , even intensified . He spent many blissful moments with Eliza and Princess Vera Vyazemskaya , his Petersburg friend 's wife who was in Odessa for a short vacation . The three went on picnics at a cavern by the sea . As the surf came in and lashed the rocks , he read his poetry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . Princess Vera Vyazemskaya wrote many letters to her husband ; in each she mentioned the " mad ... impetuous " poet . " Poor Pushkin , nobody seems to understand him and it 's all his own fault . He seems to think the world is against him because of his meager African blood . He insults the most important people and imagines they 've insulted him . I do not know what the end will be for him . He is so gentle and charming when he wants to be . At these rare moments he is utterly irresistible . But if he continues on the course he now pursues , he is surely headed for tragedy . "  |p199Even  as he professed his love for Eliza , he knew that it was Amelia who lay heavy on his heart , in his dreams and remembrances . She was always with him . Eliza reminded him of darkly beautiful Amelia  --  the dark-to-blackness of her large wide eyes , like smoky topaz , the sensual lips , the sincere interest in his poetry , in literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's resignation to Saint Petersburg , along with a covering letter which requested Foreign Minister Count Nesselrode to come up with a solution that would send the rascal out of Odessa and out of Vorontsov 's jurisdiction . " There are too many people here who flatter his enormous vanity and encourage his stupidities . They acclaim him as the world 's greatest writer and he believes it . In the summer there will be more of them , and instead of learning and working , he will go even farther astray . " In another rather desperate letter the Count wrote : I repeat my plea . Deliver me from Alexander Pushkin ; he may be a fine young man , an excellent poet , but I do not want him around any longer , either in Odessa or in Kishinev . Pushkin meets too many flatterers here , who praise his works and foster his illusionof literary omnipotence , whereas he is still no better than a feeble copy of an extremelydubious original , Lord Byron . And please do not send him as close by as Kishinev where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there and shower adoration upon this undeserving African scoundrel . He is spoiled enough already . When the news of Pushkin 's resignation reached Saint Petersburg , his friends were furious with their irresponsible genius . They competed with one another in condemning him . " He 's impossible ! " ... " It 's all his fault ! " ... " God knows what will happen to him now ! " ... " It 's that terrible African temperament that always gets him into trouble ! Prince Vyazemsky wrote his wife : " I am really very unhappy for him , even though he is obviously at fault . However , people who do not know how to respect genius such as his , though it be the genius of a madman , are necessarily themselves in grievous error . " Then there was a letter intercepted by the postal service , in which Pushkin went into a lengthy satiric discussion of atheism and took a position unequivocably against the existence of a Superior Being and the immortality of the soul . When one died that was the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some men were less than cockroaches . Cockroaches did not go to Heaven . When you stepped on one , that ended it . The letter was brought to the immediate attention of the sanctimonious Czar Alexander the First . While Vyazemsky , Zukovsky and Turgenev were scurrying around in Saint Petersburg trying to salvage as much of Pushkin 's hide as was salvageable , CountessEliza Vorontsova was spying on her husband 's correspondence for some idea of what fate held in store for her beloved poet.  |p200Pushkin  tried vainly to borrow rubles from Princess Vera Vyazemskaya and involve her in a plot to board a ship in the harbor and escape the confines of the Empire . He 'd go anywhere . Africa , China , Europe  --  any goddamn-where ! Why should he have to live the remainder of his life in this prison that was Imperial Russia ? One week later a letter came across the grassy steppes from Count Nesselrode by the authority of His Imperial Majesty . Pushkin was to be immediately relieved of his official duties , taken off the Imperial payroll , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reside on his great-grandfather 's estate and there to remain under Imperial and clerical surveillance until further notice . His route to Mikhailovskoye was outlined in the official letter and rubles were allocated to him for the expenses of the trip . It was a long trip ahead . Mikhailovskoye was more than 1600 versts away to the north . When the orders arrived , July 29 , Count and Countess Vorontsov were on a holiday in the Crimea . Acting Governor Guryez summoned Pushkin , and inside of fifteen minutes he had received his orders , the designated route of journey , 389 rublesand five kopeks for expenses and the hiring of three horses . He had twenty-four hours to depart . Alexander Sergeievich had thought that when and if his resignation were accepted , he would be free to do his work anywhere he chose to do it . Perhaps he would go to Africa . Or Paris . Or Peking . But he was exchanging one prison for another , even worse , a dungeon . At least in Odessa there were the theatre , the opera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being sentenced to a Russian village in the middle of a wilderness . He would not even be able to bid his beloved Eliza goodbye and would probably never see her ever again . It was too much ! It was devastating . He went again to Vera Vyazemskaya and again he begged the princess to help him in a plot to board a ship for other parts . But as much as she loved the poet , she was even more fearful of the Emperor 's wrath should he find out that she helped him in any way to escape Imperial punishment . When Prince Vyazemsky heard of the poet 's fate , he was filled with righteous indignation . He wrote : Who is the author of this cruel indignation ? It is capital punishment to bury a sharp intense young man in the solitude of a desolate Russian village . ... Do the people who made this decision realize what it means to be exiled in a Russian village ? A man would have to be an angel not to go completely out of his wits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications would provide for him a livelihood for a few years anyway . Tell me , for the love of God , how the cudgel of Peter the Great could fear the prose and poetry of a mere child ? The fine old tree of orthodoxy is full of sap and blossomingabundantly . If Orpheus himself were to appear and intone a subversive chant , none would budge a single inch . All the poets in the world could howl their lungs out , nobody would hear a sound . The Titans did not sing hymns to the Gods when they wanted to drive them out of Heaven.  |p201The  shaken poet had to pack hurriedly . He kissed Princess Vyazemskaya a warm passionate goodbye and gave her another kiss for his beloved Eliza in the Crimea . Along with his clothing he packed his manuscripts : THE DEMON , TO THE SEA , TO THE FOREIGN LADY , IMAGINARY CONVERSATION WITH ALEXANDER I , the beginnings ofa new poem about Saint Petersburg as he remembered it , and the first two chapters of a new novel in verse with which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His working title for it was EUGENE ONEGIN . On the thirtieth of July , he left Odessa in a daze and began his long journey toward the isolated Russian village that was n't even on the Imperial map . All day long the telega moved across the black and sandy rutty roads surrounded by whirls of black dust covering everything within its wake . He lived that first day with the taste of black sand in his mouth , felt its thick grime on his face , in his nostrils and his ears . He felt it creeping up the sleeves of his tunic and into his sweaty armpits . The next day they moved over the inevitable rolling grassy steppes beneath a mercilesssun , a blue diaphanous sky , a hot purplish haze that steamed up from the greenish earth . And far away he shook his head at the wonder of the endlessness of the steppes , versts after versts of it . And off to the north where the sky came down to meet the end of the earth , which men called the horizon . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steppes seemed afire with pinkish heather . It was early evening now , and the pungent scorchy smell of wood smoke reached his pointed nostrils from the isolated villages half hidden by the tall grass and the sparsely scattered spruce and poplar trees . He could see the thatch-roof huts , the isbas , sending up wispy smoke signals to indifferent Gods of Holy Russia . The poet thought , these steppes and the people here had seen so much suffering . Foreign conquerors have swept across these plains throughout the centuries . Swedes , Poles and Teutonic hordes from the West ; Mongols , Tartars from the East . Time and time again . He closed his eyes and he could hear the groans and weeping , hear the clash of hammered steel , the swish of arrows , roar of cannons , the clatter of Arabian steeds . How many times had he been questioned , how could he write so beautifully , with so much verisimilitude ? Where did he get his insight , which seemed to have eluded so many writers before him ? As he wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did have a special insight into the Russian psyche , especially the lowly muzhik , because , like the land of his great-grandfather , his own Mother Russia had been raped by many nations ; men from strange lands had come uninvited . Strange men who had scorned the people , considered them barbaric . His dark eyes filled . How long would God and Fate bring damnation down upon this Russian earth and her long-suffering people ? How long would there be nothing for it ? This day it was blazing hot . Horseflies clung to the lathered horses . The coachmancursed when the horseflies mistook him for a beast and bit him.  |p202They  spent that first night in Nikolayev . Nc shared his supper with cockroachesthat leaped about like locusts . The next day they changed horses at a postingstation in Charnigov and stopped again for the night . The next morning , while walking through the hotel lobby , he met a young man . Pushkin asked him , " Are you from the Tsarskoye Selo Lycee ? You seem to be wearing the uniform . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whom he mistook for a common hotel porter . Pushkin wore a red Moldavian cape , full blooming trousers with matching color , yellow shoes and a Turkish fez with yellow tassel . He carried a big staff with an iron crook on the end like those used by shepherdson the steppes . When he traveled he always dressed like someone from the East , a Tartar or an Uzbek . " Yes , " the boy answered curtly , " though I do n't see how it could possibly be any concern of yours . " " Well , " the unsightly character almost shouted , " so you must know my brother , Leo . " Leo should have graduated long before . He had been drummed out of one school years before , had spent three pointless years in the Russian army , then had gone back to study at Tsarskoye Selo . The boy was taken aback , and spoke more civilly now . " What is your family name , sir ? " " Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin . My brother , Leo , graduates this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a jest ! You could n't be  --  " Pushkin said , " Yes  --  , I  --  " " You 're not the Alexander Pushkin , the poet ? " Alexander Sergeievich 's face flushed with embarrassment . " I was one of the first students to attend the Lycee , " he told the excited lad quietly . " Excuse me , Your Excellency , for not recognizing you . You are the most favored , the most famous alumnus of the Lycee ! We adore you ! We love you ! We know your verses all by heart ! Ach ! I 'm talking to Alexander Pushkin himself in person ! " Embarrassed even more , Alexander Sergeievich had begun to walk across the lobby toward the entrance where his telega was waiting . The excited lad ran after him . " Excuse me , Sire . But please do me the honor of signing your name on this piece of paper . No one will ever believe that I actually met you unless I have the living proof . " The boy kissed Pushkin on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left the nervous lad and continued on his journey to the north . Day after day , landscape after landscape they gained on Mikhailovskoye . One evening just at dusk , six days and many landscapes later , they came into the town of Mogilev . Alexander Sergeievich was looking around the town after having checked in at the only hotel for the night . He was so covered with dust he looked like an apparition come up suddenly off the eerie steppes . He was dressed pecu/liarly and yet he seemed familiar to a young military cadet who was passing on the road . " You do n't remember me , sir , but I remember you . " The cadet said . " You are Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin . I am Alexander Englehardt , the headmaster 's nephew . I used to come over to Tsarskoye Selo and you and Delvig and Pushchin used to make me recite poetry . " Pushkin embraced the young man and exclaimed , " I remember  --  I remember you very well , Sasha . You were a versifying cadet par excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told his friends and fellow officers that Pushkin was in town . They hurried back to meet the poet . It was as if they were having drinks with His Imperial Majesty , Alexander Romanov Himself , they were so overjoyed . They had dinner together and drank bottle after bottle of champagne . Englehardt kept repeating , " I ca n't believe it ! I simply ca n't believe it ! Imagine meeting Alexander Pushkin in the flesh like this ! People did n't believe I really used to know you ! " They drank to the health of everything they could think of , except the Emperor . They drank to revolution , to an end to serfdom , to constitutional democracy , an end to the monarchy . Alexander Sergeievich leapt up on one of the tables and began to recite his poetry . Their eyes were all alit with joyous adulation . Others in the dingy restaurant looked at them askance . The young officers took him in their arms and carried him kicking on their shoulders to their hotel , and continued downing bottles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " This is one of the most auspiciousoccasions we will ever experience in our lifetime . Let us celebrate by giving our famous friend a champagne bath as a proper bon voyage ! " Alexander Sergeievich was truly moved . The enthusiasm and adoration from the young men took some of the edge off his banishment which seemed everlasting . The youth of Russia loved him . He felt a wetness in his eyes . For after all , the youth were the future of Russia , the only hope that Russia could have a future . And change . His voice choked as he said , " Tovarischi , I appreciate profoundly your sentiments from the bottom of my heart . A brilliant idea . I can think of nothing more exhilarating than to splash about in a champagne bath , but time is against us , and I must get on . But let me leave you young comrades with this admonition . " Pushkin himself was only twenty-four , but he felt strangely ancient , so much older than his actual years . " Take the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But go all the way ! Make a people 's revolution . Do n't be content with a coup d'etat of the elite , which is so fashionable today in Europe . Liberate the Tadjik , the Finn , the Kalmuk , Tartar , Uzbek , the Don Cossack , the Jew , especially the muzhik , as well as the so-called Great White Russian ! Rally every Russian to the cause . Even the Circassians . It is left entirely up to you ! " His happy eyes conjuredthe image of little emaciated Nina inside the Pale near Kishinev . Nina ! With the largest darkest knowing eyes in all the world.  |p204It  was four o'clock in the morning . Daylight had already broken in the eastern skies when they went with him to his hotel room , helped him get himself collected , put him in the telega and bade the famous poet a rousing farewell . Sitting there atop his old dilapidated trunk in the rocky dusty telega , AlexanderSergeievich stared across the endless grassy steppe where the heat rose from the earth like waves of steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he equated with the future of his country . The young folk , the future of the nation , loved him . The older entrenched nobility hated him with an all-consuming passion . He was caught between a crossfire of students , young people , workers , peasants , some **25;16772;TOOLONG , lonely pedestal-placed women , some in far-off unknown unnamedvillages . A few ennobled literate gentlemen on the one hand , and on the other hand stood the wealthy businessmen , the entrenched intransigent aristocracy , counts , barons , princes and princesses , landed gentry , boyars , and on top of the pile the Holy One , Czar Alexander Pavolovich Romanov  --  all of whom hated the very sound of his name . Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin ! He came in sight of the steeple of the Svyatogorsk Monastery high on a hill , and he visualized the nearby cemetery on Holy Mountain where the bones of his famous great-grandfather lay buried with the busy worms . His face began to fill up against his conscious will , and a fullness now was moving through his shoulders . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimming distance the low-slung , wooden onestoryhouse of his great-grandfather . Now the telega moved irresistibly toward his past , which would be his future . His family would be there to greet him . Greet him , or just meet ? Well , they were his family for better or for worse . His brother and his sister loved him . He was their brother and a hero to them , though they lived precariously within the shadow of his name and popularity . He felt somewhat like the legendary prodigal son as he saw them all standing before the house beyond the little bridge , as it squatted there amongst a grove of pine and linden trees . It looked so lonely there among the trees . He was moved to pity for the proud little house constructed by his great-grandfather . It looked smaller than it really was , and lonelier , dwarfed as it appeared to be by the lordly domineering pines . The telega moved creakily and steadily beneath the giant pines with the storks atop the tallest trees making crazy noises like a howling wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bridge and the dried-up creek that ran underneath . He leaped from the telega and ran toward his mother with all her own self-hatred and confusion which caused her to deny him her unlimited affection . Against his stubborn will the tears spilled down his cheeks , and he took her in his arms and found that she was weeping too . She loved him , yes ! She loved him not . He was confused . He was upset . Yet he was somehow happy . He was home !  |p206While  the Pushkin family did not feast upon the fatted calf that first night in celebration of the return of their prodigal son , they did their best to make the prodigal feel at home with a veritable feast of shaslyked lamb , stchi ( cabbage soup ) , black caviar , salted cucumbers , sturgeon , kvas , wine , and vodka . He knew they must have sacrificed to prepare such an elaborate banquet . They were not wealthy aristocrats . So they must be genuinely glad to have their wayward son back . They loved him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was not easy to be related to Alexander Sergeievich Pushkin . His father was always confronted with : " You 're the man that sired the irreverent revolutionary rascal ! It 's your fault that you spared the rod and did not beat his arse enough when he was a boy . He must have been an unruly bastard ! " His mother always feared allusion to her African background . " It 's the African in him . He gets it from his mother 's side ! " Pushkin knew it was easier for his sister and brother because the youth of Russia worshiped him . Yet it was a burden for them also , since Olga and Leo were expected to spout energetic revolutionary verse at a given moment simply because they bore the name of Pushkin . Revolutionary genius was taken for granted . All these thoughts romped through his mind as he looked around at his family , the only one he would ever have until he made one of his own . And there were not many prospects for family-making on his part buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Imperial map . His old nurse , Arina Rodionovna , came shuffling into the dining room shouting , " Sasha ! My little Sasha ! " Her little Sasha picked her up and danced around the table with her . He insisted that she and Nikita Koslov , his valet , sit at the table and enjoy the feast with them . She had been his surrogate mother , which had al/ways been a source of superficial envy on his mother 's part . Nadezda Pushkina thought Arina Rodionovna did not have to bear the shame or blame of actual motherhood . Neither had she borne the pain . Even in this ancient house , the impecunious Pushkins were taken by the fatherthrough the charade of the wealthy aristocracy . Nobody sat until he arrived and took his seat at the head of the table . The servants always dressed in formal attire , with pomaded skull and powdered wig stood behind the chairs of the now seated family , serving equipment in hands , heads bowed , awaiting the master 's pious blessings on the household . Arina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession to the prodigal son . The next few days he walked around looking up forgotten places and stirring up memories of his childhood . He sat for hours outside the back of the old ramshacklewooden house staring at the Surot River that ran past . The Surot was more lake than river in its stillness and tranquility . They were drowsy sunlit days with no breeze stirring . Not even the leaves on the pine and linden trees were moving , as they stood still and quiet as if holding their breath for something to happen . Only the crazy sounds of the storks , perched at the very top of the lordly pine trees , broke the stillness with their shrill strange noises that sounded as if they were rattlingshutters to awake the sleeping world . The river itself was smooth and motionless , like a long flat piece of glass that you could see yourself in , and the sunlight bounced upon it like a thousand emeralds . He could see the reflections of the trees in the placid river seeming to grow in an upside down direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward in the river . The entire world seemed topsy turvy . Perhaps this was a true reflection of this old earth 's condition . He walked along the many paths that led from the old decrepit house . Hares scurried through the underbrush . The grass grew tall and unkempt here , and the world abounded with sunflowers . Opalescent butterflies flitting to and fro . Bees buzzing , grasshoppers hopping , darting through the highest weeds . He was intoxicatedby nostalgia and the pastoral smells of summer blossoms . He thought about his poem , THE VILLAGE . He remembered Natasha Ivanovna . He came upon an opening and stared at a great big black rock as it sat there in the middle of the clearing . He remembered the legend of the great black rock and his great-grandfatherand the serf girl who saw him sitting there one day , as was his habit . She had said , " Look at him sitting there with his black self on that black rock thinking all those black thoughts ! " Alexander Sergeievich was mesmerized as he walked toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to conjure up the old days when his great-grandfatherwalked this very Russian earth and thought all of those beautiful black thoughts . How he longed to have known his great-grandfather , the friend of Great Peter the One . He thought of his grandmother who now lay beside him in the quiet cemetery at the Monastery . He remembered all the stories she used to tellp208him , and the tears began to fill his eyes , and he promised himself he would one day tell the world the story of his great-grandfather . He spent many hours with his brother and sister , Leo Sergeievich and Olga Sergeivna , in earnest and long extended animated conversations , as if to make up for all the years they had been separated from each other . Their faces glowed with admiration for their famous brother . The love and reverence for him shone in their faces as they spoke with him of love and literature and revolution . They talked of childhood days in the old house on German Street in Moscow , the time he wrote his first play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having him with them . They hugged and kissed him , especially Olga Sergeivna . He welcomed it . All this love and adoration were like a balm that exorcised his sense of alienation . His father came to him one day after supper and put his fatherly arms around his wayward son . " Son , I ca n't tell you how proud I am of the way you 've changed into such a fine upstanding , outstanding and understanding young man . I never really lost my faith in you . They said it was the African strain in you that made you act the way you did . But I knew if you put your trust in the Holy Virgin , she would show you the light . And now that God and the Emperor have forgiven you , you can serve the Crown as your ancestors have before you . Who knows ? In the foreignservice you can become an ambassador . I ca n't tell you how proud I am of you . And now you can have a good influence on your brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lack of scholarship and engaging in revolutionarymischief . " His drunken father kissed him fully on his mouth . " I 'm dependingon you , my favorite son . You always were the apple of my eye . " He stared at his father and realized suddenly his father was aging . But he knew that every living thing on earth was aging . Even new-born babes were growingolder . But the wrinkles in his father 's face , the exaggerated jowls , and the even greater rims and bulges in his neck told him that Sergei Pushkin had crossed that Separating Line from which there was no turning back . The jowls would slacken even more . The wrinkles would increase , not lessen , as the days went swiftly by . He remembered his father slim and young and handsome . What was ahead for him ? The stiffening of his joints . Poor circulation , the hardening of his arteries , senility , if his father lived long enough . Tears began to fill the poet 's eyes as he thought against his will that his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Round , short , thick necked , short arms , with the steam issuing from his thin lips and pinched nostrils like tea boiling over . His father went on and on . " After all , you are my eldest son . They always said that you resembled me and had good sense just like me , the apple of my eye . The very apple of my eye ! And God and His Majesty have forgiven you . And so have I ! " He told his father sadly , quietly , " Father , the Emperor is not God . "  | " Not God ? Not God ? " Sergei Pushkin repeated incredulously . " Of course His Majesty is not God . God does not dwell here on this earth . The Emperor was given to us by God to take His place on earth . He is God 's presence here . He is the Voice of God . That is why we call Him the ' Little Father . ' Alexander Sergeievich said patiently , " Alexander Romanov is a very ordinary man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He urinates , he defecates , he fornicates just like any other human being . Much much more than most . His father said , " The Emperor is God incarnate . Like God , He works mysteriously . That is why He and God have forgiven you . " " But why ? I do n't even believe  --  " " We are not meant to understand . Our duty is only to obey God 's commandments , which He passes on to us through His Divine One here on earth , the Emperor . " His father seemed to lose track of the trend of his conversation with his prodigal son . He came toward him again and embraced him , kissed him animatedlyas again he declared , " You always were the apple of my eye . " Pushkin backed away from his babbling father . He had never thought of himself as the apple of anybody 's eyes . And while he relished , even treasured , this elaborate show of affection , especially from his father , he knew it had to be on his terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply was nothing else for it . And so against his will he heard himself say , " But , father , I have n't changed that much . The Emperor has not forgiven me . I do n't believe in the Immaculate Conception . And you might as well know it now . I am dismissed from the Foreign Ministry . In fact , I resigned . The Emperor despises me and the feeling is certainly mutual . " Sergei Pushkin stumbled away from his son with a look on his face as if he had embraced a leper and was contaminated . " Why do you always have to spoil everything ? Why ca n't you accept generosity and forgiveness ? " " But you must know the truth , my father . The Emperor has not forgiven me . He has imprisoned me in this godforsaken place . And I love you too much to deceiveyou . " " Do n't you dare love me you , you , you African son of a swine ! And stay away from your innocent brother and sister ! " Sergei Pushkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot foam on the horses that had brought him to this place . " You 're trying deliberately to get your own father sent to Siberia ! But I 'll write a letter to His Majesty ! I 'll tell the world you are not my son ! I disown you , do you hear ? I disinherit you ! " Things became unbearable in the low-slung rambling wooden house . The tensionsbuilt up by the hour . Each day he heard his father ordering Leo to " stay away from that devil , Sasha , who will try to lead you into the evil ways of atheism and condemn you to hell 's fire for all your days before and after death . "
