The Triple Crown , still by any measure the most glamorous of thoroughbred racing events in North America , offers lucrative possibilities to those who are in the business of maintaining stallion operations . A victory in one or more of the Triple Crown races or - and hearts leap at this prospect - a sweep of the entire series , can transform a male thoroughbred into a virtual money machine. // The multiplier effect on a horse ' s valuation is impossible to calculate with precision , mainly because there are numerous variables involved beyond the result of a Triple Crown race or races . Among them are the perceived quality of the pedigree , the horse ' s physical appearance , the horse ' s record before the Triple Crown series and the reputation of the people involved in syndicating the horse for stud purposes. // The latter is perhaps even more intriguing than the other two factors because it brings humans into the equation . Liken it , if you will , to the sale of financial instruments to the public . The ideal investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to client needs , including a continuing relationship with the client after the sale is completed . Thoroughbred breeding operations follow much the same pattern : The farms with the best client base ( meaning access to the top players in the business ) , and the highest marks for maximizing a horse ' s stud potential by providing him with the best available opportunity , are the ones who get most of the business. // Two such operations are the Hancock family ' s Claiborne Farm in Paris , Ky. , and William S. Farish 3d ' s Lane ' s End Farm near Versailles , Ky . Claiborne is a Kentucky tradition , run by Seth Hancock , the third generation of Hancock men to operate a farm that has more than 3 , 000 acres and 29 stallions , among them many of the sport ' s bluest blue-chippers. // Racing ' s leading legend , Secretariat , is there , along with the supersires Nijinsky 2d and Mr. Prospector , and Avatar , Coastal , Conquistador Cielo , Damascus , Spectacular Bid and Tom Rolfe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Farish is , by Claiborne standards , a relative newcomer to the business , but he has established himself as one of the sport ' s key operatives , especially since the establishment of Lane ' s End as a stallion station three years ago . His chief coup was the syndication of the 1985 Horse of the Year and Kentucky Derby winner Spend a Buck for a sum said to be about $15 million for 40 shares , giving the horse a valuation of $375 , 000 per share . He has also purchased a half-interest in Tasso , last year ' s champion 2-year-old male and a solid Triple Crown contender before he suffered cuts in the Wood Memorial and had to be pulled from the Derby. // Both men agree that the Triple Crown is still the most important event for breeders in evaluating potential stallion prospects , although both say that the Kentucky Derby is the key to the kingdom . Says Hancock : " You are looking for precocious horses that can go and , say , run a mile and a quarter at 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sire whose sons have done well and a strong female family . Now , I think a horse that wins the Derby generally has been a good 2-year-old , indicating that he is precocious , and the Derby tells us that he can get a distance against other good horses. " // How does one value the Triple Crown races , individually or collectively , in calculating their financial impact upon syndication opportunities ? // Clearly , the Kentucky Derby counts more than the Preakness or Belmont Stakes in such an equation . Hancock was a part-owner of Swale , the 1984 Kentucky Derby and Belmont winner who died suddenly a week after the latter race . Swale had the credentials Hancock and Farish agree are essential for a horse to be considered as a top-of-the-line stallion prospect . He was well-bred , had excellent 2-year-old form and had indicated by winning the Florida Derby that he had trained well at age 3 , all of this before the Kentucky Derby. // Hancock says , " Swale was going to be a high-level horse before the Derby , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to his value . " He compared that to Snow Chief , the ' 86 Derby favorite , whom he estimated to be worth perhaps $6 million to $8 million going into the race , basically because his pedigree is not regarded as fashionable . But his value , too , would increase by about 50 percent as a result of a Derby victory. // The same is not true for victories in either of the other two Triple Crown races . " If a horse wins just the Preakness or just the Belmont , it doesn ' t materially increase his value , " says Farish . " Wins in other races , like the Travers , or a Breeders ' Cup race , can be about as important. " // Winning the entire series , which has only been done 11 times , totally changes the game . According to Hancock , a horse with a high-quality pedigree and good pre-Triple Crown race record , would have been worth perhaps $40 million after winning the crown a few years ago . However , the recent recession in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both Hancock and Farish estimated that a Triple Crown winner with anything less than an outstanding pedigree would probably be worth no more than $25 million today. // " Looking at the Triple Crown , we ' ve seen a real change in attitude , even concerning the top horse , the one who seems to have everything , " says Farish . " Today , that horse would probably be worth about $600 , 000 per share , $700 , 000 tops . Three or four years ago , the figure would have been $750 , 000 to $1 million . " Winning the Derby itself will make most horses worth about $14 million to $16 million ( about $350 , 000-$400 , 000 per share ) . // Even though the Derby remains the key race , industry observers agree that the Triple Crown , with a few changes , should remain racing ' s premier event . Additional purse money , a bonus for winning two or more of the races and movement of the Preakness and Belmont so that the three races are all three weeks apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farish . Regardless , the Triple Crown will still be of signal importance to breeders , and when the 1986 edition is completed , one , two or three horses will have become large capital gains for their owners , even if they are not Secretariat. //
