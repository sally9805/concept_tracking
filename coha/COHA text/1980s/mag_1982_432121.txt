 | After a year of frustration , the Reagan administration finally is making progress in persuading Arab nations to grant the U.S. a larger role in protecting the oil-rich Persian Gulf region . Moderate Arab states , once reluctant to move too close to the U.S. , now fear that revolution spawned in Iran could surge across the gulf ? and that without outside help , they might not survive . The result is a subtle but perceptible shift by Saudi Arabia and smaller gulf nations ? Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates ? toward closer military ties with the U.S. A full-scale U.S. military presence is not in the cards anytime soon . The Arabs welcome American arms , but they do not want American fighting men based in or near their countries . Still , indication that the U.S. is making headway in easing Arab suspicion came with Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger 's success during a swing through Saudi Arabia , Oman and Jordan in early February in securing Riyadh 's agreement to form a joint U.S.-Saudi military committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AWACS ( airborne warning and control system ) planes will remain in Saudi Arabia until the Saudis get their own Americanmade radar-warning aircraft , starting about 1985 . " Soviet hands . " In another effort to gain broadened support from Mideast nations , American officials say , the administration may ask Congress to lift its ban on sale of mobile air-defense missiles to King Hussein of Jordan . Angered by the congressional prohibition , Hussein has agreed to buy 20 batteries of surface-toair missiles from Russia , a purchase U.S. experts say could " drive the Jordanians into Soviet hands . " The accord with Saudi Arabia and an earlier agreement by Oman to provide the U.S. with military facilities raises U.S. hopes that it may yet be able to develop an informal defense arrangement including all moderate Arab states in the region . A major roadblock is Arab refusal to accept the American position that the Soviet Union is the biggest threat to the Persian Gulf oil fields . To the Arabs , Israel is their No. 1 enemy . But for reasons that have little to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulf Arabs are taking a second look at their reluctance to cooperate with the U.S. Behind the switch is Ayatollah Khomeini 's Iran . Not only do gulf Arabs fear that Teheran 's bogged-down war with Iraq could spill over into their vital oil fields , but there is evidence that Khomeini is spending millions of dollars trying to export his Islamic revolution into their countries . As evidence of their concern , Persian Gulf nations , at the urging of Saudi Arabia , have formed the Gulf Cooperation Council , which links the six countries into a working security pact . The GCC commits the states to defend one another from both external attack and internal subversion . The U.S. backs the move . " We have been urging them to do it for years , " says an American diplomat in Bahrain . " Now that the Iraq-Iran war and the Iranian revolution have them terrified , they finally are getting together . " Weinberger 's pact with the Saudis is an important sign that the U.S. is at last gaining a toehold in the eastern segment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forge along a crescent stretching from Kenya to the gulf to North Africa to fend off Soviet encroachment . Already in hand : Mombasa , Kenya . This East African city is the only attractive port of call in the area . America is spending about 48 million dollars to dredge the harbor to permit use by larger vessels . Ras Banas , Egypt . At Cairo 's suggestion , the U.S. agreed to expand facilities at this Red Sea port , which could be used by American troops in times of crisis . Congress cut to 14 million dollars an administration request for 106 million for surveys and construction . The White House now is seeking 205 million dollars more . Manama , Bahrain . In practical terms , this modest naval facility is the only operational center the U.S. possesses in the Mideast . A 70-man American land-support unit is allowed to service the five-ship Mideast fleet that cruises in the gulf . But the Bahraini government insists it is not a military base ; Americans keep a low profile . Masirah Island , Oman . Because Oman guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this former British outpost is probably the most important facility yet secured by the United States . Washington is spending 80 million dollars to upgrade Masirah 's airport and hopes to spend 100 million more on additional construction projects . Fully 40 percent of the non-Communist world 's oil springs from the Persian Gulf and moves through the windswept strait . Any disruption in that supply line would spell disaster to industrial nations in a matter of weeks . A lack of permanent bases compli- cates America 's defense of the Persian Gulf region . The major U.S. military force is the 20-vessel fleet in the Indian Ocean . But the British-owned island of Diego Garcia is the lone naval station for thousands of miles that is open to unlimited American access . " The Arabs want our protection , but they do n't want us in the region , " says a U.S. official . " And nobody has figured out how that is supposed to be done . " Yet the turn of events on the north shore of the gulf is making closer cooperation with the U.S. look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militarily weak Arabs . The 17-month Iraq-Iran war seems to be tilting in favor of Teheran . An Iraqi defeat could bring down President Saddam Hussein , put an even more radical government in the driver 's seat in Baghdad and sharply shift the balance of power in the Mideast . A still greater worry is the revolt that Khomeini 's supporters are trying to stir in the gulf 's conservative states . In December , a team of Iranian-trained guerrillas was arrested in Bahrain just days before it planned to attempt a coup . Other infiltrators have been nabbed in Kuwait , Qatar and the U.A.E. " Great Satan . " According to Iranian press reports , Khomeini has budgeted 18 million dollars this year to help spread his Islamic revolution to other nations . A leading target : Saudi Arabia , which Iranian authorities now equate with the U.S. as the " Great Satan . " As a result , gulf states are focusing largely on warding off subversion from Iran . They are determined , according to Bahraini Information Minister Tariq al Moayed , " to organize ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's goals : A unified air-defense system , an Arab-only rapiddeployment force and a billion-dollar defense fund to buy weapons from the outside and , eventually , to set up an Arab arms-manufacturing industry . " Any attack on us is an attack on the other five , " says Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheik Mohammed al Khalifa . But the combined fighting strength of the six is 135,000 men , barely half of what Iran already has in the field against Iraq . This , says a Western analyst , is a prime reason the Arabs may be easing their demands that the U.S. maintain only an " over the horizon " presence in the region . As an Omani official puts it : " The gulf states finally realize that they must organize against external threats . The U.S. role is the right thing at the right time , and it sends a signal to others to leave the gulf alone . " Life on the " Front Line " ? Months Of Tension at Sea Aboard the U.S.S. CONSTELLATION Here on this giant U.S. aircraft carrier patrolling the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Persian Gulf are a daily fact of life . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger got a firsthand view of the powder-keg nature of America 's security role just as he came on board for a brief visit on February 10 : Flashing monitors and radar screens warned that a Soviet I1-38 patrol plane from South Yemen and an Iranian P-3 surveillance aircraft had penetrated the 200-mile " security envelope " that surrounds the U.S. task force plying the waters at the entrance to the strategic Strait of Hormuz . Orders to scramble were barked to on-alert pilots of F-14 Tomcat fighters . Planes were catapulted off the deck into the air at an astonishing pace . Within minutes they could reach supersonic speeds of more than 1,400 miles an hour . Once spotted , the intruders flew off , and the Tomcat interceptors returned to this 84,000-ton ship . But there was no relaxation of the alert . Crewmen explain that Soviet and Iranian planes frequently make similar penetrations or buzz oil tankers steaming the Indian Ocean . " We intercept any aircraft approaching closer than 200 miles from our position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Combat Direction Center . At the same time , sophisticated equipment monitors other potential sources of danger , such as Russian ships . Submarines also operate in the region , but officers are hush-hush about the country they come from . The Constellation is one of about 20 U.S. ships patrolling sea-lanes leading to the Strait of Hormuz , gateway to the gulf ? an area known by the Americans posted here as " Gonzo Station . " The U.S. maintains at least one , and sometimes two , carrier groups in the Indian Ocean at all times . This carrier travels in a flotilla known as Battle Group Delta . Other ships in the force include a nuclear cruiser , two frigates , two destroyers , two oilers , a vessel carrying food and another carrying ammunition . The firepower and reconnaissance strength of the 75 aircraft on board is awesome . There are F-14s , A-6 Intruders , A-7 Corsairs , E-2 Hawkeye radar planes , antisubmarine craft and helicopters . A state of constant readiness gives the 200 pilots , 5,200 crewmen and 70 Marines aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dennis M. Brooks sends aloft five to seven patrol flights a day ? some 10 planes in each group . At the ready . Inside a ready room , pilots wait in full flight gear , prepared to rush to their planes when the alarm bells ring . Adding to the strain of perpetual alert : Long tours of duty at sea with no relief . With few friendly ports of call in the area , the ships of the Indian Ocean task forces are setting records for time at sea . The carrier Nimitz spent 140 straight days in the Indian Ocean ? the record . The Constellation is scheduled to remain in the area for seven months before returning to its home port at San Diego . One of the crew 's rare breaks so far was a recent five-day liberty call at Mombasa , Kenya , after 51 days at sea . Still , morale seems high . For all the tough demands , officers say , the men take pride in serving on what Weinberger told them is the " front line " if trouble erupts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
