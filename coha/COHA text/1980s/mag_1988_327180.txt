THE FOOL 'S PROGRESS <P> by Edward Abbey <P> Henry Holt ; 485 pages ; $19.95 <P> " Upon publication , " the publicity blurb wretchedly announces , " Edward Abbey will tour the following cities : Los Angeles , San Francisco . . . New York and Washington . " Why wretchedly ? Because Abbey loyalists do n't like to imagine their prophet  --  that grand old desert solitary , that North American champion of the ideological beer-can toss  --  getting anywhere near Los Angeles , New York or those other evil megaburbs . Somebody might package his crankiness for distribution in health-food stores , or subject him to relentless understanding on public TV . <P> A few decades ago , the author began working as a seasonal fire lookout and park ranger in outposts like Arches National Park in southeastern Utah . Out of these cherished stints of lonely brooding came such collections of marvelously cross-grained essays as Desert Solitaire and Abbey 's Road , and that wistful novel of eco-banditry The Monkey Wrench Gang . <P> Henry Lightcap , hero of the present novel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with the West as it used to be and waitresses and barmaids as some of them still are . He shares Abbey 's employment history , his age more or less ( late middle ) , his marrying habit ( Abbey 's present wife is his fifth ) and his sour gallantry . His position on beer-can tossing is the master 's : the highway is an abomination , and thus the litter that sullies it is a blow for truth and beauty . <P> Lightcap , alas , has fallen on bad times . His latest wife has left him for the usual good reasons , he and his job at the Tucson welfare office are irreconcilable , his charge-card credit has seized up , his old dog is fatally ill , and he has a gut ache that sounds bad . In this woeful condition he hits the highway , heading home to his older brother Will , who still tends the family farm in West Virginia . <P> Yes , folks , it 's mournful country music that makes your blue eyes water . Call it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a banjo , not a typewriter , is feeling sorry for his hero and probably for himself too . What saves the book is that he is skilled enough to pull sympathetic readers into his own mood of regret , not just for long-gone youth and foolishness , but for small-town , big-sky Western life as it was before shopping malls and industrial parks ate the best of it .
