A covert U.S. operation slowly spins out of control <P> The rumors are everywhere : a whisper in a caf here , a banner headline in a newspaper there . Throughout Nicaragua and Honduras , there is fearful talk of a war breaking out between the two neighbors . In Nicaragua , the Sandinista government has declared five provinces bordering Honduras " military emergency zones . " The regime is advising citizens to stockpile rice and other foods , while the papers in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua are filled with stories about alleged CIA plots . In Honduras , airfields are being built close to the border and soldiers gather in bars in the capital city of Tegucigalpa to talk strategy . The mood was perhaps best captured by a priest during Mass at the Church of St. Nicholas of Tolentino in Managua . " Please , God , " he intoned , " do not let an invasion happen . " <P> Nicaragua 's war jitters are being fueled by the country 's increasingly edgy , leftist Sandinista regime . Managua , however , has received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough as an effort to cut off the arms flowing through Nicaragua to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador , but that now appears to have grown into an attempt to topple the Sandinista government . As a result , the border between Honduras and Nicaragua has suddenly become a tinderbox where a few skirmishes could easily erupt into a full-scale shooting war . Even if war does not break out , critics contend , not only have the U.S. activities strengthened the resolve of the Sandinistas in Managua but the operations now threaten to destabilize Honduras itself . <P> Though the Sandinistas overthrew Dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle and seized control of Nicaragua in July 1979 , it was not until Ronald Reagan took office in January 1981 that relations between the two countries seriously deteriorated . The Administration began charging that the Sandinistas , backed by Cuba and the Soviet Union , were funneling arms to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador , often shipping the weapons across the southern heel of Honduras . In December 1981 , Reagan gave the go-ahead for a series of covert operations to snip the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for opposition groups within Nicaragua and military assistance to the various contras ( counterrevolutionaries ) who conduct raids into Nicaragua from bases in Honduras . For a " covert " operation , the U.S. effort was curiously , perhaps deliberately , open . News of Reagan 's decision began to leak out in Washington last March . In Honduras , the American agents were easily spotted because of their jeans , plaid shirts and short haircuts .
