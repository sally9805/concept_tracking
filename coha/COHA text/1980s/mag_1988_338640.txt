Before dawn , crowds of people waving red-and-yellow Vietnamese and Kampuchean flags assembled in the streets of Phnom Penh and along the boulevard leading to Pochentong airport . As marching music blared , senior Vietnamese officers , led by Lieut . General Le Ngoc Hien , drove past the Kampuchean throngs in Soviet-made jeeps , followed by buses carrying other officers and enlisted men .

In the early years of the occupation as many as 200,000 Vietnamese troops were in Kampuchea , but the number had fallen to 120,000 by the beginning of this year . This past spring Hanoi announced that it would withdraw its troops completely by 1990 , and last week 's ceremony marked the departure of the top commanders . In a striking statistical footnote , Vietnamese officials admitted last week that they had lost 50,000 soldiers in Kampuchea since the 1978 invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nam .
