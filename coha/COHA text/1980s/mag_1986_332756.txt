The greatest cycling duel in the 83-year history of the Tour de France ended last week on the Champs Elysees to the unprecedented strains of The Star- Spangled Banner . Greg LeMond , 25 , became the first non-European to win the premier race in this most passionately parochial of Old World sports . And the easygoing American did it by triumphing in a fratricidal war with his teammate  --  and friend  --  Bernard Hinault , 31 , who has become a two-wheeled French national monument . Over 2,542 miles , traversing 76 mountains and hills in the Pyrenees and Alps , covering as much as 160 miles a day in the flats , the two played out a drama of betrayal and reconciliation , and after more than 110 hours of racing in 23 days , just three minutes and ten seconds separated them . <P> They had nothing in common , really , except the sport . LeMond had grown up in affluence on the California beaches and the snowy slopes of the Sierra Nevada . At 14 , he took to cycling to build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not snow , and so an obsession was born . In the U.S. , cycling is what kids do after Santa Claus brings them a bike and before they get their driver 's license . Few of them are aware that the sport 's greatest heroes race in teams and can make as much as a star quarterback . A subtle , rolling chess game in which teammates devise strategies to wear out and hold back opponents , share the fatigue of breaking a head wind or control the pace to protect a team leader , cycling is built on intricacies as unknown to most Americans as particle physics . <P> When LeMond decided to become the world 's best , there was but one course to follow . Six years ago , with a new bride and his odd American dream of winning the Tour de France , he moved to Europe for the coaching and conditioning that were available only in the sport 's backyard . He did not underestimate the task : " It is as though a Frenchman moved to the United States at age 19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball . "
