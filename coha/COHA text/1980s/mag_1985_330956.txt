When Republican Roger Hedgecock vaulted to the office of mayor of San Diego in a special election in May 1983 , his future seemed all blue sky and candy . The former San Diego County supervisor had already earned a reputation as an innovative politician determined to help the community ward off urban sprawl , and as mayor he won approval for a new bay-front convention center and helped attract the 1988 Super Bowl to San Diego . So strong was the Hedgecock sentiment that last November voters awarded him a full four-year term as mayor , even though he had been indicted on conspiracy and perjury charges . His first trial ended in a hung jury last February . But last week a jury of eight women and four men pronounced the 39-year-old lawyer guilty of one count of conspiracy and twelve counts of perjury  --  convictions that , if upheld , would automatically expel him from office and bring him up to eight years in prison . Hedgecock resigned two days later . <P> The mayor admitted inexpressible " disappointment " and " anguish " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before reaching its verdict , largely because it found confronting the evidence a " painful experience , " as Juror Karen Dyer put it . In the end , the panel concluded that Hedgecock had 1 ) conspired to allow some $360,000 in illicit funds to be channeled into his 1983 campaign , and 2 ) lied over and over to cover up the scheme . The prosecutor , Deputy District Attorney Charles Wickersham , said that what clinched the verdict was a check for $3,000 made out to Hedgecock by one of three co-defendants , as well as proof that a second co-defendant had given him $130,000 to remodel his home . <P> The telltale check was written by onetime Currency Trader J. David Dominelli , who is serving a 20-year federal term for fraud and income tax evasion . Dominelli 's business partner and ex-girlfriend , Nancy Hoover , gave Hedgecock the money used on his house . Dominelli and Hoover are slated to be tried later , along with Political Consultant Tom Shepard , through whose firm hidden money passed to the Hedgecock campaign . Hedgecock 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new trial or , failing that , appeal the jury verdict . Hedgecock also faces legal action by California 's Fair Political Practices Commission , which is trying to assess him $975,000 in fines for an unprecedented 400 campaign-law violations . Even after last week 's verdict , Hedgecock was not without support . Said City Councilman Mike Gotch : " I think he 's been an excellent mayor . I 'm sorry that he has to go . "
