At commencement , prophets of doom , profits and Toyotas <P> For the past several weeks , to the sound of brass choirs and symphonic processionals , commencement speakers have taken their places behind campus daises across the country to offer such parting wisdom as they possessed . For the nation 's 1.3 million college graduates , the advice from their distinguished elders tended to be far more somber than lighthearted . The dominant topics were the nuclear arms race , the decline of Western values , the nation 's economic troubles and the dangerous tensions abroad . Polish Solidarity Leader Lech Walesa was awarded honorary degrees in absentia at Providence College in Rhode Island , Mac Murray College in Jacksonville , Ill. , and Springfield College in Massachusetts . Said Monsignor George G. Higgins at Providence College commencement ceremonies : " You Walesa are an electrician whose light can not be obscured by the darkness of despotism . You are a free man whose spirit can not be confined . " <P> A commencement sampler : Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau at the University of Notre Dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special role to play in this dangerously disturbed and divided world , a role based on power and the responsible use of power-superpower , to be more precise , and the super responsibilities that go with it . The burden that this places upon Americans is enormous , and it is not surprising that you have known moments of self-doubt and withdrawal . The health and vitality of our system and way of life are , ultimately , in your hands . " <P> <P> University of Notre Dame President the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh at Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia : " The nuclear threat is indeed the greatest moral problem of all times . For Theodore Hesburgh the years of the nuclear age , we humans have been painting ourselves into a corner . As Albert Einstein said , ' The splitting of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking , and thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe . ' Perhaps the worst attitude is to say that nothing can be done about it , that tensions between nations can not be relieved , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful in this world is to be doomed to utter extinction in our times , that we are indeed without hope . Do not believe it . Do not surrender hope . What one generation builds another can dismantle " <P> Political Cartoonist Garry Trudeau at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg , Va. : " It is no wonder that you 've given up on the culture . With no credible ego models , what 's left but to Garry Trudeau flock to your bookstores and buy handbooks on living preppies , dead cats , inert cubes , living cats and dead preppies-the subjects of the five bestselling titles on American campuses last year ? These are books for minds at rest . They are also the books favored by the rest of the nation , which suggests that the post-Viet Nam fatigue syndrome has us all in its grip . Your values and interests are no worse or better than those that are filtering down from the larger society that nurtured you . If you have not given your elders any clear sense of who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your elders . Your priorities do not turn out to be all that different from those of your parents .
