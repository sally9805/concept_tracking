New report reaffirms the link to heart disease <P> When the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences reported last spring that healthy adults should not be unduly worried about cholesterol in their diets , boosters of cholesterol-rich foods were gleeful . At last the stigma attached to beef , eggs and junk fare seemed to be lifting . But last week cholesterol 's reputation as a major factor in heart disease was buttressed with the publication of a 20-year epidemiological survey of middle-aged American men . <P> The study , conducted by scientists at Chicago 's Rush-Presbyterian-St . Luke 's Medical Center and at Harvard , Northwestern and the University of Michigan , involved 1,900 men recruited in 1957 from Western Electric Co. ' s Hawthorne Works plant near Chicago . Then aged 40 to 55. the subjects were questioned in detail about their diets and personal habits . Using a checklist of 195 foods , researchers determined what and how much the men had eaten in the preceding 28 days . The participants ' wives and employees at the company cafeteria were asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , middle or high according to his intake of cholesterol , saturated fat ( found in red meats and dairy products ) and polyunsaturated fat ( vegetable oils ) . <P> Twenty years later , the scientists tracked down the participants . The main finding : those who had consumed large amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat suffered upwards of a third more deaths from heart disease than those who consumed relatively small amounts . Says Epidemiologist Richard Shekelle of Rush-Presbyterian-St . Luke 's , author of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine : " If you look at the weight of the evidence over the years , then our study reinforces the conclusion that dietary cholesterol affects the level of cholesterol in the blood and increases the risk of heart disease . " <P> Nevertheless , the report is unlikely to halt debate over cholesterol . Critics of the diet-heart link point out that the body manufactures most of the cholesterol found in the blood . Thus even the most careful diet will have only a limited effect on cholesterol levels . The Chicago survey also failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could have affected the development of heart disease . Notes Peyton Davis of the National Live Stock and Meat Board : " Not only diet could change , but also the amount of alcohol a man consumes , the amount he smokes and how much exercise he gets . " <P> <P> Shekelle acknowledges that it " would be reasonable to assume " that many Hawthorne Works employees did change their diets . " Americans as a whole have reduced the amount of cholesterol they take in , " he says . " But I would say our study probably underestimates the effect of diet . Most of our subjects were ' meat and potatoes ' men . Practically no one had what could be called a low-fat diet . " <P> His recommendation : " The ' prudent diet ' should be followed by people who are concerned about heart disease . That means decreasing the amount of fats and cholesterol . "
