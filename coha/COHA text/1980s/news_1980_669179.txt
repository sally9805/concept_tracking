It is the only vessel in a massive tidal basin here at the Simonstown base of the South African Navy . The base , a multimillion-dollar facility opened earlier this year , could accommodate up to 50 ships. // But the base was planned in a different era , when South Africa was politically closer to Western nations . Then , the crews of many a visiting man-of-war found that nearby Cape Town fully lived up to its sobriquet  --  " the Tavern of the Seas. " // Today , however , due to this country ' s internal racial policies , South Africa is a pariah among nations . Military vessels from the West steam right past South Africa : No american naval ship has called here in more than a decade . And what is arguably one of the best military port facilities in Africa stands underutilized. // Underutilized , perhaps , but not unnoticed . A Western world tenuously tethered to the oil fields of the Gulf has become newly sensitized to the need to protect its floating oil lifeline . Events like the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that. // And as the United States steps up efforts to protect oil shipments , increasing attention is being focused on South Africa  --  a country that sits astride the junction of the indian and South Atlantic Oceans. // Assessment of South Africa ' s maritime importance is no easy task . By some calculations , fully 90 percent of the oil from the Gulf is shipped around the Cape Agulhas , at Africa ' s southern tip  --  including 60 percent of America ' s oil imports and 80 percent of Western Europe ' s. // For several years , the South African government has been ballyhooing the importance of the Cape sea route in an effort to draw Western nations closer . And opponents of the white minority government here have just as strenuously belittled the Cape ' s strategic importance in an effort to isolate South Africa further. // The issue has become so politicized , says Deon Fourie , a lecturer in strategic studies at the University of South Africa , that " it ' s never been analyzed objectively. " // Is the Cape passage " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Rep. Melvin Price ( D ) of Illinois , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee says ? // " There is no Cape sea route , " Mr. Woods writes . " There is a vast ocean between South Africa and Antarctica , and to call that a sea route is like calling the Atlantic Ocean a sea route. " // A more accurate view , however , may be somewhere in between these extremes. // Dr. Michael Hough , director of the Institute for Strategic Studies at the University of Pretoria , concedes , " There are about 6 , 000 nautical miles of water between Cape Point and the ice of Antartica "  --  theoretically giving a hostile power wide berth to interdict shipping without ever coming close to South Africa. // But other analysts point out that the icy stretches below latitude 40 degrees south are so hostile  --  mariners have dubbed them the " roaring 40s "  --  that is unlikely that oil tankers or attack vessels would venture that far . Consequently , ship traffic is funnelled to within 500 nautical miles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cape passage may largely miss the point. // Some analyst argue that there are a number of other " choke points " along the oil supply routes to the West . And , they add , there is little reason to believe a hostile power would choose the Cape over any other locale to disrupt oil tanker traffic. // " I see the whole oil route as very important , " says John Barratt , director of the South African institute of International Affairs. // " But the most important place , " he adds , " is the Gulf , where the oil comes out of the ground , and the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf. // " I have not been able to see where the Cape is more important than the coast of Kenya , or the straits between Madagascar and the African continent. " // Moreover , experts argue , any interference with Western oil shipments , no matter where it takes place , would be taken as an act of aggression that probably would lead to Western retaliation. // " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other part of the world , " says Mr. Barratt . Given this view , South Africa becomes neither more nor less important than any other country on the Indian Ocean littoral when it comes to policing the oil shipping lanes. // " The route is a long one , " says Mr. Barratt. " there could be sinking anywhere along it. " // Therefore , he continues , South Africa ' s maritime importance may not concern " so much the Cape sea route as the communications and port facilities " on shore. using South Africa as a base would allow Western ships to maintain a presence in vast stretches of the Indian Ocean , not just around the Cape. // Mr. Fourie goes further , arguing that possible future Soviet moves to disrupt oil shipments are a far less important strategic issue than " what the Soviets can do now. " // Since 1968 , the Soviet naval presence in the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans has been growing steadily . In Africa , the Soviets have been accused of using their Navy to support military action in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( when that country arrested captains of Soviet fishing trawlers operating illegally in Ghanaian waters ) , and to attempt to influence elections in Sierra Leone. // " The Soviets have made themselves very obvious , " says Mr. Fourie , adding that " some sort of military linkup in the Indian Ocean is needed to neutralize the political influence of the Soviet Navy. " // And the South African naval base at Simonstown theoretically would provide a key coupling in any such linkup . Indeed , some planners hold that Simonstown offers the finest docking and maintenance facilities between Singapore and the Strait of Gibraltar. // Simonstown can handle most Western military vessels ( with the exception of the largest nuclear aircarft carriers ) . Its work force of 2 , 700 is capable of refitting nine ships yearly , says Simonstown production manager Capt . C. J. Lautenbach , and that capability could be increased without undue difficulty . But , he adds , South Africa would probably need certain advanced maintenance equipment if American ships began calling at Simonstown. // Mr. Barratt notes that South Africa ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power  --  the Soviet Union  --  takes an interest in the region. " // And a South African naval spokesman , Capt . Edmund Palmer , says there is rising Soviet interest in southern Africa . South Africa is expecting assignment of more Soviet maritime advisers to friendly governments in the subcontinent , he says . Moreover , he cites unconfirmed reports that Coetivy Island , off the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean , is being converted into Soviet base facilities and that the Soviets are seeking base rights in Mauritius. // Even if the Soviets do not gain these base rights , says Captain Palmer , Simonstown could still prove attractive to US ships  --  if for no other reason than to allow " R and R " ( rest and recuperation ) in nearby Cape Town . Mombasa , Kenya , is now the only place on the East African coast where American crews can take shore leave . And the recent killing of a Kenyan woman by a visiting US seaman , which provoked a strong public outcry , has underscored the delicacy of that arrangement. // As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Palmer predicts " morale problems " due to long stretches on board ship . But , he says , Cape Town  --  undeniably one of the world ' s most stunningly situated cities  --  offers plenty of diversions. // Other observers , however , wonder whether Us sailors  --  many of whom are black  --  could enjoy themselves in a racially segregated city. although Cape Town is perhaps the most liberal-minded of South Africa ' s cities , it still puts many restrictions on its nonwhite residents. // Of course , US military use of South African ports remains very much in the realm of speculation . The last Us naval vessel , the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt , visited Simonstown in 1969 . Even then , angry Washington officials banned all shore leave for the crew after black sailors were harassed by South African whites. // Also , there would have to be a sea change in American attitudes if South Africa ' s Navy was to play a significant role in an Indian Ocean or South Atlantic alliance . In years past , the South African Navy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing protection for convoys rounding the Cape. // But , since the 1977 arms embargo , South Africa has been forced to concentrate its aging fleet on shore protection duty . Its thre frigates are of 1960s vintage , and its three Daphne-calss submarines ( supplied by France before the embargo ) are small and have only limited capability . Eight coastal mine sweepers , six missile-equipped " strike craft , " and five large patrol craft round out its Navy , according to Jane ' s Fighting Ships 1979-80 . But the Navy remains " purely a defensive force " says one well-informed observer here. // It is problematical whether the West could aid in beefing up South Africa ' s fleet without running afoul of the arms embargo . Some observers suggest that the West could provide maritime surveillance aircraft  --  to bolster South Africa ' s declining antisubmarine warfare capability  --  without causing too much political uproar. // But there argue that any military cooperation with South Africa is bound to provoke a hostile reaction from balck Africa  --  notably from Nigeria , the No. 2 exporter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the two governments should be able to " work out some gradations of aid " that are aimed at countering Soviet influence rather than propping up white minority rule in South Africa. // One possible model : a pact giving the US base rights in Somalia , a country widely viewed as an aggressor by its African neighbors . The arrangament , negotiated earlier this year , sparked both domestic and international controversy . But the United States administration was able to convince some critics that it would not become involved in Somali military adventurism or get dragged into Somalia ' s conflicts with neighboring states. // " There ' s quite a lot that can be done " to foster similar cooperation between the US and South Africa , says Mr. Fourie , " if American politicians see this as politically safe. " // But there are other , behind-the-scenes ways that the West and South Africa could pursue their joint military interest . One is through cooperation in intelligence-gathering. // The sophisticated South African communications and surveillance center at Silvermine , for example , is apparently capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic arc from South America to the Indian Ocean , stretching southward to Antartica . The South African government claims the center can chart the movements of " every ship sailing the Southern Hemisphere , " besides determining the nationality , type , and armament of each one. // Monitor correspondent Stephen Webbe reports from the Pentagon that it is likely that intelligence on Soviet naval movements in the Cape region already is being passed between Pretoria and Washington . Indeed , he adds , the Cape would be a logical location for the Sonar Surveillance System , which is part of the US Navy ' s intelligence-gathering effort to keep tabs on Soviet submarines. // Some South African politicians have been exculting about the possibility of a " new relatiopnship " with the WEst after the victory of Ronald Reagan in the American presidential election . But many South African analysts are under no illusions about the extent of possible military collaboration between the two governments  --  unless major changes are made in South Africa ' s racial policies. // South Africans should " certainly not " harbor " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mr. Fourie. // " It would be unrealistic , " concludes Mr. Barratt , " for anyone to assume that the American government can give outright support to this South African government. " // " That , " he says , " is just not on. " // Next : Limiting Soviet influence in southern Africa// //
