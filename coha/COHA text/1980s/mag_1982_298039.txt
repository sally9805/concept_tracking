In the Arab world , there is a widespread belief that if a child is too beautiful or brilliant , he may attract the evil eye . Parents were once known to disfigure especially pretty babies in order to protect them . God should have arranged some such mild , pre-emptive mutilation for Lebanon . He did not , however . <P> Lebanon was always as sweet and cunning and ancient and beautiful as the world . It was literate , rich , fabulous , chic as Atlantis in better days . No land was ever luckier , more cosmopolitan . If you drove in from the east , out of the deserts of Jordan , Iraq or Syria , Lebanon was the coolest , greenest , richest land in the imagination of Allah . You climbed the Lebanon Mountains , and suddenly beheld the Mediterranean . Its deep blue waters played in the eye against the snow on the tops of the mountains . The air was dense with the scent of thyme and cedar . <P> It was a profoundly favored place . No oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain desert peoples . But Lebanon had beauty and protective fastnesses in its mountains . Shrewd and unusual people found refuge there , sects like the Maronite Christians and the Druzes . Lebanon was never really a nation in the ordinary sense , but a sort of charmed collection of tribes . Its pace in the old days was a delight . TIME Correspondent Wilton Wynn , who has written about Lebanon since 1946 , remembers the hospitality of the countryside , the farmers in their fruit groves forcing a stranger to accept gifts of grapes and white figs and apples and pears . He remembers the magnificent village breakfasts of arak , kebab , grilled liver , tomatoes , yogurt , onions , eggs fried in pottery pans and flavored with sumac . <P> The merchant genius of the Phoenicians seemed to linger over the land that Lebanon inherited from them . Beirut , a bright , amiable amalgam of beach resort and international bank and world-class shopping mall and neon whorehouse , was invariably called the Paris of the Middle East . It may have been more like Monte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanese were cultured and vividly commercial . They stood precisely at the intersection of Western and Middle Eastern culture , and took a handsome profit by mediating between the two . They have the highest literacy rate and the only real parliamentary democracy in the Arab world . <P> Desert sheiks banked their oil wealth there , took their pleasures there . Money poured in . Multinational companies installed their regional headquarters . Lebanese lawyers would know more about Iraqi law than Iraqi lawyers , or more about Saudi law than Saudis . The Lebanese were cheerfully prepared to do anything for a price .
