txt THE DILEMMA of " Buy American " and pay more , or save money by buying abroad , fell into the laps of the commissioners of the Metropolitan Sanitary District lact WOPk and the , ' did n't likr it nor hit The problem surfaced when Hugh H. , the district 's general superintendent , asked the board to approve a $275,911 increase in a contract with Robert W. Hunt Co. of Chicago from $462,168 to $738,079 . The Hunt Co. has been retained by the MSD to inspect all equipment to he installed in the MSD 's main pumping station for its Deep Tunnel pollution-control project . It is being constructed in suburban Hodgkins by the Kiewit-Shea-Kenny combine for $168 million . explained that the combine is buying the pumps , motors , and flow-control gates for the station in Japan .

He said it will cost Hunt $270 a day more for the inspectors over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . EXPLAINED to the commissioners that , under the terms of the contract , the MSD would be reimbursed for the overseas inspection work by the combine . But that did n't seem to mollify the board . " Here we are , buying large quantities of equipment from Japan , while many of our own people are out of work , " complained Commissioner Chester P. Majewski . " Ca n't we buy some of these parts in the United States ? " " I just returned from a trip to Europe , " joined in Commissioner James C. Kirie , " and everywhere it is the same : the market for American products is drying up and all you see is German and Japanese products . " explained that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , which must approve federally funded projects such as Deep Tunnel , allows domestic manufacturers a 61/2 per cent advantage . " If the American companies bid even that much higher than the foreign companies , the Kiewit-SheaKenny people still could accept the American bids , " said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE meeting , Frank E. Dalton , the district 's deputy chief engineer , who is in charge of the Deep Tunnel project , said that the Japanese bids were 44 pr cent lower than the American bids . " Our engineers had figured the'equipment would cost $7,500,000 , The American bids came in at $11,457,000 . The Japanese bids came in at $6,599,000 . That 's a 44 per cent difference , " Dalton said . Commissioner Nellie L. Jones asked that the Hunt matter be deferred two weeks . Commissioner Thomas S. Fuller asked the board to consider a " Buy American " resolution , and Commissionr William A. Jaskula seconded it . " All that is n't going to change the fact that the Japanese firms are going to get the work and the Hunt people are going to have to go over there and do their inspecting there , " Forrest C. Neil , the district 's chief engineer , reminded the board .
