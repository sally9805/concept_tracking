After two years of controversy over who would be allowed to attend , an impressive new South Loop elementary school opens its doors Monday . Though they are enthusiastic about the $5. 5 million school with its special arts and science facilities , the parents who fought for an elementary school in the burgeoning Dearborn Park and Printers Row neighborhoods remain guarded about the school ' s future under an enrollment plan approved by the Board of Education . The parents joined teachers and administrators Sunday afternoon at South Loop Elementary School , 1212 S. Plymouth Ct. , putting books on shelves , unpacking instructional materials and making sure all the blackboards have chalk . " It took two years of pressure ; we came to see what we won , " said Catrina Brown , of 2001 S. Michigan Ave. , as she unpacked some of the art supplies her 5-year-old daughter will be using . " We ' re satisfied . " Dearborn Park parents fought for the school saying that it had been promised when redevelopment changed the neighborhood south of the Loop . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Hilliard Homes , 2030 S. State St. , complained to the board that they had been waiting for a new school for more than 20 years-much longer than their middle-class neighbors to the north . After months of debate and revisions , the school board approved a plan that , for now , allows children from both areas to go to the school . The board set the enrollment limit at 540 students , specifying that rooms for sciences and special fine-arts programs not be converted into classrooms and that class sizes remain at about 30 . Judy Hoch , leader of Friends of Dearborn Park School , a parents group , said she is satisfied with the final plan that will allow the school to open . " Our kids get first preference no matter what , and as long as integration is maintained and there is no overcrowding , we ' re satisfied , " Hoch said . Teachers were supposed to set up last week , but Hoch said paper work was not completed . In order to ensure that all was ready for Monday , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $285 to rent the school for a day so teachers could set up their materials Sunday . Only 338 children will attend South Loop when it opens Monday , because the school will have classes only for students in kindergarten through 6th grade this year . It will add 7th-grade classes next school year and 8th grade the following year . Under the attendance plan , students within the school ' s neighborhood boundaries-the Chicago River on the north and west , Lake Michigan on the east and Cermak Road on the south-get first preference . Hilliard Homes children will go to the Haines Elementary School branch at 1915 S. Federal St. , from kindergarten through the 2d grade , but then can transfer to South Loop . Hilliard parents say their children will enter the school at a disadvantage because the pupils will spend the first three years at what the parents say is an inferior school . " We don ' t think we can be sure to get the same education until we go to the same school from kindergarten through 8th grade , " said Jacqueline Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement council when the plan to keep Hilliard students at the branch school until 3d grade was first announced . The current enrollment plan also allows children from the overcrowded Pilsen-area schools to attend the school on a lottery basis if space is available . And because the school has magnet fine-arts programs , students can apply from all over the city for any extra classroom slots . The students attending classes Monday will include about 86 children from Hilliard Homes ; about 70 from the Dearborn Park area who now attend as many as three other schools ; about 45 from two middle-income high-rises at 20th Street and Michigan Avenue ; and 137 other students , including 15 Hispanics , from around the city . Enrollment may push against the 540-student limit once the students now in kindergarten , 1st and 2d grade at the branch school enter the South Loop school at the 3d-grade level . In order to meet the school board ' s goals to maintain a racial mix of 30 percent white and 70 percent minority in the future , the school will need more classrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal . " The question is what will happen down the road when we reach our critical capacity , " Fron said . She said she thinks enrollment will not be a problem this year or next year . Everyone involved agrees that if , as planned , more residential buildings are developed in the South Loop area , another elementary school will be required . But , for now , teachers and parents are excited about the new school . It was designed as a fine-arts school and receives additional funding for its magnet fine-arts program . It has a large dance studio with mirrored walls , dance barre and dressing rooms ; a small theater-in-the-round , complete with stage lighting ; specialized music rooms with acoustical padding for the walls ; and an arts lab complete with pottery kiln . The physical plant is not the only difference in this school . Its teachers were handpicked by the principal after each was interviewed by a panel of parents . " We asked them how they would feel about going into Hilliard Homes if they had to go there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also of 2001 S. Michigan Ave . " We asked them what they would do if they were faced with a racial conflict between the children . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Bill Hogan .
