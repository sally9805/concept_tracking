A 23-year-old stockbroker for Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith Inc. was arrested Friday on mail fraud charges relating to the possible misappropriation of nearly $47 million from the firm ' s Boca Raton , Fla. , office . The FBI said it arrested the broker , Leslie Howard Roberts , after an audit late Thursday by Merrill Lynch and the Florida comptroller ' s office disclosed a " discrepancy " of about $47 million in one of his customer ' s accounts . The customer was identified by an investigator for the comptroller ' s office as Roberts ' great uncle , Frank Gory of Hallendale , Fla . Gory received statements showing there was $55 million in his accounts , but the audit of Merrill Lynch records indicated the actual value was $8. 2 million , state officials said . Roberts , a former E.F. Hutton &; Co. broker who had been working for Merrill Lynch for only 11 weeks , was charged with sending false confirmation slips to Gory . The slips indicated that there had been trades in Gory ' s accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the FBI said . Circuit Court Judge Daniel Hurley of West Palm Beach on Friday issued an order freezing the assets of Roberts and three other Merrill Lynch employees and preventing the destruction of any records . The three , who worked as Roberts ' sales assistants , are his half- brothers , Michael Steven Roberts , 24 , and Jeffrey Lee Roberts , no age given , and Sandra Piligian , 24 . They were not charged with any wrongdoing . Roberts was being held in Palm Beach County Jail pending a hearing Tuesday before a U.S. magistrate . A spokesman for Merrill Lynch in New York said Roberts and the sales assistants were dismissed Thursday . He said that the $47 million discrepancy didn ' t reflect a misappropriation of funds . " There has been no misappropriation of funds at Merrill Lynch , " the spokesman said . " Rather , the allegations concern misrepresentation of the profitability of the accounts . " But Larry Fuchs , Florida deputy comptroller , said it isn ' t yet clear whether or not the funds were stolen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss or the extent of the loss , " said Fuchs . " The $47 million discrepancy could be a misrepresentation of profits or a loss or a combination of the two . " Neither Gory nor his attorneys could be reached for comment . Merrill Lynch and Hutton said they are cooperating with authorities in the investigation . According to an affidavit filed in Circuit Court by Steven Horn , an investigator for the Florida comptroller ' s office , Roberts had been the " No. 1 broker in the world " at Hutton , where he worked for a year before moving to Merrill Lynch in late November . To change jobs , Roberts demanded that his half-brothers and Piligian also be hired , the affidavit stated . Roberts generated commissions of more than $200 , 000 a month in his first two months at Merrill Lynch , Horn said . The broker also claimed to be extremely wealthy , according to the affidavit , with an income of $2 million in the last year , a $1. 5 million house , private jet and expensive jewelry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a Lamborghini , a Lotus and a Porsche 928 , the affidavit stated . Horn said in the affidavit that Roberts introduced himself as the grandson of Gory ' s sister and attracted Gory ' s business while he was at Hutton . Gory told Merrill Lynch officials about the discrepancy in his accounts after being alerted to the problem by his son , who filled Roberts ' job at Hutton after Roberts moved to Merrill Lynch , according to the affidavit . Investigators found that Gory ' s actual account statements and trade confirmations , mailed from New York and Ft . Lauderdale , were sent to a fictitious address in Hialeah , Fla . , Horn said in the affidavit . Meanwhile , " bogus " documents were mailed to Gory from Boca Raton , Horn said . According to the affidavit , Merrill Lynch informed Florida authorities of the alleged fraud Thursday evening . Officials of the brokerage firm , comptroller ' s office and FBI conducted an audit in Merrill Lynch ' s office through the night and arrested Roberts at his Boca Raton home at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " bogus " documents were found in the desk of Michael Steven Roberts , investigators concluded that all four individuals were involved in the scheme , according to the affidavit.
