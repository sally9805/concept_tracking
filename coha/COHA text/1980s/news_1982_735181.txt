txt Some of the nation 's major airlines will raise fares on domestic routes this week by as much as $10 a ticket . Spokesmen for United Airlines , American Airlines . Eastern Airlines and Delta Airlines said they plan fare increases that take effect Thursday at the latest . Officials of other airlines could n't be reached for comment , but many are expected to follow suit . The fare increases wo n't affect the hotly competitive , discounted routes between Florida and the Northeast and Florida and the Midwest , nor will they affect most transcontinental fares . But airline officials say the increases are intended to reverse a pattern of industry price wars , which on Florida and other routes have slashed airline revenue . - We 've had a couple of rounds of pretty sharp fare-cutting , " said a spokesman for Eastern in Miami . " It 's been one of the worst years for the entire industry . " In general , rates will rise on most socalled " feeder routes , " or those that connect small or medium-sized cities with major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neb. , to Chicago would be a typical feeder route . Industry officials say jet fuel costs have risen 16% since May of 1980 , while labor and parts costs also have risen . " Something had to give . " said a Delta spokesman . " and when one moves , the rest can go along . " As previously reported , United , a unit of UAL Inc. , decided on a 810 increase on most fares in November . American said it followed United 's lead . A spokesman said American would raise fares Thursday " on all routes except where we have a competitor who does n't raise fares . " In recent weeks Delta has led the pricecutting on Florida routes , but yesterday its spokesman said that fares on many other Delta routes would rise . Eastern , which has " a huge overlap " ? with Delta , will follow suit . " Tomorrow we 'll have to analyze which fares Delta is raising , and we 'll do whatever they do , " the Eastern official said . He said he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all happened New Year 's Eve  --  that 's when we got word that Delta would raise fares . "
