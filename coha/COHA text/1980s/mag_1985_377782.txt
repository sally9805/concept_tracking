To a whole generation of Americans , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the most accessible of figures . Millions felt intimately familiar with all the details of his life : his wife Eleanor , his Scottish Terrier Fala , his cigarette holder , his stamp collection . Yet F.D.R. 's Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr . described him as simultaneously evasive and frank , frivolous as well as grave , " a man of bewildering complexity . " The playwright Robert Sherwood , who served for years as the President 's speechwriter , admitted that he had never been able to penetrate Roosevelt 's " heavily forested interior . " <P> Geoffrey Ward , former editor of American Heritage , is the latest of many to explore those thickets . He does so by returning to F.D.R. 's origins . The Roosevelts , it turns out , were a strange and sometimes bizarre family , and their history illuminates many of F.D.R. 's foibles . The future President 's father James was widower of 52 when he suddenly proposed marriage to the equally lofty Sara Delano , age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sara 's father was one of those 19th century entrepreneurs who had made a fortune smuggling Turkish opium into China . <P> Sara Delano Roosevelt was in labor more than 24 hours before her 10-lb. son Franklin was born , blue and breathless . The doctor urged that she avoid further pregnancies , which she may have done by totally abstaining from sex . Her dedication to young Franklin was of an intensity bordering on the morbid . She kept him in girlish skirts and long blond curls until he was nearly six . Every hour of his day followed a strict schedule : up at 7 , breakfast at 8 , lessons from 9 to noon . <P> When the boy was eight , a temporary depression aroused his mother 's anxieties . " A little alarmed , " she later recalled , " I asked him whether he was unhappy . He ... said very seriously , ' Yes , I am unhappy . ' When I asked him why , he ... exclaimed , ' Oh , for freedom ! ' " <P> Ward soberly records these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the explosion that never comes . F.D.R. turns into a complaisant youth , somewhat spoiled but eager to please . Schooling at Groton does not greatly change him , and neither does Harvard . When he is Assistant Secretary of the Navy , he claims that his failure to get into Harvard 's Porcellian Club 15 years earlier was " the greatest disappointment of my life . " <P> He proposes to his cousin Eleanor , who comes from an even weirder branch of the family . Her father Elliott , younger brother of President Theodore Roosevelt , was afflicted by alcoholism and drug addiction . Her mother 's brother , Vallie Hall , liked to get drunk and fire his shotgun out the window . <P> Ward writes smoothly and pleasantly about all these eccentrics . Even so , his young hero remains a remote , undeveloped figure . It might be argued that anyone who thought his failure to make the Porcellian Club was the greatest disappointment of his life had not led a very interesting life . The fact is that at the time of Roosevelt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet become F.D.R. It was only his later struggle with polio that added the necessary steel to his character . Ward is already at work on sequel . It can not fail to reveal a stranger , stronger character , but it will build on this odd foundation .  --  By Otto Friedrich
