Corporal Danny Fudge of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stopped for coffee in a Yukon fishing village one day last summer and proceeded to make the catch of his life . In the Yukon Motel restaurant in Teslin ( pop . 350 ) , the ruddy , barrel-chested Mountie eyed a 300-lb. stranger sitting nearby . He thought he might have seen the man before  --  on a wanted poster . The stranger , it turned out , was Charles McVey , a particularly notorious smuggler sought by U.S. Customs officials for illegally exporting millions of dollars ' worth of computer equipment to Moscow . The sharp-eyed Corporal Fudge got his man , and is now a decorated hero . McVey sits in a Vancouver jail awaiting extradition proceedings next month . <P> For years , savvy smugglers , complicit businessmen and well-heeled Soviet officials managed to stay out of sight as they ferried America 's technological secrets from West to East . No longer . A string of scandals , beginning with last spring 's Toshiba affair , has pushed the issue of high-tech banditry squarely into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happy ending supplied by Corporal Fudge , have strengthened the resolve of U.S. officials to track down and punish those who traffic in the nation 's secrets . Earlier this month Commerce Secretary William Verity announced that officials from the NATO allies and Japan will meet early next year to discuss different ways to stop sensitive technology from reaching the Soviet Union . <P> By working together , Western officials hope to fortify an export-control system that is clearly overloaded , underfunded and outdated . Since World War II , Western countries have jointly agreed on which products should be restricted through the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls ( COCOM ) . But as new items proliferate , regulatory agencies face what one observer calls a " world of grays , " a mass of technical detail required for every licensing decision . Officials are finding it harder to monitor thousands of proscribed exports , as the line between military and civilian products becomes blurred and the potential uses of new products keep changing . <P> Businessmen are frustrated by the complex regulations that seem to do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy of Sciences estimates that U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports cost American firms more than $11 billion annually in lost business . As the U.S. works to reduce its trade deficit and recapture overseas markets , those restrictions amount to a self-imposed trade barrier the U.S. can scarcely afford . Furthermore , maintains Harvard 's Lewis Branscomb , former chief scientist at IBM , the scope of restricted items , from straitjackets to wind tunnels , is unnecessarily broad . " It would be nice to ensure that the Russians did n't learn anything important , " he says , " but there 's just no way to do that . "
