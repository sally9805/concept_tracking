Living longer and better <P> Births and marriages are up . Deaths and divorces are down . Life expectancy is higher than ever . That was the cheery news last week from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) in its annual report on U.S. population trends . <P> Life expectancy in 1982 , according to the study 's provisional figures , rose to an estimated 74.5 years for the total population , up from 70.8 in 1970 . Each race and sex group also registered record highs , although the life expectancy of blacks still lagged behind that of the rest of the population . White females born in 1982 could expect to live 78.7 years , longer than any other group ; black females had a life expectancy of 73.8 years . White males followed with 71.4 years ; black males trailed with 64.8 years . <P> There were 1.7 million more births than deaths in 1982 , what demographers call " a natural increase . " The U.S. recorded the largest number of births ( 3.7 million ) since 1970 and the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deaths ( 2 million ) dropped slightly below the 1981 level , possibly because there were no serious influenza outbreaks in 1982 . The 1982 infant mortality rate ( 11.2 per 1,000 live births ) was the lowest ever recorded in the nation . Infants are doing better , says NCHS Demographer Kate Prager , because of the " improvement in medical technology in caring for sick newborns . " <P> Heart disease continues to decline but still tops the list of the 15 leading killers , a group that causes 89% of all American deaths . Cancer , at No. 2 , is on the upswing as a cause of death . Fatalities from cerebrovascular disease , accidents , motor-vehicle collisions and chronic pulmonary disease are falling . Suicide leaped up the list from No. 10 to No. 8 , principally because two ailments once ahead of it , chronic liver disease and atherosclerosis , continued to drop . <P> Divorce American-style became decidedly less popular than marriage in 1982 . The number of divorces ( 1.2 million ) declined by 3% , the first decrease since 1962 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 4% drop from 1981 . The divorce rate last year ranged from a low 3.2 per 1,000 in Pennsylvania to a high 13.9 per 1,000 in Nevada and 8.3 in Alaska . Marriages ( 2.5 million ) boomed for the seventh straight year and reached the highest rate ( 10.8 per 1,000 ) since 1973 . The sharpest rises , 5% and 6% respectively , occurred in the Middle Atlantic states and New England . The dip in the divorce rate may be partly the result of a new trend revealed in another Government study : the postponement of marriage by those in the 20-to-24 age group . " There is a lot of evidence , " says NCHS Demographer Barbara Wilson , " that early marriages are less stable . "
