After two postponements in three days because of bad weather and a computer failure , the Discovery barely got off the ground before the darkening clouds moved over the launching pad and the rain descended in torrents . Trouble then seemed to follow the five astronauts into space. // A malfunction encountered two hours into the flight forced the astronauts to deploy one of the three satellites in the cargo bay a day early . This was Aussat 1 , Australia ' s first communications satellite , which was successfully released into orbit at 1 : 33 P.M. Eastern daylight time. // When the astronauts were inspecting the cargo by remotely controlled cameras , a shield that was to protect Aussat 1 from direct exposure to sunlight stuck in a partly open position . An astronaut used the shuttle ' s mechanical arm to nudge the sunshade completely open so the spring-loaded satellite could be released . Any delay of more than six hours could have resulted in radiation damage to the exposed satellite ' s electronics . <> <> Second Satellite Deployed // Later , the astronauts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Satellite Company . This was the only satellite originally scheduled to leave the cargo bay on the first day of what is the nation ' s 20th flight of a space shuttle. // Both the Australian and American communications satellites were reported tonight to be climbing toward their intended orbits 22 , 300 miles above the Equator . Rockets on each of them , fired after deployment from the shuttle at an altitude of 218 miles , provided the power to reach the higher orbit. // A third satellite , Leasat 4 , is to be deployed Thursday morning , as planned . Owned by the Hughes Aircraft Company and leased to the Navy , the satellite will be part of a worldwide military communications network. // With those tasks behind them , the astronauts plan to steer the Discovery to a rendezvous with Leasat 3 , a similar satellite that failed after it was deployed by a shuttle last April . A timing mechanism apparently malfunctioned , preventing the rocket firing that should have boosted the satellite to its operational orbit. // On Sunday , or perhaps as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. van Hoften and Dr. William F. Fisher , are to leave the Discovery cabin for a space walk in which they will try to rewire the crippled satellite to bypass the defective timing device . If the repair is successful , ground controllers expect to be able to activate the satellite and fire its rocket . <> <> Mission Could Be Shortened // The mission , which had been scheduled to last eight days , may now be shortened , space agency officials said , because of the early release of the Australian satellite and the possibility of performing the repairs a day or two earlier . The landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California could come as early as next Monday. // Commanding the flight is Col. Joe H. Engle , who turned 53 years old Monday while he was waiting out the launching postponements . Storm clouds charged with lightning caused the first delay on Saturday . And a computer on the Discovery failed in the final minutes of the countdown Sunday , putting off the launching until today. // With Colonel Engle , an Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are Lieut . Col. Richard O. Covey of the Air Force and John M. Lounge as well as Dr. van Hoften and Dr. Fisher . Dr. van Hoften is the only other crew member with space flight experience. // Liftoff for them finally came at 6 : 58 A.M. , the official time of sunrise . But there was no sun in sight . In the night a tropical disturbance brought heavy rains , as forecast , and remained as a threat through the final hours and minutes of the countdown . Clouds darkened the sky just about everywhere . A steady drizzle fell at the press site three miles from the launching pad and on parts of the runway where the shuttle might have to land in an emergency. // " We had been struggling with the weather all night long , " Robert Sieck , the launching director , recalled afterward . " We pressed on . It was obviously marginal , but it was acceptable . " <> <> Small Patch of Dry Weather // At a news conference here , Mr. Sieck said the reports from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small patch of dry weather directly over the launching pad and over the north end of the landing runway . Mr. Sieck , an engineer who served as a meteorologist when he was in the Air Force , decided there might be just enough clearing and time to go for the launching. // Although the skies seemed darker than at the time of Saturday ' s postponement , Mr. Sieck said the clouds today held no threat of lightning , which had been the main cause of concern Saturday . Mission rules dictate that no launching should take place if there is a chance of lightning striking the shuttle or of rain in the clouds through which the shuttle must ascend . As the shuttle gains altitude and speed , raindrops become bullets to the craft ' s fragile heat-shielding tiles. // " We did not force any of those limits in this decision , " Mr. Sieck said. // As it turned out , the liftoff was delayed only three minutes - and that was not because of the weather . A freighter had strayed into restricted offshore waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way. // If the delay had been much longer , though , there could have been no launching for another day . For after liftoff came the deluge. // Shortly after 9 A.M. , the astronauts reported that the sunshield appeared to be snagged on the antenna of the Aussat 1 satellite , which was stowed in the forward end of the 60-foot-long cargo bay . It could not be closed to shade the satellite or opened to clear the way for deployment . <> <> Switch to Back-Up System // At about the same time , the astronauts also got a warning of trouble with the control electronics in the elbow joint of the mechanical arm . They switched to a back-up system , which performed normally . The mechanical arm is to be used in hauling the Leasat 3 in for repairs. // Flight controllers did not think the two malfunctions were related , though the television camera attached to the elbow joint may have struck the sunshield as it was being opened . The arm was stowed along the port side of the cargo bay , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five inches clearance between the elbow camera and the satellite. // If the camera was cocked slightly out of position , shuttle officials said , this could have accounted for the trouble. // Gary Coen , a flight director at the Johnson Space Center , said , " We still don ' t know why the sunshield wouldn ' t open . We think the arm might have collided with the sunshield. " // In any event , it was the mechanical arm that came to the rescue . With Mr. Lounge at the controls in the cabin , the " hand " end of the arm was pressed against the left side of the sunshield several times . The pressure finally forced the shield open. // On Discovery ' s fifth orbit of the earth , Mr. Lounge sent the commands to release Aussat 1 from the cargo bay and reported , " Deploy on time. " // Robert Springer , the crew communicator at Mission Control in Houston , radioed , " We all breathed a sigh of relief down here. " // A few hours later , Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System , reported that Aussat 1 " looks in good shape " with no apparent damage to its antenna as a result of the stuck sunshield. //
