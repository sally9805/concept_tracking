China drops hints about 1997 <P> Seven times since September 1982 , negotiators from China and Britain have gathered in Peking to discuss what will happen to Hong Kong after 1997 , when the British lease on 90% of the territory expires . Seven times they have emerged with vague statements that their discussions proved " useful and constructive . " But with the eighth round of talks due to begin this week in Peking , Chinese officials mysteriously became quite forthcoming . In San Francisco last week , Premier Zhao Ziyang declared that " Hong Kong will remain unchanged for at least 50 years after 1997 . " In an interview in the authoritative Peking weekly magazine Outlook ( circ. 300,000 ) , a Chinese spokesman on Hong Kong , Ji Pengfei , outlined a remarkably specific blueprint for absorbing that tiny outpost of capital ism into the vast citadel of Communism . <P> The gist of Ji 's proposal is that under Article 31 , introduced into the Chinese constitution 13 months ago , the British crown colony would become a " special administrative zone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port and retain its convertible dollar . The economic interests of Britain and other countries would , says Ji , be guaranteed by law . In addition , a locally selected administration would exercise independent judicial power and control its own system of passports and visas . All the new top officials would be Hong Kong residents of Chinese ancestry . <P> Beneath its surface , Ji 's statement delivered pointed messages to a variety of listeners . It told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who seems prepared to concede the sovereignty issue but hopes to see British officials running Hong Kong even after 1997 , that she may be disappointed . By reiterating that " all policies toward Hong Kong can also be applied to Taiwan , and Taiwan may receive even more favorable terms , " Zhao made apparent <P> China 's yearning to tempt Taiwan back into the administrative fold . In addition , the public optimism was doubtless designed to reassure Hong Kong 's notoriously jumpy financial markets . When negotiations were foundering last year , the Hang Seng stock market index dipped 25% in three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the market index soared above 1000 for the first time since August . <P> Yet the issue is by no means resolved . <P> Even if Britain accepts a proposal similar to Ji 's outline , how will a smooth transition be worked out ? Will the Chinese be as liberal in practice as they are on paper ? How , above all , can a country famous for its recent history of revolutions , revisions , upheavals and counterrevolutions guarantee the stability of the independent-minded city-state over the next 63 years ? Says a Hong Kong Chinese who has moved his residence to the U.S. : " If the Chinese could guarantee 50 years without change in Hong Kong , they would not be Communists . They would be capitalists .
