A former President must pay <P> In order to plug news leaks about the conduct of the Viet Nam War , President Richard Nixon in 1969 ordered illegal telephone taps on 17 Government of ficials and journalists . Last week , seven years after he was pardoned of any criminal charges arising from his tenure , a divided Supreme Court determined that Nixon is liable for civil damages to one of those whose privacy he had violated . <P> The suit was filed by Morton Halperin , who , as an aide to National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger , was suspected of leaking information about the secret bombing of Cambodia . The tap on Halperin 's home phone lasted 21 months , long after he had left the Government and joined the campaign staff of Democratic Presidential Candidate Edmund Muskie . No evidence was produced that Halperin had leaked classified information , and his lawyers charged that the eavesdropping was for political rather than security purposes . Nixon 's lawyers claimed that a President should be immune from suits arising from his official acts , so as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were divided 4 to 4 in the case ( William Rehnquist , who was an assistant attorney general at the time of the taps , recused himself ) . The decision therefore does not set any legal precedent , but it allows a lower court ruling in Halperin 's favor to stand . The high court last week also agreed to consider a suit brought by Ernest Fitzgerald , an Air Force official who says he was fired by Nixon for disclosing cost overruns . That case may settle more clearly whether a President can be sued for his actions in office . <P> A lower court will now assess damages against Nixon and two codefendants , former Attorney General John Mitchell and White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman . The court will also decide if Kissinger is liable . If Halperin , his wife and three sons are found to be eligible for the $100-a-day damages from each defendant , as specified by law , the family could collect more than $1 million . And it might not end there . Nixon faces similar suits from New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
