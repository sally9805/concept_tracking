 | That 's true , literally : most of us now watch " Sunset Boulevard " and other vintage films on home TV screens of 13 to 27 inches . Why ? Well , because we can . But what 's the convenience of home viewing when compared with the sweet pleasure of real moviegoing ? easing into a red velvet chair in the midst of convivial strangers , watching the lights go down , seeing a great old film ( or hell , even a lousy one ) flicker to life on a big movie-house screen ? Let 's see hands , please . Hmmm . . . No contest . Convenience wins . Sweet pleasure loses . The revival houses are dying . One distributor estimates that in 1980 there were 200 movie houses in the country that showed revival films , 75 that showed them exclusively . Today , he says , there are 15 . Focus on this . The Coolidge Corner theater in suburban Boston , a bastion of revival for 10 years , runs a Danny Kaye double feature on a spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Life of Walter Mitty " ? and sells 50 tickets all day . The owner has largely abandoned revivals for offbeat first-run films and second- run features . The Seattle-based Seven Gables chain makes plans to close its last revival house , the Cinema 21 in Portland , Ore . San Francisco 's Pagoda theater opens to much hoopla in 1985 ? and closes within two years . And in New York , the Thalia ? an Upper West Side shoe box that first played revivals in 1938 ? shuts its doors , apparently to be razed . This leaves Manhattan with just five houses that show any revival at all , down from 10 in 1980 . The box score is no less dismal elsewhere . Los Angeles is down to two , from eight in 1982 . Boston also has just two , down from six less than a decade ago . And in Seattle , which in 1978 supported a dozen theaters that showed some revival , there is exactly one today . What happened ? A relentless one-two punch has come from cable and video cassettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over certain films , " says president Steve Gilula of the California-based Landmark chain , which is down to five revival houses from a 1982 high of 24 . " Cult films like A Clockwork Orange ' or The Devils ' could n't be shown on free television . " Cable outlets like L.A. 's adventurous Z Channel soon loosened the grip of the revival houses on more daring films . Mainstream classics , meanwhile , began showing up in video stores . " Whether or not people actually rent Casablanca , ' they know they can , " says Donald Krim , president of Kino International , which distributes some 300 classic titles to theaters . " So when it plays at the Regency they wo n't run out as quickly to see it . " Classic titles now make up about 20 percent of Kino 's volume , and art films the rest . Five years ago the company handled older films exclusively . Increasing costs : Distributors come in for a share of the blame from revival exhibitors . Five years ago manager Dan Long of Seattle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today it costs him a guarantee of $100 to $150 against a percentage of ticket sales . The distributors , Long says , are still trying to cash in on the boom times that ran out in the early 1980s . Add to film rentals the increasing costs of labor , rent , printing and mailing a calendar , and shipping . " A long film like 1900 , ' with four big cans , could cost us $100 to ship , " says Long . Bruce Goldstein , who programmed the Thalia for a time and now programs Film Forum 2 in Manhattan , suggests another reason for lagging business : " The programming is no longer a novelty . When revival houses started spreading outside New York in the ' 70s , the films were novel . But there 's only so many old films you can show . " This point was illustrated recently in a way that unsettled followers of revivals . Film historians date the Bogart cult to a 1960s showing of " Casablanca " at the Brat-@#  | tle Theatre in Cambridge , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations of Boston college students . In March , when the theater last screened the movie , paired with " Gaslight , " it sold fewer tickets than " All About Eve/ " Beyond the Forest " and " Blonde Venus " / " Morocco " bills . Maybe this can be chalked up to simple burnout of a film that , while wonderfully entertaining , has become powerfully familiar . But maybe it can be laid to the most damaging development of all : a generational shift in moviegoers ' viewing habits . Howard Otway , who owns the Theatre 80 St. Marks in New York , suggests that cable and video cassette tend to cull out older , more sedentary viewers . Younger ones , meanwhile , never got into the revival habit at all . This college generation is really the TV generation , " says Cambridge Corner owner Justin Freed , who began his revival career at Cambridge 's Orson Welles theater in 1969 . " They 're not as aware of the difference between watching movies on TV and watching them in theaters . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rocky Horror Picture Show " bring in a dependable crowd every week . Freed only occasionally dabbles in revival now , as in May when he scheduled a Laurence Olivier festival for the actor 's 80th birthday . Theme bills like this are more popular than ever among revival exhibitors , who use them to pump new life into familiar films . " The Harold and Maude , ' Casablanca , " King of Hearts ' thing is just passe , " says George Mansour , owner of the Images Cinema in Williamstown , Mass . " But if you bring back Harold and Maude ' as part of an intergenerational sex film festival , you may have a hit . " Sandwich hoard : Other exhibitors lean more toward marketing flash . The Sono theater in Norwalk , Conn. , and the Fox International in Venice , Calif. , even have video-cassette counters ? a move that can be compared to not just inviting your enemy inside , but renting him the furnished room over the garage . " I 'd be stupid not to try to capture some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who estimates that video rentals now make up $500 of his $3,200 weekly gross . A comedy group called the L.A. Connection appears once a month at the Nuart in West Los Angeles ; owner Garen Daly schedules three or four live dates a month at his Somerville Theatre near Cambridge ? concerts , comedy and kids ' shows ? and promotes aggressively , sending a man in a sandwich board down to Harvard Square .
