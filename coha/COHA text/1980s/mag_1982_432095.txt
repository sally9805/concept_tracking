 | On the day she graduated from the University of Southern California last month , magna cum laude in English , Gretchen Radke had " an empty feeling . " Although she had been accepted into a Ph.D . program at the University of Virginia , Radke was enrolling in business school at Boston University . " I 'm going to miss English , " she says . " But business was a more practical thing to do . " Unfortunately , what is practical for Radke and thousands of students like her may be disastrous for higher education . " Some of the brightest undergraduates are not considering academic careers , " says Robert F. Goheen , director of the Mellon Fellowships in the Humanities , a new program to encourage graduate study . As a result , scholars worry , universities will face a shortage of new teaching talent perhaps as soon as the next decade . For several years now , college graduates have been abandoning the classroom for more lucrative careers in the boardroom , the courtroom and the operating room . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members in the 1960s , and the demand for new ones has fallen to a whisper in these times of retrenchment . " The job market is practically nonexistent , " says history Prof. E. Bradford Burns of the University of California at Los Angeles , who advises his students to stay away from teaching . But the demographics point to a turnaround in the late 1990s , when the college-age population will increase and large numbers of tenured faculty will approach retirement . " We can not afford a situation in which able people stay away from graduate school , " cautions Princeton University president William Bowen . Decline : According to Harvard , the number of its summa cum laude seniors who went on to graduate school dropped from 77 percent in 1964 to 31 percent last year . A new study by the Consortium on Financing Higher Education shows sharp declines in the numbers of students applying for graduate work in the humanities departments of twenty prestigious colleges and universities . Collectively those departments lost an estimated 43 percent of their applicants from 1972 to 1980 and enrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , received an average of 358 applica- tions in 1972 and just 184 in 1980 ; history departments enrolled seventeen graduate students in 1980 , half the 1972 number . Over the last decade there was also a steep drop in the number of students taking the Graduate Record Examinations achievement tests in the humanities ? an indication that fewer students plan to attend graduate school in those fields . Many graduate-school deans insist they are still getting top students , and some suggest that the hardy souls now seeking Ph.D . ' s represent the committed scholars who really belong in academia . Goheen , a former president of Princeton , is not so sure . " The issue is not numbers but quality , " he says . " There are people who love the intellectual life , who are not commercially motivated , but who simply do n't have the talent . " Adds John Gryder , associate dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins : " The humanities are at a great disadvantage right now . " Gryder fears that the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be difficult to keep operating the programs . " Humanities departments are not the only ones worried about the prospect of empty professional chairs . For engineering and business schools , the famine has already arrived ? because there are so many well-paying jobs in the field that few good students even give teaching a thought . " The situation with respect to Ph.D . ' s in engineering is atrocious , " says Robert Page , dean of the engineering school at Texas A &M.; Last year the nation 's colleges and universities awarded 45 percent more bachelor 's degrees in engineering than in 1972 , but 30 percent fewer Ph.D . ' s ? and nearly half of those went to foreign nationals who may not stay in the country . Raising professors ' salaries to compete with the $24,000 a B. S. can earn does n't always help ; A &M; tried , but this month it is losing two faculty members to six-figure jobs in industry . Twenty percent of business school faculty positions are also vacant . " It 's a sellers ' market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Amos Tuck School of Business Administration , who last year filled three of seven faculty vacancies ? only to lose three others . William Dill , a former dean at New York University , was so desperate that he hired a philosophy Ph.D . as an accounting professor . Practical : Ph.D . programs in the humanities have traditionally been vocational training for the ivory tower . Rebecca West . dean of students in the Humanities Division at the University of Chicago , would like to broaden that outlook ? and keep good people in graduate school ? by " changing the emphasis in various programs so that students will not necessarily study with the goal of working in an academic context . " Last month , after two years of study , a faculty commission at Chicago issued a list of recommendations to make Ph.D . programs more appealing ? and more practical . It suggested combining some disciplines ( international politics and foreign languages , for example ) , reducing the time spent on course work and providing more financial support for postdoctoral research in the humanities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate students , even devoted scholars need fiscal incentives . To that end the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation is underwriting a $24 million humanities fellowship program to be administered by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in Princeton . Starting in the fall of 1983 , as many as 125 graduate students in a dozen or more universities will receive stipends of $7,000 and have their tuition paid in full . Fellows recommended by their departments will continue to receive money in the second year , and those who have done superior work will be supported while they complete their dissertations . The grants , says Goheen , are designed to encourage " people with a yen for the intellectual life who feel they ca n't pursue a career in the humanities because the economic prospects are so forbidding . " Goheen has formed a national committee and seven regional committees to act as talent scouts . In fifteen years , he promises , " we will have a considerable impact on humanistic education .
