The G.O.P. grabs itself four Guvs <P> The Reagan quake that rocked the nation did not stop at the White House and halls of Congress . As the chandeliers swung , Democrats tumbled out of four Governors ' mansions too . Of the 13 Governors ' races , ten involved states held by Democrats . By winning seven of the 13 , the Republicans slashed the Democratic gubernatorial edge from 31 to 19 , to 27 to 23 , As expected , the two Republican incumbents-Delaware 's Pierre S. Du Pont IV and Vermont 's Richard Snelling coasted to victory , while Indiana 's Lieutenant Governor Robert Orr succeeded his retiring G.O.P. predecessor , Otis Bowen . There was a mild upset in North Dakota , where Republican State Attorney General Allen Olson edged out the incumbent , Democrat Arthur Link . Democratic Governors won re-election in North Carolina , New Hampshire , Rhode Island and Utah . In Montana , Democratic Lieutenant Governor Ted Schwinden won the top job after upsetting Governor Thomas Judge in the primary . It may be days before the outcome is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos Romero Barcelo finished in a virtual dead heat with former Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon , who favors keeping the island 's commonwealth status . <P> Four of the most intriguing races : <P> Missouri . Republican Christopher ( " Kit " ) Bond , 41 , was a rising star of the G.O.P. until he was unexpectedly defeated for a second term as Governor by Democrat Joseph Teasdale in 1976 . Now Bond is shining once again after beating Teasdale , 53% to 47% . As he did in 1976 , Teasdale depicted himself as an advocate of the common man and hit hard at Bond 's patrician upbringing ( **30;5674;TOOLONG of Virginia ) . <P> Bond parried the attacks by stumping vigorously across the state , jacket off and tie loosened . He ripped Teasdale as an incompetent administrator who appointed cronies to government jobs and had never delivered on his promise to lower electric utility rates . Said Bond : " I 'm not going to make a lot of promises , because I ca n't outpromise the Great Promiser . " <P> West Virginia . Ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Jay " ) Rockefeller IV , 43 , has been believed to nourish hopes of entering the national political arena-but only after winning a second term as Governor . He easily defeated his Republican opponent , scrappy former Governor Arch Moore , 57 , but at an eyebrow-raising cost : Rockefeller spent an estimated $9.5 million , all but $200,000 of it from his personal funds . When a final accounting is made , he may beat the gubernatorial record of $10 million spent by his Uncle Nelson in New York in 1966 . <P> Rockefeller 's spending became the main issue of the campaign . Moore , whose expenses totaled $814,000 , denounced his opponent for " trying to buy the election , " but Rockefeller deflected the criticism by arguing that his inherited wealth insulated him from pressure by special-interest groups . Moore belittled Rockefeller 's claim that he wielded clout in Washington in developing a national coal policy favorable to the state . Rockefeller , however , took credit for West Virginia 's increased coal production ( up to 112 million tons in 1979 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second term-and possibly a platform from which to launch a national career .
