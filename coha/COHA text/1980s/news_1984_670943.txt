His announcement temporarily dashed the hopes of thousands of other citizens , including artists , writers , journalists , entertainers , celebrities and students , who have flooded the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in recent years with requests that they be flown into space. // But they and others from occupations that lost out this time may yet get their chance . The space agency said it expected to take the teacher aloft in late 1985 or early 1986 and thereafter would fly from two to four private citizens a year on shuttle missions. // // // Eyes and Ears of Public // The citizen passengers are intended to serve as the eyes and ears of the public , observing the wonders of space flight and later communicating what they observe in understandable and more exciting terms than those generally used by astronauts , who are chosen more for technical skills than for communications ability. // James M. Beggs , administrator of the space agency , said it had decided to choose an educator because teachers are good communicators , have a life- long effect on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , science and mathematics and to excel. // " This agency lives and dies by whether we can attract top talent and keep the kids interested in the program , " he said at a news conference. // <> <> Reagan Tells the Teachers // Mr. Beggs said his agency was under no political pressure to choose a teacher in this election year when both parties are seeking the support of articulate and organized teachers ' groups . He said the agency gave the President several options but ranked educators at the top of the list. // While the agency was stressing what teachers could do as communicators for the country , the President , in a speech to teachers and administrators from outstanding secondary schools , was stressing what his space decision would do for the image of teachers. // " It has been a goal of our space shuttle program to some day carry citizen passengers into space , " he said . " Until now we had not decided who the first citizen passenger would be. " // " But today , " he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our elementary and secondary schools and to choose as the first citizen passenger in the history of our space program one of America ' s finest : a teacher. " // " When that shuttle lifts off , " he told his politely applauding audience , " all of America will be reminded of the crucial role teachers and education play in the life of our nation . I can ' t think of a better lesson for our children , and our country. " // The meeting was one of two visits by the President at which the theme was education . He spent part of the morning at Jefferson Junior High School in southwest Washington , which has been singled out by the Department of Education for excellence . ( Page B5 . ) At the N.A.S.A. news conference , Mr. Beggs said that as the program matured , passengers would be selected " from all areas of American life " and eventually , perhaps , from foreign countries as well . He suggested , for example , that " someone from the labor movement , " perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , might be chosen as a way to motivate other workers. // Mr. Beggs said a lottery to choose the passengers was considered but was rejected because the winner might not qualify for medical or other reasons to go aloft. // The physical and psychological requirements for the citizen passengers are not expected to be onerous . Mr. Beggs said the space shuttle has a " benign , shirt-sleeved environment " that " allows a reasonably healthy person to fly there with nothing more than relatively rudimentary training and the desire to do so. " // The passengers must be free of disease or injury that would interfere with performing the mission , escaping in an emergency , or using the equipment . In addition , they must have vision correctable to 20/40 in their better eye , be able to hear a whispered voice at three feet , although a hearing aid is permissible , and have blood pressure readings of less than 160/100 , a level that doctors define as moderate hypertension . <> <> Competition for the Seat // The competition will be open to anyone teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , private or parochial school in the United States , Puerto Rico , Guam , and the outlying American territories , as well as in the Defense Department ' s overseas schools for dependents . The applicants must be United States citizens. // The space agency said it would send out an announcement in early October listing the requirements and procedures for applicants . Any applications sent before then will not be accepted . The application period will run from Nov. 1 until Jan. 1 . Recorded status reports on the program are available by calling ( 202 ) 453-8644. // Agency officials said they expected as many as 80 , 000 applications from among the nation ' s two million schoolteachers . The applicants will have to submit a proposal describing their qualifications and explain how they would use their experience in space . <> <> Educators to Help Choose // The applications will go through an initial screening at the space agency and then further screening by panels of educators in each state . Two candidates will be selected from each state or other jurisdiction . The group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 by a national panel . The winner and an alternate would ultimately be selected by the agency. // The passengers would be expected to go through perhaps eight weeks of training before their flight , at the Johnson Space Center in Texas and the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . On the mission , they will be asked to perform normal housekeeping , including operating the food and hygiene systems and hatches . The educator will probably also be involved in student experiments or other scientific work aboard . But the educator need not be a teacher of science or mathematics . <> <> A ' Hot Property for Us ' // After returning to Earth , the passenger will have to spend a year performing communications and education missions for N.A.S.A. , just as astronauts now spend substantial time addressing citizen ' s groups. // " We don ' t expect them to keep it to themselves , " said Mr. Beggs . " They ' d better be aware they ' re going to be a hot property for us. " // Mr. Beggs said it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his experience for profit . " But he said that , once an individual had satisfied obligations to the agency , " if there are profit opportunities for him , good luck , and God bless him. " //
