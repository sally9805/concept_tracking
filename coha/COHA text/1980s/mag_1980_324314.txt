Jimmy Carter has been his own calamity for so long that it is hard to get out of the habit of living with disappointment and near disaster . But last week , when the President stepped down from Air Force One at the end of his European voyage , he had not only staved off a further collapse of American leadership in the world but had also shored up for a time the cause of the democracies . <P> An avalanche of mismanagement still follows on Carter 's heels and could engulf us any moment . But his eight-day display of determination and adroit maneuver has added a lustrous footnote to the pages of his thin volume of leadership success . Nothing more , or less . <P> His stubborn effort to unite the allies against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan gave Carter a direction and force heretofore lacking . Then he used the new political unity to ease the way for a truly remarkable economic and energy agenda for the future . Meetings do not make the world , but they help a little . <P> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonn , Jimmy Carter smiled . Little else . Germany 's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt sat down the table from the U.S. President and swirled Coca-Cola around in his wine glass and looked with contempt along his tilted nose at Carter . Schmidt dominated the personalities , France 's Valry Giscard d'Estaing was clearly second , and Carter was down there some place with Britain 's jolly James Callaghan , who did not survive Margaret Thatcher 's political assault , who did not survive Margaret Thatcher 's political assault . <P> The rankings changed this time . Carter had what for him was fire in his eye . Strategy had been carefully crafted for six months . He held to it like a bulldog . And when the seven leaders gathered around the head table in Venice for their final declarations , Jimmy Carter was first among the equals . The real bulldog , Mrs. Thatcher , was next in line . Giscard , still elegant , but surprised , and Schmidt , more than a bit tarnished by being a bit too Germanic , were tied for third . <P> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearly defined goal is shown again to be the core of successful statecraft . Being consistent is another vital ingredient . Having help from home does wonders too . The news that the U.S. had made more progress in oil conservation than any of the other nations deepened the impact of Carter 's words on everyone . There is little question that at last the President moved with some confidence and understanding among the other leaders . <P> Whether he can sustain his skill remains to be seen . Carter was profoundly impressed with the Roman Colosseum and Forum , which he had never seen before . Venice fascinated him by being so much different from anything he had known or expected . But as he sped toward home , the images of imperial grandeur faded . The President still seems to yearn for self-denial and simplicity , which are terribly hard to come by in the crowd with which he travels .
