The scene : Room 5110 of the Dirksen Senate Office building . The occasion : the first public meeting of the bipartisan National Commission on Social Security Reform to take place since the President and Senate Budget Committee called for $40 billion in cuts in the system over the next three years . The result : a partisan shouting match , with cameras clicking , that symbolized the tensions evoked by this sensitive issue . <P> Republican Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania , who is running for a second term this fall , announced that he was tired of hearing that his party was " trying to balance the budget on the backs of Social Security recipients . " He proposed separating the program from the overall budget , as one way to avoid " a lot of political posturing . " Heinz 's proposal drew support from other commissioners , but then the fun began . <P> Florida Democrat Claude Pepper , 81 , who heads the House Select Committee on Aging , wondered if television cameras would be required to leave the meeting after ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the commission 's chairman . The TV crews could stay as long as they liked . Meanwhile , Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York was incensed about the entire proceedings . Heinz 's proposal was fine for the future , he said , but " we are facing a crisis of the present . " Since the Senate Budget Committee " ordered this commission to cut $40 billion , " Moynihan complained , " we 've been told in advance what we must report . " Chimed in Pepper : " People must be in a grave quandary " with talk of $40 billion in cutbacks coming on top of presidential assurances that benefits will be protected . " What are people to believe ? " he drawled . " This commission has been compromised . " Moynihan was just getting wound up . The Reagan Administration , he fumed , has " terrorized older people into thinking that they wo n't get their Social Security . " <P> That statement triggered the fury of Colorado 's Republican Senator William Armstrong . " I 'm dismayed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My colleague from New York on the Senate floor has demagogued this issue from front to back and top to bottom and he is trying to do the same here , " he said . " You 've tried to emotionalize what should not be an emotional issue . We have done everything to avoid making this a partisan issue , " Armstrong declared , just before charging that the proposal for the $40 billion cutback originated with the Democrats . <P> Pepper demanded that Chairman Greenspan rebuke Armstrong : " If one member can make an assault on another , we become a brawling group . " Greenspan mildly reiterated his hope that " we can keep the rhetoric down to an absolute minimum . " Wisecracked Republican Senator Robert Dole of Kansas : " We carry on like this all the time on the floor of the House and the Senate . "
