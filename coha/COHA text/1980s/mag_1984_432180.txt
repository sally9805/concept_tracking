 | OK , now . Start the spin by standing on your head ; then push off with your hands and pump your legs in the air . Sound too tough ? Well then , try a hand glide instead : crouch down , put all your weight on your left hand , then hoist your body into the air and start spinning by shoving off with your right . No way ? Maybe you should stick to something simpler like the moonwalkyou know , the way Michael Jackson seems to glide on air in his videos . Or how about a little poppin ' and lockin ' ? Better yet , why do n't you just sit this one out ? Break-dancing ? that acrobatic form born in the South Bronx in which the dancer often spins on his head or his back or his hands ? is not for the fainthearted or brittleboned , as some health officials are warning . But anyone can watch , and this summer everyone is . Ever since the Rock Steady Crew of New York performed a few moves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young breakers have been turning up on city street corners , their beat boxes blaring , giving the mimes and street musicians a run for the loose change of passers-by . They spin on MTV videos , hawk hamburgers and soda pop in television commercials , perform live at bar mitzvahs and birthday parties . The San Francisco Ballet opened its season with a gala featuring 46 breakdancers ; the Los Angeles Olympics will close with 100 of them . And last week , " Breakdancing " topped The New York Times paperback how-to best-seller list . When the film " Breakin ' , " about a trio of @# West Coast break-dancers , opened in May , it had young moviegoers literally dancing in the aisles . " Beat Street , " a movie featuring New York musicians and breakdancers , opened three weeks ago , and no fewer than six other pictures about break-dancing are in production . " Changing the field of gravity of the dancer is revolutionary , " enthuses Akiva Talmi , a ballet promoter now working with break-dancers . " As revolutionary as the addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While most people do n't possess the daring , skill or strength for break-dancing , the fascination with it is part of a huge revival in dancing in general . Not since John Travolta strutted onto the disco floor in " Saturday Night Fever " have dance floors been so crowded ; once again the trend has been partly fueled by film , especially such movies as " Flashdance " and this spring 's hit , " Footloose , " with its charttopping pop soundtrack . But dancing is no longer confined to Saturday night : in Miami Beach , the outrageous new Club Z is jammed seven nights a week . In New York , the chic discos of a decade ago have all but been replaced by a dozen newer spots that feature everything from ' 50s rock and roll to breaking . In Houston , folks are still dancing cowboy steps , but even the famed Gilley 's now books rock acts . Like break-dancing , social dancing is individualistic and has never been more diverse . As a 27-year-old chemist at a San Francisco tea dance puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a democratic era in dance . " Sometimes the new dance scene is n't strictly recreational . On a hot Sunday afternoon on the boardwalk in Venice , Calif. , a young Asian approaches a black youth and challenges him to battle . As a crowd begins to gather and the beat box blares the music , the first boy , nervous and sweating , tenses his arms , jerks his wrists and elbows in syncopation , then " pops " his shoulder muscles . The other boy watches with disdain , hurling insults until it is his turn . Stepping into the tight circle in his baggy pants , T shirt and beret , he executes a series of intricate maneuvers , popping his limbs with cool finesse . The crowd bursts into applause and he wins by approbation . Graffiti : As ritualistic as a 19th-century duel , break-dancing has become the hip way to settle a score . But whether a martial art or a contemporary dance form , it is mostly a male macho spectator sport , usually executed solo or in pairs . It started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Bronx , where restless energy erupted into street violence to the constant clacking of the subway trains . In the early ' 70s , James Brown 's frenetic jiving on TV to his hit song , " Get on the Good Foot , " may have helped inspire Bronx gangs already engaged in dance warfare , as did Kung Fu movies  | and comic books . On TV 's " Soul Train , " the future Lockers , choreographed by Toni Basil , were doing something like breakdancing . Breaking evolved as part of the " hip hop " ( the term came from a rap song ) subculture , whose high priest , Afrika Barnbaataa , became its impresario : he founded the Zulu Nation , a loose confederation of Bronx dance crews , graffiti artists and rap musicians , to channel violent energy into creativity . When Bambaataa 's own rap record with Soulsonic Force , " Planet Rock , " became a hit on the dance charts and sold more than 600,000 copies by 1983 , hip hop was no longer a provincial movement but had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes . Riffs : " The dancers started breaking ' cause it was symbolic of the streets , " says Bruce Smolanoff , 20 , of Queens , N.Y. , a member of the Big Apple Breakers . The fighting prowess-turned-peaceful had its parallel in the defacement of subway cars turned into an art form inspired by comic books . But nowhere was the message of hip hop more explicit than in the music . Homegrown Bronx disc jockeys would play riffs from their favorite records ? often " scratching " over them to create a new sound ? and add new beats with a drum synthesizer . Then someone might record a rap over the whole thing : " Deep in the city/ People live in the streets/You got to be careful of everyone you meet/There 's lootin ' , there 's shootin ' /People stabbin ' and grabbin ' /The innocent bystander the police are grabbin ' /Ai n't it a pity ' cause you hate the city /But the way you feel ai n't no big deal/You 've got to survive . " * In some parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough urban spirit . At North High School in Denver , where fighting erupts regularly between rival gangs , kids have begun to break-dance in the hallways between classes . " It 's a way to be No. 1 without blowing somebody away , " says Pierre Jiminez , director of a Denver juvenile-delinquency program who pushed for a citysponsored break-dance contest . In San Francisco , 16-year-old Jarvis La Casse , whose street name or " tag " is " Jay Rock , " says , " If you told me a few years ago that I 'd be dancing , I 'd laugh . It 's like a thing : gangs getting ready to fight , but instead we dance . " But break-dancing is no longer the private domain of urban street kids , especially now that two big summer movies are bringing the world of break-dancing lockin ' and poppin ' onto Main Street , U.S.A. Consider " Breakin ' " : the quickie movie released by Cannon Films in mid-May has grossed nearly $31 million thus far at the box office , and the sound track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Los Angeles and Venice , Calif. , the movie has a trite , " Flashdance " - style story line about a chorus girl who discovers break-dancers and tries to convince her jazz-dance coach that they are as good as the pros . But the film has a lot of raw energy in the dance footage , especially as performedby two splendid break-dancers ? " Shabba-Doo " ( box , page 50 ) and " Boogaloo Shrimp " ? in the lead roles . Crash Course : Hot on the sneaker heels of " Breakin ' " carne the slick Harry BelafonteDavid Picker production " Beat Street , " starring Guy Davis , Jon Chardiet and Rae Dawn Chong . A crash course in the hip-hop culture , it loosely dances around the friendship of a Hispanic subway graffiti artist and a black would-be deejay who " mixes " recordings to create new music in his South Bronx bedroom and dreams of a far bigger sound booth . Along the way are dollops of local color and lingo : kids wear Pumas because they 're " fresh " ( good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( bad ) ; they rumble with their break-dance crews in color-co-@#  | ordinated jogging outfits ; they dance at dingy clubs in the Bronx , where they 're frisked at the door , or go downtown to Manhattan 's glitzy Roxy ( where in real life kids may also be frisked at the door ) . Unlike the scene in the semidocumentary " Wild Style , " a gritty film about hip hop made in 1981 , the South Bronx of " Beat Street " is almost squeaky clean ? squalid , yes , but not a sign of drugs , knives , guns and certainly not much sex . Robert Taylor , 16 , a spectacular break-dancer who was discovered by the filmmakers on a South Bronx playground , makes a credible acting debut , and the film features a " chill " ( i.e. , cool ) parade of hip-hop performers ? Afrika Bambaataa , the legendary deejay Kool Here , rapper Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five , the Rock Steady Crew and the New York City Breakers . The soundtrack album has already sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking hit the heartland . In DeWitt , Mich. ( population 3,596 ) , Russell Brown teaches the moves to a class of 11-and 12-year-olds . His pupils break the demographic rules ? they are all white and mostly girls . In Houston , Texas , 10-yearold Levon Schwartz has been learning how to break from the public-school kids who come for twice-weekly Hebrew class at his Jewish day school . " Michael Jackson sent out the word to stop fighting and start dancing , " says Levon , who 's also a fan of Herbie Hancock 's hit " Rockit . " " If you have a really good floor , you can spin around on your head . But I would n't recommend trying it on cement , ' cause you 'd probably end up on your back doing the worm . " Clumsy : Nasrollah Samiy , who just got his degree from Harvard in organic chemistry , hired Jonathan Deas , 19 , a street dancer in Harvard Square , to teach him the electric boogie for $4 an hour . " His friends would watch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach this clumsy white kid how to breakdance . " To cap the lessons , Samiy ? with Deas ? performed the electric boogie for Harvard 's class of ' 84 senior dinner . J For many breakers dancing is such a serious business that they rarely perform in public , except in formal contests . " You do n't want people biting stealing your moves , " explains Simon Elbling , 15 , of the Double Vision Crew from Santa Monica . Beyond the gifted amateurs who compete are a handful of street dancers trained to professional standards , ready to boogie right into a job in aTV commercial or music video . For Jose ( Mr. Speedbreak ) Roman , 19 , of the Big Apple Breakers , " the moves are getting harder . " Ever striving for new routines , Roman , who practices three or four hours a day , is perfecting a " 1990 " ? a dive into a handstand with a 180-degree twist . Milton ( Kano ) Torres , 18 , of the Dynamic Breakers , from Queens , N.Y. , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of a vertical dancer ) and the helicopter ( one dancer spins while supporting two interlocked dancers on his shoulders ) . Even so , he says , " we have to keep inventing new moves so that we stay on top . " In Los Angeles , the L.A. Breakers Breakdance Company , founded by former deejay and " Soul Train " dancer Michael Khalfani , 27 , is a loose professional organization of 125 breakers from 4 to 22 available for commercials , movies and public appearances . One requirement : that students maintain at least a C average . Khalfani believes that break-dancing will eventually become an American cultural classic like tap-dancing , but some disagree , arguing that break-dancing is already threatened by overexposure . " When street kids no longer feel it belongs to them , they 'll no longer want it , " predicts Jiminez of Denver . Already the average consumer can buy a video cassette to learn how to break . " Now that breaking is being commercialized , " says Smolanoff of the Big Apple Breakers , " it ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . " Acrobatic : The most cynical observers think the entertainment industry will swallow up break-dancing as it did disco . But it 's hard to deny the vitality of the form in the places where it first sprang into the mainstream ? the New York dance clubs . At the Fun House , on Manhattan 's lower West Side , kids from the boroughs have been breaking for half a dozen years . Blacks ' ; ; ' Hispanics and Italians used to stake out their own turf ? or even their own night ? at the Fun House , but there is more mixing now . And as dance styles change , breaking there is evolving into a kind of kick dancing . " It is more acrobatic , " notes Fun House owner Ronnie Bryser . " The white kids have taken it up and made it more gymnastic , athletic . " A few blocks away at the Roxy , the dance club featured in the glittery finale of " Beat Street , " new breakers still come to test their latest spins and flips on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rink . The Roxy was @#  | the original showcase for some of the hot crews from the Bronx who have turned professional , such as the New York City Breakers and the Rock Steady Crew . " My mission was to tell white people about this . This is a cross-cultural exchange , " says Steve Haenel , the Roxy 's owner and selfstyled break impresario , who is white . Unlike the Roxy and the Fun House , most dance clubs are n't a crossroads where hip hop meets the white middle class , but the hippest dance spots in the country are feeling the influence of breaking . " A lot of aspects of street dancing are affecting disco and jazz , such as the locking ? the quick , fast-punching-type move , " says Rick Atwell , a choreographer at work on the movie " Shoot Out " and an off-Broadway musical , " Street Heat . " Akiva Talmi agrees : " The vocabulary of movement of electric boogie is here to stay , " and in spots like Denver 's splashy new Mardi Gras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd the floor most weekends . For many dancers weary of disco 's relentless and repetitive beat , the most exciting music today is mixed live . The deejay has become an artist , a one-man band whose showcase is the dance club . Today , as many as a third of the standard pop singles in the Top 20 have a companion 12-inch remixed dance version in release as well . " Planet Rock " producer and " Beat Street " music coordinator Arthur Baker , at 29 the granddaddy of hip-hop mixing , has been called in to mix the longer dance versions of two Cyndi Lauper hits and one song on the new Bruce Springsteen album ; star Fun House deejay John ( Jellybean ) Benitez has mixed for Michael Jackson . Meanwhile , rap continues to find a wider audience with message songs such as " White Lines " by Melle Mel and the Furious Five , about the dangers of cocaine . Music writer Vince Aletti , who is also the dance-record buyer for Tower Records in New York , could n't believe the extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming in at one point , saying , I 've got to have the " Sucker M.C. 's " by rap group Run-D.M.C. record ' , " he says . High Tech : Those same preppy white kids are likely to spend part of any good club crawl in New York at Area , one of the hottest mainstream spots of the moment . The club , which features scratch/rap music along with a variety of new wave and old rock , is a cross between a ' 60s happening and a theme park . From fashion models to novelist William Burroughs , the club 's patrons come to dance and gawk at the periodically changing motifs ? decor based one month on suburbia ? giant boxes of Tide , a paneled rec room ? another month on the @#  | color red ? roses , a brothel , a sports car , candy apples . Uptown from Area is The Limelight ? a club in a former church , complete with nave , pulpit and stained-glass windows . The 10,000 mortals who pass through the portals each week will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projectors will light up the entire church ceiling with rock videos . The Metro on Boston 's Kenmore Square and its adjacent sister club , Spit , share 22,000 square feet of dance floor . Even so , Saturday nights are jammed , and the owner has launched Metro to Go : catered dance programming complete with deejay and music for private parties . In Los Angeles , in an effort to transform that early-to-bed town into a city that never sleeps , young entrepreneurs have created floating afterhours spots ? no-frills private dance clubs held in a restaurant or bar after closing . Tim Kelly , son of dancer Gene , started the popular Nairobi Room in a restaurant , then moved it to the ' 20s-style ballroom of the Park Plaza Hotel . The newest spot , the Mix Club , is in the once famous Stardust Ballroom on Sunset Boulevard ? spruced up a bit with whitewash and graffiti art . Heavy Metal : There is little doubt , as Metro deejay Wendy Hunt puts it , that " the whole dance scene has exploded . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant , dances to the heavy-metal sound at the I-Beam on Haight Street in black leather pants and black lace top . " It 's better than aerobics and just as cheap , " she says . Kelly Bevy , 19 , and her friend , Debbye Egger , 19 , say they watch MTV " 24 hours a day " when not working and like to dance at Cardi 's in Houston twice a week . " Flashdance " inspired Bevy ; Egger says she is moved by " the king of dancing , " Michael Jackson . Gone these days is the pressure to look like the couple that won last week on " Dance Fever . " In fact , a lot of dancers do n't feel they have to be part of a couple at all ; in rock clubs all over , dancers dance alone , with their image in a mirror , in trios or with a member of the same sex . One recent evening at Scooter 's in Atlanta , as the speakers blared " . . . No parking , baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record by the group Midnight Star , the elevated platform at one end of the dance floor held five women and two men , all dancing oblivious to each other . " I honestly do n't think I can dance with a partner , " said Paul Fox , 20 . " I go too crazy . I got ta have some room . " For some , no dance spot is as much fun as one that reminds them of their earliest dance-floor triumphs ? a high-school gym . At Heartbreak , a downtown Manhattan club that looks like a school cafeteria , the Big Chill generation rocks out to Elvis , Dion , Chuck Berry and old Motown hits . But the ultimate nostalgia club is probably Juke Box Saturday Night in Chicago , a spot so popular that it has two branches in the suburbs of the Windy City itself and another that will open in Minneapolis in August . Decorated with old jukeboxes , vintage Coke signs , a miniature sandy beach and giant paintings of Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon , the club is a haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the locomotion , the twist , the stroll , the jerk , the hand jive . Tea Dance : A lot of youngsters might think touch dancing is really " wack , " but it is as much a part of the dance explosion as breaking . Among the 2 million Americans who regularly trot out to two-step are the 300 elite members of the Washington Waltz Group and friends , who include Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Byron White and Lewis Powell . In a suburb of the capital , Keiko Moore and David Martin , members of the thriving U.S. Amateur Ballroom Dance Association , regularly polish their steps and timing for competition . Teenagers are touch-dancing at proms . In San Francisco 's Mission District at a club called Cesar 's , men in flashy white or red suits swivel their partners in an elegant salsa . At a small continental restaurant in Coconut Grove , Fla. , couples have been known to suddenly take to the floor and weave among the tables in a slinky tango . Latin nights are part of a boom at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under glittering spheres since @#  | 1919 . At the elegant new Park Suite Hotel in Denver , some 200 people waltz and fox-trot every Friday night to big-band music ; in San Francisco , an often young crowd jams the Hyatt Regency for afternoon tea dances . At the Hyatt 's dance one Friday , David Epner , 51 , a New York attorney on business in San Francisco , says he tries to find a tea dance in every city he visits : " This is a middle-age singles ' bar . If you meet someone , you have a date tonight . If you do n't , you 've had a good time dancing . " One recent Saturday night at the Surf Club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan , a group of aging preppies danced to the old Isley Brothers hit " Shout . " Strands of pearls and club ties flying , they raised their arms in the air and shouted , " Shout , " on cue . This song was popular 20 years ago , and the people dancing to it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's all liberating and then some . As a young woman pointed out at Heartbreak , " Dancing is just another sense . When I 'm dancing I do n't care about anything else , just body and motion and listening to music . Today I heard on the news that the Russians are putting more submarines around the country ? who wants to deal with that ? " Many Americans obviously do n't . Whether they 're lockin ' and poppin ' , boogieing or bopping , they 're dancing the night away . @#
