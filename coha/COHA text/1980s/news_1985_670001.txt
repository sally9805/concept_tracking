HARTFORD , Conn.  --  When Times Mirror Co. bought the Hartford Courant for $106 million in 1979 , it vowed to improve the 221-year-old newspaper . Six years later , the Courant has gone through three sets of editors and more than 100 reporters and changed its coverage back and forth from local to statewide views . One set of editors sent in from the Los Angeles Times , and dubbed the Beach Boys , reduced suburban coverage , snubbed local business leaders  --  and alienated readers . Another set from the Kansas City ( Mo . ) Star , called the Kansas City Chiefs , increased local coverage , played up to local business interests  --  and angered the staff . Los Angeles-based Times Mirror ' s record in Hartford illustrates how even the best-intentioned chain can stumble when trying to take over a local newspaper . And newspapers are hot property these days . Gannett Co. , for instance , recently paid about $255 million for the Des Moines Register and $717 million for Evening News Association , which owns the Detroit News . David Laventhol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Times Mirror has learned a painful lesson from the Courant ' s turmoil . " If you change a newspaper , change it carefully , " he notes . " Newspapers are a lot like old shoes . Some people would rather wear old shoes than the shiny new ones you offer them . " Times Mirror gave the Courant a face lift and improved its sports , features and business coverage , but it also substantially reduced local coverage . Adverse reaction to some of these changes was predictable in Connecticut , whose nickname is The Land of Steady Habits . But Times Mirror has managed change so poorly that the Courant " has lost touch with a lot of people who read the paper , " says Marc Gunther , a Courant veteran who left this year to become television critic of the Detroit News . Times Mirror , which owns eight newspapers including the prestigious Los Angeles Times and Long Island ' s Newsday , had both talent and money to offer . Last year , Times Mirror earned $232. 7 million , or $3. 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far it has spent about $40 million improving the Courant ' s plant and printing presses and has added 100 employees to bring the Courant ' s newsroom staff to 275 . The Courant ' s strength was the 16 bureaus it maintained in Connecticut , which together produced daily news stories on half of the state ' s 169 towns . That suburban coverage had helped the Courant eclipse the rival Hartford Times , which folded in 1976 , giving the Courant a lucrative monopoly in Connecticut ' s largest metropolitan area . " The Courant was a paper of record ad absurdum , " says Kenneth Hooker , a former Courant business editor who is now editor of New England Business magazine . " But you could find in it a nugget of information you couldn ' t find elsewhere . " About a year after purchasing the Courant , Times Mirror named Mark Murphy , Los Angeles Times metropolitan editor , as editor . Mr. Murphy , an ebullient , aggressive newsman , increased the business-section staff from three to 10 , spruced up the Sunday magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Red Sox and Boston Celtics . He also encouraged reporters to write long news analyses , a Los Angeles Times hallmark . But Mr. Murphy was disdainful of some of his staff . In a magazine interview , he lambasted the Courant in its pre-Times Mirror days as " an embarrassment to the profession . " He closed half the Courant ' s Connecticut bureaus while he opened one in Boston and expanded one in Washington D.C. , leading to charges that he was forsaking local coverage for more glamorous stories . Mr. Murphy says he was " swinging the pendulum to a statewide approach , " but a community leader organized pickets against the newspaper , claiming it failed to cover local events . They handed out bumper stickers  --  " The UnHartford Courant hurts Hartford "  --  and hanged Mr. Murphy in effigy . Likewise , Millard Pryor Jr. , president of Lydall Inc. , a large Manchester , Conn. - based materials manufacturer , says he told Times Mirror executives in private meetings that Mr. Murphy " wasn ' t involved with the community . " Phillip Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hispanic leaders made the same complaint . As a monopoly newspaper , the Courant ' s advertising revenue and circulation were shielded financially against the community ' s ire . Daily circulation dropped for a time by about 6 , 500 to 209 , 000 , but has increased since then to about 219 , 000 . Advertising has increased every year since the Times Mirror purchased the Courant . Still , Times Mirror was concerned about alienating the local community . So , in September 1983 , it demoted Mr. Murphy  --  who resigned immediately . Times Mirror next hired Michael Davies as the Courant ' s editor and chief executive officer from Capital Cities Communications Inc. ' s Kansas City Star Co. , where he was president and editor . Under his stewardship , the Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times shared a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of the 1981 Hyatt Regency Hotel disaster . Previously , when he was managing editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal , that paper won a Pulitzer for its coverage of a similar story , a deadly supper club fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Hartford chicken-dinner circuit , repairing the paper ' s tattered community ties . Walter Connolly Jr. , a Hartford-area resident and chairman of Bank of New England Corp. , calls Mr. Davies a " superb " spokesman . Ned Coll , who led picketers against Mr. Murphy , praises Mr. Davies ' s " positive attitude . " Mr. Davies , 41 years old , has reemphasized local news . He increased the Courant ' s news bureau staff from four to 14 in Enfield , Conn. , where the newspaper faces stiff competition from the Manchester ( Conn . ) Journal Inquirer . Marty Petty , the Courant ' s managing editor , claims she now runs three times as many local stories as did Mr. Murphy . Under Mr. Davies , the Courant has published stories alleging that state workers were negligent inspecting bridges and buildings , and regulating drugs used in greyhound racing . The paper has also closely examined the troubled Hartford school system . David Silverstone , a Hartford attorney active in utility cases , says that under Mr. Davies the Courant has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has " laid off the business community . " Some Courant reporters also sharply criticize Mr. Davies for courting local businessmen  --  a criticism derived in part from Mr. Davies ' s role as head of the Courant ' s news and business operations . As part of a Times Mirror promotion , for instance , he flew some local businessmen to the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles  --  a questionable action for an editor , but hardly unusual for a publisher . Mr. Davies also has reproached some reporters for their tough coverage of local businesses . Dick Polman , a former Courant columnist , says he quit partly because Mr. Davies didn ' t approve of Mr. Polman ' s columns chastising business leaders . " Davies sees a reflexive wisdom in what business leaders say and do , " Mr. Polman says . He adds : " He ' s on a crusade to rid newspapers of remnants of the ' 60s . " Mr. Davies derides Mr. Polman as " the original advocacy journalist , " adding that Mr. Polman couldn ' t stand to be criticized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a Sunday column , in May 1984 , apologizing for the " snide tone " of a news analysis of Hartford-based Coleco Industries Inc . Mr. Davies , comparing the Courant ' s coverage to Coleco ' s faulty Adam home computer , wrote : " The Courant , too , has had quality-control problems . " At least one-third of the news staff reacted with a petition , claiming that the column had a " chilling effect " on business coverage , and packed a heated meeting to discuss the matter . The column " was a signal to the staff to go easy on business , " claims Mr. Gunther , the former reporter . Mr. Davies attributes the newsroom reaction to a lack of a " tradition of self-criticism . " He adds : " Pointing out there were errors  --  why is that bad ? " A Coleco spokesman , who had protested the earlier coverage , says that since the column , the Courant is " more balanced and more equitable . " But Robert F. Murphy , who wrote the Coleco article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coverage of Coleco more tentative . " I have the subconscious feeling : ' The hell with it . Why pursue it ? ' " he says . But Mr. Davies has his defenders in the newsroom , too . Joel Lang , a Courant veteran who wrote an article critical of R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc. ' s Heublein subsidiary in Hartford , calls Mr. Davies a " hard-nosed journalist " who " won ' t let you get away with casual negativism regarding business or anything else for that matter . " Still , newsroom morale remains a problem . Andrew Kreig , a former Courant reporter who is writing a book about the paper , says that 105 reporters and editors  --  out of a total then of about 250  --  left in 1983 and 1984 . The exodus has largely ended , but the Courant lost experienced reporters who had developed valuable news sources . " The phones aren ' t ringing here enough , " says Tom Condon , a Courant columnist . He adds bitterly : " To survive here , you have to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t pay attention to who ' s running the government because every few years it ' s someone different .
