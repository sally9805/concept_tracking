NEW YORK  --  Chase Manhattan Bank Corp. lowered its prime lending rate to 10 1/2% from 11% yesterday in a move that signals lower consumer and business borrowing costs ahead . No other major bank followed the lead of the big commercial bank in lowering its base lending rate , although two small banks  --  Union Bank &; Trust Co . , Montgomery , Ala. , and First Federal Savings Bank of Boston  --  did trim their rates . Southwest Bank of St. Louis cut its prime fee to 10 1/2% on Friday . A reduction in the prime rate is likely to spill over into reduced rates on a broad variety of consumer and business loans . Many banks use the prime as a base to calculate between 40% and 50% of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate credit , including home mortgage loans . The nation ' s largest businesses aren ' t directly affected by the prime , because many can borrow at rates well below it . Bankers are often willing to provide these companies with sub-prime rate loans to keep them from turning to alternative sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign markets . Chase said its decision to lower the prime reflects a decline in its borrowing costs . The rate on three-month certificates of deposits , for example , has fallen to about 8. 6% from over 9. 1% a month ago , when the most recent prime-rate cut occurred . Based on these factors , " we decided that the appropriate rate for the prime is 10 1/2% , " a Chase spokesman said . Major banks previously cut their prime rates June 5 to 11% from 11 1/2% . Economists and money managers have been waiting for a prime-rate cut since it became clear late last week that the Federal Reserve was again loosening its grip on credit . The Fed cut rates Thursday , allowing the closely watched federal funds rate to drift to 9 1/4% . Prior to last week , the rate of federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , hovered around 9 1/2% . There is widespread speculation that the nation ' s central bank will cut rates again soon in an attempt to prevent the slowdown in the economy from deteriorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed Chase suggests that they are waiting for further easing by the Fed . " The Fed has made it clear that it wants federal funds at 9 1/4% , but some banks would prefer to have the rate at 9% before they make their move , " said Philip Braverman , executive director and chief economist at Irving Securities Inc . He believes that signal will come soon . " Chase will not be out there by itself for very long . The other banks will follow in a matter of days , " he added . The Fed can influence interest rates by adding or draining reserves from the banking system . It does that by buying and selling government securities through its open market desk in New York . The Fed drained reserves from the banking system yesterday . Despite that , the federal funds rate slipped to 9 1/8% , or slightly below what is perceived to be the new target of 9 1/4% .
