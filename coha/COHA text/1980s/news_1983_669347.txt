Over the left-hand pocket on his khaki shirt are the letters ERP-FMLN . The embroidery was done by his wife. // Ernesto is the guerrillas ' political commissar for Chirilagua . In his knapsack are a variety of pamphlets and other literature intended to entice people to join the rebels. // Two nights ago , Ernesto gathered town members to see a movie about the guerrilla coalition , the FMLN ( Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ) . He himself belongs to the ERP ( People ' s Revolutionary Army ) , one of the coalition ' s five member groups . The movie , filmed by a crew that travels with the guerrillas , included footage from recent military encounters. // After the film , the townspeople were invited to a dance . But few residents of the village felt comfortable enough with their occupiers to stay and socialize. // Despite these tensions , life in Chirilagua - as in most guerrilla-controlled zones in El Salvador - continues with a semblance of normality. // The town ' s local officials remain in office . The church choir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salvadorean government employees have arrived twice since the Sept. 26 takeover of Chirilagua to collect the water and electric bills. // The guerrillas soft-pedal their ideology here - preferring in town meetings to speak of the social injustices of the present government rather than the structure of the society they hope to create . They have not collected tribute payments and , with a few exceptions , appear to respect private property. // Any vehicle in the town can be commandeered by the guerrillas at any moment , however . And , although the vehicles are always returned , owners complain about rough treatment of their cars. // The guerrillas , as usual , have outlawed the use of alcohol in Chirilagua . When they first arrived in the town , they took all the bottles of liquor from the two bars and smashed them on the pavement. // ' ' We told the owners of the bars , ' ' Ernesto says , ' ' to sell something useful to the people , not a substance that helps blind them to the repression and injustice around them. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishable by execution. // In controlled zones , the guerrillas espouse a nominal pluralism . But their philosophy is heavily doused with Marxist analysis and calls for a ' ' workers ' state. ' ' // ' ' We fight because we are tired of being hungry , because we no longer want to live under the boot of the United States , the military , and the oligarchy , ' ' Ernesto says . ' ' We see them in luxury and our children without enough food . Of course we have an ideology , and that ideology includes a respect for Marx , but most guerrillas are not converted to the cause by ideas . They are converted by the murder of their families and friends , by the gross injustice that exists in El Salvador. // The guerrillas operate out of two large base camps in the north . The camps are heavily protected by mined roads , guerrilla patrols , and a communications system that includes the use of heavy field radios. // A patrol of 10 guerrillas , several of whom have walked all night from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hills . Three captured soldiers , who are treated with courtesy by the guerrillas , walk with us. // After a three-hour climb we arrive at a field . Laid out on the field is a crude obstacle course that includes simulated barbed-wire barricades . Here recruits , many of them as young as 12 or 13 years of age , train for combat. // In a meadow outside the rebel camp , captured Army soldiers , who have been assured they will not be harmed , are placed in the middle of the guerrilla ranks and marched into camp . It is standard for guerrillas to hold captured soldiers for several days and then release them. // El Salvador ' s Army generally refuses to reinduct troops who have been captured . Exposure to rebels , military leaders think , is reason enough to suspect soldiers may have become sympathetic to the guerrillas. // On a recent visit to Ernesto ' s guerrilla camp , the first structure encountered by several journalists was a thatched hut with three open sides . In the hut are stockpiles of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Approximately 20 men and three women lounge in the hut . Most wear green fatigues. // Here the prisoners are separated from us for questioning . We are escorted up a small rise to two bamboo houses that make up the propaganda center. // The entire camp , which is home for scores of guerrillas , is decentralized to minimize the damage and losses caused by aerial bombing . The camp consists of a series of small clusters of houses . These clusters include a field hospital , a central command post , and at least one large kitchen that prepares food en masse for the troops. // Several people , including a Belgian woman who has been with the guerrillas for a year , are silk-screening T-shirts with a portrait of a guerrilla crouched in a palm grove . Several dozen shirts are hanging on lines to dry. // In one hut are a mimeograph machine and stacks of paper . Here communiques and regulations for occupied towns are drawn up. // We are brought plates of beans , tortillas , and cheese . The cook speaks to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetorical and stiff. // The man we have been brought to visit is Rogelio Poncel , a Roman Catholic priest froM Belgium . Fr . Poncel has been with the guerrillas for three years . He runs the propaganda arm for the ERP . Poncel does not carry arms . He is soft spoken and his blond hair is combed straight back. // ' ' I have been in El Salvador since 1970 , ' ' he says . ' ' It got to the point where I had buried too many of my friends . . . to continue nonviolent resistance . When you look at the number of political and labor leaders who were murdered in the late 1970s , it is not hard to understand why the people decided it was time to fight back. ' ' // The return to Chirilagua is at night . Two armed guides give us flashlights and lead us up over razorback peaks . At the top of a ridge we look out over the milky glow of the Pacific Ocean . One guerrilla looks down at a flower folded up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers sleep , ' ' he says , ' ' something we can not do. ' ' // //
