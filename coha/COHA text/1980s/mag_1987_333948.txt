As Corazon Aquino agonized more than a year ago over whether to challenge Ferdinand Marcos for the presidency , she was closely observed by TIME Correspondent Sandra Burton , who was assigned to Manila . In the following account , Burton , who is writing a book on the Philippines , recalls how the future President made the toughest decision of her life . <P> During the week after Marcos ' announcement of snap elections , Cory was anxious and confused as she moved from one meeting to another . Though few knew it at the time , she was quietly undergoing a crash course in the art and issues of presidential campaigning under the tutelage of her brother Jose ( Peping ) and a selected group of advisers from business and academia . <P> One consultant , a communications specialist from the University of the Philippines , presented her one Friday morning with the findings of a voter survey just conducted in the Manila metropolitan area . He delivered a lengthy lecture , complete with columns of figures laboriously drawn on a blackboard . Impatiently , Cory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what people think now . " His conclusion : voter satisfaction with Marcos , which had plummeted shortly after her husband 's assassination , had gradually inched up to the point where 30% were for Marcos , 30% against and a high 40% undecided . <P> Far from being the political novice people liked to consider her , Cory was able to draw on the considerable knowledge and acumen she had absorbed during her years as the wife of Marcos ' chief rival . She quickly concluded that the figures were not as bad as they seemed . " Ninoy always said that the administration has a captive 30% , the opposition a stable 30% and that what elections are all about is how to bring over the 40% . " <P> Pointedly , she queried the professor about how to appeal to the undecided voters . " Do the people understand abstract things like truth , justice and freedom that I always talk about or do they only understand material things ? " The professor was evasive , so Cory described a trip she had made as chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The people welcomed me , but it was because I was bringing them a check , which meant rice for them , " she said frankly . " I have the impression that if elections are held , we are lost , because only Marcos can give them rice and pesos . " Then , restless at so much inconclusive talk , she excused herself to go to a nearby church for Mass . " If you have some answers , " she said curtly in parting , " please let us know . " <P> Prayer is an important element in Aquino 's daily life and decision making . After she has queried a variety of family members , technocrats and veteran politicians , she asks for divine guidance . Although waiting for inspiration may slow her down , it also produces resolute action once she makes up her mind . On this occasion , she felt she had exhausted the advice of others without finding an answer . Aquino says that when she entered the sanctuary , she " prayed as I had never prayed before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . ' "
