Last summer 's drought has produced not only a stunted harvest but also a toxic side effect : a bumper crop of aflatoxin , a fungus-based , cancer-causing corn contaminant . It has turned up in livestock feed corn ( although not the sweet corn so dear to the American palate ) in nine major corn-producing states . The Illinois Department of Agriculture says a third of the crop samples tested show aflatoxin above permissible levels . But by blending the current crop with grain from uncontaminated past harvests , the corn can be used . Moreover , the Food and Drug Administration has cleared the way for the use of even more contaminated grain ( for most farm animals other than dairy cows ) by raising the allowable level of aflatoxin from 20 to 100 parts per billion . <P> The contamination reduces what is expected to be the smallest per-acre corn harvest since 1970 . The U.S. corn crop is just 4.55 billion bushels , down 36% from last year .                @ @ @ @ @
