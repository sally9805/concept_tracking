Cavendish spent the years immediately after World War II in the Middle East , working in army intelligence . In July 1948 he steamed out of Port Said for Europe and , upon arriving , took a four-week vacation in Switzerland . He then returned to England , " clear in my own mind that what I wanted most was to carry on in the intelligence world . " He wanted to work in foreign intelligence and covert operations ? the work done in the British government by MI6 . As we pick up his memoir , he is about to be interviewed for just such a job . In September 1948 , I received the following letter from the ' Intelligence Co-ordination Staff ' : We understand you might be interested in government service involving periods of work abroad . We should he obliged if you would come for an interview at Princes Gate , SW7 . The interview was conducted in a large room . There were five men sitting around a long mahogany table . There was the chairman , Captain Frank Slocum , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yachts and fishing boats carrying agents into Europe ; there was Dick Brooman-White , formerly head of the MI6 station in Turkey and later a Member of Parliament ; and I believe there was Tony Milne , then deputy-head of the counter-intelligence and counter-subversive section of MI6 that had been founded by Kim Philby . ? I was asked mainly about my childhood in Switzerland and my service in the army . I was questioned about a family friend whom I had given as a reference , a senior officer of the Trades Union Congress . The interview lasted roughly an hour . No one told me what he did or the department he represented . I discovered later that others who had been interviewed had not realized that they were being considered for the Secret Service , and there were some who , once appointed , did not know that they had been recruited for intelligence work until they had completed a week or two in the Broadway Buildings in St James 's ? at that time , the headquarters of MI6 . I received another letter from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a language test . The test was conducted by a man in a dark , double-breasted blue suit ; he had highly polished black shoes and sleek brushed-down white hair . I later discovered that he was the Count Vanden Heuvel , who was , it turned out , the managing director of Eno 's Fruit Salts ; he was also a close friend of the current head of the Secret Service and had run its wartime operations in Switzerland . A few days later the ' Intelligence Co-ordination Staff ' wrote to me again : I had been offered employment as a junior officer , one who might have to serve from time to time overseas ; my starting salary was ? 400 per year . I was to report the next day . 1 signed the Official Secrets Act. * I had become a member of the Secret Intelligence Service , otherwise known as SIS or M16 or the Firm or the Friends . MI5 ? described us as the ' people across the park ' . The Chief was Sir Stewart Menzies , whom I never met but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages of the fourth floor , which housed the suites of the top three men in the Service . The other two were the Vice-Chief , Sir John Sinclair , and the Assistant Chief , Jack Easton . I reported to an establishment officer at 54 Broadway . There were different sections within MI6 . There was one that dealt with the air ministry , one with the admiralty , another with military information and the War Office . I was told I would work in R5 ? counter-espionage and information on subversion and communism ? and was then sent up to Maurice Oldfield 's room , where I finally realized an ambition I had nurtured since I first arrived in Cairo : to work with him again , this time in the most professional of British intelligence services . Shortly after joining , I was required in Germany , delaying my proper introduction : an eight-week training session in intelligence , known as ' General Trade Craft Course ' , held in an old building beside the Albert pub on Palace Street . There were twenty-four of us , divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given a box file , a ' diplomatic bag ' for our papers , that was stored overnight and regarded as inviolate .

I recall one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four days . On the last evening I went hack to our building in Palace Street and , on the pretence of having misplaced a valuable cigarette lighter , asked the security guard to let me into the building . I then went up to our lecture room , opened the cupboard containing the sacred boxes , and memorized the plans of the other five syndicates . On the last day , when the solutions to the problem were given , it was obvious that someone from our syndicate knew beforehand what the five other syndicates were planning , because we had a counter for each of their moves . It was obvious that somebody from our group had violated the secure box files . It was equally obvious it had been expected by the instructors . But a recruit from the Indian police force objected , stood up , white with anger , and said that this was ' not cricket , and he resigned ? no loss to a service prepared to go to any length to achieve its objectives . On completing the Craft Course , I returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Switzerland . Most of my job was desk work , but I was also involved with one of the first defectors from the Soviet Union : Grigori Tokaev , a brilliant aeronautical scientist in the Soviet air force , who was being kept in a safe house in the suburbs of London with his wife and daughter . He was obviously of enormous interest and value both to the air force and to our aeronautical design people , for this was at the time that the MiG-15 Soviet fighter was astounding Western aviation experts with its performance . It was also of value to have a senior Russian staff officer providing us with some understanding of Russian military methods and techniques . Once a week 1 drove down to the suburbs to see Tokaev , and we spent hours in his small drawing ' Gosport lies to the south . in the county of Hampshire , on the coot. room or in the nearby park , talking about his life in the Russian air force , senior officers he knew , their views , the way they thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet intelligence . I found Tokaev warm and friendly and , like most defectors , anxious to be seen to have more importance than he had in fact . That summer , I was to be posted to Germany , and I set off from Northolt Airfield near London and flew in an RAF Dakota to BUckeburg in West Germany . There was no mystery about the person who met me : he stood waiting beside a black Humber Super Snipe , one of the most powerful British cars at that time . I could never establish why the Secret Service in Germany had to be supplied with a fleet of those distinctive cars ; it did n't take long for anyone sufficiently interested to realize that , where there was a black Humber Super Snipe , the British Secret Service was at work . The driver who met me was called Harry , someone I would use later whenever I needed a big fast car . In Germany , my cover was as an officer of the Control Commission , and indeed nearly all SIS officers and secretaries had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small spa town not far from Bielefeld , ' and we were supported by outstations in Berlin , Hamburg , Hannover , Dusseldorf , and Frankfurt , and a one-man operation in Munich . There were an enormous number of SIS officers in Germany at the time ? probably fifty with a backup staff of a further 200 . Apart from the officers and secretaries , there were drivers , clerks , storemen , workshop men , batmen , safe-housekeepers , and the staff of the officers ' mess . Nobody really thought that our cover was very good . The next morning I was informed I would be working under ' Derek ' , second-in-command of the station ( whose vivacious wife 's main project appeared to be matching up secretaries and officers ) . My work , initially , included a range of tasks . During the first three months , I provided support for a number of agent-running operations ; I worked on an SIS evacuation plan ; I looked into the American-backed intelligence network of Reinhard Gehlen , a former German ' Bielefeld is about fifty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British zone of post-war Germany . 46 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE/DECEMBER 1988 general , that operated in the American zone , and did this ? an obviously delicate operation ? through one of General Gehien 's secretaries , recently recruited by the Service ( we always met ' romantically ' one hour after sunset on rotating days once a month , at one of three little Gasthauser ) . I looked into the League of Free Jurists , a group of West German lawyers that had been set up in 1949 to provide legal advice for people in the Soviet zone but that was also becoming an efficient intelligence machine . For the same reasons of intelligence gathering , I became interested in Radio Free Europe ; set up in 1949 as an anti-communist broadcasting service to the Soviet zone and the satellites , it had developed an information department that produced reports of great value to us . Later , I was given the uncomfortable task of investigating one of our own officers , whose name appeared in the diary of an East German call-girl who had been picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Democratic Party in Germany whose members remained in friendly contact with former comrades in the East . There were also emigre associations and various organizations for the exiles from the Ukraine and Poland and the Baltic states . In fact , I became quite familiar with the activities in the Baltic states , but I was first to learn of an operation about which , on the basis of the SIS 's ' need to know ' policy , I would have remained ignorant . I will call it PROJECT ONE : training and dropping SIS agents into the Soviet Union itself ' Bevin served as Foreign Secretary in Britain 's first majority Labour government , 1945-51 . War by the blockade surrounding Berlin , authorized the first major covert operation : a plan to foment a revolution in Albania that would overthrow the communist dictator Enver Hoxha . The plot was proposed by two agents , Billy MacLean and Julian Amery ( now a Conservative MP ) , who had been active in the military mission to Albania during the war and felt that one of their partisan contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring about a rising that would result in Albania becoming a non-communist thorn in the side of the mainly communist Balkans . The CIA became involved , and a joint SIS and CIA committee was established in Washington to co-ordinate the operation . Kim Philby was a member . However , while Philby could have informed his Soviet masters of the proposed action , it is also probable that insecure communication blew the operation . There were casualties and then more casualties , and finally , in the spring of 1950 , the whole large-scale operation was cancelled . It was the first major covert operation since the war , and it failed . Thereafter agents would travel only in teams of twos and threes . In fact I personally was asked to run one of the next operations , one that has been unrecorded in the Western histories of Europe . I was to be the MI6 liaison officer with the Royal Navy in Hamburg in an operation involving the covert landing of agents on the Latvian coast . During the war , the Germans had used their very fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . We recruited one of the most successful of the S-boat captains , Hans Helmut Klose , to carry out a similar operation for SIS , using one of the S-boats . The S208 , which had been built by Liirgens in Vegesack , was taken to a British yard near Portsmouth , stripped down , and then enhanced so that it could do almost fifty knots per hour . The cover for the operation was that Klose , his German crew , and the S208 were part of a fishery protection service run by the British Control Commission . The East Germans already had a border protection service . The men we recruited were quite young : they were , first , ideologically sound ; second , prepared to return to their homelands ; and , third , could complete successfully a training course that involved instruction in the use of weapons , explosives , radio , codes , cyphers , and secret inks . The training was done in Britain , following which the agents returned to an RAF airfield in Germany . In the meantime , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as locating suitable housing for the agents for the few days before their mission began , and I settled on a beautiful old house with overgrown grounds running down to the Elbe in the Blankenese district of the city . It was secluded , had a private drive , and a large loft that served as a communication centre where a team of wireless operators set up their communication links between SIS headquarters in London and Germany and with the S208 . We had a cook and a household staff drawn from SIS ancillaries . The agents arrived at Royal Air Force ' BUckeburg , led by their conducting officer , Peter . We used two fifteen-hundredweight Opel Blitz trucks with CCG numbers and an Opel saloon car . The agents came complete with their equipment , automatic weapons , ammunition , wireless sets , and , not least , their money belts filled with a ransom in gold coins . Peter and I debated whether it would be useful to have a trial run in the S208 ? we were worried that the three agents would start to brood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the end we agreed and took them down to the Elbe . Klose picked us up and took the S208 down the river , gradually going faster , but never doing more than about two-thirds of maximum speed . Even so , Klose was impressive and his crew 's handling of the boat superb . That evening we took the agents down to the Reeperbahn , the red-light district of Hamburg , to a little bar we had selected beforehand : it had an erotic floor show and its manager was an informant for the local Field Security Section . We were soon joined by four girls , each heavily made-up , and , as the serious drinking began , I headed back to the house where I was staying , only a stone 's throw from the safe house of our Baltic agents . At about three in the morning there was violent hanging on my front door : one of the radio operators stood outside asking me to come to the safe house immediately . Two of our agents had returned , but Peter and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation could he cancelled or that the trouble Peter and the joe ' were in might result in publicity or blow their cover . I got hold of the duty officer of the Control Commission 's Intelligence Division and met him at the nightclub , where it was clear there had been serious fighting . There was nothing he could have done , the manager told us , exceptcall the police . It was only because of my companion 's long-standing contacts with the local police that we were able to get Peter and the Latvian released into our custody . When we got back , I had to determine how much the two might have given away . And after a couple of hours going endlessly over every aspect of the evening 's events I was satisfied that neither the young tarts nor any of the other people in the bar would have learned anything more than that Peter was a drunken English businessman , with a friend who obviously was not English but who was a business colleague , I knew that if I reported Peter 's behaviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I decided to do nothing . I noticed that the two agents who returned on their own had grown reserved in their relations with Peter . Later I was to wonder how many times Kim Philby and George Blake* might have committed similar slips which , if reported by a colleague , might have put the service on its guard . Our intended departure next morning was delayed by bad weather . Following the fight the night before , there was tension in the safe house . I was relieved the next night when the Navy and Klose confirmed that the operation was on . We went down to the jetty at about 4 P.M , and loaded the kit and equipment aboard . I bade farewell to the party . Peter and I watched the S208 slide out towards open water , and we returned to the house to listen for its radio signals . From half-distance to the Latvian coast they were to keep radio silence and on their return only send a short success signal when they were well away from the Soviet-controlled coasts . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a signal that bad weather and a failure of the navigational gear had forced the 5208 to return . The next day , Klose and his men took advantage of what the forecasters promised would be a calm patch , and that night they completed a successful operation . In due course our agents came on air with their first contact . We did not know then that the operation had ' George Blake , an MI6 officer , was accused of spying for the Russians . He was tried and convicted in 1961 . Among the secrets he betrayed was the Berlin Tunnel Operation , a joint MI6/C/A undertaking in 1955 that established a tunnel into what was then the Russian sector of 48 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE/DECEMBER 1988 not in fact been a success . Many years later I heard through a friend in intelligence that all the agents dropped by the S208 , and later , by a second S-boat , were picked up by members of the KGB . Like most security lapses this one has been laid at Kim Philby 's door . It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East German television , that I thought of a different possibility . The film Rottenknechte ( Band of Knaves ) reenacts the whole of the S208 operation with East German actors taking the part of Mose , the agents , and even me . The re-enactment , however , is not devoted to just one operation . In the film we see the S208 edging its way along the beach , confident in the belief that no one not even the groups that have already landed or members of the Latvian resistance movement ? knows it is coming . Suddenly we see a Soviet reception committee waiting for the boat 's arrival . I am quite sure that while Kim Philby at his liaison post in Washington was privy to the general outline of our S208 operations , he would not have had detailed latitude and longitude positions for this landing , nor would he have had the exact timing . This therefore could point a finger at somebody else close to , or in , the operation . In later years , it always amazed me that these various operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I attributed this to the power of the Foreign Secretary at - 7-  that time , Ernest Bevin. ith the completion of this operation , I returned to headquarters and worked as a staff officer on various assignments until Derek told me that I was being posted to Berlin . I was delighted . Our social life was very gay in Berlin . 1 was delighted to discover that Claude Deshurst , whom I had first met in Cairo , was now in Berlin as a brigadier . He gave magnificent parties which , from time to time , got more than a little out of hand . Indeed , Claude called me one morning to warn me that one of his guests , who had been dancing in Claude 's fountain at a party , had had a photograph taken in a compromising position with a young German boy . Claude 's friend ? who was of use to us ? was anxious that the photographs should be retrieved before they damaged his civilian career . A hit of quick action on the part of one of our agents soon brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude . In retrospect , there were a substantial number of homosexuals at work in intelligence in Germany . Even so , it came as a bit of a shock when two of my colleagues suddenly disappeared : one to prison and the other out of the Service for being caught in flagrante with young German boys . It was , in these cases , impossible to hush up the matter ; but I will write later in the book of the position of gays ( as they are called today ) in the Secret Service . I was posted to Berlin , however , to take over the war-planning activity in that station , and war-planning was dictated mainly by the threat that Germany could be overrun by the Russians at any time . There were , therefore , caches of wireless sets , explosives , arms , and ammunition stashed throughout the country ? in the Soviet zones , the British zones , and in Berlin . They were usually hidden underground , but were sometimes placed in houses or barns or the specific places found secure by various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , a cache of wireless sets and codes that I decided was best hidden in the Grunewald . ' In the guise of a Royal Engineers Officer , I and a wireless specialist reconnoitred the area during the day ? dressed in civilian clothing , pretending to be having a picnic or bird-watching , depending on the weather . On locating a suitable site , we would draw its position on a large-scale map and return in the evening , under the cover of a military night exercise . he last weekend of May 1951 proved to be memorable . A brief phone call to my flat ? Tony , get over here ' ? summoned me to the Olympic Stadium which served as the headquarters of the British military and the main office of the SIS . I arrived and found all the officers of the Station assembling , and our Station Commander handing out photographs : they were of two British diplomats , Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess , who , it was believed , intended to defect and might pass through Berlin . Each of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-eight hours without sleep , we were all called off : the two had got through but not through Berlin . " A little later , I received a bitter blow . I was told to travel from Berlin down to the British zone : Big John wanted to see rne . Next morning I reported to John 's office and had to wait . When he arrived he asked me gruffly to sit down . He was sorry , he said , but he had some bad news . London had received a confidential The Grunewaid is a forested park in West Berlin . * Maclean and Burgess , two well-born Foreign Office diplomats working as double agents , made it to Moscow , even though British intelligence knew about their planned defection . It is generally believed that Kim Philby , the " Third Man , " tipped off Maclean and Burgess , enabling them to leave Britain and escape the tightening net . report about me after my first three years in the Service and had decided that I was not suitable to be confirmed as a long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derek , who had written that he was unable to make up his mind about me and thus felt that , if he could not himself be certain about my suitability , it would be wrong to give me the benefit of the doubt . It is ironic that some years later , when I left the Service , I learned that Derek had been a member of the Communist Party , had lied during his vetting procedure , and had been found out and sacked during an intensive shake-up of SIS when Sir Dick Goldsmith White took over as Chief lin 19561 . I demanded to see Commander Kenneth Cohen , the Chief Controller for Europe . I summarized my achievements ; he told me to return in twenty-four hours , and when I did , he announced that he was revoking the decision made on the basis of Derek 's report , that I would he posted to Vienna , and the future was up to me . After I arrived , there would he a new Station Commander ? Charles ' . That it would be Charles was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious fight over one of his pet agents known as Dandelion ' . ' Dandelion ' , one of our successful double agents , announced that his Russian case officer wanted him to move to South America ; if he was to continue with the Service , ' Dandelion ' asked to be provided with a new passport and a considerable amount of money . l and my colleagues in R5 at the time were convinced that ' Dandelion ' was a fraud , using us to pay for his resettlement . We opposed the project but we were eventually overruled by Jack Easton . A few months later , when ' Dandelion ' arrived in Venezuela , he gave the Station two fingers . Although I had been right , I was not endeared to the Vienna Station . It is equally ironic that in recent years I discovered that Charles , too , was a one-time member of the Communist Party . He kept a ghastly Pekinese that followed him everywhere and which he never succeeded in house-training . I was surprised that half of my colleagues were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before leaving for Vienna but had assumed I would be in the Embassy , although I knew there was currently no diplomatic slot available . All intelligence operatives are invariably obliged to have ' cover ' . Before World War Two , most British intelligence operations were grouped around the passport-control officer in the consulate ; MI6 officers now working in an embassy generally are there as first , second , or third secretaries or as attaches , and one or two senior posts ? the MI6 liaison officer in Washington , for instance ? rank as counsellor . At the end of the war a number of MI6 agents were sent abroad as journalists . Indeed , the Kemslev Press* allowed many of their foreign correspondents to co-operate with MI6 and even took on MI6 operatives as foreign correspondents . Other covers included businessmen or sales representatives . Hostile foreign intelligence services still treat most Britons or Americans residing in their countries as capable of being engaged in intelligence and watch them accordingly . Intelligence officers who used military cover normally took on the rank that best suited them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when I was in Germany , I worked with at least ten ' colonels ' . Having myself left the army as a captain , I reappeared , once required to use military cover in Berlin , as a major , with all the supporting documents signed where necessary by the GOC Berlin , General Sir Geoffrey ( later Lord ) Bourne . Soviet intelligence officers could be found among the members of Aeroflot , Intourist , the Moscow Narody bank , and merchant seamen , who , owing to the tolerance of immigration officers , are free to move in and out of Western countries at will , using bogus seamen 's papers . The most effective cover is probably provided by the Transport International Routier ( TIR ) agreement that , for trucks with sealed goods compartments , guarantees free and uninspected passage through all the countries that are signatories : virtually every country in Western Europe and the Soviet Bloc . Most of the trucks from behind the Iron Curtain have , at some point , carried a Soviet tank or artillery commander sent to obtain firsthand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war . These lorries have also been known to carry sophisticated electronic equipment that is conveyed across nonsensical routes passing military installations . In the event , I was told I was to be in the Intelligence Organization of the Austrian Control Commission as a Liaison Officer with the Embassy . A new S1S secretary was posted from London with an Intelligence Organization cover . My main assignment was to establish a war-planning system as I had done in Berlin and to run two agents : Edgar , who , working the main office of the Austrian Oil Company on the other side of the Danube at Zistersdorf , supplied information on economic developments , mainly related to Austrian oil production and its shipment to the East , and Hans , who supplied information on the Soviet army and air force . Hans was about thirty-five , blond , and blue-eyed , and a great , though almost obsessive , athlete . He strode around in leather knickerbockers , heavy ? The most important paper of the Kemsley Group in the years after the war was the Sunday Times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thick , white pullover : summer and winter , morning and evening . At the time , the Head Office had recently developed an automatic robot camera with a sight through the lens , which enabled agents to pan the camera on an aeroplane in flight , even when the camera was equipped with a 175mm telephoto lens . Our priority was to get clear photographs of the Russian MiG fighter plane , which flew over Vienna from time to time , although they were always so high that even a good telephoto lens could not give a satisfactory picture . The trick , therefore , was to take the photographs near a Russian airfield , and one of the main ones was at Wiener Neustadt about forty miles south of Vienna on the way to Graz and Klagenfurt . It was understandably dangerous to be caught loitering near a Soviet airfield ? especially with the camera we were using . Even so , it was in doing this that 1 met a number of important Russian officials and military personnel : each one of whom subsequently and mysteriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation , and so I took to spending Wednesday afternoons and Saturdays and sometimes Sundays in the country , ostensibly for the purpose of fishing . I had the special camera with me . Whenever I saw any MiGs I would lift the bonnet of my car and then , peering out from under it , would photograph whatever iv1iGs were in sight . In Melk I discovered a beer shop with seats on the terrace where Soviet officers gathered . Whenever a Soviet officer appeared , I would seek to engage him in conversation . I always used German . Eventually a young Russian artillery captain struck up a conversation with me which , in due course , led to a drinking competition . At the pub , there was a vast drinking glass holding two litres called a Stiefel , a riding boot . My Russian friend challenged me to drink a Stiefel of beer and a glass of vodka and he would do the same . Then we would repeat the process until one gave up , who would then he the loser . Eventually he grew rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We agreed to try again on another occasion , perhaps the Sunday after next . I knew only his first name and patronymic ? Grigori Vassilevitchnot enough to trace him on SIS records . A fortnight later 1 returned to Melk and was slightly surprised to see that Grigori was already there , sitting on his own . I drew up a chair and ordered a beer , a small one . Grigori told me he wanted to apologize for his behaviour the previous time we had met . We carried on talking , discussing everything ? families , home life , relations ? except matters of the Soviet military.completed one of their most successful operations , digging a long tunnel from a house in the British sector through to the point where they could tap into the telephone lines from Russian headquarters in Vienna to Red Army headquarters in St POlten , and from St POlten headquarters to Moscow . The whole Soviet order of battle , down to the whereabouts of this or that field bakery , was soon known to our Defence Intelligence Staffs . The operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel , caused it to collapse , with the tram sinking into the resulting depression . The matter was hushed up , but it was also the end of the operation . My social life at the time was taken up mainly by two young women working for the CIA , which did not please our Station Commander , Charles . In fact , there was little I did that did please him . I felt little affection for him , and I continued to find his ghastly Pekinese infuriating . Even so , 1 should have thought more of the fact that he would he writing the next report about me , except that I was so confident about the job I was doing . Late one night , returning from a party in the American sector , I skidded in the spring slush and knocked a cyclist off his hike . Charles decided this was irresponsible , and the irresponsibility unacceptable , and wrote a stinging report that caused me to be recalled to London .
