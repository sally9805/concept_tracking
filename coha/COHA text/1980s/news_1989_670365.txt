KAPIKULE , Turkey  --  Bulgaria ' s ethnic Turks have become the world ' s newest refugees . Hundreds of bedraggled men , women and children cross this border checkpoint with Bulgaria every daylight hour , most on foot and others in battered cars , lugging their household belongings . Most of the refugees say they were issued passports and exit visas without warning and told to leave the country within 24 or 48 hours . The Bulgarian government insists the Turks are not being deported but are simply " tourists " who have suddenly decided to go on holiday . " This is simply part of our new liberal passport policy , " a senior Bulgarian official has told Western reporters . Since early June , more than 125 , 000 such " tourists " have fled Bulgaria , and the one-way flow is increasing . Bulgarian officials have announced that 300 , 000 people may eventually leave . Fikre Ahmetoglu , a 41-year-old teacher , says that the police appeared at his door and handed him and his family passports . " They told us we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t , they take the passport back . They said we could not sell anything or take money out of the bank . " Those who decide to stay and protest the expulsions risk reprisals . Irfan Codilov , 25 , says he saw soldiers fire into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in the town of Prisstoe , wounding 17 . Others tell tales of beatings and of villages surrounded by tanks and soldiers with dogs . Ethnic Turks have been in Bulgaria ever since the Ottoman Empire sent colonists there after its Balkan conquests of the 15th century . While Bulgaria ' s communist rulers have always treated Turks as second-class citizens , the current expulsions appear to be motivated by concern about the Turks ' birth rate , which is higher than that of other Bulgarians . Estimates are that while Turks numbered less than 10% of the population in 1973 , today they number close to 15% , or 1. 5 million out of a total population of 10 million . In the 1950s and 1960s , Bulgarian leaders expelled 150 , 000 ethnic Turks in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then in 1983 , Bulgaria began a massive campaign of forced assimilation . Turks were given Slavic names and forced to follow Bulgarian customs . Schools and mosques were closed . " We had to wear two faces , " says Halil Gulistan , 52 , who spent five years in jail for teaching Turkish . " Inside our homes we were Moslems and outside Bulgarians . " Early this year , renewed protests against the assimilation campaign apparently convinced the government that it would not succeed . After decades of denying citizens the right to leave , Bulgaria in May started issuing Turks passports already stamped with exit visas . Far from being a sign of Bulgarian " glasnost , " the new policy is the legal pretext by which ethnic Turks are forced out of the country . Traffic jams clog the major border crossing at Kapikule , near the ancient Turkish city of Edirne . Refugees are often detained on the Bulgarian side by soldiers who paw through their belongings and help themselves to the valuables . In a holding area just inside Bulgaria , refugees unload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the country and onto makeshift carts and wagons , making heavily laden trips back and forth across the border . Some say they were ordered to leave by police , others that they left voluntarily to escape oppression . When an American journalist tries to question them further , he is firmly escorted back to Turkey by four border guards . Despite the number of refugees , international criticism of the expulsions has been muted . In part , this can be explained by the fact that Turkey has not had an unblemished human-rights record . But since returning to democracy in 1983 with the election of Turgut Ozal as prime minister , Turkey has made significant progress in curtailing human-rights abuses . Some leaders concede that problems remain . After Vehei Dincerler , a key member of the Turkish parliament , produces an Amnesty International report condemming Bulgaria ' s assimilation campaign , he is asked what he thinks of an Amnesty report criticizing the lack of Western legal procedures in Turkey . " Partly inaccurate , and partly accurate , " he replies . " But getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with American journalists at his home , Turkish Prime Minister Ozal said he believes Bulgaria has several reasons for expelling ethnic Turks at this time . A speech he gave in April saying Turkey would welcome any refugees may have prompted Bulgarian leaders to get rid of their most troublesome critics and at the same time claim credit for opening the border . They also may hope Turkey will be unable to cope with so many refugees and will close its own border , he said , allowing Bulgaria to claim a propaganda victory . " But I have called Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov ' s bluff , " Mr. Ozal said . " I opened the gates , and am prepared to take them all . " Still , Mr. Ozal would prefer to reach an agreement on an orderly exodus , and has asked the Soviet Union to pressure its normally servile Bulgarian allies . Soviet diplomats have had some discussions with the Sofia regime , but so far to no avail . Preparing for the worst , Mr. Ozal says he will gladly accept assistance from international groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exodus in Europe in 40 years . He also hopes Western countries will step up diplomatic pressure on Bulgaria to end its oppression of Turks who remain . Luckily , the majority of Bulgarian-Turks have relatives in Turkey with whom they can live temporarily . Only about 30 , 000 refugees currently are housed in tent cities near the border or elsewhere in Turkey . Before leaving his American visitors , Mr. Ozal solemly reads from a letter one tearful refugee gave him during the prime minister ' s tour of the Kapikule border station . " I am Salil Hani Hassan , " the man wrote . " My son has been taken hostage . The Bulgarians told me to ' Go to Turkey ' and leave everything behind . I had six cattle , seven goats and 13 sheep . Crying , I kissed their eyes and opened the door of the stable . I said , ' God has to care for you now . ' Prime Minister , please help us.
