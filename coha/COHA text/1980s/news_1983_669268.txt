This has been the slogan as well as the sentiment of women ' s activists as they reach for greater influence in the nation ' s lawmaking chambers. // Women comprise 51. 4 percent of the American population , and they are slowly but surely are coming into their own politically. // Yet despite considerable progress toward making their political presence known , it may be some time before the number of women lawmakers and policy-shapers approaches that of their male counterparts. // While declining to speculate how long it might take to reach parity , observers note that between 1975 and 1981 the number of women elected to offices in the United States increased from 5 , 765 to 16 , 552. // Such gains , which have escalated in most areas in the two years since the 1981 tally , are attributed largely to a greater awareness among women to their political under-representation. // Regardless of whether the number of women lawmakers eventually equals the number of men , the current trend can be expected to direct greater attention to women ' s issues , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Education Fund. // ' ' Women are coming to realize that politics is not something beyond them and that they can have a very positive impact on government , ' ' she observes // Others , including leaders of the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) , say that frustration over their inability to push the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) through male-dominated state legislatures has spurred much of the current push for more clout. // ' ' We ' ve gone a long way toward changing the image of women politicians ; now it is time to change the numbers , ' ' asserts Kathy Wilson , president of the National Women ' s Political Caucus ( NWPC ) . // The 1980 presidential election was the first time women voters outnumbered men voters , she notes . Mrs. Wilson says she anticipates that more and more women will run for office at all governmental levels in coming years. // ERA foes , such as conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly , say that too much credit is given the women ' s movement for enlivening interest in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been urging women all my life to participate in politics , ' ' she asserts. // In the last 10 years or so , women have been particularly successful winning seats in state legislatures and in municipal offices , observes Kathy Kleeman of the Center for the American Woman and Politics . The center ' s National Information Bank of Women in Public Office shows 1 , 051 federal or state elective seats now are filled by women. // These include : // // * Two US senators - Nancy Landon Kassebaum ( R ) of Kansas and Paula Hawkins ( R ) of Florida. // // * Twenty-one members of the US House of Representatives. // // * Thirty-seven statewide administrators , among them four lieutenant governors , 12 secretaries of state , and 10 state treasurers. // // * Nine hundred ninety-one state legislators. // The latter , an increase of 83 after the 1982 November election , is 13. 3 percent of the 7 , 438 state lawmaking seats. // Crrently , women hold at least one seat in all but three of the 99 state legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The state with the largest number of female lawmakers is New Hampshire with 121 - six in the 24-chair Senate and 115 in the 400-member House . Thus , 28. 5 percent of all Granite State legislators are female. // Ranking second is Colorado . One-fourth of the 100 lawmaking seats - five in the Senate and 20 in the House - are occupied by women. // Women ' s ranks also are growing among local elective offices . Seven percent of the nation ' s mayors and 10. 4 percent of all city councilors are female . A decade ago , by contrast , women held only 1 percent of the mayoral seats and 4 percent of the slots on local governing boards. // On local school boards , women held one-fifth of the elective seats in 1975 . Today they comprise more than a third of such posts. // Despite these gains on the municipal front , the number of women mayors in the 100 largest cities has shrunk from 10 to six in recent months . Jane Byrne lost to Harold Washington in Chicago , and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mayors of Austin , Texas ; Lincoln , Neb. ; and Oklahoma City all were succeeded by men. // A major goal of the National Women ' s Political Caucus is twofold : encouraging more women to run for office at all levels , and getting them elected , says Mrs. Wilson . She says municipal and state legislative seats are particularly good bases from which women can launch political careers. // The districts are relatively small , so the cost of campaigning is less than for governor or Congress , she says . Mrs. Wilson also suggests that raising campaign funds is often a major hurdle for women candidates. // She emphasizes that the women ' s movement is not a partisan issue and that the NWPC has encouraged women Democrats and Republicans alike to become active in politics at all levels. // Of the 991 women now serving in state legislatures , 585 are Democrats , 399 are Republican , six are nonpartisan , and one is an Independent. // Among the record 23 women members of Congress , Democrats hold a 12-to-11 edge . The Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow of former US Rep. Phillip Burton ( D ) , wins his Fifth District seat in the July 21 special election in California. // Currently none of the nation ' s 50 governors are women , but this could change in November if Kentucky ' s Democratic Lt. Gov . Martha Layne Collins bests former major-league baseball pitcher Jim Bunning , the Republican nominee . Only five women have ever held governorships , the most recent being the late Ella T. Grasso in Connecticut from 1974 to 1980 and Dixy Lee Ray in Washington state from 1976 to 1980. // Last November , two women - Democrats Roxanne Conlin in Iowa and Madeleine M. Kunin in Vermont - unsuccessfully sought governorships. // Particularly pleasing to women ' s activists is the increasing number of female appointees to key policy-shaping positions in government , explains Marilyn Nejelski of NWPC. // Several of the governors elected last fall have named more women than ever before to their cabinets and other key administration jobs , she reports . Massachusetts , New Mexico , Ohio , and Wisconsin are among the states that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started early in going after jobs with newly elected governors , ' ' she says. // At the federal level , President Reagan during his first two years in office appointed 63 women , or 9 percent of his 670 major posts . By contrast , President Carter in his first two years named 96 women - or 15 percent of all his nominees , according to the NWPC. // Currently , 76 women are serving on major posts in the Reagan administration . The appointments , although fewer than those of his predeccessor , are nearly triple the number named to federal posts by President Nixon between 1969 and 1974 . **22;21023; <> **42;21047; **42;21091; **42;21135; **42;21179; **42;21223; <> **76;21267; **48;21345; Women in public office <> <> **76;21395; **28;21473; <> **76;21503; **28;21581; **48;21611; Congress <> **48;21661; State <> <> **76;21711; **28;21789; **28;21819; **28;21849; **48;21879; legislatures <> <> **76;21929; **28;22007; **28;22037; **28;22067; % of total <> **28;22097; **28;22127; % of total <> <> **76;22157; **28;22235; **28;22265; Number <> **28;22295; members <> **28;22325; Number <> **28;22355; members <> <> **76;22385; <> <> **76;22463; <> 1969 <> **26;22541; 11 <> **26;22569; 2. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> 1971 <> **26;22731; 15 <> **26;22759; 2. 8 <> **26;22787; 344 <> **26;22815; 4. 5 <> <> **76;22843; <> 1973 <> **26;22921; 16 <> **26;22949; 3. 0 <> **26;22977; 424 <> **26;23005; 5. 6 <> <> **76;23033; <> 1975 <> **26;23111; 19 <> **26;23139; 3. 6 <> **26;23167; 604 <> **26;23195; 8. 0 <> <> **76;23223; <> 1977 <> **26;23301; 20 <> **26;23329; 3. 7 <> **26;23357; 688 <> **26;23385; 9. 1 <> <> **76;23413; <> 1979 <> **26;23491; 17 <> **26;23519; 3. 1 <> **26;23547; 770 <> **26;23575; 10. 3 <> <> **76;23603; <> 1981 <> **26;23681; 22 <> **26;23709; 4. 1 <> **26;23737; 908 <> **26;23765; 12. 1 <> <> **76;23793; <> 1983 <> **26;23871; 23 <> **26;23899; 4. 3 <> **26;23927; 991 <> **26;23955; 13. 3 <> <> <> <> <> National Information Bank of Women in Public Office// //
