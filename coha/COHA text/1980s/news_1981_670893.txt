Although he praised accomplishments of the last five years and promised better food supplies and more appealing consumer goods in the next five , the 75-year-old Prime Minister conceded in a major speech that " we have not entirely done away with the force of inertia and the traditions and habits left over from the period when the accent was placed not so much on quality as on quantity. " // " The party , " he said in an economic report to the 26th Congress of the Communist Party " sees difficulties and shortcomings . " <> <> Sharp Fall in U.S.-Soviet Trade // Mr. Tikhonov , long close to Leonid I. Brezhnev , the party leader and chief of state , also said that the Soviet Union would welcome an improvement in trade relations with the United States . Such trade dwindled rapidly after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan 14 months ago. // Figures published today showed that the trade turnover between the two countries dropped from $4. 48 billion in 1979 to only $1. 96 billion in 1980. // " It is not our fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Tikhonov declared . " That is a result of United States policy , which is designed to use trade for unseemly political ends foreign to equitable international cooperation. // " As far as the Soviet Union is concerned , we are prepared to develop economic relations with the United States as well on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. " // Mr. Tikhonov , who succeeded the ailing Aleksei N. Kosygin as Prime Minister in October , two months before Mr. Kosygin ' s death , did not mention the United States ' partial embargo on grain sales to the Soviet Union . During the Presidential campaign , President Reagan promised that he would lift the embargo . Since taking office , he has said he is restudying the issue. // Leonid M. Zamyatin , the senior Soviet spokesman , said at a news briefing this afternoon that Moscow was willing to negotiate a new grain agreement with the United States , separately or in connection with general trade talks . <> <> Trade Vital to Economic Growth // Mr. Tikhonov made no effort to conceal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West . Trade with capitalist countries , he said , " must , to a still greater degree , help meet the needs of the national economy for equipment , technologies and raw and other materials , as well as the demand for consumer goods. " // In his speech , Mr. Tikhonov followed closely the line set out Monday in Mr. Brezhnev ' s opening address to the congress and the draft guidelines for the 11th five-year plan , which will run from 1981-85 . The guidelines were published in December. // Mr. Tikhonov followed the guidelines so closely , in fact , that it appeared there had been no impact whatsoever from weeks of public meetings to discuss them - meetings in which no fewer than seven million citizens were officially said to have taken part . Asked to cite changes that had resulted from the discussions , Mr. Zamyatin looked uncomfortable , consulted his colleagues on the platform and finally replied : " We ' re not prepared to give you an answer right now . " <> <> More Work , Less Waste Urged // After five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Tikhonov , dour , gray haired and sharp featured , told the 5 , 002 delegates to the congress that " every hour of working time , every kilogram of raw material , every kilowatt-hour of energy and every invested ruble must serve our common cause. " // The renewed emphasis on efficiency was underlined in the figures for capital investments by the state . Between 1976 and 1980 , such investments rose by 29 percent . In the next five years , they are planned to grow by only 12 to 15 percent . The difference , it is hoped , will be made up by more productive use of new capacity. // The Prime Minister confirmed modest growth targets set in December for petroleum . Output of oil and gas condensate is to rise only 1 percent a year in each of the next five years , with a goal of 12. 4 to 12. 9 million barrels a day by 1985 . Output of natural gas , by contrast , is to rise at least 38 percent in the five-year period . <> <> Costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tikhonov said : " It must be borne in mind that maintaining , let alone increasing , the production of raw materials and fuel and power resources is costing more and more . We are having to move into less developed and remote areas of the north and east . The saving of every ton of oil , coal and metal is having an ever greater effect , and the damage caused by their irrational use is becoming more and more palpable. " // Commenting at a news conference on the energy situation , Nikolai I. Ryzhkov , first deputy chairman of Gosplan , the planning agency , said : " I can firmly state that we have never been importers of oil and are not going to be in the near future . " Taking into account the plans for saving fuel , we thought it possible to cut the rate of growth of oil production as compared to the previous five-year plan. " // One of the key elements in Mr. Tikhonov ' s report was a shift in emphasis from heavy to light industry in an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been an unchallengeable totem of Communist economic organization for decades , light industry is given a growth target - 27 to 29 percent - slightly higher than heavy industry - 26 to 28 percent. // The Prime Minister also promised to " increase the supply of meat , milk , fruit and other products to the population. " //
