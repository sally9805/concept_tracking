Despite United Nations  --  sponsored peace talks in Geneva and Moscow ' s apparent desire to pull out of Afghanistan , the realities of the Afghan conflict do not point to a settlement just around the corner. // For the British during the 19th and early 20th centuries , skirmishing with Afghan tribesmen or campaigning against czarist Russian ambitions in Central Asia was whimsically referred to as the ' ' great game. ' ' // But over the past eight years the war in Afghanistan has become a pitiless contest of endurance and basic survival - not just on the battlefields , but in the corridors of power . It is a war with too many players and too many interests. // // Based on recent conversations with Western and Asian analysts in London , Paris , and Geneva , a political solution to the conflict will depend not just on the two parties most concerned - the Soviet Union and the Afghan resistance - but also on Pakistan , Iran , the United States , China , and India . At present , the UN peace talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface , Afghanistan is the story of a Muslim people that rose up in revolt against a repressive minority government . The communist People ' s Democratic Party of Afghanistan ( PDPA ) , which first seized power during the so-called ' ' Saur ' ' ( April ) revolution of 1978 , initially sought to contend with the spreading insurgency on its own . But it soon became apparent that without large-scale Soviet military intervention , the regime of then-President Hafizullah Amin had little hope of surviving. // In the first three months of the invasion , some 85 , 000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the country , Amin was killed , and the Kremlin installed a puppet leader , the more pliable Babrak Karmal . It then set about trying to crush the resistance , which had spread to all 28 provinces , and to Sovietize the country . But the Soviet invasion added a new dimension to the conflict . For Afghanistan ' s largely peasant population , the fighting was no longer a civil war . It had become a nationalist partisan struggle , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north. // Today , Moscow ' s occupation force stands at between 115 , 000 and 120 , 000 , not including thousands of civilian advisers. // Analysts say Soviet strategy was , and still is , a long-term one . The Soviets have preferred to concentrate on wearing down popular resistance through a brutal war of attrition coupled with a ' ' divide and rule ' ' campaign. // NEVERTHELESS , the close proximity of the Soviet Union has given Soviet forces distinct logistical advantages . Supply routes across the Oxus River ( Amu Darya ) are short . Combat units and aircraft are regularly deployed in counterinsurgency operations from bases inside Soviet Central Asia . For all intents and purposes , the Kremlin considers Afghanistan an extension of the Soviet Union. // Most observers agree that a military solution to the war is unlikely . Since the invasion , both the Soviets and their Kabul surrogates , and the mujahideen , as Afghan resistance fighters are called , have steadily improved their capabilities . But neither side has succeeded in breaking what has become a stalemate. // Overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunship assaults , high-altitude bombing , and armored sweeps against mujahed strongholds . But they have also adopted more effective counterinsurgency tactics , such as commando ambushes against guerrilla caravans or expanded informer networks. // The guerrillas themselves admit that such tactics have made life more difficult . But numerous mujahed fronts have managed sufficiently to adapt their combat methods to keep the pressure on . Improved techniques and increased outside assistance , such as US-made Stinger missiles or long-range Chinese rockets , have significantly enhanced the guerrillas ' power . At present , the Soviets are believed by some Western observers to be losing one aircraft a day because of this improved antiaircraft weaponry . Recently returned observers have noted a rise in small , highly mobile attacks against urban centers , bases , convoys , and economic targets such as electricity pylons. // THE Soviets seem perfectly aware that their policies have failed to bring the resistance to heel . Even with the ravaging and depopulation of entire regions , the security forces can claim to hold only the capital , some towns , fortified bases , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling PDPA has made little headway in genuinely expanding its grass-roots support. // At present , the war is costing the Kremlin an estimated $3 billion a year . At least 25 , 000 Soviets have been killed and public concern is rising back home . Furthermore , the Soviets are said to be worried about their loss of prestige in the third world , notably among Muslim nations , because of the war. // Such factors are nudging the Soviets toward a political solution . Most West European analysts feel that Mikhail Gorbachev is sincere about wanting to pull out . The Soviet leader has referred to the war as a ' ' bleeding wound. ' ' // In the view of a British defense strategist , ' ' We , the West , and particularly the Americans , should do everything possible to help them leave . ' ' If a peaceful solution is really desired , he adds , Moscow should be allowed to extricate itself without losing face , an approach not generally appreciated by conservative circles in the US. // Pakistan and Afghanistan agree on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan , the resumption of relations between the two countries , and acceptance of assurances from the Soviet Union , the US , and China of Afghanistan ' s independence and nonalignment. // But they do not agree on a fourth crucial point : the timetable for withdrawal of Soviet troops . The Soviets who initially proposed a four-year timetable may have come down to two years or less , observers say , and the Pakistanis , who initally demanded four months , may have gone up to six months . US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has demanded a two-week timetable. // At the same time , most analysts believe the Kremlin is still seeking to retain its influence , if not control , in Afghanistan . As part of a withdrawal agreement , Moscow is insisting that all outside aid to the mujahideen be halted. // ' ' The Soviets are hoping that denying the guerrillas aid will give them enough time to neutralize resistance , broaden government support , and keep a pro-Moscow leadership in Kabul , ' ' says a Paris-based analyst . To this end , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more representative coalition administration. // At the start of this year , the party launched a ' ' national reconciliation ' ' program . Mohammad Najibullah , the former head of Khad ( the Afghan secret service ) who took over as Kabul ' s leader last May , said he was ready for ' ' compromise and dialogue . ' ' But he also stressed that he still considered the party ' ' guardian of political life and society in Afghanistan. ' ' // The Kabul initiative - which the guerrillas reject as propaganda - includes a unilateral six-month cease-fire , an appeal for refugees to return , and an amnesty for opponents who renounce their ' ' terrorist activities . ' ' So far , the government claims , 15 , 000 ex-guerrillas and 25 , 000 refugees have accepted. // Guerrilla leaders , however , are adamant that the Kabul proposal is little more than a ploy to make the resistance appear intransigent . ' ' What the communists are presenting is nothing new - just old words in a different form , ' ' contended one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' This so-called reconciliation program is dictated by Moscow and is aimed at legalizing Soviet domination . ' ' The guerrillas further maintain that they have no intention of dealing with Kabul . If there is any negotiating , they say , it will be directly with Moscow. // National reconciliation or not , the Soviets ' chances of retaining a pro-Moscow leadership once they have gone remain doubtful . Without Soviet military backing , observers maintain , the party has as little chance of standing on its own today as it did in 1980 . At best , according to most indications , the party can barely count on 5 percent of the population . And it is racked by internecine strife. // ALTHOUGH the drying up of outside aid may well hamper guerrilla activities , it will not bring resistance to a grinding halt . During the first three years of the occupation , most mujahed fronts received little or no foreign assistance , yet succeeded in tying down the Soviets . Concerned by a possible sellout in Geneva , guerrilla groups have been stockpiling weapons and ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to want a rapid political settlement . Though the Soviet invasion at first benefited the government of President Zia ul-Haq by transforming Pakistan into a ' ' front line ' ' state and brought it a dramatic increase in US aid , the Soviet invasion is becoming a liability. // The presence of 3. 2 million refugees on Pakistani territory is causing considerable friction among local inhabitants . Afghans compete for the same jobs and trade . The rise in the drug traffic from Afganistan has resulted in a serious increase in young Pakistani addicts , and guns from across the border have been used in local riots . In addition , Islamabad ' s policies toward Kabul have become a major bone of contention with left-wing political opponents , who are calling for recognition of the Kabul regime. // ' ' It ' s not that we don ' t sympathize with the plight of Afghans , ' ' a Pakistani businessman says . ' ' They are Muslims fighting for their freedom . But we just want to see them go home. ' ' // Any binding settlement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets and the mujahideen. // According to diplomats , the US as well as China and Iran has exhorted Pakistan not to accept a deal overly favorable to the Kremlin . The Chinese , who provide considerable support to the resistance , have also made it repeatedly clear that a normalization of relations between Moscow and Peking must include complete Soviet withdrawal. // The Soviets have been bringing their own pressure to bear on Islamabad through cross-border air raids and subversion . The Pakistanis are also painfully aware that any settlement unacceptable to the resistance could provoke an explosive reaction . The Islamabad authorities would find it no easy task to forcibly remove Afghans , many of whom are armed , from their territory. // ' ' We could easily face a new Lebanon , ' ' one Pakistani says. // //
