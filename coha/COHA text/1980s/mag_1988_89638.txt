Once upon a time there was a handsome , fair-haired boy who lived in Lustenau , a 1,100-year-old town in the Austrian province of Vorarlberg , not far from the borders of Switzerland , Germany and Liechtenstein . He dreamed that he would grow up and become a great ski racer for Austria  --  and he never had any doubts that this would happen . Once , when he was 12 years old , he met David Zwilling , the 1974 world champion in the downhill , and his father asked him if he wanted the champion 's autograph . " No , " said the boy . " I 'd rather wait until he asks me for my autograph . " // Today that boy is one of the two or three best ski racers in the world . He 's Marc Girardelli , 24 , the overall World Cup champion in 1985 and ' 86 , the ' 87 world champion in the combined event and an overwhelming favorite to be an Olympic champion in 1988 . The only thing about Girardelli 's boyhood dream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Austria but for the tiny , virtually mountainless Grand Duchy of Luxembourg . // Here 's how that absurd situation came to pass : When he was 11 , Marc was winning almost every skiing competition there was in his section of Austria  --  including , amazingly , ski jumping . Thus , he came to the Big Brotherly attention of Austrian ski officials , who more or less ordered him to attend a special boarding school for budding skiing superstars in Schruns , a town 30 miles from Lustenau . As Girardelli recalls , " My parents decided this was too far away , so I went to the normal school in Lustenau . I was still winning ski races , and it went against the ski federation 's grain that I could do this without attending its special school . This led to a lot of fighting between my parents and the federation . " // Marc 's father , Helmut , a former master embroiderer in the textile industry who now owns a hotel , is an intelligent , outspoken , hardheaded fellow who had a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory was that I quit racing at 18 , " he says ) . Of the fuss with the federation , Helmut says . " Because Marc was beating youngsters from the Schruns school there were fights . Finally , I said , ' O.K. , we do away with that . ' I did n't know anybody in Switzerland or anybody in Liechtenstein , where he also might have been welcome as a skier , so I went to Luxembourg , where I knew some people , including Aim Knepper , then president of the federation there . They took him in. " // This was 1976 . Marc was 12 . The duchy took him in as a racer , but not as a citizen . Thus , for the past eight years , the International Olympic Committee has considered Girardelli a man without a country . In ' 80 and ' 84 he was ineligible to compete in the Winter Games because his citizenship remained Austrian while his team affiliation was Luxembourgian . That changed last October , when Girardelli officially gave up his Austrian birthright . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and want to compete in the Olympic Games . I could only do so by becoming a citizen of Luxembourg . " // His talkative father puts a larger philosophical spin on the decision . " Citizenship is a piece of paper that is issued by a clerk , " says Helmut . " And I ca n't find any overwhelming euphoria in paper issued by a clerk . Among human beings the need to belong to a nation is the result of fear . People who are able to stand tall in life by themselves do n't need a herd of 100 million others around them . And it is usually the loners who change the course of things anyway . " // In fact , Marc 's decision to go it alone had as much to do with the unorthodox attitudes of the father as it did with any views the son might have held . For years the elder Girardelli had espoused revolutionary ideas about coaching and ski racing . He even tried to enroll in the Austrian Ski Federation 's coaching school to give his theories a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , but they would n't tell him when or where the courses were to be held . Offended , Helmut did not pursue the matter further . But ever since , he has exacted his revenge by retaining total control over the young man who is now Luxembourg 's only medal hope . // Helmut 's coaching ideas , which he could apply freely to Marc in his adopted country , turned out to be far ahead of their time . Marc describes them : " It took us 10 years to develop my personal technique , 10 years of thinking , learning , trying things out . We try to work according to the laws of physics  --  weighing the effects of friction , the application of energy , the results of certain forces . There are many variables  --  the psychological side plays a big role , too . " // And so has the medical side of Marc 's career . In 1984 , while competing at Lake Louise , near Calgary , in one of his first World Cup downhills , he took a disastrous fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left knee . He went to South Lake Tahoe , Calif. , where renowned knee surgeon Dr. Richard Steadman operated for 4 hours . Girardelli went home in a hinge brace to recuperate with a carefully designed program of exercises . Among other things , Steadman told Marc that when he decided to resume skiing , he could do so on one ski , on his right foot . Three and a half months after the operation Steadman received a photograph of a grinning Girardelli dutifully skiing on just one ski  --  but it was attached to his left leg with its freshly fixed knee . // Last year an old injury to Girardelli 's left shoulder turned the season into a nightmare . In 1981 the shoulder had popped out of the joint but quickly reset itself . It was dislocated again in the ' 82-83 season and became troublesome enough that Girardelli had surgery on it in the fall of ' 83 . Even that did n't make the shoulder completely stable , but it was not a critical problem until last season . // " In December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Girardelli says . " It made such a tremendous noise that my brother , who was sleeping in the same room , woke up . We tried to put it back in but were unable to . My father came and got it in again , but then I passed out because the pain was so terrific . " This continued to happen " maybe eight or 10 times . My father became very skilled at putting it back . The season began to seem like a catastrophe . " // The pain was so intense that Girardelli considered giving up skiing . Then he heard about Mohamed Khalifa , an Egyptian nerve specialist who lives near Salzburg , Austria . " Khalifa can feel the nerves with his thumbs . " says Girardelli . " When he treats me , it is as if he pulls a wire through my nerves . " The treatments worked miraculously  --  though briefly  --  for the 1987 world championships at Crans-Montana in Switzerland . Girardelli won the gold in the combined , plus silvers in the Super G and the giant slalom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season ( a GS in Sarajevo ) in March . But the pain and the popping out continued during his postseason training , so in late April , he went to Steadman once more . This time he underwent a five-hour operation to stabilize his shoulder . // Girardelli says he 's now without pain , and his skiing seems to indicate that . Though he had not won a World Cup race by early January , he had skied well in downhill training runs and had had good intermediate times in slalom races . As Calgary closes in , Girardelli and Switzerland 's Pirmin Zurbriggen ( page 46 ) are heading toward an across-the-board showdown . " Only Zurbriggen and I are in all events , " says Girardelli . " The others are specialists . " So , is there a chance that either you or Zurbriggen will win five gold medals ? " No . It 's the same for Zurbriggen as for me , " Girardelli replies . " One event always suffers when you are doing so many . " Is your goal to defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by doing better than ever before . Zurbriggen and I do n't know each other well . It 's difficult to have much of a liking for each other . " // Whatever happens at Calgary , Girardelli 's first Winter Games , the new citizen of Luxembourg is looking beyond ski racing . He 's planning to enroll in a university to study advanced physics . " I would like to become an astronaut. " he says , " but I am too old . At least they can find out what a man 's body can endure . " Many people think Girardelli has gone a long , long way toward doing that in his skiing career .
