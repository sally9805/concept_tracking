Outside these walls , however , Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ' s reforms have caught the Russian Orthodox Church in a swirl of change unprecedented in the 70 years it has endured Communist rule . So far , the Kremlin has : // *Allowed the church to engage in a year-long millennial celebration , launched last summer and just completed. // // *Televised pictures of a smiling Gorbachev assuring church leaders that the church could ' ' carry out its activity without any outside interference. ' ' // *Relaxed postal censorship , allowing thousands of Bibles and packets of religious literature to be mailed to Soviet citizens. // *Returned nearly 1 , 000 church buildings to the Russian Orthodox Church and authorized more than 1 , 600 new religious associations. // *Repealed a series of decrees that , contradicting constitutional guarantees of freedom of conscience , severely limited religious activity . The long-awaited move , announced by the State Council of Religious Affairs in early April , included removal of a 1929 ban on charitable work by religious organizations and a 1960 edict prohibiting bell ringing. // All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Theological Academy , has plunged the entire church into what he calls its own ' ' process of renewal , or perestroika. ' ' // Speaking in English in an interview with a group of American visitors , Archpriest Sorokin notes that ' ' this word ( perestroika ) means , for believers , that something changes in our situation , in our activity , and sometimes in our minds . It means that we must practice more-Christian views. ' ' // Dressed in the traditional robe and cross - and fiddling with a key-ring bearing the Russian words ' ' throne hall ' ' - Sorokin notes that one of the first challenges to this ' ' practice ' ' is to find enough priests. // ' ' In the Soviet Union we have three seminaries - Moscow , Odessa , and here . Together , we have about 300 students - 300 priests who will be ready for service . ' ' Despite a doubling in size in the last 10 years , that output will hardly be enough to staff the churches already returned and those expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , lies a deeper question : Is the church ready to move forward as rapidly as the social changes - especially the provision for reengaging in charitable work - would permit ? // ' ' Now we have the possibility to make more wide our activities in this field , ' ' says Sorokin . ' ' But it is going slowly , because we are - in religion especially , the same as in secular activities - a conservative people. ' ' // Over the decades of Communist rule , that conservatism was enforced by repression . Until perestroika , he says , ' ' it was possible to be a Christian , and to be a good man - but as a person , not as a member of the church or religious structure. ' ' // The result is that ' ' many believers are very quiet , very passive . ' ' Now ' ' everybody understands that this ( attitude ) is very bad , ' ' Sorokin says , and that ' ' we must do something , not sleep . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , we must go to the young people. ' ' // Sorokin himself , hardly a radical , is moving cautiously . He sees the church ' s role as ' ' not to be in contradiction but in coexistence ' ' with communism . ' ' Up until now , it was a platform of the Communist Party to be against religion . But now they change . They , too , want coexistence. ' ' // And that , he says , fits well with his church ' s 1 , 000-year history . ' ' Christianity is not a power of confrontation . Christianity is an element of transfiguration of the world - not the method of opposition , of contradiction . And especially for our country , for our situation. ' ' // After the 1917 revolution , he explains , ' ' the church made an attempt to be in opposition against the new government , against the new social structure . And it was a tragedy for us : We lost very many people , churches , books . The situation is more constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian element , the leaven. ' ' // One way to do this , he says , is gradually to reengage in charitable work - especially in hospitals . For years , he notes , that was nearly impossible : The state , forbidding religious charities , set itself up as the provider of everything needed by Soviet citizens , and doctors found it was ' ' not prestigious ' ' to welcome religious workers into hospitals. // Now shortages in hospital workers are increasingly being acknowledged . ' ' In my office today was the chairman of one of the great hospitals in Leningrad , saying , ' Please , take our hospital on your account and send us Christian people . ' ' ' He even offered to set aside a ' ' special place for prayer ' ' in the hospital. // Five years ago , says Sorokin , there could have been no such conversation with this man , who is a Communist . ' ' But now he asks me , ' Please , do something , because we are in a very difficult situation. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged to put about 40 volunteers into Leningrad hospitals - helping to feed patients , change linens , and talk to those who are lonely . If they find ' ' believers , ' ' they can arrange visits by priests. // Can the church find enough volunteers for this work ? As Sorokin points out , the very question of numbers is complicated . ' ' We don ' t count our believers - it is forbidden by state law , ' ' he says . Anyone can come to church , he explains , but individual churches don ' t have members in the tradition of Western congregations. // Yet the impulse toward Christianity , he feels , is strong and growing . ' ' I know that the majority of babies are baptized - about 80 percent of the population . And now we have many people who are adults who go to church and are baptized . ' ' He estimates that ' ' half the population of Leningrad , ' ' while not ' ' active ' ' in churchgoing , is religious. // The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach religion . So the central vehicle for religious instruction , he says , remains the preaching in churches. // He sees progress in using radio and television - where , after years of invisibility , churchmen can now appear dressed in their robes and wearing their crosses . At present , they are allowed ' ' only to answer questions from journalists . But in future I think there are possibilities to have our own time on radio and television. ' ' // //
