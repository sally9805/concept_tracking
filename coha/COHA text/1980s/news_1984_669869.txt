NEW YORK  --  In the latest underwriting sweepstakes , one investment bank stands out as surprisingly successful : Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . For the first six months of this year , Drexel placed third among U.S. underwriters of debt and equity offerings , according to Securities Data Co. , a data-research concern . That ' s a big jump from all of last year , when Drexel ranked sixth . And as recently as 1980 , Drexel was No. 14 on the underwriting scorecard . Through June , Drexel underwrote 42 offerings valued at $3. 46 billion , finishing behind only Salomon Brothers Inc. and First Boston Corp . Drexel ' s success comes from having carved out a niche by raising debt capital  --  so-called junk bonds for such lower-rated companies as Sunshine Mining Co . , Texas International Co . , Golden Nugget Inc. and MGM Grand Hotels Inc . Its present position also owes much to this year ' s dearth of equity offerings . Drexel Burnham " management recognized early that it wasn ' t to their advantage to wrestle ( for top-quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lipper Analytical Securities Corp . That recognition began after Frederick H. Joseph , Drexel ' s corporate finance chief , joined the company in 1974 . After a couple of years in which the department made little progress , he decided to move into what he saw as a gap in the market . Drexel pursued the scores of companies that the rating agencies classify as " speculative " with respect to their capacity to meet their obligations . For instance , Drexel looks at companies rated double-B or single-B by Standard &; Poor ' s Corp . In targeting this group in the mid-1970s , Drexel had one major asset : trader-salesman Michael Milken , who was a specialist in bonds issued by then low-rated conglomerates , such as Rapid-American Corp. and Gulf &; Western Industries Inc . Mr. Milken knew all the mutual-fund and bank buyers of " junk bonds , " which the purchasers like to call " high-yield " bonds . For many years , Mr. Milken ' s desk was considered the main secondary market for junk bonds . Mr. Joseph realized that Mr. Milken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such bonds as well . Since then , Drexel has built up its business steadily , although the real boom came only in the past couple of years . Recently , it hired away two investment bankers from Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , its nearest junk bond rival this year . " They ' ve tried to identify the people responsible for other firms ' penetration and neutralize them , " says one competitor . By Drexel ' s count , it underwrote 69% of all junk bonds during the first half , compared with 11% for Prudential-Bache . Drexel ' s corporate finance department now has 140 investment bankers . And Mr. Joseph said the department ' s revenue during the first half surpassed its revenue for all 1983 . The closely held concern wouldn ' t disclose specific figures . Still , Drexel ' s success involves risk . Underwriting lower-rated debt takes special skill to ensure that the companies are viable ones ; if care isn ' t taken , Drexel runs the risk of damaging its reputation among investors and opening itself to investor lawsuits . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " investigation of such companies may include hiring private detectives to scrutinize their business practices . Also , because these companies are below " investment grade , " investment bankers can ' t sell their securities to their usual customers at the pension funds and insurance companies . So they have to sell even more aggressively to other investors . Competitors call Mr. Joseph ' s corporate finance team " predatory " and " overbearing . " They don ' t mix much socially with more elite investment bankers . And they do seem to appeal to such entrepreneurs as T. Boone Pickens Jr. , chairman of Mesa Petroleum Co. ; financier Sir James Goldsmith , and Canada ' s Belzberg brothers , all of whom have enlisted Drexel ' s aid in controversial takeover maneuvers . Drexel insists that relatively few of its 424 clients have gone bankrupt . The firm stages so-called workouts for its troubled companies , replacing management or finding a merger partner . But Drexel hasn ' t escaped investor problems . In 1982 , it raised money for a Minneapolis air-charter company , Flight Transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its underwriters , alleging fraudulent accounting practices . The underwriters in turn sued the company , reaching a settlement that should give investors 95 cents on the dollar , according to Mr. Joseph . The company now is in bankruptcy proceedings .
