" I knew I 'd win a million , for some psychic reason , " said Chronic Loser Terry Garrett , 39 , a former heroin addict with a long arrest sheet . Sure enough , Garrett 's number came up in the million-dollar spin of the California lottery last month , guaranteeing him $40,000 a year for the next 20 years . ( The state withheld $200,000 for taxes . ) Garrett , however , did not predict the sorry sequel to his story . <P> His first $40,000 installment in hand , Garrett had to pay off fines and reimburse San Diego County for five years of welfare payments . Soon after , he was arrested in his newly purchased Buick Skylark along with two passengers , one of whom had just sold 8 oz. of cocaine to an undercover narcotics agent . Facing narcotics and firearm charges , Garrett must stand trial next month for allegedly stealing two bottles of cognac from a liquor store . The unlucky winner did manage to make bail by pledging $80,000 as security  --  from his future lottery payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
