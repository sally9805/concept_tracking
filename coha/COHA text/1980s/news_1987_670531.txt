The peasants in Nicaragua , who were forced to move to two Government camps there , and several other refugees who fled here early last month described abuses by the Nicaraguan Army during operations against American-backed guerrillas. // Sandinista officials acknowledge that the rebels , also known as contras , enjoy widespread popular support in southern Nicaragua . But a spokesman for the Sandinista army denied last week that it had abused human rights. // // Inaccessible Zone // The accounts shed light on Government actions in a remote jungle zone with almost no roads that has become one of the most bitterly contested areas of Nicaragua . It is an inaccessible area that journalists have been unable to enter , extending from the town of Nueva Guinea south to the San Juan River , which forms the border with Costa Rica , and east to the Caribbean coast. // The charges of serious human-rights abuses by the Nicaraguan Government are supported by two separate investigations carried out this year by two American human-rights groups , the Puebla Institute and Americas Watch . The Puebla Institute collected several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shootings , from Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica in January. // Americas Watch gathered reports of abuses in both southern Nicaragua and in refugee camps in Costa Rica . In a letter to the Nicaraguan Government in May , the group detailed more than 10 reported incidents involving the disappearance , shooting and wounding of unarmed civilians by Sandinista security forces. // Contras also appear to have been guilty of abuses in southern Nicaragua . They have killed several unarmed civilians during attacks on agricultural cooperatives guarded by Sandinista militiamen who fought the rebels. // In the border region , however , most reports implicate the Nicaraguan Army . Refugees in Government camps in Costa Rica and peasants interviewed two weeks ago in southern Nicaragua were unanimous in accusing the Sandinistas and not the rebels of human rights violations . Many , but not all , of the refugees and peasants said they supported the contras. // The Nicaraguan Army forcibly relocated almost 6 , 000 peasants from the area south of Nueva Guinea in April and May because they backed the contras , according to Sandinista officials . The officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a view that would appear likely to prejudice the lives of civilians remaining there. // During recent interviews by two reporters in the Boca Arenal and Alvaperal refugee camps maintained near here by the Costa Rican Government , 30 refugees accused the Nicaraguan Army of shootings and other abuses against civilians . The refugees fled southern Nicaragua in early May as part of a group of 106 peasants who swam across the San Juan River to Costa Rica. // " We left because President Ortega is doing us great harm , " said Jose Borge , a 45-year-old refugee who says he fled from the village of El Pavon in southern Nicaragua three months ago . " The Government has thrown the army at us . " He referred to the Nicaraguan President , Daniel Ortega Saavedra. // One of the worst incidents occurred in April , Mr. Borge said , when Sandinista soldiers opened fire on a group of refugees attempting to cross the San Juan River on the border . Mr. Borge , who was traveling with them , said the army killed seven peasants and wounded five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chico Sanchez , 35 years old ; Mr. Sanchez ' s 10-year-old daughter , Alejandra , and his son , Miguel Sanchez . Also killed , Mr. Borge said , were Chavela Giron ; Felipe Luna ; his son , Beto Luna , and his 4-year-old grandchild , Santos Luna. // The fleeing peasants , Mr. Borge said , carried their five wounded back to the Rio Indio inside Nicaragua , where they left them before retracing their steps to escape into Costa Rica by swimming across the San Juan River border . The second time , he said , they were accompanied by armed rebels who gave them protection. // According to the refugees , the villages of El Pavon , Agua Fria and 19th of July , to the south and east of Nueva Guinea , have all been especially hard hit by the Sandinista army over the last year . They said the areas around Punta Gorda and Rio Indio are also zones where civilians can not survive frequent bombing , strafing from helicopters and fighting. // " If a helicopter passes and sees you , they shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , a refugee who said she fled the Sandinista army in April from near Punta Gorda. // Several refugees said that they had tried to live by hiding in the mountains , but that they were constantly chased by Sandinista units and that there was no way to supply their most basic necessities. // " We live in the woods to avoid capture by the troops , but we were dying of hunger , without salt , clothes or work , " said Marina Riva Lopez , 49 years old , who fled with five children from south of El Rama in Zelaya Department. // In separate accounts , Mr. Borge and Eduardo Martinez , a refugee from near El Pavon , contended that more than 10 peasants were killed last December during heavy fighting near the village of El Delirio. // Peasants interviewed in Government relocation camps in southern Nicaragua two weeks ago told of a rape by a Nicaraguan soldier and the killing of three unarmed men by Government security agents late last year. // The refugees said they consider being captured and forced into Government camps equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derogatory slang term , " piricuaco , " or " piri " for short , which means rabid dog and is used by contra supporters. // Arnoldo Blandon Araujo , 55 , said he and his family fled the 19th of July village , which supported the rebels and is now abandoned , in February. // A Sandinista official said the contras had told the peasants to leave rather than be forcibly removed . Mr. Blandon gave his own version of why he fled. // " The reason is very simple , my friend , " he said . " The contras ran away and the piris came and laid waste. " //
