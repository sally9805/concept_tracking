NEW YORK  --  International Business Machines Corp. closed a small unit that sells analytical instruments , further cutting costs in anticipation of a tough year ahead . Separately , IBM cut prices as much as 15% for three more models in its Personal Computer family , only two weeks after it cut prices 42% for two other machines . The reductions probably clear the way for several new products expected from IBM early this year . The phase-out of IBM Instruments Inc. , which supplied laboratories with analytical measuring tools made by other vendors , follows IBM ' s move last week to close International MarketNet , an unsuccessful joint venture with Merrill Lynch &; Co. for providing stock-quote information to financial firms . The closing of IBM Instruments will result in only " minimal " charges to be taken in the 1986 fourth quarter , results of which are to be reported in about two weeks , a spokeswoman said . Wall Street analysts estimate that fourth-quarter net plunged 45% from year-ago net of $2. 68 billion , or $4. 36 a share , in part because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and other unspecified charges . David Hanna , a former 15-year IBM executive who now is a consultant in Menlo Park , Calif. , said he believes the IBM unit was barely profitable , or operating at a loss on annual sales of perhaps $100 million . " Because of IBM ' s severe profit crunch of the past two years , they ' ve decided in the past 120 days to get out of businesses that are losing money and are nonstrategic , " he said . He said IBM entered the instruments business in 1980 by taking a minority stake in closely held Bruker Instruments Inc. of Billerica , Mass. , and by later acquiring small stakes in five small , foreign concerns . Those stakes , IBM said yesterday , have been sold back to the companies ' shareholders ; IBM wouldn ' t elaborate . IBM said it formed the instruments unit in 1980 as a way to sell computers to analytical laboratories , but later found computer sales fared well without having to sell the instruments line . IBM had tried to sell the instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it may still try to sell some assets . The Danbury , Conn. - based unit employed 150 of IBM ' s more than 400 , 000 employees ; those workers will be offered jobs elsewhere in the company . While IBM wouldn ' t disclose the subsidiary ' s sales or profits , the unit ' s contribution is believed to be small compared with IBM ' s $50 billion-plus in annual revenue . In stepping up price cuts on personal computers , IBM is seen by many industry executives as clearing out inventory to prepare for the debut of several new machines early this year . IBM doesn ' t comment on new-product speculation , but is expected to introduce , as early as the current quarter , a new machine aimed at the low-priced consumer market ; a more-powerful version of its top-of-the-line PC AT ; and perhaps even its most-anticipated model , a new generation of computers based on the chip known as the 80386 from Intel Corp . The price reductions , which typically are passed on to customers by IBM ' s 2 , 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-megabyte hard disk , cut to $3 , 395 from $3 , 995 ; the PC AT model sold without a hard disk , also cut to $3 , 395 from $3 , 995 , and the PC XT that comes with a 20-megabyte drive holding as many as 10 , 000 pages of data , cut to $2 , 660 from $2 , 895 . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , IBM closed at $122. 875 a share , down 62. 5 cents . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
