Shake-up at the White House <P> When National Security Adviser Richard Allen announced just after Thanksgiving that he was taking an " administrative leave " from his White House job , the betting in Washington was that Allen 's leave-taking would be permanent . Now that estimation has proved to be correct . Allen had been under investigation by the Justice Department for accepting $1,000 and three watches from a Japanese magazine for helping to arrange an interview with Nancy Reagan , and for filing inaccurate financial disclosure statements . Even though the Justice inquiry cleared him of any crime , Administration officials still had doubts about his judgment , his effectiveness as the President 's top foreign-affairs adviser and the lasting impact of his brush with notoriety . As a result , President Reagan has decided to announce this week that Allen will not return to his job . <P> Allen 's successor is expected to be William P. Clark , 50 , who is now Deputy Secretary of State . Even more important , the post of National Security Adviser will be upgraded to give Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy among the Pentagon , the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency . Allen , who was subordinate to Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese , had neither . Says a senior presidential aide of the job 's new status : " We want to have a single focal point at the White House for State and Defense . Because of the personality problems , it did n't work out that way in the past . " <P> Personal antagonism , particularly between Allen and Secretary of State Alexander Haig , was only part of the trouble . In making good on his campaign pledge to reduce the importance of the National Security Adviser , Reagan went too far . The job is basically one of information manager , with the adviser and his staff sifting data and analyses produced by all the relevant agencies and recommending options to the President . But Allen 's lack of unescorted access to the Oval Office , his inability to manage the flow of paper smoothly and the shortcomings of his demoralized staff combined to make the council 's impact on foreign policy marginal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings with him a temperament and some personal connections that make him ideal for the job in ways that Allen was most troublesome . He has been a close friend of the President 's for years , and served as his chief of staff when Reagan was Governor of California . During Senate confirmation hearings for his State Department post , Clark showed an almost shocking ignorance of foreign affairs . ( He could not , for instance , name the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe , Robert Mugabe . ) But his sober and congenial performance at State has impressed his colleagues , particularly Haig . Clark is also a longtime friend of Meese and Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver , both of whom were his deputies during the California statehouse days .
