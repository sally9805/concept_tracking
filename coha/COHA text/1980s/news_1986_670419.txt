In more than six weeks of testimony from 23 witnesses , in person or through deposition , attorneys for the U.S.F.L. have tried to show a six-person jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan that the N.F.L. overtly and covertly took steps to destroy the young league by keeping it off the television networks in the fall and by undermining its ability to operate franchises in several large cities , including New York and Oakland , Calif. // During his presentation , Harvey Myerson , the lead attorney for the U.S.F.L. , has repeatedly shown the jury parts of a slide presentation entitled " U.S.F.L. vs . N.F.L. " that was given in February 1984 by a professor from the Harvard Business School , Dr. Michael Porter , at a seminar for 65 N.F.L. club executives . <> <> ' A Smoking Gun ' // In his opening statement to the jury in May , Myerson referred to the presentation as a " smoking gun , " telling the jury , " It ' s awful , awful hard to deny that you did something when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Pete Rozelle , the N.F.L. commissioner , and Jack Donlan , the executive director of the N.F.L. Management Council , testified that Myerson has misrepresented Dr. Porter ' s program , maintaining it was nothing more than one part of a larger seminar on contract negotiations , Myerson throughout the trial has referred to the presentation as " How to Conquer the U.S.F.L. " and has said that many of Dr. Porter ' s suggestions had been undertaken by the N.F.L. in what he called its attempts to destroy the U.S.F.L. // One witness after another was questioned about the tactics suggested in the Porter presentation : // * Attempt to dissuade ABC from continuing its contract with the U.S.F.L. // * Attempt to co-opt the most powerful and influential U.S.F.L. owners with promises of N.F.L. franchises. // * Attempt to bankrupt the weakest U.S.F.L. teams to reduce the U.S.F.L. ' s size and credibility. // * Sign current star N.F.L. players to contract extensions. // * Sign the best U.S.F.L. personnel to future contracts or determine if current contracts can be broken. // Myerson has hammered away the hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal sources of trouble for the U.S.F.L. have been its inability to get a television contract when it switched to a fall schedule for 1986 after three seasons of spring play and its inability to operate franchises in cities also occupied by N.F.L. teams. // Of those two , the television issue has been the more critical for the U.S.F.L. in that an expert witness , Dr. Nina Cornell , a Washington economist , told the jury that , by her analyses , the league was entitled to anywhere from $301 million to $565 million in damages - which would be tripled if it won the suit - based on losses she projected from the league ' s inability to play in the fall in its first season , 1983 . <> <> Control of Networks Alleged // Myerson has argued that because the N.F.L. had contracts with all three networks , rotated the Super Bowl game among them and could threaten them with a poor schedule of games if they failed to satisfy any whim or request , the league was able to exert pressure on - and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to elicit any " confessions " from the two senior network executives he called as witnesses - Roone Arledge of ABC and Neal Pilson of CBS - he put Howard Cosell on the stand to contradict Arledge and got Pilson to admit that he felt a degree of " pressure " from the N.F.L. during CBS ' s contract negotiations with the N.F.L. in 1982 . He also got a former executive of ABC Sports , Jim Spence , to say that the N.F.L. let it be known to him that it was " less than enamored " with ABC for giving the U.S.F.L. a contract for its spring schedule. // Myerson got something else of possible importance from Pilson : an explanation of a 1984 CBS survey undertaken at a time CBS was considering televising U.S.F.L. games in the fall of 1987 . According to Pilson , CBS determined that even if two networks carried the U.S.F.L. , as long as the N.F.L. was being shown by all three networks CBS would be unable to satisfy the financial needs of the U.S.F.L. in the fall. // That survey could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the effect of the N.F.L. ' s being on all three networks was that it was impossible for the U.S.F.L. to compete in the same marketplace. // Myerson has also tried to show that the N.F.L. was involved in two " conspiracies " : one in New York City designed to mislead city and state leaders into thinking that the N.F.L. would place a team in New York as a way to prevent a U.S.F.L. team from entering the city , the other in Oakland , designed to draw support away from the U.S.F.L. Invaders by making civic leaders there think they were high on the list for an N.F.L. expansion franchise. // In his attempts to prove these theories , Myerson elicited testimony from Senator Alfonse M. D ' Amato , Republican of New York ; Vincent Tese , the president of the state Urban Development Council ; Donald Trump , the New York developer and owner of the U.S.F.L. Generals , and Al Davis , the managing general partner of the Los Angeles Raiders , the only N.F.L. owner not named as a defendant in the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a friendly witness for the U.S.F.L. // Trump testified that Rozelle promised him an N.F.L. franchise if the U.S.F.L. remained a spring league and did not file an antitrust suit against the N.F.L. Rozelle has denied this . Davis characterized as " improper " a comment Rozelle made to Alfred Taubman , then the owner of the U.S.F.L. team in Michigan , that Taubman was " the type of person I think we would like to have in the N.F.L. " <> <> N.F.L. ' s Position // Throughout the U.S.F.L. ' s presentation , the N.F.L. , which began its defense yesterday , has tried to show the jury that , for all its charges , the U.S.F.L. has not shown any direct evidence that the N.F.L. enacted any of Dr. Porter ' s ideas or engaged in any anticompetitive behavior at all , for that matter. // With Frank Rothman of Los Angeles and Robert Fiske of New York as co-counsel , the N.F.L. has argued that the U.S.F.L. ' s losses of nearly $150 million in three years came about as a result of its own poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their cross-examinations that the U.S.F.L. ' s financial pinch came about as a result of the league ' s breach of its original spring contract with ABC ; its failure to field teams in Chicago , Los Angeles and other large markets ; a new group of owners , led by Trump , who pushed for the move to the fall , they say , as a way of forcing a merger with the N.F.L. , and a merger strategy designed to move U.S.F.L. teams from the larger markets into smaller cities that would be ripe for merger. // The N.F.L. ' s case could be helped by the fact that none of Myerson ' s witnesses testified that a " relevant market " exists for the U.S.F.L. in the fall. // Weeks from now , however , that might matter less than what the jury makes of Dr. Porter ' s presentation and what actions , if any , the N.F.L. took as a result of it . In his deposition , which was read into the trial record several weeks ago , Dr. Porter acknowledged that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury is convinced that it was a blueprint for destroying the U.S.F.L. , as Myerson has maintained , the net cost for retaining him could ultimately become quite a bit more. //
