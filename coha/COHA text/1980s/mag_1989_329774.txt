THEATER <P> BESIDE HERSELF . If you were an off-Broadway producer who had hired movie star William Hurt , would you cast him as a crude , subliterate UPS deliveryman who has little to do , and less to say , in a fantasy piece centered on a pathetic and prematurely old widow ? If so , you would disappoint audiences as keenly as New York City 's Circle Repertory is doing . <P> AUGUST SNOW . Novelist Reynolds Price proves a born playwright in a poignant trilogy ( the other plays : Night Dance , Better Days ) about thwarted hopes in a small North Carolina town ; superbly staged by the Cleveland Playhouse . <P> MASTERGATE . The President dozes away his afternoons . A paranoid National Security Adviser travels by Stealth bomber . The true head of Government is a secretive CIA director who also happens to be dead . Larry Gelbart 's fiercely funny Broadway satire lampoons events that made the evening news the sharpest comedy on TV . Joseph Daly is a dead-on George Bush , and the dialogue is an S.J. Perelmanesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samples : " I wonder if I might ask the Senator to stop raking over dead horses " ; " What did the President know , and does he have any idea that he knew it ? " The lesson of recent scandals is both less and more alarming . If the bums are not thrown out , it is because an overly forgiving , or morally inert , American people allows them to stay . <P> MOVIES <P> MY LEFT FOOT . Christy Brown was a poor lad who battled cerebral palsy to become a painter and author . Daniel Day-Lewis ' triumph is nearly as spectacular : to play Christy with a streak of fierce , black-Irish humor  --  and without a drop of TV-movie treacle . <P> THE BEAR . When it comes to technique , this wondrous movie is to other nature films what Star Wars was to science fiction : a redefinition of the state of the art . Even the most sophisticated filmgoers will be enchanted by this ursine tale , told from a bear 's point of view . <P> MUSIC <P> DANIEL LANOIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even those as skillful as Lanois ( U2 , Dylan ) , usually come up with eccentric gewgaws when they perform on their own . But here is an exception : Lanois ' music is minimal , mystical , folklike but decidedly unfolksy . No wonder he runs with the big boys . <P> MICHAEL BOLTON : SOUL PROVIDER ( Columbia ) . Singer-songwriter Bolton , a white rhythm-and-bluesman from New Haven , Conn. , finally hits his stride here . High point : Georgia on My Mind , on which his uncanny four-octave range and gut- wrenching phrasing give Ray Charles a serious run for the money . <P> MILES DAVIS : AURA ( Columbia ) . Miles used to play jazz  --  a melody with a beat . Now he 's into music whose electronically enhanced formlessness resembles nothing so much as the sound track of a space movie . That would be great if only we had the flick to go along with it . <P> ART <P> FRANCIS BACON , Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden , Washington . Haunting emblems of the Age of Anxiety in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently screaming figures . Through Jan. 7 . <P> MAKING THEIR MARK : WOMEN ARTISTS MOVE INTO THE MAINSTREAM 1970-85 , Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts , Philadelphia . These 87 artists have made their mark , but does n't categorizing them in such a show only perpetuate their separateness ? Through Dec. 31 . <P> BOOKS
