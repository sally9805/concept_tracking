It is New York ' s oldest enduring ethnic community , seemingly unchanging and insulated from the world around it . But Chinatown is being transformed . Suffused by the politics of Asia and the press of new immigrants , the Chinatown of tradition is losing ground to a Chinatown of new institutions and broadening expectations. // Less than two decades ago , contained by boundaries set at the turn of the century , Chinatown was filled with an almost homogeneous population from two counties in Guangdong Province . Today Chinatown bursts with the linguistic and cultural variegation of China ' s 21 provinces , as well as that of Chinese peoples scattered over all of east and Southeast Asia. // Chinatown has become a place where the ascendancy of China and the waning of Taiwan are graphically real ; where the reading scores of children are at the bottom half of the city ' s scores ; where tuberculosis rates soar far beyond those of the city around it ; where immigrants pay $5 , 000 in " key money " to get an apartment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinatown real estate. // The neighborhood has burst its traditional boundaries , spreading over southeastern Manhattan , moving into neighborhoods once solidly Jewish and Puerto Rican and all but smothering Little Italy , which is now but a two-block relic amid a jumble of Chinese dry-goods stores , vegetable stands and tea shops. // On Seward Park , the building that once housed The Jewish Daily Forward , the oldest Yiddish newspaper in New York , is now Chineseowned . The four-story walk-ups on Henry Street , two years ago predominantly Jewish , are now filled with Chinese immigrant families . And above Canal Street , plastic signboards dense with Chinese ideograms dot storefronts to Houston Street and beyond. // Satellite Chinatowns have sprouted in the Flushing section of Queens and in Brooklyn ' s Flatbush area , spurred by the failure of Chinatown to expand fast enough. // Perhaps 100 , 000 people - no one is quite sure how many - live in Chinatown . Its residents live in some of the oldest housing in the city and work at low-skilled , low-paying jobs . And , echoing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the neighborhood. // Yet Chinatown covets its cloistered inwardness , its preoccupation with concerns that carry no meaning elsewhere in New York . " It is the third world in New York , " as one of Chinatown ' s older men of power , Man Bun Lee , put it . <> <> Economy of Its Own // Chinatown has developed an economy of its own . Restaurants and garment factories long ago displaced the once-ubiquitous hand laundries as its pillars. // Throughout Chinatown there are about 500 garment factories employing nearly 20 , 000 people ; 95 percent are women , and virtually all are Chinese immigrants . Chinatown ' s streets , not only through the traditional core , but down East Broadway into the Lower East Side , up Elizabeth Street to Houston , are lined with more than 150 restaurants that offer an eclectic display of cuisines from China ' s provinces , together with such exotic amalgams as Sino-Burmese cooking . While the women work mostly in the garment factories , it is mostly the men who work in the restaurants. // Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant workers sought relief from miserable working conditions and low salaries through unionization. // There are , down its crooked streets , two Chinatowns - one a Chinatown of long working hours , English lessons and unionization ; the other a Chinatown of enduring family ties , unspoken loyalties and traditional institutions . <> <> Focus of Political Life // The first permanent Chinese resident of New York City , Quimpo Appo , a tea merchant who came in the late 1840 ' s or early 1850 ' s , was trailed quickly by others , including in 1869 , Chu Fung Wing , one of the founders of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association , an organization of 60 family and district associations that proceeded to dominate Chinatown for a century . The association determined who could do what business where , it settled disputes between merchants and it orchestrated the political life of Chinatown ' s residents . It also served as the principal contact point between Chinatown and City Hall. // On the fifth floor of the Lee Family Association at 41 Mott Street , Mr. Lee , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall lined with orange slips stained with vertical black rows of Chinese script . The slips record contributions to the Lee Family Association , totaling tens of thousands of dollars a year , by members and friends who wish to mark such auspicious occasions as the marriage of a daughter or the birthday of a parent. // " Our role has changed a lot , " reflected Mr. Lee . " Yes , it ' s true , our influence has diminished . " The admission does not come easily from the dean of one of the oldest and largest of Chinatown ' s 20 family associations , which once held sway over business in its quarter of Chinatown by controlling the purse strings of credit. // " Immigrants once used to come here to get a job , to get housing , " he said . " These new immigrants are much better educated than older Chinese . They don ' t rely too much on the family associations . " <> <> Mix of Savings and Gambling // Below a sixth-floor shrine to the ancient Chinese philosopher Laotse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was common in many parts of rural southern China during the 19th century . A functional mixture of savings and gambling , the club , called the San Yi Hui , operates alongside a federally chartered credit union and relies on the faith of its members in the permanence of tradition rather than the guarantees of the law. // While the members of the credit union tend to be of the younger generation , the older members of the Lee Association belong to the San Yi Hui . While saving $30 each week , participants can also win $1 , 800 in the complicated weekly Sunday-afternoon bidding. // That the family associations still carry financial weight in Chinatown , and sometimes occasion violent attempts for their control , is apparent from the fading scars on Mr. Lee ' s left hand . In 1977 , he fought off a knife-wielding attacker who , Mr. Lee said , was acting at the behest of someone who sought control of the association. // At the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association , Thomas Wong utters what is now a public litany . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second-floor office . " The organization is not that modernized , but it still has good influence . " <> <> Talk of Past Glories // For Mr. Wong and the association , though , past glories rather than present accomplishments dominate discussion . He speaks of closing garment factories and marching thousands of people to City Hall six years ago to protest the planned closing of the Fifth Precinct on Elizabeth Street or of a march several years ago to denounce police brutality. // " The C.C.B.A. only takes care of big issues , " Mr. Wong said . Now , he says , the association ' s main activity is running a school to teach the area ' s children to read and write Chinese . " Three thousand children , " Mr. Wong insisted , but the association has given the local Chinese papers the figure of 1 , 500 . The children , who span the first to the twelfth grades , come in the afternoon after their regular schooling. // The school , on the third and fourth floors of the association ' s blockish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calligraphy with the traditional ink brush . But down halls dominated by imposing busts of Chiang Kai-shek , the former leader of Taiwan and the political inspiration of the association , the school also seeks to inculcate the children with the virtues of Confucian morality. // " We tell them manners , how to respect the old , how to love the youngest , " said Linda Wu , who has been at the school since 1942 and is now its principal . In the classrooms , the ideograms so painstakingly traced by first graders are those used in Taiwan , not in mainland China . <> <> Animosity Between 2 Chinas // Today Chinatown is no longer the exclusive domain of the traditional associations . " Their control began to break down with the expulsion of Taiwan from the United Nations " in 1971 , explained Peter Kwong , an economist who teaches at the State University Center at Old Westbury , L.I. , and has written extensively about Chinatown . " A lot of people said that the future is China . Business people started shifting their commercial ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have a lot of Chinese coming to Chinatown who were born on the mainland - in Shanghai , Peking. " // The animosity between mainland China and Taiwan , the undertow in Chinatown ' s political life , has been played out for the past two years in the Hakka Association , a fraternal organization for ethnic Hakka Chinese , who come from southern China . This year the flag of mainland China was hoisted outside the association ' s offices at 1 Division Street to mark the election of an American President with sympathies for China - a symbol of the cracks in the old Chinatown order. // Ultimately , however , it is the inability of the traditional associations to cope with the flood of new immigrants that has altered Chinatown . The repeal of restrictive immigration laws in 1965 , and subsequent amendments in 1978 and 1979 , brought hundreds of thousands of Chinese to the United States . At least one-third of them have chosen to settle in New York City. // Newer institutions that sprang up during the flush years of Federal antipoverty financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses and provide the substantive assistance to immigrants that were not previously available in Chinatown . <> <> ' Atmosphere Has Changed ' // The most prominent of these agencies , the Chinatown Planning Council , operates entirely on city money and handles about 4 , 000 new clients each year . " Basically we ' re a social service organization . We offer day care , senior-citizen centers and manpower training , " said Harold Lui , who grew up in Chinatown and works for the council. // " From 1965 the Chinatown atmosphere has changed , linguistically , culturally , " he continued . " Immigrants used to come from rural areas , now they ' re from urban areas . Since 1965 , the whole situation has become more complex . With the large number of immigrants you have here you need a professional staff . The old associations can ' t do this , and they resent what our funding meant. " // " In the past they could control because they were the only linkage between Chinatown and the outside , " explained Charles Pei Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the only sources of contact anymore. " // In a new red-brick building on Baxter Street , the Chinatown Health Clinic , supported by Federal funds , is another of the social service agencies that have cropped up in the past decade . <> <> High Tuberculosis Rate // " This is a community in trouble , " said Dr. Arthur Chin , the 28-year-old executive director of the clinic . One area of immediate concern to Dr. Chin is Chinatown ' s tuberculosis rate . On the basis of the clinic ' s patient population , he estimates that the rate in Chinatown may run as high as 100 times the national average . " It is a dangerous problem , " he said . " TB is contagious , and many Chinatown residents live in very crowded housing . In densities like Chinatown , TB is easily communicated. // " There is limited access to health care . There are cultural barriers , language problems . " Chinatown ' s insulation has not shielded it from crime . Much of the crime , though , is sparked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality not unlike the organized extortion that fed on early Italian immigrant merchants at the turn of the century . But it is a subject shunned by the normally outspoken , one for which hushed whispers are reserved even by those less discreet in Chinatown. // Their heritage recorded only in a murky oral history , the gangs were founded earlier in this century as the muscle for Chinatown ' s tongs , originally adaptations of the 19th century secret societies in Guangdong Province and now nominally associations of businessmen. // The two principal tongs , the An Liang Shang Tsung Hui and the Hip Sing T ' ang , are widely known by residents and the police to control Chinatown ' s active gambling parlors . But the gangs , which often serve as protection for the parlors , have sought to escape the restrictive reins of the tongs . They have become more independent and have divided Chinatown into their own territories . Two gangs , the Ghost Shadows and the Flying Dragons , have parceled most of Chinatown between them . <> <> ' Paying Off ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not paying off , " said a reporter for Pei Mei Jih Pao , a Chinese daily . Paying off is shorthand for the gangs ' extortion of weekly protection money from the merchants. // " It ' s a fact of life , it ' s not a big deal , " added the reporter . Mott Street in Chinatown ' s core , a two-block stretch between Canal Street and Chatham Square , is controlled by the Ghost Shadows . Pell Street , which slices through Chinatown from east to west , is run by the Flying Dragons . " There is real territoriality , " said an assistant district attorney closely involved in gang cases . " The Dragons don ' t go on Mott , and the Shadows don ' t go on Pell. " // Gang violence stems almost always from disputes over territory and money . Sometimes , it is passers-by who are gunned down by the wild shots of warring gang members . When 23-year-old Alvin Chin , a student at Baruch College and a soldier in the now disbanded Black Eagles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of a rival gang , a bullet tore instead through the heart of Chin Lee Mei as her husband and two children stood nearby. // She was one of seven people killed in gang violence last year . This year , eight more people have been slain by gangs in Chinatown . Between extortion from merchants and protection payments by gambling parlors , each gang is thought to take in between $5 , 000 and $10 , 000 a week . Although each gang has no more than 30 to 40 hardcore members , there may be 150 young men with loose ties to a gang who perform services at the request of gang leaders . <> <> Big Business of Gambling // Gambling is big business in Chinatown . Ernest Eng should know . For two years , the 27-year-old undercover police officer has been setting up raids of gambling parlors throughout Chinatown . After nearly 50 raids , however , he has come to believe that there is a Sisyphean quality to his work. // " We ' ve seen cases where we bust a place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing to open it again , " he said . All of the 11 known gambling dens hidden away in Chinatown ' s basements , behind solid doors punctured only by peepholes , are blessed by the tongs , said Neil Mauriello , a detective assigned to the Chinatown gang task force in the District Attorney ' s office. // " To have a gambling house you need the sanction of the tongs , " the detective said . By being the sole source of loans to open a parlor , the tongs retain effective control of gambling activity , said Officer Eng. // The most common game played in Chinatown ' s gambling parlors is fan-tan , in which a cupful of small stones are spilled onto the table and counted off in fours after the players have bet on how many will remain . Other games include variations of poker as well as mah-jongg. // The illegal gambling houses have not sated Chinatown ' s passion for gambling . On a Wednesday last month , each of the eight Off-Track Betting windows at 18 Bowery averaged $5 , 152 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Station , the parlor that daily handles the greatest number of bettors in the city . <> <> Lawyer ' s Father Owned Laundry // In another part of the new Chinatown are people like Chester Wong , who now practices law in a small office on Division Street . He grew up in the Elizabeth Street tenements . His father owned a laundry and later gave that up to work as a cook in a Chinese restaurant . His mother still works in a garment factory. // " I have five brothers , and we were packed into a small room with bunk beds , " he said . " It was cold in the wintertime , because there wasn ' t any heat . The bathroom was in the hall . You know , I ' m surprised I didn ' t turn to crime. // " My parents worked hard for us to get an education . " Mr. Wong graduated from Brooklyn Law School and came back to Chinatown to practice. // " Since I had grown up in the community and had been active in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . But , he noted , " a lot of my friends moved out and went to work for big corporations . I don ' t argue against that . That ' s their choice. " // But Mr. Wong no longer lives in Chinatown . " I live in Riverdale . I ' ve had enough of poverty.
