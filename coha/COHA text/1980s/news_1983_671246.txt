But on this Monday , one of the hottest days of the sultry Washington summer so far , Senator Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana , was at an economic development conference in Great Falls . Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr . , Democrat of Delaware , was at a fund-raiser in Chicago . Senator Ernest F. Hollings , Democrat of South Carolina , was on the Presidential campaign trail , wooing voters in the state of Washington . And Senator Rudy Boschwitz , Republican of Minnesota , was in Minneapolis , taping a television show and appearing on a radio call-in program. // All together , according to a telephone check , 19 of the 100 Senators were either outside Washington or did not go to their offices today . It was , members of the Senate said , a rather typical Monday on Capitol Hill. // " It ' s not unusual , " said Senator Howard Metzenbaum , Democrat of Ohio . " On Mondays we very seldom have roll-call votes and , as a consequence , many are out campaigning or attending to personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s wrong . " <> <> Criticism by Goldwater // Historically , Senators have carefully guarded the traditions and folkways of Congress , not the least of which has been the custom of confining the major portion of the Senate ' s legislative work to the middle of the week . As a result , the " Tuesday-Thursday " week has become something of an institution . Senators frequently arrive in Washington late Monday or even Tuesday morning , and often depart after the completion of business on Thursday. // Last week , however , Senator Barry Goldwater , Republican of Arizona , took to the floor to criticize the way the Senate has come to operate. // " The Senate is now run , really , on a Tuesday to Thursday evening basis , with the weekends given over to those people who feel that they must be raising money for a campaign still over a year away or who feel that they must be home every weekend in order to keep their fences mended , " said Mr. Goldwater , one of the Senate ' s most respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think either excuse is valid. " // Senator Goldwater himself was not in Washington today ; he left to attend the funeral in Lockport , N.Y. , of former Representative William E. Miller , his running mate in his unsuccessful 1964 campaign for the White House . Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was ill and remained in New York . But the 19 others who found duties elsewhere knew late last week that they were , as a high Senate official put it , " safe " to remain outside Washington today . <> <> At Work in Wilmington // Their party leaders told them that the debate on abortion was scheduled for today but added that the roll-call vote on the amendment was not scheduled until Tuesday. // Thus Senator Alan Cranston of California , a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination , was free to conduct sessions with senior citizens and environmentalists in Boston and to schedule a fund-raiser in the evening . And Senator Russell B. Long , Democrat of Louisiana , could remain in his mountain cabin in Virginia. // At the same time , Senator William V. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Arlen Specter , Republican of Pennsylvania , delivered a speech in Hershey before the Pennsylvania Association of Boroughs , then visited a retraining program for steel workers . Senator Frank R. Lautenberg , Democrat of New Jersey , planned an appearance before the convention of the New Jersey Building and Trade Construction Council in Atlantic City and then the taping of a cable television program . And Senator Paul E. Tsongas , Democrat of Massachusetts , was returning from Greece , where he delivered the commencement address at the American College there. // Senator Walter D. Huddleston , Democrat of Kentucky , had one of the most active schedules . He was paid for a speech he made at the meeting of the North Carolina Coal Institute in Myrtle Beach , S.C. , then flew to New York City , where he had scheduled a fund-raiser for his re-election campaign. // " A lot of the members don ' t feel pressure to stay here around the clock , " said an aide to the Senate leadership . " When you get down to Thursday you find that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can ' t do anything . They ' re ready to leave . " <> <> Contact With Constituents // Most members of the Senate believe legislators ' work should not be confined to Washington . They contend , moreover , that they benefit substantially by speaking with their constituents and with local leaders . For example , Senator Alfonse M. D ' Amato , Republican of New York , gave a breakfast speech before the Rockland County Association and toured a detention center of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Brooklyn. // Last week , Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee , the Senate majority leader , urged that Senators curtail the time they spend in Washington . He suggested they spend more days in their home states and return to the " citizen-legislator " ideal envisoned by the Founding Fathers. // A number of legislators believe , however , that these attendance problems underline the need for an overhaul of the way the Senate conducts its affairs . " It ' s troubling that we do not attend to business here , " said Senator Dennis DeConcini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many of us live far from here , but many people rationalize not being here . We ' d serve ourselves much better if we had rules that set out attendance patterns . This is not an efficient body. " // Senator Goldwater , critical of what he described as the body ' s " bankers ' hours , " said Senators should begin work promptly on Monday morning , remain at it until Friday evening and work Saturdays if necessary . " The last time I tallied it up , we had been in session 155 days and 50 of them had been spent at work , " he said . " I can tell you as a former businessman my business would not have lasted 155 days if I tried to work in that manner. " //
