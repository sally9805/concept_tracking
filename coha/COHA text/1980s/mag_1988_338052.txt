Their criticisms of Attorney General Edwin Meese have been aired in the past month , but this time the two top Justice Department officials had an elite audience : Ronald Reagan and George Bush .

Weld , who had headed the criminal division , told Reagan what he had earlier told Meese : that he would indict the Attorney General if he were running the investigation . Meese 's friend E. Robert Wallach had profited from his relationship with the Attorney General , Weld said , and it appeared that Wallach had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his schemes . <P> The President asked no questions during the 30-minute meeting . Meese then gave Reagan his side of the story , presenting a rosier assessment , although John Shepherd , his nominee to replace Burns , had withdrawn his name just hours before .

No Republican , particularly not George Bush , wants to head into the November elections while Meese sits in the Justice Department offering a fat target for Democratic attacks . Reagan , unmoved by the accounts of the resigned Justice officials , bellowed a loud no when asked last week whether Meese should resign . But not even Reagan may be able to stand by his pal when later this spring Independent Counsel James McKay issues what will be at best a highly critical report on Meese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
