A grisly massacre of civilians <P> Even at the best of times driving a carmioneta-a pickup truck converted into a local bus-from the northern farming hamlet of San Jos de Bocay to the village of Jinotega , seven hours away , is a nerve-searing experience . The winding road runs through an area infiltrated by U.S.-supported contras who are waging a cat-and-mouse war along the Honduran border against Nicaragua 's Sandinista regime . Although there have been contra ambushes before , last week 's was particularly grisly . <P> Driver Jos Antonio Blandn , 28 , was concentrating on potholes when a band of perhaps 50 armed men suddenly appeared in front of his Chevrolet pickup . As Blandn and two others in the cab ducked under the dashboard , rifle shots rang out for what seemed to them to be several minutes . After the firing stopped , a contra peered into the cab . He ordered the three men to get out and , some minutes later , to carry two passengers , an injured woman and her six-month-old daughter , to a nearby house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . As the three shaken survivors hurried to report the attack , behind them ten civilians and one Sandinista soldier lay dead . <P> Nicaraguan officials were quick to claim that the contras had been responsible for similar massacres of civilians in the past . But one of Blandn 's friends had a different explanation . According to him , the Sandinista soldier had opened fire as soon as he saw the contras approaching , thereby provoking the savage reprisal . <P> One day after the massacre , three trucks slowly carried the coffins of four victims , draped with wreaths and national flags , from the trade union hall of Jinotega to the local church . At least 2,000 townspeople solemnly marched alongside . Their anger , however , was not reserved exclusively for the contras . Insisted Truck Driver Juan Ramn Hernandez , " It 's the army 's fault . They allow the soldiers to take these civilian buses . The contras know this and so they ambush them and innocent people are killed . " <P> A few hours after the ambush the contras struck again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure was said to be of limited strategic importance , its destruction was a symbolic warning that contras were living and working in the area . Taken together , the two assaults indicated that the relative lull that had followed the contras ' offensive last spring was over . In a feat of good timing , Junta Coordinator Daniel Ortega Saavedra appeared before parliament last week to propose a military draft that would make all men between 17 and 25 eligible for two full years of active service , followed by participation in the reserves until the age of 50.
