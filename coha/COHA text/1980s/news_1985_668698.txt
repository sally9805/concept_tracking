Commonwealth Edison Co. said its Braidwood and Byron nuclear power plants will cost at least $1. 2 billion more than previously expected and will face new delays of eight to nine months . Though Edison is not likely to petition the Illinois Commerce Commission , which establishes utility rates , for a new rate increase until the plants are in service , an Edison spokesman said the utility would seek to recover the increased costs from its 3 million rate-payers . Edison officials said Thursday that inflated construction costs and regulatory delays would increase the cost of the Braidwood units by $940 million , to $5. 05 billion , and would increase the cost of the Byron station by $281 million to $4. 65 billion . Last month , the commerce commission awarded Edison a rate increase of 14. 7 percent , or $494. 8 million , effective in two steps . The first step took effect this month , and the second step is expected to take effect in January , 1987 . For now , Edison ' s announcement ends speculation about the fate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would consider rescheduling or canceling them as part of a corporate austerity plan . " Our plan is to get the three remaining units in our construction program up and running as soon as possible , " said Edison President James O ' Connor . A spokesman added that " while the examination is continuing , preliminary results indicate that , with the latest changes , completing the units under construction . . . is still clearly the lowest-cost alternative . " The commerce commission in 1980 and 1982 supported completion of the plants and is again reviewing the matter . The announcement marked the eighth time Edison has increased cost projections and delayed in-service dates for the units at Braidwood , 20 miles southwest of Joliet . The two units are 90 and 60 percent complete , respectively . Regulatory delays and miscalculations of electricity demand have increased Braidwood ' s price tag from a 1973 estimate of $934 million . That is slightly less than the amount of the latest increase , which is the largest for the project . The station at Byron , near Rockford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects to place the Braidwood 1 and Byron 2 units in service on May 31 , 1987 ; until Thursday , the planned date was Oct. 1 , 1986 . Braidwood 2 ' s in-service date has been delayed to Sept. 30 , 1988 , from Dec. 31 , 1987 . Byron 1 entered service earlier this year . Representatives of consumer groups , which long have argued before the commerce commission that the Braidwood project should be scrapped , said Edison ' s announcement supports their argument . " It would not be credible to suggest ( Edison ) will not call additional delays , " said Douglas Cassel Jr. , an attorney for Business and Professional People for the Public Interest . " A $900 million increase for Braidwood is a credibility-blowing increment . That ' s just staggering . " Others , such as Sue Stewart , executive director of the Citizens Utility Board , interpreted Edison ' s announcement to mean that the utility is farther behind in the projects than it has disclosed . Yet Edison spokesman Bob Dwyer said people who intervened in commerce commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwittingly caused delays by repeatedly requesting information and investigations . " Manpower that would be spent running construction at the stations is being spent answering questions , " he said . Edison officials also said the company is considering converting its Collins power plant , near Downstate Morris , to coal or gas power to cut costs after nuclear construction has been completed . Two units of the five- generator , oil-fired plant were engineered to burn coal also . The company ' s board of directors approved a $5. 2 billion construction budget , effective 1986 through 1990 , to cover maintenance and construction costs for its plants . The new budget is $150 million lower than the 1985-1989 budget , reflecting the fact that Edison ' s nuclear-construction program , begun in 1960 , is nearing an end . Officials also are studying other ways to cut costs . In October , Edison said it would freeze the 1986 salaries of several thousand management-level employees , and froze its 1986 operating budget at the 1985 level , $1. 19 billion . Also Thursday , the commerce commission denied four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those requests were submitted by Edison , which was awarded $87 million less than it had requested ; the City of Chicago ; the Labor Coalition on Public Utilities ; and the South Austin Coalition Community Council.
