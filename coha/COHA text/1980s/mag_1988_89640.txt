Next month when Canadian racers pass through the gates at the top of the Olympic downhill course at Mount Allan , ghosts will be riding their skis with them . The Crazy Canucks are retired now , but the spirit that won them the name lives on . Drawing on their legacy , this year 's Canadian skiers will take the biggest risks and , of course , face the greatest dangers among the Olympic downhillers. // In 1975-76 , after four young Canadian daredevils  --  Ken Read , Dave Murray , Dave Irwin and Steve Podborski  --  broke the European stranglehold on the downhill , a Swiss journalist called them the Crazy Canucks , and the name stuck . In a sense the four were crazy . Each thought he was good enough to win a World Cup downhill , though no North American male had ever come close , and each took horrifying chances in a sport that punishes even small errors in big ways . That all of them lived long enough to retire in their mid-to late-20 's is nothing short of miraculous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where rivalries among the five Alpine skiing nations  --  Austria , Switzerland , France , Italy and West Germany  --  are fierce , the Canadians were the second favorites wherever they went . They were young , friendly as a litter of cocker spaniel pups and so brave they took your breath away . The four blazed a trail for later non-European daredevils like Bill Johnson of the U.S. , who won the Olympic downhill gold medal in Sarajevo in 1984. // From 1975 to ' 82 the Crazy Canucks together were the equal of the best of the European teams . They won 14 World Cup downhill races , and Podborski , the youngest of the group , also won the World Cup overall championship in ' 82 and got a bronze medal at the Lake Placid Olympics in " 80. // That was quite an accomplishment considering that until the Crazy Canucks came along , the downhill was the last bastion of European chauvinism in men 's Alpine skiing . In fact , at the moment of their arrival , it was the personal property of Austria 's Franz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Herbert Plank of Italy . // The Canadian breakthrough came at Val d'Isre in the French Alps in the first event of the 1975-76 World Cup season . Klammer fell and was eliminated , and Ken Read , then 20 and fresh out of Calgary , beat Plank and Russi by more than half a second . That win made Read  --  whose mother . Dee , was the Canadian women 's downhill and combined champion in 1948  --  the first North American and the first non-European-trained skier to win a men 's World Cup downhill . What really rocked Europe , however , was that four Canadians finished among the top 10 in that race . // " They could n't believe we could do it , " says Podborski , who was 18 then and finished 10th . " They knew we could n't ski better than the Europeans , and they knew we could n't possibly have better equipment , so we had to be doing crazy things . And we were . We were learning , taking chances where nobody else would or could . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while we were right , and we 'd get that 10th of a second and we 'd win . It was an adventure the whole way . " // Two weeks later , when Irwin won the downhill at Schladming , Austria , it became apparent that the Crazy Canucks had some depth . Irwin , who grew up at his family 's ski resort in Thunder Bay , Ont. , had made the Canadian team on the basis of his slalom skiing . But when the coach , Scotty Henderson , decided in 1974 to emphasize the downhill , at the expense of the slalom and giant slalom , Irwin successfully switched events . // " The Canadian team did n't have enough money or enough coaches to have both slalom skiers and downhill skiers , " says Irwin , now 33 . " And the team wanted to get to the top quickly . It takes years to get to the top in slalom , but in downhill you can do it quickly . " // Irwin 's first World Cup victory was also his last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more because of them than he did , and two weeks after his victory at Schladming , as he was on the verge of becoming one of the world 's best down-hillers , Irwin took the first of four bad falls , at Wengen , Switzerland . Cartwheeling at more than 60 mph. he wound up with a broken rib , a badly cut face and , worst of all , a severe concussion , from which he has never fully recovered . " He ended up just getting battered from one end to the other , " says Murray . // Murray , 34 , is now director of skiing at Whistler Mountain in British Columbia , where he grew up . He started racing late  --  at 15  --  and was the only one of the Crazy Canucks who never won a World Cup downhill . " Murray was the most intellectual of the group , " says Patrick Lang , a Swiss skiing writer . " In my opinion that was why he never won . He was a Crazy Canuck , but maybe he was not crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training runs by two seconds , but on race day he could n't do it . Ken Read won . " // " It 's a very subtle sport , " says Murray , the red hair that once flowed from under his racing helmet was now cut short . " The difference between first and second can be many different things . It can be a wind that blew in your face , or a wax , or you slid your tails just the slightest bit on a turn , or you stood up a little high . " // Or you can be shaped wrong . Murray was more angular than his teammates , and his shoulders were a bit broader . The ideal downhiller is , like Irwin , pear-shaped , hugely muscled in the butt and thighs to better absorb the shocks of traversing the bumpy hillside at high speed , and , like Read , slight in the shoulders and upper arms to slice through the wall of onrushing air . " I have the theory that Ken 's body is the most aerodynamic of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him , he has narrower shoulders and a really rounded back . That 's what you need at speeds of , say , 70 or 80 miles per hour . He would slip through the air much more easily . I 'd always be working to get my shoulders crunched in tight . " // Read , now 32 and an Olympic skiing commentator for CBC , won five World Cup downhills between 1975 and ' 80 . He won a sixth , at Morzine , France , in ' 79 , but was later disqualified when his newfangled racing suit was ruled illegal because it did n't meet the FIS 's permeability standard . " Ken 's main attribute was that he was completely and overwhelmingly dedicated to the sport , and he would go absolutely nuts out on the course , " says Murray . " And although technically I would n't put him in the same class with Steve Podborski , he made up for it in sheer bravado . I mean , everybody was trying his hardest , but somehow Ken would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won at Schladming in December 1978 , Charlie Kahr , the Austrian coach known as Downhill Charlie , said , " Ken Read skied faster than he could ski . " // Read 's best year was 1980 , when he won back-to-back downhills at Kitzbhel and Wengen . He was a favorite going into the downhill at the Lake Placid Olympics , but 15 seconds into the race one of his skis came off . Podborski , however , earned the bronze , which made him the only Canadian Olympic medalist in a men 's Alpine event . // Podborski , the most successful of the Canucks , grew up in Don Mills , a suburb of Toronto , where the highest hills are only 500 feet . " I should never have been a ski racer , especially not a downhiller , " he says . Pod made his way through local and regional competitions and at 15 was invited to the national team 's summer camp at Whistler Mountain . After winning a race or two there , he was invited to attend a team selection camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the slalom and not too bad in the giant slalom , and they put me on the team , " says Podborski . " It was a miracle . There I was , on the national team at 16 . I was totally ignorant . When I first got to the World Cup races I did n't know why there were fences around the course . I 'd never raced where they needed to keep people back . " // After two top 10 finishes in his first World Cup season . Podborski wrecked a knee 10 days before the 1976 Olympics at Innsbruck . " Two of the four major ligaments were totally ruptured , " he says . " The thing was , I 'd never been hurt in my life . I was 18 years old , and I 'd just blown the Olympics . They sent me home to get my knee operated on . and I got to the hospital on a Sunday . On Monday my parents , who did n't know I was hurt , arrived in Innsbruck to watch me ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was devastating . I went into the depths of depression . One day I was alone with the dog , and I just lay in bed and stared at the ceiling . I made up my mind I would never again go over to Europe knowing I had n't trained as much as I could . " // Podborski 's first victory was a tainted one . When Read was disqualified at Morzine because of his illegal racing suit , Podborski , who had finished second , was awarded the win . downhills that year and came close to winning the overall downhill championship . The next year he won three more downhills and did get the overall title . He retired in ' 84. // " The Crazy Canucks were a miracle , " says Podborski , now 30 . " It was like having a hockey team from Barbados winning the Stanley Cup . We started with absolutely nothing . We were really a rinky-dink little team  --  the mouse that roared . It was four guys that were together , doing things to beat the Europeans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the second skier down , say , and I would be the 15th . He would come to a stop , rush over and call me on the radio to tell me how to do the course better , not only so I could beat the Europeans , but also to possibly beat him . As far as each of us was concerned , it was us against them , not me against the world . " // The Crazy Canucks did n't just happen out of the blue . They had a prototype to work from : ( Jungle ) Jim Hunter , the son of a Saskatchewan dairy farmer . Hunter started out as a hockey player , but at age 12 changed course and , by dint of three years ' hard labor and unbelievable gall , made the national ski team at 15 . It was a few years before the Canucks joined him on the circuit . // " Jim was the best on the team when we came along , " says Irwin . " He was incredibly strong . I remember watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before the race , and he did 100 one-arm push-ups . He was like that . He always had to show off . He loved attention . He remained a little separate from the team , but we learned a lot from him . " // " The guy was an absolute maniac for training , " says Podborski . " He would never ever back off . He won a giant slalom run at the ' 72 Olympics , but he fell on the second run . He just could n't put two runs together . He could n't quite win . That 's one of the things about the sport  --  it 's just not fair . " // Todd Brooker was n't actually a Crazy Canuck . He arrived on the scene a bit late to be a full member of the Crazies . But Brooker caught the spirit . He retired last March after three World Cup wins , nine knee operations and a final fall of Canuckian dimensions at Kitzbhel in 1987 . " I learned to enjoy skiing the way they enjoyed skiing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I took a lot of falls , because that 's the way I like to remember the downhill , as risky and challenging . " // Brooker 's fall at Kitzbhel was the kind people talk about for years . Back home in Canada . TV stations replayed it again and again for a week . " When you watch a downhiller skiing under control , it does n't look that tough , " says Murray . " But you see this person suddenly lose control at 85 or 90 miles per hour , and what can happen to him , and you realize that possibility is there every second of the way down the hill . " // The era of the Crazy Canucks is over now , but the image fashioned for themselves by Read , Irwin , Murray and Podborski lives on in the downhillers who will race in Calgary  --  guys like Rob Boyd , Brian Stemmle and Felix Belczyk . " The Canadians know they better go fast or they do n't deserve to have helmets on , " says Andy Mill , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that image . They 're proud of falling . "
