As a rule , anything that is titled Collected Stories suggests a summing up or a retrospective , a big book that gathers the contents of earlier , slimmer ones . Such volumes tend to be tributes to writers and testaments to their careers rather than displays of new works or directions . And that would certainly appear to be the case with Wright Morris ' Collected Stories , 1948-1986 . Morris is , after all , one of the most distinguished and honored living American men of letters , author of 19 novels ( including Love Among the Cannibals and The World in the Attic ) , five books of his own photographs and texts , four collections of essays and three volumes of memoirs . <P> Surely Morris , 76 , deserves to be honored with an assembly of his short fiction ? Indeed he does , the only teeny little catch being that the author 's extensive bibliography includes just one book of stories , Real Losses , Imaginary Gains ( 1976 ) . Yet more has gone on here than gathering the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collected Stories , 14 have never before been published between hard covers , and eleven of these were written during the past six years . <P> So what is being offered is preponderantly a brand-new book , more than half-filled with stories that Morris ' most dedicated readers may have missed when the pieces first appeared in periodicals . Also on view is the prospect of an author in his eighth decade of working at the top of his form , burnishing a reputation that was securely polished long ago . <P> On the evidence presented here , there is no such thing as a typical Wright Morris story . Unlike contemporaries like John Cheever and Eudora Welty , Morris has not devoted the bulk of his attention to a particular social class or geographic area . His principal characters may be anything from janitors to college professors , and his settings range from Vienna to Brooklyn to Missouri to Northern California , with numerous points in between . The common thread in Morris ' stories , both early and late , is an odd , intense vision of life after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages , husbands and wives coexist in uneasy truces , wondering whether their remaining energies will run in tandem or blow each other apart . <P> In The Cat in the Picture , for example , a retired Army officer and his wife have settled into what seems to be a peaceful and stable routine . He dabbles at painting ; she reads and turns out occasional book reviews . One rainy night , a stray cat drops through the skylight in the captain 's studio and moves in with them , apparently for good . The next morning , seeing the animal in a bowl that forms part of a still life her husband has arranged , the wife says , " If you could paint that  --  that would be a picture . " The remark is not intended in entire innocence ; it opens what turns out to be a protracted and vicious domestic war .
