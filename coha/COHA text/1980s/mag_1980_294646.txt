DRESSED TO KILL Directed and Written by Brian De Palma <P> A shower stall . An attractive , restless blond , whose search for sexual fulfillment will lead her to an ominous rented room . A man , whose schizophrenic lust turns him into a knife-wielding killer in a cheap wig and dress . <P> These gimmicks could provide the basis for a great horror movie . In fact , they have : Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho . But Brian De Palma seems to have been inspired by his first youthful look at Psycho the way other teen-agers are affected by a helpful teacher or a first kiss : he has built his obsession into a career . De Palma 's last seven films , from Sisters in 1973 to the current Dressed to Kill , have been informed by Hitchcock 's work until some of them begin to look like remakes . Dressed to Kill is the most explicit of these homages : that shower ( in a Long Island home instead of in the Bates Motel ) , those blonds ( Angie Dickinson and Nancy Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transvestite killer ( Mr. X instead of Anthony Perkins ) , plus a prowl through a museum , lifted from Vertigo , and a sound-effects trick from The 39 Steps . But De Palma has done it before , and , in Sisters and Carrie , he did it with compassion and an agreeably gross wit . <P> The characters in Dressed to Kill are not candidates for compassion or figures of raunchy fun . They are animated mannequins-the wandering housewife ( Dickinson ) , the loving son ( Keith Gordon ) , the harried hooker ( Allen ) , the patient psychiatrist ( Michael Caine ) - whose only function is to attack or be attacked , to play villain or victim . The plot has so many coincidences and contradictions that the moviegoer is left with only one option : to savor Dressed to Kill as an exercise in directorial style . <P> Of all film genres , the thriller is the most dependent on directorial technique . Using camera tracks , point-of-view shots and disorienting cuts , the director can reveal or conceal , lead and mislead the viewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virgin in an old dark house . De Palma knows all about this . His camera glides down corridors and through rooms as elegantly as a downhill racer with murder on his mind . His actors of ten move at an otherworldly pace that recalls the stylized slowness of silent movies-especially in a wordless sequence that lasts almost half an hour . He builds suspense through the use of the unsuspected detail : a hand picking up a glove , a gleaming doorknob , an empty pair of shoes . <P> Some of these pyrotechnics fizzle , and all of them operate in a narrative void . One reason Psycho continues to disturb is that Screenwriter Joseph Stefano gave Norman Bates and his hapless victims some emotional resonance . Even if you never screamed while watching Psycho , you could appreciate it for the sense it gave of seemingly ordinary people drawn into a swamp of frustrations and aggressions . De Palma 's movies no longer explore these tensions ; they have become exhibitions of a master puppeteer pulling high-tension strings . In Dressed to Kill , the marionettes on-screen still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially those who hoped that De Palma would become the heir to Hitchcock 's throne rather than the scavenger of his vaults . - By Richard Corliss
