THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IT 'S Dawn Bingo at six o'clock on the upper West Side : in one of the dark , gloomy silhouetted tenements , there is visible from the sidewalk a single yellow rectangle ; a few flights above , another rectangle appears ; then , across the street , a third one . The bingo boards fill up . A wet , bitter wind spits moisture on one 's face , then freezes it . A gray pigeon is walking stiffly . A solitary human being huddles at a bus stop , peering up the avenue . The bus arrives  --  big , noisy , well-lit  --  scoops up the traveller , and grinds away , leaving the grim backdrop against which the person had stood : an empty lot guarded by a chain-link fence ; dirty snow ; ratty pennants trembling on a cord slung from a store to the bus-stop sign . A young man and a young woman cross the avenue carrying two briefcases and one red snow shovel . Climb into car parked on side street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whine ; crunch ; roar ; screech . They drive away , with snow shovel , passing a tall , gaunt man with a cane who is lurching down the street stabbing at the ice : an N. C. Wyeth pirate ( except for his ski jacket ) delivering a Black Spot . On the avenue , a cat wails . Not a cat . What is it A rooster . A rooster ? Then a tremulous humming sound comes from within a sealed-up grocery . Up the block , light from a store illuminates abright assembly of gum-hall machines on the sidewalk , and inside there 's a **52;6854;TOOLONG ( and much , much more ) in operation . Aged glossies of hit players are taped to the walls , and half a dozen customers  --  black , white , Hispanic  --  are seated at the counter . It 's warm , and full of pleasant sounds : jingle of change ; door squeaking open and shut ; water filling a coffeepot ; knife , having sliced through a corn muffin , dropped on cutting board ; jangle of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked " KEEP Our " and separates behind-the-counter and the cash register from everywhere else , and sounds a gentle alarm when the proprietor walks through ; an array of coughs and seasonal snortings ; the snap of matches being struck , and the less crisp sound of lighters ; conversations bubbling in Spanish . There 's the smell of coffee , cigarettes . Woman behind the lunch counter has serene , lovely face , works steadily , smoothly : anus in striped sweater reach this way , that ; a roll is buttered ; coffee is poured ; lid is put on container ; container is lowered into brown paper hag . The proprietor , a tall , solemn-looking man who might be sixty or seventy , stands at the cash register . " It 's cold below and it 's cold above , " he declares in a mournful bass voice , rolling out the words . An elderly acquaintance who is seated at the counter turns to theproprietor and says , " I 'm going home and eat hominy grits . " Proprietor says , " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're good for me . " Proprietor says , " They make you sexy . " Acquaintance says , " That 's what I want to he . " He departs . " Three more days ! " exclaims a man in work boots . " Until what ? " says the man next to him . " Until the weekend , " says the first man . He puts some sugar in his coffee and stirs it . " I 'm keeping track of weekends , " he explains . A young man with a blue backpack dashes in , asks the proprietor for change  --  eight quarters . He takes the change over to the greeting-card section , where there is a postage-stamp machine . A few moments later , he is seen licking stamps and putting them on red envelopes ; then he darts out . The place is filling up with people now ; the sky outside is getting light . Firsts WEIEN , in our youth , we at- tended the seashore , the spectacle never varied . All those under the age of decorum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand , intent on being the first one into the waves . In that time , it was widely believed that the last one in was a rotten egg . Salt water seems to bring to the surface much the same competitive instinct in older folk . That 's what we concluded recently while touring a preview of a new display on the deep sea , which will stay at the American Museum of Natural History through mid-May . It seemed to us that we could n't turn a corner in the spiffy exhibition hall without meeting a mariner who had been first at something or other . Walter H. Jahn , for instance , explained that he had been the first to take photographs , top to bottom , of the Gilliss Seamount , one of thirty-two seamounts in the New England chain . " It 's the first time man has ever seen this seamount visually , " Jahn announced , and he added , " Almost all the photos I take are of things people have never seen . This is the frontier . It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera with you . " The giant photos , which reminded us of views of the moon 's surface , were taken in blackand-white with an array of enormous cameras and strobes paid for by the Navy . Mr. Jahn told us he had just returned from a photographic expedition to the Florida escarpment , where he was using color film . " Some of my pictures from Florida would blow your socks off , " he told us . Though Jacques Mayol , the first man to descend to a depth of a hundred metres  --  three hundred and twenty-eight feet  --  while holding his breath , was not on hand for the exhibit , there was an engrossing movie about his dive . In the film , Mr. Mayol , a mustachioed Frenchman , explained that he had practically lived with dolphins for two years and they had taught him how to relax and breathe  --  advice he had taken in preference to that offered by a physiologist , who warned Mayol that at a hundred metres his lungs would likely collapse . The film 's narrator , speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea ( or the plains of Africa ) , remarked , " Through meditation , Mayol has overcome the instinctive urge to rush toward the salvation of breath . " As Mayol began his record sink , he took an appropriately deep breath , grabbed hold of a sixty-six-pound weight , and slid down a wire to the hundred-metre depth , where he let go of the weight and headed back up to the surface . The narrator explained as Mayol ascended that since three minutes and some had elapsed all of Mayol 's oxygen was exhausted and his brain cells were starting to die . But Mayol retained enough presence of mind to holler and mug for the cam-eras when he finally broke the surface . In the middle of the exhibition room , there stood a three-quarter-size model of the sort of suit one wears if one wishes to walk on the ocean floor . Bulkier than an astronaut 's getup , the gear is used mostly by the men who make repairs on deep-sea oil-drilling platforms , explained Dr. Sylvia Earle , a curator at the California Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " It was first developed to salvage the Lusitania , ' Jim ' does n't stand for anything . It 's just that the first diver who was willing to wear it was named Jim , and that was part of his price . " Dr. Earle knows a good deal about the Jim suit , having worn it when she became the first wom-an ever to walk on the ocean floor below a thousand feet , and the first human being to stroll at that depth without being connect-ed by a line to the surface . A movie of Dr. Earle 's dive was playing right near the Mayol movie , and we watched it with her . There was a shot of Dr. Earle riding out in a boat to the spot where she would be dropped into the deep . As she speculated , in a voice-over , on what could go wrong ? leaks , tangled lines , and a number of other things  --  the camera zoomed in on her hands , which were be-ing wrung , apparently in a sweaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " Dr. Earle ad " T To begin with , I would like to express my sincere thanks and deep appreciation for the opportunity to meet with you . While there are still profound daft ? erences between us , I think the very fact of my presence here today is a major breakthrough . " mitted to us . At the dive site , Dr. Earle climbed into her Jim suit and was hoisted onto the nose of a small submarine , which was to taxi her to the ocean floor . Over an intercom , an assistant on the surface kept saying things like " Holokai , we 're neutrally buoyant . Sylvia is secure . . . . Make you one hundred feet and going down . " Finally , at twelve hundred and fifty feet , Dr. Earle climbed off the sub and took a walk along the ocean bottom , where she said , " This is so great . " Predictably , though , Dr. Earle  --  a marine botanist  --  is not content to rest on her underwater laurels . She showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved from the Jim suit and have enabled oil-rig workers and scientists to go even deeper . There 's Wasp ( " It 's called Wasp because it 's black and yellow and it sort of flies underwater " ) , which goes to two thousand feet . And then there 's Mantis , a rocketlike vehicle that goes down to twenty-three hundred feet , and that became famous when it attacked 007 in the James Bond hit " For Your Eyes Only . " And , finally , there 's Deep Rover , which is yet to go into use but will someday serve as " a Model T for the oceans , " according to Dr. Earle . Resembling a one-person helicopter , it can go more than three thousand feet deep when it 's made of acrylic . And if it has a five-inch glass shell the craft should hold up right down to the nadir of that proverbial hole in the bottom of the sea . Deep Rover is the next-best thing to scuba diving ; its mechanical hands are so sensitive they can pick up eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the " diving by committee " problems that Dr. Earle says are endemic in submarines . But more money and more attention are needed . A natural rivalry seems to have sprung up between the space program and undersea exploration . " Just one less space shuttle would make a tremendous difference , " laments a lab-coated type who appears in one of the exhibit 's movies . Dr. Earle adds , " You say you want to go to the moon , and ten years later you 're on the moon . Why ca n't you say , ' I want to walk around at thirty-seven thousand eight hundred feet , at the bottom of the ocean ' ? " We have no doubt that Dr. Earle will , and probably before anyone else . Mood and Rumor LAST week , the world divided into two groups : people asking " Who is this Laurie Anderson , and what is her art ? " and people who had witnessed , over two consecutive evenings at the Brooklyn Academy of Music , her remarkable multimedia performance cycle entitled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found themselves face to face with a question of their own : " Where , exactly , was her art ? " It seemed everywhere and nowhere on the stage . The most promising target in the search for Miss Anderson 's art was her almost always present person as she spoke or sang her words and music , played her unconventional , highly electrified fiddle , or 38 FEBRUARY 21 , 1983 summoned sounds and video images with a sorcerer 's gestures . She looked a small , purposeful , vulnerable figure , in a shapeless black satin jacket and pants , and with mad , cartoon-strip spikes of Punk hair , but art was there , all right  --  indelible , if invisible . There seemed to be art in her hand , pointing like a hand on a clock ; ticking like a metronome ; resting half in , half out of her pocket ; making shadow animals appear . There seemed to be art in her feet , clad in bright-red socks and flat black slippers , and carrying their owner about the stage with an oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was doing almost nothing  --  moving in near-darkness to her next cue spot onstage , for instance , like a provincial stagehand in days when stagehands were burdened with dim between-scenes shapes that could as easily be trees as chairs . At moments , though , Miss Anderson 's very presence seemed to fade and nearly vanish , and under the full glare of a spotlight she would turn into a faint sketch of herself . As for the love affair that the artist appeared to conduct with " state of the art " technology  --  the world of video , laser , electronic tape , digital keyboards , and so forth  --  this served to throw her audience still further off the scent . Why did the violin produce a sound like her voice or make music after she had put down the bow ? Why were the synthesizer chords in the air so much more complicated than what her fingers played on the keys ? Mi crophones stood about like nuclear-family groupings of Giacometti stick figures silhouetted against the changing fields of light . Perhaps they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidled up to each in turn , turned a knob at its metal waist , and drew its elongated head in close as she began to move her lips . But then her voice passed through the mike and came out sounding like a public-address system , like a telephone , like a child , or ( pitched an octave lower ) like Jack Benny . If technology was intended only as a further sieve for the art to leak simultaneously into and out of , that art washed in and out of her audience as well . Miss Anderson said recently that she tended to he more preoccupied with mood and rumor than with hard fact . As the fashionable and knowing crowd moved through the aisles and the lobby of RAM , floating in its world of mood and rumor and reputation-mongering chat , its talk was part of the whole , a tape that Laurie Anderson might have spliced . " The Kitchen , " said one man . " Warner Records , " said a woman nearby . " David Salle . Julian Schnabel . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that word anymore . " " His wife 's an avant-garde dancer . He works at the Morgan bank . " " Purity . " " Rock and roll . " " They got bored and left in the intermission . Went off with that Conceptualist to have some supper at Raoul 's . " " This is really fun . " The Prune Principle FOR I N G THE NEW YORKER ( 1 ) Identify your troblern . F. W. ( Woody ) Davis , executive director of the California Prune Board , shows how , isolating his industry 's difficulty as follows : " We have research which indicates that people do n't dislike prunes . They just never think about them . It 's an awareness problem . " Adds Prune Board public-relations woman Susan l ' 4Iesick , " Prunes are the Forgotten Fruit . " ( 2 ) Hire a snazzy P. R. firm . Ketchum Public Relations , maybe . Its people will stage your media event for you . Perhaps they can build you a kiosk ( color dependent on fruit ; purple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for apricots ) on the lower level of Grand Central Terminal . Once it 's built , they can fill it with baskets of prunes ( or whatever ) , prune recipes , and fresh-faced young people paid to impale prunes on toothpicks and hand them to passersby. ( 3 ) Create slogans . Alliteration is mucho mandatory here  --  something like " I Prefer Prunes " sounds considerably catchier than " Snackin ' Good Prunes . " These slogans can be put on buttons , banners , and , with luck , the lips of the public . ( 4 ) Find a local angle . This is vital if reporters are to descend in droves . ( The descent in droves of reporters occupies the same place in the mind of a publicist as the ascent en masse does in the philosophy of a fundamentalist . ) The Prune Board showed its abundant good sense by engaging the services of Talent Unlimited , a group of local high-school students who will sing , dance , and , if asked , wear garbage bags . ( This makes them resemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be closely tied to the product , so that the two ca n't he easily divorced by a TV producer who might love pictures of local high-school students and yet not prefer prunes . In this case , the Prune Board cleverly instructed the youngsters to sing about prunes . The result was " What I Did for Prunes , " to the tune of " What I Did for Love , " and " I Love to Eat Prunes , " an adaptation of " I Love a Parade , " which included the memorable lyrics : If I 'm in the mood I 'll have a few stewed And eat them from spoons For I love to eat prunes . ( 5 ) Set aside some members of the local angle for interviews . This provides the much-vaunted human touch . Mr. Karl M. Friedman , the Talent Unlimited musical-theatre director , was a perfect choice . He told all who asked him not only that he was a professional lyricist currently engaged in raising funds to stage a Broadway show he had written ( " On a Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scant five minutes to compose both prune anthems , but also that he loved prunes  --  loved them enough so that he often adhered to the so-called Nassau County diet , which involved the intake of prune juice . Some of the members of Mr. Friedman 's troupe , though kicky and great fun , illustrated one subtle danger of the local-angle interview . When the students were asked if they truly liked prunes , they often said things like " Yes . I eat them all the time . " Pause . " They 're so full of Vitamin A. " Pause . Uncontrollable giggling . ( 6 ) Include a gimmick . A gimmick that creates the illusion of competition ca n't help enhancing your media event . Americans may or may not prefer prunes , but they love to take sides . Realizing this , the Prune Board people shrewdly designed a ballot , which the kiosk attendants made all the prune eaters fill out . The beauty of this ballot lay in the construction of the questions . No. 2 , for instance , began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three possible answers : " definitely , " " probably , " and " not sure . " Any voter from , say , the Ukraine knows about this sort of ballot , but Americans tend to be gullihle. ( 7 ) Declare z'ictory . Modesty is no virtue here . After tallying the ballots from twelve hundred and thirty-five commuters who stopped by the kiosk in a single day , a Ketchum Public Relations representative , Gay Leightheiser , announced that sixty-six per cent had indicated that they would definitely eat prunes again and twenty-six per cent were safely in the " probably " category . Only eight per cent admitted that they were not sure . " I think the results are pretty clear , " Gay Leightheiser said in a firm , confident voice . " A prune consensus is developing .
