SAPPHO 's school on the afternoon of the annual ritual to Aphrodite , goddess of love , but , previous to her Olympian designation , goddess of the creative life that is in women , goddess of life and of death . It is to these earlier , more inclusive states that SAPPHO and her students wish to return the goddess . In their rooms in SAPPHO 's school , her students make ready for the evening ritual . CLEIS , SAPPHO 's teenage daughter , tries on endless combinations of clothing ; ATTHIS , SAPPHO 's lover and intimate of several years , writes and is occasionally taken by bursts of unspecified , nervous energy , focused in SAPPHO 's direction . TIMAS , SAPPHO 's drummer , readies her instrument and watches . SAPPHO sits on her bed and writes , occasionally she gets up and exercises . From the distance , we begin to hear a new voice , that of ANACTORIA , singing a Sardinian song as she walks toward the gates of the school . We lose the voice momentarily , then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm on her drum . And the life of the school quickens . The women begin to sing fragments of what becomes the opening round . Sometimes they sing the entire poem , sometimes only a phrase . At first , silence returns between the snatches of song , and sometimes ANACTORIA 's voice is heard , getting closer . When ANACTORIA arrives , she sings her entire song and the round begins as each woman adds her voice . During the singing and to the rhythm of the drum ANACTORIA dances her sensuous dance of greeting . ANACTORIA Standing by my bed In gold sandals Dawn that very moment awoke me.3 p. 3 SAPPHO I asked myself What , Sappho , can you give one who has everything , like Aphrodite ? 4 ATTHIS Although they are Only breath , words which I command are immortal.9 CLEIS That afternoon Girls ripe to marry wove the flower-heads into necklaces.10 When the round ends , ANACTORIA continues to dance , and TIMAS plays for her on the drum . CLEIS begins to imitate ANACTORIA 's dance , while ATTHIS and SAPPHO stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to sing : SAPPHO And their feet move Rhythmically , as tender feet of Cretan girls danced once around an altar of love , crushing a circle in the soft smooth flowering grass.23 The dance assumes the rhythm of the song and both end simultaneously . SAPPHO Timas , your drum is the happiest welcome we have . Happiness is the best of the gifts you could bring tonight to the glade . TIMAS plays a few happy beats on her drum . ATTHIS approaches TIMAS and places the headdress of snakes and the robe which belong to Aphrodite on her head and shoulders. p. 4 ATTHIS I crown you goddess of life , death , birth ; the madness of love ; fall fruits ; decay ; the frenzied creative self ; and whatever else is deserving of praise ! ANACTORIA Hear ! Hear ! CLEIS gaily , to TIMAS You will be Aphrodite tonight in the mime ! TIMAS plays a happy response , but SAPPHO reaches for the crown . SAPPHO That role is mine alone to decide . CLEIS But we promised her ! TIMAS plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLEIS Can not . Her tongue was cut out by soldiers who ravaged her village . My mother bought her half-starved in the market and taught her to talk on the skin of a drum . She sat silent for weeks and then she began to bang on the skin . She broke three drums to bits before she made up the wildest song we had ever heard and we sat from sunset to dawn weeping and wailing with her as she played . The sound erupts from CLEIS , ATTHIS , SAPPHO , and TIMAS . It is an ancient cry , expressing both joy and grief ; praise and terror . Eleleu , Iou , Iou ! Eleleu , Iou , Iou ! ANACTORIA shudders at the sound and at the story. p. 5 ATTHIS " Do n't pity me , " she says . She plays what she feels ; since each sound is true , each is beautiful . SAPPHO Now , while the sun peaks , we must rest , for this night will bring us no sleep . Timas , gather the wreaths and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , show Anactoria to her room . Welcome , Ana , to us . You have come at the height of our year when we inquire most deeply within and ask for the grace to become whatever desire dictates . Go , now , and rest ; I will call you back before the ritual starts ; I would tell you the ways of this worship we make to ourselves . In all Greece you will not have seen nor heard of its like . Only here do we seek that earlier state where no seam exists between desire and deed . SAPPHO takes ANACTORIA 's hand . She kisses CLEIS lightly . CLEIS , ANACTORIA and TIMAS exit . ATTHIS I will stay . I do not feel like being alone . SAPPHO Come , then , and sit . ATTHIS sits on SAPPHO 's bed . SAPPHO approaches and gently strokes her hair . SAPPHO Do you wish silence or talk ? ATTHIS Tell me what you are thinking while you stand idly stroking my hair . p. 6 SAPPHO bending and kissing her lightly on the head I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first saw you on the street , a long-limbed child singing and dancing behind her mother 's full skirts . I stopped to purchase some parsley and thyme she carried from market to market in woven baskets strapped to her head and her back . I saw her silence your mouth as I stopped , and watched you stick out your tongue , at which one of us I still to this day am not sure , but I felt you mocking my wealth . I loved you , Atthis , when you were a graceless child and you paid no heed to my love . " Send her to me , " I said , pressing gold coins into her hand . " Send her to me when the milk you fed her on first turns to blood and stains her thighs . Send her ripened and sad in the month of her first grief for what can not live . I will teach her to sing love songs then . " ATTHIS I did not understand a word that had passed but I saw the gold change hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herbs or sold as she sold herself in the late afternoons to the first hungering man . Yet when the time came , it was I who remembered your words and I who made ready to leave while she turned her head and cursed the quickness of years . " I will not have you go without something to bind up your hair , " she said and pulled out a dark purple ribbon she had hidden between her two breasts . For the last time , she wiped the dirt from my face with her spit . " Go , " she said , " go and make something out of yourself . " Then she looked down at her toes , hard and cracked , the color of stone piled on the earth . Her mind has fled , I thought , back to the time she carried me miles strapped to her back with her herbs and she first heard my nonsense songs in her ears . I cried out , and saw her body grow stiff . I left without looking back and walked till I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you said , as you fed me on milk and on figs . " You will make your home here with us . Young girls with large appetites stir up my songs of love . " p. 7 SAPPHO Did I say that ? How blatant I was in my youth . Yet it took time to touch . ATTHIS You were as shy as I was . Except when you lectured us . Then , you terrified me . ATTHIS leaps up . She puts her hands on SAPPHO 's shoulders and speaks forcefully into her face ; it is an exaggeration of how she remembers SAPPHO to have been in those days . ATTHIS " Only if we women regain our strength , might a balance be reached between the other and the self . Only if we grow less afraid can we keep hatred from the world . It 's up to the women poets to sing . Up to us to recover the time when women risked everything for knowledge of self , when daughters were loved above all else , when we formed our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must take up . " ATTHIS lets go of SAPPHO 's shoulders . She laughs . You 've mellowed over the years . SAPPHO I have . But the old ways worked . You , an illiterate gypsy-like girl , began to write two weeks after you 'd come to my house . Overnight you became here she mocks ATTHIS , as ATTHIS was " the greatest poet who ever lived , better than Sappho , but misunderstood . " Or a " failure who never again would write a word , " storming around breaking things , sobbing for hours in my arms . p. 8 ATTHIS I must have driven you mad . SAPPHO With your talent , your tempers and fears , you held me entranced . I am a slave to that moment of youth when for the first time one 's power is sensed . The world seems changeable then . And you were a monumental piece of work . A genius risen stark from an impoverished class . ATTHIS Timas , too , also because of you . SAPPHO Yes . ATTHIS And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them leave in a year . ATTHIS All are changed . And some show a spark that might burn . The new girl you welcomed just now . There 's something special to her . SAPPHO Yes , she reminds me of you as you were . ATTHIS Yes . She will follow wherever you lead . SAPPHO I am too old to fire her . I have lost the spark . ATTHIS Not in my eyes . SAPPHO The times have closed to my dreams . Greece forgets women 's mysteries stand at its base . Zeus is set up over us . My lyrics are thought titilating , small , private , obscene and are grandly praised by voyeurs who name me the eighth wonder of the world ! Nature 's own freak , a woman who feels and dares speak . Scarcely a person outside this school will admit an ancient power sings through my verse . p. 9 ATTHIS You talk like this when you are tired . Tonight , through the song and the dance your strength will return . SAPPHO I need to be stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ATTHIS Why do you speak this way ? SAPPHO Why speak at all ? Except to give form to what feelings have bid . ATTHIS Last night when I came to your bed , you pretended to be asleep . The night before , you kept Cleis tucked in your arms . I did not weep , or cry out , or demand , but , Sappho , I am afraid . SAPPHO Do n't be afraid . You are grown and I must let you go . ATTHIS I am grown and I choose to remain . Before the ritual begins , take me into your arms . SAPPHO Before the ritual starts , we must practise honesty with ourselves . You are grown and will find a new love . I must go back to the source of my dream . ATTHIS You are cruel . SAPPHO kisses her head . SAPPHO Something is cruel , not us . Something , not us , yet its cruelty works in our hearts . ATTHIS It was you who taught me how to be kind . Can you not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , kindness is not the best of our virtues . Perhaps kindness is taught to silence the truth of the heart which is seldom as kind as we wish it . ATTHIS Whatever is wrong , we can work to mend it . SAPPHO Nothing is wrong , only time . Time and my need to defy it by being always at its beginning . ATTHIS Let 's go back to the start of our love . I can act simple and unschooled again . SAPPHO When I first kissed you , I told you this day would come , as it has come , and I asked if you wanted my love , though it would last but an instant . Do you remember your answer ? ATTHIS I silenced your lips with my tongue . But how could I have known then the end of our golden hour would ever come , though you told me over and over . And how , had it ended bitter and hard a thousand times , could I , barely more than a child , have resisted . Nor would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot with warning upon mine . SAPPHO But now you must let my words in though my lips resist you . ATTHIS You will not kiss me ? SAPPHO Can not . Can not kiss you as I kissed you once . p. 11 ATTHIS Three nights ago , I came running to show you two lines which had perfectly caught the start of a thought that seemed crucial to me . I asked for a kiss so I might finish the verse . You gave me one gladly it seemed . In response , my words leapt from my heart . What has happened since that moonless night ? SAPPHO The song I released in you left me silent . I sat for an hour alone watching the sky pale into dawn . When I rose I was changed . I no longer felt an answering call in my heart . ATTHIS How can that be ? How can someone who held my wet flesh in her hands turn cold ? SAPPHO It has happened before . Feeling between two lovers has died . ATTHIS Yes , you have sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing and pain . Do you cast me away for the sake of a new image of grief ? SAPPHO Do you cling because you wish me to drown in your child-like faith in my love ? ATTHIS You are cruel to tell me today when my heart ought to be light , for my song was chosen , even over yours , to be sung tonight in the glade where we sing Aphrodite 's praise . Are you jealous , Sappho ? Jealous of my success ? Are you jealous because I have put into verse things that you teach but do not feel in yourself ? p. 12 SAPPHO No . I am proud . In skill I think you need never bow to anyone . Not one who may see the sunlight in time to come . 51 ATTHIS The lyrics I wrote were for us . Remember the day we dove from the cliff and lost in the vulva-like folds of the sea , we laughed and felt safe . Later , we lay on the shore while the wind rose and the rising tide covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suddenly thought as you opened me with your tongue . I grew wild and cried , " I will leap to my death from these rocks . " But you held me close while I struggled and wept and I fell asleep on your breast . Tonight 's song was to make up for that day my fear marred . SAPPHO As it does , for you have made an exquisite thing from your fear . ATTHIS But after it 's acted and sung you wo n't call me home to your bed ? SAPPHO After it 's done I will want to know something else . I will want to know what would happen if souls could touch as completely as flesh . What would happen , Atthis , right now , if you could inhabit my heart and I yours ? ATTHIS You would feel my longing and pain . SAPPHO Yes . And you would know how the limits age puts on dreams turn me desperate . How the lustre of youth abandons my flesh till I am left facing death . But such rare empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to the end of our love . p. 13 ATTHIS she begins to circle SAPPHO , speaking in a frenzied , staccato tone I am named for a boy who died young because a woman he scorned followed him until she infused a great cold breath in his veins . I am named Atthis because my poor mother thought a hard-hearted death to be a far better fate than the slow pain of one who is scorned . But it 's you who should bear my name . The pain you have caused will turn to ice in your veins . Both of us can not live past what you 've done . From off-stage , as if in anticipation of the ritual , we hear the mourning-celebratory cry : Eleleu , Iou , Iou ! Eleleu , Iou , Iou ! SAPPHO taking a shimmering shawl off her chair I have kept this for you to wear on the eve that your words are sung in worship of what through love and love 's death we become . SAPPHO hands the shawl to ATTHIS who drops it upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks your arms putting it on , pitiless love . As ATTHIS goes , SAPPHO 's adolescent daughter CLEIS comes running in , trailing a mess of half-woven yarn . Behind her , concerned , is TIMAS . CLEIS throws herself at her mother 's knees . ATTHIS watches for a moment the girl who has taken up the place she has just left , then she turns and goes . TIMAS settles herself close to SAPPHO and CLEIS. p. 14 CLEIS It 's no use Mother dear , I ca n't finish my weaving You may blame Aphrodite soft as she is she has almost killed me with love for that boy.12 SAPPHO comforts her daughter , comforting herself as well with her mothering motions . She pulls her daughter to her and sings her the same song she used to sing when CLEIS was a baby in her arms . SAPPHO Hush darling I have a small daughter called Cleis , who is like a golden flower I would n't take all Croesus ' kingdom with love thrown in , for her.17 CLEIS Why , when I love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of white and red anemones . He took them , laughing , then turned and ran off with Gryinno , that big-hipped girl . SAPPHO gathering up the shawl ATTHIS has left behind ; her tone is light and playful My darling , what have mothers said since time began to their tender girl-children . . . you are too good for him ! Never mind , if he took your flowers , he has taken part of your heart , and your goodness will work its way into him . She hugs CLEIS . Anyway , think , if he had turned and pulled you into his arms , you would have been so scared you might have kicked him or bit him . Better he has taken what you handed him willingly and gone than stolen a bud that will ripen itself in good time . p. 15 CLEIS Still , it seems I shall die from love of him . Feel here , my heart , pounding as if it will break . TIMAS plays her drum , melodramatically . Meanwhile , I am pursued wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who seems to grow fonder of me with each scornful abuse I sling at him . " Cabbage-head , " " olive-eye , " " bird-beaked squatting creature . " Because I am your daughter he fancies I speak only pure-toned love images . SAPPHO If you truly spoke with my voice your words would have even more sting for all those who hunt you too soon . CLEIS delightedly , as she makes this up " Web-footed , donkey-assed nose-dripping platypus , why have you cast your pale leprous glance in my direction ? Do you wish conversation ? Your green eyes shed mucousy tears at the melodic sound of my words ; my heart shudders and stops ; you reach out a misshapen claw . I draw back . The snake that hangs limp in your lap suddenly hisses and rises up . As I run I can hear you bray satisfaction . " The two laugh and TIMAS plays a trill on her lyre . SAPPHO Cleis , your tongue is a murder instrument . The crass poet Archilochus so satirized a girl who had scorned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . And your verse , my child , is far stronger than his . p. 16 CLEIS But harmless , for no man would admit that . SAPPHO Until they can , you should keep your best self safe from these boys . They judge our beauty as harshly as we do theirs and delight in our softness as much as we delight in their supple limbs . But they remain deaf to our words , as if Zeus himself , in fear for the power he wields , forbade them to learn a tongue graceful and fluid . So , darling child , we will gather tonight to worship our fair Aphrodite from whom our best creativity comes . It seems to me , after the song you have sung , you would do well to cleanse your ears on Atthis 's verse . CLEIS Mother , who is to play Aphrodite tonight ? Timas would like to , I know , but if she ca n't , let it be me . SAPPHO You are too young . CLEIS I am a year past menses . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means . SAPPHO laughing I have no doubt that you do . CLEIS Then let me be the goddess tonight . SAPPHO You are not ready yet to dance the mad possessed dance on the mountain tops . . . CLEIS I am. p. 17 SAPPHO Not ready yet to give up a self not yet known . CLEIS I am not afraid of going down into the cave . SAPPHO Wait awhile , child , I am well-trained to see when the time for that passage has come . It is not a moment I would keep you from . CLEIS Then , at least , let me stay here and help you dress and watch you anoint whomever you choose . SAPPHO I would rather you went to help Atthis , and let her help you , for she loves you as tenderly as if you were her daughter . CLEIS Before I am banished , tell me , as you used to do , what I should wear . CLEIS makes ready to hear one of her favorite songs ; TIMAS begins to play . SAPPHO Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sardis to give you , Cleis , such as I wore and my mother always said that in her day a purple ribbon looped in the hair was thought to be high style indeed but we were dark : a girl whose hair is yellower than torchlight should wear no headdress but fresh flowers . 83 CLEIS kisses her . SAPPHO Now , love child , run off to Atthis and , for me , be especially kind to her . CLEIS exits . Silence . SAPPHO turns to TIMAS. p. 18 SAPPHO Timas , you who keep all my secrets safe in the silence that shelters your own , forgive me my frailty one more time . I can not make you goddess tonight . With his venom Irresistible and bittersweet that loosener of limbs , Love reptile-like strikes me down53 I must give the snake-crown to the innocent girl who with her gay guileless charm has swallowed my life in her own . TIMAS responds on her drum , with increasing anger . Do n't chide me , now , Timas , please . You can be Aphrodite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMAS is still angry . SAPPHO Timas , I ca n't help my choice . A song has begun in my flesh and it will sing itself . TIMAS exits . SAPPHO begins to sing while she waits for her chosen lover to come . If you will come I shall put out new pillows for you to rest on , 45 I shall unwind your braid , comb out your hair . If you will come I will rub your neck and arms with warm oil , take off your sandals , caress your cool ankles . I will lift up your gown , if you will let me , and ask if my hands might be led to the gate of your heart and if they might spread wide the portal that guards unguarded delight . ANACTORIA 's voice is heard outside . ANACTORIA Oh , no , what have I done . I ca n't get my hand out . A moment later she is half falling into SAPPHO 's room . Her hand is caught inside a decorated jar she has brought as a gift . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to your room that without thinking what I was doing I put my hand inside this jar I 've carried all the way from Sardis . Now I 'm stuck ; I ca n't get my hand out ; it 's started to sweat ; I 'm trapped in this vessel I meant you to store oil in . At this moment , ANACTORIA 's hand slips free of the jar which shatters on the floor . Oh , now how did that happen ? I 'm free but the jar is ruined . She kneels and begins to try to piece it back together . That will never do . That 's Demeter seated with Dionysus 's head upon her . And Hermes , Zeus 's messenger , stands at her side where Persephone ought to be standing . How like the world we live in now , and I ca n't set it right again . I ca n't find the goddess 's head . It must have shattered past recognition . What a fine mess I 've made and to think I was sent here to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a bear ? How do I dare bumble my way into your room ? p. 19 SAPPHO laughing : Hush , sweet one , hush , sit here , listen to what I will teach you : She sings . Awed by her splendor Stars near the lovely moon cover their own bright faces when she is roundest and lights earth with her silver24 So it is with a woman possessed by her power . Not even the brightest star outshines her . ANACTORIA leaps up and spins around with delight ; she kisses SAPPHO lightly on the cheek . ANACTORIA Sappho , what a beautiful song . You are so beautiful and I am so dumb . I swear I ca n't make up a word . A phrase would be sheer impossibility . As for dancing , well , my left foot does n't speak to my right . And , Sappho , I am not pretty ! SAPPHO Beautiful , simply . ANACTORIA Do you think so ? SAPPHO You , my heart , are the new hope I have longed for . You are strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I have asked the goddess for a love whose needs would be met by my needs , and I have asked it , she has answered me with your presence . " Here , Sappho , " she whispered , " is one who will bloom as you teach her . " Grateful , I answered : " I will choose her to wear the snake-crown ; dancing your dance , entering into your unknown space she will learn how to praise you . " p. 20 ANACTORIA Sappho , stop . Atthis chose Timas this afternoon . SAPPHO She transgressed the limits I 've set . The choice of the goddess is mine . ANACTORIA It 's not fair to the others who had hoped you would choose them that I , a newcomer , am so quickly chosen . SAPPHO Chance sent you to me and I have chosen to please her . Two roles remain , mother and maid , who lift you , their soul , from the belly-like cavern . Chance will pick them . ANACTORIA Sappho , you be the goddess tonight . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calm in her heart . I am nothing . SAPPHO You are the woman untouched whose touch rouses creation . Come , heart , I will dress you . She releases ANACTORIA 's tunic ; ANACTORIA stands in her shift . ANACTORIA Sappho , stop . I am frightened . SAPPHO You need only give yourself over to life that is in you . You need only let yourself rise when we call you . All else will be done by our voices rising together and the sound of your step on the earth , thundering power . She slips a gold and black ritual garment over ANACTORIA 's head . It falls formally to the ground . She begins to look statuesque. p. 21 ANACTORIA I am not worthy of this . Not capable yet . I have not wrapped a lover between my legs , nor let a child escape me . I have not raged at the loss of youth , or of hope for what youth should have brought me . I have not heard my singing unanswered , have not become bitter with longing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until I grew soft enough to let chance embrace me . I am not the goddess you make me . SAPPHO brings the snake crown to ANACTORIA and places it on her head . SAPPHO You are desire , desire unripe , unripened but not unheeded . You are what makes woman great so we have named you goddess . Now the music begins to be heard , faintly at first , then growing stronger and clearer throughout the scene . The music is timbrel and flute . The timbrel giving the beat as if of many women 's feet dancing , the flute song wild , plaintive , ecstatic . It doubles back on itself from grief to joy and includes the motif " Eleleu , Iou , Iou . " SAPPHO gives ANACTORIA a staff like those the Maenads carry on the mountain . ANACTORIA I am not endless love , not forgiveness . I am not one who holds the beast-like child to the breast , who ripens and thrills to the hungry pull of those lips . I fear dark . I fear death . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin in ANACTORIA 's hand . ANACTORIA begins to sway with it dangling from one hand , her staff held horizontally in the other. p. 22 SAPPHO You are the sorrow that smites and the joy that wipes sorrow out . You are the salt sweet underground milk rushing toward light , bursting the mouth of the earth . You are the force that binds wound to wound , beast to breast , life to death in one rhythm . Fear is the huntress of those who fear you . Fearless is she who loves you . ANACTORIA sways to the rhythms of the timbrels , the music of the flutes . She is the possessed Maenad loose on the mountain , losing her fear of frenzy inside the frenzy itself . The music and dancing peak . There is a flash of light . ANACTORIA is caught in a freeze at the height of her frenzy . Sudden darkness . The sound of bull-roarers . ANACTORIA has dropped out of sight . As the light returns we hear the lament of the women , " Iou , Iou , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . CHANTING WOMEN We have followed her step , her sound , her dance , have followed her wild release until she fell and was swallowed up by the earth . Iou , Iou ! We have come to her grove , to her glade , to her belly-like place in the earth , bearing gifts from the grain , the bee , and the breast , bearing honey , milk and the seed . Eleleu , Eleleu ! Now we choose two by chance who will be for us Mother and Maid . Two will approach the cave where womb-like , death-like she roots , and lay there the fruits of the earth , calling her up . Eleleu Iou , Eleleu Iou ! As the sound of the paean is made , ATTHIS and SAPPHO approach the center from opposite sides of the space . They have been chosen by lot to assume these roles and did not know the other was also chosen . ATTHIS carries a stalk of golden grain in one hand and bowl of honey in the other ; SAPPHO , a stalk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays her stalk on the ground : None have I longed for more than her whose path I have followed here . . . SAPPHO as she lays down her stalk : . . . to the center where all is brought up from the dark unknown . ATTHIS None have I longed for more than her whose lips I have longed to touch . ATTHIS takes honey from the bowl on her fingers and lets it dribble down her lips ; she does the same to SAPPHO , trembling . SAPPHO No one has desired her more than I who drinks of her own sweet milk . SAPPHO takes a drink of milk from the jar , and offers a drink to ATTHIS . The following is stated ; it breaks the pattern of the song . ATTHIS AND SAPPHO together or alternating lines : We are conscious of death , all-knowing of that unknown . We fear and we yearn for that end . SAPPHO kneels on one side of the omphalos . ATTHIS I have wanted to curl between your flesh , have wanted to sleep in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , living , I have rejected death and she is reborn as love . ATTHIS reaches down and grasps Aphrodite 's hand . ATTHIS She is born from that dark into us , her soul which is love and her flesh . SAPPHO reaches down into the omphalos and grasps Aphrodite 's other hand . SAPPHO Flesh of her soul we touch and are born into self by this love . The sound of rejoicing , flute-song . " Eleleu , Eleleu " is heard as Aphrodite rises in the classic pose . ANACTORIA sings solo and then the verse is repeated by ensemble : And I rise from the earth or am washed ashore by the sea . Salt is my smell , honey my taste . Milk , which is life , I have brought . I have changed desire for death into sensations of love . The goddess has risen . The ritual moment is over . ATTHIS and SAPPHO remain , each holding one of ANACTORIA 's hands . More from SAPPHO 's response than from ANACTORIA , it dawns on ATTHIS that this woman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible irony of the ritual and her part in it flashes before her . At this moment , CLEIS approaches SAPPHO , tugging at her. p. 25 CLEIS Mother , he has asked me to come , tonight when the ritual ended . He would wait , he said , at the edge of our circle . SAPPHO to ANACTORIA : Come , I will take you back to my room , take off your dress and your crown . ATTHIS She is still in her trance , still possessed . SAPPHO to ATTHIS : Your song is a success . ATTHIS Yes . Your breast rises and falls . Your eyes shine and I , the creator of this , go home alone . SAPPHO You are free to choose someone new . ATTHIS What is she but the actor who lives through my breath ? What is she but my essence singing itself ? SAPPHO Your anger must answer you . I can not . ATTHIS releases ANACTORIA 's hand ; she squats down beside her . CLEIS Mother , will you listen to me . He has asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CLEIS Adonis , himself , my heart . He waits for me where the waterfall wets the dark earth near the apple trees . p. 26 SAPPHO What are you talking about ? CLEIS Mother , please , I 've no time to chat . SAPPHO The boy you gave flowers to , who scorned you this afternoon ? Or is it the boy you scorned ? Who wants you to come when you are full of our song ? SAPPHO lets go of ANACTORIA 's hand . Continues to address CLEIS . You will come home with me tonight . CLEIS I will not . I should have just left . I should n't have told you a thing . SAPPHO If he loves you , whoever he is , he 'll understand . CLEIS What do you know ! You who refuse to lie with a man . SAPPHO I conceived a child in love with a man . A child whose love I will keep until she knows why she gives it up . CLEIS Let me go . He was right . He warned me not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll sing one another to sleep . Tomorrow you 'll see him again in the hot noonday sun . Decide then if you want his love . CLEIS The minute I 've closed my eyes , you 'll call to your bed whomever you wish and you 'll make love through the night . And the minute you do , I 'll run off . p. 27 SAPPHO Come home with me now , you determined child . We ca n't argue here in the glade . She turns to ANACTORIA . Ana , dear , follow us home . SAPPHO and CLEIS exit . ANACTORIA blinks out of her trance . ANACTORIA Oh , my head aches from this crown . I 'm dripping with sweat . She smells her underarms . I smell like sour milk ! My feet are cut . She inspects one foot while leaning clumsily on ATTHIS 's shoulder , then she sits down hard . I 'm so tired . She laughs , gaily . A fine goddess of death and desire I make ! Do you suppose Aphrodite herself felt like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth , and no one cared how she felt ? Poor girl , Aphrodite . She laughs again . Atthis , help me take off this crown of snakes . Too bad they 're stuffed , I 'm so starved I could eat them up . If I ate snakes , that is , which I do n't . ATTHIS laughs with her and looks at her . Then she rises , offering ANACTORIA her hand to pull her up . ATTHIS Come , I have figs and nuts and a cold clay jar full of milk . I will lay them out next to your thigh . We will eat and be full when we rise . ATTHIS and ANACTORIA exit. @x SAPPHO is alone in the glade where the ritual took place . A small brazier burns incense outside the cave where the goddess Aphrodite is worshipped . SAPPHO paces . Dawn . SAPPHO Tonight I 've watched The moon and then the Pleiades go down . The night is now half-gone ; youth goes ; I am in bed alone . 64 She glances at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments you wring from me now , Cyprian , I who once decked your altar out with tales of clustering girls , ripe as moons . SAPPHO tears the paper . My mind is swollen with words , the path from my room to this spot littered with words I 've thrown out and the truth is untold . SAPPHO feeds the pieces of paper into the brazier ; they burn . Greedily , as if I sang with full throat , you lick up my slight thoughts . And the longing on which they barely touch , can you soothe that with your tongue-like flame ? From off-stage we hear ANACTORIA 's voice , singing . ANACTORIA " And I rise from the earth or am washed ashore by the sea . Salt is my smell ; honey my taste . Milk which is life I have brought . I have changed desire for death . . . " I wonder if I dare alter that line ? Well , there 's no one to hear . Sings . Milk which is life I have brought and I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters ; she bears an overflowing cornucopia , her gift to the goddess who has blessed her so richly with love . Sappho , I did n't see you ! p. 29 SAPPHO You have come singing Atthis 's song . Yet you altered a line . ANACTORIA It was too eery sad for my mood . SAPPHO " I have changed desire for death into sensations of love . " It is the death wish in Atthis I sought to change but could not . Never mind . You did well to come . ANACTORIA I woke at dawn . An expectant sense woke me up . What can I bring to her who has everything , I wondered out loud , and Atthis said , " Bring her the fruits of our love . " You see how literal-minded I am . SAPPHO Yes . I hunger and thirst . You come bearing fruits . ANACTORIA I brought them to lay at the door of the cave for I have been richly blessed . SAPPHO By Atthis , and by myself . ANACTORIA Sappho , you blessed me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so much . SAPPHO Were you called by my song ? A longing half-formed like the half-form of our love ? Can a need that gives birth to pale and wrong images make you believe in its truth ? ANACTORIA I was singing as I came . I did n't hear your song . p. 30 SAPPHO Can you think how bitter it is when hundreds of women once danced to your words not to be able to speak in a voice a single woman can hear ? ANACTORIA I was just passing by . I 'm wrestling with Atthis as soon as the sun warms the ground . SAPPHO See how my words fail me . I have not been able to sing since I put the goddess 's crown on your head . My words have lacked power since then . ANACTORIA I know . . . it 's whispered about . But , Sappho , it happens to everyone , does n't it ? Atthis says you have been silent before . SAPPHO Does she ? What else does she say ? ANACTORIA She says silence serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , you will . SAPPHO She has a gift for silencing . ANACTORIA She still calls your name in the night . SAPPHO She renews her curse under the moon . I would be cursed with coldness . An icy chill would silence me . Both of us could not live , she said , and from that day I have not sung . Like Timas , I am struck dumb . ANACTORIA Atthis cursed you from hurt . She wants you back . p. 31 SAPPHO Why ? She is Sappho now . She is the one who turns untouched girls into goddesses , rousing an immortal breath from inconstant flesh . Silence . Then , off-stage , we hear CLEIS singing one of SAPPHO 's old songs . She enters , half-intoxicated , bearing a cup of honey drink , an offering to Aphrodite . CLEIS You know the place : then Leave Crete and come to us waiting where the grove is pleasantest , by precincts sacred to you : incense smokes on the altar , cold streams murmur through the apple branches , a young rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep ; in meadows where horses have grown sleek among spring flowers , dill scents the air . Queen ! Cyprian ! fill my gold cup with love stirred into clear nectar.37 She sets the cup down and looks up . Ana ! What wonderful fruits . And look , I have strong honey drink borrowed from Sappho 's own store . Surely the goddess will smile on us . Ana , I 'm meeting him tonight ! ANACTORIA Cleis , shssh ! Sappho , I have to go . Atthis is waiting for me . Exits . CLEIS Mother ! What are you doing here ? SAPPHO You grow bold on my song and my drink but shrink from my sight . Have you become just like them ? Each one has eaten her fill , then turned in distaste from the used flesh . p. 32 CLEIS You 're out of sorts because your lovers are gone . But that 's not my fault . You could have had Ana for yourself if you 'd let me go when I asked . So I do n't care a fig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goddess will bless my love for a man . SAPPHO Gifts you were given at my knee . CLEIS Gifts that will set me free . CLEIS runs out . SAPPHO calling after CLEIS : Cleis , come back . Cleis , do n't let us fight . Begins to speak as if CLEIS were there . Come , sit with me . I will sing you a song in praise of your new womanhood . Come , we 'll pick dill and thyme , then weave the fresh shoots into your hair . We will enter the cave . We will stand on her lip and hear the sea 's roar . We will let the sound enter us . We will grow large with the sound . It was that way when you were born , that way when you pulled at my breast . The mystery you must relearn already roots in your flesh . Two hearts fatally bound become like the ocean 's breath , wakening first in one , then in the other , self . She looks in the direction CLEIS has gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you these things . Wanted . . . but that was long ago . . . when my words had force and want sometimes answered want . It is clear now Atthis 's curse cuts me deep . Wounded far worse than Timas was , Sappho speaks in a voice no one hears . Each one forgets the pull of my words . From such cruel forgetfulness Athena sprang fullborn from the head of Zeus , forgetting herself and all of us , forgetting the motherflesh . SAPPHO puts out the brazier light with her hands . Sappho is dead , dead to herself . A siren song called revenge lures Sappho 's corpse into hideous realms . SAPPHO exits . TIMAS and CLEIS enter ; they are wrestling . They are dressed in bright , scant clothes wound around their bodies . The two lock into a sitting position , facing each other , legs intertwined. p. 33 CLEIS Timas ! Shssh ! I 'm meeting him tonight ! He was so mad when I stood him up , it 's taken me weeks to win him back . CLEIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMAS . Timas ! He 's handsome and strong . He can pick me up with one hand and fling me around . But tonight he wo n't need to do that . CLEIS falls on top of TIMAS , moving her hips around . What does it feel like , the first time ? I wish you could talk ! Atthis gets angry whenever I ask . She 's just been with women , not once with a man . It 's not the same . What does she know about love ? TIMAS , angered and frightened for CLEIS , rolls over on top of her and pulls her up , then flips her over her back to the ground . Timas ! Why 'd you do that ? The mouth of the cave is right here . I almost fell in . I could have died . CLEIS gets up . My shoulder is hurt . CLEIS begins walking fast , rubbing her shoulder . TIMAS follows behind her , concerned , but CLEIS will take no comfort . Then , suddenly , she flops to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder , gently . ATTHIS and ANACTORIA appear , also wrestling . With them it is like a happy dance . They keep moving in and out of beautiful , sensuous poses , their bodies working in simple harmony . They seem perfectly matched . They 're awfully good . Remember how clumsy Anactoria was ? Of course , Sappho says you have to love someone well to wrestle her to the ground . I 'm so mad at her I could shriek . I want her to leave me alone . She ought to have let you wear the crown . You deserve a love of your own ! It serves Sappho right that Atthis took Ana away . TIMAS wraps her arms around CLEIS and lays her head on her shoulder . ANACTORIA and ATTHIS are panting hard , laughing , entwined together on the ground. p. 34 ANACTORIA pounding her hand on the ground : Finished . Done . Pinned to the ground . Up Atthis . Off of me now . ATTHIS Ca n't . ANACTORIA Are you stuck ? ATTHIS Caught at the core . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stopped . ANACTORIA Atthis , get off . I wo n't let you make love , even with words , if I ca n't move . ATTHIS raises herself up and ANACTORIA wriggles free under her , but the two are still entwined . ATTHIS Last night you straddled me and beamed with delight . " Atthis , " you cried , " I ca n't tell where I leave off and where you start . " And we rolled in the bed until we began the entire adventure again . " Atthis , " you said , as you rolled like the earth under my weight , " I am born from your touch . Born wholly awake and alive . " You fell asleep on my breast . Such tenderness overtook me then , I rose to a tender release as you lay sleeping there . ANACTORIA And you called Sappho 's name . ATTHIS I did not . ANACTORIA I woke to that sound . p. 35 ATTHIS You lay still . You dreamt your worst fear . ANACTORIA Or you in your revery spoke the wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't torture us . She kisses her . SAPPHO enters . ANACTORIA Sappho , hello . CLEIS decides to punish her mother in front of them all . SAPPHO is reserved , holding herself aloof . CLEIS But it looks like you 've missed the match . SAPPHO So I have . CLEIS Do you want to wrestle with me ? SAPPHO Can I decide ? CLEIS Of course . You decide everything else . SAPPHO I think you and I have wrestled enough these past weeks . CLEIS Perhaps Ana is more to your taste . ANACTORIA I 'm afraid I 'm worn out . CLEIS Aptly put , is n't it . Since you refuse Timas her due it means that Atthis is left . ATTHIS Yes , how familiar . But today I decline the honor . p. 36 CLEIS I guess you are out of luck . No one wants to feel your weight . SAPPHO It seems so , does n't it ? Luck is as fickle as a daughter 's love . Just when it seems at its height , it can vanish complete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fortune I have carried here . This letter from Sardis just came . I thought it worth-while to bring it direct , though it may interrupt the rest of the day you have planned . SAPPHO hands the letter to ATTHIS . ANACTORIA From Sardis ? Do I know who sent it ? SAPPHO You might know the name . ATTHIS lets out a happy shriek . ATTHIS My first commission has come ! I 'm to be paid for my work ! CLEIS and TIMAS jump with delight . ANACTORIA Atthis , that 's grand ! Can you put me into a verse and be paid for your happy choice ? ATTHIS No , silly goose , of course not . Poets never get paid to write what we want . Male poets get paid to write funeral laments for heroes dead in the wars or to sing praises of heroes victorious , while women are paid to write songs for the night other women are wed : to gravely lament the maiden-head 's death and praise the conquering love . p. 37 ANACTORIA Well , it helps your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money it brings . I 'll write some doggerel verse of the kind I 've helped Sappho write many times . Once for some groom especially pompous we even managed to sing our own praises . ATTHIS enacts both voices . FIRST VOICE Raise the rafters ! Hoist them higher ! Here comes the bridegroom taller than Ares ! SECOND VOICE Hymenaon ! As ATTHIS recites the second verse , CLEIS and TIMAS pick her up by the legs , so she grows taller . FIRST VOICE He towers above tall men as poets of Lesbos over all others ! SECOND VOICE Sing Hymen O Hymenaon. 29 ATTHIS Oh , we laughed hard making that up . He was short as a suckling pig , himself , but he was so pleased with our verse he sent us a bonus of two baskets of olives , four heads of cheese , and some fine Sardinian wine . We threw a feast that lasted three days . SAPPHO It 's also from Sardis that this commission has come . ANACTORIA taking the letter : Let me see who asked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write the rhyme ? You 'll have a share in whatever bonus is sent . Let 's pretend we have a thin groom and a fat bride ; then we sing of the width of the globe he has trod and of his ravenous love . CLEIS Sorry , Atthis , I have n't time . Timas , come . Will you perfume me after I 've bathed and find some fresh flowers for my hair ? SAPPHO Cleis , tonight you will study with me . CLEIS Catch me , if you can . She runs off ; TIMAS follows . SAPPHO Ana , you have n't long to learn what I teach . Will you come to my room when you finish here ? Since reading the letter , ANACTORIA has been standing silent . ATTHIS How dare you say that to her . Especially when everyone knows you are blocked . She ca n't be your muse . SAPPHO Perhaps not . But she has served well as yours . ATTHIS I 'm teaching her to write and to sing as well as you taught me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a year or two . SAPPHO I would know when to let her go . That 's all I knew with you . p. 39 ATTHIS You threw me away when I challenged you . Jealousy of my work was all you knew . SAPPHO If you are so safe from that fear , why wo n't you let her study with me ? ATTHIS Why should she drink at a well that is dry ? SAPPHO Thirst teaches us where water is . SAPPHO exits . ANACTORIA You are cruel to her . ATTHIS She with her tender tongue is cruel as a snake in the grass , hissing a song before she strikes . ANACTORIA You two have to make up . This is your home . I will have to go back to mine . ATTHIS covering ANACTORIA 's mouth with her hand : Hush , do n't even say such a thing . ANACTORIA I must , Atthis , because it 's the truth . I was sent here to learn pride in myself . " Enough pride for a lifetime of being a wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I have learned that . . . from you . But I 'll be gone in three months , less . I am betrothed , Atthis , you know that . ATTHIS So what ! Betrothed to someone you have seen once or twice shaking your father 's hand as they agreed on a price ! p. 40 ANACTORIA A noble man , and kind . ATTHIS So was the man who sent this commission to me . I met him at a contest last year . We smiled and spoke . He said he was taken with my verse and would like me to be better known . What if he wrote to propose , would I be so glad to be asked I would leave you without a thought ? ANACTORIA It 's not the same thing . ATTHIS Its exactly the same . How would you feel if I left you for a man ? ANACTORIA Atthis , he and I have the same taste . He has hired you to write our wedding verse . ATTHIS What a hideous joke . ANACTORIA Sappho knew it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name . ATTHIS grabs the letter from ANACTORIA 's hand and rips it up . ATTHIS Sappho did this ? ANACTORIA That wo n't help . I will leave to be wed and you could use the money your verses will bring . ATTHIS They would ban what I 'd write to the man who has stolen my love . ANACTORIA Atthis , please . . . I was betrothed before I came here . p. 41 ATTHIS Right , you 're rich so you 're told you must reproduce . I 'm poor . No one troubles me about making an heir . ANACTORIA But it happens this way all the time , does n't it ? Many girls come here to learn what you teach . But most of them leave to be wed . ATTHIS When I knelt at your feet and opened you up to yourself with my kiss and with my tongue let loose your silver life-giving milk , did you dare think you were simply receiving your due as someone who came to study metre and rhyme ? ANACTORIA Atthis , please , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lured me in , like that cave over there lures us down , when I felt your ruby wet self give form to each longing I have , do n't you think I sacrificed distance and fear on that altar of flesh ? ANACTORIA Atthis , please . . . What happened with us is n't a myth . ATTHIS What did you hear in that cave waiting to rise into my arms ? A man 's voice ? Did you promise yourself to him after you 'd learned how to love ? ANACTORIA I ca n't help what I hear . ATTHIS Yes you can . Listen to me . I am the one whose touch sings through your flesh . p. 42 ANACTORIA You ask for too much . It 's clear in each image you use . Sappho must have felt as I do . ATTHIS What did you hear in that cave ? Sappho 's voice laughing at me ? " Use her , " she screamed , " use her , then tighten and close like the parched ground to the root she sent down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torturing me . ATTHIS What did you hear ? I will know why you turn from this love . ANACTORIA But I do n't turn from you , if I wish to include something else . A man and children , perhaps ; we were made for all this . And I ca n't cut myself off . Atthis , listen to me ! In my dreams , a woman and a man both lie in my arms . Through me their worlds meet and because of them both I am whole . When the dream comes I feel like I felt when I stood alone in that cave , as if at the center point where compassion is infinite . ATTHIS Take me to Sardis with you . ANACTORIA You would suffocate . ATTHIS What air will you breathe ? Respectable talk , his business affairs , your children 's demands ? ANACTORIA You do n't understand . He is kind . p. 43 ATTHIS Have him come here . If he loves you , he can make his home here with us . ANACTORIA He could n't live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATTHIS He is more than a hero He is a god in my eyes  --  the man who is allowed to sit beside you  --  he who listens intimately to the sweet murmur of your voice , the enticing laughter that makes my own heart beat fast . . . ANACTORIA Atthis , this is unbearable , stop . ATTHIS It is Sappho 's verse . How well she understood the pain you have brought . If I meet you suddenly , I ca n't speak  --  my tongue is broken ; a thin flame runs under my skin ; seeing nothing , hearing only my own ears drumming , I drip with sweat ; trembling shakes my body and I turn paler than dry grass . At such times death is n't far from me. 39 Sappho knows , doe n't she ? Sappho knows what it means to be left . ANACTORIA Come , I will take you to her . ATTHIS Yes , take me to her . To her sitting stiff in her chair . You two can laugh at the creature who begged for your love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home . p. 44 ATTHIS I am going home to the cave . To the same sweet place you run from . To the cave opening up to the sea . I am called there by the sea 's shout as she slams her soft flesh into rock . I will follow the dark to that sound and dive from the rocks of the cave onto the rocks the sea hides . I will let the sea 's cold breath change desire to death . There is no comfort above where women lie of their love . The rank sweet fullness of death calls me down I will know consummation in her arms . ATTHIS rushes into the cave ; ANACTORIA watches her go , then leaves , running in search of SAPPHO . ANACTORIA Sappho ! TIMAS enters , starts to enter the cave , then hears CLEIS weeping and turns back to her . CLEIS Why am I crying ? Am I still sad because of my lost maidenhead ? 36 TIMAS begins to sing a wordless song , making the sounds in her throat to a poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words . CLEIS as TIMAS hums the music to this song : Like a quince-apple ripening on a top branch in a tree top not once noticed by harvesters or if not unnoticed , not reached Like a hyacinth in the mountains , trampled by shepherds until only a purple stain remains on the ground . 34 Timas , hush . Sappho 's song tells a part of the truth . It happened too fast . Then he left . Left me , I felt , with his soul awash in my flesh . What am I to do with his gift when I am so broken and changed I no longer know who I am ? TIMAS leads CLEIS to the rocks next to the cave . She comforts CLEIS in her arms . Silence . SAPPHO enters p. 45 SAPPHO Is she silent now ? Running , I thought I heard her call like the eager shy girl who once bade me come to her room . Then I stood silent a moment or two outside her door while she gathered courage to call me again and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and I will come . Call to me , call . I will lay my ear to your breast and drink up the great choral ode , half terror , half joy that echoed so long in our flesh . Call to me , call . SAPPHO begins to hear voices , as if in a nightmare : the voices of her conscience , accusing her of the murder she fears she has committed . She hears the angry , taunting voices of the women in her school ; especially , SAPPHO hears the voice of TIMAS . TIMAS Did you strangle that cry in her throat ? How can you bring her voice back , you who have strangled your own ? Your truth grew stonelike and dumb when you tore her out of your heart . CLEIS AND ANACTORIA Tore her out of your heart . Tore her out of your heart . TIMAS Sappho has silenced so much . You are too broken to sing in a voice full enough to call her back . CLEIS AND ANACTORIA Too broken to sing . TIMAS She is gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh swollen among the soft waves ? Will you gather her piece by piece from where she has shattered against the rock ? Sappho has killed what she loved . Death is the mask you have worn . Sappho the goddess of death . Death-like you enter the wound . Death-like go back to the spot where you stalked life . Circling SAPPHO while singing , TIMAS , ANACTORIA and CLEIS dress her in the death-gown , as she had dressed ANACTORIA as Aphrodite in Act I. SAPPHO enters the death-cave , where ATTHIS sees her as the figure of Death. p. 46 ATTHIS appearing from behind a cave wall I came alone to Death 's house . There Death is , bidding me come . How familiar it is ; how like the time I bowed to those other comforting arms . I had run from my mother 's cold house and stood cold with sweat on her step . " Come , " she said , leading me in . " Stand where the light wreaths your hair . Sing me this verse . Stop shifting about . Sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will make your home here with us . " What secret pulse will Death touch ? What song will I learn in Death 's arms ? DEATH Come , lovely child , you will grow whole in my house . ATTHIS Make me into the vision you have . DEATH Give what I ask . ATTHIS I am yours to do with as you wish . DEATH Give Death her fill from the center of self . Sorrow , first . Sorrow for what you are , for what you hoped to become . Sorrow for what is lost . Sorrow for all that is past . Here , in Death 's house , grief stops . Find sorrow where it lives and give that grieving flesh to me . Locked in DEATH 's embrace , ATTHIS emits a cry of sorrow . Anger next . You will come free into my world . Anger at her who gave you birth , give that bitter anger up . Anger at those who birthed you again in their love  --  let that gnawing anger go . Anger at those who betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a needy child . Give anger to me . ATTHIS struggles with DEATH ; she lets her anger out in a long cry . Fear . Fear of loss . Fear of being alone . Fear of all you betrayed . Fear of the cycle itself . Fear of Death . You will come open to me , unencumbered by fear . Put that stinking thing in my hand . ATTHIS is brought down to the ground by DEATH ; she gives a long , fearful cry. p. 47 DEATH Now desire must end . You must want nothing more . All is formless where you go . You can not inflict beauty or meaning on Death . Put the desire to craft and to make in my hand . ATTHIS struggles to free herself from DEATH . Give what I ask . ATTHIS I can not cut that ache out of my flesh . I do not know where it starts . DEATH I am ready to take you into my arms but can not unless you give desire up . ATTHIS wrenches away from Death and stands ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do ? What will you do if I take myself back ? Will you still be Death in your death-like mask , will you breathe death into my face ? Will you freeze my life with your stone-cold breath , wrap my life in your stone-cold arms ? If I refuse to do what you ask , what will become of Death ? DEATH We are one flesh , twinned by a singular need . Put the desire to craft and to make into my arms . You will rest . ATTHIS Mother-death , call me again , weave your spell one more time , your voice is growing weak . What will you save me from ? Desire , my own , to throw myself weeping into your arms . That is the one desire I disown . Let me take off your mask . p. 48 DEATH You can not see me plain . You have looked but have not seen . ATTHIS I will take off the mask that has kept you hidden from me . DEATH You wear that mask , not I. ATTHIS I faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will drop from yours . DEATH You will ruin the work of the cave . ATTHIS No . I complete the action begun . I no longer fear Death when I feast on the beloved . She lifts the mask from SAPPHO 's head . She looks into SAPPHO 's eyes . She feasts on SAPPHO 's face . Long ago , when bee-like I churned you to honey under my tongue , I saw your great composed face crack apart from pleasure 's strain . How fragile you seemed to me then . But I never dared speak of those times . I was afraid . I needed you to be strong . How fragile you seem to me now . Let me take off this gown . ATTHIS takes the death-gown off SAPPHO . SAPPHO Do you dare look into my face ? I am rotten with Death . ATTHIS We were both lost in her arms . SAPPHO I followed you here , followed you into this cave ; I would have become whatever you craved . p. 49 ATTHIS That you would come to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me as you are ; that I might have been strong while you lay in my arms and wept at the force of our bond . SAPPHO singing ATTHIS 's lines " We have changed desire for death into sensations of . . . " Have we soured the milk of our love ? ATTHIS We have mixed it with all that it lacked . CLEIS and TIMAS arrive , bearing a bowl of honey . CLEIS Mother , look ! I have drunk of the honey myself . It was wondrous strange . First I felt totally changed . Now I feel happy and free . I ca n't wait for tonight and the same sweet taste in my mouth . You two ought to dip in your tongues . It 's the most irresistible thing . Once you begin , you ca n't stop . ATTHIS Cleis , give me the bowl . You have grown skilled in its use ; still you might learn a bit if you watch . ATTHIS paints SAPPHO 's lips with the honey , and kisses her . The life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only ANACTORIA is not among the group . She is packing to return to Sardis . SAPPHO to ATTHIS , kissing her Come with me back to the light . I am fertile again and will sing what Ana cannot. p. 50 ANACTORIA With her bag on her arm she sings SAPPHO 's song
