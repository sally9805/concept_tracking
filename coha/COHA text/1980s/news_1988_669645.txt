For the most part we were dour and uncommunicative , as Scots can be , yet we did involve ourselves in village life , with kirk and school and conservation . Our fellow villager , Miss Aird , retired civil servant , held herself aloof , an outsider , almost an outcast . She gave the impression of wearing a placard saying : Do not disturb . No one even knew her first name . She might never have participated in our communal life had it not been for the great March storm. // This particular March came in like a lion . Before midnight we had lost hundreds of oaks , beeches , and elms , which lay straddled over fields and in the woodlands . Something else happened during the storm , as we were to hear , something that produced the extraordinary sight of Miss Aird ' s gaunt and angular figure stalking down the village street the morning after and knocking at the door of Sorley the schoolmaster , a bird watcher and ornithological expert . ' ' I have come to consult you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know how to deal with a broken wing. ' ' // // The story came out . She had been wakeful because of the howling and shrieking of the gale , when all at once , in a lull , she had heard a tiny scrabbling and persistent tapping at her bedroom window . Out there , huddled against the pane , was a bedraggled , storm-battered bird . She , who kept her door closed to all comers , had opened her window to an owl . She had taken it in and here she was now , asking Sorley ' s advice about how to splint a shattered wing and wondering what on earth owls had as their diet . Was it only mice , or would mince do as well ? // We began to find her almost approachable , with a dry , caustic sense of humor . We met her at the butcher ' s buying shredded meat , in the local library studying bird books ; and she even appeared at the schoolhouse with the owl in a basket to show Sorley how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn owl , she said . Her field guide described it as a long-legged , very pale bird with a white face . ' ' Its voice , ' ' she quoted , ' ' is a long , wild shriek ; hissing and snoring and yapping sounds also occur. ' ' // A group of schoolchildren had gathered round , listening with all their ears and staring at the owl . ' ' Hissing , snoring , and yapping ! ' ' one boy said with a sly snigger . ' ' Just like Allie . ' ' It was true . In our village was another outcast , a backward boy of 7 . Miss Aird had not wished to talk to us ; Allie couldn ' t . All that came from him was a sort of gibberish . We could make nothing of it or of him . The most we ever said to him was an awkward ' ' Hullo , Allie ! ' ' // We certainly didn ' t foresee that Miss Aird , who knew nothing about children , would have a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the principle of a pebble dropped in a pool , spreading circles , one surprise led us on to another , jolting us , discomfited , out of our mold. // The first time Allie caught sight of Miss Aird with the owl perched on her shoulder , the oddest look came over his face . ' ' Come and see my bird , ' ' she called to him in what we thought of as her civil service voice . ' ' Say owl , ' ' she went on . He stared from her to the owl with growing wonder . He couldn ' t bring out the word , and she didn ' t insist . He shuffled off , mouthing something . ' ' Well , that ' s an end of that , ' ' someone said . ' ' Rather a beginning , ' ' Miss Aird retorted sharply . It was indeed impossible to forget the expression that had transformed the boy ' s face , as if some hidden chord in him had been stirred. // AFTER that encounter , Allie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s door . We had never considered that his strange mutterings might indicate a desperate struggle to express himself . She had . She didn ' t talk down to him , but spoke as to an equal , slowly , in her precise way . ' ' Touch the owl , Allie , ' ' she said . ' ' He won ' t peck you . ' ' Cautiously he put forward a finger , withdrew it , hesitated , then gently stroked the downy feathers . Encouraged by so much boldness , he let out a funny half squeak , half squeal . ' ' Now say owl , ' ' she ordered him again . ' ' How - ow-howl , ' ' he began , then , in a sudden burst , out it came : ' ' Owl ! ' ' The bird leaned forward , its dark eyes flickering , and gave a squawk . ' ' There ' s the owl talking to you , ' ' she said . ' ' Howl - owl , ' ' Allie repeated , over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy it was as if the owl had found an affinity with the only one who could talk to it in its own language : Hoo , hoo , ow - owl . Allie flapped his arms , imitating the bird , and gave gurglings and chuckling whoops as he watched it go hopping and fluttering across the lawn and through the shrubbery , tumbling , scuttering , scrabbling comically , almost clownishly. // ' ' Hear that ! ' ' we exclaimed at an incredible mirthful sound - it was Allie laughing . There ' s something ' ' normal ' ' about him after all , we said . Then , following a further , disconcerting train of thought , we wondered : What is normal ? Are we so normal ourselves ? Who are we to judge , anyway ? // March went out , the last snows melted , April filled our gardens with aconites and crocuses , there was a perfume of lilacs , flowering hawthorn and mossy earth in the air , birds singing from dawn to dusk . The owl fluttered his wings more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that enigmatic tawny-amber stare ? What was he hearing as he tilted his head , listening ? What was stirring in him in answer to the continuous calls from his own kind among the larch trees ? // One shimmering green-gold evening in May , the owl was more restless than ever , making little runs and hops . We didn ' t see it happen , but some of us heard the boy cry out , ' ' Howl - owl ! ' ' in a wail of desolation that we would never forget . The owl had spread out its wings , then , after a moment ' s wavering , a swirling and flapping , went flitting up and up into the leafiness of spring and was gone. // Allie stood gazing up into the trees , tears rolling down his cheeks . Miss Aird put her arms round him with brusque kindliness . She knew , as we did not , how to comfort him . ' ' Our owl may not return , ' ' she said . ' ' He ' s back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other birds will come . You ' ll have robins and finches , thrushes , linties , and blackbirds as friends . We may even sometimes see our own owl up there in the branches. ' ' // Whenever we hear night birds call around our village we are reminded that it took a civil servant spinster , a lonely and neglected boy , and an owl to bring us to an agonizing reappraisal of the role we had played in these various interlinked events . It was not one to be proud of . We had never made any real attempt to draw out Miss Aird or break down her reserve , had never once tried to communicate with Allie . We knew nothing of the art of communication . While we remained earthbound , the pair of them had soared . Not only owls have wings. // //
