Throughout its 57-year history , Mexico 's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( P.R.I. ) has never lost a single gubernatorial or presidential election . Indeed , the country 's one-party democracy has generally been popular so long as Mexico prospered . At present , however , the country is far from prosperous : its foreign debt will soon top $100 billion , and last winter 's plunge in oil prices stripped the government of a third of its projected annual foreign exchange of $24.5 billion . The economic turmoil has put unprecedented pressure on the political system . Thus Mexicans and foreigners alike were paying close attention to last week 's elections in Chihuahua , the country 's largest state , where the conservative opposition National Action Party ( P.A.N. ) enjoys a considerable following . At issue : whether the P.R.I . would maintain its stranglehold on power by means fair or foul . <P> The answer was not long in coming . By 2 p.m. on voting day , Colude , a nonpartisan civic group that monitored the election , reported that P.A.N . poll watchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by impostors who beat them to the job in 21 others . Observers also said that ballot boxes had been stuffed with P.R.I . votes in 54 districts and stolen in four others . Hardly had the polls closed when the ruling party announced a sweeping victory in all but one of 67 contested municipalities . " What can you say ? " said one Reagan Administration official of the blatant fraud . " It was business as usual . " <P> However routine , the surprising landslide enraged many P.A.N . supporters . Stores across the state closed down for a day , and nearly 10,000 people gathered in the city of Chihuahua 's main plaza while Francisco Barrio , P.A.N . ' s candidate for governor , urged them to block roads and boycott progovernment newspapers . <P> The questionable election result was a blow to President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado 's vaunted campaign of " moral renovation . " In 1983 , De la Madrid 's first year in power , Mexico enjoyed rare fraud-free elections . P.A.N . won mayorships in all of the seven largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let such a calamity recur . Last year the ruling party resorted to flagrant irregularities while securing victory in elections in two northern states ; in December it changed Chihuahua 's laws so that the preparation and tallying of votes would be undertaken by P.R.I . agents . Such practices , however , may prove hard to manage . " The events in Chihuahua may pass with no major disturbance , " said one P.A.N . official . " But we will have elections for years to come . The government can thwart the popular will two times , three times , even ten times . But sooner or later , the people will explode . "
