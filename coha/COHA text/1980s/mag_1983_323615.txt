Despite a skillful pilot , 23 die in a jetliner blaze <P> The Air Canada DC-9 was approximately 25 miles northwest of Cincinnati when controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration center in Indianapolis heard the pilot 's calmly spoken words : " I have a fire on board . " It was shortly after 7 p.m . Thursday , and Flight 797 , carrying 41 passengers and a crew of five from Dallas and Fort Worth to Toronto , had smoke creeping forward through the cabin from a rear lavatory . <P> Air space was quickly cleared for the jetliner to land at the nearest airport , Greater Cincinnati International in Covington , Ky . In the 17 minutes it took to reach the runway , the crew shepherded passengers to the front of the 101-seat plane ; some on board held napkins and wet cloths to their faces against the choking fumes . By the time of touchdown , so much smoke had filled the cockpit that Pilot Don Cameron could not see his controls . <P> On landing , four tires blew out as the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halt , the forward passenger door flew open , sucking in oxygen and releasing smoke . Though well prepared by the crew for emergency evacuation , passengers had barely 30 seconds to slide down rubber emergency chutes and run 100 ft. before the fuselage erupted in flames . Said one survivor : " Five minutes before landing , we could n't see anything in the plane for the smoke . It was the kind of situation where you expect someone to scream , but no one did . " <P> Despite the crew 's best efforts , 23 passengers , some of them still in their seats , were found dead after the blaze was extinguished by 19 pieces of fire equipment surrounding the plane . It was the first loss of life in a commercial airline accident since Jan. 11 , when three crew members of a United Airlines cargo jet were killed when it crashed into a swamp near Detroit just after takeoff . Among those who perished were Curtis Mathes Jr. , 54 , chairman of Curtis Mathes Corp. , a Dallas television manufacturing firm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how the fire started and generated such acrid smoke through the DC-9 began to arise even as a makeshift morgue was set up at the airport to identify the bodies , some of which were badly charred . A team from the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) , the FAA and the FBI arrived to sift through the ruins of the plane for clues . NTSB officials suspect that the fire may have been started by a cigarette in a back-cabin lavatory . In Washington , aviation officials debated once again whether more stringent regulations regarding fire-resistant materials inside jetliners should be imposed . The disaster was likely to put pressure on the FAA to formulate a fire-prevention policy for airline cabins . ?
