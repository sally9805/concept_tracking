The people of the Monongahela River valley around Pittsburgh are not , as some journalistic reports about them have suggested . the " new poor . " That term misses the poignance and ambivalence of the present moment for them . They are , they told me over and over , " middle class . " " We pay the taxes and take care of the kids and go out for beer and pizza . We 're middle class , " a steelworker 's wife insisted . Or , as Douglas Fraser of the Auto Workers has put it , they are " working people of the middle class , " a sociological contradiction and a psychological reality in a country where the working class exists but will not say its own name . That is ironic in a physical and social setting that all but shouts the name . The landscape of the place is Appalachian , with ridges and hollows , but the industrial geography is the Ruhr or Wales . Mills hulk along the valley floor in the center of grimy towns like Homestead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills . One can see the ethnicitywith the naked eye , the onion spires of a Greek Orthodox church , the Slovak inscription on a school . Everything about the place asserts its working-class character except the workers . In the early years of the century , unskilled workers got 51.98 for a twelve-hour day . Last year , one unemployed activist told me , he made almost $30,000 . But that gain is what makes the current situation such a wrenching experience . It shatters an identity forged in the course of many struggles . The lawyer-doctor-managerial middle class did not have to shoot it out with the Pinkertons to get into the country club ; but these " working people of the middle class " had to fight , and even die , to win beer and pizza and the possibility that their children could go to college and escape from these valleys . Now that dream is in tatters and the dreamers are suddenly looking into a social abyss . Michael Harrington , author of The Other America ( 1964 ) , is working on a new book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a photojournalist who lives in New York City and contributes to many publications . Beached Whale Homestead is the mill town where the strikers defeated the Pinkertons in a bloody battle in 1892 , and where the steelworkers proclaimed their own declaration of independence on July 5 , 1936 , during the glory days of the legendary Steelworkers Organizing Committee . Now the Jones &; Laughlin steel plant , two miles downstream at Hazelwood , lies dead along the river like a beached whale . In the past , studies of people pushed out of the auto , steel , and meat-packing industries show , the workers have indeed found new jobs ? jobs that pay about half of what they were making before . If that were to happen throughout the United States , the unemployment percentages would decline and President Reagan could claim victory . But the new equilibrium would be a lower wage , nonunion equilibrium , and that would mean , even with economic recovery , a reduced market for all kinds of consumer goods . Anyway , those studies of the past are n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employment in the steel industry declined by about 100,000 jobs , roughly 20 percent . That process of two decades of attrition was nothing like the ubiquitous , sudden shutdowns that have occurred in the last two or three years . Can hundreds of thousands of people , some in their late forties or early fifties , find new jobs when they 're all dumped on the market simultaneously ? After I got back from the Mon Valley , I chatted with an Ohio organizer who had been active in Pgrf Youngstown , where the disaster hit much earlier than it did in Pennsylvania . After the first wave of layoffs in the 1970s , she said , a fair number of young workers did find new jobs , some even in the steel industry . But with the more recently unemployed the situation is completely different . Some of the mills are being physically dismantled ? which is happening in the Pittsburgh area too ? and it becomes hard to believe that there ever will he work in steel again . " In commonsense terms , " Henry Myers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American workers have simply priced themselves out of the market , - American workers have been wrongly indicted for creating their own miseries . From 1969 to 1978 , an Office of Technology Assessment study of the steel industry reported three years ago , 49 " foreign hourly employment costs ( in dollars ) rose 1 1/2 to 3 times faster than in the United States . As a result , U.S. unit labor costs moved from highest to the second lowest .... " If you count the social , rather than the individual , wages of foreign workers ? the value of their national health care , government child allowances , longer paid holidays , etc. ? the cost of the American worker shrinks still further . And the crisis in the steel industry is not the result of excessive environmentalism either . From 1971 to 1977 , that government study documents , Japanese capital costs for environmental compliance were 65 percent higher than American costs . The analysis of the situation by most of the steelworkers I talked to was considerably more sophisticated than that of the Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were opposed to the concessions agreed to by the international leadership of the Steelworkers Union and then rejected by the presidents of the steel locals . Were they , then , obdurate , intransigent , shortsighted ? In no way . They were willing to make enormous concessions in pay and fringe benefits if , but only if , the companies agreed to invest the money thus saved in the Mon Valley . Why , they asked me , should they give up hard-earned benefits in order to finance another U.S. Steel multibillion-dollar takeover of an oil company , a move that followed on the announcement that U.S. Steel would not build a new plant in Ohio ? The fact is , American steel has been a mismanaged , technologically backward industry , paying high dividends and engaging in takeovers while allowing 25 percent of its plant to become obsolete . But the steelworkers have been blamed for the stupidities of the front office . Besides being unjust , this has subverted the moral basis of the political movement of the unemployed . The Mon Valley Committee had arranged for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who had been forced to get Aid to Families with Dependent Children when her husband ( a supervisor , not a production worker ) had lost his job I feared I had a rendezvous with a cliche . But the house was a neat little structure on a well-kept block with a reassuring church on the corner . Mrs. Flo Walters turned out to be a striking , articulate young woman who had even done some modeling . Her marriage was intact . Pennsylvania is one of the few states where you do n't have to break up your home to qualify for AFDC . She admitted that she had done some hard drinking when the catastrophe hit , but that episode seemed to be over . Her five children , three of whom are shown here with her , were bright and attractive . This picture , posed in front of their house , looks as if it ought to be captioned , " Triumph of the black middle class . " ( Mr. Walters is inside ? he did n't want to be photographed . ) But inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity agency , there had been no presents at Christmas , the utilities had been off for a while , and the bank had almost foreclosed on the mortgage . ( The Mon Valley Committee had helped save the house . ) But it is too early to say that even this family , which ( unlike most in the valley ) is indeed receiving welfare , is part of the " new poor . " If the economy were to turn hack up in McKeesport , the Walters would return to being " middle class " with no trouble . If things do n't get better , they will continue to slip into poverty . At the moment , they are part of a whole new stratum of people in sociological limbo . HARPER'S/APRIL 1983 Joe Reed , shown here with his son Joey , age fifteen months , and bags of groceries supplied by the Steelworkers Union local , was laid off over a year ago by the Edgar Thomson Works of the United States Steel Company ( in the background ) . It happens that most of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley were white . But their attitudes have to do with social class , not race . A few years ago , I had an encounter with some men very much like the steelworkers of the Monongahela Valley , except that they were black . Auto workers in Saint Louis , they had been out on the street for over a year and were part of an unemployed committee of the UAW . They told me they had all known that people on welfare were lazy and irresponsible . Only now they were learning in a most bitter way that it was not necessarily shirking that kept people from work . I suspect that the psychological shock of prolonged ? seemingly endless ? unemployment may be greater among whites than among blacks . Black workers , however strong their own " middle class " values , come from a world where things like Aid to Families with Dependent Children are commonplace . Some years ago , when strikers could still qualify for food stamps in New York , the blacks in one union had to teach the whites how to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that the white workers may now be victimized by whatever racism infects them . When they now have to contemplate Medicaid and food stamps , and even AFDC , that means that they are becoming , in their own terms , black . Three food Mies demonstrate the different styles of help and self-help going on in the Mon Valley . The Intersection is a center run by Irish-Catholic nuns in space they 've leased in the basement of a Hungarian Protestant church . The woman in the picture , who works as a volunteer at the Intersection , is a third-generation mill hand and now a second-generation unemployed worker . Her father has been laid off despite thirty years ' seniority . One of the two nuns dispensing lunch . Sister Peg , told me , " We started out being a Catholic center , but then Protestants came to help and we said the project was Christian . Then Jews came and we said it was Judeo-Christian , and finally atheists pitched in and we did n't use labels anymore . " The YWCA is an incongruously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving cauldrons of real soup , and there were few takerson the first day it was open . Admission was supposed to depend on a union card . But people with union cards do n't want to be told they are at a " Depression style " soup kitchen . The woman in charge said they were thinking of changing the name . Things were more upbeat at the Steelworkers Union local near the Edgar Thomson works in Braddock , where men and women walked briskly down a line picking up paper bags of food ( impressively bulky from the outside ? but not too full ) . The local joins the Mon Valley Committee and others to do this twice a month in order to supplement the diets of unemployed workers . At Christmas there were turkeys for all . At first , I was told , two hundred showed up ; then four hundred ; recently a thousand . The mood , surprisingly , was social and lighthearted . The food line had become a break in the endless routine of waiting for the plants to reopen , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity ; the union , not the government , or even the Y. 52 The Committee The Mon Valley Unemployed Committee has an office on the third floor of a building near downtown McKeesport . The building also houses what 's left of McKeesport 's antipoverty agency , following the Reagan budget cuts , and the atmosphere is I rather gloomy . But the third floor brims with energy , like every " movement " headquarters in the first phase of a difficult but exhilarating struggle . The organizers have all worked in the mills . But most of them are atypical , having been involved in some kind of movement work before . They had begun as a committee within the United Steelworkers. where many of them had opposed union concessions to management , but now they have broadened their base to include all of the unemployed . Though some of these people are veterans of earlier battles , the mood is not at all that of the sectarian Left . One of the militants without a radical background ? an Irish Democrat and proud of it ? explained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of philosophy but you had to keep both out of the day-to-day work . Homes and Families The Mon Valley Committee has had its greatest success in organizing and getting media attention over the issue of defending homeownership . Joan McHenry and her husband , Bill , a laid-off steelworker , own a pleasant house in West Mifflin , where they live with their children , Laura , age ten , and Michelle , age seven . The fact that many unemployed Mon Valley workers own their homes is one of the main ways they do n't fit the stereotype of the " new poor , " and they cling to homeownership as the tangible symbol of their middle-class status . But , ironically , the equity they have built up in their homes leaves them worse off financially , in some ways , than the traditional poor , because it disqualifies them for means-tested welfare benefits such as food stamps . Hence the privately sponsored food lines . Even if these families could bring themselves to sell their homes , the prices the houses would fetch in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment , probably would not even cover the mortgages , let alone return any cash to the owners . But , in another irony , the banks that hold these mortgages do not face the.same problem , because mortgages purchased under . federal programs such as VA and FHA , as most of these were , are guaranteed by the government . When laid-off workers could not meet their mortgage payments , the banks could foreclose and put the houses on the market , knowing that the Feds would make up the difference between the sale price and the amount they were owed . And it became possible to speculate on misery by picking up houses cheap at the sheriff 's sale . The Mon Valley Unemployed Committee dubbed the speculators " vultures " and took to showing up at the sheriff 's sales to make a great commotion . Eventually this persuaded the sheriff ( who is Punning for county commissioner at present ) to refuse to go on with this unpopular process . His decision was supported by a sympathetic judge ( who , at present , is running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these workers are homeowners makes it difficult for them to take the advice of a lot of commentators and pull up stakes to look for work elsewhere . So people stay and try to hang on . When the unemployment benefits run out . a lot of families manage to survive because the wife is able to find a job in a fast-food place or some other low-wage operation in the service sector . Not too long ago , some of the thinkers at the Brookings Institution discovered that America 's unemployment problems were , in some large measure , the fault of all those women who rushed into the labor market in the 1960s and 1970s . The unstated assumption of that Brookings argument was that frivolous females pursuing mad money were displacing serious breadwinners . The fact ? among the steelworkers in the Monongahela Valley and almost everywhere else ? is that those women are the reason why the Great Recession has not turned into the Great Depression . But even if a wife working at McDonald 's manages to put bread on the table , another terror looms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears you encounter among the steelworkers in McKeesport . When they lose their jobs , they also lose health insurance coverage for themselves and their families ( something the nonunion jobs at McDonald 's do not provide ) . So , one mother at the Mon Valley office said . one simply postpones a trip to the doctor . That can work as long as there is no medical emergency ? although the health cost of decreased routine care will be paid later on when preventable diseases occur because they were not caught in time . But what do you do in an emergency ? In order to qualify for Medicaid , like food stamps , you have to be officially , statistically poor . But precisely because these working people of the middle class have managed to achieve some equity in their house ? or because they have a car that is worth more than a certain ( low ) sum ? they can not be officially poor , even if they ca n't afford health care . America , Will Rogers said in the 1930s , is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile . To which we may now add , the only nation in the world where homeownership disqualifies people for medical care . Middle-Class People of the Middle Class Most of the 700 or so who assembled in the First United Methodist Church of McKeesport one January night were professional and commercial types . They have not lost their jobs yet . but they are hurting , as their patients , clients , and customers disappear , The program opened with four fervent verses of " A Mighty Fortress Is Our God . " The fourth verse thunders : " If they take our house , / Goods , fame , child or spouse , / Wrench our life away , / They can not win the day , / The Kingdom 's ours forever ! " a faith that is being sorely tested in these parts . I also went to hear three representatives of the Mon Valley Unemployed Committee discuss their campaign against mortgage foreclosures at a local television station . Two of the participants were laid-off steelworkers ( one white and one black ) , but the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bought a house , and then been fired . He found himself in the same boat as the unionists and became an active member of the committee . Until now , " unemployment " has been thought of as a blue-collar phenomenon . Perhaps that old pattern is changing too . America has an overabundance not just of obsolete steel mills , but of college graduates , at least relative to the number of jobs requiring a college degree . Because of this , one scholar , Stephen Dresch , told Congress , " In a traumatic reversal of historic experience , children born to persons achieving adulthood in the 1950s and 1960s will , on average , experience relatively lower status than their parents . " Upward social mobility has been , in theory and even in practice , the American answer to the problem of inequality . Even when there was no change in social position , a growing national product made it possible for almost everyone to make some gains . The people in McKeesport and throughout " smokestack " America -- - " working people of the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer holds . But what if middle-class people of the middle class ? those who had been confidently heading for the professions and executive suites make the same bitter discovery ? Short-ly after I returned from McKeesport , I was interviewed by an editor at Business Week who was working on a story about the " squashing " of the corporate pyramid ? the possibility that computers will make many middle managers superfluous . Would that provide the basis for a new alliance between the dispossessed working people of the middle class and the middle-class people of the middle class ? The real middle class would be foolish to observe these events as if they were a play staged by working people . The social insecurity of these times is going to hit the suburbs as well as the mill towns . We , dear reader , are " they " ; our slope is getting more slippery by the day .
