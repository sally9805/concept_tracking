Outdoor movie theaters are victims of TV and changing habits <P> Hula-Hoops . Frisbees . Drag races . The pizza parlor . One or more of these images will bring back the summers of their adolescence for many Americans who grew up in the ' 50s or early ' 60s . For others , however , one phrase says it all : the drive-in . They probably had their first date in a 1957 gas guzzler , with wraparound windows and sharklike tailfins , where they learned that sex is not just a three-letter word . But now , a mere 50 years after the first one opened in Camden , N.J. , the drive-in is an endangered institution ; in much of the U.S. it may not survive the end of the decade . " They 're obsolete , " says Historian Oscar Handlin , who teaches a course in popular culture at Harvard . " Their decline is a sign that a certain stage in American life is over . " <P> Drive-ins made their biggest gains in the years following World War II , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They hit their peak in 1958 , with 4,063 outdoor screens- " ozoners , " as they were called in the trade . To attract young families , some operators set up playgrounds and offered warm milk , fresh diapers and even laundry facilities , so Mom could do the family wash while watching Mamie Van Doren undulate through High School Confidential . Since then the number of drive-ins has dropped dramatically . By 1980 there were only 3,504 screens ; last year the total dropped to 3,178 , and there are only 2,935 in 1983 . <P> It seems that almost everyone and everything is conspiring to finish them off . One villain is rising real estate values , which make all that asphalt-covered acreage too expensive to use only at night ; a shopping center or housing development can be more profitable . Another culprit is cable TV , particularly the first-run films shown on such pay systems as HBO and Showtime . One of the major appeals of the drive-in was that the whole family , from Grandpa to Baby Sis , could pile into a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see a double feature surrounded by most of the comforts of home . Now they can see the same kind of films without even leaving home . A third conspirator : the movie companies , which often demand longer runs than many drive-ins can guarantee . " We do n't have any major regard for drive-ins because they 're such a small percentage of our profits , " declares Sidney Ganis , vice president in charge of marketing for Lucasfilm Ltd . <P> Most damaging of all is changing sexual mores . Way Back When-any time before the sexual revolution of the ' 60s and ' 70s-drive-ins were " the only place to go for some privacy , " recalls Manhattanite Vicki Slate , 40 . " We certainly could n't go to his house or my house . Our parents would have killed us ! " According to the quaint ritual of the time , families would park in the front rows , teen-agers who were just dating would take up the middle rows , and those who were bent on serious petting would head for the darker areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding privacy and are less likely to need the excuse of going to the movies .
