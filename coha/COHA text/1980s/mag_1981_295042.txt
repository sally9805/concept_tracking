A movie actor , an insurance man and other U.S. ambassadors <P> He speaks Spanish , rides horses and has had leading roles in such films as Psycho , Spartacus and Romanoff and Juliet . He is also an acquaintance of Ronald Reagan 's . It is not difficult to guess which of those qualities makes him the Reagan Administration 's most probable choice as the new U.S. Ambassador to Mexico . While nothing official has been announced , John Gavin , 52 , apparently feels so sure of the appointment that he quit the cast of the musical Can-Can , which has been in rehearsal for a Broadway opening next month . But if he gets the nod , it will take all of Gavin 's stage and screen skills to warm up a hostile audience awaiting him south of the border . <P> Though Gavin wrote his senior thesis at Stanford University on the economic history of Latin America , many Mexicans are irked that Reagan would send them an actor . To make matters worse , Gavin had given a speech in Los Angeles last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called farming in Mexico " a disaster . " The newspaper printed that he also attacked the country 's ejidos , a system of government-owned farm cooperatives , as " inefficient " and " existing solely for political purposes . " <P> Officials of the nation 's dominant political party assailed Gavin 's views . Faustino Alva Zavala , acting head of Mexico 's organized labor movement , said that the remarks " showed little tact and demonstrated hardly any diplomacy . " But according to the text of the Gavin speech , his strongest comment was that " agriculture is not flourishing " in Mexico . The Mexican government , which could in effect veto the Gavin appointment , has not commented officially on the nomination . <P> The fuss over Gavin illustrates the dangers in the practice of all recent Administrations to reserve some diplomatic posts for political fund raisers and friends . Of the 100 or so new ambassadors Reagan will have an opportunity to name , none had been chosen before last week . Reagan had picked California Real Estate Magnate William A. Wilson , 66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonambassadorial post . He had also asked former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield , 78 , a Carter appointee , to stay on as Ambassador to Japan . A number of career foreign service officers will also stay on . Many of the career posts are in such sensitive spots as Warsaw , Cairo and Tel Aviv , where experienced diplomats are required , or in posts like Kabul or Lilongwe , which few presidential friends covet . Yet for the 30 or so ambassadorships to friendly nations where the living is good-Britain , The Netherlands , Switzerland , Luxembourg and the like-a wealthy American who likes to entertain is acceptable .
