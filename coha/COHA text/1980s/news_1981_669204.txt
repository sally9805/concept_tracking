It is not , however , an emphasis which all Marxists greet with equal enthusiasm . To some it is seen as a way to reject the scientific character of Marxism , to downgrade the importance of the dialectic and what it is supposed to tell us about the course of human history and future events. // This seemingly academic issue has been the source of a bitter 12-year conflict in Yugoslavia which has resulted in the dismissal of seven of that country ' s most eminent philosophy professors , all from the University of Belgrade. // The situation is complex . However , it concerns the role of worker-management and control of factories and other work places , the privileged position of the communist bureaucracy , and the sporadic resurgence of sectional nationalism . Another important feature is the uneven economic development that has occurred in a country that was formed by fusing together a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire with a part of the old Ottoman Turkish empire. // The conflict in Yugoslavia does not have the high drama of Iran , Korea , El Salvador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the slow yet relentless methods that a bureaucracy can use to stifle dissent . The parties to the conflict involve not only the faculty of one of the country ' s major universities but trade union members , local officials , and national officers , including the late President Tito himself . The fact that Yugoslavia is itself a society twice born in revolution and dissent ( first against the Germans , and then against the domination of the Soviets ) adds a tragic irony to the episode. // Yugoslavia has always been a society that takes its intellectuals seriously . During World War II and immediately after , cadres of young , spirited revolutionary intellectuals were sent into the rural areas to explain the cause of the resistance and the ideals of the new society to the peasants . One member of such a cadre was Mihailo Markovic . Markovic was also a partisan fighter under Tito , and his career is but one example of the commitment that he and his colleagues have to Yugoslavia. // Yet Markovic and six of his colleagues on the faculty of philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research positions . Markovic ' s passport was confiscated and his freedom to travel lost. // All this followed a series of events that changed the structure of the governance of Yugoslavia universities and , in the opinion of many , violated the federal Yugoslavia and local Serbian constitutions. // The conflict can be traced back to 1964 when the philosophical journal Praxis was started as an instrument of " humanistic Marxism " to address issues in Marxist philosophy and problems in Yugoslav society . The journal was critical of various features of Yugoslav society : the special privilege of the party , the development of a managerial elite which was seen as usurping the decisonmaking prerogatives of workers , and the uneven development of different segments and regions of Yugoslav society . Some contributors were also troubled by the fact that planning on the national level did not allow for democratic participation , and that market considerations had replaced concerns of equity in decisions about the production and distribution of goods . During the early years Praxis was officially tolerated by the party . But this fortunate period began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1968. // While the Western countries were having their own problems with student protests in France , the United States and elsewhere , they had little time to notice that similar events were taking place in Yugoslavia . However , protests in that country were so severe ( the University of Belgrade was closed for seven days ) that President Tito was forced to appear on national television and concede the justness of the student demands for reform . He promised to rectify the problems or to resign . However , the problems were not rectified and Tito did not resign . Four years later , again through the national media , Tito focused attention on the Belgrade group to the teachings of Marx , Tito charged that students were no longer being taught the basic principles of Marxist philosophy . With this cry for " a return to the basics , " party officials in Serbia began to seek the removal of the seven professors from their posts. // At this point the government escalated the conflict by altering the long standing self-governing structure of the university . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their teaching responsibilities in January of 1975 . They were allowed to continue their research and to retain their salaries , but without any increase from the 1974 level. // All official means for them to influence scholarship and opinion within the country were closed . However , the seven continued to have an impact outside of the country , their situation has been closely monitored by concerned scholars throughout the West , and major academic associations have protested it. // Within the last few years , a new journal , Praxis International , has been established. it is to be published in Oxford , England , with Markovic as one of the two senior editors and vigorous Yugoslav participation . But the removal of the seven from their research positions and the restrictions placed on Markovic ' s travel have raised great concern about the level of Yugoslav participation. // Many conservatives who tend to see communism as a monolith , ever encroaching upon the freedom of the West , have come to admire the fierce courage and independence of Yugoslavia and its people . For the radical left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialism and an alternative to many of the disturbing features of Soviet society . Yet events in the ecademy cast an unfortunate shadow on the special place occupied by Yugoslavia , and one can only hope that that country , born in dissent , will not continue to deny this very right of free expression to its own citizens. // //
