 | Hollywood lies to the south , a half-hour flight by private plane . Farther up the coast looms San Simeon , where William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies threw their legendary movie parties . Here , in a canyon outside of Santa Barbara , John Travolta sits in the Spanish-style living room of his own Xanadu : a fivebedroom hacienda surrounded by 17 acres of paradisiacal real estate , dotted with lemon groves and avocado trees . Bougainvillea drapes the garage where he parks his Jaguar XJ-12 ( or , on other occasions , his ' 55 T-Bird , his van or his Mercedes ) . A fountain gurgles in the courtyard that leads down to the swimming pool and a murky , carp-infested pond . Fame attracts fame : James Cagney and Muhammad Ali , Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden have come up for weekends , retiring after dinner to Travolta 's self-designed screening room behind the house , just off the tennis court . Travolta lights a cigar ( a newly acquired habit ) as a silent Mexican servant lights the standing candelabras while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house for my guests , " he says . " I mean , it 's for me but it only works if my family and friends enjoy it . All this stuff ? success , all that ? it 's only good when you can share it . " They may be cliches , but they are spoken with the soft-voiced sincerity of a 26-year-old movie star who has not yet learned that they are cliches . One believes him . The sensitive young man with the two-day stubble is no Citizen Travolta . He is at one moment a kid with a passion for acting , airplanes and Scientology , at another a man grappling with the pressures of sudden wealth , power and celebrity , and at heart a serious actor just beginning to learn his most demanding role : John Travolta , superstar . @#  | Americans are as quick to worship celebrity as to trash it . We exalt youth yet turn on those who make it too big , too young , too fast . Travolta is well acquainted with fame 's double-edged spoils . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idol as Vinnie Barbarino on TV 's " Welcome Back , Kotter , " swaggered into the 2001 disco in " Saturday Night Fever " and boogied his way into instant , international stardom . Six months later , " Grease " opened and the kid from Englewood , N.J. , already had two of the most successful movies of all time behind him . Then came " Moment by Moment , " a May-December romance with Lily Tomlin . It was a feeble , misconceived movie and a commercial flop , but the media , sniffing blood , responded as if it were the second Guyana massacre . Only a year after his phenomenal starring debut ? a year in which he garnered an Oscar nomination , set the trends in disco fashions , graced the covers of dozens of magazines and spawned a mini-industry of Travolta spin-offs ? the press was wondering if Travolta was a " has-been . " The attacks on " Moment " came just weeks after the death of his mother , Helen . Terrified of another failure , Travolta pulled out of " American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart attack . The papers were full of stories that he 'd become a recluse , an arrogant monster . They talked about his plans for a " comeback . " Only in America does a comeback come every two years . Rebellious Edge : Travolta has been understandably cautious about his next move , but his re-emergence in " Urban Cowboy " as an industrial worker who comes of age in a rowdy Texas honky-tonk should lay to rest any doubts about his talent ? and his very particular star presence . Many observers have compared that presence ? volatile and vulnerable ? to Montgomery Cliff s ; his rebellious edge and androgynous appeal have prompted comparisons with Brando and James Dean . But it is his raw , narcissistic sexuality ? a sexuality so intimate and exposed it 's almost embarrassing to look at ? that evokes the first great male sex object of the movies , Valentino . He has also incurred the sort of wrath Valentino received . As Michael Malone writes in his book " Heroes of Eros : Male Sexuality in the Movies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and the national press ) attacked Valentino . . . just as thirty-five years later commentators would compare Elvis Presley to a hoochie-coochie dancer ' and a burlesque queen ' . . . suggests the passionate prejudice there is against the idea of the male whose essential role is sexual and romantic , the male who exists solely to seduce and be seduced by women . " Even in an era of " liberation , " the sexual role reversals of " Moment by Moment " activated the culture 's dormant puritanism : one critic said Travolta was served up as " a kind of hairy-chested Jane Russell ? a bimbo . " . Extra Savvy : But no one can deny Travolta 's status as the first ? and only ? male movie star of his generation . It is the youth audience that virtually supports and dictates the product of the movie industry , but curiously the movies ' reigning icons are all men in their 30s , 40s and 50s : Redford , Eastwood , Nicholson , @#  | Beatty , Hoffman , De Niro , Pacino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travolta stepped into a void and became the archetype of late- ' 70s youth . He is to the recession era what his idol Cagney was to the Depression : the common man ( or manchild ) with that extra savvy that sets him apart . " Saturday Night Fever 's " Tony Manero and " Urban Cowboy 's " Bud Davis , who works in a petrochemical plant by day and parties at Gilley 's free-for-all roadhouse at night , are the new working-class heroes . They 're not looking to overthrow the system , but to find the special niche ? on the dance floor , on a mechanical bucking bull ? that will give their lives some style and meaning . He 's the " Me Decade 's " knight errant ? the Me everybody knows . For all of Travolta 's versatility as an actor , his ability to lose himself inside a role , he has the true star 's emblematic presence , a quality that elevates whatever role he plays into an ongoing mythology . " The film star is not just an actor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . but a hero of legend or tragedy , embodying a destiny with which scenarists and directors must comply ? albeit unwittingly . " After the disaster of " Moment by Moment , " the Travolta legend is back on the track . Frightened ' : How does one incorporate such tumultuous early success ? " I 'm just getting around to it , that 's how slow it is , " Travolta explains , sitting under an umbrella by the pool . ( He says he 's " not used to the sun . " ) " Let 's say I went away ' emotionally while it was all happening . Moment ' was over and out before I realized Grease ' and Fever ' had happened . I had n't even enjoyed the first two ! Moment ' definitely left me anxiety-prone and frightened . I 'm more experienced now . I know how to deal with it all a little better . Even if Cowboy ' does half as well as those first films , I 'll probably get more pleasure out of the outcome because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of reality . That was overwhelm . I think now is the time for me to get rushes . " Travolta had no problem digesting the economic benefits of stardom , which have enabled him to buy his hacienda , a twobedroom house in Studio City , his fleet of cars and the Cessna 414 he pilots against the studios ' nervous objections . He 's been obsessed with planes since he was 4 , and started flying lessons at 16 . " I considered being an airline pilot , " he says , " but I was n't good in the education department and I knew you needed a college degree . " Trespassers : But fame brings isolation . Says Travolta : " Last Sunday in Studio City , I just decided I wanted to go down to the deli and spend a quiet morning reading the papers . I do n't know why I thought I could do it ... " In no time , a mob of autograph hunters developed , and he had to flee . He ca n't go shopping . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You would n't think so , but the classier ones are the worst . " ) Strangers want to pick fights . A reporter for Rolling Stone , apparently angry that Travolta would n't grant him further interview time , smashed the window of his car . There was an ugly incident when a chauffeur hit an overeager fan for trying to board Travolta 's limousine . A policeman lives in a cabin on his property , ever since a magazine article giving his address led to constant trespassers . " When I was in Houston filming , " he says , " there were about ten incidents . They found a girl in the house , hiding in the closet . Since then , I 've had to hire the protection . You definitely give up your private life , but it 's worth it . There may be days when it 's unpleasant , but at this point it 's par for the course . " The famous tend to fraternize with the famous ? or with those who were close friends before their fame . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Travolta inner circle consists of his family , especially his older sisters , Ellen , Margaret and Annie ; his high-school pal Jerry Wurms ( now an executive with John Travolta Productions ) ; his manager , Bob LeMond ; his English secretary , Joan Edwards , and her daughter , Kate ; and several of the friends he made touring in the road company of " Grease " in 1973 . But he especially cherishes the advice of those who have successfully navigated the perilous Hollywood straits . " It 's so important for me to talk to people like Jimmy Cagney . They 're giving me hope because they 've gone through the same thing . " Cagney has always been Travolta 's idol ( " I must have seen Yankee Doodle Dandy ' Galella maybe twenty times when I was 5 or 6 " ) and he glows at the recollection of the time Cagney and his wife came to Santa Barbara for a visit . " They were supposed to stay two days and they stayed four . Cagney loved it here . He said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were four of the nicest days in his life . Imagine that . I was so honored . " Travolta draws a vivid picture of the 80-year-old legend and the earnest acolyte trading stories , screening each other 's movies together , sitting up after midnight as Cagney teaches his heir how to do the gimp walk from " Love Me or Leave Me " or the walk up the wall in " Yankee . " " I asked him how he kept up with the pressure of the public , the studio , the press . I said I ca n't keep up with it . He said , Let me tell you , son , vaudeville was so cutthroat that after that the films were a piece of cake . ' They were tougher then . " Perfectionist ' : Toughness has no part in the Travolta persona , but make no mistake about the tenacity of his ambition . " John 's a worrywart , " says Kate Edwards . " If he had four aces playing poker , he 'd still @# NR 117CCi7LC T7 /TTTXTL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most sensitive person I know , male or female , " Wurms told NEWSWEEK 'S Martin Kasindorf . LeMond , who discovered Travolta at 16 playing Hugo Peabody in a supperclub production of " Bye Bye Birdie , " agrees . " He worries about every take in the movie . He worries whether the avocados are going to get ripe on his trees . It comes from being a perfectionist . But his sensitivity and vulnerability are exactly what make him a big star . " Travolta tried psychoanalysis for seven months when he was still in his teens . He had dropped out of high school at 16 to pursue acting , with the blessings of his mother , an actress and drama teacher . Work came , but Travolta , with the romantic notion that suffering is the straightest route to Art , surrounded himself with people who only made him feel worse . " I was very impressionable at that time . I was proud of my neurosis . There was a Peter Allen song , Back Doors Crying , ' that seemed to sum up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when I was sad. /Let go of good things , hung on to the bad. / In all the wrong places , /In all the wrong times . / I said I needed sadness to finish my rhymes ... " * Travolta laughs at the gloomy self-image now : " It was like whoever 's darker or more neurotic was the more talented . What the f -- - does that mean ? I decided to drop it all and I started to do well . " ' Vision ' : But even as a fastrising Broadway performer , he was not satisfied . Tom Moore , who directed Travolta in the Andrews Sisters musical " Over Het e ! " and the stage production of " Grease , " remembers his frustration and ambition . " He had a vision of where he wanted to be . I have a crazy theory . I think John created a vacuum and then stepped into it . He willed his success . " It was the hard work of acting , the passion to lose himself in a character , that kept him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loved , actress Diana Hyland , and his mother 's death of cancer . He ca n't explain his star appeal except to say : " I have a fortunate thing . I can think a thought and it comes through . I do n't know whether it 's my light eyes or presence or what , but I have to do very little . " But Travolta 's instinct for character , his observant eye and gift for mimicry are acute . In a flash , he drops into a dead-on imitation of producer Robert Stigwood 's languid Australian drawl , or a hilarious impersonation of a white New Jei sey kid who thinks he 's a black jive artist . As a child he used to give nightly performances for his parents . " They 'd sit there from nine to midnight , " he says . For " Urban Cowboy " he spent weeks learning to ride the mechanical bull , practicing the dance steps and his Texas accent , hanging out in Gilley 's and going to the urban cowboys ' homes to study their behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director James Bridges . " I ca n't sing his praises too highly . " In the editing room , where Travolta shared the right of final cut with Bridges , he insisted on cutting out many shots that emphasized his movie-star glamour . A long sequence that showed him shaving his beard is now only a fragment . According to co-producer Robert Evans , the beard Travolta wears at the beginning of the movie became an issue that almost shut down the filming . Evans and the Paramount executives wanted him to shave it ; Travolta wanted it to stay . " He did n't want anyone to know him , " claims Evans . " He was scared after Moment by Moment . ' It was a way of hiding . " What a Career ' : The film has brought Travolta out of his shell , but he is cautiously awaiting its reception before he chooses his next project . Francis Coppola and Milos Forman have expressed the desire to make a musical with Travolta ( Forman would like to pair him with Mikhail Baryshnikov ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scripts , searching for the right property . He would like to work with Bridges again and with Terrence Malick ( for whom he was going to play the Richard Gere part in " Days of Heaven " until the " Kotter " production refused to release him from his contract ) . " When I get depressed , I should just look at that list of names . If I could do a movie with each one of them ? what a career , no matter how the project turned out . " Travolta still has a few paradoxes to work out . Though he is ' happiest and healthiest when working , the insanely inflated pressures of success and failure in Hollywood will probably slow his output to a film every two years . Though he thrives on observation for the meat of his performances , his increasing isolation cuts him off from the source of his craft . He has been on a roller-coaster ride since " Fever " made him a household name , and he has survived intact . Romantically unattached at the moment , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what it is , " he says a bit defensively . " It 's constructed to lead you to your own answers . " A Scientologist sits down with Travolta on the other end of an " E Meter , " a machine that indicates in the manner of a lie detector those subjects one is fearful about . " It 's so simple . You 're going there to get rid of the bullshit and that 's it . It 's a way of pinpointing where you 're blocked . You leave a session like . . . resolved . " As Travolta explains it , there is nothing sinister or mystical about the process ? it seems simply to be the most time-efficient therapy for a young man running from commitment to commitment , a spiritual pit stop in the grueling race of success . At 26 , John Travolta has clear priorities-perhaps clearer than his sense of who he is . As one strolls through his beautiful Santa Barbara manor , every room " done " in Spanish-hacienda style , one is aware of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives there , no stamp of the owner 's personality . Over the fireplace stands a huge pen-and-ink portrait of the star . It 's a handsome sketch , but it bears no likeness to its subject . Travolta will have time to fill in the blanks later . Right now , he 's in the pilot seat of his Cessna , doing 225 knots above the Pacific ' en route to L. A. , a picture of concentration and contentment . There are no bodyguards at 7,500 feet , no autograph hunters or ringing phones . He has , he remarks , never spent more than two weeks in Santa Barbara at one stretch since he bought the hacienda in 1978 . " My favorite time , " he recalls , " I got to spend three days by myself up there . I smoked cigars and watched movies for three days ? I took two days just to watch Bertolucci 's 1900 . ' I had a ball . No one bothered me . I 'd eat by myself , take a couple of cigars and go up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oh , this is the life ! ' "
