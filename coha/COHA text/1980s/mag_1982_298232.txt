Sniffing out a suspect for the book-bomb crime <P> On a sunny afternoon last May , just two days before Mother 's Day , a parcel arrived at the two-story brick home of Howard and Joan Kipp , in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn . The package was addressed to Joan , 54 , a supervisor of guidance counselors in New York City 's public schools . Standing in her kitchen , Mrs. Kipp tore off the brown wrapping paper and found the Quick and Delicious Gourmet Cookbook . She opened the cover . Suddenly there was a flash , and two .22-cal. bullets tore into her chest . Kipp came running into the room and discovered his bleeding wife on the floor , gasping , " A bomb ! A bomb ! " Three hours later , she was dead . <P> The bomb had been rigged up ingeniously . The cookbook was only 1 in. thick , but someone had hollowed it out and placed inside a six-volt battery wired to gunpowder and three bullets . The police were mystified , as were neighbors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm ? Affable and popular , mother of two grown children , Joan Kipp was treasurer of the Bay Ridge Community Council and was expected to be named vice president the following month . Said her grieving son Craig , 27 , to a group of reporters : " It was an irresponsible , violent act that does n't make any sense at all . " <P> Worse to come ?

Since the bomb went through the mail , a federal crime , an investigation was mounted by agents of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service . Said one inspector : " It took a lot of thinking to make that bomb . " <P> By early summer they had quizzed some 200 people . Then , finally , a break : a handwriting expert matched the printing in the book 's message to that of one of the suspects . The police subpoenaed a sock belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; the dog was then set loose in a room containing the remains of the real bomb and four replicas . The animal headed straight for the genuine one , and the sock owner 's scent . Last week , 91 days after Mother 's Day , police arrested their suspect outside his Brooklyn apartment and charged him with mailing the deadly package-to his mom . The accused : Craig Kipp . The motive of Kipp , an unemployed marine engineer , was not known . Craig 's father , for one , stoutly proclaimed his son 's innocence , and raised the money to pay the $300,000 bail .
