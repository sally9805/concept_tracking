TIME Correspondent Dean Brelis is the first Western print journalist who has visited the front since the Iranian invasion of Iraq two weeks ago . He traveled to the battle area on a blistering 125 day last week , soon after the Iraqi forces had repelled the first Iranian onslaught . His report : <P> The wolflike beard and the satanic eyes glared at you from a billboard on the outskirts of Basra . Instantly recognizable , the caricature of Khomeini has a bold red X painted over the face , as if to hold back the hated enemy . Says the Arabic writing scrawled across the neck : " Khomeini , scourge of the Muslim world . " <P> We are on our way to the front in a small military convoy of Land Rovers . The mist rising from the Shatt al Arab waterway is steamy , the sky so luminous that it seems ready to burst into flame . There was shelling during the night from the Iranian artillery five miles away , but people seem unperturbed as they open their shops , till their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe-shaped dhows . <P> The countryside teems with military activity . For several miles , in the shade of palm groves , troops are setting up encampments . As tanks are unloaded , soldiers in the turrets pull goggles down over their eyes to keep out the clouds of dust . Like umbrellas opening , tents acquire taut shapes ; in their midst , a white flag with a red crescent , the symbol of a hospital , is raised . Binoculars to his eyes , a brigadier looks out toward the horizon , where he hears bursts of artillery . His or theirs ? " Ours , " he replies , pointing in the direction of the enemy lines . " They are getting ready to attack again . You can smell battle in the air . " <P> From this point on , there are no paved roads , only desert track . The terrain increasingly becomes more barren , and I begin to appreciate the meaning of the old saying " hot as hell . " The first battle has left its marks on the desert . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there are still bodies all around , partially covered now by the drifting sand . Most of the dead are Iranian soldiers , caught in a trap from which they could not escape . The Iraqis pretended to retreat , drawing the Iranian forces into what an Iraqi colonel describes as a " killing zone . " He explains : " God was on our side . Just then , a fierce sandstorm arose and blinded the enemy . His tanks crashed into one another . We were already in position , our backs to the wind . It was a massacre . " <P> The Iraqi trap was sprung near a man-made body of water called Fish Lake . For a short time , the Iranians held the pumping station that feeds river water into the lake , but they were soon beaten back by an Iraqi counterattack . Once again in Iraqi hands , the pumps are pouring thousands of gallons into Fish Lake , thereby increasing the size of the water barrier against an enemy armored thrust .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
