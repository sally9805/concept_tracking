txt Two contenders in the battle for semiconductor market share are preparing to announce a novel and farreaching accord for pooling their research and development resources . The 10-year cross-licensing and technology exchange agreement is between Intel Corp . and Advanced Micro Devices Inc . The pact is built around Intel 's 8086 family of microprocessors , or computers-on-a-chip , and Advanced Micro 's peripheral devices . But the Intel-Advanced Micro alliance could go even further , contemplating future joint development of chips made with diverse technologies . Future areas of cooperation may include software support designed by Intel and telecommunications products by Advanced Micro . Advanced Micro also will have an opportunity to obtain a license to manufacture and market the newest entry to Intel 's arsenal , the iAPX 432 " micromainframe , " which is a mainframe computer built around three superpowerful chips . This would occur when Intel 's sales of the device reach a certain level . Advanced Micro 's chairman , W.J. Jerry Sanders , hailed the pact as " a new wave of innovative techniques for improving R &D; efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SI million and S2 million from S100,000 in the past decade . The 16-bit microprocessor that is at the heart of this agreement is expected to sell 1.1 million units in 1981 and 10 million units in 1985 . Intel commonly refers to its 8086 , introduced in 1978 , as " the preferred microprocessor . " But strategic product planning for the future also in envisioned . " What we 're saying , " as Advanced Micro spokesman said , " is that our R &D; guys will sit down at a table with their R &D; guys , and decide what new products need to be made and who will make them . " There are other reasons for the pact . By authorizing Advanced Micro as a licensed " second source , " Intel ensures that the versions of its 8086 being marketed are produced exactly according to its specifications . This suggests a defense against the common practice of " reverse engineering " by unlicensed competitors . Reverse engineering is the process by which a company copies a circuit design by enlarging a finished original . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce the 8086 without the benefit of a license . Because the pact initially involves about a dozen of Intel 's proprietary products and about three of Advanced Micro 's products , some observers have questioned the pact 's balance . " We do seem to be getting the better deal , " said an Advanced Micro insider . Explained Mr. Sanders : " Intel is priming the pump , and getting us off to a running start in order for us to help expand the market . " Intel , ranked as the third-largest maker of integrated circuits , had 5854.6 million in revenue for 1980 . Advanced Micro , ranked eighth , had 5309.4 million in sales in the year ended March 29 . Intel previously has licensed other companies to produce its 8086 , including Siemens AG , Matra-Harris Semiconductors of France and Fujitsu Ltd . However , no prior agreement was as far-reaching as Intel 's pact with Advanced Micro . For Advanced Micro , the alliance means phasing out a cross-licensing agreement with the Zilog Inc. unit of Exxon Corp. , an agreement that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
