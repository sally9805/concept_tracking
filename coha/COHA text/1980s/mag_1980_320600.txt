' Reagan will fall like a crowbar ... awfully fast " <P> A year ago , he was somewhat bored with his job . He occasionally napped in his office and sometimes slipped home early-to the point that the Georgians around Jimmy Carter complained that Vice President Walter Mondale was not working hard enough . But then came the crisis in Iran , and the President had to depend on his Vice President for much of the hard slogging of the primary campaigning . Now back in the good graces of Carter 's inner circle , Mondale is looking forward eagerly to a strenuous regimen of four-day-a-week campaign swings , making slashing attacks on Ronald Reagan and defending the Carter record . Mondale seems not the least bit uncomfortable in this role , even though it has required him to trim many of his longstanding liberal views , which at one time placed him close to Edward Kennedy on many issues . Mondale 's stomach is flat-thanks to tennis-and his face deeply tanned - thanks to a few days of fishing for striped bass off New Jersey . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 52-year-old Vice President offered some observations on the campaign . Excerpts : <P> <P> Q. Will Senator Kennedy 's harsh language during the primaries hurt you in the election ? <P> <P> A. I think that the public takes that with a lot of salt . They know that we politicians get tired , make mistakes , get angry , just as they do in their own lives . I remember Hubert Humphrey once said that Kennedy had all the substance of a paper doily , and then a week later , Hubert said that Kennedy 's stand on an issue was the greatest thing in the history of mankind . You know , doilies are important . <P> <P> Q. It is widely believed that the old Democratic coalition is breaking up . Do you agree ? <P> <P> A. When the campaign gets going , I think you 'll see a very strong firming up of the traditional constituencies of this party : minorities , farmers , teachers , union members , blue-collar workers . I must be candid and say that we 've got a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a dramatic closing of the gap with Reagan in the next month . For one thing , I think we already see John Anderson fading . That will strengthen us because we 'll then have only one opponent . The other thing is that I believe when Reagan starts to fall , he 'll fall like a crowbar . <P> <P> Q. Why will he fall ? <P> <P> A. First of all , his record on everything , domestic and foreign , is an abomination , and we intend to remind voters of it : when he called the League of Women Voters the " Rhine Maidens , " when he said he wanted to tear up SALT II . Second , Reagan does n't know anything about the Federal Government . He particularly does n't know anything about international affairs , security matters and economics . I think the contrast with Carter is problems . <P> <P> Q. If Reagan has all these shortcomings - baggage , if you will-how has he got so far ? <P> <P> A. Because the Republican crowd likes that baggage . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Equal Rights Amendment in Minnesota ! They 're off to the right . I do n't think they represent the country . <P>
