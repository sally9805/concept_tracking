Finally Britain has an issue that cuts across social , economic and political lines : something very odd is going on in the farmlands of southern England . Strange circular depressions , up to 100 ft. in diameter , have appeared in crop fields throughout the area , leaving no clues about how they got there . These puzzling circles  --  large sweeping areas neatly flattened in a swirling pattern  --  do not exhibit the kind of rough damage caused by harsh weather , animals or humans . Researchers studying the phenomenon have convincingly ruled out man-made hoaxes , yet they differ on how to explain the occurrences . The * search for answers has even sparked interest in Parliament , where two M.P.s have called for the government to investigate . <P> The first recorded sighting of the circles took place in 1976 , when a farmworker at Headbourne Worthy in Hampshire noticed a large circular pattern in a field near the A34 highway . Since 1980 , when serious research into the mystery began , more than 600 occurrences have been reported in Britain , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circles from as far away as the Soviet Union , Japan and New Zealand , by far the greatest number have appeared in Hampshire and Wiltshire . To some , it is no coincidence that this area of southern England is also home to the similarly mysterious stone formations at Stonehenge and Avebury . <P> Whatever the cause , the circles are particularly intriguing because they are beautiful geometric formations that level crops in a precise pattern . The plant , usually a grain , although mustard , soybeans and sugar beets have also been affected , is flattened in a distinctive swirl ; nonetheless , it continues to ripen until ready for harvest . The formations range from single rings to more complex quintuplets and even a " Celtic cross " of four circles linked by one large ring . This year two new patterns were spotted : a ringed circle with swirls in opposite directions , and the " tadpole , " a single circle with a long curling tail . <P> The recent upsurge in circle sightings coincides with the publication of two new books on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Its Mysteries by Dr. Terence Meaden , a physicist who has been tracking the puzzling formations since 1980 . Meaden speculates that the disturbances may come from what he calls the " plasma vortex phenomenon , " a previously unknown form of atmospheric disturbance with associated electrical effects . He contends that a " spinning ball of air " that is highly charged with electricity hits the crop field and marks out the circle . But how could something as wild as a vicious wind produce such carefully sculpted creations ? <P> The other book , Circular Evidence by Pat Delgado and Colin Andrews , is handsomely illustrated but largely anecdotal . It attempts to link the circles to such paranormal events as luminous apparitions and UFOs . Some observers support such supernatural notions , claiming that one of the groupings might be formed by landing pods from a spaceship .
