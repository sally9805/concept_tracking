txt Alfa Romeo , Italy 's state-run auto company , begins negotiations today with union leaders over planned layoffs and production cuts for 1982 . The Alfa Romeo plan calls for a 35% cut in output and layoffs for 14,000 of the company 's 43,000 employes . About 5.000 to 6,000 Alfa workers would be sent home for the entire year , with the remainder taking shorter terms of leave . Vehicle production is to drop to about 170,000 units from 270,000 , to clear inventories and compensate for a predicted 5% fall in Italian auto sales for the coming year . The Italian metalworkers union . FLM , has already expressed its opposition to the massive layoff plan . " We are particularly opposed to the high number of layoffs planned for a year-long basis , " says FLM official Silvano Veronese . Factory union councils have called on the government to come up with an alternative plan more to their liking . Burdened by Debt Alfa Romeo , Italy 's second-largest car producer behind Fiat S.p.A. , is struggling under total debts estimated at $576 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company narrowed its deficit 20% in 1980 from 1979 , the loss still came to around $88 million on revenue of about $2.2 billion . Earlier this year , Corrado Innocenti , Alfa Romeo vice president , predicted the company would be in the black within three to five years . That hope may founder on predictions of a sagging Italian auto market and severe production problems . Production efficiency is the company 's major problem . Estimates show that Alfa produces 7.6 cars per employe contrasted with Fiat 's per-worker production of 13.9 . At the company 's Alfasud plant outside Naples , that figure drops to 3.8 . Alfa Romeo is reported to be losing between $1,300 and $1,700 daily on each car produced at the Naples plant , where output was 33,000 units below target for the first nine months of this year . On the day of a crucial Italian soccer match last year . nearly 40% of the workers on one Alfasud work turn contracted a strange illness which lasted only seven hours . Most had slips from their doctors . Production Goals Set Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's two main factories , in Naples and in Arese near Milan . were each to have reached output levels of 573 units a day by Sept. 1 . But production at the Arese plant , which had been showing major improvements , was 100 units below that level . By October . production was to have risen to 680 units a day in Naples and 620 units a day in Arese , but the plan has been delayed . A major problem was that factory union councils did n't agree to the plan to replace a 10 minute-an-hour assembly break with staggered , shorter intervals . Employes staged protest slowdowns and began taking their 10 minute-an-hour breaks as they had done before . However , Mr. Veronese of the metalworkers union says the union is currently prepared to fully support the new production format if a less painful solution to the problem of layoffs can be found .
