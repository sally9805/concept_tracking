Written words running loose have always presented a challenge to people bent on ruling others . In times past , religious zealots burned heretical ideas and heretics with impartiality . Modern tyrannies promote the contentment and obedience of their subjects by ruthlessly keeping troubling ideas out of their books and minds . Censorship can place people in bondage more efficiently than chains . <P> Thanks to the First Amendment , the U.S. has been remarkably , if not entirely , free of such official monitoring . Still , the nation has always had more than it needs of voluntary censors , vigilantes eager to protect everybody from hazards like ugly words , sedition , blasphemy , unwelcome ideas and , perhaps worst of all , reality . Lately , however , it has been easy to assume that when the everything-goes New Permissiveness gusted forth in the 1960s , it blew the old book-banning spirit out of action for good . <P> Quite the contrary . In fact , censorship has been on the rise in the U.S. for the past ten years . Every region of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the censorial spirit .

National attention has focused on a few notorious censorship cases , such as the book-banning crusade that exploded into life-threatening violence in Kanawha County . W. Va. , in 1974 . But most kindred episodes that have been cropping up all over have remained localized and obscure . <P> The Idaho Falls , Idaho , school book review committee did not make a big splash when it voted , 21 to 1 , to ban One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest-in response to one parent 's objection to some of the language . It was not much bigger news when Anaheim , Calif. , school officials authorized a list of approved books that effectively banned many previously studied books , including Richard Wright 's classic Black Boy .
