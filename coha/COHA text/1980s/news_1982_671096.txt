" The major political result of the E.R.A. fight has been the politicization of women , " said Kathy Wilson , director of the National Women ' s Political Caucus . " We can no longer be standing on the outside wringing our hands over every roll-call vote . We have got to get women in office. " // Similar views have been widely expressed by other leaders of the movement since it became apparent a few days ago that the proposed amendment would fail to be ratified by the required three-fourths of the state legislatures before the June 30 deadline . The National Organization for Women , the chief supporter of the measure , announced Thursday that it had given up the fight. // There was disagreement in the movement and among political analysts , however , about how effective the drive to elect women might be and about the overall future direction of the movement . NOW , for example , says that in addition to trying to elect more women to office , it will work to defeat legislators who have opposed its stands. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored by a majority of Americans in public opinion polls for the last 10 years could come so close to victory , being approved by 35 of the 38 states needed , yet fail despite a well-financed and active lobbying campaign. // Feminist leaders , some of whom were embittered by the defeat , said the demise of the proposed amendment was likely to bring more unity to a movement divided on tactics for achieving legal equality . Some groups had contended that the National Organization for Women , the largest and best-financed of the organizations working for ratification , poured too much of its resources into the struggle for the rights amendment at the expense of other women ' s causes. // In future , according to Eleanor Smeal , the organization ' s president , those resources will be used largely to back women who are candidates for offices at the Federal and state levels to create a more favorable political climate for women ' s interests . The organization also plans to file new lawsuits against corporations accused of sexual bias. // The National Organization for Women had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the proposed amendment . It has 180 , 000 members , 300 full-time paid workers , 6 , 700 full-time volunteers and 750 telephone banks for spreading its message. // Yet there is dispute about the assertion that this force , and that of other organizations that fought for the measure , can be transferred intact into election campaigns on behalf of a range of candidates scattered around the nation . <> <> Women ' s Party Discussed // Richard M. Scammon , a nonpartisan election analyst , said it was one thing to raise a large amount of money and armies of volunteers for one particular cause such as the rights amendment and another to do the same for the more general support of candidates for various offices. // And there is division in the movement on political affiliation . Mrs. Smeal , dissatisfied with both major political parties , recently tried to organize support to form a third party to represent women . Some supporters of the rights amendment told her that to do so could destroy the movement. // " I told her she could count me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said State Representative Cleta Detherage of Oklahoma , who led the fight for the rights proposal in her state. // Mrs. Smeal said Thursday that there were no plans for a third party at this time , and that her organization would back candidates , including men if they have a proven pro-woman record , in the two major parties in this year ' s elections . <> <> Corporate Involvement Questioned // Both parties recognize the movement as a potent force in most elections at all levels . Rich Bond , deputy director of the National Republican Committee , dismissed the National Organization for Women ' s charges of Republican indifference to women ' s rights as " verbal styrofoam from Eleanor Smeal . " He said the party was gearing up for a major campaign for women ' s rights in the elections this year. // Kathy Wilson of the Women ' s Political Caucus , which was formed to elect more women to public office , said most of the group ' s candidates in the coming elections would be women who had learned politics while working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the measure believe it was defeated because of the intervention of corporate interests , which profit , they said , by paying lower wages to women , charging higher insurance rates and other discriminatory tactics . Mrs. Smeal , speaking at a news conference Thursday , said the corporate influence was behind the male legislators who cast the decisive votes against the proposed amendment in Florida , North Carolina , Illinois and other states . <> <> Conservative Organization Cited // Mrs. Smeal said the corporate interests that profit by discrimination contributed heavily to the campaigns of opponents to the amendment . And she said the preponderance of men in the state legislatures created a " stag club atmosphere " that made them insensitive to women ' s concerns. // But in Oklahoma City , Mrs. Detherage , while agreeing that discrimination is profitable to many companies , had a different view of why the proposed amendment failed. // " After the amendment was approved by Congress and a lot of states ratified it right away , the leaders of the national movement knew nothing of the ratification processs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , especially the " new right , " moved in and made it the central symbol of threats to family , religion and other traditional values , she added . Phyllis Schlafly , especially , a longtime political activist whose group , Stop ERA , led the opposition to the proposal , " seized on the amendment and made it a political tool " for a variety of right-wing causes , Mrs. Detherage said . <> <> Legislatures Reduced Support // " There is nothing radical about the E.R.A. , " she said , " but they made it appear that way . " The one-sentence amendment read : " Equality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied by the United States or any state on account of sex. " // Mrs. Detherage suggested that legislatures reduced support for the measure by changing state laws to make them more favorable to women ' s concerns. // " It wasn ' t until the last year , " she said , " that proponents organized the kind of campaign that was needed , and by then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyst , said it was not unusual for an amendment to be rejected by the states when a majority of the public favored it . They can be " overtaken by events , " he said , as was the case when the proposed amendment banning child labor early in the century was largely forgotten after states enacted laws against the practice. // The complicated system of ratification also made it easier to block approval , as seen on the issues of school prayer and a balanced Federal budget , Mr. Scammon said . Both issues have been around for years with majority approval in the public opinion polls , but neither is close to becoming part of the Constitution . <> <> Suffrage and Prohibition // More than majority approval is necessary , Mr. Scammon said . " Women were successful in obtaining ratification of two amendments early in this century , women ' s suffrage and prohibition of alcoholic beverages , and they did it when they could not vote , as they do now , " he said , suggesting that women were more committed to those amendments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defeat for the proposed rights amendment engendered so much bitterness , several leaders said , was that activists in its behalf felt that they had been deeply wronged , frequently by male legislators who promised to vote for it but changed their minds at the last minute. // Many of the women involved in the fight , Mrs. Detharege pointed out , " are not political . " " They think because we are right we should prevail , " she said . " But I know that in politics that is almost never the standard . In politics you just have to take your losses and know there will be another day. " //
