Ever since the genetic code was cracked in the 1960s , biologists have believed the language of DNA to be rather like the Latin of the medieval church : universal , fundamental and indispensable . It seemed that all creatures , from men to mice to humble E. coli bacteria , shared the same basic instructions for making proteins , the building blocks of life ; variations among organisms were thought to involve only the number and type of proteins that are strung together . Now researchers in the U.S. , Europe and Japan have found species + that defy certain words in the genetic scripture : in the familiar Paramecium , a single-celled protozoan , and in a bacterium called Mycoplasma capricolum , the DNA patterns responsible for protein construction exhibit a surprising difference . Not only does the discovery undermine the " universality " of the genetic code , but it may cause scientists to rethink certain theories about evolution . <P> The double-helix DNA molecule , which is encased in the center of every living cell , is shaped like a spiral staircase . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four different nucleotides , rep- resented by the letters A , T , G and C. Grouped into sets of three steps , the nucleotides are called codons , which dictate , or code for , the 20 amino acids , the subunits of protein . A few codons , or code words , serve as punctuation marks , telling the cellular machinery to start or stop adding amino acids to the growing protein chain . <P> It was while studying the membrane of Paramecium that Biologist John Preer Jr . and his colleagues at Indiana University in Bloomington stumbled onto the aberrant code . In the midst of the long sequences of Paramecium codons , they kept finding words that in most creatures read " stop . " Yet in Paramecium , the word added another amino acid . Says Preer : " We thought it must be an error in our technique . " However , news soon filtered over from the Centre de Genetique Moleculaire laboratory near Paris that scientists there were encountering the same anomaly . As the two groups report in a recent issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever the Paramecium 's cellular machinery read either of two " periods " ( TAG and TAA ) in the standard code , it linked the amino acid glutamine onto the protein chain rather than stopping production ; it obeyed only the third word for stop , TGA . At Nagoya University in Japan , scientists have found that Mycoplasma also ignores a stop triplet . But in this case it is TGA that is translated into an amino acid , tryptophan , while the other two codons are read as stop . " Within a certain sphere , " says Biologist Syozo Osawa , " it seems that change is possible . " <P> The latest revelations challenge certain assumptions of the so-called code- frozen accident theory postulated by Francis Crick , who with James Watson discovered the structure of DNA . Crick proposed that the genetic code was essentially an accident of nature , which , once fixed a few billion years ago , would never change . Explains Preer : " It 's hard to imagine how one code could evolve into another without jeopardizing the protein in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have occurred very early on ; some biologists suggest that the alterations may have been a ploy by one-celled creatures to resist viruses , which destroy cells by invading them and taking over their cellular machinery .
