Whatever the time of year , a sore throat is the single most common reason for a visit to the doctor . Yet that is no assurance that your sore throat will be properly treated . Recent studies indicate that the true cause of a sore throat is often overlooked or improperly identified , even if the doctor takes a throat culture . As a result , treatment may be misdirected , unnecessarily exposing patients to antibiotics that can not possibly cure them . In other cases , a new study in Boston has shown , patients may be incorrectly told that their sore throats are caused by viruses and that antibiotics would not be useful. // A sore throat is a symptom , not a disease . By itself , it is no more revealing than pain , itch , cough or fever . To choose the proper remedy , you and the doctor must first zero in on the probable cause. // PERSONAL HEALTH Sore throats can result from such irritations as excessive talking , singing or shouting ( for example , trying to make yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music ) , cigarette smoking , exposure to toxic fumes or sleeping in a room with extremely dry air . Most of these sore throats are preventable ; if dry air is a problem , for example , try using a humidifier in your bedroom at night . Sore throats are often caused by allergies or infections by viruses or bacteria , for example , colds , influenza , streptococcal infection , infectious mononucleosis , sinusitis , gonorrhea or other venereal infections . Rarely , they are caused by tumors of the throat. // Although most sore throats will clear up within a few days with no treatment , some require medical attention . Occasionally , sore throats are medical emergencies that demand immediate attention to prevent fatal blockage of the breathing passages . Thus it is important to know when to seek medical assistance for a sore throat and what to expect from the practitioner to be sure your symptom is properly handled. // Determining the cause and treatment . Diagnosing the reason for a sore throat is a combination of medical art and science . If the sore throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of a day , and is accompanied by other signs of illness such as runny nose , fever or chills , cough or hoarseness , the cause is likely to be a virus , commonly a cold or flu . Only time and symptomatic treatments will relieve the soreness caused by these viral infections. // On the other hand , if the sore throat starts abruptly and is accompanied by severe pain , high fever , swollen glands in the neck , headache , stiff neck and perhaps stomach pains and vomiting , the cause could be streptococcus . This is a bacterium that , if not properly treated with antibiotics , can go underground and years later cause rheumatic heart disease and other complications. // A throat culture , in which the doctor swabs the diseased part of the throat and attempts to grow the collected organisms in a laboratory dish overnight , usually reveals if " strep " is the cause . However , throat cultures are not always accurate , and the doctor ' s judgment must also play a role in deciding whether a strep infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the appearance of the throat ( which is why prescribing antibiotics over the telephone is usually a bad idea ) , the patient ' s other symptoms and the presence of strep infections in the neighborhood or the family . Strep infections most commonly occur between the ages of 5 and 25 , and many experts say that all sore throats among people in that age range should be cultured. // Strep infections are usually treated with penicillin ( or erythromycin , in the case of known penicillin allergy ) . However , unless there is good evidence for a strep infection , doctors who practice careful medicine are reluctant to prescribe penicillin because of the risk of an allergic reaction or the development of penicillin- resistant infections . Many doctors will start a patient on penicillin while waiting for the results of the throat culture , and then stop the antibiotic if the culture results are negative . However , other experts say that this is rarely necessary since the antibiotic makes hardly a day ' s difference in the rate of recovery from a strep infection. // If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremely important to take it for the full length of time , even though you may feel better in a day or two . It can take 10 days of treatment to knock out bacterial infections and prevent them from causing delayed damage to vital organs. // When a child suffers from repeated attacks of tonsillitis ( severe infections of the tonsils ) , the question of tonsillectomy is often raised . A continuing study at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine has indicated that tonsillectomy is justified if six medically documented episodes of tonsillitis occur in one year , or five per year occur for two consecutive years , or three per year occur for three or more years. // Doctors commonly assume that when a throat culture is negative and other signs of strep are lacking , a viral infection is the cause of sore throats . However , a new study conducted among 763 adults with sore throats by researchers from Brigham and Women ' s Hospital in Boston and the University of San Francisco Medical School revealed that more than 30 percent were suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The organisms were Chlamydia trachomatis , now the leading cause of sexually transmitted infections in this country , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae , a known cause of pneumonia. // Both these organisms require treatment with antibiotics that are different from those appropriate for strep throat . Whereas penicillin ( or , in the case of penicillin allergy , erythromycin ) is the drug of choice for strep throat , chlamydial and mycoplasmal infections are best treated with tetracycline or erythromycin . Chlamydial infections can also be treated with sulfa drugs . Chlamydia can spread from person to person through hand- to-hand contact with a person with a venereal infection who has touched the genital area as well as by sexual contact. // When to call the doctor . It ' s not necessary to call the doctor for every sore throat . If the soreness is mild , lasts for a day or two and is accompanied by the symptoms of a viral infection , experts recommend waiting it out . However , according to consultants to Patient Care magazine , a doctor should be called if the sore throat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The pain is so severe that it interferes with swallowing. // // * You notice pus on the back of the throat or tonsils. // * You have a fever or skin rash. // // * A child with sore throat has fever , headache , vomiting , stomach pain or swollen glands. // // * The sore throat has lasted for more than two days. // // * You have been exposed to someone with a strep throat. // // * You have had rheumatic fever or kidney disease. // If the doctor asks to see the patient , it is wise to follow that advice. // How to relieve throat soreness . Regardless of the cause of your sore throat , you can diminish your discomfort by doing the following : // // * Gargle every few hours with salt water ( half a teaspoon of salt in one cup of warm water ) . A teaspoon of molasses or corn syrup can substitute for the salt for those who might accidentally swallow the gargle mixture. // // * Take aspirin or acetaminophen. // // * Drink plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hard candy or lozenges ( but don ' t use medicated lozenges for more than a few days ) . // // * Use a vaporizer or humidifier. // // * Get plenty of rest. //
