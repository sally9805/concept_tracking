He is a lawyer , essayist and . . . oh , yes-a terrific musician <P> Quick . Catch him now , before he gets elected . <P> He is 35 , one of the biggest stars in Latin American music , a composer who can combine bold lyrics , intricate narratives and bright , salsa-inflected melodies with the fine flair of the best singer-songwriters . Bruce Springsteen , Pete Townshend , Jackson Browne come first to mind , and if that is heavy , heady company , then all right , just keep the jostling to a minimum and make a little room . <P> But even way up there at the top where the air is thin , Rubn Blades would seem a rare , highflying creature . His songs have not only rhythms that insinuate but lyrics that can touch the conscience with humane political passion . He has been a lawyer for a bank in Panama , a mail boy working for a Latin record company in New York City and one of the main perpetrators , with Trombonist Willie Colon , of Siembra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He currently writes short essays on art and politics for the newspaper La Estrella de Panam ; conducts a long-distance collaboration with Gabriel Garcia Mrquez on a cycle of songs based on some of the Nobel prizewinner 's early stories ; and , with his pistol-hot band , Sets del Solar ( Six from the Tenement ) , has been galvanizing a concert tour that has ricocheted from Berkeley , Calif. , to the Cannes Film Festival and home to New York City . He can also be heard on the sound track of Beat Street , the just opened break-dancing movie , doing nicely by a lollipop love theme . But the best place to catch Blades and his Tenement Six is on their new Elektra/Asylum album , Buscando America ( Searching for America ) . All the record 's seven cuts are sung in Spanish , but if there is a better album this year in any language , its impact will have to be measured off the charts . On the Richter scale , maybe . <P> It seems a shame , then , that Blades is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change his mind , which is good news for anyone who favors music with a hard edge and a hard swing . This fall Blades will move farther north , from his bachelor apartment on Manhattan 's Upper West Side to the cultivated wilds of Cambridge , Mass. , where he will work for a master 's degree in law at Harvard . " I am totally convinced that I am going to have a lot to do with the future of my country , " he says . " But I do n't want people to say , ' What does this guy know ? He 's been singing . ' " Getting a master 's is probably a prudent first step on a very extravagant course , but anyone who has listened to Blades sing his songs in his streetwise tenor would have no doubt that he knows plenty already . <P> As he says of Garcia Mrquez , Blades has " one foot on the moon and the other on the earth . We are both citizens of an emotional continent . " Blades ' songs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pregnant teenagers , explore exotic territory that is made immediate and familiar by his graceful narrative gifts and by the fleet , conversational translations of the lyrics that he provides on the album 's inner cover ( " Where do people who disappear go to ? Look in the water and in the high grass . . . When do they return ? Every time our thoughts bring them back " ) .
