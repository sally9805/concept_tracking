Since both are reasonable men , not madmen in the Khomeini and Gaddafi image , no bombs have been dropped . After a century of Pax Britannica and a short period of Pax Americana , the world has entered the phase of Pax Atomica . The only danger is the so-called peace movement in the West , which imperils the balance of power . This can lead to nuclear war or to nuclear blackmail and surrender of the West .
