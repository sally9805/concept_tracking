Day after day on the front pages , night after night on television screens , Argentina is reliving  --  and hoping to redeem  --  a bloodstained past . Confronting the country are full and grisly accounts of the " dirty war , " the years between 1976 and 1981 , in which at least 10,000 Argentines either were killed or disappeared as a succession of military governments fought against what they considered to be leftist subversion . Those were years of unbridled terror , of torture , abduction , rape and execution , of victims being dropped from helicopters , of the dreaded night-time knock on the door . One citizen last week recalled how he had won a colonel 's admiration by surviving a five- hour torture session ; another remembered seeing a presidential press secretary stretched out on a billiard table with electric wires attached to his mouth and toes . Former President Alejandro Lanusse told of how he had once reproached a police officer for failing to report the discovery of a body . " Do n't forget , General , " the man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the river . " <P> For the past month , such testimony has sent a chill through the Tribunales courtroom in Buenos Aires . There , six judges are presiding over a trial in which nine top military leaders , including three former Presidents , are charged with responsibility for a broad sweep of crimes . " There has never been anything like this in Latin America , " says Journalist Jacobo Timerman , who himself was imprisoned and tortured . " Imagine  --  civilians sitting in judgment on the military . " <P> At the same time , however , President Raul Alfonsin 's determination to come to grips with the past has confronted him with a major dilemma : he must honor his commitment to democracy and a citizenry 's clamoring for justice by punishing the guilty among the soldiers , yet he can not afford either to destroy or to alienate the 60,000-strong career military . <P> Three days after he took office in December 1983 , Alfonsin told Argentines that the members of the juntas that ruled during the dirty war would be charged with murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the Supreme Military Council announced that it found nothing " objectionable " in the juntas ' directives . As a result , the cases were moved to the civilian federal appeals court , where Prosecutor Julio Cesar Strassera is detailing 709 representative incidents of transgressions by security forces . Some time before midterm congressional elections in November , the judiciary is expected to hand down stiff sentences against the generals who issued the orders and some of their subordinates , who went beyond the call of duty in following them . <P> What is not clear is what will happen to 1,200 junior officers accused in specific instances . Alfonsin hopes that civilian courts will deal with them , but Argentine human rights organizations are agitating for a thorough cleansing of the entire military . Says Hebe de Bonafini , president of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , who for eight years have staged protests against the disappearance of their relatives : " When my son was taken , five cars came to the house . He was tortured for hours . They are all responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . "
