by Neil Simon <P> How many people ankle up to a bar and ask for a lemonade ? Fools is a lemonade play . It has a homey flavor , and it is not altogether unrefreshing , but it lacks the comic belt to command Broadway 's current tab of $25 a shot . <P> Neil Simon has set his latest play in a kind of Anatevka-cum-Brigadoon locale . The town is called Kulyenchikov , and its inhabitants are Russian villagers . In Brigadoon , time stood still except for a day ; in Kulyenchikov , minds stand still every minute . The natives are under a " long ago " curse damning them to stupidity . <P> <P> The town butcher ( Joseph Leon ) sweeps dirt off his porch into his house . Told to lower her voice , the wife ( Mary Louise Wilson ) of an eye doctor ( Harold Gould ) scrunches toward the floor . Occasionally , Simon abandons these hoary vaudeville turns for a flash of absurdist humor . The doctor 's daughter ( Pamela Reed ) , adorable as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replies , " Yellow . . . because it does n't stick to your fingers so much . " Her mother mutters : " I think she 's wrong . I think it 's blue . " <P> A young schoolteacher ( John Rubinstein ) comes to Kulyenchikov . Smitten by Reed , he is swept into a kind of " Romeo and Wooliet " romance and lifts the village curse through true love . Rubinstein is an ardent and vastly sympathetic performer , but neither he nor the deft comic ministrations of Director Mike Nichols can salvage this show . For whatever it may mean , Simon 's two weakest efforts in 19 plays have a Russian connection , The Good Doctor , a kind of Chekhovian doodle , and now Fools . When next tempted in that direction , he should probably say nyet. - By T.E . Kalem
