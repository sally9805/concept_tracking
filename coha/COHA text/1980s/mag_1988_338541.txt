There used to be nothing treacherous about reading a magazine . There was nothing to come off on your clothes ( except maybe too much ink ) , nothing to make your eyes water or take away your taste for dinner . But now , as perfume makers seek greater access to their customers , the magazine has become something of a minefield  --  and a smelly minefield at that . More and more perfume manufacturers are relying on not just provocative texts and evocative images but a sample of the real thing . Turn the page , break open the " scent strip " and get a full blast of Giorgio of Beverly Hills ; or Calvin Klein 's Obsession ; Fendi , the passion of Rome ; or Faberge 's McGregor . " The fragrance business is so highly competitive , " says Melisande Congdon-Doyle , director of cosmetic and fragrance marketing at Harper 's Bazaar , " that the only way to get the scent before the noses of people is to go to them directly . " For a person who receives several such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be overpowering . " What is that smell , Janet ? " <P> The strips are usually postcard size and placed in such tony magazines as Vogue , Town &; Country and Vanity Fair . The ad is coated with millions of tiny drops of fragrant oils , sealed inside specially designed capsules . The capsules are mixed with a binding agent and affixed to the paper to prevent the scents from bursting during rough handling in the mail . Once the ad is ripped open , the scent behaves just as if it were wafting in the air above the perfume counter . <P> Giorgio was the pioneer of scent strips , but more than a dozen other manufacturers have followed suit , since the tactic seems to work wonders . Fragrance sales , which fell in the early 1980s , have steadily risen for the past five years , according to the Fragrance Foundation . Scent strips have become so effective that they are challenging department stores as the primary means for introducing and sampling new fragrances . For readers who can not make it to the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number to call to buy the product from the privacy of their living room . <P> Perfume is just the beginning . Rolls-Royce has run an ad in Architectural Digest that lets readers smell the leathery Rolls interiors . Calls to the company increased fourfold the month after the ad appeared . Readers could also breathe deeply of DeKuyper 's Original Peachtree Schnapps or scratch and catch a whiff of Ralston Purina 's dog food Butcher 's Blend . McCormick &; Co . Inc. of Hunt Valley , Md. , has put out its annual report on sales of its spices . The financial statements smelled of buttered cinnamon . <P> There are a few deterrents to further proliferation . The ads cost a lot , as much as $35,000 more than a regular one-page color ad in a magazine like Mademoiselle . Some readers still complain about the most aggressive inserts , and other , unscented advertisers may be afraid that readers will discard the magazine to escape from a smelly page . Gripes Nancy Conarroe , a Manhattan food consultant : " I am allergic to perfume , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are offensive and unwanted . "
