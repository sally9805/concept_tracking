LAST OF THE BREED <P> by Louis L'Amour <P> Bantam ; 358 pages ; $17.95 <P> Even John Wayne made a picture in modern dress every once in a while . Louis L'Amour , western man , has followed the Duke 's example . In his 95th novel , Last of the Breed , he focuses on Joseph Makatozi , a major in the U.S. Air Force . But Joe is not quite the contemporary he seems . Sioux and Cheyenne blood flows in his arteries ( " My people were warriors once " ) , and when his experimental aircraft is forced down over the Bering Sea , he becomes a Native American fugitive in a 20th century world , retracing the path his ancestors took across the strait to fresh hunting grounds . In pursuit are the current equivalent of bounty hunters : Soviet agents under the baton of the crafty Colonel Zamatev . The influence of Film Director John Ford soon seems to overshadow the action : " ( Joe 's ) hair had grown long , and rather than try to cut it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hung down over his chest . All you need now , he told himself , is a necklace of bear claws . " But this is more than a scenario , and L'Amour has not simply traded Remingtons for rockets : his - knowledge of the frozen North is well researched , his KGB men have enough dimension to throw a long shadow , and along the trek he even mentions straight shooters like Ivan Karamazov and Balzac 's Pere Goriot . Those were mighty rare figures on the old prairie ; the garrulous storyteller is not only moving on , he is trading up . <P> THE INHUMAN CONDITION <P> by Clive Barker <P> Poseidon ; 220 pages ; $12.95 <P> Ever since the heyday of horror fiction , when Henry James and Edith Wharton tried their hands at the supernatural , aficionados have been awaiting a writer to transcend the genre and give it a new legitimacy . Clive Barker may be the man . He is as morbid as Stephen King , but unlike his American counterpart , this 33-year-old writer from Liverpool is witty , unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns the world into a monkey house ; a vagrant with a mass of knotted material seems to be playing with nothing less than DNA ; a palace is built to entice Satan up from hell ; hands rebel against the minds that move them ; the dead and the living couple in a Texas motel . Each story involves an uncanny mix of eroticism and terror ; each is an instance of headlong narrative . Barker , already celebrated in Britain , is about to surface in the U.S. with demonic force . The world may be ready for a combination of playwright , illustrator , film director and writer , but can it accept his eerie resemblance to Paul McCartney ? <P> THE QUICK AND THE DEAD <P> by Z. Vance Wilson <P> Arbor House ; 405 pages ; $17.95
