A study completed in 1980 said 480 , 000 juveniles were locked up that year with adults . A census taken in 1982 by the United States Bureau of Justice Statistics , working with the Census Bureau , found that on June 30 , 1982 , there were 1 , 729 juveniles in adult jails , not counting those in 48-hour lockups . Another one-day count has been taken but will not be released until next summer . Experts think the number may decline somewhat , but they say the problem is still serious and widespread. // The practice has persisted for years and is found to some extent in every state , according to the Federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention . It occurs mainly in rural areas where juvenile detention facilities are limited or nonexistent , and it risks exposing youths to exploitation and violence , experts on juvenile justice assert. // " A runaway or a mentally retarded child who is accused of no crime will be thrown into a jail with adult criminals and the child may be raped or otherwise brutalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice. // In some cases , the juveniles are put in cells with adults ; in others they are put in separate cells but may have contact with adult inmates in adjoining cells and outside the cells at meals and other times. // The juveniles range in age from 11 to 17 years , but the median age is 15 , according to figures provided by the Office of Juvenile Justice . <> <> Many Are Not Offenders // Four percent of the juveniles jailed with adults each year have been accused of no crime , according to the Federal figures ; these 19 , 000 are mentally retarded , disturbed or abused youths . Twenty percent are runaways or juveniles who have been caught drinking or who have been found to be sexually promiscuous . The majority , 65 percent , have been charged with property or misdemeanor offenses . Only one in 10 of all juveniles held in adult jails has been charged with a serious offense. // The suicide rate among juveniles in adult jails is nearly eight times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal figures. // Senator Specter and others are concerned that young people continue to end up in adult jails in spite of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act . The legislation , enacted in 1974 , required that states agree , as a condition for receiving Federal grants involving juvenile justice , to have all juveniles separated from adult prisoners within two years . The problem persisted in most states , and when the act was reauthorized in 1980 , it gave states five years to remove juveniles from adult jails . <> <> Law Up for Reauthorization // The law will be up for reauthorization again in 1984 , and concerned lawmakers , including Senator Specter and Representative George Miller , Democrat of California , are bracing for a fight with the Reagan Administration . Congress fought off efforts by the Administration , in its first three years , to end financing of the Office of Juvenile Justice. // " The existing law does not go far enough , " Senator Specter said . " There are still approximately a half a million juveniles who go to jail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills that would supersede the act . They would separate juveniles charged with crimes from adults , would prohibit the incarceration of nonoffenders , such as runaways , and would authorize Federal money to help states check jail employees ' background. // The House Select Committee on Children , Youth and Families , of which Representative Miller is chairman , recently concluded a series of five hearings around the country . " One of the recurring problems was the community ' s inability to handle the problem of juvenile delinquency , status offenses and violent offenses , " Mr. Miller said. // Only four states - North Dakota , South Dakota , Wyoming and Nevada - are not participating in the Federal juvenile program. // In 1982 New York and Connecticut reported to the Office of Juvenile Justice that they had no juveniles in adult jails , and New Jersey reported 37 . But none of the three states reports the number of juveniles held less than six hours . And in New York and Connecticut , anyone who is 16 or older and is charged with a crime would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult criminal court . <> <> Typical Route to Jail // Michael J. Dale , a Phoenix , lawyer who specializes in injury and civil rights cases , outlined a typical route juveniles take to jail : // " A cop picks up a kid in Farmington , N. M. , or St. George , Utah , or Snowflake , Ariz. , and the kid is a runaway on the way from Chicago to Los Angeles . The kid has not committed a crime , but he is a runaway . So the cop puts him in the slammer overnight or for a short period of time. // " The police officer wants to get rid of him . They don ' t like to deal with kids - they are a pain in the neck - and all of a sudden the child finds himself in a jail in a small town. " // What happens to juveniles who are incarcerated ? Some are raped , physically assaulted or exploited and a few are killed . Others are put in maximum- security cells or drunk tanks. // There are jailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give juveniles a separate facility . But even in modern jails , 20 to 30 adults might have to be transferred to accommodate two or three juveniles . As an alternative , jail officials may keep juveniles in solitary confinement or in isolated cells with little or no supervision . <> <> Death in Isolated Cell // In December 1982 , 15-year-old Robert Lee Horn of rural Oldham County , Ky. , was ordered by the local court to be held in the Oldham County Jail for truancy . After four days , he was released , but he returned the same day after arguing with his mother over money . At 11 P.M. , he was locked in an isolated juvenile cell on the jail ' s second floor . Half an hour later , he was dead . He had used his shirt to hang himself. // Mark I. Soler , director of the Youth Law Center in San Francisco who is representing the Horn family in a civil rights suit against Oldham County and local officials , contends that efforts by the Office of Juvenile Justice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan Administration. // The Administration , he said , " has communicated the idea to public officials in the states that the important thing to do is to lock up juveniles who are accused of crimes , and don ' t worry so much about compliance . " <> <> Limited Resources Cited // Alfred S. Regnery , the administrator of the juvenile justice office , said : " Critics may claim that we are not doing as much as we could , and I suppose in fairness that is probably true . But we are not doing as much as we should for a lot of things simply because we don ' t have the resources. " // His 1983 budget was $70 million . Of this , $42 million went to grants for the states and territories to help them correct problems with juvenile justice. // A ruling by Federal District Judge Helen J. Frye in August 1982 in a Portland , Ore. , case , D. B. v. Tewksbury , marked " the first time that a court has gone so far as to say that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail , " said Susan M. Svetkey , a lawyer for the plaintiffs . The judge ruled that such confinement violated the juveniles ' rights under the 14th Amendment. // Bill Treanor , executive director of the Youth Work Alliance , a coalition of 2 , 500 groups that help juveniles , said , " It ' s very poor crime control policy to be putting young people in the setting that brings them into contact with adult criminals. " // He added that in Pennsylvania " no juveniles are held in adult jails , so we know it can be done in any state . " Pennsylvania , which in 1975 had 3 , 196 juveniles confined in adult jails , had none by 1982. // //
