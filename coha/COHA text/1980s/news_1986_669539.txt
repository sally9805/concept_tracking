But first , full disclosure : Your obedient servant has in the distant past talked world affairs with a CIA agent nicknamed , for some unremembered reason , the Chocolate Banana . I have also , in more recent years , dined and talked about the world with both KGB and CIA agents and officials : among the former , the ranking KGB agent in Washington ; among the latter , two directors , two deputy directors , and the Africa department chief of the CIA . I neither received nor gave away any secrets , was not even remotely an agent . The lunches were good . They added to my store of information , some of it not before seen in print. // // These facts bear mention because it should be remembered that the professions of journalism , diplomacy , and spying run parallel a good deal of the time and occasionally intersect . If Nicholas Daniloff was doing his job well ( and he was ) , he undoubtedly encountered both CIA and KGB agents during 5 years in Moscow . Some he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But such contact doesn ' t mean he was an agent himself . For reasons detailed below , there is something approaching 100 percent certainty that he was not. // All three professions are in the business of ferreting out information . All three try to discover the most knowledgeable , shrewd , and dispassionate experts on what is going on in a competitive world and its subdivisions . All three then report their findings . There , differences emerge . Journalists expose their findings ( and any mistakes ) to readers several times a week . Diplomats needn ' t worry about disclosure except when a white paper is published a decade or two later . Spies seldom see their reports ( and mistakes ) in public print. // Of the three careers , two ( diplomacy and espionage ) sometimes occupy the same body. // To be more precise , spies sometimes have diplomatic cover and work out of embassies . Some American agents used to adopt cover as newspaper correspondents ( and did so until the early 1970s ) . And some American journalists used to engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Intelligence Agency first emerged from the chrysalis left from the wartime Office of Strategic Services , and a World War II outlook still carried over into the cold-war period. // But those days are long gone . The last serious allegations of US **29;47207;TOOLONG were disclosed in news exposes and congressional hearings in 1976 and ' 77 . Even there , a distinction should be noted : Most of the allegations pointed to an earlier period and often to nonstaff writers ( stringers who may have belonged to no one news outfit but sold to many ) . // Several things probably killed the journalist-spy combination in the US . First , some agents posing as journalists were so clumsy as to make real journalists want to distance themselves from the badly camouflaged replicas . Then , Vietnam eroded the argument for patriotic double duty . Watergate caused journalists questioning politicians ' ethics to tighten up their own standards . Correspondents began to pride themselves on rejecting conflicts of interest and paying allegiance only to their own profession and the facts . Then the CIA itself adopted rules forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , was an almost belligerent attitude that grew up in the journalism trade against such conflicts of interest. // If that chain of events presents a 95 percent certainty that Daniloff operated only for his magazine , President Reagan ' s categoric declaration to General Secretary Gorbachev that Daniloff was not a spy pushes the certainty toward the 100 percent mark . Presidents have to be very careful about lying on this subject . ( They risk their credibility with their superpower opposite number for the rest of their term . ) They also have to be careful about telling the truth . ( They may endanger policies , summits , or other individual at risk for whom they don ' t then personally vouch. ) // It should be remembered that some officials on both the US and Soviet side would have preferred that President Eisenhower lie to Nikita Khrushchev in May 1960 after U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down while doing high-altitude surveillance just before a major summit . By falsely saying he knew nothing about the U-2 operation , the argument went , Eisenhower could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to tell the truth. // Mr. Reagan must be presumed to have demanded the truth about Daniloff from CIA director William J. Casey and then decided to guarantee it in his letter to Mr. Gorbachev. // The President is now being attacked by his far right and by some neo-conservatives for having caved in by allowing both Daniloff and accused spy Gennadi Zakharov to be placed in the hands of their respective embassies . The implication from Reagan ' s detractors is that he is so eager to get summit planning back on track that he has allowed a Soviet spy to be equated with a nonspy taken hostage for the purpose of trading pawns. // Despite vehement public statements that this is not the case - and that both Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz will continue to demand Daniloff ' s unconditional release - it seems likely that both arrested men will likely be sent home eventually . Zakharov after a trial ; Daniloff perhaps after a trial , perhaps without trial. // We should not lose sight of two points. // 1 . The Daniloff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only momentarily intertwined . An important principle is at stake in the Daniloff case . But the long-term improvement of Soviet-American relations is of more major importance to many peoples around the world . Summit meetings are only the most dramatic of the many negotiations by which such improvement is grudgingly extracted from competitors who trust each other only sporadically . But summits both cause and leave behind an opening of the way for lesser negotiations to proceed. // 2 . Gorbachev may be using the Daniloff brouhaha to prove his toughness after having to give ground at , and since , his first summit last November . But he is unlikely to be directly using the affair to scuttle a summit or break off progress already made between the superpowers. // Gorbachev went on vacation Aug. 19 ( about a month later than expected ) . Zakharov was arrested Aug. 22 . Daniloff was arrested Aug. 28 . We don ' t know at what point Gorbachev ' s Politburo colleagues interrupted Gorbachev ' s vacation to fill him in on the case . But it seems most likely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back by trading for him . And it is reasonably certain that the collective leadership of the Politburo decided it would not back down and alter this system. // A feeling had grown among Moscow ' s old guard that Gorbachev had yielded a lot of ground - at the Geneva summit and in various public and private positions on arms control since then . Now it is Reagan who is being accused by his old guard of giving ground . That is the price of both leaders pay for preparing to tango. // On balance , Reagan has yielded less than Gorbachev since they warily began to dance in 1985. // //
