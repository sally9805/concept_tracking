MEET THE REPUBLICANS ' MOST VALUABLE DEMOCRAT The Democrats suspect their senator from New York of dragging his feet in the party 's 1980 presidential race . With a Republican in the White House , Daniel Patrick Moynihan might enter the 1984 contest himself  --  feet well rested for the event . by William Barry Furlong He was a dock hand who dated debutantes . He was a Hell 's Kitchen barkeep who became a Savile Row dandy . He was a liberal who was labeled a racist . Now he 's involved in the most tantalizing contradiction of all : He 's the Republicans ' most valuable Democrat . The reason : Today , at the tree-ripened age of 52 , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , a United States senator from New York , is the centerpiece in one of the most fascinating ironies of modern politics  --  he 's a Democrat who can satisfy his ambitions only if the Republicans win the presidency in 1980 . " If we do n't watch him , he might conceivably help them do it , " says one Democrat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious to help them , " says the Democrat . " He just has to keep from doing much of anything to help us . " And by doing so , prevent New York state from going into the Democratic column in the presidential election of 1980 . Could he do this ? Would he do this ? " Possibly , " says the worried Democrat . But that is  --  in justice to Moynihan  --  a long way from " certainly . " Or even " probably . " It is just that this Democrat is one of those who believes that Moynihan 's devotion to the Democratic party is less than total  --  that it is " a sometimes thing . " Interestingly , the emphasis of his colleagues and contemporaries leans more to Moynihan 's vitality and volatility , not on his stability . He 's in his fourth year in the Senate and already it 's been the longest he 's ever held exactly the same job in his life . ( " And maybe it 's just about time that he 's looking around for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Up to now , he 's lived with the reputation of being something of a gadfly , even a dilettante , repeatedly darting from one job to another ? sometimes being a presidential assistant , sometimes being ambassador to India , sometimes teaching at Harvard , sometimes running for president of the city council of New York  --  without settling into one task long enough to accomplish something lasting . Now some of his friends believe that he 's reached those years of maturity in which he must begin to do more than plan and propose , when he must begin to achieve something significant . What can he hope to accomplish ? What are his ambitions ? What does he want that can be achieved more readily if a Republican is elected president in 1980 ? Nothing , he says . He just wants to stay in the Senate for four terms or so . But somehow , not everybody believes him . " I 'd say he wants pretty much to be president . And that he 's lookin ' towards 1984 . " That 's the appraisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working day and who sees MoyniCon tinued on following page han slightly less often . Clearly Moynihan 's chances of being elected president in 1984 disappear if a Democrat wins in 1980 . Kennedy would run for reelection in 1984 . So would Brown . And Carter would be selecting the man to succeed himself  --  and it 's not likely to be Moynihan . ( Moynihan has criticized Carter and the people around him quite heavily . ) But if the Republicans win in 1980 , Moynihan has a good shot at it in 1984 , " says one astute political observer . " Simply because there 'll be no Democrat in power for the next four years , and that gives Moynihan a chance to grab attention for himself as a spokesman for the opposition . " The worried Democrat echoed that notion . And extended it . " We wo n't even give him what he wants second-best . But I think some of those Republicans will . " What does he want second-best ? " To be secretary of state . " That 's the appraisal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If he ca n't run the United States , he 'd be just as willing to devote himself to the rest of the world . " Indeed , there are some Moynihan watchers in the capital who believe he 's making a move into " influencing " foreign affairs from his seat in the Senate . When Moynihan proposed in January 1980 that Carter bring in more foreign policy advisors to augment those he already had , a good many people thought Moynihan had just the names for him . And that these people would be a " shadow staff " Moynihan planned on putting in place in the State department so that he could have a pinky in foreign policy now and could have an experienced staff already in place against the possibility he might one day be taking over as secretary of state . The idea is limited by reality . Moynihan could not become secretary of state under a Democratic president elected in 1980 . Carter would not have him in the job . Neither would Ted Kennedy . Jerry Brown conceivably could consider Moynihan but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He could never be sure when Pat might tire of State and decide he wanted the job in the Oval Office , " says one Washingtonian . But a Republican might name him , if only as the token Democrat in a Republican ' administration . Reagan has already signaled his agreement with Moynihan on a number of issues , including a hard line against the Soviets . Naming Moynihan would be important to the Republicans in another way : It would open a Democratic seat in the Senate to possible occupancy by a Republican , and that may become critical if the GOP is close to controlling the Senate for the first time in 25 years . For while another Democrat would fill the vacancy by an immediate appointment ( by a Democratic governor of New York ) , a special election for the seat would likely be held in 1981 . And a Republican  --  a Jack Kemp , perhaps , or a Henry Kissinger  --  might find that the ideal way to move into the Senate . Then the winner of the special election could run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally be up  --  with all the powers and advantages of the incumbent . There are ironies within the irony for Pat Moynihan . And for Henry Kissinger . For there is an edged feeling between these two prominent men of government , a feeling that is exacerbated by Moynihan 's desire to do Kissinger 's job ( as secretary of state ) and the possibility that Kissinger might do Moynihan 's job ( as senator ) . But it is not Kissinger alone who is Moynihan 's concern , or his target . Moynihan is considered by some  --  among them certain staffers of Teddy Kennedy  --  to be playing some sly little tricks on Ted Kennedy . There was a time when some of those staffers thought that Pat Moynihan was encouraging Ted Kennedy to run for president in 1980 . Not only was Moynihan yipping and barking at Jimmy Carter 's heels , but some of his agents were taking action in New York state to make it more difficult for Carter to win the primary there this year . But once Kennedy committed himself to the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He even went to visit him : " The Kennedys would not condescend to visit God , unless there was a vote in it , " says one awed and cynical media man . Kennedy 's visit with Moynihan resulted in Kennedy leaving empty-handed . He got nothing in the way of an endorsement or a pledge of immediate support . Indeed , stories began appearing in the paper that Moynihan was edgy because some of Kennedy 's top aides had been anti-Moynihan in the past . Moynihan himself suddenly turned around and began supporting Carter on his foreign policy stands at a time when Kennedy began to criticize him . Eventually it dawned on the Kennedy staffers : Moynihan did want Kennedy to run  --  and lose . Because if Kennedy were defeated in 1980 ? even in the nomination period  --  the party might turn to a fresh face in 1984 ? Moynihan 's face . If Kennedy happens to get the nomination and presidency , Moynihan knows that Kennedy would not only seek reelection in 1984 but would put his own man in as successor in 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the presidency until 1996 . Which is to say never . So if he wants to satisfy that particular ambition  --  or even the ambition to become secretary of state  --  he really has to drag his feet in New York in 1980 . And thus become more valuable to the Republicans . What manner of man is it who has worked himself into so singular a position in American life ? What are the pros and cons of having him as a decisive force ? What recommends him  --  if anything  --  as a presidential possibility ? Or a secretary of state ? Or even as a senator ? He is a tall man ( 6 feet , 4 inches ) , courtly , often charming , sometimes pretentious , wonderfully Irish in tongue and temperament and very much full of himself . " He likes , " says one long-time aquaintance , " to believe that he 's the main performer in a world drama , one written , produced and directed by himself . " He has wit , insight and an exceptional intelligence ? " certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says one observer , " but that is n't saying much . " He possesses an extraordinary asset for politics : He talks on the same wave-length as a vast portion of the citizenry and he has the gift of saying exactly what they think . Just one example was his performance as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . From the start , he discarded the diplomatic niceties so cherished by the State department and went right to the heart of the matter with great eloCon tin ued on following page quence as well as great force . When the diplomats of other nations became unhappy over his bluntness ( " an emotional man inclined to invent the most sensational assertions , " said Russia 's U.N . ambassador Yakov Malik ) , Moynihan simply pointed out that the U.N . was a place where hypocrisy is not only endemic but preferred . He included the numerous times Third World delegates attacked the United States with viciousness as well as zeal and then privately told the U.S. ambassador that the U.S. should not be so disturbed over the diatribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Moynihan commented , " we have been given private assurances that public obscenities were not meant . " He was seldom less than direct in following up on this view . On one occasion , the Cuban delegates to the U.N . Committee on Decolonization called for Puerto Rico to be given its independence and demanded that the U.N . send a delegation to investigate " political oppression " by the U.S. on the island . Moynihan made his opposition to the proposal very clear , and he made the reasons for it just as clear . " The Committee on Decolonization , " he said , " consists of 16 police states , four democracies and four in-betweens . We are not to be lectured by police states on the process of electoral democracy . " His reaction was so pronounced that a diplomat from a Third World nation asked one of Moynihan 's aides , " Is he threatening us ? " The aide relayed the question to Moynihan . " Tell him ' yes , ' " replied Moynihan . Debate on the Cuban proposal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chilean delegation which came to the U.N . following the fall of the communist dictator Allende was blocked by certain members of the Credentials Committee of the U.N . The reason , said those members of that committee , is that the Chileans were sent by a military government and thus did not represent the " people . " Moynihan 's response was along these lines : " Well , now , there 's an interesting question , and since you 've brought it up , we have here a list of 45 military governments and 35 other governments that were installed by military coups , and since you 're against governments like that , let 's examine all their credentials . " The Credentials Committee quickly dropped its objection to the Chilean delegation . His most famous moment was when the U.N . invited Idi Amin , the infamous president of Uganda , to address the General Assembly and Amin used the platform to call for the extinction of the state of Israel and to demand that America purge itself of " Zionists . " At about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an existing resolution which would have defined Zionism  --  the historic move to create and support an independent Jewish state in Palestine  --  as being a form of racism . Moynihan promptly made a speech that repeated a New York Times description of Amin as a " racist murderer " and said that despots like to destroy that which threatens them most  --  i.e. , democracies such as Israel . Kissinger , as secretary of state , not only felt that Moynihan had exceeded his authority in making such a statement , but he was afraid that the strong language of the speech would drive other black African nations into a show of unity and into lining up behind Amin against the United States . Moynihan was quietly given two " suggestions " for ways he could " clarify " his position . He refused them both . His firmness gratified some ; the very conservative Manchester ( New Hampshire ) Union Leader applauded his general posture in the U.N . and his " blunt speaking that has upset the cookie pushers in our State department . " Moynihan was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynics who say that he was even then looking ahead to his election to the Senate , that he was very aware of the strength of the Jewish community in New York elections . Moynihan himself protests that he did not then intend to run for the Senate , and he said on television that it would be " dishonorable to leave this post and run for any office , and I would hope that it would be understood that if I do , the people , the voters to whom I would represent myself in such circumstances , would consider me as having said in advance I am a man of no personal honor to have done so . " Having made that clear , he shortly thereafter resigned from the U.N . post and very quickly began preparing for his search for a Senate seat . To be sure , the quick turnaround by Moynihan was not unprecedented . He often has to amend his most " fundamental " statements with a " clarification " or a reversal of behavior , a fact which gives Continued on following page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1980 election . In the U.N.-to-the-Senate about-face , he may have been encouraged by the State department 's insistence that he " amend " his statements on Idi Amin . It is not on U.N . matters alone that Moynihan has spoken out with bile and candor . He has ranged through the years over a great many matters , some of which are reflected in these comments : On the nature and ambition of Soviet leaders : " No , sir , I do not think them to be mad : I think them to be evil and sane , and they seek to achieve a superiority and they know what they will do with it . They will intimidate the world around them . " On a larger federal government : " We do not need more government in America . . .. We do need more national standards , which is something federalism can produce and would be different from more government . We already have a huge amount of government , and the real task is making it work . " On meeting problems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed itself , and this will not be done by suggesting that Americans eat too much . " On the bureaucratic thirst for welfare money : " The fiscal condition of our cities has reached the point that if welfare meant a program to put arsenic in children 's milk , most municipal officials would settle for full federal funding . " On the " con " job of communist propaganda : " It is said that if a communist regime were to take over in the Sahara , there would , in time , be a shortage of sand . We shall doubtless , in time , have tested that hypothesis , but we can be fairly confident that to the very end there would be those in the West convinced that the sand had gone to build swimming pools for the rich  --  in the West . " On the gap between the ideal and the real in American life : " Am I embarrassed to speak for a lessthan-perfect democracy ? Not one bit . Find me a better one . Do I suppose that there are societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Do I think that ours is , on balance , incomparably the most hopeful set of human relations the world has ? Yes , I do . Have we done obscene things ? Yes , we have . How did our people learn about them ? They learned about them on television , in the newspapers " ? which are rarely allowed to function freely in most of those lands which criticize the United States . However much the public loves his ideas and his language , Moynihan loves them more . But sometimes he gets so carried away with his ideas  --  or himself  --  that he does n't quite know what will make him look bad in the press . During the Johnson administration , for example , he drew up a masterful 78-page report on the burdens of the black family experience in America . When parts of it were leaked to the press , he and his ideas were hailed , and the Johnson administration set about transforming his recommendations into reality . Eventually , the whole report was released and there was a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the media and in Washington chit-chat were the points that Moynihan made about what he saw as the weakening of the black family structure  --  the illegitimacy he said he perceived , the desertion rate he delineated , the deleterious effects of raising children in a female-dominated household where there is no father figure to help guide the children . To some it sounded as if Moynihan were making a hard-hitting attack on the whole black persona at precisely that time when blacks were seeking more pride and higher positions . In a short time , not only blacks but large portions of the liberal community were turning against Moynihan and all his works and all his pomps . Moynihan was indiscriminately described as a " racist " ? or worse . The Johnson administration dropped its plans to implement Moynihan 's ideas , and Moynihan found it a good time to leave government . In weighing Pat 's pros and cons , one must remember that Moynihan has a certain affection for ethnic drives , including his own . So there is a bit of the blarney in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it is just that he is a little selective in his memory . For instance , he has a standard story of how desperate his youth was , growing up with a drunken father , living in the slums of New York ( Hell 's Kitchen is his favorite slum ) and having to eke out a living shining shoes near Times Square . The story has been recounted time and again ; every newspaper and magazine that 's ever done a story on the senator has emphasized it  --  and been wrong all the way . It is not that it 's all a lie ; it is all true as far as it goes  --  but it just does n't go very far . In fact , Moynihan had a very advantaged life for the American youth of the time ; he knew an underprivileged life only a small portion of the time . And even then he was free from the ultimate knowledge of the genuinely underprivileged . His father , John Moynihan , had a good job all during the bleakest of the Depression years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Pat spent his summers with his grandparents in the open spaces of the Midwest or with friends and relatives in the resort-like atmosphere of Far Rockaway , New York . But there were problems in the home . His father , who 'd been a newspaperman before he " got rich " in the Depression  --  loved to hang around with other newspapermen . He drank with them and womanized with them and gambled with them . He fell into deep debt , and , in 1937 , when Pat Moynihan was ten years old , his father deserted the family . In time , the Moynihans had to give up their affluence ; they lived for a while on the upper East Side of New York  --  not the slums  --  and later in a number of flats on the upper West Side ( which were not as " tony " as the East Side location ) . It is true that the family had to go on welfare for a while . And it is true that Pat had to go out selling Christmas trees  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle to stay warm on the winter nights at the vacant lot ? and for a time he was shipped out to live with an aunt in Louisville to escape the street life in New York . At no time did he know the spirit-stifling reality of life in the slums : Continued on page 100 Trash to Cash continued horn page 89 with a cloth in a matching or contrasting color to brighten the to place it where it can not be knocked over , spilled on or easily stolen by some not-sowelcome guest . Some collectors go to great pains to fasten down any item they wish to keep outside a case . Keeping an object out in the open also requires more frequent cleaning and increases the risk of breakage , so it is generally not advisable . Most of the time your collection will probably be stored where it 's displayed . For those times when it has to be kept elsewhere , you should keep the following points in mind : humidity , ventilation , wrapping , protection against fire , insects and mildew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the light , temperature , humidity , ventilation and protection it requires , in general , all objects should be covered to keep dust out and should not be stored in any place where the temperature is above 72 degrees F. or below 50 degrees F. Paper items should never be covered with newspaper ; this will only ruin your collection ( newspaper attracts bugs ) . Because metal shelves conduct heat , they are not the fire protectors one might think ; if you wish to use them , cover them with felt . ( Some experts believe wooden cabinets are the best storage places ; even if they are burned on the outside , their contents often remain undamaged ) . Musical instruments require some circulation of air . Cloth items should generally be rolled rather than folded , and of course they must be protected against moths and mildew . Since practically anything can be a collectible , storage requirements vary greatly . Thorough research of your particular collection will give you more information on how best to care for it . Whatever your reason for starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to keep it going . Most people who begin to accumulate items of interest find that what started out as a hobby quickly turns into a habit . So involved do they become in their collection that it 's the first thing they turn to in their spare time . At times the act of collecting becomes more important than the collection itself . Even for those who do not become so compulsive , however , collecting can be an intensely satisfying and personally rewarding experience . It will bring you into a whole new world of people , places and things . You 'll broaden your horizons , make new discoveries and meet exciting new friends .

Moynihan continued from page 40 He did not suffer the total hopelessness , the mind-numbing lack of opportunity , the no-chance-for-escape that envelops the true slum dweller . His mother could  --  as a white woman ? get a job of sustenance far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mother could find a well-to-do man to marry , which she did . Two years or so after his father left , Pat Moynihan moved back from Louisville to join the family in living in a 14-room mansion in a I3-acre estate in plush Westchester County north of New York City . It was not a tough living by anybody 's standards  --  except perhaps the Rockefellers . But it turned out that his mother 's second marriage did n't hold up either , and she left and later divorced her second husband . Pat Moynihan again found himself living in reduced circumstances . He and his family moved into an apartment on Manhattan 's upper West Side on 92nd Street  --  not quite the pits , but not a mansion in Westchester County , either . In any case , Moynihan did get a shoe box and go down to shine shoes at 43rd Street and Broadway , outside the Paramount Theater on one side of the street , sometimes outside of Toffenetti 's restaurant on the east side of the street . But again he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : His mother found a job in a defense plant ( this was during World War II ) and soon she was able to move her family to a large airy apartment in a rambling old house in Astoria , a decent workingman 's neighborhood in Queens . One thing that Pat Moynihan does not mention in his treacly narrative of his " privation " as a youth : He was the only kid in his class who wore a tuxedo to his high school junior prom . All this is marked because of the way that Pat Moynihan edits his boyhood experience : He can not resist re-creating an Irish  --  and intellectual  --  Horatio Alger , one whose dimensions have something of the touch of the fictional , as was in the original . It would be romantic to report that Pat Moynihan dragged himself up by the dewlap and got himself the kind of higher education that turned loose the skills of a first-rate mind . But it is not altogether the truth . He started at City College of New York  --  which is taxpayer-supported and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Navy V-12 program . He went to Tufts on an ROTC program and went to graduate school on the GI bill . Thus the taxpayers in one way or another paid for his entire college education . And in a way they continued to do so : After finishing at Tufts , he got a Fulbright scholarship to the London School of Economics and Political Science  --  with living and transportation expenses included . Out of all this  --  which again is not a slum kid 's normal experience  --  Moynihan not only made the most of his education but acquired a basic perception of how one segment of society works : If a man can get into politics and government and academia and foundation-hood , hell never have to go to work for a living . That 's what Pat did : He began working for the U.S. government  --  for the Air Force  --  while he was still in England , and when he got home , he immediately began working for politicians . When he was n't working with politicians for the next 30 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges and universities . But given all this experience , can Moynihan actually run an office as demanding as that of the president or secretary of state ? No . Not in any administrative sense . " Creative chaos " is the way one sympathetic observer describes his administrative technique . Even in the Senate , where the staffs are small and can learn from generations of precedent about what to do and how to do it , he is credited with having acquired one of the poorest staffs . " Intellectuals , " says an old Senate hand , " and totally incompetent . " This is said of his top aides . The problem is that Moynihan does not give his staff any kind of leadership  --  the strong physical and intellectual leadership that Jake Javits gives his staff . ( Javits and Kennedy are regarded as having the strongest staffs in the Senate ; it is a mark of the insight of Moynihan 's staff that it likes to make fun of Javits and his staff  --  which is a little like the sandlot team making fun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staff has an immediate impact on Moynihan , for he does not have the insight to know when it 's hurting him more than it 's helping . " They make enemies of his friends without even knowing that these people are his friends , " says one staffer working for another senator . Nor can they even begin to accomplish the immensely more difficult task of making friends out of his enemies . On one occasion , a " policy king " on the staff persuaded him to " go public " in denouncing a policy of taking the ethnic balance into account when assigning teachers to classrooms in , among other places , New York City . The policy would have had blacks teaching blacks instead of having whites do it ( and perhaps letting racial tensions get in the way of the learning process ) . The policy would have had broad impact . At the very least , it might have helped more black teachers move into those brainpower jobs , which would further help blacks move into the mainstream of American life . At his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial grounds of a more curious kind  --  that it would endanger the lives of Jewish teachers in the New York City school system by taking away their historic opportunity for teaching jobs . He did not feel constrained in suggesting a line of thought that seemed to say to some that the government was purposefully denying life to Jews by giving opportunities to blacks : " Such practices evoke one image in our lifetimes above all others : the sorting out of human beings for the death camps of Hitler 's Germany . " Even for admirers of Pat Moynihan , that was a bit much . Congressman Charles Rangel , a black Democrat from Harlem , thought he detected various anti-black " code words " in the Moynihan comments , and he expressed disgust that Moynihan did n't have a deeper understanding of the issue . " I did n't expect my Democratic senator to be a party to all this , " he said . " I 'll never be able to think that he can compare this with the Germans and the Jews . " About two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarification " and " amendment " of his views  --  which could only make his Jewish constituents upset . So by relying on his staff , he got into a position where he could n't help but lose on both sides of the issue . Moynihan 's pros and cons are complicated by another characteristic : his pronounced interest in money and getting more of it . Even while he was campaigning for the Senate  --  in the year when his time was thus taken up by non-income Con tinned on page 105 Moynihan con tin ued from page 101 work  --  he earned " only " about $200,000 . ( Of this , $43,000 was from his Harvard and U.N . salaries and $152,000 was from making speeches . ) Now his salary ( from the Senate ) has risen to $60,662.50 a year , plus whatever he can earn on the outside . ( A federal law prohibits any federal employee  --  including a senator  --  from earning more than $25,000 a year from speeches , articles or public appearances outside of his federal duties . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law partnerships , investments , sales ventures  --  anything other than appearances and articles . ) So today a senator tends to see his basic salary as being $85,000 ? plus whatever he can pick up from something other than what he does best  --  which is talk and write . That is not exactly a poverty-level income . While Moynihan would n't object to raising both salary and outside income , he recognizes that has certain flaws , specifically that a senator 's taxes go up as his income goes up . The trick in the Senate is to raise one 's standard of living without raising one 's taxes . And one way to do that is to allow a senator to raise an unlimited amount of money through campaign contributions  --  hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions , of dollars  --  and then transfer that money over to his " office funds . " From there , he can use it for buying lunch or dinner with constituents or for " entertainment " or for anything else that might help him better " discover the public interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii or Acapulco or the Riviera for " public interest seminars . " It might pay for a home or condominium in the senator 's home state , decorated in the elegance to which he 's become accustomed  --  a place where he can stay while he examines the state 's " public interest . " It might pay for buying him a car for his " official " business at home or in Washington . It might buy him a number of color TVs and video recorders so that he could better follow the " public affairs discussions " on television . It could buy him anything and everything he needs to make his life more luxurious on a cost-free basis : Not only would he not have to spend his own money for the goodies , but he would n't have to pay taxes on the money he used to get them  --  since it would all be " campaign contributions " detoured to " office purposes. - The public has a different view of all this from that of members of the Senate . Some taxpayers think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some big spender to pay for some luxury in which a senator wants to indulge . When Senator Adlai Stevenson III , who was chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee until recently , proposed that the Senate bar altogether the use of " campaign contributions " for " office funds , " Pat Moynihan rose to make an impassioned speech of protest . " I am not a man of wealth ! " he exclaimed , somewhat overlooking the fact that a man who can earn $200,000 a year in part-time endeavors might be considered a man of wealth by some . " I did not win my seat by my father 's patrimony . " ( Perhaps he was talking about the way that the three Kennedy brothers got to the Senate . ) All he really wanted was to go out and ask his backers for " office money . " But this proposal by Adlai Stevenson would bar him from this high dignity : " I am told , " he concluded , " I can not even be a mendicant . I am told 1 must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He kept from breaking out into hysterical laughter about the $200,000-a-year pauper . All he did was rise to suggest that " all beggars line up on the side of the senator from New York . " All of this comes together in a particular system which establishes Moynihan as a beggar  --  from the non-rich . He or his aides indulged in a classic tactic of wheedling pennies for his purse : the " legal kickback . " Laughter rippled through Capitol Hill last Christmas when it was reported that Moynihan was not having much success in getting $1-a-head kickbacks from his staff for a " gift " for the senator . There is something terribly disturbing and pathetic about a man who earns anywhere from $85,000 to $200,000 seeking $1-a-head kickback gifts from the secretaries and clerks and receptionists on his staff . The whole incident is deeply upsetting to those who believe that a senator should be above all crime , much less petty crime . On the same level of inquiry , Moynihan has been facing specula-tion  --  even in the August New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moynihan began drinking hard liquor before he was a teen-ager . He 's been drinking more than regularly ever since . The meaning of all this is seasoned by the particular mores of the capital : In Washington , drinking is not considered even noticeable  --  much less a problem  --  unless a senator is falling-down drunk before breakfast . or at least before the gavel falls that calls the Senate into session around noontime . All this would not be a question if Moynihan were a private Continued on page 115 Moynihan continued from page 105 citizen , if he were not in the Senate or not considered a possibility for president or secretary of state . But since he is not in private life , it is brought up from time to time , even by sympathetic sources . For instance , the New York Times , a publication which paid dearly to be a friend and supporter of Moynihan 's ( the editor of its editorial page resigned when the Times supported him for senator ) raised the question . In an article in 1979 , it brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drinks during the day  --  enough to affect his performance . " The Times ' conclusion was curious in that it brought up the question as if it were important and then dismissed it as if it were not : " Moynihan denies it , and there is absolutely no evidence that his pleasures begin before the end of the workday. - Of course , the Times may have been condemning Moynihan by indirection ; it might be inferred from the Times article that he does drink heavily after his workday ends . And a senator can end his workday whenever he pleases ? at breakfast if he chooses . The point is that the workday of a president never quite ends ; he must have a clear and unbefuddled mind at all times of the day or night , for the climactic decisions he must make are not guaranteed to fall into the 9-to-5 workday  --  or even the 12-to-3 workday of a good many senators . A more sobering question  --  and a most curious insight  --  is that Pat Moynihan has been working in various levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of his plans or proposals has ever been turned into an action program . It is not that he wanted it this way ; he would like to have a few monuments in the social programs of the nation named after him . He 's come moderately close several times . Once was when the Johnson administration came to a screeching halt on implementing his thoughts on the black family in America ; another time was when the Nixon administration sent his Family Assistance Plan to Congress and watched it die there . About the only thing he 's really accomplished is to get New York more and more on the dole ? and this may be considered a negative , not a positive . For the American people outside of New York do not enjoy the prospect of paying all the costs ? welfare , transit , education , public safety , pollution reduction , garbage collection  --  of anything and everything that the residents of New York City do Continued on following page not want to support out of their own pockets . It would seem a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it can get back on its feet and not have to be carried by the rest of the country . Most articles on Moynihan do not offer the balanced view of his liabilities as well as his assets . Certainly his assets are many and attractive , particularly in a public official : As we 've seen here , he has an exceptional mind , ideas that are on the same track as a large part of the national constituency , the eloquence to express his ideas well and the courage to support them in a hostile atmosphere . These are all valued assets in a potential president or secretary of state ; they are valued assets in a United States senator . The question is whether and how the Republicans can make the most of his value to them . It is not enough to express the obvious  --  that Moynihan can more readily achieve his personal ambitions ( and his political ones ) if a Republican is elected in 1980 . This is not going to make him switch parties ; that would end all his hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill  --  called subtlety  --  that is unfamiliar to Moynihan . For he must drag his feet creatively in New York state to let that state 's electoral votes be thrown to the Republicans . It can not be done obviously . If he does it at all , he can not announce that he 's doing it or betray in any manner that this is his intent . That would simply make the Democrats mad at him and end his future in the party . It is all the more difficult because New York appears to be strongly Democratic right now and it may be impossible for him to change that sentiment . Further , it may go against his every instinct . But there is an example he might study  --  within the Republican party . In 1976 , Ronald Reagan dragged his feet very creatively and did it on a national level . Nobody within the GOP seemed to hold it against him  --  except perhaps President Ford . Reagan 's foot-dragging helped dump Ford , a Republican , from the White House and put Democrat Jimmy Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan to go for the presidency in 1980 . And though he was a foot-dragger in that presidential race , he immediately became the favorite among Republicans to win in 1980 . That would be very instructive to somebody who has designs on 1984 . His ambition for the future is not the only matter at stake for Moynihan . There is also his seat in the Senate . If the Democrats sweep everything presidential in 1980 , that may be all he has left to him . And he 'll have to put it up for election in 1982 . Obviously the GOP has several strong candidates who might go against him  --  Jack Kemp , for example , as well as Henry Kissinger . Moynihan knows  --  as does every member of the Senate  --  that half of all the senators who had tough opposition lost their seats in 1976 and 1978 . Times have changed : it is no longer like the old days when a man went to the Senate and might expect to stay there all his life . So with opposition of the caliber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elections of 1982 , he has no job at all . That points up the ultimate irony within the irony : that Pat Moynihan is not only the Republicans ' most valuable Democrat in 1980 , but that the Republicans are Pat Moynihan 's party of opportunity . And security . A Pella continued from page 98 " Yes , " I said . " What 's it all about ? " " It does n't mean anything , " the man said .
