AT FIRST GLANCE , the aircraft looks like it might have been accidentally turned around halfway through the assembly line . It has a conventional set of wings emerging from the fuselage and sweeping rearward . But extending from its vertical tail fin is a second set of wings that sweep forward and join the conventional wings . Seen from above , the two sets of wings form a diamondlike shape . The strange plane is no accident . It is called a joined-wing aircraft and is one of the most radical changes in aircraft design since the single-wing monoplane replaced the two-wing biplane in the early 1930s . In theory , the joined-wing aircraft can fly farther or carry more passengers or cargo than a conventional single-wing plane of comparable size . It promises considerable savings for business aircraft , medium-sized commercial airliners and military transports , aeronautical engineers say . After more than five years of computer simulations and model testing , both the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Navy have become convinced that the joined-wing plane will live up to its theoretical promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASA is expected to contract with the patent holder of the design , ACA Industries Inc. , a small aeronautical consulting firm in Torrance , Calif. , for a program aimed at getting a full-size joined-wing demonstrator in the air by late 1987 or early 1988 . " All the studies so far indicate there are no stoppers ( to a practical joined-wing airplane ) , " says David J. Peake , chief of advanced aerodynamic concepts at NASA ' s Ames Research Center at Moffett Field , Calif . The joined wing is the brainchild of ACA ' s founder , Julian Wolkovitch , a 53-year-old , British-born aeronautical engineer who emigrated to the U.S. in the late 1950s and became noted for his work on vertical and short take-off and landing ( V/STOL ) aircraft . The inventor says he conceived the joined-wing plane in the mid-1970s when he decided , as a hobby , to build a one-person glider that was safer than the kitelike hang gliders that were the new rage . " I called it the married man ' s hang glider , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their tips for structural strength . With the pilot sitting midship , the forward wings also served as a crash barrier . THE GLIDER PROVED too cumbersome for hang-gliding enthusiasts . But when the engineer sat down at his computer to analyze the glider ' s aerodynamics , he got a surprise . " It dawned on me that ( with the joined wing ) you get a lighter , stiffer structure , " he says . He soon realized the joined wing recaptures some of the attributes of the old biplane . Engineers had to abandon the biplane because the support struts and wires between the two wings offered too much air resistance at the higher aircraft speeds of the 1930s . One penalty of adopting the monoplane was that the single wing had to be heavily braced . In modern planes the single wing is braced internally by a long , heavy metal box that runs down the wing at its thickest part . The box doubles as a fuel tank . In the joined-wing plane , however , the rear wings brace the forward wings and internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus the fuselage ) may be as much as 30% lighter than the wing-plus-tail assembly on a conventional craft , says NASA ' s Mr. Peake . Mr. Wolkovitch , with the enthusiasm typical of an inventor , calculates that if the weight saved by the joined wing were replaced by fuel , the range of a twin-engined transport would be 40% farther than its present 1 , 500 miles . THE JOINED WING also has another advantage of the old biplane . When a wing deflects flowing air downward to get an upward lift , it also creates a reaction that tries to push the wing backward , a force engineers call " induced drag . " The old biplane , by dividing the lift between two wings , had considerably less induced drag than a monoplane with the same lifting power . Thus , it could go farther than a monoplane on a gallon of gas . The joined-wing craft similarly has a lower induced drag than a comparable monoplane , Mr. Wolkovitch says . And it doesn ' t have the old biplane ' s obstructing struts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a monoplane , further reducing its weight and adding to its range or cargo-carrying capacity . The major question left is whether the joined wing has any unexpected handling problems in actual flight , says NASA ' s Mr. Peake . To answer this , after several months of full-scale wind tunnel tests and ground simulations , NASA will put joined wings on one of its research planes and put it in the air , Mr. Peake says . Meanwhile , in Denton , Texas , tiny Summit Aircraft Corp. already has built and flown a one-person ultralight joined-wing prototype . " It seemed to handle real well and it was incredibly stable , " says Summit President Roland Schmitt . But its biggest advantage , he says , harks back to Mr. Wolkovitch ' s original idea . The pilot , instead of sitting out in front as he does in most ultralights , sits just behind the main forward wings of the joined-wing craft , Mr. Schmitt explains . There , the wings provide a protective crash barrier . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
