The history of radio for the visually impaired started with a domestic dilemma back in the late ' 60s , when C. Stanley Potter , a blind Minnesotan , couldn ' t persuade his wife to read him the sports pages . Oh , he could pick up brief tidbits about the latest Vikings victory from local radio or television . But Mrs. Potter ' s complete lack of interest in the exploits of Fran Tarkenton left him hungry for the chance to savor the sports section over a morning cup of coffee , just like everybody else . Not long afterward , the beleagured Potter was forced to listen to interminable minutes of piped-in Muzak while waiting in a checkout line at the grocery store . Wouldn ' t it be nice , Potter asked himself , to listen to something interesting instead of this stuff ? " That ' s when the idea came to him for a radio station that would broadcast current information to people who couldn ' t read themselves , " says Laura Long , the station manager for the Chicagoland Radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasts 24 hours a day , 7 days a week to the visually impaired . Since the original station began broadcasting in St. Paul in 1969 , Potter ' s brainstorm has gone on to spawn about 120 other reading stations nationwide , including CRIS , which started 1980 . They feature verbatim readings from at least 30 newspapers and magazines a week , and helpful programming for its highly specific audience . In fact , not just anybody can tune into CRIS for a slice of the Wall Street Journal on the way to work . The station , whose signal is carried on the subcarrier of WBEZ-FM , is closed-circuit and inaccessible to the public . Listeners must submit a doctor ' s certification that they need the service . Then , after a period on a waiting list that can last as long as nine months , they are lent special , single-channel receivers . " We have about 150 people on our waiting list now because we can ' t raise the money fast enough to buy the receivers , " Long says , " The FCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we think the service should be free and available to the people who need it , not just the ones who can buy it . " The station , which broadcasts from the Chicago Public Library at 400 N. Franklin St. , is staffed by 6 paid employees and an estimated 500 volunteers-about 120 of whom do the bulk of the reading . " Our volunteers don ' t have to sound like Walter Cronkite , " Long says , " but they have to sound pleasant , and read the news in an interpretive manner without slanting it . " CRIS begins its broadcast day at 6 a. m. , with two syndicated hours of articles from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal . From 8 : 04 a. m. , until noon , local volunteers read sections from Chicago ' s two major daily newspapers , including the classified ads and the comics . Last Thursday , Bill Jacklin , the Du Page County Auditor , and Gene Larson , who works for Encyclopaedia Britannica , sat in a CRIS broadcast booth , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read the Christian Science Monitor . " We ' ve become good friends , but we ' re definitely not encouraged to develop a rapport on the air , " Larson says . " We ' re here to read . I ' d say we get through about 20 articles during the course of an hour . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by George Thompson . Cherlye Dobinker volunteers time reading to visually impaired .
