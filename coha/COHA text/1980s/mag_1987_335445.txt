After a week of fighting , Sri Lankan troops had battled their way up Jaffna Peninsula , ousting ethnic Tamil separatists from a number of strongholds in the northern tip of the island nation . The cost was high : as many as 200 civilians believed dead and thousands more left without food . But , said a high-ranking official in Colombo , the capital , " we were winning . " <P> Suddenly , in an unambiguous show of support for the rebels , the Indian government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi , which up until then had been trying to mediate the civil war , dispatched 19 fishing boats laden with food and medical supplies across the Palk Strait to the battle zone . Condemning the shipment as interference in its internal affairs , Sri Lanka sent naval vessels to interdict the convoy , which was turned back after a tense confrontation in mid-strait . <P> Undeterred , Gandhi ordered five of the Indian air force 's Soviet-built An- 32 transports , escorted by four French-built Mirage-2000 fighter jets , into Sri Lankan airspace to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colombo immediately charged that the airlift was a " naked violation of Sri Lanka 's sovereignty and independence . " India insisted that the move was needed to meet the " continuing deterioration " of Sri Lanka 's Tamils , a condition Colombo denies . <P> India 's decision to intervene so visibly in the civil war apparently slowed the Sri Lankan government 's military campaign . Though Tamils make up only 18% of the island 's 16 million people , the separatist guerrillas have found support and safe haven among the 50 million Tamils living across the strait in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu . Last week 's airlift seemed to indicate that Gandhi was giving in to pressure from Indian Tamils to intervene more actively in Sri Lanka . Said an official in Colombo : " Whatever India may say about humanitarian aid , what they actually wanted was a halt to the offensive . They have done that . " <P> Unable to provide the swift military victory demanded by the island 's Buddhist Sinhalese majority , Sri Lankan President Junius Jayewardene may now try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he will surely try to avoid provoking a military response that would topple him from power . He also faces the problem of preventing Sinhalese anger from erupting into bloody race riots , such as those in which an estimated 1,000 Tamils were massacred in 1983 . " Rajiv Gandhi may have acted out of domestic compulsion , " said a Sri Lankan official , " but he does n't seem to realize that he has taken this country to the brink of disaster .
