As divorce rates rise and young people wait longer to get married , more and more Americans are living and eating alone . Rather than sit down to a feast each night , they often choose to heat and eat a Lean Cuisine or Le Menu frozen dinner . Now comes a convenient appliance in which to cook such solitary repasts : the Half Pint microwave oven . Made by Japan 's Sharp Electronics , this compact cooker is small enough ( 13 in. by 13 in. ) to fit snugly into the tiniest studio apartment . It will bake a potato in six minutes , only a tad slower than the four minutes that a typical full-size microwave takes . / <P> Priced at $129 , the Half Pint is selling well to all kinds of customers who are short on kitchen space , from college students living in dormitories to camping enthusiasts who like to have hot meals in their recreational vehicles .

" Since the small oven was introduced in the U.S. seven months ago , Sharp has sold about 250,000 Half Pints , compared with only 50,000 of its most popular full-size microwave .
