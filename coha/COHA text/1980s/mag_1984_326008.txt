" Let the good times roll ! " exulted Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards when he opened the World 's Fair in New Orleans last May . Alas , the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition has seen nothing but hard times . The fair has been losing $1 million a week ; average daily attendance has been 40,000 , a sorry response to the spring predictions of 70,000 . And last week the fair defaulted on a $40 million bank loan by failing to make its $450,000 monthly interest payment . The festival on the levee has no chance of breaking even , but New Orleans has Beleaguered exposition agreed to postpone collecting city taxes from the exposition to enable the fair to limp to its scheduled closing date , Nov. 11 , instead of folding early . <P> Why did the World 's Fair fail so abysmally ? Some blame a poor marketing strategy , others the $15 admission price . It may also be that the attraction of the onetime , small-scale exposition is over , outmoded by well-promoted , futuristic extravaganzas like Walt Disney 's Epcot Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , it could be that the Knoxville World 's Fair of two years ago , though financially successful , was so boring it discouraged people from going to New Orleans .
