The masochistic middle-aged climber stands panting into the gaping dark , wondering what in God 's name he is doing here . He is 17,000 ft. up , with 1,650 ft. still to go to the top . The temperature is unreasonably far below zero , hands and feet are numb , and the air is so thin that a few tentative steps leave the body screaming for relief . Perhaps this is how Hans Meyer felt when , 100 years ago , the German geologist became the first to ascend to the rarefied heights of Mount Kilimanjaro , an immense dormant volcano 49 miles long and 24 miles wide that straddles the border between Tanzania and Kenya . Or the myriad of tourists who have since gasped their way to the roof of Africa . <P> What can the attraction be ? It is , after all , a three-day uphill trek to the foot of the final peak , and then a predawn slog of two practically vertical miles to the top . On the way , walkers are alternately roasted by the tropical sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlighted huts , wash in ice-cold water and , after five days , emerge from the mountain dirty , haggard and exhausted . " Maybe the only satisfaction comes from looking back on it afterward , " suggests climber Matt Claman , 29 , a lawyer from Juneau . <P> The largest number of the 10,764 tourists who climbed the mountain last year came from the U.S. That can be blamed on Hemingway , says Iain Allan , a mountain climber whose Nairobi company arranges treks up Kilimanjaro , mostly for Americans . " Americans were brought up on his short story The Snows of Kilimanjaro , and they simply have to come and see for themselves . " What they find is not one but two forbidding peaks : gaunt , craggy Mawenzi and snowcapped Kibo , the summit that looms over Harry , Hemingway 's gangrenous protagonist , " wide as all the world , great , high , and unbelievably white in the sun . " <P> The most popular route up Kibo , known somewhat disparagingly as the tourist route , is , as British climber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kilimanjaro National Park charges an entrance fee of about $150 a person for the climb , which begins at park headquarters in Marangu , Tanzania . For the guides , porters and food for the five-day trek , Marangu 's two hotels charge an additional $250 a person . And do n't forget generous gratuities . Money is constantly on the minds of the porters , who see each climb as a test of how large a tip they can extract from their clients ( " Bwana , give me your boots when we finish our safari " ) . These young members of the Wachagga tribe , who spend much of the year working on coffee plantations , saunter upward , balancing 30-lb. sacks of climbers ' gear on their heads . Some haul large green wooden boxes of provisions , water jugs  --  and even live chickens . <P> The climbers , a motley assembly of shorts and sneakers , knickers and mountain boots , start out with cheerful hearts over a gentle , 5 1/2-mile path through rain forest to Mandara , a " village " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 7 1/2-mile upward trudge through moorland to the Horombo complex of huts . Both sites were developed by the Norwegians as an aid project in the early 1970s . Today they could do with a little redevelopment .
