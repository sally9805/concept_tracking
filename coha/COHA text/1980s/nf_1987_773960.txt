txt // to-do section . Consulted on a daily basis , this section fed my daily action plan . Every day I 'd take one or two things off the to-do list and add them to my daily action plan . But it was n't until I met Dr. Hobbs that I learned I was not using my calendar section to its full potential . He taught me that not only should dates , deadlines , appointments , and a to-do list be recorded , but all information that comes to me can be and should be recorded in the calendar section of the planning notebook . Here are some examples of what I mean : 1 . You receive a wedding invitation in the mail . Let 's pretend the wedding is on February 7 . Flip ahead in your calendar to February 7 and record all pertinent information : the time and place of the wedding , and the time and place of the reception , and so on . Now flip to the running to-do section and add this item to the list : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then throw the invitation away . 2 . The Gastronomical Gourmet is whipping up Potatoes Good-Woman Style on TV . The recipe sounds delicious , nutritious , and fast , and you just have to add it to your repertoire . Instead of reaching for the back of an envelope , a corrected spelling test , or a magazine cover , or running to the kitchen for a recipe card , you grab your planning notebook ( which is always close by , of course ) and open it to today 's date . Record the recipe and then flip to the running to-do section and add this to the list : " Try Potatoes Good-Woman Style ( Jan. 15 ) . " The numbers in the parentheses are today 's date , telling you that the recipe can be found on the January 15 calendar page . 3 . One spring afternoon , your son comes home from school with a sheet telling you about baseball sign-ups . Let 's say sign-ups will be held every Saturday in April at the Community Center from 10:00 A.M. to 2:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical insurance policy number and a doctor 's completed physical examination form when the child is registered . Once again , open your calendar to today 's date and briefly write down all the information . Turn to your // running to-do section and add this to the growing list : " Baseball sign-ups in April on Saturdays ( Mar. 18 ) . " Remember , Mar. 18 is the date where the information about baseball sign-ups is recorded in your calendar . Then throw away the original paper , the one your son brought home . 4 . You 're on a lunch break and everyone is buzzing about a new Thai restaurant that opened up last weekend . You love Thai food and want to record all the details . What do you do ? Reach for a " While You Were Out Today " pad ? No . Open your planning notebook to today 's date and jot the name and address of the restaurant and anything else you learn , such as price range , business hours , and party accommodations . Then in the running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( April 17 ) . " Now , do n't argue . I can feel your resistance . You 're wondering why you should record that information about the wedding or the baseball sign-ups . Would n't it just be easier to keep the original paper than to waste time rewriting everything in the planning notebook ? Excuses , excuses ? and I thought we took care of that problem chapters ago ! Think about it . Putting the paper away , shuffling around it in the meantime , and finding it again ( hopefully before the deadline ) will take a lot longer and cause a lot more mental stress than writing it once and forgetting about it until it comes up on your calendar . Just try it and prove it to yourself . You have to attend a staff meeting next Tuesday . Whenever you think of a subject for discussion or a question you want answered , you reach for separate pieces of scratch paper and keep them on your desk spindle until meeting time . Right ? Wrong . Open your calendar to next Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of items you want to bring up . Every time you think of something else , add it to the list . When the day of the meeting arrives , you 'll be efficiently prepared . No searching for notes or reminders and no forgetting an important point . This same idea works for trips or vacations . Start a totake list on the date you 'll be packing for the trip . Whenever // you think of something you must take with you , add it to the list . When packing day rolls around , voila ! There 's your list of things to bring , ready and waiting for action . Your oldest son is a busboy at the Miyako Restaurant . Your younger son asks , " Mom , what 's a busboy ? " After explaining the job description , your little boy says with a laugh , " I thought a busboy was a guy who met people as they got off the bus and tried to get them to eat at the Miyako . " Where do you record all the cute things the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when they say their first words ? Where do you write the details and feelings you experience after an especially trying day , or the joys you share after a hard-fought victory ? Yes , you guessed it . You record these things in the calendar section of your planning notebook . It 's the perfect place to make diary or journal entries . Here are some more examples : You 're cleaning out the basement , and you find Marilyn 's folding chairs that you borrowed on New Year 's Eve . You toss the chairs into the car and return them to Marilyn . A few hours later you notice the nozzle has blown off the end of the hose . You put the hose in the car and head to the garden center for the needed repair . Later , stumbling over Jim 's Big Wheel ( Jim , by the way , is fourteen now ) , you think maybe little Benjie down the street would like to have it . So you toddle down the road and win Benjie 's undying love and devotion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd say you 're batting 1,000 . In other words : wrong , wrong , wrong . Here 's why : You should clean with your calendar ! Put Marilyn 's chairs in the corner and make a note in your running to-do list to return them to her . Wait . Hold it right there . All of a sudden you remember that you 're going over to Marilyn 's Thursday afternoon to see her new diningroom set . Instead of lengthening the running to-do list , just turn to Thursday 's page in your calendar and write " Return Marilyn 's folding chairs . " That way you 're beginning to build // Thursday 's daily action plan in advance . And when Thursday rolls around , you 're automatically reminded to return the chairs . As for the hose , put it where it belongs and add a note on the running to-do list that it needs to be repaired . Then put the Big Wheel beside the folding chairs and write in your calendar another reminder ( or ask one of your kids to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this method , it 's easy to see how you have shaved hours from basement cleaning time . Clean with your calendar . ( Or , use your head to save your heels ! ) Now you can see why I use a two-pages-per-day calendar format . The left-hand page houses the daily action plan , dates , deadlines , and appointments . The right-hand page holds everything else : journal or diary entries , recipes , vacation totake lists , meeting notes , baseball sign-up information , and so forth . Basically , the right-hand sheet is just a blank piece of paper for me to use as I wish . When this sheet is filled , I slip in an add-in sheet , which is just another piece of paper to write on . ( If you put add-in sheets in the calendar section , be sure to date them , since dates become the reference source . ) If you 're working in a nonmanagement position that requires few , if any , business notes , a one-page-per-day or week-at-aglance format may be adequate . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I plan my days the night before . However , when to plan is a personal decision . I prefer evenings over mornings because I 've found that in the morning I plan under pressure . I need to get the kids up , dressed , fed , and out the door . Ditto for me ! The phone rings , the baby cries , the beds are unmade . My inclination at that point is to get busy . Planning can wait . However , in the evening I 'm more objective and can see what jobs are truly important . Instead of just getting busy with whatever , I plan according to longterm considerations . I take a few minutes at the end of the day to review what I have done and to evaluate my performance . If my plans // have gone awry , I ask myself why . Then I compare the way I have actually used my time with the way I intended to use it . If the day has been a disaster , I think of things I could have done to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that have come along that have thrown a wrench in my plans . Usually , I discover that it 's my own lack of prioritizing and sticking to my priorities that gets me in trouble . Next , I decide what I must get done tomorrow . I look at any dates , deadlines , and appointments I have scheduled and determine how much time I have to work with . If I 'm going to be in a meeting all day , my daily action plan will be fairly short . On days when I have several hours to work with , my list is considerably longer . Then I check my goals section and ask , " What can I do today to bring that goal out of the future and a little closer to realization ? " Since I 'm working a physical fitness goal , " aerobic video " is part of my daily action plan . Improving my level of spirituality is also a goal , so " pray and read scriptures " are two more items noted on the to-do list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many goal activities as possible . Then I check the running to-do list and select a few of those jobs . Since I 'm going to the mall this afternoon , I can pick up the wedding present for Steve and Sally . I 'll call Judy and see if she wants to meet me for lunch at the Thai Foon Restaurant . Since I 'll be driving past the garden center , I 'll also get the hose fixed . All of a sudden , three things have been checked off the running to-do list . Now , referring to my housekeeping schedule , I list any household jobs that need to be taken care of . If I 'm delegating any of those chores , I also note the initials of the assigned person . That way I can more effectively follow through to see if the job has been done . It 's also a relief to see something on the list that I do n't have to worry about . So , there 's your list in a neat linear line written on your calendar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way // down . But first do you do something easy just to get it out of the way , and then make a few phone calls ? No ! No ! No ! First , take a look at your list . Some of the tasks will be maintenance activities that just keep you caught up ( such as housework , fixing the hose ) while others will be achievement activities ( prayer , reading scriptures , aerobic exercise ) . If your list is filled with maintenance activities only , take some of them off and replace them with at least one achievement task . Filling their days with nothing but maintenance chores is probably the main reason many women do not feel fulfilled at home . It 's the maintaining we do day in and day out that discourages us and makes us feel overwhelmed . Maintenance is vital , though . It keeps things running smoothly and adds to a pleasant feeling of contentment at home . But over-maintenance is deadly . If you overdo it , people will go somewhere else when they want to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members exactly as they are ? dirty shoes and all . Our homes need to be welcoming and inviting too . Now , where do you draw the line ? Here 's what I do . One year we were having an office Christmas party at our house . Everything will be perfect , I dreamed . I planned a two-week cleaning spree to organize every closet , every cupboard , every drawer . There would not be found so much as a cobweb hanging from a single stud in the basement . The storage boxes would be neatly stacked and organized , the filing caught up , the snow blower polished . And so I planned . Then reality ( and the Christmas season ) hit with full force . Brian made the basketball team . Drive to practices , attend games . Jim , Jr. , who does n't drive , got a job twenty minutes away from home . More driving . Christmas shopping . Holiday baking . Steven 's band concert . My job . Rehearse for the Christmas program at church . Make gifts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top it off , I needed to clean the basement , file , scrub , organize , and entertain . I was getting tense and anxious and was snapping at Jim and the kids . I could n't have been under more pressure had I been asked // // to repaint the Sistine chapel . What was I doing to myself ? " OK , " I said to myself , " what 's my goal ? " Since the party preparations were causing me the most stress and pressure , I started with that one . " I want everyone to have a good time and to feel welcomed , " I replied . " I want to be an efficient but warm hostess . I want the house to be neat enough so as not to embarrass us . " What did filing have to do with my goal ? What about the storage boxes ? The cobwebs in the base-ment ? The kids ' closets ? NOTHING . So , I altered my original plan to suit my goal . The pres-sure was lifted . We had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement looked like a garage sale in progress . Here 's my point : Perfection is only necessary when it directly relates to a goal . Suppose I was taking a group of people through my home to demonstrate how a home should be cleaned and organized . In that case , my original party-cleaning plan would be necessary . Sure , I still need to clean my basement and catch up on the filing , but now I 've sched-uled those chores for the week after I 've finished this manu-script . Whenever I run out of day before I run out of list , I ask , " What 's my goal ? " and I go for the most important and directly related tasks . Let 's look at the item on my list that reads " Make gifts for the children in my Sunday School class . " Now , there are ten children in that class , and making gifts for each child would take a lot of time . What was my goal ? I wanted to give each of the children a present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the gifts have to be handmade ? No . Thus , I set my goal : buy the gifts . Now , if my goal had been " Make Christmas gifts for my Sunday School class so their parents will be impressed with my handiwork and realize how much time I spend on those kids , " then handmade gifts would have been important . Or , it the goal had mentioned saving money , handmade gifts would likely have been one way to meet that requirement . Imagine two pint jars sitting side by side . The jar on the left contains three golf balls , representing your goal or achieve-ment activities . The jar on the right is three-fourths full of popcorn kernels , representing all the maintenance activities you do repeatedly every day . If you take the golf balls out of their jar and try to put them into the jar with the popcorn , they wo n't fit , will they ? But try it the other way and see what happens . Put the golf balls back into their jar and pour the kernels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kernels and the balls fit in the same container . In other words , if the achievement activities are done first , there will still be room for the maintenance activities ? at least for the most important ones . I do n't want to belabor the point . Just remember , when you 're stressed out , to step back , look at your list , and ask , " What 's my goal ? " Then eliminate the excess baggage . Any jobs that do n't directly contribute to the desired and ultimate outcome should be cast aside ? at least for now . To keep yourself on track , number the entries on your daily action plan in the order they should be done and check them off as they 're completed . Items left unfinished can be assigned to another day or returned to the running to-do sec-tion , if you 're not sure when you 'll be able to get to them . Nailing things down in writing is requisite to a functional time-management system . Plan ahead . Assign priorities . Keep track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily action plan . Review your time use . Your best moments are when you feel in control . Follow this simple time-management program and enjoy days on end of feeling on top of things . You will discover greater freedom and relaxation and develop a large measure of con-trol over your time and your destiny . As free time begins to unfold , you 'll notice that it is unclouded by the uneasy aware-ness of tasks undone and anxiety about the future . It 's just common sense that planning ca n't help but bring you more of what you want in life . 6 Many Hands Make Light Work Learn to Delegate Delegation . The word evokes myriad images ? tears , tantrums , and threats . Turbulence , tattling , and tension . Nothing , save the word no , elicits such a response from children . And it 's that dreaded reaction that keeps fainthearted folks ( like me ) from delegating chores in the first place . But delegate we must . Directing the heavy traffic created by housework and homework , kids and careers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Fonda-fit body ? it 's no wonder things often get lost in the scramble , such as your time , your mental health , and perhaps a navy blue sandal or two . Yes , today 's lifestyles make delegating obligatory . Why , even a big wheel needs spokes. 58 // Now I was going to wait awhile before making this astounding declaration , but I can hold back no longer . It 's excruciating . It 's like knowing Mary Poppins is looking for work , having her phone number , and never calling it . Take a look at today 's action plan and ask yourself , " Do each of these jobs need to be done by me or do they just need to be completed ? " That , in a nutshell , is the very cornerstone of delegation : realizing that you do n't have to do it all . Many people think that effective time management means doing everything faster so you can squeeze it all in . Not so . I know , I know . If we could only convince the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little secret . Most likely everyone in your home thinks the housework is your work , your responsibility . And how do I know that ? Because I used to be a kid once too . I was reared in a family of six children , and as a result , there was always a lot that needed to be done around the house . Every Saturday morning I was the last kid on the block to get outside to play , because my housework had to come first . Every Saturday morning I would mumble as I dusted , mumble as I straightened my chest of drawers , and mumble as I dried dishes . " If she ( meaning Mother ) did n't want to do this stuff , why did she get married in the first place ? " Now , as an adult , I am ashamed of those feelings , yet very grateful for a mother who let me mumble and grumble to my heart 's content , for I learned two important lessons : I work before play , and I let my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother always said : " You get back what you dish out . " ) I know you 're an intelligent person . You do n't need a lecture and an itemized list giving you the rules of effective delegation . What you do need , though , are a few ideas to help you break down the wall of resistance that stands between you , the delegator , and your child , the delegatee . The most important ingredient is to foster an atmosphere of cooperation . Stay off the child 's back . Do n't harp . Do n't // nag . Do n't play the martyr . Be positive in your approach . " Mom , will you help me with my campaign posters ? " " Sure , I 'd love to . But I need to finish these few things on my list first . If you want to help I 'll be done sooner . " Or , " Mom , Matt and I want to go bowling . Can you drive us down and pick us up too ? " " Steven , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much free time , I 'll be glad to give you and Matt a ride . " We have to let our children know that we have the time to help them because they 've helped us . They do n't automatically understand that . We need to let them know that there 's a direct correlation between our availability and their cooperation . Whenever possible , get the children mentally prepared for what lies ahead . That is a stellar reason for using the planning sheets recommended in chapter 5 . The children preagree to everything listed on those sheets and know a week in advance what is expected of them during the week . How much cooperation do you breed in a situation like this : Susan walks in the front door after school and announces , " A bunch of us are going to McDonald 's . We 'll be back in an hour or so . " " Not so fast , young lady . You 're not leaving this house until I can see the floor in your bedroom . And that includes the floor under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known a week in advance that she had to clean her room she could have made different plans with her friends , or she could have cleaned the room sooner than you required . Planning sheets eliminate a lot of unnecessary prodding . When your children ask if they can go outside and play , say simply , " Go check your planning sheet and see if everything is done . " For children who ca n't read , draw simple pictures , cut out photos from magazines , or assign an older child to read their assignments to them . // Another way to nurture this cooperative spirit is to explain your methods for doing things . When family members can see and understand your logic rather than assume it 's idiosyncrasy , they are more likely to cooperate . Here 's an example . We store little storybooks in a large plastic dishpan . The books are standing up with the covers facing forward , which permits the child to flip through the collection and pull out the book of his choice without having to dump the trove all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years until our daughter , Schuyler , started toddling around . By the time she was two and a half , she was still pouring out the whole pan of books whenever she wanted to hear a story . I knew this was an effective storage method . For years it had served me faithfully and weathered the abuse of four boys who , collectively , had been a whirling dervish of activity . Why , oh why , was it not working for our quiet little girl ? Finally it occurred to me that she had never been taught the system . So , I spent about two minutes showing her how to browse through the entire collection without having to dump it . End of problem . What may seem obvious to you may not be quite as clear to one of your children . Explain how things are done and why they 're done in a particular fashion . Too bad children are n't born with a guarantee that says , " This child will self-maintain in five years . He will make his bed , pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a matching pair of socks in the clothes hamper . " Imagine the reduction in your work load if every person were to selfmaintain . Ahhhhhhh . Perhaps this beatific state will never quite materialize , but you can certainly nourish the dream by incorporating systems that are easy for the child to implement . Here are some ideas : 1 . Shoes will be put away if they can be thrown into a large open container . I 've never seen a kid yet who 'll file his // shoes into a shoe file , tuck them into a shoe bag , or slide them onto shoe racks . But give him a large container ( cardboard box , kitty-litter pan , or industrial-sized dishpan ) and it works every time . Of course , in the dishpan the shoes are n't necessarily standing at attention in neatly matched pairs . But they are contained and confined , easy to put away and instantly located . 2 . Have in/out baskets for each child . When the children come home from school , they toss their books and papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or packages from Grandma , toss them into their in/out baskets . When you sign permission slips , report cards , or " please excuse " notes , put them into the respective containers . Homework is never lost and hunted for , the kitchen counter is kept clutter free , and self-maintenance is a snap . ( More on school papers in chapter 14 . ) Where to put these bins ? If you have n't a spare shelf in the kitchen , the lowest shelf in the linen closet works perfectly . These bins are so vital , any space you make to accommodate them is well worth it . 3 . Every child needs a junk drawer or some kind of container without a lid ? a kitty-litter pan , a restaurant-sized dishpan , a cardboard box . Here 's where the child tosses the license plate from the box of Honeycombs . The cardboard backing from the newest G.I. Joe . A gumball ring . A Pez dispenser . A 1984 Texas Folklife Festival pin . All are candidates for the junk container . ( If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's bed . And , most important , when containers are full , something must be tossed out in order to make room for new items. ) 4 . Children not only have junk " things " ? they also have junk paper . To a son , of course , the 1982 Chicago Bulls basketball schedule is not junk . Nor is that letter he wrote to James Bond or the note he got from his girlfriend . These valuable documents need a place , and the perfect container is a magazine file . This kind of file is usually made from heavy cardboard and is available at most large discount stores // and office-supply outlets . Or you can recycle a cereal or laundry detergent box and make your own . 5 . Take the sting out of the words " Clean up that room ! " by introducing the child to a quick clean-up technique . Here 's how it works : The next time one of your kids has to clean his room , give him a trash bag and a laundry basket . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay in the room until it 's clean , and the trash bag and laundry basket are to help him . All trash ? old school papers , dried-out food , wrappers , and so forth ? goes into the trash bag . Dirty laundry is put into the laundry basket . Next , anything that belongs in another room ( dirty dishes , sister 's doll , snowsuit , piano music , video tapes , and so forth ) are placed just outside the bedroom door in the hall . When everything is tidy , he dumps the trash , deposits the laundry , and puts away all the cast-offs waiting in the hallway . ( Once the laundry basket is emptied , he can use it as a tote box to help him deliver all those " put aways . " ) For young children , I 've found it 's a lot less frustrating to put the toys away once a day rather than to follow the kids around the house and continually tidy up after them . When toys are left lying in the family room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into a large basket , plastic wastebasket , or large drawstring bag . ( For safety reasons , large plastic trash bags are not recommended . ) Then , just before bed , have the children help you return each toy to its rightful location . Here are a few more ideas that simplify frequently delegated chores : ? Basic accessories such as a trash basket and clothes hamper in each bedroom encourage self-maintenance . ? Low-hanging closet rods and low shelves scale down a child 's room and make related tasks more manageable . // ? Use drawer dividers to separate socks , T-shirts , pajamas , and underwear . ? For small children , paste pictures on drawer dividers so they know what article goes where . To avoid morning madness , set out tomorrow 's clothes the night before . Hang matching outfits and accessories ( kept in a small drawstring bag ) on the same hanger . School-aged children should each have an alarm clock and be responsible for getting themselves out of bed . ( Some children who are difficult to rouse may require two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That way you wo n't end up wasting a lot of your morning cajoling a child out of bed . I suppose the most commonly delegated chore is dishes . Here again , make it easy . Jobs like setting and clearing the table or loading and unloading the dishwasher are simplified when dishes , flatware , and glasses are toted back and forth in a dishpan . Once the simplified systems are executed , work with the kids . As they become older and more competent , you can begin to withdraw from some of your responsibilities . For example , I work with the children in the kitchen just long enough for them to know what to do and where to put things . For the first little while they 'll say , " Where does this casserole dish go ? What about the cake pan and the colander ? How do you load the dishwasher ? " Remember , even working with the kids is faster than doing the entire job yourself and further nourishes the cooperative attitude . In a nutshell , here 's a rundown : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children mentally prepared . ? Explain why things are done a certain way . ? Set up simple organizational systems . ? Work with the children and teach them what to do . // Nevertheless , beware . Children are masters at upward delegation ? trying to get you to take the job back . Pay attention to the creative ways your children do it ; by ignoring their attempts , you 'll stop the game . Our nine-year-old gripes . Boy , does he gripe . With the drama of a soap-opera heroine he feigns illness . As if auditioning for a remake of Roots , he moans , " Why do I have to do all the work around here ? " Bondage and slavery are his bywords . If this kid does n't make it as a professional complainer , the Grand Canyon will never make it as a professional hole ! Schuyler 's method is somewhat subtle . Curling her lower lip and blinking back tears , she laments , " I hate housework . " Our oldest teenager , who at this writing is seventeen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the years since his birth , I 've fielded more questions than Ann Landers . Get this : A week ago he said ? and I promise this is true ? " Mom , how do you make a bed ? " He figures that if he asks enough questions and interrupts me often enough , I 'll decide it 's easier to do it myself or come to his rescue and be relieved of the cross-examination . I 'll admit it , his method worked for quite a while until I got wise to his tactics . Now , I just say , " I 'm sure you 'll figure it out . " Stop feeling sorry for the " poor little things . " Generally speaking , any behavior resembling that of a Libyan leader , a three-year-old child , and a professional tennis star is usually just a cleverly disguised attempt at upward delegation . Express your heartfelt confidence in the child 's ability and leave him to his work . Once in a while plaintive cries are signals that the child has not been trained properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not made his bed several times before , his bed-making question would have been acceptable . So , determine the cause of the kids ' protests . If they 've been trained and you 've seen them succeed at the job , you may well assume the problem is upward delegation . If not , // perhaps more training is required . Kids and organization are not , contrary to popular belief , mutually exclusive . But to happily marry the two does take some work on your part . No matter what else you do , appreciate their efforts . My husband does a lot of dishes and almost always puts them away in the wrong places . So what ? It takes me one or two minutes to straighten things out . But without his help I 'd be spending thirty or forty-five minutes in the kitchen . Be grateful for anything anyone does to help , because every minute the other person invests is a minute you save . Perhaps relying on family members alone is not the whole answer . No , I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze a few extra hours into your day . You 're probably sacrificing sleep already . And , no , you do n't have to accept a lower standard of household upkeep . Another solution is to delegate the most annoying and time-consuming chores by hiring outside help . Here 's a list of duties to consider hiring out : housework , yard work , laundry and ironing , mending and sewing , grocery shopping , cooking , pet care , chauffeuring and errand running , window washing , car maintenance , plant care , house repairs , bookkeeping . Who 's available for these types of jobs ? Students , homemakers , retired people , and , of course , professional housekeepers and cleaning services . Students , homemakers , and retirees usually have more flexible schedules , are willing to work short-hour jobs , and generally charge less per hour than the professionals . The professionals , however , are usually bonded and insured . To locate a qualified candidate check the following sources : 1 . Schools . Call the guidance counselors at your local junior and senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are seeking work . The counselor is also aware of the students ' work habits , personality traits , and dependability , all of which are of interest to you as an employer . 2 . Senior citizen centers . If there is a center in your area , call to see if they offer referral services for retirees . Other // places to check are libraries and community centers. 3 . Friends . Talk to your friends and co-workers . Do they know someone who does the kind of work you 're requiring ? One of my friends is a housekeeper who has never had to advertise . She started working for one woman and before long had more business than she alone could handle . Word of mouth is a good source of reliable help . 4 . Community . Local newspapers are an obvious source of help either by searching the situations-wanted section in the want ads or placing an ad yourself . Other community sources are bulletin boards found in some supermarkets , laundromats , photocopy outlets , and student union buildings on college campuses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick rundown on professionals in your area . Interview all potential candidates and make special note of each one 's appearance , personality , and suitability for the particular job . Be sure to check references from previous employers , and always talk to at least one character reference ( neighbor , religious leader , a close friend , or out-ofstate family member ) . When you 've singled out the right helper , strike an agreement . Determine how often and how long he or she will work in a week . Whenever possible , set specific starting and stopping hours . Salary and salary reviews should also be discussed and agreed upon . Consider , too , how sick days will be handled . Above all , though , be sure there is a clear-cut job description so both parties will know what to expect . Now you have the principles of delegating firmly within your grasp . Persist and be patient , for the rewards are many . Delegating is like a stone thrown into a pool . Just as the ripples spread out in ever-widening circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life . You 'll make time for yourself and your family , which in turn will create a harmonious lifestyle and bring the balance back into your life . Delegate and make time for the good times . It 's time well spent . 7 A Stitch in Time Make Every Moment Count Once upon a time there was a mayonnaise manufacturer with a problem . He was producing large quantities of mayonnaise , which use a lot of egg yolks ; but the more mayonnaise he produced , the more egg whites he had left over . Day after day he watched helplessly as his workers discarded hundreds of pounds of egg whites . Finally he turned the problem over to one of his chemists and asked him if he could figure out a resourceful way to use all those egg whites . After some time the chemist returned with a fine by-product that did indeed use a lot of egg whites . He invented marshmallows ? and now you know the rest of the story . This wise manufacturer was n't satisfied with leaving well enough alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 68 // leftovers . He wanted to squeeze a measure of value out of everything he possibly could . Often the success of an industry depends upon its ability to develop and use by-products . Even movies and TV shows have spin-offs that result in new programs . Meat packers use every portion of an animal for some useful purpose ? the hooves for glue and the hair for strong rope , and so forth . And where would we be without the by-products of the oil industry ? Imagine not having gasoline or plastic . The little minutes of our lives , the odd moments , are the by-products of our time . And our success also depends upon our ability to use them . Those who are most successful in life are usually those who wisely use odd moments . I became a moment manager very modestly at first by always carrying some handwork with me whenever I left the house . Before long I had crocheted doilies to put under baskets , plants , and figurines . Almost miraculously badges were sewn ( rather than stapled ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special message to a friend . But the real payoff was Schuyler 's Christmas dress . I finished it before Christmas ! It was a long crocheted dress covered with ruffles . The skirt alone was fifty-five inches around and thirty-six inches long . Six weeks before Christmas I decided it would be impossible to finish that dress , but with my newfound resolve to use up every odd moment , and with the determination of a trash compactor , I did it . Of course , I was terribly proud of myself and began to brag just a little by telling everyone how much could be accomplished in a minute here and there . I soon discovered , as braggarts do , that I was only an amateur . There are a lot of pros who do very little talking about their efforts . Instead , they parlay every extra second into something productive and worthwhile . For example , the president of a major university reads while waiting for a stoplight to turn green . A mother of eleven children teaches her daughters to knit at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's waiting for // something to happen . One woman keeps a copy of the Bible in her laundry room and during the course of a few years she reads the entire book while she 's waiting for the spin cycle to finish . I met another pro at a meeting I had spoken at . She approached me cautiously , not realizing that she was addressing an amateur , for it was she who taught me . " For years , " she confessed , " magazines piled up around the house unread . I just could n't find enough time to sit down and read them . " So this clever minute manager put the magazines in the bathroom and read them cover to cover every single month by reading one article , one poem , one story at a time . Another miracle of the odd moment . Then there 's my friend Sherrill Anderson . She 's a working wife and mother who still makes time for personal development . During lunch hours and coffee breaks , you 'll often find Sherrill tackling some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicrafts . When she 's talking on the phone or waiting in the dentist 's office , you can bet she 's doing something . One particularly complicated and beautiful cross-stitch sampler graces her home . She worked on it during pack meetings . And with three boys , she goes to plenty of those . Sherrill 's home is filled with her handiwork . So are the homes of her friends . Handmade Christmas gifts and birthday remembrances , messages of encouragement , and cheering phone calls are all a part of her life , made possible by the odd moment . In five short months , again using up the odd moments , she painted all the doors , woodwork , crown moldings , and baseboards in her home ( which required removing and relaying carpet , a job she also did by herself ) ; repapered her bathroom , bedroom , entry way , and stairway ; upholstered the headboard of her bed and made matching throw pillows ; converted a front hall closet into a pantry ; cleaned out her basement ; and organized a neighborhood garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too tired to mention . One // " Good morning ! " from Sherrill and I have the sudden urge to dust the water softener , tailor a suit , and finish the Christmas shopping by the Fourth of July ! Everyone should have such an invigorating friendship . Yes , these are the pros , the real achievers , and my passing along time-management advice was like pointing out middle C to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . I was an Oscar Madison in a world filled with Felix Ungers . But at least I was on the right track . As I studied and watched these master minute managers I noticed a common denominator . They anticipate events . Anticipatory planning not only gives them extra chunks of free time , it also helps them absorb every odd moment with productive activity . Now , I am not suggesting that every minute of your day be saturated with productive activity . I use odd moments for fun . I crochet , pore over cookbooks , knit , read , eat , and so on . And sometimes I use odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have a block of free time later on . The first thing I learned to anticipate was waiting time . Have you ever noticed how much of your day is spent waiting for something to happen ? You wait for the water to boil , wait for an appointment , wait for the bus , wait in line at the grocery store , wait for the kids at school , practices , and lessons . Each one of us spends a lot of time waiting every single day . And it often happens unexpectedly . I was scheduled to attend a meeting that was being held at a local library . The meeting started at 9:00 A.M. , so I arrived at 8:40 A.M. to register and get settled in . Imagine my surprise when the librarians refused to unlock the doors before nine o'clock . Why did n't I bring something to do ? It was my turn to carpool the basketball team after practice . I pulled up behind the gym at 5:00 P.M. , the time the boys were always finished . But for some reason they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't I bring something to do ? // I made a doctor 's appointment and intentionally scheduled the first appointment time of the day so I would n't have to wait . Guess what ? I know , I should have known better ? someone had a baby and you know who had to deliver it . Why did n't I bring something to do ? Yes , I 've learned through experience to always carry something with me that will occupy my time should I find myself waiting . And I bring it even when I 'm positive I wo n't have to wait . First , I always have my planning notebook with me . That gives me a book to both read and write in . Inside my book are thought-provoking messages to read and enjoy . A list of words and their meanings are ready for review . With my planning notebook I can plan tomorrow , re-read a goal , work out menus and prepare a shopping list , or record a journal entry . There 's lots to do when you have a planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting bag when I 'm commuting on public transportation or going somewhere in the car . What 's a waiting bag ? It holds anything you want it to , but here 's what I keep in mine . My waiting bag is a red gym bag that holds a craft project I 'm working on . Everything from an afghan to a penguin has been toted around in that carry-all . I keep all the needed supplies for the project , including directions , right in the satchel . A small cosmetic bag holds crochet hooks , scissors , tape measure , stitch holders and markers , and a variety of needles . I use the waiting bag at home too . I carry it into the family room so I can sit down and work on my project while I watch TV . Everything is self-contained , and I never have to run around searching for materials . What if you 're not crafty ? The waiting bag can hold mending , books , office work , reading that has to be done for your job ( trade journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letter-writing supplies , cassette recorder and tapes ( these can also be used for dictation ) , paperwork , // a warm-up suit , and running shoes . Virtually any portable task is a nominee for the waiting bag . Another defense weapon is my car organizer . I use a Tupperware personal valet container because it 's compact yet roomy , shuts tightly , and slips easily under the front seat of the car . Inside the organizer I keep a few pieces of stationery , some envelopes , stamps , Band-Aids , wet wiping cloths , purse-size package of facial tissue , scissors , pens , a mending kit , loose change , glue , tape , stapler and staples , a paper punch , paper clips , and a memo pad . A few minutes spent putting this kit together has saved me hours of time and prevented many needless frustrations . Being prepared is the answer to most of life 's crises ! Another thing I carry is my " handbag office . " This is a very small , zippered cosmetic bag I keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a miniature paper punch ( so I can punch floating pieces of paper and include them in my planning notebook ) , tiny ( and I mean tiny ) stapler and staples , small scissors , rubber bands , tape measure , Post-It notes , and paper clips . This purse office is approximately 4 x 5 inches ( just slightly larger than an index card ) and is about threefourths of an inch thick . It 's very small but extremely useful . Now I find myself planning waiting time . I try to be early for meetings and appointments . That way I have a few minutes of uninterrupted time to work on the project in my waiting bag . I 've found , though , that ( weather permitting ) the best place to wait is in the car . It 's quiet and you wo n't be interrupted . There 's no one to talk to and nothing to keep you from your chosen task . ( Of course , if it 's a doctor 's appointment you do n't want to wait in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put your name on the waiting list ? now ! ) The media tours I do for Procter and Gamble give me many opportunities to wait . Flying from city to city and // waiting to board planes gives me countless hours of uninterrupted time . Waiting in TV studios for a scheduled appearance and filling lonely hours in a hotel room , I chalk up still more time . One particular trip I decided I 'd knit a winter coat for Schuyler , so I packed up my waiting bag and carried it with me on the plane . At the city of my destination I met my publicist , who gave me a quick rundown of our week 's activities and then whisked me off to our hotel . Determined to have the coat finished by the end of the week , I was knitting as we drove . " I used to love to knit , " Sally sighed . " I had a sweater started , but I gave it up . I just do n't have time to knit anymore . " For four full days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radio stations , in airports , in hotel rooms , and 35,000 feet in the air as we flew from one city to another . Sally read , slept , ate , and talked ? yet she did n't have time to knit . Of course she had time . She had just chosen other activities . However , if you sincerely wish you had time for a oncebeloved hobby , start anticipating waiting time and use it . It 's amazing how much you can accomplish even when you have to chip away at something . ( Yes , I finished the coat . ) Once you 've mastered waiting time , look for other ways anticipatory planning can help you whittle away unnecessary demands on your time budget and your nerves . My family is not too great at planning ahead , so I check with everyone the night before and ask them what their plans are for tomorrow . I 'm mainly interested in any event that directly concerns me and affects my time . For example , Jim might say , " I 'm playing racketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim as I do , at 5:15 he 's going to ask me if his trunks are clean . And , " Do you know where I put my racket ? Where 's my gym bag ? Did Brian use my glove when he was playing baseball ? " So , I get everything situated now instead of waiting for the inevitable upheaval at 5:15 tomorrow evening . // " Oh , yeah , Mom . I was late for school yesterday and you need to write a note . " I do it now instead of waiting for tomorrow 's rush hour . " I 'm staying after school to watch a volleyball game . Can you come and get me ? " I schedule it now , or make other arrangements for the child to get home . This is a good time to review what dates , deadlines , and appointments you have scheduled for tomorrow . Now is the time to scan the kids ' planning sheets to see if you 've overlooked something . Do you see how anticipatory planning eliminates a lot of unnecessary interruptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time now so you wo n't have to be interrupted later on . You can schedule your day 's activities around these other responsibilities . What else can you anticipate ? Will your children be invited to birthday parties in upcoming months ? Do you always buy gifts for specific friends or loved ones ? Do you send greeting cards ? If you know that you 're going to need things such as gifts and cards , why do you waste time making special trips to the store whenever a special event comes up ? Anticipate these events . Shop sales and stockpile gifts and cards to have on hand . Frequently people use money as an excuse for procrastinating . If you do n't have the money now , the only reason you 'll have it later is because it 's urgent . ( " Mom 's birthday is tomorrow . I have to buy her gift today . " ) Also , if you find good sales , sometimes several gifts add up to less money than one gift would cost at the regular price . A few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel kits that were being discontinued . I knew they 'd make wonderful gifts so I checked the price . They were marked down , incredibly , to $1.00 , so I bought five of them and stored them in a gift box at home . Another time I found an irresistible music box marked down from $14.00 to $1.98 . ( Yes , it worked and was in mint condition . ) I found some full-color , large picture books for children , regularly // $6.95 , that were marked down to $1.50 . I bought four for birthday gifts and spent less than had I bought one at the regular price . You see , " I do n't have enough money , " is not always a valid excuse . Once you have a gift supply at home to draw from , save a little money now and then so you 'll have a small cash reserve when these wonderful sales come along . Saving money , I suppose , is reason enough to anticipate buying gifts , but just wait until you see how much time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll always be prepared . Time management is truly the most effective weapon in your battle against stress . What else can you anticipate ? Think of anything that comes up on a regular basis ? car inspections , spelling tests every Friday , bills to pay , Christmas , income taxes , planting the garden , Sunday dinner . All can be planned for and executed flawlessly without tension or trauma . Have you ever noticed how we gasp in horror when we read that someone has thrown away his whole life through a single act of suicide ? Yet we each throw our lives away a minute here , a minute there , and we think nothing of it . Please commit the following statements to memory , then raise your right hand and promise to remember them always : 1 . Self-discipline comes through anticipatory planning , not when the time of decision arrives . 2 . No one has enough time to use only ideal moments . 3 . Do n't let an imperfect situation be an excuse to do nothing . Anticipate and liberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now For today 's test , please complete the following sentence : As salt is to pepper , as ham is to egg , as bread is to butter , procrastination is to : ( a ) chewed fingernails , ( b ) conniption fits , ( c ) medical calamities , such as high blood pressure , stroke , upset stomach , nervous prostration , headache , or depression , ( d ) botchery , ( e ) all of the above , but especially medical calamities and botchery . If you did n't pick E , you are hereby banned for life from watching anything on TV except fly fishing . Shame on you . Do n't you know how harmful procrastination is to your wellbeing ? Rumor has it that the surgeon general has taken the procrastination problem under advisement and is expected to issue a warning soon . 77 // I confess . Many years ago , I would have chosen ( a ) chewed fingernails too . In those days I was only mildly aware of the price I was paying for my procrastination . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting things off that I 've come to realize that procrastination is a deadly time , energy , and money ( yes , money ) destroyer . I suffer from a disease similar to alcoholism in that there is no cure except admitting your addiction and abstinence . I am , gulp , an " as soon as-er . " As soon as Schuyler gets into high school , I 'll clean the basement and catch up the baby books . As soon as I do the dishes , make the beds , vacuum , and clean the bathroom , I 'll start my daily planning session . As soon as I take a nap , I 'll get up and exercise . As soon as I can afford it , I 'll take piano lessons again . I 've wasted a lot of todays waiting for the perfect tomorrow . And so it goes . Along with todays , a lot of cold , hard cash is also wasted . In Utah we are required to have our cars undergo a yearly safety inspection . Well , one year we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadline , so we decided to press our luck for a day or two . Just as we began to press , we were , of course , stopped by a friendly police officer . Listening to the lecture and waiting while he wrote the ticket took about twenty minutes . Then we had approximately ten days to drive out to city hall and pay the fine . ( Add another hour and subtract thirty dollars . ) And you know what ? We still had to get the car inspected . Did we save any time procrastinating ? No . The very act of putting off the job added an additional one hour and twenty minutes and cost us an extra thirty dollars . The thirty dollars , by the way , reflects only the cost of the fine and not the loss in wages that occurred when we took off work to take care of that little matter . A woman attending one of my classes related this costly account : " My husband rented a hydraulic jack and kept putting off returning it to the rental agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency finally called and said they needed to receive a payment and the jack ? unless my husband wanted to continue renting it . He returned the // jack and tried to beg off the rental fee by saying he had n't been using the jack and that he had simply forgotten to return it . The upshot of the story is that ultimately the man was sued by the rental agency and not only had to pay the bill but also hire an attorney and miss work to go to court . The total cost of his procrastination ? Approximately thirty-five hundred dollars and fifteen hours of his time . Let 's face it . None of us has the time or the money to procrastinate . For the most part , I 've kicked the habit , and perhaps this would be a nice time to share with you the ten best antiprocrastination measures you can take . 1 . Know how you procrastinate . You must recognize the early warning signals and take action before your procrastination ploys take over . One morning I went to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day 's list . Boy , what a list . I had several major projects ? rewrite a brochure , write a newsletter , organize a mailing list of about two thousand names , to list just a few of the tasks . Also , there were some lowpriority phone calls I could make if I had time later in the day . I said to myself , " Let 's get these phone calls out of the way ; then I can concentrate on the big stuff . " In other words , " As soon as I make these calls , then I 'll get busy . " Since I admitted my " as soon as " addiction , I am now trained to catch myself every time I utter those words . Then I think objectively about what I 'm considering . To say , " As soon as I finish this manuscript , I 'll begin accepting speaking engagements , " is justifiable . However , to say , " As soon as I think up clever titles for every chapter in my new book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procrastination . Do you see the difference ? Besides " as soon as , " some other typical delay tactics are hunger , fatigue , fiddling with low-priority papers , straightening things up , catching up on nonessential jobs , primping , taking breaks , opening mail , and phone calls . ( " Oh , hi ! Carol ? Let 's make a date for tennis . How does Friday sound ? " ) // Why do we do it ? I wanted to make those low-priority phone calls because they would take little physical effort and I would n't have to exert much brainpower . Plus , in just a few minutes I would have had five things crossed off my list . Wow ! Rewriting the brochure , however , would be a grueling process , and what if I messed it up ? It was an important job , and failure was a possibility . So I was weighing a guaranteed , easy success against hard work and a chance at failure . I really had to struggle with myself , but I did n't make those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hard that was ? turning on the word processor and not reaching for the phone . ) Another reason we putter around with the low pay-off jobs is that they give us instant rewards . With big jobs you do n't get that feeling of " Hey ! I did it ! I 'm done ! " for days or even weeks , depending on the size of the chore . Small , nocount tasks are here today , gone today , and quickly checked off , and we fool ourselves into thinking that busy-ness and productivity mean the same thing . Let 's face it . We like to act on routine tasks just because they are easy , but they keep us from getting onto the more important things . Routine is , admittedly , comfortable and seems essential , whereas more important projects are frequently more difficult , unfamiliar , and consequently intimidating . Just as the cure of a disease is facilitated if caught in the early stages of its progression , knowing how you procrastinate gives you a headstart on solving the problem . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with half-knitted sweaters , unopened embroidery kits , and yards of fabric purchased with good intentions ? Do you have large files of things to be filed ? Is the to-do list you made on Monday still good on Friday ? In other words , do you have a hard time getting a project started , and procrastinate at the beginning of a job ? Or do you lose steam halfway through and stack up unfinished projects like cannons in a courtyard ? // Determine when you procrastinate and , using some of the following ideas , work around your critical point by reinforcing your efforts when you need it most . 3 . Use a planning notebook every day . Refer to goals you 've set , dates , deadlines , appointments , and the running to-do list . ( While you 're working on your daily list , do n't forget to anticipate . ) Simplifying your record keeping will discourage procrastination , and the best way to streamline the process is to use only one calendar . Have you ever been in a group of people and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens when two or three people respond ? That 's right . Everyone has a slightly different answer . " It 's 8:10 . " " Oh , my watch says 8:13 . " The same holds true for calendars : if you have more than one , you never know which one is accurate and up to date . Also , you 're constantly overlapping your efforts , creating more work and more problems for yourself . A family calendar is fine as long as you promise on your word of honor to faithfully coordinate it with your planning notebook . 4 . Break down big jobs . If it 's a big job you 're putting off , break it down into a bunch of little tasks . Preferably , each small job should take less than forty-five minutes . Remember the five afghans I told you I want to make just as soon as I finish this book ? That 's a big job , but here 's how I broke it up : ? Decide what color to make Jeff 's afghan . ? Go to yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Start working . Each of those tasks will take less than forty-five minutes and would be very manageable . Notice that I 'm working on one at a time . Just think how much more complicated it would be to choose colors and patterns for all five at the same time . Here 's how I broke down rewriting the brochure : // ? Outline key points in current brochure . ? Delete obsolete material . ? List additional points to include . ? Draw up new , proposed outline . ? Show skeleton draft to boss . ? Rewrite brochure , one section at a time . If you decided after reading number 2 ( deciding when you procrastinate ) that you put off starting projects , this breaking-down idea is one of the reinforcements you need to use . Citing the afghan example again , you may argue that breaking up the job as I suggested will involve going to the store for yarn and a pattern five times instead of just doing it once . But for a person who ca n't get started , choosing five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overheat like a $99 Impala , and the task is postponed forever . Simplify the job and you 'll start sooner . 5 . Reward yourself . ( This one is perfect for nonfinishers . ) What do you have to look forward to when the job is done ? What 's in it for you ? If you have n't done so already , start making that reward list . Will you go to lunch with a friend , take the kids to a drive-in , buy a new suit , or go on a cruise ? Whatever reward you choose , make it exciting and attainable. 6 . Involve other people . ( Another good one for nonfinishers . ) Tell someone what you plan to do and when you plan to have it completed . ( The more people you tell , the better . ) Have someone monitor your progress so you 'll stay on target . Once you have committed your plans to another person , you not only have your own intrinsic motivation to draw from , but an extrinsic source as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have that outside power source as a back-up reservoir . It sort of works like a hand on your back , gently pushing you along . // I had a woman in one of my classes who just could n't wait to set up her planning notebook . Filled with enthusiasm , she went straight home and got started . With a raised eyebrow and deprecating laugh , her husband chided her : " Well , here we go again . You 've had more highs and lows than the national weather service . How long do you think this program is going to last ? " Instead of exploding in a rage of anger , this woman said , " Okay , you 're on . In seven days I want you to ask me how I 'm doing with my new system and ask me how many things I 've forgotten to do . I 'll prove I can do it . " In seven days the man checked back with his wife , and to his surprise , she was still reporting success . " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get whenever you go to a lecture , " he said . " Let 's see how it 's going in a month or two . " Well , that 's all our friend needed to hear . The challenge worked , and to this day she carries her planning notebook much as a child packs her Cabbage Patch Kid . Get others involved . It works . I 've already involved you in one of my projects , and you 're probably not even aware of it . But someday I may meet you , and you 're going to ask me if I ever finished those five afghans . Just knowing I 'm going to have to face you someday is what 's going to keep me crocheting when I 'm halfway through the third one and ready to quit . 7 . Use up odd moments of time . Continually ask yourself if there is even a small portion of a job you can do now . 8 . Ask , " How long is this really going to take ? " I used to procrastinate changing sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do each job in two minutes . What 's the big deal ? And what 's so hard about a twominute job ? Schuyler always asks me to read her a story at what seems to be the most inconvenient times . How long does it take to read a story ? Five minutes , tops . It 's nothing to get upset about . // Now , if you discover the job is , in fact , going to take a long time , then break it down until you can handle it . 9 . Hit the golf balls first . Remember the golf balls a few chapters back ? They represent the achievement-oriented tasks we should work on every day . Hit them first ! They 're usually the most difficult problems you have to deal with , and when you put those things on the back burner , they 'll be left for the part of the day when you 're the most tired and least motivated . Swing that club and handle the hard things first . That way your self-esteem skyrockets , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all downhill sledding. 10 . Just start . Sharpen your pencil , peek out from under the covers , dump one box of garbage in the basement , write the salutation , put on your running shoes . Do something now . One thing usually leads to another . Years ago we had a wonderful neighbor , George Merrill . He was the busiest and most organized man on the planet . He had an ordinary two-car garage that was always in such perfect order you could easily make a U-turn in it with your car . His wife , Carma , once told me that he could even find his socks in the dark and get the right color . I was impressed , but I must admit to a little skepticism . " Maybe he only has black socks , " I said to myself . So , curious as I am , I decided to pay more attention to George . Whenever he was outside working on his immaculately groomed yard , I would peek out the window and check out his socks . Brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . Finally I had had enough . " George , " I said , " how do you do it ? You are so busy . How do you stay so organized ? What 's your secret ? " I 'll always be grateful to George Merrill for sharing his secret with me . He said simply , " Do it . Do it right . Do it right now . " Then he added , " If you do n't have time to do it right , when will you have time to do it over ? " What words of wisdom ! Now , thanks to a thoughtful friend , I have " Do it ? Do it right ? Do it right now " done up in a cross-stitch sampler in my living room . It serves as a // constant reminder that I ( one who needs frequent jumpstarting ) must start and do something now . There you have it ? ten antidotes for procrastination . 1 . Know how you procrastinate. 2 . Determine when you procrastinate. 3 . Use a planning notebook every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reward yourself . 6 . Involve other people . 7 . Use up odd moments of time . 8 . Ask , " How long is this really going to take ? " 9 . Hit the golf balls first . 10 . Just start . That 's all well and good , but knowledge and intention are weak motivators . You must actually put these ideas into practice if you want to see success . Each of these ten points is a specific method to use when you need to get yourself motivated . Each of them works ! Remember , it is very difficult to change your mood by a sheer act of will . It is much easier to change your behavior ? but changing your behavior will , in turn , change your mood . Act yourself into feeling different . Do n't wait until your mood changes . Change your behavior now , and your mood will follow along . That 's why number 10 ? " Just start " ? is such an effective motivator . It changes your behavior . Here 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've stared at the word exercise on my daily to-do list and thought , " Oh , yuk ! I do n't want to exercise . I am too tired to exercise . I wo n't exercise . " Then I remember that my behavior can change my mood . " Okay , here 's the deal , " I say to myself . " Just put the aerobics tape in the VCR , turn it on , and watch it for a few minutes . If you still ca n't make yourself exercise , turn off the TV . " So I change my behavior and turn on the tape . That one simple act almost always changes my mood , and I 'm up and moving around . // Keep your mood in check in the first place by getting mentally prepared . Planning at night before bed , I mentally prepare for what 's coming up the next day . Driving to work , I think about how I 'm going to handle an irate customer . Sitting behind my desk about midafternoon , I start reminding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I get home . Mental preparedness is one way to keep a bad or lethargic mood from getting a stronghold on your behavior . What if you 're really unmotivated and for some reason you ca n't even take the first step ? And what if getting yourself mentally prepared does n't do the trick ? What then ? I 've had days like that , days when you look at the list of things you have to do and just ca n't seem to earn a check mark for even the simplest , most fundamental task . What do I do ? I flip to the running to-do list in my planning notebook and read the entire page . Then I ask myself if there is anything on that list I could talk myself into doing . Usually , there 's at least one job that sounds remotely interesting . ( Return Carol 's cake pan , order business cards , pick up a replacement bulb for the slide projector , find a good recipe for Shrimp Scampi , add pictures to the photo album . ) It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm doing something . Besides , I intended to do it sooner or later anyway . Try it yourself . After you 've finished that odd job , you 'll run head on into the best motivator of all ? success ! You finished something ! You did it ! Maybe now you can face that to-do list . 9 Interrupting the Interruption Cycle How to Control Interruptions Pose this question to one thousand women and they 'll each give you the same answer : " What is your biggest time waster ? " Procrastination ? No . Lack of self-discipline ? No . Unrealistic time estimates ? No . Unhesitatingly , they 'd pick interruptions , hands ? or should I say thumbs ? down ! Various studies have shown that managers are interrupted approximately every eight minutes . As a mom , I 'd say the same holds true at home too , although that estimate may be a little conservative . " I want a drink of water . " " Please comb Barbie and Skipper 's hair . " " Where 's my other shoe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the stairs . Walk the dog . Answer the doorbell . Tote that barge , lift that bale . Yes , interruptions are the bane of motherhood . 87 // But be advised : Interruptions are not created equal . There are two types of interruptions , those that are necessary and those that are unnecessary . 1 . Necessary interruptions . Yes , some interruptions are necessary . For example , if your children never interrupted you , they could die . " Mom , the baby is in the street . " " Excuse , me , Mother , but the house is on fire . " " Oh , Mom , there 's a rattlesnake in the backyard . " I repeat , some interruptions are necessary . Still others , while not life threatening , are also necessary . The end of the wash cycle signals it 's time to put the clothes into the dryer . Your boss delegates a " stop all the presses , here 's a high priority job that must be done now " project . The school calls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend is going through a crisis and she calls to say , " I need you . Can you come over ? " Just realizing that many interruptions are important and necessary should help you to cope with their dogged demands . However , there are others , which leads me to 2 . Unnecessary interruptions . Any interruption you could have planned for or prevented is an unnecessary interruption . These are the hidden destroyers , so to speak , because they 're often masked by seeming urgencies and sometimes appear necessary . Imagine that it 's ten below zero outside and the winds are howling , and your son asks where his gloves are . Now , that may seem like a necessary interruption because , due to the weather conditions , he desperately needs to wear his gloves to school . But think again . If the gloves had a specific place where they belonged and had been put back in that spot , you would not have been interrupted . Here 's another scenario . The brakes go out in the car and it 's simply unsafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed today . Necessary or unnecessary ? Unnecessary . Yes , the brakes must be fixed , but usually you can sense when the brakes are on their way out days before they grind down to their last screeching halt . The brake job could // have been planned for another day . It was simply procrastination that caused today 's interruption . It 's Saturday morning and you 're anxious to tackle several projects you 've been waiting to get to all week . About halfway through cleaning the closets , your husband announces ( with the enthusiasm and excitement of a man whose team has just won the Super Bowl ) , " Come outside and help me . I decided today would be a great day to sod the front yard . They 're delivering the grass right now ! " Necessary or unnecessary ? Unnecessary . Now , hear me out . I 'm not advocating divorce court . First , something as major as sodding the front yard should have been planned in advance ( although in this case , you were n't included in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminates untimely interruptions : Suppose on Friday night you tell your husband ( or any other time offender ) what you are planning to do on Saturday . Tell him you 've been meaning to get these projects out of the way for a long time . " Can you think of anything that will keep me from my schedule ? " If he says , " Yes . I wanted to sod the front yard tomorrow , " you can negotiate a compromise or offer to fix lunch for his friends who could come to help him . If he says , " No , " then you 're off and running . Here 's my typical approach : " Jim , this is what I 've planned to do next Saturday . If you have something scheduled that needs my attention , will you let me know today ? " One of the biggest problems couples have is communicating . You fill your own head with ideas , dreams , and plans ? and he does the same . Then you wake up one morning and decide this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does the same . And guess what ? Pretty soon somebody 's plans start to look more like a hubcap spinning for the gutter . So think , plan , and dream out loud . The other person in your life can not read your mind . Anticipate and communicate to eliminate unnecessary interruptions and dashed hopes . // Anticipate interruptions from the kids , too . I can set my watch by Schuyler 's schedule . Every weekday morning at 10:30 A.M. sharp she comes to me with slumped shoulders and sighs , " It 's abysmal time " ? meaning there 's nothing good to watch on TV . Knowing this interruption is coming , I can plan something and prepare for it : invite a friend to come over , read to her , or suggest other activities for her to do . Generally , I just take her interruptions in stride . But once in a while I desperately need to have a span of time when I 'm not interrupted , like when I 'm putting the final touches on a dinner party , doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It " certificates for every child in the elementary school , or wallpapering the bathroom . When I genuinely need some whole-hearted cooperation , I reach into my bag of tricks ? which is also handy when someone 's stuck in bed with the flu ( and bored to death ) , or when we 're waiting for an hour in the doctor 's office . So , what 's in that magical bag ? Here 's a peek. 1 . We subscribe to a few children 's magazines . Before the children have a chance to read them , I photocopy some of the activity pages ( such as mazes , " what 's wrong with this picture , " word searches , " find 14 things that begin with the letter B , " and hidden pictures ) and keep them stockpiled in a file folder . The kids enjoy the magazines and use the activity pages , but months ( sometimes years ) later when I need to keep them busy , I pull out an activity page from the file and it 's as effective and fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . To make a bubble-blowing solution , use 1 quart of water and 1/4 cup of Joy dishwashing liquid . ( That particular brand works best , for some reason . ) Straws and funnels make good bubble blowers. 3 . Here 's my favorite play dough recipe : Combine 1 cup flour , 1 cup water , 1/2 cup salt , 2 tablespoons oil , and 2 teaspoons cream of tartar . Add a few drops of food coloring , if desired . Cook mixture over low heat until it forms a ball in the middle of the pan . Drop ball of dough onto a // breadboard and knead until cooled . Store dough in tightly covered container or plastic bag . 4 . Older children might enjoy sculpting and painting their creations . Here 's a recipe for a dough that hardens and can be painted : Mix together 4 cups flour , 1 cup salt , and 11/2 cups water ; knead until smooth . Sculpt and mold as desired . Bake sculpted items at 350 degrees for about an hour , or until slightly browned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Present the child with a small box containing some old magazines or catalogs , some scissors , construction paper , and a glue stick ( or muselage glue with a rubber-tipped applicator , or a plastic tube of roll-on water glue ) . If you 're not afraid of a mess , toss in a small container of glitter . 6 . Schuyler entertains herself for hours on end playing dress-up and making up her face with cornstarch powder and lip gloss . 7 . If you have n't any glamorous cast-offs the kids can use as dress-up clothes , a secondhand store is the place to stock up . An evening gown , jewelry , even fake furs , can be purchased for very little money . ( I spent half my childhood playing Miss America. ) 8 . Our boys have kept themselves busy with a block of wood , a hammer , and a box of nails . Or we can give them a screwdriver and let them disassemble a broken stereo , clock , electronic game , or tape recorder . We wo n't hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( One of our children even built a battery-operated robot out of a cardboard box and some old electrical parts. ) 9 . Styrofoam packing forms are also fun for the kids to play with . They use them as army forts ( G.I. Joe headquarters ) or Barbie apartments , and they cut them into chunks to make furniture or other creations . 10 . Save small boxes and scraps of fabric so the kids can make doll furniture and clothes . The boys , of course , will use the fabric as bandages when G.I. Joe gets injured in the // line of duty ? and if Joe does n't pull through , the fabric will be there to turn him into a mummy . 11 . Save the hundreds of magazines stickers you get in the mail and pull them out for a child to lick and stick on a piece of paper . 12 . Save the trinkets that come in cereal boxes and use them as new toys when you need to keep a child occupied . 13 . Buy four or five storybooks and record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signal to turn the page . Using the alias " Ding Dong Mama , " I 've relied on this one a lot , and our kids play the tapes until they wear out . 14 . Let the kids make jewelry using string ( shoelaces , or shoestring licorice ) , 0-shaped cereal , cut-up straws , and macaroni . 15 . A bowl of marshmallows , gumdrops , and jelly beans and a box of round toothpicks keep the children busy building creations they can eat . 16 . Paste a coloring-book picture on a small piece of poster board and , using a paper punch , punch holes around the perimeter . The child then colors the picture and " frames " it by sewing through the holes with a length of colorful yarn . 17 . Teach the children how to make a wax picture . Color a design on a piece of paper using any color but black . Be sure the entire sheet of paper is covered with color . Then color with black crayon over the entire design . Next , using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scratch a design in the black crayon to expose the bright colors beneath . 18 . Rent a video , or present the child with a few new puzzles , a sticker book , or paper dolls . Anything new usually holds a child 's attention ? at least for a while . And that 's all you want , a little time for yourself , time that 's uninterrupted . Satisfied needs are not motivators , so these activities should be used infrequently enough that they retain their allure . For example , our children have a large covered container of cracked wheat ( cornmeal also works well ) that I let them // play with . They dump the wheat into a few large cake pans and use them as miniature sandboxes . ( Sure , it 's a little messy , but it 's clean and easy to sweep up . ) I let the kids play with wheat only about once every three months or so ; used only that occasionally , it 's always an attention grabber and keeps them entertained for quite a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Here 's what I mean : If you know you 're going to be preoccupied with a project for the next little while , satisfy the kids ' hunger for your attention before you get started . Read a few stories to them , set out a few snacks for them to help themselves , play a game , sing , or work on a simple art project together . Satisfied in this way , they wo n't feel so neglected when you get busy . Yes , the kids are going to interrupt you , but if you fill them up first or have some diversion activities ready , you 'll not only eliminate a bunch of interruptions , but both you and the kids will also be a lot happier . Now for the humdinger . There is yet another type of unnecessary interruption , and a conquest of this is comparable to David defeating Goliath . These are interruptions you seek out . Whenever I 'm doing something difficult ( like writing this book ) , or unpleasant ( like washing the windows ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I do n't want to be interrupted ? but in my heart I 'm suffering withdrawal symptoms . I need an interruption . If Jim says , " Come on and ride into town with me , " I 'm in the car with my seat belt fastened before he can even comb his hair or button his shirt . Or a friend will call on the phone and my alter ego Chatty Cathy takes over . And when my friend says , " I 'll let you go , I know you 're busy , " I counter with , " Me busy ? I 'm not doing a thing ! " Or I 'll get up and go into a co-worker 's office under the guise of needing to ask her a legitimate question . Of course , I 'm hoping the inquiry will grow into a full-blown conversation , the subject of which does n't matter in the slightest . // Determining self-induced interruptions requires painstaking self-honesty . These insidious interrupters may just be one of the methods you use to procrastinate an important task . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can catch yourself before the time has been needlessly wasted . Here 's the pep talk my head gives to my heart whenever I encounter those vulnerable moments : " You 're an easy target right now . You do n't really want to be doing this job , so beware . You may come up with a lot of creative ways to put it off . Be on guard . Watch for any sign of mutiny . " Lest you be too hard on yourself , it is perfectly acceptable to take a break now and then . I only offer this advice . Consider the part self-interruption plays in your life , and every time your will starts to flicker , ask yourself , " Do I really need a break , or am I just looking for a diversion ? " There is one other large cross section of women who , collectively , are extremely tough on themselves . They function as if they 're strapped to jetpacks soaring from one activity to another , yet they feel their efforts are in vain . They wonder what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the members of this indefatigable group ? They are women with young children . If this describes you , take heart . There 's a very good reason why you feel frustrated . Almost every interruption caused by a child under approximately three years of age is necessary ! So if you 're a mom with a young child , or two , or three , you must be a master at eliminating unnecessary interruptions from your life in order to get the most from your time . Constantly remind yourself that you 're doing everything humanly possible . Remember , this is motherhood . These interruptions are necessary . Besides , they wo n't last forever . It just seems like it . As a matter of fact , while I was writing the last one hundred words , my little daughter interrupted me three times . She was watching Captain Kangaroo and the color on the TV went out ( heaven forbid ) , so I had to fine-tune the television set . ( Necessary , sort of . ) Next , she had to make a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't find one of her favorite toys and needed me to help with the search-andrescue mission . ( Unnecessary . ) Guess which interruption kept me from working for the greatest length of time ? Of course , the unnecessary one . Had I followed my own rule to have things put back where they belong every day , Mr. Potato Head would not have been a missing person and no search posse would have been organized . Here 's a great technique to help you get a handle on your interruptions once and for all . About now , corporate timemanagement experts would recommend that you keep a time log and record every fifteen minutes how you 've been spending your time . Oh sure . You 're already interrupted every five to eight minutes anyway . Now you have to interrupt yourself every fifteen minutes on top of that ? Never . That 's exactly why most women do n't keep time logs . I 'm going to suggest something very effective and far less demanding . All you have to do is make your daily action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good . You have to make the list anyway . ) Then , when something comes along to distract you or when something keeps you from pursuing today 's direction , make a note in your planning notebook on today 's calendar page . It was this very exercise that proved to me how many interruptions I was seeking out . In just a few days I had such things on my interruption list as these : Went to the mall . ( This appeared three times . ) Went out to lunch . Rode to the city with Jim . Picked up videos . I hear you . " What 's wrong with a little spontaneity ? " " Are you telling me I ca n't go out to lunch anymore , or go to the mall ? " " You 're taking all the fun out of life . " Whoa ! Certainly there 's nothing wrong with doing any of the items on that interruption list . But remember , this exercise is to help you compare how you plan to spend your time with // what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ability to function , then you must discover the source of those interruptions . Before I realized I was the enemy , I was pointing that old finger of blame again ? at my husband , at our children , and at my boss . But I was causing most of my own problems . Me . I was the culprit . Of course , there were other interruptions on the lists . A few , I noticed , were constant and recurring . One son , ten years old , was always interrupting me when he needed his hair combed . Another boy was always thirsty for a glass of milk but was too small to handle a gallon jug . Thus , I had to continually stop what I was doing to comb hair and pour milk . Ah-ha , I thought . I can prevent these unnecessary interruptions ! I taught Steven how to comb his hair , and kept covered glasses of milk in the refrigerator for Jeffrey . Other items indicated that Jim was dumping a lot of his procrastinated jobs on me . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become both urgent and necessary ( car brakes , car inspections , check deposits , and so forth ) . So , using anticipation and communication , I 've been able to plan more effectively and eliminate many of those interruptions . At last I have more time for spontaneity ? guilt-free spontaneity at that . But I do try to weigh priorities so that those things which are most important are accomplished first . I always remember that too much careless abandon , too much spontaneity , is what got me into trouble in the first place . Try this exercise . It really wo n't hurt a bit . And if you do n't want to be chained to your planning notebook all day , keep an index card and pencil in your pocket to make notes . If you get to the end of the day and realize you did n't record one interruption , sit down and look at your day 's to-do list . What jobs were left uncompleted ? Note why you did n't get to them . Jot down any interruptions or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , you wo n't // remember every little interruption , but you 'll get a broad idea of how you spent your time . You can not begin to control your interruptions until you 're specifically aware of them . We all know that we 're interrupted incessantly , but until we know why , when , and by whom , we ca n't control the interruptions or eliminate the unnecessary ones . Whenever you incur an interruption , ask yourself if it is necessary or unnecessary . Could you have anticipated and prevented it ? Or did you seek it out or secretly welcome it ? Be brutally honest with yourself , and you 'll see interruptions drop in priority as your biggest time waster . 10 Here 's Your Hat ? What 's Your Hurry ? Controlling the Phone and Visitors No discussion of interruptions would be complete , I suppose , without giving consideration to the telephone . The phone , I dare say , has brought out the beast in me on numerous occasions . Here I am cleaning the front hall closet . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , two tennis rackets , a bait bucket , a tackle box , the vacuum cleaner , four dirty sweatshirts , a few unmatched socks , three ski boots , a thermos jug , a Creative Stitchery kit , a furnace filter , a couple of empty shoe boxes , and Mr. Potato Head , the phone rings . Untying my legs , I look for a weak spot in the pile where I can break through . Four rings , three bruises , a wrenched back , and two chipped nails later I pick up the impatient receiver . 98 // " Hello . This is Conrad the Computer . We at Cameraland hope you are having a nice day . We are . . . " Click . " I was having a nice day before you interrupted me , Conrad , " I fume . Now wait a minute . It was n't completely Conrad 's fault . After all , is it against the law to let the phone ring ? No , but that takes some self-discipline . Think about your phone calls . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important it could n't wait until later ? Personally , I have n't had one of those for over a year . Most of the calls we receive are not urgent and do n't need to be handled now , but for some reason we risk life , limb , and the pursuit of happiness just to uncover the mystery . Who is it ? What do they want ? Put yourself out of your misery . When you 're too busy to answer the phone , unplug it ! But what if the school should call ? Every school has a back-up number to call in case of emergency when the parents or legal guardians of the child ca n't be reached . If your back-up person lives close by , call her and say , " I 'm unplugging the phone for an hour . If the school calls , come and get me , I 'll be home . " Although telephone answering machines are scorned by many , they do provide a worthwhile service and keep you from being unnecessarily interrupted . With their popularity increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answering machine . I also enjoy the added reassurance that I 'm not interrupting anyone . In certain parts of the country answering machines are a way of life . Not only is there a chicken in every pot , but there 's a machine by every phone . Here are some other alternatives . Have your children answer the phone and take messages for you if you 're busy . Do n't worry about offending someone . I would rather leave a message than interrupt someone who 's soaking in a hot bath . // If it 's a telephone solicitor , the Better Business Bureau suggests that you ask the soliciting company to state its request in writing and to mail the information to you . One of my friends always responds by saying , " I 'm sorry . I never buy ( or subscribe to ) things over the phone . " To get your name removed from or added to national telephone-solicitation lists , contact the Telephone Preference Service , 6 East 43rd Street , New York , New York 10017 . Include your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Be sure to state whether you want to be added to or removed from the lists . This may not keep local businesses from contacting you , but perhaps you 'll eliminate some magazine subscription drives . You know , the ones that offer you five magazines a week and you pay only the shipping and handling charges . Translation : You get five magazines a month ( four of which you have no use for ) and they only cost you $124.28 a year . Such a deal . Suppose the caller is a real live person , an acquaintance , a friend , and there 's no time to visit . For heaven 's sake , if the caller is polite enough to ask , " Have you got a minute ? " or " Are you busy ? " ? be honest . " I 'm shampooing the carpet but I 'm never too busy for you . What can I do for you ? " But what if the friend wants to chat and you 're on your way out the front door ! Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . When is a good time for me to call you back ? " We women have a tremendous fear of offending , and that 's a noble quality , but honesty is also important and will be appreciated by true friends . And do you know what I 've discovered ? It 's only difficult to say , " I ca n't talk now " or " I 've got to run " the first few times . Sure , you 'll be scared and nervous , but as you do it , it 'll become easier and more natural . Another thing to consider is that you are sometimes the interrupter . Treat others with the same courtesy you 'd like to receive . " Are you busy ? " " Can you talk or do you want // me to call you back later ? " " Is this a bad time ? " When you 're calling someone for a particular reason , get to the point . The other party will appreciate it . One Christmas I was the neighborhood chairman in charge of rounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Basically , all I had to do was call all my neighbors and ask for donations . I 'll never forget the warm response I got from one expert time manager . " Hi , Joann . This is Deniece . I 'm in charge of the sub-forSanta project this year . " At that point Joann interrupted me and said , " Great ! What can I do to help ? " I have never forgotten that conversation , though it occurred seven or eight years ago . She valued her time and she valued mine , yet she was eager to help me and I truly felt the warmth of her charity . What can I do for you ? How can I help ? What do you need ? All are sincere , caring words that help you to get to the point of the conversation . If you 're visiting with someone in person and you must call time on the visit , again , use good manners . Look at your watch while you 're talking , interrupt yourself , and say , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say your goodbyes . If you and the other person are sitting , stand up only when you are talking . Here 's one last tip for dodging interruptions : If it 's possible , schedule some quiet time for yourself . If you 're working , try to squeeze in at least one quiet time session a week . One friend of ours is a virtuoso at the piano and requires of herself one hour of uninterrupted practice every day . She prepares lunch for her boys , turns on Sesame Street , and sits down at the piano . She has taught the children not to leave the family room or to interrupt her unless it 's an emergency . Another friend hires a babysitter to watch her children so she can go to her study to work on a novel she 's writing . The children are safe and well attended to at home , and Mom 's right nearby . I have two friends who signed up for art and sewing classes . Neither woman actually needs art or sewing lessons // because they 're both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to enjoy their skills . An added plus : the mess is contained in a school building four miles away from home ! Another way to grab a few minutes of peace is to use naptime . A child 's nap is the glue that holds a mother together , so take advantage of it . As soon as the child goes down for a nap , stop whatever you 're doing and begin your quiet-time activity . When the child awakens , get back to whatever you were doing before he or she went to sleep . Maybe a more insouciant approach would work . When I wrote my third book , Schuyler was two and a half years old , so I spent most of my time at the library to remove myself from her necessary interruptions . She was left in the care of her father or her brothers and was n't too disturbed by my absence , yet she still remembers it . This time ( she 's four now ) I just reasoned with her . " Schuy , Mom 's working on another book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone for a while ? If you really need something , come and get me , okay ? Otherwise , I 'll have to go back to the library to work on the book . " She 's old enough now to understand my reasoning and to entertain herself . Every so often she comes in for a reassuring hug , or she wants me to rock one of her babies to sleep , but basically she 's been very cooperative . Actually , the library is a great place to get away . It 's quiet and peaceful , and you can take the kids with you . Take them to story hour , and while they 're being entertained , relax and enjoy yourself . The car is another hideout that 's often overlooked , though it 's pretty much a fair-weather friend . Reading , writing , thinking , paperwork , job-related projects , crafts ? many things can be performed in the quiet solitude of your car . ( This idea is very beneficial to a person whose job involves frequent interruptions. ) // Also , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet block of time , look for an unused office or conference room . Is there a small restaurant or snack shop close to your office ? If so , occupy one of the nethermost tables while you outline a report , write a rough draft , or organize a sales territory . Interruptions have the unprecedented power to kill your whole day , yet by controlling them you can easily save two hours ! Wo n't you try some of these ideas ? With a little thought and some imagination , you 'll quickly discover solutions that work well for you . 11 Pulling the Plug Learn to Tame the TV " Krystle fears Blake has fallen in love with Alexis again ; Amanda disappears ; Leslie Carrington meets Adam and her old friend Dex .

We position our chairs , gobble down bags of Cheetos and pounds of popcorn , and before long all that Cosby Show spirit has settled firmly about the hips . 104 // Families separate into groups cloistered around different TV sets so as not to miss a favorite program . Channel zappers flip feverishly from one station to the next , avoiding commercials and searching for something more interesting . A barrage of advertisements make us ( and especially our children ) think we do n't have all the things we should have ? that we do n't have all the things we need ! But the bottom line is that every time we plop down in front of the tube , we 're substituting a slice of our lives for the sake of a superstation . Yes , I watch television . And sometimes I sit there vegetating and enjoy every minute of it . But I 've been an addict , and I had to learn how to keep TV watching within reasonable parameters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , I turned to the television to absorb empty , unfulfilled hours . I became a game-show zealot . I would freeze in a state of suspended animation waiting to see if contestant number one would choose door number two on " Let 's Make a Deal . " I gasped in horror as the reigning champ risked it all and lost it on " Jeopardy . " I shouted answers to unknowing contestants on " Password . " The seemingly innocent viewing of one soap opera led to the destruction of entire afternoons as the cliff-hanging conclusion of one show spilled into another 's gripping plot . I 'll never forget one afternoon when I was perched in my usual spot , staring with prolonged passionate interest at the scene unfolding before my eyes . Our little boy , then two and a half , said , " Is that the mean grandma ? " Though I quickly answered , " Yes , " that one piercing question was so thought-provoking that I could n't dismiss it from my mind . That grandma was mean . She was evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite that woman over for dinner ? Would I want her anywhere near my precious little boy ? Certainly not . Yet , I was doing just that every day . Every time I touched the dial I was welcoming the mean grandma and her equally disgusting cohorts into our living room . I was allowing the motley bunch to associate with my son . // That was all it took . I went cold turkey ? no more soap operas from that day on . Game shows , though , were harmless , I thought , so I threw myself into them with even more fervor . Then I gradually realized I was making out of my life a wasteland of human potential . The hours in front of the TV were keeping me from those achievement-oriented tasks so vital to a happy , fulfilling life . Golden moments to teach and play with our children were squandered . I needed a major TV-time budget cut . Perhaps you 're not as far gone as I was . ( And if you 're working , certainly you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the effects television is having on your family . Regardless of the role TV plays in your life , if you 're interested in loosening its grasp , here are a few ways to tame the tube . 1 . Decide objectively and in advance what programs you 're going to watch . If you change channels the way the aforementioned Alexis changes clothes ( which is to say often ) , you 're going to be sucked into whatever comes along . So decide what you will watch ; then , when your selected show is over , turn off the TV or leave the room if others are still watching . Television producers know how to attract viewers . Just before the program airs they often show what 's called a teaser , which is meant to pique your interest so you 'll stay tuned . Another ploy is to postpone the first commercial for fifteen or twenty minutes so you 'll be hooked into the plot , wanting to see who does what to whom and how . Do n't tempt yourself . Just get up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . 2 . Do n't get involved with all of the new series offered at the beginning of the new TV season in the fall . You 'll never miss what you 've never seen . 3 . Get up during the commercials and do something else . Unload the dishwasher , water the plants , vacuum the carpet , read an article , or write a thank-you note . // 4 . If you 're a game-show-aholic , you need to know that only a fraction of the time the show is on the air is actually spent playing the game . The bulk of the time is spent joking with guests and touting products that are given as prizes . Decide that you 'll watch the game show only on certain days . Or tune in only for the fast-money round , the big deal , the bonus minute . That way , you 'll get to enjoy the thrill of victory or , more likely , the agony of defeat .

A friend of ours who is a schoolteacher has kept up with one soap opera for eight years just by talking to parents at parent-teacher conferences .

Over a period of eight years she has accrued nearly three solid months of time . 6 . Leave the house . Go shopping , attend a concert , sign up for a lecture series , work out , visit a friend .

Turn off the TV when no one is watching . ( If you just have it on for noise , turn on the stereo or the radio instead . ) Television is so seductive that it will lure you to it unawares .

And what about your closet . Would I discover three sets of clothes ?
