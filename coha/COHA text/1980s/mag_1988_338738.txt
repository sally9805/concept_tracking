The first principle of vice-presidential selection is to find a fellow who can win his own state ( the bigger , the better ) and not hurt you elsewhere . Safe , practical politics . Michael Dukakis has often said his first principle in selecting a running mate was more exalted : to find the person , apart from himself of course , who would make a first-rate President . A noble , if slightly disingenuous sentiment . <P> But in choosing Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen to share space on his campaign button , Dukakis took a deeply calculated risk , an atypical gamble . Bentsen is not a shoo-in to win Texas , George Bush 's adopted state . He could hurt the ticket by being perceived as an affront to the blacks and progressives who backed Jesse Jackson and by sullying the PAC-free sheen of the squeaky-clean Dukakis . And though he is greatly respected in the corridors of the Capitol , Bentsen does not top the list when people daydream about the ideal President of the United States . <P> For Dukakis , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shrewd . If Bentsen wins Texas , Dukakis may win the whole enchilada ; since Texas became a state in 1845 , no Democrat has won without it . Bush will now have to spend time and money defending the South . And , with this once safe electoral base threatened , Bush can not afford to shrug off a loss in California . <P> In measuring the odds , however , Dukakis did not adequately consider one very large and unpredictable variable : Jesse Jackson . The gray and proper Bentsen would not exactly excite the 7 million who voted for the " rainbow coalition . " That was understood . But then the sorry-I-missed-you phone call hit Jesse where he is most vulnerable : his sense of pride , his rightful insistence that he has earned respect . The missed connection permitted him to play to his greatest strength : attracting the media eye . For days after the announcement , Jackson 's parade of grievances and implied reprisals shifted the soft-spoken Bentsen off the front pages . <P> The Texas Tory and the Brookline Bantam make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Dukakis ' . Bentsen supports the contras ; Dukakis reviles them . Dukakis mocks the policies of Reaganomics ; Bentsen backed them . Bentsen boosts new missiles ; Dukakis denigrates them . <P> The choice of Bentsen was something of a surprise ; so too the generally laudatory reaction . He carries some campaign liabilities : his age and general lack of zip , as well as a silky style that makes it hard for Middle-Class Mike to depict Silver-Spoon George as a country-club elitist . Bentsen 's willingness to wallow in contributions from those with business before his Finance Committee makes it tougher for Dukakis to exploit the Reagan Administration 's " sleaze factor . " <P> But Dukakis , as Bentsen pointed out , " was n't looking for a clone of Mike Dukakis . " He was looking for someone who would give the ticket balance , and by choosing one of the most probusiness , prodefense Southerners around , he got it . " It makes our problems much more difficult , " says Republican John Connally , a former Texas Governor . Bentsen helps shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him and makes the ticket more appealing to the Bubba vote : conservative whites who defected to Ronald Reagan .
