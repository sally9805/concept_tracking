Armani 's strength is consolidated , his influence lasting . The fashion world pays homage , genuflects and , like a child peeking out from behind prayers , starts casing the sanctuary for a little diversion . Some are suggesting that the next big fashion push will come from Japan . Others-like Kal Ruttenstein , fashion director of Bloomingdale 's , who wears " only Armani , " and Daniel Hechter , Europe 's top-selling men 's sportswear designer-believe that the U.S. will come to the ascendancy . If they are right , here are a couple of kings and two comers who will be riding the crest of the wave : <P> RALPH LAUREN . Tom Wolfe once derided Lauren 's " Savile Pseud suits , " and backpacking types have been known to mutter about the imposed funk of his Western look . But no one has so codified American traditionalism , or mined it quite so profitably , as Ralph Lauren . His Polo ( for men ) and Ralph Lauren ( for women ) labels , with their assorted subsidiaries , sidelines and licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His logo of a mallet-wielding polo player has galloped across everything from ties to dresses , saddle blankets to note pads , and is well on the way to giving the Lacoste alligator a smart konk on the noggin . <P> Lauren , like Armani , began as a designer of men 's wear , and both started cutting from the same English bias . The man from Milan worked his unstructured radicalization ; Lauren stayed as close as possible to tradition , re-establishing and rejustifying it . His clothes , at first , were deliberately evocative of the 1920s and made their way- in a fashion that would both help and haunt him-into the 1974 film The Great Gatsby . More recently , Lauren has looked west for inspiration . His " prairie look " last fall for women , with the hem of a petticoat peeking out from under a skirt worn with a Navajo colored sweater , was fresh , simple and somewhat startling . It was also a smash , and will be repeated , with modifications , this fall . <P> The popular success of Chariots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetus for Lauren , 42 , to turn back to his beginnings . Many of this fall 's clothes for men and women will feature a British accent , with lots of strict tailoring : heathery tweeds for men , an elongated Norfolk jacket for women worn with a contrasting tweed skirt . Fabrics immaculate , tailoring impeccable : the best off-the-rack American stuff that comes to hand . Wearing Ralph Lauren is not exactly like falling into Jay Gatsby 's closet ; it is more like joining one of John O'Hara 's country clubs . <P> PERRY ELLIS . If Armani rewrote the fashion book , Perry Ellis took a very close look at his opening chapter . " If we want to be honest , " Armani says , " it is not only Perry Ellis but Calvin Klein who has gotten inspiration from my things . But I 'd say that , perhaps , Calvin Klein is more of a stylist who can transform a good idea into a commercial success . Perry Ellis is more courageous . He produces a fashion more genuinely his .
