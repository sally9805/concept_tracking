As a researcher at the U.S. Census Bureau , Jean Moorman was besieged with calls from incredulous friends and reporters last February . A Yale-Harvard study had estimated that only 2.6% of college-educated women who were still single at 40 were likely ever to marry . Unmarried 30-year-old college graduates were not much better off : only 20% were likely to wed . Skeptical , Moorman decided to do a study of her own . Her preliminary report , released last week , has cheer for post-20s women who hope to exchange first-time vows . <P> Using projections from the 1980 census , Moorman estimates 66% of college- educated 30-year-old women will someday marry , as will 23% of 40-year-olds and 11% of 45-year-olds . She concedes her figures may be a bit high , but believes the Yale-Harvard numbers , which are based on a different statistical model , are too low . Says Moorman : " I just did n't think life should be that way . " <P> CHART : TEXT NOT AVAILABLE             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
