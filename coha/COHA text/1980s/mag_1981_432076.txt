 | Not so long ago , Baltimoreans say , the highlight of summer entertainment here was watching crabs dig holes in the shore of Chesapeake Bay . That 's not the case now . This year , the city is a beehive of warm-weather plays , circuses and mimes ? all part of the Baltimore International Theatre Festival , which has attracted troupes and audiences from around the world . " This season , it 's a case of people having more entertainment than they know what to do with , " says Hope Quackenbush , executive producer of the festival . The event is typical of what is happening across the country : An explosion of summer arts . Estimates are that attendance at midyear performances of theater , opera , dance and orchestras will reach 10 million this year ? more than triple the number in 1975 . Leading the way are orchestras that expect to attract up to 4 million customers this summer at centers such as Tanglewood in Massachusetts , Blossom in Ohio , Ravinia in Illinois and Robin Hood Dell in Pennsylvania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high of about 2.5 million . Forecasts are that theater ? including summer stock in Brunswick , Me. , and Shakespeare in San Diego ? will attract 2 million customers . Opera is expected to draw about a million . One of the largest summer auditoriums is Wolf Trap Farm near Washington , D.C. , the nation 's only performingarts center operated by the National Park Service . In its 10th year , the complex in the rolling , green Virginia countryside is prepared for more than a halfmillion spectators . Offerings include the New York City Opera , the Netherlands Dance Theater and singers Johnny Cash and Harry Belafonte . " Good entertainment . " Carol V. Harford , president of the Wolf Trap Foundation , which creates programs for the park , says the scope of such offerings has been a big factor in attracting ever bigger audiences . " Not many years ago , " she notes , " the performing arts dropped off to almost nothing in the summer . Now , people are getting used to good entertainment of all sorts all year long . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of orchestral seasons . " The first big centers , such as Saratoga , N.Y. , and Ravinia near Chicago , were really built for orchestras . Once the structures were there , it made it possible to book all sorts of performances . " At Wolf Trap and many other warmweather auditoriums , the atmosphere  | is decidedly different from the more formal surroundings of big inner-city stages . Many people , dressed in clothes ranging from tuxedos to bathing suits , picnic on lawns before performances , and often prefer to watch the presentations from blankets under the stars rather than in reserved seats . At some festivals , such as the Chamber Music Northwest in Portland , Oreg. , musicians enjoy direct exchanges with the audience ? sometimes at picnics before performances and often on stage immediately after concerts . " People here are pretty conservative musically , " explains Linda Magee , executive director of the Portland series . " And they make no secret of it when they do n't like something , especially some modern works . " Another incentive for warm-weather audiences : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Wolf Trap costs as little as $3 . Seats at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and the Kennedy Center in Washington may run to $50 and more . Says Harford : " All this has brought a broad variety of people , especially the young , to summer performances . We think it has been an important contribution to the growth of the arts in this country . " " A special thing . " The biggest expansion has been in large cities such as New York , where activities range from dancing outdoors at Lincoln Center to the Metropolitan Opera in Central Park . Recently , in anticipation of an evening performance of " Tosca , " an audience that eventually swelled to more than 150,000 started gathering in early morning , braving some of the worst heat and humidity of the year . Singer Renata Scotto , playing the role of Tosca , noted that many spectators stay all day and well into the evening on the grounds , making the occasion " a special thing . " Smaller cities , too , have established summer cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Spoleto Festival provides offerings from opera to drama that have drawn spectators from throughout the country . Another medium-sized community that built a successful midyear arts season is Des Moines . When the Des Moines Metro Opera established a summer opera festival nine years ago , it was a small operation , with a budget of only $22,000 . Now the season includes three major operas , runs more than three weeks and is budgeted at $300,000 . " That kind of money buys a lot in Iowa , " observes Robert L. Larsen , artistic director . " This is very good opera , and people here have become firstclass opera buffs . They come once , and then they 're hooked . " Dance is the major attraction in Durham , N.C. , where sizable audiences are flocking to the American Dance Festival . Participating groups include the Dance Theatre of Harlem , the Pilobolus Dance Theatre and the North Carolina Dance Theater . Producer Quackenbush of Baltimore says some people still think summer cultural events are inferior to those presented in winter ? " but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country 12 months a year .
