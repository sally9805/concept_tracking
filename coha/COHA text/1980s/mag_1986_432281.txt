 | Having created a new woman last decade , let 's see what we can do to reinvent the man . We 'll start with the pores . " Five years ago I started getting big pores around my nose and cheeks , " says Gary Kaestle , 28 , a Pasadena , Calif. , policeman , a 225-pound weight lifter and the father of two . " That 's when I started worrying about wrinkles and stuff . " Kaestle 's quest led him to a department store , which sold him the entire line of Clinique skin-care products for men , including customized soap , toner , moisturizer and deep-cleaning " skin scrub . " Evolution to a new level of consciousness so often begins with a simple question ; Kaestle , wondering how he could shrink his pores , was merely completing the process begun by Germaine Greer when she first asked why she had to care about hers at all . Women 's lives have never been the same since ; and as for Kaestle , he says , " My skin texture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Behold the man of the future , turning an unblemished face toward the east to catch the unspoiled ultraviolets of the morning , glancing down for reassurance at the indispensable gauge of his progress . His mirror . We have come a long way , it would seem , from the days when all a man asked of his skin was that it grow hair and , when shaved , stop bleeding before he got to the office . A long way , too , from the simpler days when the most important fashion accessory a man could have was a beautiful woman on his arm ? all the way to Pierce Brosnan , star of the NBC series " Remington Steele , " whose televised touches of elegant excess add up to a fashion statement so self-contained that no woman alive could be anything but a distraction . We have come far , for that matter , from the 1960s. the most recent of a number of epochs in which males usurped the decorative function of the human species ( page 52 ) . The style of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gray face of convention ; the style of today is based on casual elegance , polished understatement and intensive scouring of pores . Of the fashion innovations of that seminal decade , only three seem to have retained their relevance : blue jeans ; T shirts with funny sayings on them , and the central myth of modern consumer society , that individuality can be expressed through the selection of mass-produced goods . The thousand-dollar suit : The big change , of course , is that while the polyester-based excrescences of the ' 60s were widely affordable , elegance by its nature is not . It may be , as Neiman-Marcus vice president Jim Guerra observed , that the rise of the twoincome family has freed men to spend more on themselves without guilt ; in any case . 1986 looks like the year in which top-of-theline men 's designer suits cross the thousand-dollar barrier and haircuts at top New York salons go above $50 . NEWSWEEK 's answer to Remington Steele , General Editor Bill Barol , selected a $950 Giorgio Armani as part of his one-day make-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ( page 58 ) . Dr. Frank Dunton , a Dallas plastic surgeon , expects that about 15 percent of his patients this year will be men seeking face-lifts , at a total cost , generally not reimbursed by insurance , of some $6,000 . Nationwide the percentage of men seeking cosmetic surgery is even higher , about 20 to 25 percent , up from near zero 10 or 15 years ago . A three-day " metamorphosis " at Panache Appearance Studios in Torrance , Calif. ? including hair , skin , body , nail and eyeglass analysis and an individual shopping trip with fashion consultant Christine Kunzelman ? now costs $645 . The program was designed with women in mind , but in seven years the proportion of clients who are men has gone from 10 percent to nearly half . This should also be a good year for the business of epidermal scruffing . Men 's skin-care products are generally priced about the same as similar products for women ( in many cases they are the identical product , except f'or the packaging ) ? which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no more than a man thinks his own skin is worth . Sage Ltd. , a salon in the tony St. Louis suburb of Creve Coeur , sells custom-blended shaving cream at more than $3 an ounce . " Men , " says Sage 's president Barbara Strickland , " will buy whatever you suggest for their skin , but they want results . " ( She adds that men tend to be more faithful than women in following a skin-care program , although the reason may be that they have n't had @#  | time to become disillusioned yet . ) A number of companies better known for their women 's cosmetics have begun men 's skincare lines , in some cases because men were already buying lotions ( or not buying them and dipping into their wives ' supplies ) . Estee Lauder , Inc. , under its own name and its Aramis and Clinique brands , has threequarters of the men 's market , according to one analyst . Elizabeth Arden markets a line of men 's products by designer Karl Lagerfeld . All told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million last year -- a small fraction of both women 's skin-treatment sales and the billion-dollar business in men 's fragrances . But the figure was up 16 percent in a year , while sales of the latter two hardly grew at all . ' Obsessive nectar ' : In the last seven years at least two companies ? California-based Interface Inc. and Jan Stuart Corp. , in New York ? have been founded specifically to sell skin lotions , creams and soap to men . The business is still young . Companies have had to learn to avoid the romantic hooey that always sold women 's cosmetics in favor of a tough-minded , results-oriented , scientific hooey . The names for Jan Stuart 's original products were taken from the works of Persian poet Omar Khayyam , but they have been dropped in favor of simple descriptive titles . " Obsessive Nectar " is selling much better as " Honey/Almond Granular Facial Scrub . " This is said to " slough off dead skin layers , lift out ingrown hairs and prevent shaving bumps , " among other benefits ; one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh oatmeal cookie . Interface created a sleek , clinical white packaging for its products , four of which are sold together f'or $44 as a " Workout Kit " : a " deep cleanser , " a " toner , " a " moisturizer " and the " Gripper Workout Mask , " a green liquid that hardens on the face to the point of muffling speech , in the process " isometrically exercising the 32 sets of facial muscles for a smoother and tighter skin . " One of the most visible signs of the new male vanity is in the number of publications that have sprung up to serve it . Obviously believing that men 's fashion is just the flip side of women 's , Fairchild publications brought out ' M ' magazine in 1983 as a complement to W , ' helping to define the lifestyle of " the civilized man . " Just within the past year , " Men 's Guide to Fashion " ( MGF ) was begun to help its readers decide such pressing lifestyle questions as " Are You Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines for blacks ? Ebony Man and Modern Black Men ? have made their appearance . The leader in the field by far , however , is GQ , which in recent years has shed its largely gay- and trade-oriented image and boosted circulation to 645,000 , divided , according to editor-in-chief Arthur Cooper , between " men who can afford the kind of lifestyle reflected in the magazine and younger guys who kind of look at it as a dream book . " And what are they dreaming about ? Of the savoir-faire of Chicago architect Helmut Jahn , whose GQ cover profile noted that " he dresses like he designs : to kill . " ( Among the deadliest items in his wardrobe : " purple leather loafers " and a @#  | " wide-brimmed gray gangster fedora . " ) Of the elegance of Jim McMullen , 38 , a former fashion model and owner of a fashionable New York restaurant , who owns about a dozen Paul Stuart suits and spends between $7,000 and $10,000 on clothes a year . Of the passion for excellence of Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying on as many as three shirts before settling on the one he is willing to be seen in that evening . " It does seem abit stupid , " he says , " but you have to do it . " Above all , young American men are dreaming of the insouciance of " Miami Vice " stars Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas , in whose T shirts and shapeless pastel blazers they see the authentic outlines of what young men have always craved , irresponsible glamour . " The ' Miami Vice ' thing is going to be one of the most important influences for this spring and summer , " predicts Chip Tolbert , fashion director for the Men 's Fashion Association of America . ( Unfortunately by next television season the clothes will be superseded by the show itself , which is reportedly moving toward hotter colors and deeper , richer shades . ) One place to look for its influence is in church , where the stylish groom will be seen in the " Miami Vice " rental tuxedo from After Six , Inc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " fiesta blue . " ( The Philadelphia-based company considered , but rejected , a line of wedding T shirts to go with the tuxedos . ) In a chorus of praise for the show 's healthy fashion values from the nation 's haberdashers , a rare note of dissent was sounded in Kansas City . Howard Novorr , the 64-year-old owner of Michael 's Clothing , considers the " Miami Vice " look fine " for little kids , but not a professional look for a business man . " The avant-garde in Kansas City , he reports , is moving into hats , colorful suspenders and bow ties , and in his opinion , as a lifelong bow-tie wearer , it 's about time . " The younger men like them . Style is returning with the younger men , " he says . Fair enough . But why should it be happening now , after years in which , as Novorr observes , they were content to walk into a room with 20 other men all wearing the same suit ? Why , for that matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enlarged pores suddenly have emerged as urgent health issues at cosmetics companies ? One popular view is that it is the natural result of the fitness boom , which has always had its component of vanity . Men whose torsos are as smooth and firm as marble are unlikely to want to show the world a face with the consistency of acoustic ceiling tile . Another , probably less significant , contribution of exercise is cited by Kaestle , the Pasadena cop , who notes that after jogging three to five miles most evenings , " I take a lot of showers , and that really dries out my skin . " Writers and cranks : On the other hand , taking the longest possible view , some authorities actually consider pastel blazers and skin scruffing as inevitable outcomes of the decline of the family farm , the one economic unit whose members are pretty much free of having to worry about how they 're dressed . " People dress up to go to work , " points out Dennis W. Rook , an assistant professor of marketing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more decadent . " However , a study for the Celanese Corp. , a leading fiber manufacturer , found that the city where men spend the most on business clothing is not New York , the nation 's fashion ( and arguably decadence ) headquarters , but Atlanta . Aaron Meyers , Atlanta regional vice president of Tom James Clothiers , says that is only natural in a city of salesmen and regional managers , " just the type of people who must put their best foot forward . " New York , on the other hand , is populated by writers and such like cranks for whom putting their best foot forward would constitute an admission that they ca n't make it on talent alone . Their hero is Van Gordon Sauter , the immaculately donnish executive vice president of CBS , Inc. , whose carefully nurtured eccentricities represent a vanity no less intense for being presumably invisible to an assistant vice president for marketing at Coca-Cola . In " strategic business clothing , " according to Michael R. Solomon , a consumer psychologist at New York University 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigidity and continuity . " " Everybody 's trying to look like Iacocca , " says Norman Karr , executive director of the Men 's Fashion Association . " They 're saying they 're team players through their clothes . " In Atlanta , rigidity is not just a slogan . Susan Bixler , a leading fashion consultant and the founder of Professional Image Inc. , expects to gross nearly $1 million this year laying down the law to employees of such companies as IBM , AT &T; and Hewlett-Packard . One client was Larry Kraxberger , a real-estate developer who found increased business success after he lost 30 pounds , switched from offthe-rack to tailor-made suits and began using a moisturizer . He did all that on his own , and then hired Bixler to lec-  | ture his 65 employees on grooming . " The results were amazing , " he said . " She targeted our problem people for me . They listened and apparently learned something . " Bixler recognizes that different companies have different needs and standards , but a few principles are universal , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of telephone-sales executives , she was so persuasive on the subject of cleanshavedness that five salesmen shaved off their mustaches during a coffee break . Clothing manufacturers are not loath to capitalize on this insecurity . Hart Schaffner &; Marx has gone so far as to register the name " The Right Suit , " which it promotes with the ominous slogan , " The Right Suit might not help you close the deal . But the wrong suit could easily close you out . " Creeping Iacoccaism during the day is , of course , in opposition to the rampant pastels of the " Miami Vice " look for night . The result , according to fashion perts , has been an increasing specializ. : - tion of men 's fashion , or , to put it blunt ' . more money spent on clothes . Men , says Karr of the fashion association , are accumulating separate wardrobes " for my public self and the real me . " In the pursuit of an executive aura . a small but growing number of young men with perfectly good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# @# @#  | office . ( The preferred shape for projecting authority : square . ) They can be stowed in the glove compartment the rest of the time . Unfortunately , men who want to wear , say , mustaches , do n't have that option . But it is possible to get a haircut that converts from business wear to high-style evening wear . " I 'm getting more and more men who want something convertible , " says Andre Tavernise , " creative director " of New York 's trendy Bumble+Bumble salon . " Something they can wear to work and kind of comb to the side and look corporate , and then at night put some mousse or gel on and slick it back or make it stand up . It 's great . I love hearing it . " Men have always been vain about their hair , in a sense , but what they mostly cared about was that it stay attached to their heads . Now , says Luke O'Connor , a hairdresser at the stylish Menage a Trois salon in Beverly Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles or movie stars ? an exercise in wishful thinking that for a long time only women were thought capable of . From a hairdresser 's point of view this is a mixed blessing , since only dynamite will suffice to get such men off the chair , out of the smock and away from the mirror . No question , men have discovered the psychic benefits of attractiveness ? some men more than others , of course . Tom Wolfe ca n't sit down to write in his own apartment without dressing in one of his impeccably tailored suits and immaculate ties . Solomon 's research showed that Los Angeles men were most likely to agree with the statement , " When I look good , I feel good . " ( Chicagoans , on the other hand , by and large considered it a lot of baloney . ) " When I look good and feel good , I love walking down the street , " said New York actor and musician Sherwin Rosman , 27 , as he sat through an elaborate styling and highlighting of his shoulder-length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy towards me . Even the construction workers holler . " The possibility of attracting the attention of construction workers , of course , is precisely what kept many men out of salons for so many years . But the vast shift in the dynamics of male-female relations over the last 20 years has had its effect here , too : men are finding that to attract women they need to be , of all things , attractive . Balance of power : That was n't always the case . " When you control the resources as men once did , almost exclusively you do n't worry about your personal desirability , " Solomon says , referring to what might be called the Onassis Effect . This phenomenon was once taken for granted in our society , but in its most conspicuous forms it is confined today to a few fringe areas such as Las Vegas casinos and Florida racetracks in February . " The influx of women into responsible positions in the workplace has shifted the balance of power , " Solomon observes . As usual , the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a recent ad the male model wearing the suit is relegated to a small box near the bottom of the page , dwarfed by a close-up of a beautiful woman who appears to be murmuring : " He 's wearing my favorite brand of suit again . " Many women , of course , are pleased by this turn of events : glad to have men shoulder some of the burden of being attractive for a change , delighted not to have to look at shaving bumps and ingrown hairs , relieved that men can go out and buy their own face cream and stop using theirs . In particular , Suzy Mallery , founder of Man Watchers Inc. , a group that organizes male beauty contests , considers the flowering of male vanity " neat . " She worries , though , that men , through ignorance , will take the wrong route to attractiveness . Her own polling shows that while most men imagine women desire big bulging muscles and broad shoulders , in fact women are most often attracted to slim , narrowhipped men who stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is one that Los Angeles women have been living with for a long time : the exasperation of dating a man who stops every few steps to check his spit curl in shop windows , who wo n't go to a restaurant if he 's not sure he 's dressed for it , who wo n't make love because it means staying up too late , whose one jeweled earring looks better than her two . " We are creating one type of man , " says Mallery , " who is like the beautiful woman we used to criticize ? all wrapped up in his looks . " Nor is this phenomenon exclusive to the narcissistic environs of Hollywood . " Richard combs his hair constantly , even when we 're out driving , " complains Linda Tribe of her fiance , a Dallas carpenter . " At home , he 'll just stand in front of the mirror and comb his hair this way , then that way . I think it 's kind of odd . " He takes two or three showers a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job at a construction site . " I think one change of clothes would be enough , " says Tribe , who of course is the one who has to wash them . Ahh , but what do women know about this stuff , anyway ? How can they understand the subtleties that go into the choice of a scent to complement a man 's mood , a necktie to set off his tan , a scruffer to rout out his pores ? Will they ever know the ineffable sensation related by William F. Gibson , a 33-year-old vice president of a Maryland investment bank , of combining the right Paul Stuart suit ( among the 17 he owns ) with the right Hermes tie ( of 75 ) and the perfect Gucci shoes ( among 12 pairs ) , of striding confidently into a meeting under a gleaming helmet of styled hair to " project an image that says , Yes , he 's Wall Street . He is a mergers and acquisitions guy ' . " NEWSWEEK : APRIL 14 , 1986 55      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
