@#  | Instant videofax - Picture this : Use your video camera to photograph a child , a vacation scene , secret documents ? whatever . Now plug the camera into your computer and see a single frame displayed on the screen . Then whisk that image instantly over a telephone line to any fax machine in the world , so that a friend , grandparent , or master spy gets the picture , pronto . Dream stuff ? No more . An English company , Eltime Vision Systems , has successfully linked together the disparate technologies of video , computer , and facsimile transmission to make this scenario possible . The system , called Videofax , furnishes two plug-in circuit boards for installation in the Amstrad 1512 or 1640 personal computer or any other compatible device . One board grabs a single frame from the video signals of the video camera and displays it on the computer monitor . The other board , connected to a telephone , converts the TV picture into standard facsimile signals . The single-frame image can also be stored on a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video format or as fax signals for later transmission . The system has been used to send display it on a monitor , and transmit it to a fax machine by phone . X-ray pictures and pathology lab slides from one hospital to another . Possible uses are manifold : networking pictures of criminal suspects among police departments and security firms , for example . Dem bones , dem bones A team consisting of two astronomers , a physicist , a mathematician , and an East Asian language professor have determined that an Earth day was 47/l000ths of a second shorter at the beginning of the 14th century than it is today . The evidence : inscriptions on Chinese oracle bones . The bones are actually pieces of tortoise shell , and were used by seers to foretell the future during China 's Shang Dynasty in the 14th century . Unknown until they were discovered by accident in 1899 , more than 100,000 of the ancient bones have since been excavated in the city of Anyang , capital of the Shang Dynasty . The inscriptions that gave researchers an astronomical clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1302 B.C. One side of an oracle bone reads : " Diviner Ko asks if the following day will be sunny or not . " It was dated the 51st day of the cycle then in use in the traditional imperial Chinese calendar system . The other side of the bone gave the answer and the clue : " ... 52nd day , fog until next dawn . Three flames ate the sun , and big stars were seen . " Kevin D. Pang , an astronomer at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory , and his colleagues interpreted the " three flames " as coronal streamers flicking out from the sun 's surface . They , and the stars seen during daytime , marked the event as a total eclipse of the sun . Using computers to plot the dates and paths of total solar eclipses observable in Shang China , and by a process of elimination , the JPL team pinpointed the eclipse as having occurred on June 5 , 1302 B.C. Next , the researchers used a computer model of Earth 's rotation to learn how fast the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on that date from Anyang . ( A rotation faster or slower than the actual rate would have shifted the path of totality to the east or the west of where the eclipse was observed . ) The answer is a day 47/l000ths of a second shorter than the present day . The result , says Pang , is consistent with other studies of ancient eclipses . Pang 's colleagues included language professor Hung-hsiang Chou of the University of California at Los Angeles ; physicist Kevin Yau of Durham University in England ; astronomer John A. Bangert of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington , D.C. ; and mathematician Dharam V. Ahluwalia of JPL . Smallest lasers The campus of North Carolina State University now boasts what is billed as the world 's smallest laser . It consists of a layer of indium arsenide just one atom thick , measuring 3.25 angstroms .

Getting the bran out The striking computer graphic above is an image of a kernel of wheat made by a computer-aided engineering program like that used to simulate stress tests of aircraft parts . Why stress-test a wheat kernel ? To improve the process that separates the outer bran layer from the inner endosperm , which yields wheat flour . The U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Research Service in Albany , Calif. , is conducting the experiment . " Increased efficiency of large flour mills would be possible if the bran layer could be separated more precisely from the inner kernel , " says Gregory M. Glenn of the USDA . In the mills , rollers twist and crush kernels from above and below to strip the bran . Energy is wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increasing milling costs and adding undesirable quantities of bran and ash to the flour . In a preliminary test , the computer program accurately predicted where the kernel would crack ( pink area ) if pressure were applied at the kernel sections labeled as green ( highest pressure ) and yellow ( less-intense pressure ) . Space mirrors Among NASA 's plans for astronomy missions is the launch in late 1991 of the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer , a satellite that will carry a $40-million payload including four telescopes to map the extreme ultraviolet regime of the sky . This radiation band ( 100 to 900 angstroms ) , lying between ultraviolet light and X-rays , has not been extensively explored until now . In the photo at the bottom of this page , the special mirrors for the telescopes are being inspected after they have been machined and polished at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore , Calif . They are being assembled into telescopes by researchers at the University of California Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory . The mirrors are of the type known as " grazing-incidence " because starlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas mirrors used for visible light astronomy are " normal-incidence " because they are pointed directly at a light source David Finley , an optics scientist at Berkeley , explains : " In the case of extreme ultraviolet light we want to focus as much as possible of the star 's light into a tight image , and since the light we 're looking at is at such short wavelengths , the mirrors ' surfaces must be aspheric in shape to provide a sharp image , and close to perfectly smooth , so that scattering does not blur the star images . " How smooth ? The average roughness of the surface of the mirrors is 13 angstroms , equivalent to the thickness of seven atoms . " It is only in recent years , " says Lawrence Livermore mechanical engineer John Taylor , " that a few researchers worldwide have been able to make the The as-yet-unexplored extreme ultra- tored by satellite telescopes using these violet region of the sky will be moth- aspheric , grazing-incidence mirrors . 14 1 POPULAR SCIENCE  | unusual surface geometries to the precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions of the spectrum . " One for the birds The following is a true story : One of my acquaintances who is a physician got married last spring , and he and his bride enplaned for a honeymoon in China . Aboard the aircraft , he experienced some pain and pressure in one ear . He attributed it to a cold or allergy , which often produce such symptoms in pressurized plane cabins . To his dismay , however , the discomfort continued throughout the trip , even though he took a variety of decongestants and antihistamines . And it persisted on the long flight home . Back in New York , he finally decided to consult a friend who was an ear , nose , and throat specialist . In the examining room , the ENT man exclaimed , " No wonder , you 've got something lodged against your eardrum . " When the offending object was extracted , it turned out to be a speck of birdseed .

Air Force could increase not only the safety but the economy of military and commercial flights . It could provide continuous information on corrosion in aging planes and helicopters and curtail the need for expensive , labor- and time-intensive inspections and overhauls . The system , developed by Battelle , senses the onset and severity of corrosion by monitoring increases in the electrial resistivity of small metallic sensors mounted on airframe parts in hard-to-reach areas . Resistance in metal sensors increases as corrosion eats away at their cross-sectional thickness . " Moisture , salt , and dirt often accumulate in the crevices or pockets inherent to the design of most aircraft systems , " says Battelle project manager John Stropki .

Racing ceramics The silicon nitride ceramic valves in the photo on this page have enabled a stock car to achieve three wins and one third-place finish in four races by boosting engine power six to seven percent . They were designed by Robert Larsen , of Argonne National Laboratory , who founded the American Ceramic Engine Co. of Bolingbrook , Ill. , the first U.S. firm to produce and market all-ceramic components for racing engines . The winning car is a Chevrolet Camaro . Loaded with a 355-cubic-inch engine , 16 ceramic valves , a single fourbarrel carburetor , and a 9:1 compression ratio , the Camaro develops about 500 horsepower . It set an all-time track record last February at the 23rd annual World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing held in New Smyrna Beach , Fla .

Of course you recognize that string of numbers . It 's pi , the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter . And of course you also know that the string is not only incomplete , but can never , by definition , be complete , for pi is a transcendental number with an infinite number of digits . And you are probably aware that people keep calculating pi to ever greater lengths , not merely as an exercise , but with benefits for computer science and several branches of mathematics . The latest achievement by two Columbia University mathematicians is to extend pi to 480 million decimal places , more than doubling a 1988 record of 201 million decimal places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V. and David V , using a new algorithm , or sequence of computer instructions , that for the first time permits checking the accuracy of the calculation at every step , and growing the number from its middle or its end . Unlike previous calculations of pi , which were run and checked on the same supercomputer employing slightly different methods , the Chudnosvskys ' chore was carried out independently on two supercomputers with entirely different architecture and software . They were an IBM 3090 at the IBM Research Center at Yorktown Heights , N.Y. , and a Cray II at the Minnesota Supercomputer Center . I would happily reproduce the result here , but it would be 600 miles long and would fill a stack of computer sheets 30 feet high . 16 I POPULAR SCIENCE
