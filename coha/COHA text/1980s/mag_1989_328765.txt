Come summertime , there are two kinds of water people . There are the swimmers , surfers , scullers and sailors , who take to the sea under their own power or at the wind 's mercy . And then there are those who harness horsepower , turn a key and roar across the waves . The naval battles between the two types have gone on for years , as sailboats topple in the wakes of motorboats . But this year the most visible  --  and audible  --  combatant promises to be one of the smallest and peskiest of them all : the " personal watercraft , " better known by Kawasaki 's trademark Jet Skis . " Everyone I know has had at least one close call , " says board sailor Barbara Glunn in Miami . " And it usually happened when one guy tried to beat the antics of another . " <P> The skis are small , engine-driven craft that scoot across the water . Like their landbound cousins , motorcycles and snowmobiles , they are quick , maneuverable , noisy and a rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reach speeds of 40 m.p.h . Sales are believed to have doubled since 1984 , and there are now over 200,000 personal watercraft in use from coast to coast . <P> " I think a majority of the people who do n't ride ' em hate ' em , " observes Hawaii 's state boating manager , David Parsons . This summer that majority is likely to be more hostile than ever . Opponents view the scooters as an intrusive and dangerous presence on waterways . They point to the gruesome accidents and deaths that have resulted from hotdogging skiers who use swimmers as a slalom course . In Hawaii a six-year-old skier collided with a woman kayaker ; the woman died . In Arizona a baby girl sitting at the shoreline was washed along the rocks when a skier sent his wake crashing her way ; she required 130 stitches . On Easter Sunday at Miami 's Hobie Cat Beach , a nine- year-old boy was caught in the path of a water-scooter race ; he died the next day . The skiers themselves suffer many of the injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit a seawall . <P> Many resort-area residents also complain of the noise and nuisance of thoughtless riders who buzz fishermen , menace rowboats and rip through the quiet of mountain lakes and peaceful beaches . As a result , several states and localities have passed legislation in recent years regulating where and by whom the motorized skis may be used . Many have set the minimum age for riders at 14 , require use of a life jacket and forbid riding at night . In Florida , where eleven deaths have occurred since 1987 , the state plans to outlaw such reckless maneuvers as weaving through powerboat traffic . Local authorities in Arizona and Oregon have restricted the use of personal watercraft to designated areas on certain lakes . New Hampshire has banned the craft entirely from all lakes and ponds of less than 75 acres , and last week restricted the craft , with some exceptions , from coming within 300 ft. of the shoreline . <P> The laws and negative publicity have prompted the watercraft industry to expand its safety campaign . Industry spokesmen maintain that the machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Many people who are buying personal watercraft are buying their first boat , " says Catherine Martin , spokeswoman for the International Jet Ski Boating Association . " They 'll break some of the laws that other boaters are aware of without even knowing that they 're alienating anybody . "
