 | Seven-year-old Russell Baptist is sitting on the lawn in front of the housing complex where he lives ? but why is n't he wiping away the tears that are rolling down his cheeks ? Come a little closer and see that the tears are mingling with blue felt-tip pen markings drawn on the child 's face . Look at his nose , covered by a cardboard snout , fashioned crudely from an egg carton . And now , notice his hands , tied behind him to a chair . Join the cluster of a dozen or so neighbors who have gathered to gape , and read the hand-lettered sign Russell 's mother has attached to his chest : " I 'm a dumb pig . Ugly is what you will become every time you lie and steal . . . My hands are tied because I can not be trusted . This is a lesson to be learned . Look . Laugh . Thief . Stealing . Bad boy . " This pathetic scene , played out last summer in Hayward , Calif. , was a clearcut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mean the boy 's mother is unfit ? That question is being addressed in Alameda County Superior Court , where Russell 's mother , Mary Bergamasco , is currently facing the possibility of losing custody of her son . She claims she chose the pig punishment as a last resort , after trying other measures . Russell , she says , had stolen some baseball cards , $6 in cash , a belt buckle and another child 's toy , and then he denied it all . Bergamasco 's attorney , the flamboyant Melvin Belli , contends that " she 's a good mother who loves her children ... God knows we all make mistakes . " Many child-development researchers believe that the kind of punishment Bergamasco is charged with meting out is just as harmful as a beating and can leave scars on a child 's self-esteem that last much longer . " What this mother did was abusive . It was humiliating , it was embarrassing , it was degrading , " declares Anne Cohn , executive director of the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heinous form of child abuse , " says Cohn . " Broken bones mend themselves . Broken spirits do n't very easily . " About 250,000 cases of emotional abuse of children are reported annually , but the real incidence is probably much higher , according to NCPCA . The term includes a range of behavior , from neglect and rejec- tion to deliberate cruelty and humiliation . Many experts believe that very harsh or degrading punishments for misbehavior also constitute emotional abuse ? even if they are administered by parents or teachers who simply hope to make youngsters toe the line . Within the family , the pattern of emotional abuse is usually passed down from one generation to the next . " When you become a parent , unless you 've had some other input , you go with what you know , " says James Garbarino , president of the Erikson Institute for Advanced Study of Child Development and author of " The Psychologically Battered Child . " Parents whose lives are full of stresses , including unemployment , alcohol or drug abuse , and social isolation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Bergamasco , 29 , is no stranger to family problems . Her life has not been a soft one . The punishment she delivered to Russell , she explains , was one her own mother administered to her when she also stole as a child . In addition , she claims , her mother burned her hands as an extra " lesson . " When she was 15 , she dropped out of high school ( she has since earned an equivalency diploma ) , and her parents divorced . Almost immediately she married and had her first child , Christina . Then , in the middle of one night when . Christina was two , Bergamasco 's threemonth-old son died after suffering a broken back and fractured skull . Her husband reportedly pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and served three years in jail . " He broke my baby in two like a stick , " Bergamasco declares . She never married Russell 's father , or a third man , who fathered her one-year-old daughter , Jennifer . Last August , however , she did marry another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare since the age of 21 . Crazy idea : Emotional abuse is n't always rooted in the soil of poverty . Many parents are simply unfamiliar with any other method of discipline , often believing they are OK as long as they do n't hit their kids . They are not : experts say that belittlement , denigration and other forms of verbal assault on children are not only cruel but also ineffective ways to teach good behavior . " Where did we get the crazy idea that in order to make children do better . first you have to make them feel worse ? " asks Jane Nelsen , a family , child and marriage counselor in Sacramento , the mother of seven and author of " Positive Discipline . " Even in angry moments , it 's important for parents to avoid using epithets like " jerk , " " freak , " " idiot , " " worthless " or " stupid " when addressing their children , notes Garbarino . Also on the list of no-no 's , says Nancy Samalin , founder and director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child is Not Enough , " are the " red flag " words , " always " ( " you always bug me " ) and " never " ( " you 'll never amount to anything " ) . Among the " mild " punishments that child experts find help-  | ful are : temporarily restricting privileges , sending a misbehaving child out of the room , and exposing him or her to the " logical " consequences of a transgression . A child who steals , for instance , might be made to return the stolen item . Carrying out discipline effectively is a balancing act . Parents need to treat children with love and respect but make clear that they are the ones who have the final say in setting limits . " Parents can be quite strict without crushing the child 's spirit , " says child-rearing guru Dr. Benjamin Spock , 85 . " What is not good is to be strict out of hostility . I do n't believe in physical punishment or cruelty , " he adds , " and it sounds as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have children internalize limits and boundaries set by parents , says Lilian Katz , professor of early-childhood education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . Whenever possible , it 's best to dole out discipline quickly , but not if the parent is in a feverish state of anger . Consistency , says Garbarino , is also important ? from one parent to another , one incident to another , one child to another ? " because a lot of what child development is about is kids developing maps of what to expect from the world . " Rage and regret : Even with the best intentions , parents can expect to feel a certain amount of rage toward their youngsters , says family counselor Samalin . And even the most loving parents occasionally fly off the handle . " Sometimes it seems as if the experts do n't entirely understand what it 's like to be at home with kids , " observes Daisy Edmondson , who quit her job as an editor at Parents Magazine to be a full-time mother . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's later regretted . " Mary Bergamasco definitely regrets the notoriety her bizarre punishment of Russell has attracted . In court last week , the boy testified that he loves his mother but wants to live with his father , who he said had never embarrassed him and would teach him to water-ski . This trial , which will determine Russell 's immediate custody , is expected to conclude this week . Additional trials on charges of misdemeanor child abuse and the custody of Bergamasco 's infant daughter may follow . The case has made her hard life harder still . Her welfare payments were cut off when Russell and Jennifer were placed in temporary foster custody after the pig episode , and she is currently unemployed . " Who would hire me ? " she asks bitterly . " I 'm a big joke . I 'm the pig lady . " For Halloween , she says , in a weak attempt at levity , perhaps she 'll dress up as the Big Bad Wolf . 50 NEWSWEEK .
