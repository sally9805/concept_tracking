Earthquakes are so common in California that many of them are hardly noticed . But this month five sizable quakes in Southern and Central California have shaken residents , demolished mobile homes and split open at least one road , creating a whole new canyon while startled vacationers watched . Last week 's tremor near Bishop registered 6.1 on the Richter scale , a good rumble , and caused unusual concern because it followed so closely after the others . <P> Do the tremors portend the " big one " that Californians have feared for decades ? No , say experts . Robert Uhrhammer of the University of California seismographic station in Berkeley called the succession of earthquakes " pure coincidence . " Said he : " There is no evidence that other earthquakes are any more likely now than at any other time . "
