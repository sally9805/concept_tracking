The life-style of the idle rich titillates most of us . But the busy rich are , in truth , far more interesting . Here is Malcolm Forbes , surely one of the richest of men and very likely the busiest , and what he does with his money is endlessly fascinating and , in a way , almost endearing . At least it has proved to be such to kings and presidents and prime ministers and ordinary folk all over the planet . // Forbes , the 66-year-old owner and editor-in-chief of Forbes magazine , keeps turning up on the world 's front pages : riding his Harley Classic 80 up to Moscow 's Red Square as leader of the first group of foreigners permitted to tour the country by motorcycle , unfurling his 74-foot hot-air balloon alongside the Great Wall of China , another historic first , or leading his team of bikers triumphantly into Beijing . Now he has put together a handsome book celebrating his exploits . Around the World on Hot Air and Two Wheels ( Simon &amp; Schuster ) is priced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forbes 's principal home is in Far Hills , N.J. He also touches down for sporting weekends at an immense chateau in Normandy , not far from Omaha Beach , where he foots the bill for an annual international balloon fest ; a palace in Morocco that overlooks Tangier harbor ; a house in London ; a few " ranches " in the States ; and a Fiji island  --  reaching these destinations in his private Boeing 727 or his yacht . The properties  --  plus the boat , the bikes , the balloons , the plane  --  are not just for show ; they are used . // As Forbes told a Playboy interviewer , he got into cycling at 48 : " One of the guys who worked for me , a chauffeur , a neat guy , wanted to buy a motorcycle and asked if he could borrow the money .... Being a sensible man , I tried to talk him out of it . But he bought one anyway and he gave me a ride one day , and the next thing I knew , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A chauffeur was also involved in Forbes 's ballooning debut . While being driven to work in New York one morning , Forbes recalled reading that a local man was selling balloon rides . It seemed like fun : " I asked my driver if he 'd like to stop for an hour and go for a balloon ride . He said that sounded like a good idea , so we floated around the countryside for an hour and I was in the office by eight-thirty . " He was also hooked on ballooning . " On a motorcycle , " Forbes continues , " you sense that not everybody is happy to see you and your mode of transportation going by , but a balloon turns everybody on .... With a balloon , getting there is n't half the fun ; it 's all the fun . " // Soon Forbes was setting world records for hot-air ballooning . In 1973 , achieving a considerable logistical triumph , he set one of aeronautical history 's significant firsts , a coast-to-coast crossing ( from Coos Bay , Ore . to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the same balloon . He floated some 3,000 miles in 141 hours over 34 days , finishing a solid surface of black-and-blue bruises , not only from his Chesapeake splashdown but also from slamming around a cramped " basket " filled with propane tanks . Then he really got serious . After losing upward of a million dollars on the arrangements for a nonstop balloon crossing of both the U.S. and the Atlantic  --  it was aborted literally as the craft got off the ground  --  Forbes began combining his twin loves of biking and ballooning into a sort of worldwide goodwill ambassadorship that has enhanced his fame at home and abroad . // Forbes wisely invited professional journalists on nearly all his trips ; they 've done most of the writing and they 've done a good job . One silly flaw should have been avoided : Some of the book 's pages look as though they had been laid out by the same fellow who used to put together high school yearbooks in the 1930s . But do n't let that keep you from the pleasures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
