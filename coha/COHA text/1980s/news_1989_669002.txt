Gary Nei ' s confidence kept growing as a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration took evidence about Lyphomed Inc. ' s drug to fight AIDS-related pneumonia . As Lyphomed ' s recently named president , Nei was acutely aware that the drug , perhaps the most effective against pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , the most frequent cause of death for AIDS victims , was poised to bring needed income and prestige to the Rosemont-based drug manufacturer . At the hearing May 1 , FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young , who usually does not attend such events , gave an opening statement emphasizing the importance of the discussions . The panel was presented with two questions : whether to recommend approval of the drug in an aerosol form ( it was available in injectable form ) , and whether the drug sould be approved for use by AIDS victims who had not contracted the pneumonia . An FDA medical officer urged approval of the drug as a preventive step against the pneumonia , rather than only as a treatment for it . A gay man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network for clinical trials of aerosolized pentamidine , praised Lyphomed for developing the drug . Michael Callen , president of the Community Research Initiative , remarked that those trials were " paid for by a small pharmaceutical company ( Lyphomed ) in Illinois . " Lyphomed " has received a great deal of criticism from the AIDS activist community for the price increases which it claims were necessary to pay for this research , " Callen said . " I can not say whether their price has been justified , " he said , " but I can say that they were the first company to put their money down in a gamble on an experimental approach to AIDS treatment research . And I believe we ' ve all won that gamble . " The FDA advisory panel justified Nei ' s confidence , voting unanimously to recommend approval of the drug in aerosol form and as a preventive step . Before the vote , Lyphomed stock jumped $1. 25 a share , to $18. 87 , in over-the-counter trading . For Lyphomed , that day ' s events contrasted sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company had been vilified by some AIDS activists , who claimed that Lyphomed was profiteering at the expense of the afflicted by charging too much for injectable pentamidine , a major treatment for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia . More damaging to Lyphomed ' s bottom line , the FDA had complained about the company ' s quality-control procedures , temporarily banned distribution of some of the company ' s products and refused to look at its applications to develop or market new drugs . The result for the high-flying distributor of generic injectable drugs for hospitals had been lost customers , lost sales , lost image and lost shareholder value as the stock price plummeted to less than $10 from $30 . The stock was trading around $18. 50 last week . Last month , however , the company reported its first quarterly profit in a year as it sold products that the FDA had released in December from quarantine and resumed making many of the products halted by the FDA last year .

Those lines will be transferred to its plant in Grand Island , N.Y. Of the major hospital groups scared away from the company , all have reinstated Lyphomed as an approved vendor except University Hospital Consortium , a 48-member group based in Oakbrook Terrace . Key to all this has been establishment of a greatly improved relationship with the FDA . Lyphomed closed plants in Chicago and Orlando rather than incur the great cost of bringing them into compliance . " Their other main manufacturing facilities , in Melrose Park and Grand Island , are , for the most part , in compliance in all the major aspects , " said FDA spokesman Bradford Stone . Nei , who came to Lyphomed in November as president and chief operating officer , will become chief executive May 25 .

Nei and Kapoor spent most of last week in Japan , meeting with officials of Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals , which owns 30 percent of Lyphomed . Nei and Kapoor planned to outline to Fujisawa how Lyphomed , which under Kapoor had grown from selling $4 million of freeze-dried vitamins a year to sales of $173 million by 1987 , is transforming itself from a precocious child into an adult player in the sophisticated world of pharmaceutical development and marketing . They were to tell Fujisawa , for instance , about the company ' s three-year strategic plan , Nei said . " This is the first time Lyphomed has developed a long-range plan , " he said . " That ' s important to do as the company moves forward . We ' re not the small entrepreneurial company we were . " A main component of the plan is the separation of the company into two parts , one for generic drugs and the other for proprietary drugs , which tend to bring higher unit profits , Nei said . Injectable pentamidine , the company ' s first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million to $45 million of Lyphomed ' s $128 million in sales last year , says Bonnie Perkins , vice president and health care analyst for the investment firm Chicago Corp . She estimates sales of both forms of pentamidine will total $55 million this year and $85 million in 1990 . The company has a number of other drugs in the approval pipeline that the FDA reopened to it last fall . " On the multisource ( generic ) side , " Nei said , " we ' ll be talking about the rebuilding of production volumes in our plants and about a host of strategies to improve profitability . " In addition to competing on price , which the company has done aggressively , it plans to offer computer software for hospitals to use in scheduling personnel and managing drug inventories . The problems Lyphomed experienced with the FDA are by no means unique , says Michael Harshbarger , senior vice president of Hayes &; Griffith , a Chicago-based health care investment firm . " The fact that an FDA problem caused a major disruption in Lyphomed comes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Harshbarger said . Kapoor says Floyd Benjamin , hired as Lyphomed ' s vice president of scientific affairs , " played a very important role in getting us through , getting all the validations in place and keeping us in communication with the ( FDA ) . " " Floyd has had experience in the past , " Kapoor said . " He was at Abbott Laboratories when Abbott had problems ( with the FDA ) , and subsequent to that he went to McGaw Laboratories , a subsidiary of American Hospital Supply , and was instrumental in assaulting the problems McGaw had with the FDA in these situations . " Kapoor agrees that Lyphomed needed tighter organization . " Because of our rapid growth-we acquired Invenex Laboratories in 1985-we went from a one-plant to a three-plant operation . Invenex had its own procedures ; Lyphomed had its own . There was never an effort to put all these together . Everybody was devoting his efforts to supporting the growth .
