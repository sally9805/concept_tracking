Workers at one of Chrysler Corp. ' s most profitable plants have been on strike for five work days , and local union leaders will try to end the walkout tomorrow after failing to do so over the weekend . Analysts estimate that the work stoppage at the company ' s minivan factory near St. Louis is costing the auto maker as much as $4 million a day in lost profits . The 3 , 200 members of United Auto Workers union Local 110 walked off the job last Wednesday over the union ' s inability to negotiate with the company a new local agreement covering work rules , subcontracting and health and safety . The old contract expired Sept. 14 . Chrysler and the UAW negotiated a new national agreement covering wages , benefits and job security last spring . The expensive walkout comes after a year of tumultuous labor relations for the No. 3 auto maker . Chrysler touched off worker anger earlier this year with its plans to close its Kenosha , Wis. , assembly plant , and its abortive attempt to sell its parts-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of public relations blunders , and the final agreement was ratified by an unusually narrow margin . Throughout the summer , a number of Chrysler plants were hit with wildcat strikes over high temperatures . The strike also comes at a time of relative labor peace for the other major U.S. auto makers . Ford Motor Co. hasn ' t had a significant strike at a U.S. plant since August 1986 and General Motors Corp. hasn ' t had one since March 1987 . Local 110 leaders and plant management reached a tentative agreement on a new pact Friday night . But more than 60% of the workers voting opposed the contract , according to wire service reports . Local union leaders couldn ' t be reached yesterday to discuss why the vote failed or what they planned to do next . But a Chrysler spokesman said the union had scheduled another vote for tomorrow . He said the company didn ' t make any changes in the contract . " We have an agreement , " he said . " Ratification is a union matter . " The plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are among Chrysler ' s best-selling models . The factory has been running on nine-hour shifts , as well as many Saturdays , to try to keep up with demand . " We ' re completely sold out of those , so there ' s no chance to recover that production , " Robert S. Miller Jr . , Chrysler ' s vice chairman , said in an interview yesterday . " Tens of millions of dollars of revenue is going by the board . " Mr. Miller declined to estimate lost earnings . But Wendy Beale of Smith Barney , Harris Upham &; Co. said the strike is costing the company $3. 5 million a day in lost net income  --  or more than $17 million through yesterday . If workers approve the accord at the next vote , the soonest they could return to work would be Thursday . That would mean a loss of about $25 million . Before the strike , Ms. Beale estimated Chrysler would earn about $1. 03 billion for 1988 . Chrysler has also failed to reach agreements at two of its other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly plant and the Twinsburg , Ohio , stamping plant . The UAW hasn ' t authorized a strike at either factory , although Twinsburg workers have twice rejected the tentative agreement reached there .
