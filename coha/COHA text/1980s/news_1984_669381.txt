This is Stephan R. Leinberg ' s motto as he advises clients , students , colleagues - and his own parents - on strategies for wise financial management for the later years. // Contributing to the support of parents is one of the very basic long-term financial goals people have , along with educating children and planning for retirement , financial planners say. // Mr. Leinberg , professor of taxation and estate planning at the American College in Bryn Mawr , Pa. , recommends a number of specific steps people can take with their parents , not only to enable an estate to pass smoothly to heirs , but to enable people to get the most out of their assets while they can still enjoy them . Older people in comfortable circumstances , for example , can follow a ' ' gift-giving strategy ' ' that will give them a current income-tax deduction , rather than a post-mortem estate-tax deduction , and let them see the fruits of the charity as well. // Support of parents divides roughly into two categories : augmenting the retirement income of basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need arises. // For the first category , Dale Bizzi , a personal financial planner at State Street Bank &; Trust Company in Boston , recommends two income-shifting techniques more often associated with dependent children than with parents : Clifford trusts and interest-free loans . ' ' But they work very well for parents as well as children , ' ' she says. // A Clifford trust must be set up for 10 years and a day ; the income of the trust goes to the beneficiary - at his or her lower tax bracket - and the principal reverts to the donor at the end of the period. // ' There are not many ways to gift income for a term of years and have the principal return to you . This is an exception , ' ' Ms. Bizzi says. // Another way to support aged parents is the interest-free loan - although a recent Supreme Court case has put some new twists into this. // Here ' s how it works : A donor sets up a trust , funded with the loan of a demand note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beneficiary , presumably at a lower tax bracket. // The Supreme Court , however , recently found that by not charging interest the originator of an interest-free loan is making a gift , and if it exceeds the $10 , 000 per person per year limit on tax-free gifts , the donor must pay gift tax . ( Note that we are talking about the imputed interest on the loan itself , not about income earned by investing the lent sum. ) // It ' s not clear yet at what rate imputed interest should be calculated . One possibility is to link the rate to the Treasury-bill interest rate - or the rate the Internal Revenue Service uses for interest on late tax payments or late refunds. // Moreover , John T. Hayes , a tax partner with Arthur Young &; Co. in Chicago , points out that Congress is looking hard at the income-tax write-off aspect of the interest-free loan from the donor ' s point of view , ' ' So nobody ' s getting too excited about these things anymore. ' ' // Mr. Hayes recommends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater flexibility than the Clifford trust , and it works like this : The donor puts property in trust to benefit , say , his mother , for whatever length of time is desired ; when the trust terminates , the property goes to the donor ' s spouse . For people who have no qualms about putting property in their spouses ' names , this can be a useful technique. // Then there ' s one standby that is so obvious it may be overlooked , and that is simply giving money to your parents ; you and your spouse can each give $10 , 000 to each of your parents - or to anyone else , for that matter . There is no gift tax for the donor , and the recipient does not have to pay tax on the sum - although interest earned on it is taxable . ( Giving money away can also be a good way for an older person to simplify handling of his or her own estate. ) // So far we ' ve considered the first category of support we mentioned : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting the need for long-term health care ? // Hans Palmer , a Pomona College economist , differentiates between the problems of an ' ' acute-illness episode ' ' ( ' ' No picnic , but manageable ' ' ) , on one hand , and long-term illness , frailty , and general dependency , on the other , which can be financially devastating. // Like Mr. Leinberg , he beats the drum for planning ahead on the matter of caring for one ' s parents . Insisting that one ' s parents take proper care of their health is critical . Dr. Palmer urges adult children to ' ' sit down and talk with their folks as soon as they have established a certain degree of financial independence ' ' about what kind of provisions to make for long-term care if the parents need it . ' ' What we ' re looking for , frankly , is to reduce resource consumption . . . . There is a lot of affection within a family , . . . but the heir also has a legitimate interest in wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t want to be destroying the financial base of the younger generation. ' ' // Dr. Palmer advocates special health insurance for long-term illness , ' ' if they can get it , and if they can afford it . ' ' He also recommends a health maintenance organization - if the HMO will accept the older person ; many won ' t , at least not without a huge fee. // A particular problem is that medicare will not pay for nursing-home care if the stay in a nursing home is not preceded by a stay in a hospital. // One encouraging trend , he says , has been the experiments in allowing medicare - for which everyone over 65 is eligible - to pay the up-front fee for an HMO for seniors . This service is not widely available , however , and Dr. Palmer indicates that Washington is in no mood to do much more expanding of public health-care benefits . ' ' My hunch is that the feds are tightening up , and the states have been through such a wringer the last few years. ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ' ' spending down ' ' to qualify for medicaid which , unlike medicare , is available only to those meeting poverty criteria . Some older people have no choice but to spend down : They sell their house and liquidate other assets to pay for care . But others in effect give their money to their family so as to qualify for medicaid . This strategy does not always work , since some states consider resources of the entire immediate family when determining medicaid eligibility. // Philip Rogers , a lawyer with the New York firm of Ballon , Stoll &; Itzler , warns that under New York State law , ' ' It is improper to transfer funds to one ' s children to claim poverty . ' ' He also warns against making fraudulent statements on official forms when applying for medicaid ; he notes that penalties would be imposed upon the one directly filing a fraudulent claim , i. e. , the parent , but that a son or daughter who contributed false information would be liable as well. // The reverse annuity mortgage - or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for older parents who have more house than they need , all paid for free and clear . With a RAM , a lender lends the owner of a house some 60 to 80 percent of its appraised value ; this loan is not received as a lump sum but in regular monthly payments over a number of years - typically 10 to 20 . If the loan is not repaid when the time is up , the lender gets the house. // There are a number of difficulties with this arrangement , Dr. Palmer says , not least of which is that it is quite possible for the older parent to outlive the income stream . And that income stream is unlikely to be very big , he adds. // Sale-and-leaseback arrangements , whereby the house is sold and leased back to the owner , might be more attractive , says Dr. Palmer , but the tax status of these deals is not completely clear. // //
