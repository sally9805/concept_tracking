With dispatch , Navratilova repeats at Wimbledon <P> Billie Jean King , who will turn 40 before her next Wimbledon , or the next Wimbledon , is approximately eleven years older than Chris Evert Lloyd , who is approximately eleven years older than Andrea Jaeger . Besides representing a tidy chronology of women 's tennis , they were the forces marshaled this past fortnight on one flank of the Wimbledon draw , the side opposite Martina Navratilova , 26 , whose only point of reference lately is herself . In seven matches averaging just over three-quarters of an hour , Navratilova lost no sets and only 25 games , defeating Jaeger at the end for her fourth Wimbledon women 's singles title and second in a row . The opening set of the 6-0 , 6-3 final took 16 minutes . At one point Martina 's dress came undone ; everything else held together . " I was looking at the clock , " Jaeger admitted . " ' I better take my time on the changes , ' I thought . The match was going kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command now is that she can turn the No. 3 player in the world into a clock watcher . " I 'm not unbeatable , " Martina says , " but I 'm pretty difficult to beat . " <P> Evert Lloyd , who lost to Navratilova in last year 's final , fell to unseeded Kathy Jordan in this year 's third round , ending a stunning run of consistency unappreciated before and nearly unfathomable now . Counting every major tournament she ever entered-35 Wimbledons , U.S. Opens , French Opens and Australian Opens since 1971-this was the first time Evert Lloyd failed to reach the semifinals . " I never realized , " said Navratilova in hushed awe . For a year and a half Martina has been the best women 's tennis player ; for ten years Evert Lloyd has defined what that means . " It was always normal for me to live up to my seeding , " Chris says , without complaining , though there must be a particular hurt in having always to accomplish that much before ever accomplishing anything . " I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Though pale and plainly sick the day she lost , Evert Lloyd made little of that afterward . Since she holds the other three major titles at the moment , a grand slam , admittedly not the calendar one , was lost too . Still her grace in defeat was heroic , in contrast to the style of the defending men 's champion and top seed Jimmy Connors , who fled in a fury after his fourth-round loss to a big server from South Africa , twelfth-seeded Kevin Curren.
