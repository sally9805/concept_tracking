Although dealers are dismayed that higher interest rates in Japan will mean less Japanese buying of Treasury securities , the decline in American bond prices was a modest 1/2 point on Friday. // " I ' m just glad the Japanese rates went up before we begin bidding on a heavy supply of Treasury issues later this quarter , " said one American securities dealer , who asked not to be identified . <> <> Purchases of Treasury Issues // While the yen is rising , Japanese purchases of Treasury notes and bonds are likely to be slight , some traders concluded . But if Treasury bonds continue to offer yields that are four percentage points greater than Japanese bonds , they expect Japanese buyers to eventually return. // By encouraging higher short-term interest rates , analysts said , the Bank of Japan was putting more muscle behind its efforts to strengthen demand for the yen and help reduce the value of the dollar . But the Japanese central bank ' s push for higher short-term rates - which quickly spread to the long-term Japanese bond market - caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting lower short-term interest rates , on the theory that lower rates would help stimulate the Japanese economy , as was agreed Sept. 22 by officials from five major non-Communist industrial nations known as the Group of Five : the United States , West Germany , France , Britain and Japan. // " The authorities seem to have decided that , before stimulating the economy , there must be more appreciation in the yen , " said Akira Tokutomi , executive vice president at the Nikko Securities Company . <> <> Earlier 10% Rise in Value of Yen // Before the sharp ascent in Japanese rates , there was much speculation that the nearly 10 percent rise in the value of the yen since Sept. 22 would be enough to satisfy authorities in Japan and the United States . " But now the situation has changed , and you could expect another 5 to 7 percent appreciation in the yen , " Mr. Tokutomi estimated. // Although Treasury bond yields remain far higher than Japanese bond yields , the differential was substantially reduced when Japanese bond prices fell as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than three-fourths of a percentage point , in some cases , to 6. 35 percent . Repercussions were quickly felt in the Treasury bond market , where the 10 5/8 percent issue due in 2015 closed Friday at 101 1/2 , down about 3/4 point , to yield 10. 47 percent. // " Some differential between Treasury bond yields and Japanese bond yields will remain , but a narrower spread will discourage Japanese investment in Treasury bonds , " said Toshihide Mizuno , an economist at the New York branch of Sanwa Bank . But because the Bank of Japan has said there is no upper limit on short-term rates , Mr. Mizuno said he expects " a one or two percentage point increase in Japanese bond yields in the near future. " // Hidehiko Ide , a manager of financial institution relations at the New York agency of Fuji Bank noted that the upward movement in Japanese rates " is limited , because of the commitment to stimulate the Japanese economy " by the Group of Five . <> <> No Benefit Seen for Growth // " Maybe these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign exchange market , but I do not foresee any benefit for economic growth , " said another official at Fuji Bank , who asked not to be identified . Japanese economic activity is not likely to be hurt by a higher yen and higher interest rates over the balance of this year , " but next year could be worse , " he said. // On Friday , there were reports of some Japanese selling of Treasury bonds , particularly from the trading accounts of some banks . But the magnitude of the decline in Treasury issues - only 1/2 point - plus the comments of government securities dealers suggests there was no wholesale dumping of Treasury issues by the Japanese institutions that have been major buyers this year. // One reason for the modest reaction in the American market is speculation that the Federal Reserve might soon encourage lower interest rates. // " The second step to reducing Japanese capital outflow is for the U.S. to try to lower interest rates , " said Mr. Mizuno of the Sanwa Bank . " The U.S. economy is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by historical standards . " Real interest rates are the level of nominal rates minus the rate of inflation. // Some analysts said the Fed might encourage lower interest rates if negative money supply growth in October is followed by slow money supply growth in November and weak economic statistics.  --   --  Yen Bond Futures TOKYO , Monday , Oct. 28 ( Reuters ) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced today that it had increased the daily price limit for yen bond futures to three points , from one , because of the recent steep fall in prices on both futures and cash bond markets. // The futures market is losing its function as a hedging market because cash bond prices have been falling much faster than the bond futures prices whose move is limited , exchange officials said . The expansion of the limit has become necessary for the futures market to catch up to the cash bond price fall , they said. // The current December position dropped the limit of one full point for two consecutive days last Friday and Saturday to close at 99. 63 on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points in the same period , bond dealers said. // The yield of the key 6. 8 percent 68th 10-year Government bond rose to a high of 6. 70 percent at one point last Saturday before ending at 6. 30 against a 6. 20 close on Friday . The yield started rising this morning with one 6. 48 percent quote , dealers said. // Short-term yen interest rates also soared further to near five-year highs , with commercial bill discount rates jumping another 1/4 of a point , to 7. 8125 percent , after a 1/2-point rise last Saturday , money brokers said . The upswing is due to the apparent upward guidance of short-term rates since last Thursday by the Bank of Japan to help boost the yen value against the dollar , they said. // The sudden drop in cash and futures bond prices is due to the Bank of Japan ' s upward guidance of short-term yen interest rates to promote the yen against the dollar , dealers said. // The dollar opened at 213. 60 yen against its 214. 90 close here on Friday and then fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers said . The Bank of Japan sold a moderate amount of dollars for yen at around 213. 85 yen to prevent the dollar from rising above 214 yen , dealers said. //
