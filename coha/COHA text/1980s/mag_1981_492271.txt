THE FLOWERING OF GEORGE BUSH George Bush , a Yankee Brahmin with a slight Texas accent , is succeeding famously as vice president because he has followed that maxim of traditional politics , " To get along , go along . " Bush enjoys a warm friendship with President Reagan , surprising some of Reagan 's ardent followers , and has proven to be a solid team player . Moreover , the President , in tandem with Bush , has enlarged the role and elevated the status of the Office of Vice President  --  an action pioneered by President Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale . This move , executed in the new administration 's first weeks , heightened the confidence the two men hold for each other . While Bush had known Reagan many years as a politician , he did not know him as a man . Nor did Reagan really know Bush . Once in office , Reagan quickly discovered that Bush is cooperative and loyal . And Bush learned what many other " outsiders " have  --  that Ronald Reagan is warm , good-natured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought I knew where he was coming from , but I did n't know him , " Bush related in an interview . " I have great respect for him personally . He 's got humor , kindness and commitment to principle . He 's a very easy man to work with . He encourages you to speak up , and he can make decisions and be firm . He has a way of bringing the best out of people . " One quick result of Bush 's happy situation is that he has become more palatable politically . Conservatives who once dubbed him " liberal " ( which his record disproves ) now agree he is doing a first rate job and serving the President well . There is a residue of skepticism from some on the right , but it is muted for the moment . Given the President 's age , talk about Bush heading the 1984 ticket is natural , though the Vice President makes it a strictly verboten subject for his staff . Bush is aptly called " the handyman of American politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has been a U.S. congressman ; United Nations Ambassador ; Chief of the U.S. Office in Peking ; Republican National Committee Chairman ; Director of Central Intelligence ; unsuccessful presidential candidate ; and now , vice president . " All his jobs seemed like stinkers at the time , " said Chase Untermeyer , Bush 's young executive assistant and a fellow Texan . " But he took full advantage of them , and by making the best of it , benefited politically . He thinks being vice president is an excellent job , and he has ' Bushian ' enthusiasm for it . " March 30 , 1981 , is historic because of the attempted assassination of President Reagan . But it was also the day when the groundwork laid by Reagan for Bush to function in his place paid off . Bush 's plane was rolling for takeoff on the runway at Fort Worth , Texas , enroute to his next speaking date in Austin , when Secret Service Agent Ed Pollard got word by radio of the shooting . He passed the news as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message came from Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig for Bush to return to Washington . Bush and his staff watched the unfolding horror on a television set in the airborne Air Force I , but he did not see the part where Haig suddenly appeared , nervous and breathless , to announce he was in control and was in touch with the Vice President . After awhile , Bush went to his forward cabin and asked Untermeyer , the " journal keeper , " to take down his thoughts , because he believed it might be a valuable record one day . " In doing this , " Untermeyer said , " I asked him how he heard the news of the shooting , and he answered that he had no memory of it at all . The detail was lost . " His reaction was not that of a vice president learning that the president had been shot . His reaction was that a friend , Ronald Reagan , was smiling one moment on TV and suddenly was cut down . " The Vice President , according to Untermeyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's life was n't in danger because of Reagan 's excellent health and the report that he had walked into the hospital . " On that day and on that flight , " Untermeyer said , " Bush never felt any imminent possibility that he might have to take over as president . " The Secret Service and the military wanted Bush to arrive in Washington on the White House south lawn  --  for security reasons . Bush turned the recommendation away and ordered the helicopter to land on the pad near the vice president 's mansion . " Bush said the White House lawn is where presidents land , not vice presidents , " Untermeyer said . " Besides , he thought the noise would bother Nancy Reagan , already under great stress . " Bush 's decision on the helicopter landing expressed a symbolic significance that carried him through the period of Reagan 's convalescence . Bush presided over White House staff and national security meetings , but he consciously did so not in the Oval Office but his own . Similarly , he presided over cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a decision , but not giving any impression he was making the decision . " Everything went smoothly , " Bush later said , " because the President had laid the groundwork . There was nothing in writing about how to operate , but he had established the framework and machinery , and it worked effectively . " It was a judgmental call for me on some occasions . I did n't want to make it appear as though I was making presidential decisions , although I did have a substantial role . The President was available for decisions , if necessary . His signing the milk bill only a day after he was in the hospital was a tiny thing , but it demonstrated that the President was going forward . " While President Reagan was recuperating , his staff worked for Bush as though it always had . Young activists who , one year ago , made faces during the primary season over Bush ( because they were campaigning for Reagan or Philip Crane ) developed a new-found respect . And the President 's closest circle  --  Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked with Bush as though he were a brother . This performance demonstrated one great difference between the Ford White House with its Rockefeller vice presidency and the Reagan-Bush combinationthat where Ford 's staff and Rockefeller 's quarreled shamefully , the staffs of Reagan and Bush work together well . Reagan , after being nominated in Detroit last July , was n't sure he wanted Bush for his running mate ; after all , Gerald Ford was his first choice . But Republican insiders who had worked with Bush , as well as some of Reagan 's closest advisors , told Reagan that if George Bush was anything , he was a team man . Convinced , Reagan , who insists on the team approach to management , asked Bush to run with him . The two men did n't see each other that much during the fall campaign . The presidential candidate goes cne way and his running mate the other in that strenuous effort . Nor did they see each other often during the transition period , because Reagan spent virtually all his time at his ranch while Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inauguration , Reagan and Bush worked out the mode by which Bush would serve as vice president . Interestingly enough , it is modeled in large part after the Democratic team they campaigned so hard against and defeated  --  Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale . All through American history , estimable men uttered doleful pronouncements about the vice presidency . Benjamin Franklin titled the office " His Superfluous Excellency . " Daniel Webster rejected it , saying , " No thank you . I do not propose to be buried until I am really dead and in my coffin . " Harry Truman said vice presidents " were about as useful as a cow 's fifth teat . " Ultimately , Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , pompously declared , " There is no escape , it seems to me , from the conclusion that the vice presidency is not only a meaningless but a hopeless office . " Small wonder that in our time incoming presidents promised to reform this office and announced how their vice president would perform important duties . Yet inevitably , vice presidents were shunted off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit and assigned to nebulous duties as liaison to the space program . " Neither Mondale nor Bush wanted to be sent out into space , " one White House staffer stated . " The vice president 's job has become something in the past five years . " In the transition , Mondale hosted Bush in a long lunch and told him about the arrangements he had made with President-elect Carter four years before . Mondale recommended to Carter that the vice president be a general advisor , be privy to all secret infor mation , attend all meetings of advisory groups , have access to all papers crossing the president 's desk and have a standing invitation to all subcommittee meetings of the National Security Council . ( By law , the vice president attends NSC meetings , but much of the important work is done in subcommittee . ) Carter bought it all and , on his own , gave Mondale an office in the White House  --  an historic first . The consequence of his unprecedented arrangement was that when Mondale traveled abroad , he was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He worked closely with the Secretary of State so as not to compete with him . It was the same when Mondale traveled in America ; he had clout when he visited governors and mayors . Partly because Carter was a greenhorn to the federal government and partly because the notion of an effective vice president was an idea whose time had come , Mondale established a precedent that seems destined to last  --  and to make a monkey out of Arthur Schlesinger . " I could n't have played that role , " Mondale said one afternoon , " unless I had the President 's complete confidence . If I disagreed with other advisors or even the President on something serious , I 'd always make my argument alone , in private , with him . I did n't want , to be in a position where these things were reported , where he could n't talk to me in candor and might have to read about it in the paper . " To be effective , you have to be willing not to get public credit . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support something , I just told him I did n't want to talk about it . He never pressed me to do it . " Looking back on the arrangement , I did n't ask myself why it had succeeded , but why had n't it happened so much earlier ? The president has so much to do , this country has so much work to do  --  to waste that office is an abomination . We ca n't afford it . " While Reagan-Bush disagreed strongly in the campaign with about everything espoused by Carter-Mondale , it is apparent these four Americans shared similar notions about what the vice presidency should be . Bush has all the prerogatives Mondale enjoyed . All Bush will say about it is , " Mon-dale and Carter charted the new ground . We built upon it . " Bush , the quick heir to the Mondale legacy , arrives in his office in the Executive Office Building about ' 7:30 each morning , meets with Nancy Bearg Dyke , his national security advisor , while his chief of staff , Daniel J. Murphy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bush eats a bowl of cold cereal , drinks coffee and goes over important mail . By mid-morning , he 's in what Untermeyer calls " Mondale 's beachhead , " the vice presidential office in the White House . It is located in a busy place , with a xerox machine outside the door and people rushing around those quarters , cramped when measured against the spacious areas in the EOB . Mondale called the EOB " Baltimore , " meaning that since it was a five-minute walk away , it might as well be five hours away psychologically , because it was n't near the President . Bush sits in on White House staff meetings and attends the daily NSC briefing . " He is not shy at all about offering comments , thoughts or suggestions , " Murphy said . " As far as the federal government is concerned , he is the most experienced person in the administration . But he 's not at all up front at these meetings , and that 's on purpose . George picks up nuances and points of view from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is invaluable information to pass on to the President before he sees a head of state . The President is grateful for this and so is Secretary Haig . " On Tuesdays , by custom , Bush presides over the Senate . He meets with the Republican leadership , an accepted practice . But Bush also sits in on the Republican Policy Committee meetings , an unusual practice . Years ago , when Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson , a former Senate Majority Leader , tried to sit in on Senate Democratic caucus meetings , he was politely but firmly informed that the meeting was for senators only . Mondale was mindful of the cold reception LBJ got , so he rarely went to such policy meetings . Evidently Bush 's time as GOP national chairman during the ordeal of Watergate won him credentials with Republicans who are now in the Senate . Once Bush is parked in his White House office , it is unlikely he 'll head back to the EOB . He does spend more time at EOB than Mondale did and holds his staff meetings there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , and he does n't avoid the rounds of appointments laid out for him every day . For a while , he took time to jog on the Chesapeake Canal towpath , but Secret Service men decided that narrow runway was n't the best from a security standpoint . So Bush now jogs in the safer confines of a nearby army base . He also plays tennis and mixes games of paddle ball in the Senate or House gym with a measure of congressional relations . When Bush was a presidential candidate , some opponents scoffed that " George runs on his r  --  sum ? , " meaning that his varied career made him a jack-of-all-trades but light in all of them . Actually , the experience he had in a dozen fields is serving him well in the vice presidency . As a businessman for 17 years . Bush became fed up with federal regulations . As a congressman for two terms , that feeling was compounded . He did n't lose touch with the federal snaggle when he served in other top government jobs . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force set up by the President . With a staff headed by C. Boyden Gray , Bush 's counsel , and James C. Miller , a regulatory expert serving in the Office of Management and Budget , Bush 's charter is to make the task force operational and not just a study group . Murphy claims there was substantial progress in doing away with many regulations by early summer , but the success of this effort can be better measured by 1982 . Bush also had the responsibility for pulling together the experts in various departments for the Ottawa summit , where Western nations discussed world economic problems . Bush made sure that the President 's concerns got onto the agenda for this meeting . While national economic policy ca n't be set at such a meeting , there is a great venting of common economic problems , and that 's why the Ottawa meeting was important . The Vice President 's experience as U.N . Ambassador , Chief of Mission in Peking and as CIA Director , came in handy as he prepared the U.S. government for the Ottawa summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis as well . " So many of the people I met at the U.N . now crop up in our lives , " Bush said . " The Jamaican ambassador was a good personal friend of mine at the U.N . There are a number of African leaders whom I knew at the U.N . If you know somebody , it relaxes the environment . It 's not a matter of the vice president out there negotiating or making foreign policy . It 's just being able to meet them on a personal basis . " Bush 's foreign affairs and CIA experience helped President Reagan decide to place the Vice President in charge of " crisis management , " a designation which rankled Secretary of State Haig . But in the style of the Reagan presidency , the matter was smoothed out by the President and his troika  --  Meese , Baker and Deaver . Bush and Haig also had conversations , described as cordial and constructive . At any rate , all Bush said about the episode was : " As far as 1 am concerned , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One way you keep it under control is not to discuss it . The relationship between Secretary Haig and myself is working very well . " Bush is not one to get into a power struggle or political bind . He is ex perienced in the art of politics . As national chairman and in his relentless two-year run for the presidency , Bush met all manner of Republicans . Bush is like a Mondale or a Hubert Humphrey or , for that matter , a Ronald Reagan in knowing the political landscape . Where Mondale was Carter 's best and perhaps only man in White House relations with Congress , the new administration does n't have to rely solely on its vice president . Reagan has shown deftness in dealing with Congress , is n't bashful in having key leaders down to the White House for some " by golly " treatment and has earned good marks for working his will . Still , Bush knows many congressmen who have been around since he left that body in 1971 , and senators are aware that his father , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut from 1952 to 1962 . Nearly all Bush 's rhetoric these days is conservative support of the President 's programs and expressions of loyalty to Reagan . When he spoke at a huge testimonial dinner for Daniel Mahoney , one of the founders of New York 's Conservative Party  --  once the bane of regular Republicans but now sought after  --  Bush spoke glowingly of how , " Last November , we harvested a great victory for conservatism and the cause of freedom . " Bush 's able performance as vice president and his strong loyalty to Reagan have won him the support of the President 's inner circle , including the nominally skeptical Lyn Nofziger , political doorkeeper for the President . " You never have to worry about the Vice President , " Nofziger said . " He is totally loyal . He will never say or do anything that in any way hurts the relationship with the President or the White House . " Sen. Barry Goldwater is also a Bush fan . " There is n't any real opposition to him from conservatives , " stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 've seen in my lifetime . " Nofziger and Goldwater are Republican team-players . The New Right political force is not , and Richard Viguerie , the New Right 's celebrated prophet , remains skeptical of Bush . " I strongly opposed him being picked for the vice presidency , " Viguerie said . " Bush is a traditional , middle-of-the-road Republican , someone who would be basically in favor of continuing government pretty much as it is  --  favoring established programs by giving them budget increases every year the way Nixon and Ford did . " " He 's done what Reagan asked him to do , " said Viguerie , " so he 's a good vice president . That does n't mean he would be a good president . Bush has n't changed his views . He 's moderate , mainstream , for big government and big business . " Bush is no dummy . He 's not going to make moderate- or liberal-sounding speeches like Rockefeller or Howard Baker . Someday Bush wants to go before the Republican Party which is becoming more conservative by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait Bush out and , if he runs for president , pounce on him . But Reagan by picking him , the White House power circle by including him , most conservatives by praising him and the public by liking him demonstrate that George Herbert Walker Bush . born in Milton . Massachusetts , June 12 , 1924 , is no fluke as vice president . The four parts to his name indicate his old-line Yankee heritage . His high-timbered accent betrays the Ivy League and his family of banking and the U.S. Senate . Bush is as conservative as the run of Reagan cabinet people , but his pin-striped tie and Eastern look cause outlanders to regard him as a " moderate ' . or , worse , a He graduated from Phillips Academy , enlisted in the navy in 1942 and , at age 18 , was the youngest commissioned navy pilot of that time . He flew combat missions in the Pacific , was shot down and rescued by an American sub in the nick of time and won a fistful of medals . At Yale , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseman , captained the varsity baseball team . After graduation in 1948 , he put the possibility of an Eastern banking career aside , went west to Texas where he swept floors in his first job , learned the oil business , borrowed from his family and cofounded Zapata Offshore Company , which pioneered in experimental offshore drilling equipment . He made millions . He had married a strong , pleasant woman , Barbara Pierce of Rye , New York  --  thus from his background  --  and she was sturdy enough to be cheerful about their first home in Texas . It was a trailer next door to a prostitute with whom they shared the same bathroom . The Bushes have five children , ranging in age from 20 to 33 . The second eldest . Jeb , 26. is married to a Mexican-American , and he and his wife have children . Thus Bush is the first top officer of government to have HispanicAmerican grandchildren , and this fact did n't hurt him in Spanish-speaking precincts in 1980 . But do not forget that George Bush serves on the vestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buoyant personality , Bush became active in Republican politics . In 1964 , an extraordinarily poor year for Republicans in Texas . Bush ran for the U.S. Senate , finishing far ahead of the Goldwater ticket but behind Democratic incumbent Ralph Yarborough , who got 56.5 percent of the vote . In 1966 , Bush became the first Republican to be elected to Congress in Texas since the reconstruction , winning 57.1 percent of the vote in a suburban Houston district . Two years later , he ran without opposition . Bush tried for the Senate again in 1970 , and had such diverse support as President Nixon , Vice President Spiro Agnew ( both gave speeches for him ) and inveterate liberals John Kenneth Galbraith and former Sen. Ernest Gruening ( both opposed to Lloyd Bentsen , Bush 's opponent ) . Bush was given an even chance to win , but lost , partly because a referendum vote on local option liquor sales drew a heavy turnout of teetotaling , Bible-minded Democrats from rural areas . Now twice a fallen warrior in Senatorial campaigns , Bush was given consolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked that job . However , Bush 's credentials as a team-player were put to the test in January , 1973 , when President Nixon put the arm on him to take over the Republican National Committee . Bush had no idea then that he was walking into hell . Watergate grew like a mushroom and soon became a malignancy . Bush had to defend Nixon , Republicanism and the two-party system . He remained loyal to all , earning wide applause . When Nixon , Haig and Kissinger were huddled in the bunker at the end , with heavy artillery pounding relentlessly from Congress , George Bush , a follower and friend of Nixon 's , painfully wrote this letter : " It is my considered judgment that you should now resign . I expect in your lonely embattled position this would seem to you as an act of disloyalty from one you have supported and helped in so many ways . My own view is that I would now ill serve a president . whose massive accomplishments I will always respect and whose family I love , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resignation has been no answer at all , but given the impact of the latest development , and it will be a lasting one , I now firmly feel resignation is best for this country , best for this president . I believe this view is held by most Republican leaders across the country . This letter is much more difficult because of the gratitude I will always have for you . If you do leave office , history will properly record your achievements with a lasting respect . " It was hard for any Republican regular to fault this assessment and the loyalty going with it . And so President Ford sent Bush to Peking as American envoy , an assignment that gave him time to play tennis , catch up on his reading and think . Then , when the going.got tough for the CIA , Bush was brought home in late 1975 to succeed William E. Colby , who had been fired as director . While approving the move to stop covert actions against U.S. citizens , Bush vainly resisted the congressional campaign to clamp down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the CIA job , thereby demonstrating bipartisanship , but appointed a friend , Admiral Stansfield Turner . It was n't long thereafter that Bush began running for president . In 1978 , he toured 42 states , laying down the nourishment at grass roots he hoped would sprout for him in 1980 . They sprouted mightily in Iowa , where he upset Reagan  --  and indeed , he proved to be Reagan 's only competition , winning six primaries . Primaries can get rough , but Bush only cut loose at Reagan twice : He criticized Reagan 's proposal to blockade Cuba in retaliation for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ; theehe called Reagan 's tax plans " voodoo " economics . Pressed on his political differences with Reagan after being named his running mate , Bush said he " would n't be nickeled and dimed " - on said differences  --  ERA and a constitutional amendment banning abortion being two notable ones . By 1984 , it will probably be difficult to find such differences on issues between Reagan and Bush . As the ideal team-player , Bush is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valued administration member . As for George Bush himself , he has stated : " On 1984 , my plans are to have no plans . My plan is to be a good vice president , supportive of the President . I do n't discuss it and do n't let my staff talk about it either . I 'm not naive . I know there is speculation . But my view is to be a good vice president  --  and that 's it . " But it is fair to speculate about George Bush winding up as the Republican candidate for president in 1984 . The chances are one in three that any vice president will become president . In fact , five of America 's last 11 vice presidents moved into the Oval Office to sit in the chair of power . George Bush could become the sixth .
