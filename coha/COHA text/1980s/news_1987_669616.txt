It was the beginning of a journey that has astonished refugee aid workers in the region. // These men , women , and children , interviewed at a refugee camp here , trekked hundreds of miles across four countries , suffering hunger and imprisonment . To succeed , three adults learned three foreign languages and collected tips on how to survive along their long march to freedom . At one point , they swam for over seven hours at night across the ocean waters from Malaysia to Singapore. // // They were of three families ( Men , Lim , and Dan ) , three religions ( Christian , Buddhist , and Muslim ) , and ranged in age from one to 44 years . Often , when they feared all hope was lost , they prayed - some to Buddha , some to God , some to Allah. // Their journey is a tale of unusual courage , determination , and providence - unusual even in comparison with the thousands of other refugee dramas occurring daily in Southeast Asia. // It shows how decades of tragedy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration policies of many Western countries make the lives of refugees from Cambodia , Laos , and Vietnam , more desperate. // This is the story of the Men , Dan , and Lim families , told during more than 20 hours of interviews. // All 16 had been victims of communist forces in Cambodia after 1975 : first under the Khmer Rouge and its nearly four years of massive killings , then under Vietnamese troops who occupied the country after 1979 . They lost many close relatives either to starvation or execution . One of their leaders , Dan Rossaly , lost his first wife and baby daughter to a land mine , and his second wife in a mortar blast . He finally left Cambodia in 1985. // Before the three families met , each had made its own separate escape from Cambodia , walking through jungle , harassed by bandits and soldiers . Once in Thailand , they moved from refugee camp to refugee camp. // Each of the three families eventually went to Bangkok , hoping to be accepted for resettlement abroad with the help of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . ' ' They say to wait , ' ' said Dan Rossaly . ' ' But we wait for years . There is no hope. ' ' // Instead of being resettled , they were jailed by the Thai government for being illegals . It was in jail that they all met . They were all later sent back to a refugee camp on the border , where they lived together. // While in jail , Saur Sarik , the wife of Men Sambo , a Protestant who spoke French , learned English from a French-English dictionary , given her by Christian missionaries. // This , and knowledge of other languages , was vital to the group ' s success . Lim Pagna , a teen-ager traveling with his sister Lim Dila , learned Thai during four years as a Buddhist monk in a Thai monastery . Dan Rossaly , a Muslim , learned Malay , which is a language used in Indonesia and Malaysia , both Muslim countries . He also picked up something else. // In the Bangkok jail , one of Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Singapore often , illegally working his way from Thailand down through the Malaysian Peninsula . Each time , the Burmese was arrested in Singapore where he took odd jobs , and was sent back to Bangkok on a Thai fishing boat , only to repeat his journey again. // Using a map of Asia from a Qantas Airline Airways magazine , during the four months in prison , the Burmese taught Dan Rossaly the details of the trip - how to change currency , what to wear , and which Malaysian towns were safe resting points. // In late 1985 , all 16 members of the group were sent from jail to a refugee camp known as Site 2 . They feared being close to the fighting between Vietnamese troops and the three Cambodian resistance groups that operate near the border . Even worse , they feared that the men would be drafted by resistance groups to fight the Vietnamese. // ' ' I can not go back , can not stay in village ( the refugee border camp ) , ' ' Men Sambo , the oldest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to do it . If we escape and no one helps us , we will keep escaping until somewhere they will. ' ' // So the three families plotted their escape - to Singapore , where , they hoped , the US Embassy would approve their immigration . Men Sambo could get them out of Site 2 , Lim Pagna knew the safe way to Bangkok , and Dan Rossaly had learned how to get to Singapore . The plan started on April 10 when Dan Rossaly overheard Lim Pagna talking about escape. // Four days later , on the Buddhist new year , when they knew the guards would be drunk , the group arose at 3 a. m. and , in small groups , sneaked out of the camp disguised in the ragtag dress of smugglers , who are so common that they are often ignored by the guards . Instead of carrying the smuggler ' s traditional bags of rice , they carried their three small children in sacks. // The group broke through a fence , shed their smugglers garb , released the children from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lim guiding them to evade military checkpoints . Arriving in Aranyaprathet , they boarded a train to Bangkok. // Among them , they had about $250 in Thai currency . To avoid detection in the Thai capital , they slept under a bridge . The next day , they took a train south. // Before they reached the border , however , Thai police boarded at one stop , searching for suspected communist rebels who operate in southern Thailand . ' ' We were afraid , ' ' said Dan Rossaly . ' ' We had split up the group among the seats . We agreed that if one person were captured , the rest of us would ignore him. ' ' // The police passed them by. // At the border town of Sungai Ko-lok , they got off the train to avoid passport control . Dan changed currency and prepared to enter a Muslim country . The women bought traditional Muslim clothes , long head scarfs , and long skirts. // They paid for a short boat trip across the border . Dan , the only one who spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train or bus through Malaysia . ' ' They could catch anybody . And it is very bad when they catch you , ' ' he said. // They walked for several days to the large coastal city of Kota Baharu . There , in a bus station , they bought a detailed map of Malaysia. // They also bought 16 doughnut-shaped , inflatable , red ' ' balloon plastic ' ' tubes . These they would need for the long swim to Singapore . They cost $1 each , a large but necessary investment. // From April 21 to May 26 , they walked down the east coast of Malaysia , making 10 to 15 miles a day and relying on Dan ' s notes from his Burmese adviser. // It was vital to avoid about half a dozen police checkpoints over 450 miles of rural terrain . They walked at night or down railroad tracks . They slept in rubber plantations or in the forest . They ate coconuts found lying on the ground or crabs they caught in the ocean . They occasionally bought noodles or rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with sacks over their shoulders , to be farmers . If Dan asked for directions , he would ask only old men , and would say he was from the next village . No one helped them , and they didn ' t ask for any help. // ' ' We always talked to each other . We had strong solidarity , ' ' said Dan . ' ' We decided to be brothers and sisters , we told each other of our lives under the Khmer Rouge , under Lon Nol ( 1970-75 ) , under Prince ( Norodom ) Sihanouk ( 1954-70 ) . ' ' After five weeks of walking , they reached the tip of Malaysia . From Joho Baharu , they looked across a causeway stretching two-thirds of a mile to the modern city-state of Singapore. // They couldn ' t cross the bridge legally . And , if they wanted to avoid capture , they couldn ' t swim near it . Nor could they start their swim at the crowded part of the shoreline. // ' ' Over there , I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Men Mealiney , teen-age daughter of Men Sambo . ' ' In the day maybe we can ' t swim , but at night , water goes down , is calm. ' ' // So they waited until just after nightfall and entered the water farther up the peninsula . They blew air into the plastic tubes , and set out , holding the children ' s heads above water. // ' ' At first , I think if I swim this , I will die . Then I start to swim . The moon is rise up and I pray no moon , swim without being seen . I pray , and the moon goes dark in clouds , ' ' said 18-year-old Rim Raismay , one of two nephews adopted by the Mens when his family was ' ' lost , ' ' that is , relocated out of Phnom Penh by the Khmer Rouge. // After more than an hour of swimming , they reached land , on another small peninsula of Malaysia . The tubes proved unreliable , but they swam on , to yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tubes were no longer of use . Two of the men walked into a small fishing village and took two pieces of plastic foam , each about a half a foot thick and three by four feet wide. // ' ' It was the only thing we had to steal ( on the trip ) , ' ' Men Sambo said . Without these rafts , they knew they couldn ' t make it. // ' ' We put the babies and little children on the boards but we swam and pushed the ( plastic foam ) , ' ' said Saur Sarik . ' ' It is very horrible . We prayed and prayed to the God , help us or we will die in the sea . Lord , don ' t let someone catch us or something bad happen to us. ' ' // Her older daughter , Mealiney , remembers , ' ' Somewhere where I swim , water flow so strong . My cousin help me to get past that place. ' ' // When a Singapore marine police boat came near , they kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. m. , they reached shore . They landed on a duck farm near Lim Chu Gan area in Singapore . Not caring about the smell , they cut some large leaves for sleeping mats. // ' ' Maybe 5 o ' clock early morning we all woke up and wash faces with sea water . Some of us , no sandals , ' ' says Saur Sarik. // They walked to a road , asked directions from an old woman , and boarded a bus heading for the skyscrapers of downtown Singapore - and to the US Embassy. // ' ' I think ' My life OK ! ' ' ' said Dan Rossaly . ' ' I no longer afraid. ' ' // But they were hungry . And smelly . So partway to town they got off the bus and went into a cafeteria . They had never been in one before , and didn ' t know how it worked. // They felt strange under the eyes of the customers , went into the bathrooms , washed off the residual duck , and boarded another bus. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one stopped . When the driver heard their story , he stopped two other taxis , and all 16 refugees were taken to the US Embassy for free. // In the embassy courtyard , the group was met by US personnel. // ' ' We are refugees , ' ' Dan Rossaly told them. // Men Mealiney recalls , ' ' We sit on the floor , no water , no rice to eat , people say I pity , give us money . ' ' One American dropped an envelope containing $30 in Men Sambo ' s lap . They were given water , cigarettes , and chocolate. // The Singapore police and UN refugee officials came . The group was taken to the UN office , where again they told their story - and had a big lunch. // ' ' It ' s almost impossible to think that such a large group of different families could have come so far , ' ' said Mirza Kahn , the UNHCR official who interviewed the group . ' ' I know of only about eight refugees who swam the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all single males. ' ' // The Singapore police did not believe their story at first . ' ' You bluff , they said . You came on ship . ' No , no , I walk and I swam , ' ' ' remembers Men Sambo , ' ' No , ( the interrogator ) took off his shoe and hit me in the head . I am lucky it is a rubber shoe . ' ' The Cambodians led the police back to the duck farm to the leaf sleeping mats and plastic foam , still lying on shore. // ' ' You were lucky , ' ' the police told them. // Maybe , maybe not . Under Singapore law , the group had to go to jail . UNHCR officials went to the jail only once after that , according to the Cambodians , and promised to help them. // Men Sambo recalls , ' ' I am very happy that time . If you are in an immigration jail , you go soon to another country. ' ' // After 5 months in jail , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or being sent back to the refugee camps in Thailand. // ' ' Indochinese refugees entering Singapore illegally are not allowed to be resettled out of Singapore , ' ' Mr. Kahn said. // The choice was agonizing , but clear . In jail , they were often hungry . The cells were crowded . Their health was bad , they were separated , and they had given up hope . They agreed to go back. // ' ' I can not speak , because I pity the children . It is very terrible . I am very sorry and I regret my trip . My tear drop and drop , ' ' Men Sambo said. // At noon on Oct. 17 , the families were put on two large Thai fishing boats , given some food and money , and sent off. // About an hour after they left Singaporean waters , a storm came up . The boats took shelter at an island off Malaysia ' s western shore . The Cambodians begged one of the Thai captains , who spoke Khmer , to help them escape again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , ' ' said Men Sambo , ' ' if possible he will land us. ' ' // They spotted a wooden boat , powered by two blue-and-white sails . The Thai boats pulled up alongside . It was an Indonesian boat that had just unloaded a cargo of lumber in Malaysia. // One of the Indonesians pulled a knife. // ' ' I am Muslim , ' ' Dan Rossaly yelled at him. // ' ' So am I , ' ' said the Indonesian . ' ' I will help you. ' ' // ' ' But I am 16 people , ' ' Dan remembers saying. // ' ' I don ' t have enough food. ' ' // ' ' We have food. ' ' // The knife was put away , and the Cambodians boarded the sailboat . ' ' Hurry , before the Malaysia police come , ' ' the Thai told them. // The 16 were off again , on another escape . ' ' How many happy were we ! ' ' Saur Sarik said in what she described as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail across the Strait of Malacca , they landed on Padang Island . The Indonesian boat-owner told the residents of his home village about his extra cargo . The villagers came to visit the Cambodians , bringing food , clothing , candy , and money . Then the boat owner took them to the provincial capital , where they were put in an unlocked jail . He asked that they be allowed to resettle in Indonesia. // The government said no. // The police asked them to tell the villagers about the communists in Cambodia. // Ten days later , the group was taken by the UNHCR to a refugee center on Galang Island in Indonesia . They were interviewed by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service . After four months , 15 of the 16 were told they could go to the United States. // One of Saur Sarik ' s adopted sons , Rim Vantha , remains in Galang ; the reason for his rejection by the US is unclear . Sarik hopes he will be allowed to follow her next year . She says , ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the government . They told me ( it would be possible ) . But sometime they change their mind . My soul always fly to him in Galang. ' ' // In May , the 15 Cambodians flew to the Philippines to go to a special refugee processing center for a six-month training program in English language and American culture . Here , the group celebrated freedom - and a wedding between Men Sidana and Lim Pagna. // By late September , all but one member of the Men , Lim , and Dan families will be in the US . Their escape , with the possible exception of Rim Vantha , will be finished. // //
