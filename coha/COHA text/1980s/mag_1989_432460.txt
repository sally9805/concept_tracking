 | In a cramped conference room at the European Community headquarters in Brussels last July , Jack Valenti , president of the Motion Picture Association of America , spoke like a GI in a 1940s B movie . " I came here to see whether there 's peace or war , " said Valenti , referring to an EC proposal to impose quotas on American TV shows and movies broadcast in Europe . " You people just threw a grenade into our area , and the pin 's pulled out . " That grenade finally exploded last week . After months of haggling , the EC 's foreign ministers approved a new set of rules that will attempt to curb a flood of American imports that has made Euro-hits out of everything from dubbed versions of " Miami Vice " to the soap opera " Santa Barbara " to a French version of " Wheel of Fortune " called " La Roue de la Fortune . " As the community heads for economic " harmonization " in 1992 , the new regulations stipulate that at least half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural integrity . " Have we the right to exist ? " asked EC Commission president Jacques Delors before the 10-2 vote . American officials saw the decision as one more sign of an emerging " fortress Europe , " as U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills called it during a recent six-nation trip to Europe . Valenti , who served in World War II , called the decision " a step backward in time . " In fact , the war of words is really a look into the future . The real explosion is in Europe 's TV industry ? and the market for new programming , whether it comes from the Continent or America . New technology in the air and deregulation on the ground have combined to spur a dramatic increase in broadcast capacity . When the 1980s began there were only 28 major commercial TV channels in all of Europe ; today there are 56 . As satellite and cable delivery systems mature and more states ease restrictions over the next decade , the screen will get more crowded . It 's estimated that by 1995 there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill 200,000 more hours of air time a year . By the year 2000 , the ad-revenue kitty may be as large as 820 billion , compared with $9 billion today , according to a recent study by the advertising agency Saatchi &; Saatchi . As Bruce Steinberg , a London-based ad-sales director for MTV-Europe , puts it : " This is where the action is now . " So far , Hollywood 's share of that action has been growing rapidly . It rang up $844 million in movie and TV sales in Europe last year , a fivefold increase over 1980 . But European entrepreneurs are looking to cash in too . State-run TV mo- nopolies are being " privatized " across the Continent , although the pace of deregulation varies . ( Slowest : Sweden . Fastest : Italy . ) France has a flourishing new pay channel called " Canal Plus , " and West Germany has two satellite-fed commercial upstarts , SAT 1 and RTL-Plus . On the creative side , Europeans are mounting more joint productions in an effort to offset America 's economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 40 percent a year in Europe , according to a recent study by Booz , Allen &; Hamilton in London . The upbeat picture has n't been without some static . Language has been a barrier to some ambitious , pan-European projects . Two major ventures that offer programming only in English , Super Channel and Rupert Murdoch 's Sky Television , have encountered rough going and had to make strategic adjustments . For the time being , the most promising ventures will probably be confined within national borders . To succeed , Europewide programs will have to offer mostly nonverbal fare , like music videos and sports events . Quotas alone also wo n't guarantee the Europeans a dominant share of the TV market . The political rhetoric may be tough : " What will remain of our cultural identity , " asks France 's European Affairs Minister Edith Cresson , " if audiovisual Europe consists of European consumers sitting in front of Japanese TV sets showing American programs ? " But the quota language adopted last week is deliberately vague , calling for a " majority " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sharp American lawyers will be able to drive a John Wayne movie through those loopholes and bring a few Arnold Schwarzenegger flicks along for the ride . As long as viewers want to see American shows , executives at local Eurostations will find a way to air them . " What 's going to happen ? " asks Jan Steinmann , president of Scansat , a two-year-old company that beams mostly American shows via satellite to Sweden , Denmark and Norway . " Is a policeman going to knock on my door ? " ' Expanding market ' : With the businessmen who control the airwaves talking like that , Americans do n't need to get too worried about the 1992 politicking in Brussels . " We 're in an expanding market , " says Malcolm Vaughan , vice president of Twentieth Century-Fox Television , which sells programming to Europe . " How fierce could any quota be ? " Predicts Mark Astaire , media analyst for the brokerage firm Hoare Govett : " Quota or no quota , there are going to be rich pickings for everyone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its share of those rich pickings , but its reward may be an even bigger audience of loyal European viewers .
