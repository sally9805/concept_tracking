Come to Laurenland , the images whisper , where fantasy and finery go together like hand in well-stitched glove . Watch polo matches in Palm Beach , trim in a crested blazer and trousers of crisp linen . Sip cognac by the fireplace of a Sun Valley , chalet , snug under a brightly colored Navajo blanket and clad in a Nordic apres-ski sweater and wool twill slacks . Go on safari in Kenya wearing a bush jacket and khaki shorts that would do justice to Robert Redford in Out of Africa . Sip tea at London 's Connaught Hotel , draped to perfection in a chalk-stripe suit . <P> Fashion Designer Ralph Lauren grew up a long way from all the things he really admired : hand-tailored clothes , manor houses , sports cars , fine horses and manicured lawns . But call it a yearning process : as an outsider to that world , Bronx-born Lauren dreamed up his own brand of gentility and style . Now he has managed to create an image and a company that have nearly cornered the market for supplying today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivates the up-and-coming customer 's appreciation for things and dreams that last . <P> Lauren ( pronounced Laur-en ) has tailored a thriving conglomerate as well . Rarely if ever has a clothing designer established a product range so wide , a retailing network so extensive , a marketing image so well defined . That company , Polo/Ralph Lauren , expects total retail sales to hit $1.3 billion this year , a fourfold jump since 1981 . If Lauren 's company were publicly held , its retail revenues would place it 257th in this year 's FORTUNE 500 listings . The designer 's personal wealth is estimated to be $300 million , plus whatever he keeps after taxes this year on his projected 1986 profits of about $27 million . Lauren , his wife Ricky and their three children  --  Andrew , 17 , David , 14 , and Dylan , a daughter , 12  --  now live like restless aristocrats , shuttling by private jet among their homes in New York , Colorado and Jamaica . <P> In the ranking of the world 's designer royalty , Lauren , 46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's fashion parlance encompasses everything from swimsuits to semiformal evening wear . He reigns as the natural successor to Bill Blass and John Weitz , the first generation of U.S. celebrity designers . Lauren 's chief rival , as coincidence would have it , comes from the same Bronx neighborhood . He is Calvin Klein , who has crafted an image of sizzling sexiness as singular as Lauren 's aura of rich romance . But Lauren has kept ahead of his onetime neighbor in both popular and negotiable currency : Lauren 's total sales are estimated to be one-quarter larger than Klein 's . Overall , the U.S. champion money spinner appears to be Designer Liz Claiborne ( estimated 1986 sales : $1.8 billion ) , whose company sells primarily mid- priced clothes for professional women . But in terms of product range , prestige and marketing mystique , Lauren is the leader ( see chart ) . <P> Lauren sells an image of ready-to-wear prosperity , but there was nothing instant about his success in New York City 's gritty garment district . He worked hard , sold hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strategic planning brought him close to bankruptcy in 1972 . In the late 1970s , his Western Wear collection thrust Lauren into the fashion spotlight but failed financially .
