London 's theaters offer quite a show for visiting Americans <P> A cut-rate sun has risen over what used to be called the British Empire . That at least is the view from the far side of the Atlantic , as the dollar registers historic highs against the pound . For 2.5 million American travelers a year , a vacation in England-with frequent visits to its hallowed tourist lure , the theater-never looked so good . Britons may complain that some musicals , like the American import On Your Toes , are charging record ticket prices ( nearly $20 ) , but these are still lower than the cheapest admissions to most Broadway shows , and not a few off-Broadway . The best seat in most West End houses costs from $13 to $16 ; the National Theater offers many seats for about $6.50 ; and at the " fringe " theaters one can see first-rate plays for a fire-sale $4.25 . <P> Taking a hint from their Broadway brethren , London impresarios have stocked their theaters with musicals . There currently are 19 on display , ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story to such instant-nostalgia items as Peg ( a new show based on the 1912 J. Hartley Manners comedy ) and Singin ' in the Rain ( with aging sprite Tommy Steele in the Gene Kelly role ) . The big noise , though , comes from two dueling musicals . Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and Lyricist Tim Rice , once the Midas men of British songwriting with the shows Jesus Christ Superstar , Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Evita , have separated and are parading their new collaborators before London playgoers . <P> Lloyd Webber 's Starlight Express , a homage to trains , with lyrics by Richard Stilgoe , is ( surprise ! ) the season 's hottest ticket . It is also just about a total bust . For this multimedia combo of Rollerball and The Little Engine That Could , Designer John Napier has ramped and revamped the huge Apollo Victoria Theater , allowing the young cast room to roller-skate through three levels of the audience . But all the amplified sound and whirling energy can not hide the show 's vacuity . The story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an elephantine parody of his wondrous work on Nicholas Nickleby and Lloyd Webber 's Cats ; and the composer , who until now seemed an inexhaustible fountain of inventive melody , has devised a bluesy score that is sere and predictable . Lloyd Webber is no longer content simply to write musicals ; now he must mount spectacles for theatergoers who will accept something big in place of something good . The performers , led by Stephanie Lawrence and a break-dancing blur named Jeffrey Daniel , are energetic troupers whose relentless " high spirits serve to underline the inspiration , and ultimate destination , of Starlight Express : this is Vegas on ball bearings .
