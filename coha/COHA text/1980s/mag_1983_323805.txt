Eventually , the vice presidency will become " the logical next step <P> The six Democratic presidential hopefuls who appeared before the annual convention of the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) early this month may have promised only " to consider " a female running mate . But they stumbled over each other trying to say it with conviction . " I would be proud to run with a woman on either end of the ticket , " insisted Colorado Senator Gary Hart . Said Walter Mondale : " I see some contenders in this room . " <P> Indeed , 1984 is being touted as the year when a woman for the first time could conceivably become the vice presidential nominee of a major party . Most political handicappers say the odds are long , but some women have nonetheless made the vice presidency their rallying cry . Says Ann Lewis , political director of the Democratic National Committee ( D.N.C. ) : " They think of this as the logical next step . " <P> Not without good reason . Women now constitute 53% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnout rate ( 59% ) caught up with that of men and , for women under 45 , surpassed it by 3 points .

Come convention time , however , there will be countervailing pressure on the nominee to use traditional yardsticks , such as geographical and ideological balance , to select a potential running mate . " It 's a no-win situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominee chooses a woman , he 'll be accused of caving in to the activists . If he does n't , he 'll still just be a good ole boy . " <P> Moreover , there are no female Democratic Governors or Senators , two conventional springboards to the vice presidency . Admits Stephanie Solien , executive director of the Women 's Campaign Fund : " The pool of women who would make a good candidate is quite small . " Herewith , the women most frequently cited on the Democrats ' short list : <P> &gt; Corinne C. ( " Lindy " ) Boggs , 67 . A six-term House veteran from a 45% black New Orleans district , she voted against Reagan 's budget cuts and supports a nuclear freeze . She could help Mondale in the South , but her antiabortion record hurts her with many women 's groups . <P> &gt; Dianne Feinstein , 50 .
