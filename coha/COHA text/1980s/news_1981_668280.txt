A 16-year-old black youth leaned against a handrail on the steps of Russell High School in East Point as a cab pulled up with a man in the back seat . The man asked the boy to come forward . He didn ' t move . When the man began to approach him , the youth stared coldly . Only after the man identifiedhimself as a reporter and explained that he wanted an interview did Donald Howard begin to loosen up . Later , the cab driver said : " Before all those killings , that boy would have rushed right up to the cab . But now , they don ' t approach cars like they used to . The kids are more cautious today . " If anything came out of the tragic deaths of 28 of Atlanta ' s black children in the past two years , it is that the city ' s youth are more careful with whom they meet or talk , and their parents have an increased concern for the safety of their children . " I think it ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Beverly Harvard , public information officer for Atlanta ' s Department of Public Safety . " We only regret that it took a crisis like this for people to have a heightened awareness of personal safety for their children . " Even so , Atlantans these days appear much more relaxed than they did a year ago , when the city was gripped with fear and anger as one missing child after another turned up dead , many of them pulled from the nearby Chattahoochee River . There are two major reasons for the city ' s more relaxed posture . One is the arrest in June of Wayne B. Williams , 23 , a freelance photographer and self-styled talent scout . Williams was indicted for two of the killings , those of Jimmy Ray Payne , 21 , and Nathaniel Cater , 28 , the last and oldest victim . Of the 28 victims - not including a child still missing - four were adults , and the rest ranged in ages between 7 and 16 . But the prime reason for Atlanta ' s calm is that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reported . And as the days and months have passed without a similar incident , the fear among Atlantans gradually has diminished . Also missing is the anger many Atlantans directed at the police department , the mayor and other authorities during the seemingly endless string of murders . " That anger was normal , " explained Janet Douglas , director of Atlanta ' s Community Relations Commission . " When there is a murderer loose like Jack the Ripper , the people don ' t get angry at him , they vent it on the police and the mayor . But you don ' t see that anger when the murderer is found . What the media failed to understand is that is the usual dynamics in such cases . They have to get angry at somebody . My commission thinks the police department did an excellent job . " With Williams in custody , and with the anger and fear largely behind Atlanta ' s residents , Douglas says : " I think people have relaxed a lot . There is an edgy sense of peace initially since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , father of two boys , 15 and 12 , agrees . " While all this killing was going on , I would check on them very closely . If they didn ' t get home by a certain time after school , I would wonder and worry where they were , why they had been gone for so long . Now , I ' m not as much concerned about them . They stop and play basketball on the way home . " I ' m more relaxed now because I ' m kind of convinced that the guy they got in custody did the killings , the majority of them anyway . I think many of the others were parent-related . So as long as they keep Wayne Williams in custody , the people here feel more secure , " Schaffers said . But some residents , including teenagers , still have doubts as to whether authorities have the person who committed at least some of the murders . " I don ' t think they got the right guy , " said Donald Howard as he looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it ' s part of a conspiracy , you know . They arrest him and get everything straight , and then the man on the street is going to start killing again . That ' s how I feel . " During the slayings , Howard said , " I was a little scared . But he was doing no killing in my neighborhood . I don ' t really stay over on this side of town ( East Point* . I live and stay over at Cottage Park . " Asked how he feels today , Howard answered : " In a way , I feel safer for the time being until I see what the deal is on Wayne Williams , whether he is guilty or not guilty . " Charles Blalock , a waiter at Atlanta ' s Midnight Sun Restaurant who was a friend of one of the victims , believes Williams is involved in the murders " in some type of way , perhaps not to the extent he is being accused , but I definitely believe he ' s involved . " Douglas said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conspiracy . " Just a few people feel that if he is the killer , that there was some other group behind him . " In fact , she added , most people in Atlanta are hardly discussing the possibility of other child murderers still on the streets . " I don ' t find people even talking about that . It ' s probably too frightening for people to think there are other murderers loose . I think people are blanking out on that . Instead , they seem to be thinking , Well , they got one , and that ' s good . ' " Douglas pointed out , however , that " there is a debate going on among the news media and other people whether parents have become too relaxed with their children . " As for the ongoing investigation the rest of the murders , Douglas maintains that there is no relaxing in that area . " Our special task force is still extremely busy trying to solve the other murders . " At the same time , the prosecution is having its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial Oct. 5 , but a key motion , along with numerous other motions , forced Fulton County Superior Court Judge Clarence Cooper to indefinitely delay the trial . The motion , which Cooper granted , requires the court to read the voluminous files on all the murdered victims and to turn over any evidence that might be helpful to the defendant ' s case . Williams was first questioned in the slayings when he was stopped after police , staking out a bridge on the Chattahoochee River , heard a loud splash in the water during the predawn hours of May 22 . After police heard the splash , one of them looked up and saw Williams ' car slowly moving off the bridge . Williams was stopped , questioned and let go . Two days later , Cater ' s body floated to the surface downstream from the bridge . Payne ' s body was found a month earlier in the same area of the river . Williams was arrested June 21 . So far , more than 40 motions were filed by Williams ' attorneys . Many still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there were signs that Judge Cooper was becoming a little upset with the continuous motions . Myrian Richmond , speaking for Judge Cooper , said he " has been concerned that the defense have adequate time to prepare its case . But he knows that a speedy trial is of utmost importance . So he had to remind the defense that they have a reponsibility to their client and to the court to move ahead as quickly as possible . " The prosecution ' s public evidence against Williams involves dog hairs and rug fibers . Williams was held in July for grand jury action , and later indicted , after experts found " no significant microscopic differences " between the hairs and fibers found on Cater ' s body and those found on the rug in Williams ' bedroom and on his dog . Although it was not disclosed why Williams was also indicted for Payne ' s death , prosecutors plan to use the Payne case to bolster the Cater case , according to reports . Some observers argued that the microscopic evidence against Williams may play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told reporters that there was other evidence against Williams , but would not elaborate . As Atlantans , and the rest of the nation , await the outcome of the cases against Williams , the experts try to assess the impact the 28 tragic slayings have on children in this city and elsewhere . " Psychologists have told us it will take time to determine the impact of those murders , not only on our kids , but to kids across the country , " said Douglas . " This is the first time they have been faced with the realization there is a child murderer among the grownups . " She said that during the height of the killings , when bodies were turning up every one or two weeks , " we heard that many kids were hysterical when they found out they were going to Atlanta . " As for Atlanta ' s children , their classroom behavior was affected by the murders , Douglas said . " The school system reported the children were doing a lot of acting out . They were really hyper , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety among them . As for this year , we have not yet received reports on how the children are doing this year in school . " But Douglas and others are looking beyond the school year to next summer , when the children will be on the streets again . Referring to this year ' s Safe Summer program , where business and religious organizations provided jobs , programs , and summer camp to several thousand youngsters , Douglas said : " People went out of their way to help the kids , which I think should be normal procedure every year . I just hope next summer the kids are not dropped like hot potatoes . "
