The official , Col. Fletcher H. Griffis Jr. , the district engineer for the corps , said , however , that the pivotal issue remained whether New York State would submit an acceptable plan by July 15 to cushion the Westway ' s impact on the Hudson River striped bass. // " Mitigation is technically feasible , " he said in an interview . " Whether it ' s institutionally feasible I ' m not sure. " // By that , the colonel explained , he meant that the burden was still on the state to prove its commitment to maintain an artificial habitat for the bass in New York Harbor and to enlist the cooperation of New Jersey officials if necessary. // // State Promises Habitat // // Earlier yesterday , James L. Larocca , the State Transportation Commissioner and the first witness , pledged " the unequivocal commitment of the State of New York to utilize the results of our studies - and other available information - to implement a plan to provide at least an equivalent amount of acreage for that impacted by the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to exist and the striped-bass population prospers. " // But Mayor Gerald McCann of Jersey City , threatening to join lawsuits against the Manhattan highway and landfill project , testified later that " Jersey City will not stand idly by and allow New York City to develop its waterfront at the expense of New Jersey and Jersey City. " // " The corps proposes as its sole mitigation alternative that New Jersey should forgo redevelopment of a large waterfront parcel of land to offset the loss of striped-bass habitat resulting from the construction of Westway , " Mr. McCann said . " Jersey City is unalterably opposed to any mitigation proposals that will have a detrimental effect on our waterfront redevelopment projects. " // Mayor Koch delivered another endorsement for the Westway yesterday through his Transportation Commissioner , Anthony R. Ameruso . <> <> ' Zero Dollars ' // // " I support Westway because it offers the people of this city an opportunity to recapture the waterfront , to develop a spectacular park , to build new housing , to get trucks off local streets and to reduce air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor ' s statement said . " I can think of no other project that promises so many benefits to this city - and at so little cost : ' zero dollars . ' " Interstate highways are financed 90 percent by the Federal government and 10 percent by the state. // The proposed 93-acre strip of parkland along the Hudson was described at the hearing by Orin Lehman , the State Parks Commissioner , who declared : " Your decision must weigh the merits of this park against the blight that now exists and will continue to exist without Westway . There is no park without Westway and no Westway without the park. " // And Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan , Democrat of New York , said through a spokesman that " surely we can find an environmentally sound way to begin Westway . " <> <> Underground Highway // // A permit to dredge and then fill the river is considered the final adminstrative obstacle to the project , which was formally unveiled a decade ago . The Westway project would create 169 acres of landfill off Manhattan ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . The Westway itself , a six-lane highway , would run mostly underground between the Battery and 42d Street. // In 1982 , a landfill permit was revoked by a Federal judge who found that officials and consultants had conspired to understate the project ' s impact on the striped bass. // But the issues raised at the corps ' s hearings went well beyond the bass . <> <> Thousands of Empty Seats // // Of the 89 witnesses who testified over 13 hours on the first day of hearings , which ended at 10 : 40 P.M. , 62 opposed the project and 27 expressed support . No one was listed as noncommittal. // Yesterday , during 12 1/2 hours of hearings , which ended at 10 : 30 P.M. 119 people testified , with 100 opposed , 15 in favor and 4 noncommitted. // The speakers and spectators filled fewer than 2 percent of the more than 4 , 000 seats at the Felt Forum , which the corps had rented for $5 , 000 a day. // These numbers alone do not reflect the passion brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with fish here , we ' re dealing with lives and families , " said Gregory Sperduto , the apprentice coordinator of Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , who cited the jobs that the Westway would create for his members. // " At what point does the buck stop ? " asked Susan Brownmiller , the author , who lives in Greenwich Village . Delivering a defense of the Hudson River , she said the project " can not be justified in this age of urban ecology and environmental concern " and told corps officials : " You have it within your power to make a great moral determination. " <> <> 23 Questions // // Colonel Griffis had already jotted down 23 questions that he planned to wrestle with before he decides , by Oct. 25 , whether to recommend that a landfill permit be granted. // " I ' ve got to check the arithmetic again , " he said , referring to the cost of the project and to the landfill development. // Among the concerns that he said had been raised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ranged during the testimony from the official $2 billion up to $26 billion ; the apparent conflict between existing development plans and the Sanitation Department ' s intention to build an incinerator and a pier for loading garbage barges on 50 acres of the landfill , and the relative densities of the adjacent neighborhoods compared with the planned 7 , 100 apartments. // Other issues , he said , are the state ' s financial commitment to maintain the Westway park and whether there is a precedent for the state ' s maintenance of the city park , the current commercial activity on the remaining West Side piers , and how the Convention Center , under construction , would be integrated with the Westway . <> <> Construction From River // // During a break in the hearing , the colonel also questioned two of the objections raised by the Westway ' s opponents. // Disruption to local neighborhoods would be lessened because much of the project could be built from the river , he said , and " the more I think about 10 years of construction , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents had said that trading in the $2 billion earmarked for the Westway to finance a more modest highway and mass-transit improvements would relieve pressure to raise bus and subway fares. // " Will trade-in reduce subway fares ? " Colonel Griffis asked . " I believe it won ' t have any effect. " // Addressing the question of mitigation , Commissioner Larocca said the West Side waterfront was itself an artificial habitat for the bass and one that would vanish even if the Westway was never built. <> <> 3 , 700 Acres Are Available // // Would the corps , in order to protect the habitat , be prevented from removing crumbling piers , Mr. Larocca asked rhetorically . No , he replied , paraphrasing Charles Dickens , because " the law is not an ass. " // " Only the misapplication of the law by man makes the law an ass , " he said. // He proposed to improve water quality in the estuary , dredge shallow areas and retard the current in the 94 acres between the landfill and the pierhead line , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis Islands , the Morris Canal Basin , off Riverside Park and along the west bank of the river from Hastings to just south of the George Washington Bridge - and well north of Jersey City. // " If four centuries of acts and omissions have produced the waterfront we see today , can not a few years of careful planning , thought and concern produce a better result ? " Mr. Larocca asked . " Surely with intelligent ecological management we can do better than we have by neglect and indifference. " // Other witnesses variously described the bass as " a political football " and " a red herring. " // But Robert Boyle , representing the Hudson River Fishermen ' s Association , explained that the striped-bass population is " at a perilous low in the Chesapeake Bay , and stocks in the Hudson are just that more important . All indications are that the Hudson is the only major supplier of striped bass on the coastal run at this time. " // " Allowing Westway to be built would be to fire a torpedo at Noah ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tunnels // // James Tripp , a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund , cited what he said were flaws in the corps ' s draft supplemental environmental impact statement and warned that the state ' s mitigation proposals " should not be used as a bribe. " // Charles Bell , an executive vice president of Hilton International , said the " real purpose " of the project is real-estate development . He predicted that traffic bottlenecks at the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel would result . Mr. Bell , a Greenwich Village resident , said he was appearing privately and not on behalf of his company , which manages the Vista International hotel and restaurants at the World Trade Center. // Nor , said Douglas John Bowen of the New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers , would the Westway relieve congestion at the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels. // Also testifying in opposition were tenants occupying space on the piers , including an auto-leasing concern and a producer of television commercials , and local residents. // " I am not an expert in any field except being a citizen of this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street and expressed concern that the Westway " would disrupt my life totally. " // State Assemblyman Albert Vann of Brooklyn , in a statement read by an aide , Richard Flateau , raised a broader concern : " It does not square with the utilitarian model of doing the greatest good for the greatest number . Westway will only serve a small segment of New York City ' s population - those with motor vehicles and those affluent enough to afford taxi service . Westway is a redistribution of resources - taking from the poor to subsidize the rich . " <> <> Reclaiming the West Side // // " There is no showing that a landfill of this size is a requirement " to meet transportation needs , said Adrian De Wind , the former president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. // Richard T. Anderson , the executive vice president of Regional Plan Association , said , however , that the Westway is the only environmentally sound proposal to replace the demolished West Side Highway . It would " reclaim Manhattan ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would generate four times the economic benefit as a mass transit trade-in , including 100 , 000 man-years of employment. // " Our failure to get started - in spite of the support of the last three Mayors of New York City , the last three Governors of New York State and the last four United States Secretaries of Transportation - is making us appear enormously foolish and shortsighted in the eyes of the nation . " <> <> Trade Unionists Testify // // Other supporters included spokesmen for the General Contractors Association and Citizens for Balanced Transportation and union officials representating carpenters and tile finishers. // " The existing conditions favored by the fish are there by accident , " said John Bertrand of the International Union of Operating Engineers . Is displacing the fish " justification for society to turn its back on progress ? " he asked // Joseph Tolento 3d , an electrician , said : " We are worrying about the displacement of fish when we should be worried with the displacement of so many young unemployed. " // " Westway can spawn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , " said Brian McLaughlin , of the Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry , a labor-management group. // " The important thing is to able to work to feed your family , " said Allen Morio . " I have been unemployed in the construction industry . I no longer want to be out of work. " // //
