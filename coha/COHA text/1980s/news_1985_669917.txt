CERREJON , Colombia  --  White men long have regarded the Guajira Peninsula as a desert wasteland , suitable only for smugglers and nomadic Indians . They know , however , that the Indians stoked their campfires with bits of coal lying on the desert soil . Today that coal is about to transform the Colombian economy . This week , a major new mine , developed jointly by Exxon Corp. and the Colombian government , began shipping coal by rail across the desert . Production is expected to grow from three million metric tons this year to 15 million tons in 1989 . By that time , the Colombians believe , the Cerrejon coal mine would be the largest in Latin America , and miners here will be digging the equivalent of another Panama Canal every 18 months . With coal in oversupply around the world , it won ' t be easy for Colombia to crack the competitive export market . Nevertheless , the coal should enable Colombia to end its centuries-old dependence on a single export commodity , coffee . Despite decades of trying to diversify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of Colombia ' s $3. 7 billion in total legal exports last year . ( Illegal exports of marijuana and cocaine are worth significantly more , most estimates say , but no one knows how much of that illicit gain actually returns to benefit Colombia . ) The danger in dependence on coffee is that an entire economy can be undermined by a slump in a single product . By 1989 , when Cerrejon is expected to reach full production , Colombian coal exports should be roughly half those of coffee . In the following decade , if the mine is expanded further , " Exports from coal could be comparable to those from coffee , " says an Exxon spokesman . In addition to coal , Colombia should be exporting modest amounts of oil by the end of the decade , thanks to some recent oil finds . The energy revolution already is improving Colombia ' s credit rating . " Cerrejon makes a tremendous difference to their foreign-exchange profile , " a New York banker says . " There isn ' t any question that , with exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Cerrejon is still a gamble . World demand for coal is growing , but not nearly as quickly as supply . " If Colombian coal is going to be absorbed it ' s going to have to take market share away from someone , " a U.S. Department of Energy official says . One likely candidate is the U.S. itself , which has enormous capacity to expand but can ' t meet low-cost producers on price . " Whatever Colombia produces is going to displace U.S. coal in some market , " says Connie Holmes , a National Coal Association official . " The reason is pure and simple , price . " Colombia ' s chief market will be Europe , where power plants in the past 10 years have converted from oil to coal and nuclear energy . Cerrejon ' s product is clean , relatively high-quality bituminous coal  --  the type preferred by power plants . " We already have commitments to sell all the coal we can export in 1985 , " a spokesman for the project says . But the mine will need many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is plenty of competition in Europe from other low-cost producers . Poland , which has bounced back from its Solidarity-years slump , is producing at record levels , and Australia , Canada , the Soviet Union , China and South Africa are expanding capacity . The oversupply , if it lasts , could jeopardize Colombian revenue targets , which are based on steadily increasing coal prices . But analysts estimate that Cerrejon coal will be profitable even at the current price in Europe of $44 a metric ton . For Colombia , the project should work at almost any price , because it will bring in badly needed dollars . For Exxon , the jury is still out . The Cerrejon deposit was discovered by 19th century explorers , but without an adequate port or land transportation nobody thought it was worth developing . Then in 1973 , the Arab oil embargo drove up oil prices , and a consensus developed that alternative energy would be needed . Exxon signed an association agreement with Carbocol , Colombia ' s state oil company , in 1976 , when it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The average price of U.S. coal exports had risen to $50. 83 a ton from its pre-embargo level of $20. 64 . Since then , however , the price has risen by only 10 cents  --  to $50. 93 . The oil glut of the last few years has darkened the outlook for coal prices as well . " The economics aren ' t the same as they were when Exxon went into the project , " says Daniel Roling , a coal analyst with Merrill Lynch &; Co . Exxon won ' t discuss the project ' s return , but a spokesman says " it would be profitable with full production at today ' s prices . " Exxon and Carbocol each put up half the $3. 2 billion investment . Exxon , the operator , provided technology , and Colombia supplied its coal . In theory , they will share production evenly , but after royalties and income taxes Colombia should wind up with about 85% of the profits through the year 2008 . After that , Exxon is out , and there will be enough coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another 100 years . Everything associated with the project is on a vast scale . Trucks will scoop up 50 tons of coal in each shovelful ; trains will ferry 10 , 000-ton loads at 55 m. p. h. to the new port of Puerto Bolivar , Colombia ' s largest . The mine itself is a vast gray pit in the middle of an arid plain . Cerrejon , named after a nearby hill , has brought a change for the Guajiro Indians , who make up 30% of the work force . Indians who hadn ' t ever held a job are operating 150-ton trucks . When the mine is completed , though , the work force will be cut back sharply . And most likely , many of the Guajiros will return to their traditional livelihoods of fishing , farming and smuggling . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
