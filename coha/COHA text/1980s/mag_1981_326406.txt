CIA finds no P.O.W.s in Laos , but M.I.A. families keep hoping <P> The Viet Nam War is long over , and for most Americans , best forgotten . But there remains a nagging concern-and for many families a daily grief-that , when the U.S. got out of Southeast Asia , it may have left dozens , even hundreds of P.O.W.s behind . Past Administrations have tacitly assumed that there may be some survivors among the 2,528 men missing , including 560 lost in Laos . The anguished families believe that as many as 300 of them are still alive . Neither Viet Nam nor Laos admits holding any prisoners , and no one has ever found solid proof . <P> But the U.S. Government has tried . According to a front-page story in the Washington Post last week , Defense Intelligence Agency analysts studying satellite photographs had spotted seemingly persuasive evidence of an American prisoner-of-war camp in Laos . The Central Intelligence Agency then trained and organized a group of Laotian mercenaries-many of them Hmong hill tribesmen-who crossed the border from Thailand and got close enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion , according to Defense Department Spokesman Henry Catto : " There is no evidence that would lead us to believe there are Americans being held in Laos . " <P> The Hmong tribesmen were apparently the first secret reconnaissance force to enter Laos on behalf of the soldiers missing in action but not the first ones to try . Angered by the refusal of the Carter Administration to accept and act on the uncertain proof that Americans are being held in Southeast Asia , families of the missing raised a dozen-man commando squad of their own-an underfinanced and overaged group of veterans from the Green Berets . Their improbable training center for an operation code-named " Velvet Hammer " was an academy for cheerleaders in Leesburg , Fla. , near Orlando . Their leader was retired Lieut . Colonel James ( " Bo " ) Gritz , 42 , a former Army public affairs officer who served in Viet Nam and who now works for Hughes Helicopter in Culver City , Calif . Gritz ( rhymes with beets ) may not have been the ideal choice to run the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychic , a hypnotherapist , an ABC News crew and a Washington Post reporter to serve as " historical record keeper . " After spending about $40,000 of the P.O.W. families ' rescue money , Gritz 's squad disbanded-according to Gritz , at the request of the Government . <P> Enter the CIA , which decided to organize its own mission on the basis of reconnaissance photographs that suggested the presence of a P.O.W. camp in Laos , near the former Ho Chi Minh Trail . <P> The photographs appeared to show people taller than native Laotians , using tools too big for natives , sometimes sitting cross-legged on the ground , instead of squatting Oriental-style . Surrounding them , it appeared , was a stockade with towers . Perhaps most persuasive , an aerial photograph showed the numerals 52 outlined on the ground . No one is sure what that number might signify : 52 prisoners in the camp , perhaps , or that the captives were the crew of one of the B-52s that had been shot down over the region . Because the numerals were first observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 52 American hostages released from Iran .
