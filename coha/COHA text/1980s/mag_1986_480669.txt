Dorothy Parker once said of James Thurber 's animals that " it is bet to say but little . .. one goes all weak with sentiment . " Dorothy Parker is not the only person to have said something foolish about Thurber , but she is perhaps the most interesting . I find myself moved to write about the idiotic things that have been said about Thurber by Parker and other , duller critics largely because I keep having the feeling that the world is going to hell in a handbasket ? this and a feeling that we need a hero , a champion of the imagination . Thurber was capable not only of making a life and an art out of the American heroic tradition but , astonishingly , of revising that tradition to include dogs . Thurber claimed that nothing of any significance happened to him until he moved to Connecticut and began raising Scotties at the age of thirty-three . In the opening of his famous piece " The Admiral on the Wheel , " he writes of the sort of thing Scotties are capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other morning , it was the first time they had been broken since the late Thomas A. Edison 's seventy-ninth birthday . I remember that day well , because I was working for a newspaper then and I had been assigned to go over to West Orange that morning and interview Mr. Edison . I got up early and , in reaching for my glasses under the bed ( where I always put them ) , I found that one of my more sober and reflective Scotch terriers was quietly chewing them . Both tortoiseshell temples ( the pieces that go over your ears ) had been eaten and Jeannie was toying with the lenses in a sort of jaded way . Chewing up glasses is a formidable task for a dog , and I have never heard of any but the gamest of terriers taking it on . Lesser dogs go for slippers and books ; Scotties , pit bulls , and the like typically despise such easy game and go for glasses , can openers , the metal apparatus in your car that moves the seat back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harper's. foundations of the house . And Thurber 's Jeannie , even more impressively , was accomplishing this quietly and without fanfare , " ... toying with the lenses in a sort of jaded way . " One must remember that Thurber had only one eye , the other having been destroyed in a boyhood accident , when he was struck by an arrow while playing cowboys and Indians ? and remember , too , that in the remaining eye he had only partial vision without his glasses . So when he calls Jeannie " one of my more sober and reflective Scotch terriers , " it is possible to think he intends the word reflective in some simplemindedly ironic fashion ? which he does not intend at all . This is one of the many places Thurber dogs figure as emblems of power of thought , both human and canine . Dogs and reflectiveness are both to be respected in Thurber . The glasses incident appears again , in " In Defense of Dogs , Even , After a Fashion , Jeannie . " He does n't blame her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no place for glasses . If I had put them on the dresser , Jeannie would never have eaten them , mainly , of course , because she could n't reach that high , but that is beside the point . " It is beside the point because this story is a parable about what it is to be serious about life and art . In this parable , you are blind because that which you have bred and authored and love has chewed up your glasses ? and you go forth anyway , and you go forth without whining about it , which is exactly what Thurber seems to have done . Even in biographies written by those who seem bent on playing Find the Writer 's Blemishes , Thurber 's gallantry comes through . But biographers do say astounding things like this : that the loss of Thurber 's eye in that archery accident accounted for his genius . For instance , from Charles S. Holmes 's biography : " The psychological impact of the injury was more significant than the physical .... In compensation he cultivated his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEBRUARY ? the American heroic tradition to include not only dogs but also women . For this ( and much else ) he is one of my feminist heroes . His men do not get depressed when they discover that women are not necessarily eternally twenty-two , suntanned , sinewy , and obedient . ( They are too busy being depressed about things like war and psychology and bad writing . ) A great deal of Thurber 's art is a celebration of the contrary , difficult , stubborn , bitchy , powerful possibilities of the female in Western tradition . His women , at their best , are virtually never in danger of succumbing to the Cinderella Complex and are not about to let their men settle comfortably into the Peter Pan Syndrome . What he finds wrong with women and men as twentieth-century America presented them to him is remarkably like what feminism at its best found wrong with them . It took Thurber a while to parlay this knowledge into art , but the point is that he did manage it . When I call Thurber a feminist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays and succors me at moments when new versions of the ideally sweet , supportive , and harmless woman come my way at unexpected moments . You know the sort of thing ; it goes like this : Women writers cooperate with and are grateful to the books of their predecessors . The masculine tradition is that anxiously suspicious and competitive one so ably and anxiously described by Harold Bloom ; women , by contrast , support and nourish each other 's writings . The male tradition of triumphant and anti-social excellence is alien to the feminine literary intelligence . Although I opened my essay with an example of the foolishness of Dorothy Parker , it now amuses me to imagine her response to the suggestion that she should write cooperatively and gratefully ? and makes me wish for her gift of witty dismissal . For I am unhealthily afflicted with the impulse to argue . Fortunately , I am not alone . There is Thurber , with his wonderfully combative women . I just reach to my bookshelf , open Thurber 's Dogs , and find " Canines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role models , his mother . The occasion is a pending visit from old Aunt Mary , whom our heroine , Mame Thurber , dislikes and does not nourish . Aunt Mary in her turn hates the Thurber family 's dogs , which gives Mame an idea : lMjy mother spent the afternoon gathering up all the dogs of the neighbourhood , in advance of Aunt Mary 's appearance , and putting them in the cellar . I had been allowed to go with her on her wonderful forays , and I thought that we were going to keep all the sixteen clogs we rounded up .... The big moment finally arrived . My mother asked if the old lady would be good enough to set down a plate of dog food in the kitchen at the head of the cellar stairs and call Judge and Sampson to their supper .... When the door opened and they could see the light of freedom and smell the odor of food , they gave tongue like a pack of hunting hounds . Aunt Mary got the door halfway open and the bodies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . There was a snarling , barking , yelping swirl of yellow and white , black and tan , gray and brindle as the dogs tumbled into the kitchen .... When the last one had departed and the upset house had been put back in order , my father said to his wife , " Well , Mame , I hope you 're satisfied . " She was . should have stuck to humor and not have tried to get involved with ideas . About his art , W. H. Auden said in 1940 that " it would be as impertinent as it is unnecessary for me to praise Mr. Thurber 's work ; everyone knows and loves it . " It may still be impertinent to praise Thurber , but it is no longer unnecessary . Thurber himself claimed that he wrote humor " because it might do some good , " and in one interview he said cunningly , " Some people even think I make jokes about dogs . For God 's sake , anybody who looks at my drawings with enough observation should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typical of the stuREVISION 71 pidity of our own species was my cartoon worn-an who said , ' If I rang the wrong number , why did you answer the phone ? ' That seems typical of the female intelligence , though I do get intelligent letters from women . Notice the despair and resignation of the dog in that picture .... I think we are in a terrible state .... I say these things and people just talk about my ' charming dogs ' . . . " I think that managing to believe Thurber in this and other passages entails understanding that Thurber was as serious about women as he was about art , and maybe even as he was about dogs . The cartoon in question does capture my own sense of the kind of stupidity one is most likely to find in women , for whatever reason , just as so many of his stories and cartoons capture the particular forms of stupidity one is most likely to find in men , for whatever reason . There is a lot of stupidity around ; noticing it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathology of spirit but of a capacity to care about the mind . Pieces like " An Outline of Scientists " really bother the critics , who are taken in by Thurber 's canny refusal to flash his intellectual ID card . " An Outline of Scientists " opens by giving its own occasion , the writer 's having been " laid up by a bumblebee . " The bumblebee was , at that time , an icon of natural science , so when he goes on to say that " it was the first time in my life that anything smaller than a turtle had ever got the best of me , and naturally I do n't like to dwell on it , " the clear implication is that science is smaller than a turtle , and also that it has the power to get the best of us . To amuse himself while laid up by the bumblebee , he reads through four impressive volumes called The Outline of Science , a Plain Story Simply Told and describes his perplexities as he tries to follow the simply told explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is losing its hold on the imagination as an emblem of the perfections of the mysteries of science , but in 1937 , the copyright date of Let Your Mind Alone , the volume Thurber 's piece appears in , both " relativity " and " Einstein " were unsurpassable nouns . The description of perplexity Thurber gives is as fine a description of the way the rhetoric of Oppression Through Allegories of Theory goes as I know of . It reminds me of my attempts to follow , at the age of seventeen , the arguments in volumes such as Bertrand Russell 's The ABC of Relativity without developing dark and impolite theories about the author . Thurber does go on to develop dark and impolite theories after he reads this paragraph in Chapter XXXVI , " The Story of Domesticated Animals " : There are few dogs which do not inspire affection ; many crave it . But there are some which seem to repel us , like the bloodhound . True , man has made him what he is . Terrible to look at and terrible to encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow man . Nearly twenty years later , Thurber 's " Lo , Hear the Gentle Bloodhound ! " appeared in Thurber 's Dogs ; it is there that he gets around to saying , " It pleases me no end that this passage , in its careless use of English , accidentally indicts the human being : ' Terrible to look at and terrible to encounter , man .... ' " I do n't know if this fine piece is one of the examples of what some critics call his decline into seriousness or not . In any case , in bed with a bumblebee sting and the science books , he saw that Accompanying the article was a picture of a dignified and mournful looking bloodhound , about as terrible to look at as Abraham Lincoln , about as terrible to encounter as Jimmy Durante . Poor , frightened little scientist ! I wondered who he was .... Some of the chapters were signed , but this one was n't , and neither was the one on the Einstein theory .... I had the strange feeling that both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the strange feeling that all scientists are the same man . Could it be possible that I had isolated here , as under a microscope , the true nature of the scientist ? It pleased me to think so ; it still pleases me to think so . I have never liked or trusted scientists very much , and I think now that I know why : they are afraid of bloodhounds . They must , therefore , be afraid of frogs , jack rabbits , and the larger pussycats .... Out of my analysis ... I have arrived at what I call Thurber 's Law , which is that scientists do n't really know anything about anything . I doubt everything they have ever discovered . I do n't think light has a speed of 7,000,000 miles per second at all ( or whatever the legendary speed is ) . Scientists just think light is going that fast , because they are afraid of it . It 's so terrible to look at . I have always suspected that light just plodded along , and now I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood than most says of this piece , " Because scientists do sometimes fail to understand a bloodhound , the reader 's heart lifts up .... ( Scientists too can be routed .... " This is right as far as it goes . But Thurber does not say merely that science can fail in this or that particular ; his is rather an assault on the intellectual foundation of scientific thought ? its claim to " objectivity . " It of course follows from the claim of objectivity ? the realists ' , or " god's-eye , " view ? that a scientist qua scientist is no one in particular . Such a claim , of course , is identical to Thurber 's claim that " all scientists are the same man . " This creates a knotty problem indeed , one that , I can cheerfully report , our logicians and philosophers are beavering away at ( so I do n't have to ) . What is interesting to me is the rest of the implicit meta72 HARPER 'S / FEBRUARY physics of this passage , the underlying proposition being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , is to be too frightened to know anything about anything . Thurber 's dislike of scientists carried over to the social sciences . He just could n't stand the theoretical generalizing . He once said of writers such as himself : It is difficult for such a person to conform to what Ford Madox Ford in his book of recollections has called the sole reason for writing one 's memoirs : namely , to paint a picture of one 's time . Your short-piece writer 's time is not Walter Lippmann 's time , or Stuart Chase 's time , or Professor Einstein 's time . It is his own personal time , circumscribed by the short boundaries of his pain and embarrassment , in which what happens to his digestion , the rear axle of his car , and the confused flow of his relationships with six or eight persons and two or three buildings is of greater importance than what goes on in the nation or in the universe . Thurber , that is , is someone in particular . This someone in particular is famously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrors in the night , at least when faced with scientific and social advances . But he is not frightened of bloodhounds ! ? which is to say , on Thurber 's own account , not frightened of what may turn out to be demonic , human thought . Remember , he claims that in his work " dogs play the part of intelligence .... " And dogs and intelligence are things that people who are anonymous ? are no one in particular ? are frightened of . hurber battled for space in which he at least . and maybe a few others ( he was no evangelist ) , could be someone in particular . He was passionate enough about the importance of respecting the individual imagination to lay aside humor and fulminate , in a letter to Malcolm Cowley , then the literary editor of the New Republic , about " a desire to subject the individual to the political body , to the economic structure , to put the artist in a uniform so like the uniform of the subway conductor that nobody would be able to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline art ? the art of writing and the art of living ? that some of us are afraid of . Wie need someone to say , listen , you sons of bitches , hands off ? keep your noses in your economic and political dishes or we 'll knock them off ! " It is intelligence , figured as a Thurber hound , that can say , effectively if temporarily , " Hands off ! " to the intruders into one 's particularities in conducting the art of writing and of living . And here we get , I think , the most important clue to Thurber 's refusal to argue in his prose . ( What he did in letters and bars is another matter , and none of our business . ) Instead of debating with the scientists on their " own grounds " about the temperament of the bloodhound , he closes " An Outline of Scientists " this way : I can understand how that big baby dropped the subject of bloodhounds with those few shuddering sentences , but I propose to scare him and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bloodhounds are sometimes put on the trail of old lost ladies or little children who have wandered away from home . When a bloodhound finds an old lady or a little child , he instantly swallows the old lady or little child whole , clothes and all . This is probably what happened to Charlie Ross , Judge Crater , Agnes Tufverson , and a man named Colonel Appel , who disappeared at the battle of Shiloh . God only knows how many thousands of people bloodhounds have swallowed , but it is probably twice as many as the Saint Bernards have swallowed . As everybody knows , the Saint Bernards , when they find travellers fainting in the snow , finish them off . Monks have notoriously little to eat and it stands to reason they could n't feed a lot of big , full-grown Saint Bernards ; hence they sick them on the lost travellers , who would never get anywhere , anyway . The brandy in the little kegs the dogs wear around their necks is used by the Saint Bemards in drunken orgies that follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to the scientists right now , except boo ! Science , philosophy , and the Daughters of the American Revolution have all , to the best of my knowledge , failed to refute Thurber 's boo ! This has to do , I think , with his deep understanding of heroes and with the source of that understanding in his passionate reading of adventure stories . His humor , like all genuine humor , depends not on his being too smart and sophisticated to believe anything but rather on his caring so deeply about the heroic possibilities of the human in a certain tradition ? our tradition . But it is in the dog stories that , to me at least , the possibilities of the quest , the heroic , are clearest . In the piece called " A Snapshot of Rex , " we learn of a bull terrier ( " An American bull terrier none of your English bulls " ) , a dog of the breed that nowadays is usually called the pit bull . Rex was a dignified and powerful dog who seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? well ? taskness to enable him to use himself fully , to bring his heart and mind alive . Rex never started fights . I do n't believe he liked to get into them , despite the fact that he came from a line of fighters . He never went for another dog 's throat but for one of its ears ( that teaches a dog a lesson ) , and he would get his grip , close his eyes , and hold on . He could hold on for hours . His longest fight lasted from dusk until almost pitch-dark , one Sunday . It was fought in East Main Street in Columbus with a large , snarly nondescript that belonged to a big colored man . When Rex finally got his ear grip , the brief whirlwind of snarling turned to screeching . It was frightening to listen to and to watch . The Negro boldly picked the dogs up somehow and began swinging them around his head , and finally let them fly like a hammer in a hammer throw , but although they landed ten feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two dogs eventually worked their way to the middle of the car tracks , and after a while two or three streetcars were held up by the fight . A motorman tried to pry Rex 's jaws open with a switch rod ; somebody lighted a fire and made a torch of a stick and held that to Rex 's tail , but he paid no attention . In the end , all the residents and storekeepers in the neighborhood were on hand , shouting this , suggesting that . Rex 's joy of battle , when battle was joined , was almost tranquil . He had a kind of pleasant expression during fights , not a vicious one , his eyes closed in what would have seemed to be sleep had it not been for the turmoil of the struggle . Rex is n't a bad model for a hero , but someone may be wondering how one distinguishes between Rex and the more hysterical types who are rattling their nuclear and rhetorical toys as a way of distracting our attention from their vanity and greed . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rex did not draft armies and direct them from air-conditioned conference rooms ; he put no one 's life but his own on the line ? and he never started fights . The story ends like this : One of his three masters was not home . He did not get home for an hour . During that hour the bull terrier fought against death as he had fought against the cold , strong current of Alum Creek , as he had fought to climb twelve-foot walls . When the person he was waiting for did come through to inherit him . This may be because to inherit Thurber is to inherit him whole ? dogs , women , and all , and with them the need to understand that all of his heroes are more often ridiculous than they are glorious . For to really understand the hero is to understand the failure of the heroic and manage to love it anyway . His women , for example , are often dangerous , ridiculous , stupid , relentlessly difficult , his " mortal enemies . " And , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ridiculous , once in a while stupid , relentlessly difficult , and sometimes his mortal enemies , as in the story of " The Dog That Bit People . " Muggs was an Airedale ; a " big , burly , choleric dog , he always acted as if he thought I was n't one of the family . There was a slight advantage in being one of the family , for he did n't bite the family as often as he bit strangers . " To try to get the best of Muggs was as hopeless as we know it is for the husband in Men , Women and Dogs to try to get the best of the implacably obnoxious wife to whom the husband is saying , " I assume that you regard yourself as omniscient . If I am wrong , correct me ? " Muggs , like Mame Thurber , could and would get to you whether or not you were reading him as a sweet doggie who only wanted to please . Thurber 's women get to his men and to the reader , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the head and go all weak with sentiment . So I think I would like to end by revealing that when Muggs died , there was written " in indelible pencil " over his grave a single line , " Cave Canem . " This is usually translated into English as " Beware of the dog , " and certain authorities tell me that its meaning may be ambiguous , that it may carry the connotation " Take care of the dog " or " Be careful with the dog . " It quite pleases me to believe this .
