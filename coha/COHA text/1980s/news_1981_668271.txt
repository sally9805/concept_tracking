For Lorraine Chalas this was the longest and frequently loneliest of afternoons as she walked the fairways of the Taconic GC following the progress of a semifinal match in the 73d State Amateur yesterday between Thorny Lea clubmates Bruce Chalas and Steve Tasho . Bruce Chalas , you see , is her husband and Steve Tasho her brother . " I ' ve cried , " she said during the match , " for both of them . " They are also frequent partners on the golf course and , next weekend , they will try to win the Brockton City Fourball championship for the third straight year . Suddenly , in one of the biggest matches of their careers , they were adversaries . " I didn ' t want to play , " said Tasho , " but you have to play . All week , I ' ve been helping him , he ' s been helping me . " As you might have figured , it was a back-and-forth , give-and- take epic , with Chalas coming back from seeming elimination to tie it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away when he three-putted the 18th to send them to the first tee again . When Chalas left his third shot in a trap and wound up with a bogey , Tasho made a four-footer for a winning birdie . So Tasho , a Temple University University golfer from Easton , will meet ageless Fran Quinn of Pleasant Valley , who marched into the finals for the second time with an easy 8 and 6 quarterfinal win over two-time champion Gary Burnett in the morning and a gutsy 1-up semifinal win over Jim Hallet , a Bryant College junior from Bass Rocks and a name to mark down for the future . Twenty-two years ago , Quinn , 43 , appeared in the State Amateur at Taconic as a Holy Cross student and , in the interim , he won the 1966 New England Amateur at Ellington Ridge in Ellington , Conn. , and went to the final of the 1974 State Amateur at Pleasant Valley , losing to Bill Mallon , 4 and 2 . Yesterday he had to phone Rocky Ciociolo , his partner in the Pleasant Valley member-guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening irony to this , " said Quinn between matches yesterday . " In 1966 , when I won the New Englands , I was supposed to play in the Worcester member-guest . I had to cancel . I won my third match , 6 and 5 . I thought this morning , what if I won this , 6 and 5 ? " He went on to beat Hallet , phone the Pleasant Valley pro shop and found out Ciociolo , playing alone , had won their first-round match . Chalas , who eliminated Jim Peace of nearby Wyantenuck in the morning , 3 and 1 , had a basic approach to Taconic . " If you can drive the ball and make par , you ' ll wear these guys down . " What he did against Tasho was to drive it well for nine holes , make nine straight pars and take a two-up lead to the 10th tee . " I washed my ball , " he said , " and my legs felt weak . I said , Man , I ' m out of gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next six holes and Tasho , who had put out defending champion Jim McDermott of Fall River in the quarterfinals , 4 and 2 , won four of the first five to take a two-up lead to the 15th tee . Here he left the door ajar after Chalas had knocked his second shot deeper into trouble . " I was over the ball , " said Tasho , " and my mind went blank . " He scrubbed it to the right and they halved the hole with bogeys . Chalas proceded to get a second wind and win the 16th with a 3- foot par putt and the 17th with a tap-in par after Tasho had pushed his tee shot on the par-3 hole far to the right and bogeyed . On the 18th , Chalas left his five- wood second shot " in right field , " wedged it to the edge of the green and missed from 12 feet above the hole . They went to the 19th where it ended . " It was a long day , " said Lorraine Chalas . Hallet , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , quickly went two-down to two Quinn birdies and was looking at a three-down situation when he pushed his tee shot into an embankment on the 4th . Forced to take a baseball-type swipe at the ball that was knee high , he gouged a seven iron over a large willow tree to the green and wound up winning the hole . After that , few exchanges and , when Hallet won the 14th with a par , the match was even . But Quinn made a delicate par putt for a halve on the 16th andwent one-up when Hallet landed in a trap on the 17th . On the 18th , Hallet came off a three iron and eventually conceded to a par . So it is Tasho and Quinn today in a scheduled 36- hole championship as Quinn bids to become the oldest state amateur champion since Mike Ohanian of Oakley in 1968.
