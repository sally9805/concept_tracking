txt THOSE WHO THINK that the nation 's personal weaitn is soumg inexorably south toward cities like Orlando , Fla. , Dallas and Phoenix . Ariz. , ought to glance at a new survey by Sales &; Marketing Management magazine . Five years from now , the magazine says , the big consumer bucks will be right where they are now , in such decidedly un-Sun Belt locales as Nassau County , N.Y. ; Stamford . Conn. ; Lake County , Ill. , and Newark , N.J. No , the last entry is not a typographical error . We are n't talking here about enclaves of the super-rich , out rather communities with big numbers of relatively well-off people . The sort of locales that a lot of retailers look 11 for in planning future growth . Using income and population growth figures for the past five 1 jili years , the magazine 's survey lists what it ex-pects will be the 50 most affluent metropolitan markets in 1987 . HEADING THE AFFLUENCE LIST is Nassau-Suffolk , N.Y. , the two-county metropolitan area that covers almost all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast , will have 2 . T million people in 1987 with an effective annual buying income of $64,145 per household . ( Buying income is personal income less taxes and other payments . ) Second on the list is Lake County , Ill. , which includes Lake Forest and other upper-income communities north of Chicago . Nos. 3 to 10 are : Midland ; **35;1253;TOOLONG , Conn. ; Anchorage , Alaska ; **28;1290;TOOLONG counties , N.J. ; Washington , D.C. ; Bergen-Passaic counties , N.J. ; Newark , and Anaheim-Santa Ana Note first that these markets are predominantly suburban . Everyone talks about the Frost Belt hurting , but that 's the central car ies . The suburbs are holding up well . The cream is still there , " says Thayer Taylor , the magazine 's senior survey editor . ALSO , AFFLUENT SUBURBS large enough to qualify as separate metropolitan areas tend to be clustered around older , big cities . New York City , for example , has lots of poor people so it falls far down the affluence scale , but its upper-middle-class suburbs rate near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad-based affluence , despite its image of great oil-based personal wealth . Surveys such as this one usually use the federal government 's list of metropolitan areas , which explains Newark 's high ranking . Newark , by government definition , includes not only the blighted central city across the Hudson River from New York , but also four surrounding counties full of comfortable suburbs . David Wyss , vice president of the Lexington , Mass. , economic consulting firm Data Resources Inc. , says this sort of list is useful " if you 're looking for lots of people with lots of money . " If there 's a loophole , it 's that the future trends are predicted solely on past performance . " We assume everything will stay the same . It 's a trap every forecaster runs into , " says Mr. Taylor . It also leads to a few shaky predictions , such as assuming that the citizens of Midland , who grew wealthy in the 1970s because their town was the center of the West Texas oil boom , will amass wealth at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession . It 's a dangerous assumption , says Mr. Wyss . " It requires more faith than I have . " Land in Appalachia Lacks Local Control westerners never tire of pointing out that Uncle Sam is the West 's biggest landowner . In no Rocky Mountain or West Coast state does the federal government control less than one-quarter of the land . About 96% of Alaska and 85% of Nevada are government owned . In the East , Maine residents have learned to live in the shadow of a half-dozen paper companies with huge landholdings . Great Northern Paper Co. alone owns 2.1 million acres of Maine timberland , or 11% of that state . In other regions , landownership is n't so clear cut . Figuring out who owns what , especially in parts of the country where courthouse records and tax files are spotty , can be like assembling a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces missing . The rural , coal-mining counties of Appalachia may be the toughest region of all to document , but a citizens task force has given it a good try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appalachia " ( University Press of Kentucky , 235 pages , $25 . ) While some readers may quarrel with the conclusion that East Tennessee could benefit from Latin American-style land reform , it 's difficult to ignore the concentration of wealth and landholdings uncovered by the survey . Among the findings : Slightly more than half the 13 million acres of surface area surveyed is owned by 1% of the local population plus a small number of corporations , government agencies and absentee owners . About 80% of seven million acres of mineral rights in the 80 counties are absentee owned . Has the lack of local control of the land contributed to Appalachia 's backwardness , as the book suggests ? Judge for yourself .
