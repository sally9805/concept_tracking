' ' We ' re hoping this will spread , ' ' says Mr. McCloskey with enthusiasm . ' ' We ' re hoping this will become a chain-letter-type deal. ' ' // At the Sierra Club ' s rambling Capitol Hill digs , as in interest-group offices all across town , it ' s time to gear up for the election-year offensive . As the November contest approaches , lobbyists are planning to make pet issues more visible , and plotting how to win influence by delivering votes. // Sierra officials , for example , say acid rain is going to be at the center of their organizing efforts . Their other political activities range from providing a shrimp chef for a candidate ' s fund-raising dinner to helping Sierra Club members become delegates at the national conventions. // ' ' We ' re going to be working hard in key states to make a difference in how the vote goes , ' ' says McCloskey , who with his horn-rimmed glasses and gray suit could pass for a Boston banker. // Founded in 1892 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups in the United States . The environment as a cause , however , tends to attract more zeal than money , and Sierra is not rich by Washington interest-group standards. // The Sierra Club Political Action Committee , for instance , contributed about $230 , 000 to candidates in 1982 . The PAC of the National Association of Realtors , the J. Paul Getty of lobbies , spent $2. 3 million in the same period. // Sierra ' s effect on the ' 84 elections - and the political benefits it may reap in return - will thus depend on the effort it can muster , instead of cash . In this it is similar to dozens of often-liberal public-interest lobbies such as the Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign and the National Organization for Women. // ' ' We have to use what we ' ve got , which is people , ' ' says David Gardiner , Sierra ' s Washington , D.C. , legislative director. // From 1980 to 1983 , former Interior Secretary James G. Watt - the environmentalists ' archfoe - helped keep the Sierra Club ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the group ' s membership doubled , to 365 , 000. // With Mr. Watt out of office , Sierra officials are hoping that acid rain will in effect take his place. // ' ' This is the issue we think best symbolizes this administration ' s failure to come to grips with our environmental needs , ' ' director McCloskey says. // Environmentalists say pollutants from coal-burning Midwest power plants are causing acid rain to fall on the Eastern US . The White House contends that it ' s not yet clear who is causing the problem , and thus it won ' t back bills to make utilities install expensive cleanup equipment. // So the Sierra Club , in concert with the National Audubon Society and other environmental groups , is trying to stir up grass-roots concern . In hopes of flooding Congress with mail , the groups are distributing thousands of ' ' STOP ACID RAIN ' ' post cards to members and other interested parties. // The post cards have a dual purpose . As well as making the acid rain issue more visible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental issues - the raw material of ' ' people power , ' ' Sierra ' s Gardiner says. // These lists of sympathizers will be an invaluable aid in one of Sierra ' s main political activities - helping favored congressional candidates. // So far this year , the Sierra Club has given its seal of approval to 45 candidates for the House or Senate . More endorsements are sure to come . In 1982 , 180 politicians received the Sierra nod . ( About two-thirds won. ) // Not all endorsees will get environmentalist help in their campaigns . Some have safe seats ; some have no chance . Others are running in major media markets , such as New York , where the Sierra Club can ' t make much difference. // And those that do receive aid don ' t get much of it in cash . Sierra this year plans to donate about $250 , 000 in cash or political services ( such as canvassing ) to candidates , political director Holly Schadler says. // But they will get another kind of political currency - volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund-raisers . In ' 82 , New Mexico senatorial candidate Jeff Bingaman had 600 environmental workers , Ms. Schadler says ; Sen. Robert Stafford ( R ) of Vermont had 150 , plus Robert Redford radio commercials sponsored by the League of Conservation Voters. // ' ' The senator said that his reelection was contingent on the help he got from environmentalists and educators , ' ' says Stafford aide Victor Maerki. // Rep. Les AuCoin ( D ) of Oregon , a vocal opponent of James Watt ' s mineral-leasing policies , is facing a tough battle this year and is already receiving environmentalists ' organizing help. // ' ' The Sierra Club is cosponsoring one of our largest fund-raisers - a $25-a-head shrimp feed , ' ' says Kevin Smith , Mr. AuCoin ' s campaign manager . ' ' Their regional director is going to be chef. ' ' // The Sierra Club , of course , is not doing this just for the sheer pleasure of participating in democracy. // Members hope their involvement in congressional campaigns ( local chapters also work on local races ) will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts. // ' ' The relationships that are built in a campaign can be very valuable later , in lobbying , ' ' says Ms. Schadler. // The Sierra Club is also involved in the presidential race , but in a rather novel way. // In conjunction with the League of Conservation Voters ( LCV ) , Sierra taught many of its members how to get chosen as delegates to the national conventions. // In 14 states , Sierra or LCV operatives held seminars in political strategy , complete with Republican and Democratic officials explaining caucus procedures . About 100 card-carrying environmentalists were elected or chosen as presidential delegates this year , Ms. Schadler says ; another 100 or so have pledged to participate in an environmental caucus. // Most of these people are Democrats . Two delegates on the Democratic Platform Committee , in fact , are Sierra Club members. // Environmentalists hope the Democratic platform will address three specific issues : acid rain ; more cash for the Superfund toxic-waste cleanup program ; and faster movement to protect wilderness areas. // For most of its 90-plus years of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , 1982 was the first year it officially endorsed congressional candidates. // But involvement in campaigns is proving very popular among the rank and file , Sierra officials say . Each of Sierra ' s 53 chapters has its own SCCOPE ( Sierra Club Committee on Political Education ) ; 23 have their own PACs. // Local members can endorse and help people running for all types of local office . Ann Timberlake , head of Sierra ' s South Carolina chapter , says her group works for county council candidates , as well as those running for Congress. // ' ' I think it ' s extremely beneficial , ' ' she says . ' ' It has helped our members have more realistic expectations about people in politics. ' ' // //
