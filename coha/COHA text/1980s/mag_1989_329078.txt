NICE WORK by David Lodge ; Viking ; 277 pages ; $18.95 <P> If English movies of the ' 80s had a team like Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn , David Lodge 's funny , adroit Nice Work would make an ideal vehicle for them . The novel 's protagonist , Vic Wilcox , is a gruff but keen-witted exec struggling to turn around a laggard steel-parts factory in Rummidge  --  " an imaginary city , " the author informs us , " which occupies , for the purposes of fiction , the space where Birmingham is to be found on maps of the so-called real world . " Vic 's antagonist ( and here the term is literal ) is Robyn Penrose , an attractive , rigorously feminist lecturer in literature at the local university  --  a specialist in the 19th century industrial novel , no less . To bolster her chance of a permanent appointment , Robyn goes along with a university scheme to shadow Vic 's movements for one day a week in the interests of better academic-industrial understanding . The result : temperaments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blooms . Wittily rueful insights emerge . <P> All of which is predictable  --  but not too predictable . Lodge is a writer who seems to favor schematic setups precisely because they enable him to play sly variations on the formulas . Left-wing Robyn , for example , decries Vic 's factory as a hellish model of capitalism in extremis and dismisses his maneuvers against rival companies as " a lot of little dogs squabbling over bones . " Yet while tagging along to a trade show in Frankfurt , she ca n't resist helping him bring off a negotiating coup for a piece of automatic machinery that will replace several workers . Vic charges that Robyn 's scholarly concerns have no place on society 's balance sheet and that the university 's elitism violates her own populist ideals . Yet he soon starts turning up on campus , helping Robyn 's faculty committee reorganize a syllabus and shyly thumbing a volume of Tennyson in one of her tutorials . <P> Lodge takes care to keep these two evenly matched , each as disconcertingly perceptive and sweetly ridiculous as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighthearted aggressor and Vic who , after spending a single night with her , turns into a love-sick calf and begins making alarming declarations about leaving his " podge " of a wife . Robyn , ever the teacher , expounds poststructuralist literary theory to him in bed , explaining that what he mistakes for love is merely a rhetorical device , a bourgeois fallacy . " Have n't you ever been in love , then ? " he asks . " When I was younger , " she replies , " I allowed myself to be constructed by the discourse of romantic love for a while , yes . "
