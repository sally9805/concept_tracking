The Post spurns p. r. " wolves " <P> Reporters often rely on publicists to alert them to stories , but customarily dismiss the public relations trade as " flackery . " They especially bridle at the notion that p.r . agencies offer clients " influence " or " access " to news organizations ; journalists consider themselves open to anyone with a story or a complaint . <P> Resentment reached the flash point with Washington Post Editorial Page Editor Meg Greenfield when she " looked at the disaster area that is my desk and saw that everything on it had two or three p.r . firms ' names on the letterhead . " Greenfield sent a fiery memo to Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee . " We do n't want any of that damned crowd around here , " she wrote . " If people want to get to us ... it 's as easy as pie , so long as they do n't come in ( or send their manuscripts in or make a request ) via a flack firm . The reason for saying no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we be in their goddamn memo traffic as exploitable or exploited ' resources ' ? " <P> Bradlee wrote his own spirited endorsement to managing and assistant managing editors . Said he : " If college presidents want to talk to us they should call us , and not be charged for arranging an interview by some public relations firm . " He added what appeared to be an outright Post-wide ban : " Please be sure that all reporters and assignment editors understand what we 're talking about . We will not be a party to political interviews , or really any interviews , set up by professional public relations firms . " <P> Soon after , copies of Greenfield 's and Bradlee 's notes leaked to Washington p.r . agencies . Threatened with a loss of mystique and livelihood , the firms bombarded the Post with protests . Privately , some claimed that since the capital became a one-newspaper town with the death of the Washington Star last August , the Post has grown increasingly arrogant-and , in this case , impractical . One senior p.r . man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians and Government agencies , routinely deals with press officers and administrative aides . " Everyone in this business has to deal with intermediaries , " he said . " Ronald Reagan could call them any time he wants to , but you know he wo n't . " <P> By week 's end both Bradlee and Greenfield were backing off . Bradlee said that he meant only to stress that " no one has to hire a rainmaker to see us " ; he waffled when asked whether the Post really meant to refuse all interviews set up by p.r . firms . Indeed , speaking for the feature sections , Bradlee said , " We will take all calls . " Greenfield insisted that she had wanted only to keep her opinion pages " Caesar 's wife-ish " and open to all comers . Added she : " It was not my intention to direct this to the news side .
