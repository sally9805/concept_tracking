The report quoted discussions about threatening President Oscar Arnulfo Arias of Costa Rica with a cutoff of aid if he publicly a secret airstrip built for the rebels. // Although the report said the commission could find no evidence that President Reagan ever approved a plan to aid the rebels , known as contras , it quoted documents suggesting that Mr. Reagan knew about at least some of the activities . In addition to Costa Rica , efforts to assist the contras drew in Taiwan . South Korea , Guatemala , Chile , Israel and Saudi Arabia. // One memo said the President was told about plans to organize a legal defense for an American captured in the downing of a supply plane in Nicaragua last year . <> <> Disclosures on Contra Aid // Turning to the arms sales to Iran that are said to have provided money for the contra effort , the report said the United States was receiving intelligence about Iranian terrorist activities planned against the United States as Robert C. McFarlane , the former national security adviser , was preparing to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A9 . Among the report ' s disclosures about aid to the contras are these : // * The White House approached an unidentified country to supply British antiaircraft missiles to the contras . Sources familiar with the document identified the country as Chile . The request came just a few months before the State Department accused Chile of human rights violations. // * The President of an unidentified Central American country and one of its generals provided " extraordinary assistance " in getting $8 million in weapons to the contras in 1985 , according to a memo by Lieut . Col. Oliver L. North ( Section C , Part III of the report ) . Other sources said that the nation was Guatemala , and that shortly before the general signed the false documentation for the weapons , the White House sought to increase aid to Guatemala to $35 million from $300 , 000. // * The report disclosed that Israel was offering to send military advisers to the contras if the United States approved an attempt by Israel to sell fighter planes to Honduras . There was a dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to his superior , Vice Adm . John M. Poindexter , that the threat to the Costa Rican President went " well beyond my charter in dealing w/ a head of state this way and in making threats/offers that may be impossible to deliver . " Costa Rica ' s Ambassador , Guido Fernandez , said today that he did not believe the call ever took place . Elliott Abrams , Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs , echoed that comment in his testimony before the commission . At the time , Admiral Poindexter wrote to Colonel North : " You did the right thing , but let ' s try to keep it quiet. " // * The report disclosed that Admiral Poindexter told Robert M. Gates , the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence , of plans to " phase out " the private network , a comment that suggests he was aware of its existence and connection to the White House . Mr. Gates is now the nominee to become Director of Central Intelligence. // * According to the report , about $30 million was provided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds " of a foreign official . The report based that finding on testimony by Mr. McFarlane and two other officials . A source familiar with the testimony said the money was from the royal family of Saudi Arabia. // * The report cited a letter dated April 18 , 1985 , with handwritten notations by Colonel North , naming benefactors to the contras . Among those named were Andy Messing Jr. , and Linda Guell , leaders of conservative public-policy groups , and John Hull , an American landowner in Costa Rica. // Documents gathered for the report suggest that senior officials , including Admiral Poindexter , were kept fully informed by Colonel North of his efforts to aid the contras during a period of Congressional curbs . What the President Knew There were at least three references to President Reagan ' s knowledge of the efforts to aid the contras . On May 16 , 1986 , Colonel North wrote to Admiral Poindexter , " I have no idea what Don Regan does or does not know re my private U.S. operation but the President obviously knows why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their support for Democracy in Centam. " // In another memo , dated June 10 , 1986 , Colonel North wrote that an effort should be made to get antiaircraft missiles from an allied goverment , and he adds , " I would love to carry the letter from RR , " an apparent reference to Ronald Reagan. // Finally , a week after the supply plane was shot down in Nicaragua Oct. 5 , Mr. North wrote of his success in obtaining a $100 , 000 donation for the legal defense of the surviving crewman . " RR was briefed that this plan was being contemplated before he left for Iceland , " Colonel North wrote. // One of the disclosures in the report is the extent to which Mr. McFarlane , the former national security adviser , continued to assist Colonel North with the contra issue well after he resigned in December 1985. // On April 4 , 1986 , for instance , Mr. McFarlane asked Colonel North to have the C.I.A. identify all the countries to which the British have sold Blowpipe antiaircraft missiles . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " he wrote in a computer message. // The Tower report describes in some detail the Administration ' s fund-raising efforts for the contras in unidentified foreign countries . It quotes Mr. McFarlane , for instance , as saying that one foreign donor gave $1 million a month beginning in mid-1985 and later increased this contribution to $2 million a month . Sources familiar with the report said this was a reference to Saudi interests with links to the Government. // Under the 1986 law governing the contras , it was permissible for the State Department to raise money for humanitarian assistance and Department officials said they took care to approach countries that were not dependent on American aid or well known for human rights violations. // The National Security Council staff apparently took no such precautions in its dealings with foreign governments . On Feb. 6 , 1985 , for instance , Colonel North asked Mr. McFarlane to approve a plan for using a retired military officer , Maj. Gen. John Singlaub , to tell two unidentified countries " to proceed with their offer . " The countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South Korea. // In addition to Costa Rica and Guatemala , countries with growing ties to the United States , Israeli officials were approached for aid . Israel is this country ' s largest single recipient of foreign aid. // Admiral Poindexter was informed of all these efforts by Colonel North , who asked in June 1986 whether he should inform Secretary of State George P. Shultz . Admiral Poindexter replied : " To my knowledge , Secretary Shultz knows nothing about prior financing . I think it should stay that way . " Details on Elliott Abrams The report provides the most detailed account to date of the involvement of Mr. Abrams , the State Department official responsible for Central America , in efforts to aid the contras . It says , for instance , that Mr. Abrams was part of a small cadre of officials from different agencies who were encouraging Ambassador Lewis A. Tambs in Costa Rica to open a southern front for the contras. // The report quoted the C.I.A. station chief in Costa Rica as having said that he was startled when Mr. Abrams mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he knew Colonel North was connected to the airstrip , but did not know how. //
