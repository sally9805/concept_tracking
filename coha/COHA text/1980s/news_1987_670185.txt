U.S. wheat futures prices soared amid wild speculation that the Soviet Union wants to buy as much as 4. 7 million metric tons , or 172. 5 million bushels , of wheat under a U.S. export-promotion program . And wheat as well as corn and soybean prices are expected to rise further when the futures markets open today , in response to the Agriculture Department ' s reduction late yesterday of its estimate of U.S. stockpiles . U.S. wheat prices have risen for several weeks , partly in response to speculation that poor weather has hurt the Soviet crop and that the Soviets might buy U.S. grain in order to smooth over relations with the U.S. The Soviet Union angered some U.S. trade officials when it failed to comply with a trade agreement to buy at least nine million metric tons of U.S. grain for the year ended Sept. 30 . Prices surged yesterday in response to remarks at a news conference in Washington by Thomas Kay , administrator of the Agriculture Department ' s Foreign Agricultural Service . The U.S. , Mr. Kay said , hopes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets in the next 12 months , the last year of its long-term grain agreement with the Soviet Union . However , Mr. Kay , who had just returned from talks in Moscow , said Soviet officials gave him the impression that the U.S. once again will have to resort to " export enhancement , " a euphemism for subsidies , to obtain large Soviet wheat orders . The Soviets , Mr. Kay said , indicated they " would not be disappointed " if the U.S. would sell them wheat at world market prices , which are expected to be considerably lower than U.S. prices , and then reimburse U.S. grain-exporting firms for the difference . Mr. Kay said the Soviet Union plans to buy 65 , 000 tons of U.S. grain to test a new fumigation technique designed to kill the insect larva it claims often infest U.S. shipments . Several traders interpreted the move as a signal that the Soviets are laying plans for a major U.S. order . At the Moscow talks earlier this week , Mr. Kay said , he complained about the Soviets ' failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had ample supplies of corn and that U.S. soybean prices weren ' t competitive , he said . " We indicated we would do our best to be competitive , " Mr. Kay said . No immediate surge in Soviet grain buying is in sight , however . The Agriculture Department , in a report issued yesterday , increased its forecast of the Soviet grain crop to 210 million metric tons , up five million tons from last month ' s estimate . If the latest forecast holds , the Soviet harvest would match the 1986 crop , the largest since 1978 . The department also estimated yesterday that in the 1987-1988 crop year the Soviets would import just 28 million metric tons of grain , the lowest amount in nine years . Many analysts have expected recent bad weather in the Soviet Union to force it to increase foreign purchases . Many futures traders interpreted Mr. Kay ' s remarks as a signal that the Soviets are laying plans for a major U.S. order . Wheat futures prices rose to a fourmonth high before easing slightly . Wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $3. 0425 a bushel , up 7. 25 cents . Yesterday ' s rally was the second jump in wheat futures recently . Earlier this month a rally was sparked by an Agriculture Department report showing a 6% drop from a year earlier in the nation ' s wheat stockpiles . Some , though , doubted the speculation about a major Soviet purchase . " I just can ' t really believe it , " said Victor Lespinasse , a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago . And many analysts said they would be surprised if the Soviets show any interest in buying more than a few million metric tons of U.S. wheat any time soon . " I ' d say there is a good chance that the Soviets will come to the U.S. , " said Jonathan Will , a grain analyst at Cargill Investor Services in Chicago . However , it is too early in the season for Moscow to estimate its needs for the coming year , he said . After the close of trading yesterday , the Agriculture Department released its monthly estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop conditions . Among other things , the department trimmed its estimate of the stockpiles that will result from this year ' s harvest . The corn stockpile projected for September of next year , for example , was cut to 4. 4 billion bushels from an earlier estimate of 4. 56 billion bushels . In other futures markets yesterday : STOCK INDEXES : Wednesday ' s respite gave way to Thursday ' s rout as the stock and stock-index futures markets plunged in active trading . Stock-index futures prices plummeted because of concerns about higher interest rates and a weaker dollar , analysts said , and the downward slide may have further to go . " Fear of rising interest rates in Japan and that the Federal Reserve Board may raise the discount rate " drove prices lower , said Courtney Smith , vice president futures and options trading at Banque Paribas in New York . Falling Treasury bond futures prices and sharply higher foreign currency futures prices added downward pressure on index futures prices . " We ' re trading off the interest rate markets , and the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Although index futures prices rallied off the session ' s lows as traders bought back contracts they had sold " short " earlier , genuine buying interest was practically non-existent , an analyst said . PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices rose amid continued softness in the dollar and a weak bond market . Chart-guided technical buying accelerated the advances , traders said . However , some analysts said the precious metal markets probably will remain locked in a narrow trading range . " We still haven ' t seen any pickup in the cash market , and there ' s a dearth of investment interest , " one analyst said . COTTON : Futures prices eased slightly ahead of the release of an Agriculture Department forecast after the close of trading . The department predicted that production for the season that began Aug. 1 would total more than 13. 3 million bales , up from the projection last month of 12. 8 million bales . The production estimate was slightly higher than most private estimates , analysts said . The department expects stockpiles at the end of the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3. 5 million bales estimate in the September report , but down from the five million bales at the beginning of the season . Export sales showed no change . ORANGE JUICE : Futures prices rose in quiet activity as traders waited for the Agriculture Department ' s first estimate of the next Florida orange crop . The report was released after trading ended . The department predicted that , for the season that will begin Dec. 1 , Florida will produce 130 million boxes of oranges , compared with 119. 7 million boxes in the last crop . A box weighs 90 pounds . Traders and analysts expected an estimate between 125 million and 140 million boxes . The government expects a per-box yield of 1. 46 gallons , compared with 1. 51 gallons for the last crop . Based on the standard rate of 80% of the crop being processed into juice , Florida should pack about 151. 8 million gallons next season , compared with 145. 1 this season , said Judy Weissman , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York . Since consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase during the season , with favorable weather Florida should produce more juice than initially indicated , Miss Weissman said .
