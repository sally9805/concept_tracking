URBAN COWBOY Directed by James Bridges Screenplay by James Bridges and Aaron Latham <P> Urban Cowboy is one of those movies that are all packaging and no execution . To put the matter more harshly , the elements that must have made it commercially attractive to its producers , and surely built up the public 's anticipation of it , have been distorted and attenuated to the point of extinction as the picture developed . <P> What everyone obviously hoped for was a film that would do for country-and-western music what Saturday Night Fever did for the disco craze-make a lively , gritty comment on it and earn big bucks too . Like Fever , Urban Cowboy is based on a magazine article ( by Co-Scenarist Aaron Latham ) . The same star , John Travolta , has been recruited to play the lead . <P> There all resemblance ends . The music , which is the heart of both phenomena , serves Cowboy mainly as a banal background , not as the dramatic center - the justification really-for the characters ' lives . Director James Bridges , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syndrome , does not bring to his realization of the C. and W. scene anything like the dynamic energy , the sheer stylistic force with which John Badham drove Fever . Finally , the electric charge that Travolta jolted into that film is missing here . If he keeps on this way , he will turn out to be not the Brando of the ' 80s but the Troy Donahue of the decade . <P> The trouble with Urban Cowboy is that Bridges and Latham have not devised a dramatic structure faithful to the reality Latham reported with spare detachment in his article in Esquire mag azine . Their story is at once too melodramatic , too romantic and sentimental to be believed . <P> The main location is Gilley 's , a sprawling honky-tonk near Houston , which features country music in an allegedly volatile atmosphere . It provides the emotional center for the lives of some of the working-class population of that booming and still settling American city . Bridges ' version of the action at Gilley 's is strangely soft .

He said it offered hardhats from the nearby refineries a chance to escape from their harsh , boring , workaday reality into a fantasy that was simultaneously readymade and hand-me-down . Duding up each night in western duds that no working cowboy would ever wear , the clock punchers also slip into a set of values that are as impractical for modern urban life as a pair of chaps . For a little while each night in Gilley 's , they can play at being tough loners who like their whisky rough and their women silent , pliable and indifferent to indifference . <P> At the heart of this weird scene stands a mechanical bull that bucks and cork screws in a very good approximation of a real rodeo bull . Riding it , the urban cow boy literally risks his manhood and , of course , gains the admiring attention of the urban cowgirls . Some of them also try their luck on this contraption and this threatens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
