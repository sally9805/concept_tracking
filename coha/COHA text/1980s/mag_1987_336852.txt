Shortly after African National Congress Leader Govan Mbeki was set free this month , a group of his supporters held a rally at Johannesburg 's Khotso House , headquarters of a dozen antiapartheid groups . Only a year earlier , white occupants of an apartment house across the street had caused a minor riot at the same spot by tossing flowerpots and other missiles onto the crowd from their balconies . This time curious residents again peered from their balconies , but no one down below thought of ducking . Even though the apartment building is restricted by law to whites only , most of the onlookers were black . <P> With gathering speed , yet another of apartheid 's pillars  --  the mandatory residential separation of the races  --  is crumbling . Especially in Johannesburg but also in other large cities , neighborhoods that were once entirely white are seeing a steady influx of ethnic Asians , " coloreds " ( people of mixed race ) , and , most surprisingly , blacks . The migration to these so-called gray areas is taking place in violation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigning every square foot of South Africa to residential use by one of the four racial groups and , when passed in 1950 , was hailed by Prime Minister Daniel F. Malan as the " essence of apartheid . " Though the present government of State President P.W . Botha insists that the law remain on the books , authorities do virtually nothing to enforce it . <P> The unraveling of the Group Areas Act began in 1982 , when the Transvaal supreme court ruled that an Indian found to be in violation of the law could not be evicted from her home unless authorities could prove the " availability of alternative accommodation . " That was  --  and still is  --  an impossible task . Severe overcrowding plagues most nonwhite areas , which contain 73% of the country 's total population but cover only 13% of its land . In the black township of Soweto , outside Johannesburg , for example , the typical four-room " shoe box " home is occupied by an average of 16 people . <P> As increasing numbers of whites moved to the suburbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by law , could be sold or rented only to other whites . As recently as last year , this white flight had left at least one apartment out of four in central Johannesburg unoccupied , and surplus housing nationwide reached a total of 37,000 units . Market forces gradually overcame legal ones , and whites began renting to nonwhites , often with the assistance of real estate agents who specialize in " C.I.A . listings , " a coy abbreviation for " colored , Indian and African . " In Johannesburg the largest concentrations of nonwhites have settled in the downtown business area and a midtown neighborhood called Hillbrow , which now has a 40% black population of about 35,000 . " What is happening in Johannesburg is not an issue of political defiance but a case of necessity , " says Tony Leon , a city councilor who represents a gray section of Hillbrow . " These people have nowhere else to go . "
