Despite a dictatorship , Chile 's " Chicago Boys " make good <P> Chile , " says a U.S. State Department ' official grudgingly , " is a casebook study in sound economic management . " Chile ? The country where two months ago the Catholic Church demanded an investigation into the identities of more than 300 bodies found crammed into unmarked coffins in a Santiago cemetery ? Chile ? The international pariah that refuses to extradite to the U.S. the former head of the Chilean secret service and two other army officers indicted for murder by a federal grand jury ? Yes , Chile , where Military Dictator Augusto Pinochet is simultaneously tightening his grip on the government and freeing up the economy . <P> Today a six-block stretch of Calle Ahumada in Santiago is one of South America 's busiest commercial malls . Brightly painted signs pull shoppers into new boutiques stuffed with madras dresses from India , art supplies from Germany and motorcycles from Japan . The adjoining streets are jammed with honking hordes of shiny cars and trucks of every modern make . Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , La Moneda palace , where Pinochet 's predecessor , Marxist Salvador Allende , was killed in 1973 , remains begrimed and run down . <P> Repressive political regimes do not normally dictate laissez-faire economic systems , but that is what is happening in Chile . The result is that inflation , which was as high as 1,000% in 1973 , has been beaten back to about 38% . Real growth spurted 7.3% in 1978 and rose another 7.5% or so last year . Per capita income is up to $1,500 ; in real terms , the people are at least back around the income levels of 1970 . That was when Allende was elected and began to crank up the printing presses to cover spiraling government deficits that led to economic disaster . <P> Chile 's economy , which was highly protected under Allende , has become much less restricted and more entrepreneurial . The transformation has been largely the work of those whom Chileans call the " Chicago Boys , " a handful of officials and academics led by Planning Minister Miguel Kast , 30 , Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Alvaro Bardon , 39 . All have graduate degrees in economics from the University of Chicago , the spiritual home of Free Marketeer Milton Friedman . Like most Chilean economists , the Boys were fervent opponents of Allende , and the military junta picked many of them for top jobs . They were given broad authority to cope with emergency in 1975 , when the country lay in ruins , hammered by three blows in succession . First there was the economic chaos that preceded and immediately followed Allende 's bloody ouster , then the surge in oil prices , and finally the collapse of the price of copper , which accounted for more than 80% of Chile 's exports .
