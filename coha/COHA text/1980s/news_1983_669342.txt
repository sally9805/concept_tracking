Sounds like a great opportunity for any United States company . But it takes time and patience to strike a deal with a country not used to capitalist business practices. // In AMC ' s case , it took four years . But in the process ' ' we learned a lot , ' ' Mr. Gilchrist recalls at AMC headquarters here. // Gilchrist , who looks somewhat boyish with his red cheeks and light hair , is manager of the company ' s Far East operations. // Last month , in Peking ' s Great Hall of the People and in the midst of much ceremony and honor , AMC officials signed a joint-venture contract with Beijing Automotive Works . AMC is putting $8 million in cash and $8 million worth of technology into the joint venture , which will make it one-third owner of Beijing Jeep Corporation , the new name for the operation . AMC will now provide components to upgrade a four-wheel-drive vehicle already being manufactured at the Peking plant . Later , Beijing Jeep will manufacture a version of the AMC Jeep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // For AMC the four years - one of them a waiting period while China reorganized its ministerial structure - were full of surprises. // ' ' The areas where we expected traditionally to have the biggest problems went surprisingly smoothly , ' ' adds Tod Clare , vice-president for international operations . ' ' The areas where we expected almost a routine treatment turned out to be rather difficult ones . ' ' The AMC executives tick off a couple of contract clauses that are standard in ventures like this one , such as for force majeure ( floods , earthquakes , or unusual economic conditions , etc. , that make it impossible to live up to a contract ) and arbitration . ' ' With the Chinese , we spent a lot of time talking about clauses that are standard everyplace . Arbitration was a big , big issue - in terms of what steps you go through. // ' ' When you get the first two-thirds of a contract done , the last third is usually simple . In this case we never knew where we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gilchrist. // AMC had also entered the negotiations with a rough contract outline , drawn from other joint ventures . But the US executives found that the more they pursued their outline , the more difficult negotiations became. // ' ' The Chinese were having a terrible time going to our format , ' ' Gilchrist recounts . ' ' The first breakthrough we made was when we threw ( our outline ) away and started going with their format . We tried to introduce our ideas within their format and we stopped trying to force our own outline . . . . ' ' // Another sticky point : trademarks . Mr. Clare explained that Chinese use the word ' ' jeep ' ' generically - just as many Americans use the word ' ' xerox ' ' to describe photocopying . ' ' We were very , very protective of the Jeep trademark . . . . The Chinese had a difficult time understanding what the issue was , ' ' he explains . It took almost three years to register the Jeep trademark in China. // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of a trademark , ' ' Clare adds. // On the other hand , he recalls , the Chinese made no issue of assets , a subject that can end up in long debate . Clare admits he thought negotiations would run into trouble when AMC discovered the company would end up with some assets it didn ' t want , such as a downtown service department . ' ' But the Chinese said , ' Oh , don ' t worry , we ' ll just lump that together and put it over here , and you can rent it for 20 years , ' ' ' Clare continues , ' ' so the assets that were ( finally included ) ended up being the percentage we wanted . . . . Something like that would have been a big problem anywhere else in the world. ' ' // The AMC executives said they had to adjust to a number of Chinese characteristics . One was attention to detail . ' ' In negotiating , some ( Chinese officials ) were very conservative , they didn ' t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The negotiations were often hung up ' ' on some unimportant word translation. ' ' // The American executives were also surprised by the Chinese insistence on a detailed , seven-year financial feasibility plan . Clare says AMC normally plans three years out , and adds a couple of years of ' ' crude ' ' guesswork . ' ' I felt rather uncomfortable about that ( seven-year plan ) , because that ' s really getting into the unknown. // ' ' But they wanted seven years . We did seven years and we did an intelligent job with it , ' ' Clare adds . ' ' And as you look back , it ' s rather comforting to see the seven-year story in front of you. ' ' // The long-term plan is just the tip of the central-planning iceberg in China . According to the AMC executives , everything from sales to energy consumption at the plant is established beforehand. // The planning factor was ' ' confusing ' ' for Clare and ' ' restricting ' ' in the eyes of Gilchrist . When things went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , ' ' Clare said . The Chinese , on the other hand , saw US economic troubles as the American ' ' excuse for everything , ' ' he added. // There were many pleasant surprises for the Americans , too . Clare says the Chinese are up to date in machine tools - a must for any manufacturing operation . He also says their economy is growing faster than planners thought it would . And the Chinese have ' ' a marvelous sense of humor and are very open people , ' ' Clare recalls . ' ' When you get a bit testy , you don ' t feel you ' ve lost ground with them . It ' s an open and free thing. ' ' // The two executives still think that , all things considered , this joint venture is not much different from others they have done . They really see themselves as bringing management and production systems to China - rather than products . And they also believe that they ' ve charted unknown waters for other US companies. // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the Chinese , ' ' says Gilchrist . ' ' The Chinese system is now much more prepared . . . . Our contract will serve as a prototype for joint ventures in the future. ' ' // //
