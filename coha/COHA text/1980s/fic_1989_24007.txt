BACKDAIRE By Fae Myenne Ng Mah left early to get her hair electrified at Duckie 's mom 's . On her way out she tapped on my door . " Get up Leila ! " she said . " Leon 's coming home today . Clear a space in the bathroom . And vacuum ! Do n't forget under the couch . " The door clicked shut . Like the journeys of the eight holy immortals , Leon Leong 's comings and goings ordered Mah 's life . Leon 's work as a merchant seaman was a good thing because it kept him away for months at a time . She learned from experience ; my father was a wolf . He married her quickly and just as quickly he left her . Now she thought it was better to let a man into her life slowly . Leon Leong was her second husband , the one she married for the green card . It was no secret ; even Leon knew that was why she said yes . He did n't care ; he knew his card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.S. Independent docked two days in Melbourne and Leon had planned to look up the father I 'd never seen : Lyman Poo . This time I was as nervous as Mah was about Leon 's return . My boyfriend and I were still in bed . I listened to Mah 's footsteps going down the rickety steps below our apartment window , then rolled over and hugged Mason ; there was a faint metal smell in his hair . Mason is a mechanic  --  a really good one  --  foreign cars only . " Huh ? " Mason stirred . " What ? " Mason does n't speak Chinese , so 1 translated . Fae Myenne Ng is at work on a novel . This is her first short story to appear in a national magazine . She lives in San Francisco . " She just gave me a list of things to do , gettingready-for-Leon stuff . " Then I whispered , " And she said riot to sleep the morning away with you . " " Nab . " He gave a laugh . " She likes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mah did n't like Mason staying over , so I made him leave in the middle of the night . He was working on the Karmann Ghia then , and it made such a racket starting up that Mah finally gave in . She said , " Better for the neighbors to see the car in the morning and wonder , than for them to look out the window in the middle of the night and know . " The first time Mason came over , I waited for him downstairs . It was night and the street lamp on Pacific poured a sliver of light into Salmon Alley . His white car glistened , clean as the inside of a cut turnip . There 's an old , blue sign at the bottom of our steps : #2-4-6 UPDARE . You ca n't miss it , and it was the first thing Mason saw . He pointed at the sign with his chin . Then he threw his head back and laughed . " D-A-1-R-E ? " He looked at me and laughed again . I shrugged . So ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , where I lived . Mason is my first horn-here boyfriend . The others were all born-theres , like me . They did n't feel comfortable outside of Chinatown ; they did n't even much like doing things outside the family . Mason works in the Mission , and he takes me out to eat there sometimes . He knows what to order ; his last girlfriend was Mexican . Mason likes to ski and we go to Tahoe as much as we can . He does n't care if he 's the only Chinese guy on the expert runs ; he knows he 's good enough . What surprises me is that he never gambles . " It 's too Chinesey , " he says . There 's that about him though ; he says stuff in that half-embarrassed tone . When we were getting to know each other , I liked that we did things on our own , so I did n't ask about his family . But then I started to wonder , did n't they care about him ? Did n't he like me enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she told me what she heard : " Real messed-up family , one sister married a white guy and another overdosed on Q 's . " " Hey , " Mason said now , nudging me . " Looks like she 's in a good mood today , maybe you could tell her , huh ? " Mason was moving into his own place in the Mission , and he wanted me to move in with him . I wanted to , but 1 did n't know how Mah would take it . " Maybe , " I said . I did n't know how to tell her . One thing I liked about Mason : he said things . 1 mean , I thought about a lot of things , but I never actually said them . Out loud . I turned away from him , gave a kick under the covers to show my irritation . " Just do n't take too long , that 's all , " he said . I knew why I was putting it off ; I was waiting for Leon too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with my father  --  a word , a picture , an expression  --  something that would unlock me from Mah , this alley , Chinatown . " I ca n't help it , I just feel like I owe her . It 's always been just me and her . " Mason 's voice was soft . " Lei , she 's got Leon now . " Nhen I was seven , Mah took me out for said , but so is a pretty mouth and a heady compliment . " Why him ? " I said . " He asked me . " Mah cut a piece of fuun with her chopsticks . " What do you think ? " I poured soy over my fuun , swirled it around on my plate , then put the whole sloppy piece in my mouth . I 'd seen him only a few times , so I did n't know what to say . I chewed . " Well , " I said , " he 's kinda bald up there . " Mah laughed . " You know the saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mah and Leon were married in Rena . I was their witness . Leon 's cousin Alvin was service manager at Harrah 's and hooked the Pink Room at a discount . Mah finished our dresses the night before . Pink lace over pink satin , a princess neckline , cap sleeves , an Empire waist , and a big satin bow in the back . I coached Mah about the ceremony . " The man 'll look up at you after saying a lot of stuff . Just say , ' I do . ' And nod . " But when she said it in the justice 's office , her accent made it sound like a question . " I do ? " Afterwards we gambled . Mah and I played the slot machines in between watching Leon play poker . A bus from Chinatown arrived bringing some of Mah 's friends from the sewing factory . They had coupons for free coffee and they invited Mah , so 1 walked around looking into shops . 1 was fingering a suede shoulder bag when Leon came up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . This is what I 'd worried about all through the bus ride up here : what to call him after they married . I expected Mah to give me directions , but she did n't , and now Leon and I were alone , and I just stared at the bag . " Let me buy it , " he said . I shrugged . I drew my finger back and forth on the suede , making lines . He handed me two twenties and nodded toward the register . " Go on . " He smiled . " Pay the lady . It 's a souvenir . " When we stepped out of the store , I turned and said thanks , but avoided looking at him . " No need . " He tapped my shoulder lightly , almost like he was saying thanks . The leather smell was strong . I looked at the hag and wondered if the braided straps and long suede fringe were me , Would 1 ever use this ? Was it too American ? I worried that I was wasting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do 1 call you now ? " He shrugged . " Call me Leon ... That 's what they call ships . " Lyman Foo , my real father , was called many stamps ; Australia was the biggest part of my collection . I held the miniature pictures in my palm : the big rock , the koalas , Queen Elizabeth . The scalloped edges pieced together the faint world he lived in , and the more I had , the more of him I felt I owned . His money orders shrunk first in figures and then in frequency , until Mah said they were only eggs , rotten ones . In his last letter , his message fit into one square corner . Each stroke was bold , magnified : Leila , Do n't blame me . Mah 's eyes dimmed first from crying and then from the sweat jobs : hemming skirts , sewing collar buttons , bead-embroidering dragons and phoenixes onto wedding cheongsams . She was inconsolable . She went to bed with questions : Tell me how to live ? How to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curses : Turtle ! Salted Egg ! Drunk-head ! Mah called long-distance to her brother in San Francisco . She held the black mouthpiece with two hands and shouted , " Ai ! Ai ! Aiyah ! " Her cries told the whole story : the runaway husband , the child in school , the red in her face . Her heavy , heavy face . Her child 's matted hair . She did n't hint , she threatened . " Death . I will jump into the harbor . Take this child , this no-good child . " Her brother sent money , and in three months , we were in San Francisco . When we arrived , the factory was sewing woolen coats . " Flipped , " her brother explained . " We work the summer fabrics in the winter andknow , Mason lessons . " " Oh yeah ? " she said . " It 's always good to have a skill . " " Yesterday I parked on Broadway , you know , on the steep side near Taylor , " I said . She frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned sideways , sucked in , one hand pushed down on her belly . I went over and tugged at the seams . " Maybe just a little , " I said . " You should n't sleep with him so much , " she said . I looked at her but did n't say anything . She scrunched up her nose and scowled into the mirror . " My stomach sticks out too much . I 'm going to try on the dress . " She climbed off the bed . " It 's not that bad . " I smoothed the footprints out of the bedspread . " You never know . Mason 's good now , but he could change , " she said . " He 's not like that . " My voice sounded harsh . " Oh . " Her mouth made that round 0 shape that meant she was embarrassed . " Tomorrow , I 'm going to start exercising , " she said . She peeled the waistband over her belly . I stared at the top of her head . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Her legs stopped moving from side to side and 1 saw the pink of her kneecaps . She looked up at me . " What do you think of him , my father , now ? " " Waste of time , " she muttered . " Well , " I said , looking away , " do n't you ever think about him ? " " Why should I ? That was so long ago . " She took the dress off the hanger , bunched it up in her fists , and slipped it over her head . I folded her pants . " Mah , " I said , looking up , " I 'm going to move to the Mission with Mason . " Her head slowly emerged from the folds of pink wool . She looked at me in the mirror . It was quiet for a long time . I thought , I look like her . The shape of the face , the single fold above the eye , the smallish round mouth . I wondered : Will I be like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , away from me . The unzippered dress showed her back , still straight ; her skin was still smooth . I went over to zip her up , and when she turned around , I said , " Wear this , you look great . " " No Chinese there , you know , " she said . " There are some , " I said . " Why not get married ? " she asked . She still would n't look at me . " I 'll see how it goes , " I said . For a minute I expected the worst , that she 'd slap me , hit me with a hanger , call me names . " Give it a test . " She nodded and then muttered , almost to herself , " Remember Ato have a way out . " " A man inside , behind a desk , you know ? " Mah muttered something as she cracked open a clamshell . " That 's people talking , " Leon said . I thought about it . " So , what 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned the situation here . " " Well ? " I waited . " What exactly did you say ? " " I told him about your mah and me . " Leon looked over at Mah , who was busy with a crab claw . " Well ! What did he say ? " I could n't stand it ; Leon was so slow sometimes , it killed me . I wanted more . I gave my chopsticks three hard taps on the tabletop . Mah looked up , scowling . " Easy . " Mason put his hand on my leg . I sat back . He peeled a prawn and put it on my plate and I popped the whole thing into my mouth . " What about me ? Did he ask about me ? " " Sure , " Leon said . " I told him that you 'd finished school , stuff like that . " He looked at Mah . She gave him some fish . " Good piece , " she said . I was n't satisfied . " How 'd it end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mouth . " What else ? Shook hands , said goodbye , long life and good luck . " Ilistened to us eating  --  Mah and Leon , Macousin 's Volvo . The last thing I saw as Mason backed out of the alley was the old , blue sign , #2-4-6 UPDAIRE . No one 's ever corrected it ; somebody repaints it every year because , like the photos at Tao-Tao 's , the ghosts of the old-timers hang over us , wanting us to look back , to remember . I was reassured ; I knew what i kept in my heart would last . So I was n't worried when I turned that corner , leaving the blue sign , Salmon Alley , Mah and Leon  --  everythingbackdaire. ? 68 HARPERS MAGAZINE/ APRIL 1989
