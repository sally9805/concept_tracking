The 11-story Delta rocket , built and launched by the McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company of Huntington Beach , Calif. , roared off a launching pad at Cape Canaveral , Fla. , at 6 : 59 P.M. , carrying a television broadcasting satellite for a British company into space. // Although private companies have previously sent small rockets on suborbital flights , the launching was the first in which a privately owned rocket was big enough to boost a payload into an earth orbit . <> <> Government Agencies Involved // In contrast to this commercial advance , the thousands of other satellites put into orbit since the Soviet Union ushered in the space age with its launching of Sputnik in 1957 have all been launched by government agencies or government-owned companies in the United States , Europe , India , Japan , China and the Soviet Union. // " This is the beginning of a whole new era in space for America , " said Stephanie Lee-Miller , director of the Transportation Department ' s commercial space office in Washington . " We ' re now aggressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , which regulates the new fleet of commercial rockets , expects six more private launchings to take place this year . It says 27 additional launchings are now scheduled through 1993 . The space office weighs mission safety , sets insurance standards and issues licenses to companies for private launchings . <> <> Rival Efforts in Europe // The new fleet will compete against Arianespace , a consortium based in France that now dominates the launching of commercial sattelites . It is owned by the 11 Western European governments that make up the European Space Agency. // " This is a proud milestone for McDonnell Douglas and yet another positive step in the nation ' s return to space pre-eminence , " Carl J. Dorrenbacher , president of McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company , a subsidiary of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation , said in a statement. // The building of private rockets , a goal long pursued by many small American companies , picked up speed when President Ronald Reagan ordered most commercial payloads off the nation ' s fleet of space shuttles after the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan ' s action instantly created a large market for satellite launchings . Major American rocket companies , including the General Dynamics Corporation , McDonnell Douglas and the Martin Marietta Corporation , were quick to respond. // They founded groups to market their rockets , which until then had been sold exclusively to the Government . But their production lines had been virtually closed down after the space shuttle was designated the national launcher for all payloads , and it took them some time to gear up for heightened production. // The push for commercial rocket production was accelerated in early 1988 , when Mr. Reagan unveiled a plan to spur private space ventures . The plan included limits on the liability of private space ventures and provided for greater private use of Federal installations like launching pads . <> <> A Successful Suborbital Flight // In March the nation ' s first private rocket big enough to require a Federal license roared into space from the Defense Department ' s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico on a successful suborbital flight that lasted about 15 minutes. // The satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles , a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation , for British Satellite Broadcasting of London , which plans to beam television programs from space to homes in Britain whose receivers are equipped with 12-inch dish antennas. // The television satellite , which will be 24 feet long when deployed , will take several days to reach a point about 22 , 300 miles above the Equator , where its orbit will keep the craft stationary in relation to the rotating earth . Hughes was hired by British Satellite Broadcasting to build two such satellites and have them launched into space under a $300 million contract. // The Delta rocket that launched the satellite was a standard one that McDonnell Douglas has sold many times to the Government . What was new was that the company owned it and controlled its launching . <> <> Air Force to Get $1 Million // The rocket was fired from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida . The launching team was made up of a mixture of McDonnell Douglas employees and Air Force personnel and contractors. // Sheila M. Carter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be paid more than $1 million for the use of its launching pad and tracking stations. // Of the private rockets scheduled for launching , McDonnell Douglas is to loft eight , on Delta rockets ; General Dynamics eight , on Atlas rockets , and Martin Marietta five , on Titan rockets . All the payloads for these rockets will be satellites that go into orbit . Several smaller companies are also scheduled to launch suborbital payloads , mainly to study the short-term effects of weightlessness on industrial manufacturing processes. // Ms. Lee-Miller , head of the Transportation Department ' s space office , said she expected the number of flights to grow , " reflecting an increasing interest in access to space . " One problem , she said , was that companies wanting to launch rockets could overwhelm spare launching capacity at the Government ' s spaceports . One possible solution would be state initiatives , like those under consideration in Hawaii and Florida , to build private launching pads and spaceports , she said . <> <> Program at Turning Point // Dr. Chris Shove , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based in Titusville , Fla. , that promotes space development in Florida , said in an interview that the commercial program in America was at a turning point. // " It ' s critical right now that the United States demonstrate it can provide reliable commercial access to space , " Dr. Shove said . " Otherwise , we ' ll be closed out of the international market. " // The majority of the world ' s commercial satellites are now launched by Arianespace . Since 1979 , 29 Ariane rockets have been successfully launched from its spaceport at Kourou in French Guiana . Arianespace now has orders to loft 33 satellites . While the consortium says it is a private , profit-making venture , American officials contend that it is subsidized by European governments. // Dr. Shove said that so far the United States had made a poor showing against Arianespace because the launching of the nation ' s new family of private rockets has been repeatedly delayed . Originally , the first orbital launching had been set for May , and some satellites have been waiting since the Challenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several companies " have written off America as a place to launch from , and have been going with Ariane , " Dr. Shove said , adding , " This Delta launch will help change that perception , but the message so far has been that the United States isn ' t the right place to launch. " // Ms. Lee-Miller of the Transportation Department ' s space office said the launching schedule was going as smoothly as could be expected for a new program. // " There ' s been lots of weather and technical reasons for delay , " she added . " Even the smallest issue can cause a delay , because the companies want to guarantee accuracy for each mission . They want to err on the side of safety. " // But she said that the nation ' s overall move toward launching private rockets was " going very well " and that this first orbital launching " shows the U.S. has strong commitment to competing in the global commercial launch market.
