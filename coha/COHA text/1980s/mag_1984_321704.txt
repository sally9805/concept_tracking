The trial of Automaker John Z. De Lorean on cocaine-trafficking charges was nearly short-circuited last week by eight white envelopes . Six jurors and two alternates in the ten-week-old trial acknowledged that they had received unsolicited copies of a House report that was highly critical of the kind of FBI " sting " operation that snared De Lorean . The material came from the office of California Congressman Don Edwards , chairman of the subcommittee that prepared the study . Edwards said the copies were posted in response to what seemed a routine request from a San Francisco letter writer to forward the report to 13 people in the Los Angeles area . Said Edwards : " I think somebody is tampering with the De Lorean criminal case . I do n't like the idea , and I sure do n't like them involving me . " FBI agents said that the name signed to the request letter seemed to be fictitious . Although at least one juror admitted having scanned the report , no mistrial was declared . <P> In an ironic echo of the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , was arrested last week by narcotics agents in Clinton , N.J. She was charged with conspiring to distribute 14 grams of cocaine .
