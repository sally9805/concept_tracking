I was twice fired . Will I be tagged a troublemaker ? Why does my secretary resent picking up my laundry and balancing my checkbook ? My boss throws temper tantrums . What do I do ? Well , you could ask Andy . In a column published each Wednesday in the San Jose Mercury News , Andrew Grove , president of Intel , a semiconductor manufacturer , answers questions about the woes of the workplace . Since last October , Grove has been dealing with two letters a week in the column " High Output Management , " which has been modeled after " Dear Abby . " <P> Grove , 48 , the son of a Hungarian dairyman , came to the U.S. in 1957 . After working in research and development at Fairchild Camera &; Instrument , he joined Intel ( 1984 sales : $1.6 billion ) in 1968 shortly after it had been founded by two Fairchild alumni . He was named president in 1979 . Despite his business success , Grove was always attracted to publishing . He has written a book on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also appeared in FORTUNE , the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times . Last summer at a party during the Democratic Convention , Grove revealed to Mercury News editors his yen to write a regular column . He reports that the editors picked up the offer before they could down another drink . Perhaps price was a reason for the haste . Grove is paid $50 a week . <P> While his readers are likely to include company presidents and venture capitalists , many of Grove 's correspondents are young women in low-level management positions . " These are people who put paper in typewriter because they have a problem . You can almost hear their plaintiveness , " he says . The most common gripe , not surprisingly , concerns bosses : " The supervisor is too dictatorial . He hassles you too much . He does n't give enough credit . He does n't know how to motivate . " Some letters involve problems that women face in handling new executive jobs . Others ask how to deal with a subordinate who wants your job . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Grove of a recent invitation to a party at the home of one of the firm 's managers . " While I was there , I noticed a group gathered outside on the patio . I guess I 'm naive , but I decided to join the crowd . Well , they were smoking grass , and they had other drugs available . " The reader declined to participate , but feared that " I may be too conservative . " Grove firmly approved of his correspondent 's actions . <P> Grove acknowledges his own limitations , as any credible advice columnist must do from time to time . A recent exchange went this way : " I am young , female and blond . Almost every time I deal with a male client , I 'm ' hit on . ' I want to be nice , but I 'm finding it harder and harder to be nice to someone who talks to my breasts instead of my face . " Grove 's response : " Not being young , female or blond , I find myself unqualified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me how you have been coping with this problem . " " Dear Abby " could not have put it better .
