Two years ago , research librarian Edwina Barron , 46 , rented a condo in Euclid , a mostly white Cleveland suburb . Just a month later , she fled to a bungalow in a quiet , racially mixed neighborhood in Cleveland . Here she describes an encounter with a white neighbor who had been drinking that occurred just one night after she moved into the Euclid condo . The incident persuaded her to get out . <P> " At about 10 p.m. , just as I was pulling into the parking lot , I heard a car alarm go off , in another lot off to the side . I pulled into my designated spot , and the gentleman whose home faced the spot where I parked came to the door and very abruptly made the statement ' Do we have to put up with this kind of racket every night ? ' The only thing I could say was ' That was n't my car . I do n't have an auto alarm . ' <P> " Less than half an hour later , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at that point he was opening the screen door and coming in and saying ' I have to talk to you . ' It was the same man . His attitude was ' We do n't want you here . ' He commented that he had been shot by a black once . Then he started going into ' black trash ' and so on and so forth . He let me know that if I decided to stay there , I would have to look forward to whatever happened and he would not be responsible . He said some of the neighbors had had a discussion about it , and in essence , if I stayed there , I would be taking my chances . <P> " I had mixed emotions : hostility , hatred , anger . At that point , it was just welling up in me . I felt like I was in a pressure cooker . To be truthful , if I had had a gun  --  and I 'm scared to death of them  --  I would probably have blown his brains out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me like this . I 've done nothing to anyone . ' If the people around me had ignored me , acted like I did n't exist , that would not have disturbed me one bit because I 've been black all my life and run into situations like this . But I resented someone coming at me like that . "
