DIED . Italo Calvino , 61 , Italian author of fanciful imagination and technical virtuosity who used surreal fables and phantasmagorical science fiction to express thoroughly modern , realistic observations on human absurdity ; of complications following a stroke ; in Siena , Italy . A Resistance fighter during World War II , he drew on his partisan experiences in early , realistic works like The Path to the Nest of Spiders ( 1947 ) , but turned more and more to fantasy in such books as The Baron in the Trees ( 1957 ) , Invisible Cities ( 1973 ) , The Castle of Crossed Destinies ( 1974 ) and If on a Winter Night a Traveler ( 1979 ) . One of his best-known works is a rich collection , Italian Folktales ( 1956 ) , which reflected his belief that " fables are true " and , conversely , that reality is fabulous .
