It is with a sense of utter outrage that I read about the recommendations of some ecologists that the hunting of leopards and an international trade in leopard skins be resumed ( ( ENVIRONMENT , July 20 ) ) . The only large animal that is not on an endangered list , to judge by its numbers , is the human being . However , I would not on that account recommend that it be hunted . <P> George S.
