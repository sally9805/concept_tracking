The accused : 19 former government and army officials of Grenada . The charge : murder . Chief among their alleged victims was Maurice Bishop , the leftist Prime Minister who died , along with ten of his followers , on Oct. 19 , 1983 , precipitating the U.S. invasion of Grenada six days later . Prominent among the defendants are Bernard Coard , 40 , and his wife Phyllis , 39 . They led an extreme leftist faction within Bishop 's government that allegedly sought to wrest control from the popular Marxist leader , presumably with the intention of pursuing even more radical policies after they had gained power . <P> When the trial opened last week in St. George 's , the island 's capital , the proceedings were livery indeed .

" Observed the trial judge dryly : " I must say , her voice does n't sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to enter their pleas , loudly challenged the tribunal 's legitimacy , and several said they refused to be tried while Grenada was under foreign occupation . After 90 tumultuous minutes , the trial was adjourned until next week .
