All kinds of people are being talked about for Mayor in 1983 , even though Election Day 1982 is months away and Mr. Koch could lose his race for Governor . A dozen or so possible candidates - an unusually large number - have emerged in the meandering conversations that politicians like to have , and that does not include any who may have made up their minds after sundown last night. // There are people who say they are running for sure , the most obvious example being Carol Bellamy , the City Council President , who will automatically become Mayor if Mr. Koch goes to Albany and will then seek election in her own right . There are people who say they are seriously thinking about running , such as Donald R. Manes , the Borough President of Queens , and others who say there is a " potential " that they will think about running , like Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin. // // Caution Prevails at City Hall // A few people may not even be thinking , yet their names surface as long shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. // What makes this more than idle talk , many city officials agree , is that the normal ebb and flow of government has already been altered in New York City. // A discernible note of caution has settled upon municipal affairs since Mayor Koch first hinted last Jan. 25 that he was interested in the Governor ' s office. // Many of those considering a mayoral contest hold high public office , including five of the eight members of the Board of Estimate . None seem willing to rock any boats or to take on someone who could make life uncomfortable for any Mayor if he is elected Governor. // Miss Bellamy , whose relations to Mr. Koch get ever closer , has even agreed to stand in for him tomorrow night before Democratic political clubs that have scheduled appearances by the Mayor and his gubernatorial opponent , Lieut . Gov . Mario M. Cuomo. // It has been a long time since Mr. Goldin held the sort of news conference that he called last December to outline his differences with Mr. Koch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks anyone else these days . " Everyone ' s first order of business is to just make sure that Ed Koch won ' t be around , " said one official who exchanged bluntness for anonymity. // " It ' s like watching a quadrille , " said Steven Matthews , an assistant to the Comptroller who has been involved in a few political campaigns . " Only in this quadrille , everyone watches where everyone else is , with one hand extended and one hand behind the back with a knife in it and everyone afraid to take their eye off each other. " // In private conversations , many officials express concern that , should Mr. Koch take over the Statehouse , the entente in New York City will be replaced by wild and woolly governance. // There Miss Bellamy will be , these officials say , trying to put a mayoralty together while having to campaign in a Democratic primary that would come within months . " Everyone will be looking to do her in , " said one member of the Koch administration . <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is preparing for a barrage from what she calls " all the names that have been mentioned - plus about 50 others. " // Besides Mr. Goldin and Mr. Manes , the list of elected officials who have figured in early discussions include Representative Mario Biaggi , Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink ; Howard Golden , the Borough President of Brooklyn ; Andrew J. Stein , the Borough President of Manhattan ; Edward L. Sadowsky , the chairman of the City Council ' s Finance Committee , and Mr. Cuomo - who , of course , would have to lose to Mr. Koch this year for all the speculation to have any meaning. // Other names arise as well , although usually less often and some amid considerable conjecture . They include Mr. Ravitch , Secretary of State Basil A. Paterson , Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire , former Representative Herman Badillo , the financier Felix G. Rohatyn , the labor leader Victor Gotbaum and John E. Zuccotti , the former First Deputy Mayor . <> <> Potential for Elbowing Noted // One reason so many names have arisen , several officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probable front-runner , especially if she is the only woman in the race - will take office without the aura of invincibility that Mr. Koch has fashioned for himself . Assaults are likely from the City Council and the Board of Estimate , both bodies with possible rivals in key positions who could make life hard for her. // The potential for elbowing has become apparent in little ways . Yesterday , for example , Mr. Goldin ' s office issued an advisory about a news conference to be held today on a financial settlement reached with 10 former City University teachers who the courts had found were unlawfully dismissed during the McCarthy era of the 1950 ' s. // The session came as a surprise to Miss Bellamy ' s staff , which had worked hard for several years on the settlement . After a few questions were raised , Mr. Goldin called Miss Bellamy and other officials to invite them to the news conference. // To help get ready , Miss Bellamy has let a few important members of the Koch administration know - chief among them Deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay . There have been a lot of meetings with business and labor leaders - described by some people familiar with the gatherings as attempts to elicit Wall Street ' s confidence even as she tries to maintain an air of liberal zeal befitting the Peace Corps volunteer she once was. // Mostly , however , in the quietude that has characterized government this year , Miss Bellamy waits . So , apparently , do the others . " It ' s much too early to sort out the variables , " said Mr. Goldin , who paused and added : " There just might not be an election next year . We ' ll see.
