The night it snowed in the Green Mountains , coming down so densely in places that vision ceased just in front of the head lamps on the car , an engineer with General Motors , a troubleshooter in the Chevrolet division , stopped off for the evening in one of those wonderful old Victorian inns in Vermont . The innkeeper was bearded , avuncular , inquisitive , fleshy , and given now and again to alcohol and nicotine . His wife sometimes fretted that he might be a heart in search of an attack . There was a cheery blaze in the fireplace . <P> The engineer , a soft-looking fellow named Jim , came from New Jersey , one of an elite 25 in the " field force . " He had charge of all New England-Willy Loman with a wrench . He was here , in Bethel , to see about a problem at the Chevy dealership . He accepted a white wine . <P> The innkeeper , whose name was Lyle Wolf , was from Los Angeles . One of a growing number of novices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a couple of years ago , chased the ghost of Thornton Wilder across the continent , and set himself up as a country squire , the possessor of a first-edition mortgage-Bob Newhart with a plumber 's helper . His wife 's name was Barbara , and Barbara was saying , over wine , that she had a relative hurt in a Corvair . <P> Jim said that the Corvair was a little before his time , then sidestepped his interlocutors ' curiosity about the trouble down at the local dealership . And what was it like to run an inn ? Does it strain a marriage ? <P> " Only when we 're alone , " said Lyle , " or with other people . " <P> One was reminded of S.J. Perelman , who wrote : " Outside of a spring lamb trotting into a slaughterhouse , there is nothing in the animal kingdom as innocent and foredoomed as the new purchaser of a country place . The moment he scratches his signature on the deed , it is open season and no limit to the bag . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just an engineering question , said Jim . And how was the foundation on this old place ? <P> " Not very good , " said Lyle . <P> " Sound , " said Barbara , playing Jim 's game . <P> And what do the Wolfs think of the Bob Newhart show , the television series about a proprietor of a Vermont inn ? <P> " I ca n't stand his stuttering , " said <P> Lyle . " He never greets a guest , " said Barbara . " It 's unrealistic , " said Lyle . <P> " He never has to mow a lawn or unclog a toilet . " <P> Hours passed , dinner passed , Jim went to bed , and Lyle , over brandy , reflected on his lot . He had been a high school teacher in California , a respected one , and he had enjoyed the classroom but abhorred the system , for reasons he did not expand . He quit after 24 years and withdrew $40,000 from his state teachers ' retirement account . He paid $103,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . Barbara , a registered nurse , was 44 . Greenhurst was 90 . Bethel was 203 . <P> The first month they were open , January 1982 , they took in $80.
