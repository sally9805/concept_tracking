Earlier this month , Standard Oil of California offered $80 a share for Gulf stock . At the time of the merger announcement , Gulf ' s stock had been selling at about $71 a share . A month earlier it was selling for around $55 . Savvy investors stand to make millions. // Likewise , investors in Getty . In January , Texaco bought Getty Oil for $10. 1 billion . At the time of the merger announcement , Getty ' s stock had been selling at about $36 a share . By late February , Getty was valued at around $43 a share. // Investors who bought Gulf and Getty stock may have been fortunate - or smart - if they knew how to find potential takeover candidates . Can you , in fact , screen the market for likely target companies ? // Sometimes you can . But whether you ' re a novice investor or a seasoned veteran , an important factor in your success will be the time you spend doing your homework. // Are mergers and acquisitions here to stay ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a surge of activity in this area on Wall Street , prompted by the growing presumption among businesses that it is cheaper and quicker to buy assets than to create them . Essentially , this thought underlies most acquisitions. // Last year the number of mergers and acquisitions completed or pending set a nine-year record of 2 , 533 , according to merger consultants W.T. Grimm &; Co. , while the dollar value paid for completed transactions surged to $73. 1 billion from $53. 8 billion in 1972. // The bad news is that there is no easy path to quick profits in picking stocks of companies likely to be taken over . In situations as complicated and fast moving as mergers , specialists say it ' s difficult at best for an average investor to make the right moves , since most people lack legal and accounting training and research capabilities . Even for professional risk takers , the process is difficult . As a result , they rarely try to speculate on unannounced deals. // Increasingly , takeover attempts are hostile . Sometimes corporate raiders are not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mesa Petroleum ' s T. Boone Pickens Jr. to split up Gulf Oil illustrate such a trend . Corporations are looking at how their targets are structured before making their moves. // According to Douglass M. Barnes , vice-president of D. F. King &; Co. , a New York-based proxy-solicitation firm , a substantial number of contests involve ' ' situations in which the parts ( of the target firm ) are worth more than the whole. ' ' // In shopping for the best investments , Wall Street experts urge that you think like a potential acquirer and use the tools of a security analyst . Read annual reports , proxy materials , outside research data , and the business news in newspapers and magazines . What should you look for ? Some signs deserve attention . None by itself would signal a good stock buy , but together they can point to a company ' s soundness. // // * Good fundamentals . Companies whose fundamental prospects are better than those of competitors are often a lure for acquisitors. // // * The balance sheet . One rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little or no debt and lots of liquid or undervalued assets . ' ' These may be hidden assets that don ' t show up in a report or are grossly undervalued by the marketplace , ' ' says Lawrence Garshofsky , a risk arbitrage specialist at Argus Research Corporation , a financial services firm . An example , he says , might be real estate properties that have been carried on the company ' s books at historical costs for years and have since appreciated in value. // // * Proprietary goods or services . A company that is a leader in its field , marketing goods or services at higher profit margins than competitors , would be attractive to another company . Also , see whether the company has a lot of patents to protect its products. // Consider Maryland Cup Corporation , the largest maker of paper cups and straws . For 10 years , the company had produced impressive earnings growth and developed an excellent distribution system . Last June , before Fort Howard Paper Company announced plans to acquire the company for a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the high 30s . By the end of August , when the merger was completed , investors saw the stock rise to $49. // // * Stock activity . If you notice an unusual amount of trading activity in a company ' s stock , this may mean a predator is seeking a ' ' toehold ' ' in the target company or intends to expand holding when conditions improve. // Investment experts have other signs that they look for in takeover candidates . They counsel people , for instance , to look for companies whose directors have staggered terms , or have adopted other ' ' shark repellent ' ' measures , such as rules requiring mergers to be approved by 80 percent of shareholders . This may indicate that management sees the company as a likely takeover candidate and is adopting a defense posture. // If an outsider has already acquired a chunk of the company , that individual or organization may want to buy more , or may provoke someone else to make a bid . ' ' Generally speaking , when someone acquires 5 percent or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s only a matter of time before a merger or acquisition develops , ' ' says Richard Spring , senior vice-president of David J. Greene &; Co. , a New York-based investment advisory firm. // But not always . ' ' You have to make your own judgment , ' ' says Leonard Chazen , a partner of Fried , Frank , Harris , Shriver &; Jacobson , a New York law firm that has been in many takeover battles . ' ' Frequently , the ( outsider ) will change his mind . ' ' Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch says he is after up to 49. 9 percent of Warner Communications . Whether or not he really is , Murdoch had to tip his hand about his initial stock buy . Securities and Exchange Commission rules require reporting of an acquisition of 5 percent or more of a company ' s shares. // One hot area is the leveraged buy-out , in which management and private investors , financed largely with money borrowed against the assets acquired , purchase the publicly held shares of the company and take it private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - have involved Royal Crown and Dr Pepper , two soft-drink firms . But compared with most standard hostile takeovers , premiums yielded by leveraged buy-outs are modest , experts say. // In the future , the juiciest targets of takeover attempts are apt to be banks , savings institutions , and other financial service concerns , investment experts predict . Natural resource and metals companies will also be attractive targets . And don ' t rule out electronics , computer , and telecommunication concerns , partly because of the breakup of AT &; T and the settlement of a federal antitrust suit against IBM. // So the best places to scout will be in these areas , particularly banks . Predicts D.F. King ' s Mr. Barnes : ' ' The banking arena is going to be explosive in terms of mergers and acquisitions over the next five to 10 years. ' ' // Anyone so inclined can expect to do reasonably well in anticipating reorganization plays - at least some of the time . But choosing a stock , you should develop a good understanding of the company ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That will limit your risk and enable you to judge how much to invest. // //
