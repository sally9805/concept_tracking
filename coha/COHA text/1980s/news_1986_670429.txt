" All they wanted was a space in the woods and an outhouse , " said Barry Brown , a part owner of the campground . " But nowadays people aren ' t exactly roughing it. " // Some campers still toast marshmallows at Lone Oak , but hardly anyone sleeps in a tent anymore . Instead they retreat to expensive trailers or motor homes , where the camping gear now includes television and stereo sets , microwave ovens and sometimes even artificial lawn turf. // The campground offers large-screen movies , two heated swimming pools and tours to local shops , museums and wineries . Weekend entertainment recently featured a hypnotist , and country and western bands have played here . Soon Lone Oak will open a nightclub for drinking and dancing. // While those in search of a more rustic vacation still camp in tents at state and national forests and parks , private campgrounds have increasingly taken on the conveniences of home . The sophisticated camping gear started to become popular more than a decade ago , but only in the last few years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents and more modest trailers . <> <> Gasoline Prices Help // And this year , with relatively lower gasoline prices , even more vacationers have invested in the expensive camping equipment. // Joseph McNamara relaxed in the air-conditioning of his 32-foot camping trailer and gave little thought to the menacing storm clouds moving over the area . " We ' ve got everything right here , " said Mr. McNamara , who owns a home in Canton , Conn . " It doesn ' t matter how hard it rains or how the wind blows. " // When Lone Oak was founded in 1964 by Abraham Brown , a dairy farmer , it was only the third private campground in Connecticut . Today there are more than 50 such campgrounds in the state . And campgrounds here and throughout the Northeast report thriving business in recent years. // Campground proprieters say the nature of the camper , as well as camping , has changed markedly in recent years , with more upper-income professionals taking up what had once been regarded as an activity mostly for lower-income families. // Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start a campground here , said Barry Brown , the son of the founder and a part owner , because they feared it would attract " the lower-class element. " // But as the camping clientele has become increasingly upper middle class here , he said , expensive shops and restaurants in the area have become grateful for the campgrounds . <> <> A New Image for Camping // " These are people who could afford to do anything - and they ' re going camping , " Mr. Brown said . " The image of camping has really changed. " // At the KOA campground in Watkins Glen , N.Y. , the management has recently erected cabins , because fewer campers are willing to weather storms in a tent . The campground offers movies , a miniature golf course and kayaking activities . It also serves breakfast in its dining room. // " We ' re getting people who expect nicer accommodations , " said Marion Scata , the campground manager . " These people want to be entertained. " // At a picnic table shaded by poplars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner of chicken marinated with red wine . Their 8-year-old son , Adam , was at the movies in the campground clubhouse. // Neither Mr. Hutchinson , a 41-year-old sales executive , nor his wife , a professor of English literature at Utica College of Syracuse University , had gone camping as youths . They prefer the peace of their camper , they said , to the comforts of a motel , which gives little flavor of a region. // " Maybe it ' s the whole ecology thing , " said Mrs. Hutchinson , noting that the many of today ' s campers were young adults in the 1960 ' s and 70 ' s , influenced by the nascent environmental movement . Now , with their own children , these vacationers often turn to camping because of their appreciation of nature. // " We brought a television , which we said we ' d never do , " Mr. Hutchinson conceded . " But we try to limit it to newscasts and cartoons on rainy days. " // Across the way Paul Fidishun stepped from his $50 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive from Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , was planning where he , his wife , Jane , and their poodle would go next - " according to whichever way the sun shines. " // Mr. Fidishun , whose vehicle gets eight miles to the gallon , said he could not relax easily in a hotel or motel room . On a campground , he can open the door of his home and step into the woods rather than into a parking lot. // " And I don ' t have to get dressed up to go eat in a restaurant , " he said . " I can sit outside in my jeans and sip a can of beer. " // Winnebago Industries in Forest City , Iowa , the company that began manufacturing motorized homes in the mid-1960 ' s , plans an even more luxurious vehicle for 1987 , said Robert Cooley , the marketing director . The new model , selling for $65 , 000 to $70 , 000 , will have - besides all the standard features , like a microwave oven - a dashboard television screen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , there is no need for a rear-view mirror. // " Some people like to yacht on the water , " said Robert Cooley , director of marketing for Winnebago , " and some people like to yacht on land. " // The increased popularity of camping among the affluent , campground operators said , might stem from heightened pressures in the professional and corporate world . Peter Reed , a spokesman for Kampground of America , said camping was attracting " an increasing number of professionals who say , ' Hey , I don ' t want to be a professional today : I want to relax. ' " // But not all the professionals , he noted , are staying in the fanciest trailers or motor homes . A club of physicians , he said , ride together to campsites on motorcycles and camp in tents. // Many vacationers are also attracted to the social interaction of a campground , camping operators said , In a motel , they noted , families in separate rooms rarely sit and visit . But in campgrounds the relaxed setting encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some vacations , children can get very bored , " Mr. Brown said . " But when you ' re camping , there are always other children for them to play with. " //
