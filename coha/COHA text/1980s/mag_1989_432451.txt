 | From every zone in the Conde Nast empire they came , editors and art directors , ad people and flaksdrawn by the glossy allure of Vanity Fair . Jostling into a conference room , they took seats , opened box lunches , nibbled grapes , sipped little bottles of Evian water and craned forward to see the hottest editor in America . Up front a photographer 's reflecting umbrella threw immaculate white light on Tina Brown ? a blonde in a scarlet dress , two loops of pearls at her throat , her nails polished toothand-claw red , her ankles sculpted into drop-dead stiletto heels , her silvery voice rippling with London elegance above Manhattan 's barbaric yawp . " We had quite a little blood all over the floor , " she said , describing her early days on the job . " It was rather like Scarface ' . " With uptown elan and Front Page gusto , Brown has taken a heavy little dumpling from Conde Nast and turned it into a real magazine . Her success has made good the company 's 50-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofsavoir-vivre that collapsed in the Depression . She began five years ago as an outsider , an expatriate Brit just turned 30 . Filling her Rolodex with star writers , well-wired editors and superb photographers , she cultivated an affluent audience in New York , Los Angeles and lush urban markets in between . For years the magazine piled up losses ; but it captured attention and picked up steam . Brown tripled her circulation ( from a low of 220,538 to a high of 692,537 ) . She drove her ad pages from an anemic 14 one pallid July in 1984 to a ruddy 146 in this year 's April issue . And she is finally breaking into the black . Up on the 14th floor of the Conde Nast Building , S. I. Newhouse Jr. , the taciturn billionaire who has invested tens of millions of dollars in her experiments , now sits in his sweat shirt , rumpled slacks and scuffed loafers contemplating a winner . " It works , " he says . " As soon as Tina took hold , we were on the right track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the mind of its editor . Brown 's is quick and eclectic ; she may have learned how to read at Oxford , but she learned how to write on Fleet Street : she knows what sells . A hot magazine rides the Zeitgeist , defining the culture and ethos of its time . Brown tapped into the preoccupations of the ' 80s , running with them even as she reported them . The components of this world , exotic and depressing by turns , were greed on Wall Street , a couple in the White House who loved pomp and style , and an economic boom that sharpened the taste of millions for conspicuous consumption . When megabuck swells from the worlds of entertainment , fashion , the arts and investment banking were n't being written up in Vanity Fair , they were reading it or buying ads in it . Where People had first shown the draw of celebrity journalism , Vanity polished the form , then expanded it . " We are dealing with a certain element of gossip raised to a high level , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presenting personalities is the obsession of our time . " Brown arrived from London with a fresh and ironic eye , plenty of energy and fingertips that became highly sensitive to the arrhythmic pulse of American culture in the 1980s . While others bemoaned the vulgarity of nouvelle society and fussed about information overload , she chose to romp in both . " We have Mozart and McDonald 's , " says senior editor Miles Chapman . Her eclectic formula mixes celebrities , movie stars and outlaws of deviant stripes . Filling the house with Jack Nicholson in shades , Claus von Billow in leather and Princess von Thurn and Taxis in diamonds later made it possible to commission more substantial stories on Cory Aquino , Jesse Jackson , General Noriega and Dan Quayle . Columns that she once devoted to fashion epidemics like " Turban Fever " now scan the miseries of crack and AIDS . The new Vanity Fair is a work in progress . With a few exceptions , movie stars still own the cover . The treatment of society , where Brown is a celebrity herself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough as the coverage of domestic politics and international affairs . Easy social targets take knocks , but powerful figures who deserve closer scrutiny ? and brokers of fashion who buy a lot of ads ? are handled more gently . It is one thing to rough up a von Billow , another to reduce a Donald Trump to his elemental particles . " It would be nice to see that magazine take after some people when they are up , rather than when they are down , " says Kurt Andersen , coeditor of Spy , the satirical monthly . Two predecessors , both talented men , failed to restore Vanity Fair to life . Brown succeeded by turning the conventional wisdom of the magazine business upside down . The ' 70s and ' 80s have been The Age of Specialty Magazines , with upscale audiences and ready-made ad constituencies : sporty magazines for runners and muscle builders , fashionable magazines for bright young people with lots of disposable income , salty magazines for millionaires with a yen for boats . This fragmentation of audiences and advertisers has afflicted generalinterest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad pages . Now , against the odds , Brown has put a new one aloft . " She has created a fantastic magazine , " says Leo Scullin , senior vice president at Young &; Rubicam . Two quite contradictory Tinas reside within Brown . The first is assertive , seductive , a fine writer with a good sense of humor and an advanced sense of mischief : the iconoclast who changed the Tatler of London from a limping dowager to a flash-dancing party girl , the beauty who married the rakish Harold Evans , editor first of The Sunday Times and then The Times of London . This Tina is fiery , a gambler . The other Tina is distant , icy in her reckonings : a no-sparks operator who believes " we are here to make friends in our lives , rather than enemies . " The two Tinas operate in tandem , impressing some , terrifying others . Together , they have equipped Brown to be what she really is : a brilliant double agent ? a perfect spy . The original Vanity Fair was a legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crowninshield , a superb editor , filled it with modern art , prose by the finest writers and spectacular photography . Newhouse spent 18 months and $10 million preparing its return . In March 1983 , the new version came back in a pink wash of nostalgia . Medialand hooted . The first editor , Richard Locke , who came from The New York Times Book Review , kept a prototype in his office . " This is @#  | not going to be a coffee-table book , " he told James Wolcott , a Vanity Fair columnist . " This is going to be an ongoing , cultural enterprise . " " Uh , oh , " Wolcott thought . " I almost said , Beam me up , Scotty ' . " Brown did not make the same mistake : she opened a cabaret where high and low culture met and vamped . " Vanity Fair is a coffee-table magazine , part of the glossy breed , " she says . " We do put celebrities on the cover . They are there for one reason only : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows me to do a lot of other things inside . " Magazines that pride themselves on getting more of what 's important on their covers do n't enjoy the same luxury . The approach offended many on her inherited staff . Ambitious young women sat around the office muttering , ' I 'm 30 years old . I went to Vassar . I could do her job , " recalls Sarah Lewis , an old friend and a confidante on the staff . Brown says , " The perceived wisdom was that a great intellectual endeavor had failed and that Conde Nast , in a Philistine spirit , had brought in Little Miss Celebrity , the wonder girl from London , to trash it up . " In building a new team , she kept some of the more talented old hands , added a few partners from London and lured others from top publications as varied as Esquire , The New York Review of Books and Foreign Affairs . Digging into Newhouse 's pockets , she did six-figure deals with top writers . Competitors lacking her assets ? her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for lunch ? began to complain that she was cornering the market in talent . For her first cover , she assigned Helmut Newton to shoot " the ranking bimbos of Hollywood . " Newton lined up Daryl Hannah , blindfolded her and stuck two Oscars in her hands . Daryl scored with " Splash " ; Vanity Fair scored with Daryl . " I hated that story , " says Dominick Dunne , who wrote it . " Incredibly superficial . " All he remembers is the " crunch , crunch , crunch " of a toothy press agent grinding her nachos and guacamole into his tape recorder over lunch . Dunne is a quiet man , a sympathetic listener . Brown credits him with being the first to identify the nouvelle-society woman , to make the point that life was beginning to imitate television . He started with a profile on Candy Spelling , the wife of Aaron Spelling , producer of " Dynasty . " ( Candy wore $4 million worth of jewelry to lunch until the day she got bored and said to her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while and get into art . " ) After that , he pursued Claus von Billow , the society lizard . One Sunday not long before von Billow was acquitted of charges that he had tried twice to kill his wife , he invited Dunne and Newton to the apartment where he lived with his mistress . Later , Dunne placed a call to Brown 's summer place in Quogue : " My God , " he said . " You wo n't believe what happened ! Claus had on his black leather jacket ? and then she had one . " When everyone began to talk , Madison Avenue listened . Vanity Fair 's agile young publisher , G. Douglas Johnston , had something to sell : notoriety , impact . At times the magazine goes overboard in its treatment of decadence and violence . A case in point was its story on John Wideman , the black novelist whose brother and son both went to jail for murder . The Vanity Fair story managed , on flimsy evidence , to suggest that Wideman himself should be held to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story served no purpose but to exploit the misery of a lot of people who were already miserable enough . The day Brown said she wanted the Reagans for a cover on the new American social swim , the staff groaned ? but the idea tickled the First Lady . Harry Benson , the photographer , took a cassette of Frank Sinatra singing " Nancy With the Smiling Face " to the White House . Not only did the Reagans dance ? they kissed . That fall , with Prince Charles andDiana , Princess ofWales , bound for Washington , Brown went to London , scanned the penny press , talked to gossips and reported that Charles was a henpecked wimp . The tabloids buzzed . " Those stories  | put us on the map , " Brown says . " They gave Mr. Newhouse cause to think there was light at the end of the tunnel . " Now for the hard part : how to get serious ? " Paraguay ? Are we big in Paraguay ? " Monday morning . Story-conference time . A dictator has lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like shuttlecocks , the names of writers fly about the office . The first is in Africa , the second chained to his typewriter , the third , a woman who is expert on the Third Reich , seems wrong for " Naziland , " the fourth is not inspiring , the fifth is not macho enough , the sixth is too New York Times-ish . Idea seven scores . " Fabulous , " Brown says . " Totally macho . " One squad of editors totters out , the art people come in . Brown chews her fingertip , sips a Tab through a straw . " Hang on ! Hang on ! " she says . Replacing a leaden idea with a quicker fix , she says , " OK , gang . Where do we stand ? Did we figure it all out ? " When Wolcott comes into the office these days he hardly recognizes the place . " Tina has become an incredible newshound , " he says . " You get the feeling we 've got reporters out all over the world reporting stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss scares a few witless . A free-form meeting convenes regularly in her office , churning up contacts , matching writers to ideas , adjusting the carburetor on a mix that blends movies , fashion , society and the arts with business , politics and foreign affairs . Special-interest magazines tend to be earnest andbland , rigid in format and design . " Here , anything goes , " says managing editor Pamela Maffei McCarthy , who defected from Esquire . Serious profiles with " Tina 's great reads , " long narratives good for a night by the fire or day at the beach ; photo stories pop up next to stories heavy with text . " Vanity Fair is smarter and more sophisticated than People , " McCarthy says . " And I think it is nicer than Spy . " " Whatever you say , do n't call her the Queen of Glitz , " warns T. D. Allman , Vanity Fair 's man in Manila , Panama City , Portau-Prince , Tunis and other Third World depots . T.D . brought Brown an idea for a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " All I want is a story about how the bitch will be out in two months . " Then he did General Noriega . Just about everyone in the press was reporting that Noriega was a goner . T.D . said Pineapple Face would survive . Score : Vanity Fair 2 , The Pack O. Over dinner Henry Kissinger now compliments Tina on her foreign coverage . Everyone knows Henry is an old flatterpuss . But would he say as much if all Brown had in her magazine was Charlotte Rampling or Sylvester Stallone ? In the bad old days , recalls Elise O'Shaughnessy , Vanity Fair 's political editor , " all the good people giggled when I came aboard . " Then Brown started to cover stories like AIDS , the drug scene and the 1988 election . Monthlies are stuck with two- and three-month production lead times . To cut hers , Brown enlisted the help of Newhouse ; he put up money to send Vanity Fair to the printers by satellite . Now she can zip one third of her editorial pages out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high gloss news , which she has put to good use on stories about Dan Quayle , Yasir Arafat , Noriega and Ed Koch , she can even crowd the weeklies . You wo n't find tomorrow 's morning line on the president 's new cabinet , but you might find out how he judges men ? or women . One night O'Shaughnessy flicked on the MacNeil/ Lehrer show to find Gail Sheehy , author of the magazine 's much-talked-about character studies of the 1988 presidential candidates , on the tube . Under the writer 's image one of those little TV ID 's said , " Gail Sheehy , Vanity Fair . " When they register you in the land of the Talking Heads , you have finally arrived . Look across the living room . Is n't that Stephen Sondheim , the composer of musicals , standing by the couch ? And over there . It 's Martin Scorsese , the director . The invitations said cocktails for Melvyn Bragg ? the biographer of Richard Burton . Just beyond him , Joni Evans , that onewoman nuclear reactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Norman Mailer makes a fashionably late entrance , then Bianca Jagger scampers in and upstages him . Poised in the middle of this giddy whirl is Brown ? exerting a force field so strong you can feel it halfway across Sutton Place . She is not a social butterfly or hangeron ; she picks her close friends carefully . Some are British : novelist Sally Emerson and Julie Kavanaugh , literary editor of Harpers &; Queen , who knew her at Oxford , and Tom Stoppard , the playwright . In New York , her inner circle includes Dunne and Marie Brenner , two of her star writers ; Miles Chapman and Sarah Giles , two top editors ; Robert Hughes , the art critic ; James Hoge , publisher of the Daily News ; Swifty Lazar , the superagent , and Mailer . She has turned her magazine and apartment into Manhattan 's liveliest **31;1295;TOOLONG . " I have to walk the line between being involved and also covering things , " she says . " I have to be careful not to betray people , obviously ? while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taught her the rules of a status game that is quite different in the United States and in England . " Americans are much less ironic about their social standing , " she says . " Once people have made $20 million they do n't feel they should be laughed at . You get your kneecaps shot off . Which in England is not the case . I mean , if you make a joke about the Duke of Devonshire , he 's used to being made fun of . It does n't bother him . " In writing about society for Punch , The Sunday Times and Tatler , Brown used an extremely sharp edge . She started honing it at the knee of her father , a spirited man who produced Agatha Christie movies . She became " a keen student of facade . " " As far as I could see , castles were always plaster , money was always funny and the nuns came off the set for a fag . " At Oxford she wangled an interview with Auberon Waugh , that mordant destroyer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brenner knew Brown in those days . " We grew up believing we could do anything a man could , " she recalls . " We did n't even think about it much . " Enter Harry Evans , editor of The Sunday Times . A colleague @# @# @#  | sent him Brown 's clippings from Private Eye and the New Statesman . He liked them and arranged an interview . " My God , I was in love immediately , " Brown remembers . " He was the sexy editor of all time , amazing in action , the Nijinsky of newsprint . Whoosh . Whoosh . Whoosh . Writing headlines , cropping pictures , throwing things out . Kept me waiting half an hour . Said , Do n't bother me now ' . " Evans was very married . She went to America , free-lanced , then brassily intercepted him in Manhattan to show him her work . This time he looked twice : " She wrote me a lot of letters ? a love correspondence , really ? the letters were so marvelous I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprentice story on private detectives . One " ex-Inspector X of Wembley " taught her that to succeed in undercover work , " you have to be a chameleon . You have to merge . " From chameleon she moved into a more subtle role . To be a good spy , says Aline , countess of Romanones , a crack agent ( " The Spy Wore Red " ) in Spain during World War II , you have to look young and innocent , you need tremendous stamina , you must have a good memory and you must be adaptable . Over dinner one night , the countess told Brown and Evans jovially that when she first met them , " I thought both of you were spies . " In the rare ethers of Uptown , the Great Game can get dangerous . There was that time Brown 's old friend Sally Quinn wrote an unbuttoned novel about sex and power in Washington . A Vanity Fair reviewer kissed the book off as " cliterature . " Quinn thought Brown should have warned her , especially since she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Washington Post , had provided the setting for the Evanses ' 1981 wedding in the Hamptons . She disinvited Brown from Bradlee 's birthday party . Brown was shocked . " I do n't recall them sending any postcards saying , Yeah , Georgie , ( or whoever ) , you know you 're about to get the dirt dished on you in The Washington Post . No hard feelings , old sport ' . " Brown sent Bradlee his present anyway . Later the Bradlees helped when George Frederick , the Evanses ' little boy , fell ill with a rare viral disease . The hurricane blew over . The problem of discovering how tough she could be with touchy Americans was n't easy to solve . When she wrote a profile of Gayfryd Steinberg , one of the dynamos of Manhattan 's nouvelle society , she sounded uncharacteristically ambivalent , soft . When David Puttnam , the combative British producer , offered her a scoop on his battles with Hollywood , powerful people in Tinseltown thought she was too tough ? on them . The irony was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very confrontational guy , " she says . " I tend to feel that you ca n't take on the world . It 's much better to try and make alliances with the people who affect your destiny . " The approach sometimes makes her too sensitive to power brokers and advertisers . Once the magazine received an intelligence flash that the doorknobs in Trump Tower were falling off . An editor commissioned a little item . Half an hour later , there was an urgent summons from Brown . She had gotten a call from Newhouse . crisis . The story died . Then there were those worshipful Vanity Fair covers on Ralph and Ricky Lauren and Calvin and Kelly Klein , major advertisers . Resorting to the old powder puff is common enough in magazines that rely upon fashion , cosmetics and department stores for revenue ? but does it become a serious magazine ? Up in Conde Nast 's executive roost , S. I. Newhouse Jr . has decorated his office with elaborate cartoons . The one behind his desk is an assemblage of pained characters swirling around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one youthfully exuberant threat to his women 's magazines ; Rupert Murdoch with his Voguish Mirabella presents another . As his first line of defense he is relying on Brown and Anna Wintour , the new editor of Vogue , who also happens to be very bright , very British and very competitive . At this moment , Dr. Ouch is saying what he thinks about all those rumors of war between Brown and Wintour for the honor of one day replacing Liberman , 76 , the editorial genius who gave the Conde Nast magazines their distinctive look . " In my mind , " the boss says slowly , searching for just the right words , " there is no rivalry between Tina and Anna under any circumstances , let alone to succeed to a job that is n't available , is n't open and is n't even a job that will continue to exist . " But people will talk . " Si has this absolute panic about Elle , " says one knowledgeable source . " He sees Anna , shaking her bangs with that swinging charisma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mascot on the hood of the Rolls-Royce . " What then of Brown , who runs the hotter book ? New York magazine 's gossipy Intelligencer reports mayhem . " It 's a sexy idea , " says Brown . " You know , two hellcats fighting it out at the top of Conde Nast . Never true . I mean who wants to play Peter Martins to Alex 's Balanchine ? " Newhouse pays Brown something more than $200,000 . While she redeemed Vanity Fair , the game would have been over very fast without the owner 's stubbornness and bankroll . A recession could change the picture , turning the Zeitgeist on its fickle heels , altering the way readers feel about the high life of the Reagan years and testing the nerve and budgets of advertisers . But as things stand , having so exuberantly glossed the ' 80s , Brown now has the chance to define fin de siecle America the way Frank Crowninshield 's Vanity Fair captured the ' 20s , to be to the ' 90s what Harold Hayes 's Esquire was to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like watching a brightly polished red Porsche cruising down the highway at 55 miles an hour .
