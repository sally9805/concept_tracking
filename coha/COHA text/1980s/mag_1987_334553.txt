For 77 years , the name Kroh stood for quality and reliability in the real estate industry . Kansas City-based Kroh Brothers Development built homes , shopping centers and office buildings from California to Florida . Along the way , it attracted such blue-chip investors in its projects as Arthur Levitt , the chairman of the American Stock Exchange , and the Hall family of Hallmark greeting-card fame . But in the past few months , Kroh has virtually collapsed . Beset by lawsuits and shunned by wary lenders , the company is now struggling to reorganize under Chapter 11 provisions of the bankruptcy law . The brothers who ran the firm for 18 years  --  John Kroh Jr. , 46 , and George Kroh , 49  --  have resigned , and a battalion of lawyers is trying to sort out the company 's obligations to more than 2,000 creditors . <P> That scene may become painfully familiar in the months ahead as other developers find themselves stretched too thin to adjust to the new tax law . The National Realty Committee , which represents some 300 big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform will cost the real estate industry as much as $50 billion during the next five years . Under the old tax rules , real estate investors could shelter salary and other income with losses generated by limited partnerships . Kroh relied on such partnerships for as much as 20% of its capital , or some $20 million a year . Money was thus readily available for construction of shopping centers and office buildings that might not turn a profit . The funds helped Kroh and other firms maintain a healthy cash flow even when they were not making money . <P> By severely restricting real estate shelters , tax reform has drained that important source of money for the industry . In troubled markets , such as the farm belt and the oil patch , the changes have added to the pressure on shaky developers . Two weeks ago Dallas-based Vantage Companies , the seventh largest U.S. developer , notified its creditors of plans to delay some loan payments and restructure as much as $1 billion in debts . Last week Austin-based Nash Phillips Copus , the seventh largest U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings . <P> The saga of the Kroh brothers shows how fast fortunes can turn in the real estate business . During the past five years , they had nearly tripled their firm 's holdings , from 5.3 million sq . ft. of property to 14.3 million sq . ft . The company was transformed from a family-run Kansas City operation into a national firm with 458 employees , assets of $197.4 million and investments in 13 states . Credit came easily : recognizing the company 's record of success , banks extended Kroh Development $39 million in unsecured loans . <P> In that heady atmosphere , the Krohs became involved in a tangle of overlapping partnerships and took on mortgages and other liabilities that no one fully grasped . Donald Jones , a longtime Kroh senior executive who is now president of the firm , recalls that company officials were often stunned when obligations they had not known about came due . Says a bitter John Kroh Sr. , 82 , who retired as head of the company in 1969 and handed over control to Sons John and George : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
