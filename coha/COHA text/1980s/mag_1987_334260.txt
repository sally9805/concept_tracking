J.D. Salinger may not talk much to reporters , but the author of The Catcher in the Rye does talk to his lawyers . Last year he directed them to halt publication by Random House of an unauthorized biography by Ian Hamilton . The reclusive Salinger objected to the book 's use of excerpts and summaries from scores of private letters he had written . Last week ( a busy one for literary law watchers after the Bell Jar settlement ) a Manhattan federal appeals court ordered a preliminary injunction blocking the book " in its present form . " <P> Salinger , 68 , had refused from the first to cooperate with Hamilton , literary critic for the Sunday Times of London and biographer of Poet Robert Lowell . When he was sent galleys of J.D. Salinger : A Writing Life , Salinger objected to the extensive use of letters to , among others , Ernest Hemingway and Judge Learned Hand . The correspondence , gathered primarily from university libraries , sometimes shows him at his most scabrous . In one passage cited in the court opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he had dated , married Charlie Chaplin . " I can see them at home evenings , " he wrote . " Chaplin squatting grey and nude , atop his chiffonier , swinging his thyroid around his head by his bamboo cane , like a dead rat . " <P> Salinger was no happier with revised galleys sent to him in October , in which Hamilton paraphrased many letters he had earlier quoted . By that time Salinger had copyrighted the correspondence . Although the actual letters belonged to the recipients , by law the words remained his . In court , Salinger 's lawyers argued that Hamilton went well beyond the " fair use " right of writers to describe or give examples of another 's work . The two-judge appeals panel agreed , reversing a lower court that threw out Salinger 's suit last November . The judges pointed out that the letters are used " on at least 40% of the book 's 192 pages . " Observing that the excerpts included " virtually all of the most interesting passages of the letters , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell them . <P> Random House can now appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court or try to issue the book in a more watered-down form . Salinger naturally had no comment on the court 's decision . Holden Caulfield had already spoken for him , after all . In the opening lines of The Catcher in the Rye , Salinger 's captious hero warns the reader , " I 'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography . " And not going to let anyone else tell it either .
