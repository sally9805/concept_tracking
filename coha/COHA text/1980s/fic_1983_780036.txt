 | and all were tired of the constant heat and dampness , their legs aching from long days spent kneeling in the bottom of a canoe . This was one reason why Kinich chose to sleep among them , rather than in the shelters above ; it was difficult enough to maintain morale when the men were separated in different camps , without his being absent as well . " They say there is a village ahead , " the sentry said suggestively , lingering at Kinich 's side . " All of the scouts have not returned , " Kinich said curtly . " But the plan of attack is being drawn up . We will move out as soon as the supplies left by Zotz Mac and his men are redistributed . " " They have slowed us down since the beginning , " the man said with disgust . " We are better off without them . " " Sleep , " Kinich repeated dismissively , and the man obediently found a place on the ground a few feet away and rolled himself up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of the men slept that way , knowing that the Macaws would begin their harassment as soon as the moon was down , pelting the men with stones and short spears from canoes held offshore in the darkness . The men farthest from the central island got little rest , since they were the most vulnerable to outright attack . Though he would not have said so to the sentry , Kinich could not blame Zotz Mac for taking his warriors back to Ektun . The ruler had accomplished his own objectives at the very outset of the campaign , and had come this far only out of loyalty to Shield Jaguar and Ain Caan , the son whom Caan Ac had sent in his place . Zotz Mac had argued persuasively that Ektun had little to gain from pursuing the Macaws any farther into their own territory , and he had tried to compel the other leaders to recognize the strength of the resistance they were encountering . Kinich had not been equally persuaded by the arguments for going forward , especially since those scouts who had not returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned had actually made it all the way to the rumored village . Simply choosing the correct route through the maze of waterways ahead was a matter of some embarrassment , since the maps were all incomplete and lacking corroboration . Still , Kinich had kept his misgivings to himself , feeling it would be inconsistent with his reputation , as the youngest nacom , to be found on the side of caution . It was only a matter of time before they would be forced to turn back , anyway , whether they liked it or not . This Land of the Macaws was actually more water than land , and the natives ' mastery of the terrain gave them an advantage that became more apparent every day . The Macaws ' canoes were smaller and more maneuverable than the ponderous war canoes of the allies , and their throwing sticks enabled them to strike from a distance and escape unharmed . There were more of them now , too , even though they seldom showed themselves in the daylight . They were the ones who kept changing the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs and felled trees and cutting false passages that led into dead-end swamps . On one occasion they had made a channel disappear behind a chain of log rafts camouflaged so cleverly that they could not be told from the shore on first approach . They will not give us another battle , Kinich decided as he squatted down next to the canoe , but they will certainly see that we are driven away . The camaaian had begun with what was still the allies ' most substantial  | victory , a perfectly laid ambush of a Macaw raiding party outside the town of Chinikiha . Thirty of the enemy had been killed or captured , including single-handed captures by Shield Jaguar and Zotz Mac , and an assisted capture by Ain Caan . Kinich himself had added another captive to his credit , and several of his men had been honored on the field afterward . This initial success encouraged the allies to move quickly northward , fighting occasional pitched battles with the retreating Macaws , who even then had begun putting obstacles and diversions in their way . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrorizing the villagers and leaving them to beg for aid from the army that came behind . The towns that Zotz Mac had intended to reassure with his protection were in fact devastated in advance of his arrival , and he had frequently delayed the pursuit of the Macaws , stopping to put out fires and save valuable fields from being flooded . No doubt his men were back there now , repairing dikes and helping to bury the dead . The moon was down , but even before it had disappeared completely , Kinich had been seeing dark shapes moving in the distance . The first shriek of the enemy cut through the night air like a knife , followed closely by a spear that whistled past overhead and crashed into the foliage on the island . Kinich scanned the men near him on the ground , noting with satisfaction that all of them had moved at the cry , if only to dig themselves deeper under their shields and makeshift shelters . The fighting is behind us , he thought , but we are still vigilant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let them give us a proper battlefield , he told himself longingly , and we will make them regret their boldness forever . But as he peered out over the dark water , listening to the mocking screams of the unseen enemy , he began to prepare himself for the long , tedious journey back to Tikal . Tikal THE RAIN began to fall just before daybreak , beating down on the thatched roofs of the Jaguar Paw House with unseasonable force . Hok was sleeping on the floor of the front room of Balam Xoc 's house , next to the open doorway , and he was immediately awakened by the noise and the water splashing in . He looked around at the other people in the room  --  all still asleep  --  then checked to see that his own blanket and mat were still safely rolled up beside him . He refused to use them for his own comfort , but they had been given to him by Balam Xoc , and he guarded them jealously against all possible thieves . Suddenly Balam Xoc himself emerged from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading straight for the doorway to the outside . His eyes were open , but he was completely naked , his white hair hanging loose upon his shoulders . Hok sat up and stared at him raptly with his good eye , hoping to be noticed , but Balam Xoc did not so much as blink as he walked past him and out into the rain . Hok jumped to his feet but hesitated in the doorway , daunted by the wall of rain confronting him and intensely disturbed by Balam Xoc 's nakedness . The old man was walking across the middle of the plaza , seemingly oblivious of the impact of the rain upon his unprotected body . Snatching up the blanket ,  | Hok ran out after him , slipping and stumbling down the steps as the rain took away what remained of his vision . Only by holding the blanket doubled over his head was he able to see at all , and by the time he got to the top of the steps leading down to the plaza below , Balam Xoc had already crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stairs were awash with the water pouring into the gully , and Hok made his way down with difficulty , then broke into an awkward lope across the plastered surface of the lower plaza , planting his feet wide to keep from slipping . The rain was still so intense that Hok found it hard to breathe under the shelter of his blanket , but Balam Xoc continued at the same measured pace , disappearing into the breadnut trees along the path that led to the clan reservoir . When Hok finally caught up with him , Balam Xoc had stopped on the bank overlooking the deep , oval basin , which was an artificially widened ravine . Since it was well into the dry season , the level of the water was low , and the red earth of the embankment surrounding the reservoir had silted downward , forming a thick ring around the pool at the bottom . The rain dimpling the surface of the water had begun to slacken , but the runoff poured over the eroded embankment in many places , cutting miniature gorges and valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay lining of the reservoir underneath . Balam Xoc stared downward for several moments , then knelt beside one of these rivulets , which was enlarging its channel through the embankment at his feet . Sensing that he would be as unnoticed as the rain , Hok crept closer , then closer still , until he was kneeling on the other side of the gushing stream . Balam Xoc suddenly plunged his hands into the muddy red water and brought them up cupped together , filled with clumps of earth that immediately melted in the rain and slithered away through his fingers . Cocking his head slightly , as if listening to some inner voice , he stared intently at the liquid mud cupped in his palms , mouthing words whose sound was lost in the spattering of the rain . Then he put his hands back into the water , damming the stream so that it flowed up over his wrists . Soon a small branch with a few sodden leaves still clinging to it trapped itself on his hands , and he lifted it out of the water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time Hok heard what the old man said , a single word that came out with the abrupt emphasis of a message received and acknowledged : " Wood . " Twice more Balam Xoc put his hands into the water , removing in turn a bristly cob of maize , its kernels stripped away , and a piece of orange breadnut rind . Both times he uttered the word " seed , " nodding to himself in confirmation . The rain had stopped falling with its customary abruptness , and when Balam Xoc reached down again , he found the stream receding rapidly in its gully , thickening with mud . He held his hands poised just above the surface , turning them over and flexing his fingers experimentally , as if fascinated by their capabilities . " Yes , " he said aloud . " And more hands , too . " Cupping his fingers together , he bent low over the gully , scooping up a handful of the soupy red water and raising it to his lips . But he had no more than taken it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughing  | and gagging on the mud . Hok jerked backward involuntarily , shedding the blanket hooded over his head , and Balam Xoc fell onto his hands and knees , swinging his head and spitting like an animal that had swallowed dust . Then the old man stopped , his white head hanging limply between his braced arms for a moment before he roused himself and sat back on his buttocks . The first thing he saw when he raised his eyes was Hok , regarding him anxiously from the other side of the gully . Then he looked down at his wet , naked body and up at the sky , which was beginning to lighten despite the thick layer of clouds overhead . " How did I get here ? " he asked hoarsely , wiping at the red mud still clinging to the corners of his mouth . " You walked , Grandfather , " Hok told him reverently . " As if in a dream , you walked straight to this place . " Balam Xoc nodded absently , turning his head to take in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small pile of debris he had deposited beside him . " Yes , I remember now , " he said at last , grunting as he pushed himself up out of the mud and rose to his feet . Staring out over the reservoir , he turned in a slow half-circle , surveying the thick forest that extended most of the way around the perimeter . Then he let his gaze fall upon Hok . " What did you see me do , my son ? In my dream ... " Tensing his whole body , as if to contain every memory , Hok reported what he had seen and heard , quoting the words Balam Xoc had spoken aloud . He described the way Balam Xoc had stared at his own hands , and how he had tried to drink the muddy water . " Water , " Balam Xoc repeated . " There was so much , then so little . And earth . . . land , " he mused , dislodging a chunk of red mud from the side of the gully with his toe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut and plant and collect the water . By hand ... " Nodding to himself , he looked back at Hok , whose head was cocked at its usual angle , his black hair plastered against his face and neck , his one good eye blinking quizzically . " You are my only witness , Hok . I may have to call upon you to verify the manner in which I came here . " Hok blanched , and an expression of the most abject misery came onto his emaciated face , as if he were being made to relive a bitterly painful experience . He dropped to his knees and touched his forehead to the mud in compliance , but he did not have the strength to raise himself up again . Balam Xoc stepped across the gully and lifted the prostrate man up by his elbows , finding him to be almost weightless . Hok trembled uncontrollably , and could not meet Balam Xoc 's eyes . " I have heard your story , my son , " Balam Xoc told him gently . " I know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will no doubt be disbelieved in this instance , as well , but you must stand it for my sake , and for the sake of the truth . We have no choice , Hok ; we must act upon what is shown to us . So be brave , and know that I will never deny you . " Hok was taking fast , shallow breaths , but he looked at Balam Xoc and managed a weak nod . Balam Xoc gestured toward the ground behind him . " 1 must borrow your blanket . "  | Hok turned and picked up the blanket , attempting to wring some of the water from it before offering it to Balam Xoc , who unfolded the sodden bundle and wrapped the blanket loosely around his middle . " There is much to be done . I must go , " he said curtly , and went down the embankment without a backward glance . Hok watched him disappear into the breadnut trees , then stepped across the gully and fell to his knees , pausing for a long moment before taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of breadnut rind into his own hands . Clasping them tightly against his bony chest , he lurched to his feet and went after Balam Xoc , leaving deep footprints in the red mud of the embankment . FROM THE second-floor gallery of the Jaguar Paw Clan House , Nohoch Ich looked down upon the eastern courtyard , where a small , noisy crowd of men had gathered . They were clustered around a thin , angular man whose face and body were coated with the black paint of fasting , as were those of many of the men in the crowd . Nohoch recognized the man instantly as Hok , feeling a great weariness at how familiar a sight he had become in a matter of only days . Hok with his stick and his maize cob , waving them about like holy relics in the midst of excitable crowds like this one ; Hok the witness and defender of Balam Xoc , challenging anyone , priest or lord , who doubted his master 's wisdom . As Nohoch watched , Tzec Balam , the high priest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps toward the crowd , accompanied by six large apprentice priests . Some members of the crowd immediately began to drift off at the high priest 's approach , but a core of black-painted men held their ground around Hok , who confronted Tzec Balam with unconcealed belligerence . Nohoch heard the priest 's calm command to disperse , followed by Hok 's defiant reply , a refusal so loud and harsh that it echoed off the walls of the courtyard , drawing people out of the surrounding rooms to see what could be causing such a disturbance . The clan house was a place of quiet and decorum , hardly the place for such an unseemly display of anger . Nohoch turned away in disgust , not wishing to see any more . This , too , would be blamed upon Balam Xoc , further eroding his credibility among the other members of the clan . Nohoch glanced at the curtained doorway on the other side of the gallery , waiting for his father to emerge from his conference with the Living Ancestor . Cab Coh was the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the hope that personal persuasion might accomplish what all the arguments and objections of the clan council had not . But no one had yet had any success in getting Balam Xoc to change his mind , and Nohoch doubted that his father would fare any better . The final appeal would be his own , and though he had carefully considered what he would say , he had little confidence that either care or consideration would have much weight with Balam Xoc . He was beginning to understand how his cousin Pacal had felt when he was the head of the clan council . Nohoch 's betrayal had been less personal than that of Pacal , but it had been equally sudden and unexpected . He had just finished negotiating the terms under which the clan 's workmen would he loaned to the ruler , and he had summoned the clan council to ask for their ratification and to discuss how the resulting revenues would be distributed within the clan . Ills priest 's training  | proud of the head price he had obtained , and even prouder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiators . He had convened the meeting of the council with the anticipation of much praise and mutual congratulation , especially when they came to the task of dividing up the wealth . But then Balam Xoc had put forth a proposal of his own . In return for the use of the workmen , he had declared , the ruler should be asked for the rights to certain pieces of land , and to additional woodlots and breadnut groves . Balam Xoc claimed to have received a " message " telling him to procure these essential things , along with extra stores of seed and tools for working the fields . He had also decided that some of the workmen should be retained to repair the clan reservoirs , and further , that those of his followers willing to help with the work should be adopted into the clan . If the clan was to be truly independent , even of the rains , he had proclaimed , they would need to acquire more " hands . " This had occurred almost ten days ago , yet Nohoch still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had followed Balam Xoc 's speech . Even the most impassive members could not conceal their surprise and disbelief , and several wore openly wounded expressions , as if they had just received a knife thrust in the dark . Then the objections had come pouring forth : first delicately , in deference to Balam Xoc 's position , then more pointedly as he rebuffed their suggestions , and finally with real vehemence as the council members realized that Balam Xoc had no intention of compromising  --  that his " proposal " was in fact a demand . He even knew which lands he wished to obtain . The curtain over the doorway suddenly parted , and Cab Coh came out into the gallery . Nohoch saw at a glance that he had also failed in his attempt at persuasion . " It is no use , my son , " Cab Coh murmured dejectedly . " He listens to no one . " Does he understand the seriousness of the situation ? Does he know there has been talk of his removal ? " " I warned him of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tzec Balam was speaking out against him , and that many people were listening . I told him of the anger he had aroused , even in me . But I had no effect upon him . " " I must try anyway , " Nohoch said in a determined voice , and pushed through the curtain into the chamber . Seated on the bench against the far wall , Balam Xoc seemed barely visible , for there was only one torch burning in the room , and Balam Xoc 's body was blackened with paint as a sign of his fast . His time of seclusion for the Tun-End Ceremony had begun only two days after his appearance at the council meeting , but that had not prevented him from continuing to argue on behalf of his proposal . He had simply summoned the council to attend him here , devoting his time to them rather than to the customary rituals of preparation and purification . This was another complaint Tzec Balam had against him , and one the high priest was actively exploiting to win back his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in greeting , bowing before the black-faced figure on the bench . " Sit , Nohoch . Tell me why you think I am wrong . " Nohoch settled himself on the cold stone floor , giving himself a moment to recover from the bluntness of Balam Xoc 's greeting . " I can not say that you are wrong , Grandfather , " he said judiciously . " Only  | feel that you have forgotten your duties in your quest for power , and that you will have that power at their expense . They do not think that their shares of the clan 's wealth should go to support your followers . " " They will be made to think differently . " " Perhaps , " Nohoch allowed , " but was it wrong of them to think that they , too , would profit from the city 's wealth ? They see their friends and relatives in the other clans making improvements on their houses and shrines , and trading for the goods they have lacked during these past bad seasons . It is only natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of prosperity that you yourself have brought to the clan . This was not a good time to force austerity upon them . " " There is never a good time for that , " Balam Xoc said curtly . " But there are times when it is too late even to try . We can not wait for a better time . " " Was your message ' truly so unequivocal ? " Nohoch inquired stubbornly . " You have said yourself that its larger meaning is not clear to you  --  that you do not know why we will need this land and these extra people . You do not even claim that it was the Spirit Woman who spoke to you at the reservoir . " " That does not make me doubt what I heard , or give me more faith in Caan Ac 's ability to bring the rains . Three tuns still remain to Katun Eleven Ahau . Is the ruler stronger than his prophecy ? " " Are you also a prophet , then ? Do you see what is to come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balam Xoc vowed . " I will see whatever is shown to me . And I will act on it . " " Even if you must act alone ? " Nohoch suggested , and Balam Xoc nodded without hesitation . " Even then . I am the Living Ancestor ; my duty is not defined for me by other men . " Nohoch hung his head in defeat , contemplating the shadows that danced on the floor in front of him . When he raised his eyes to Balam Xoc , he felt that he was speaking to darkness itself , so black and impenetrable did the man seem . " You told me once that you did not want me for a follower , " he said quietly . " You told me I must take back my life and change it , in order to meet the needs of the clan . I believe that I have done so , yet I am among those who disagree with the course you are forcing upon us . I must warn you , Grandfather , that the people may take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a risk I must take , " Balam Xoc replied . " But let me warn you in return : I intend to have my way in this matter . I will have the things I want before I enter my confinement , or you and the council will join me there . Tell that to Tzec Balam and the others who seek to thwart me . " Appalled by the threat , which offended him both as a priest and as a member of the council , Nohoch could only bow and take his leave , feeling a desperate need to be once more in the light , among creatures of reason . There is no tradition he will not violate , Nohoch thought as he pushed through the curtain , and no person he will not betray . Tzec Balam is right , he concluded sadly . We have given our loyalty to a madman . PAUSING for a moment to listen for sounds from the next room , Kanan Naah bent over the wooden chest and reached down into its depths , inhaling the  | opened the thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran her fingers lightly over its contents . Though many of the original items had been buried with the Lady Ik Caan , Kanan Naab knew exactly what remained , and she found the obsidian bloodletter where she remembered seeing it last . The slender black bladelet gleamed as she lifted it into the light , holding it by its bone handle and turning it to study the delicate flower that had been incised on the smooth surface of the blade . It was the precious water lily for which Kanan Naab had been named , and the reason why this blood-letter had been kept for her , for inclusion in her own marriage bundle . Then she heard the tapping of Box Ek 's stick on the steps outside , and she moved quickly to rewrap the bundle and bury it beneath the clothing she had removed earlier . Closing the lid on the chest , she stuck the blood-letter into the middle of the skein of cotton yarn she had brought for this purpose , placing the skein into a net carrying bag as she went out to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman stepped in under the thatch overhanging the doorway , out of the heat and glare of the dry-season sun . She breathed heavily for a few moments before she was able to speak . " Cab Coh has been called to the clan house again , " she reported . " He has asked that you find Akbal for him , and tell him to take charge of the craft house . " " I will go immediately , " Kanan Naab assured her , grateful for the excuse to get away with her carrying bag . But Box Ek raised a hand for her to stay . " The matchmakers from the Serpent Clan have also been to see me again . They feel that they deserve more of an answer than they have been given so far , and I agree with them . You injure Yaxal Can 's pride with your stalling . " " And he insults mine , " Kanan Naab said contentiously , " by insisting on my decision at a time like this , when it is impossible to consult with Grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balam Xoc , " Box Ek snapped . " He does as he pleases , and pays no heed to the needs of others . Do not be so foolish as to presume you are any different . " " You have always said that I am different , " Kanan Naab pointed out . " And you were there when Grandfather said he would not consent to a match unworthy of my blood . " " So Yaxal Can is unworthy of you ! You are presumptuous , Kanan Naab . But I will not argue with you . I have arranged for the matchmakers to meet with your father , in accordance with the customs of our clan . The decision is his by right , no matter what Balam Xoc has said . It is doubtful that my brother will again be allowed to abuse his authority , in this case or any other . " Kanan Naab simply stared at her , silenced by her own indignation . Box Ek glared back , her hands quivering on the top of her stick , her aged face pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger woman . " I will find Akbal , " Kanan Naab said finally , and Box Ek moved aside to let her pass through the doorway and out into the bright sunlight . Kanan Naab went down the steps without looking back , and did not stop walking until she had turned the corner of her father 's house and was standing in front of the open doorway to Akhal 's old room . Then she began to shake , and she had to clench her fists and press them tightly against her cheeks to prevent her tears from falling . She felt her world slipping away from her , her future being taken  | Xoc , the man she trusted above all others . There seemed to be no one left to whom she could turn for comfort . Yet gradually she managed to calm herself and hold back her tears . She could not give way to her despair , or she would be lost , swept away by the same forces that were assailing Balam Xoc . She decided that she had to talk to Akbal immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But first she went into her brother 's old room , threading her way between the neat stacks of folded drawings , which she herself had arranged in a loose semicircle around the shaft of light that entered through the doorway . Taking the skein of yarn that held the blood-letter out of her carrying bag , she hid it under a pile of old mats in the corner , murmuring a brief , apologetic prayer for having to sequester it in such an unsanctified place . Then she stood for a moment in the midst of the drawings , dwelling on the possibility they had presented to her , a possibility that was coming to seem more real and necessary with each passing day . She was not certain that she had the courage to attempt a vision of her own , but desperation was pushing her hard in that direction . Upon leaving the room , she turned in the direction of Akbal 's stone , hoping that he might surprise her by being there . It was a slender hope , since he seldom even visited his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her presence since shortly after his marriage . That was five months ago , yet his infatuation with Zac Kuk seemed only to have grown , to the point where his general unavailability was no longer amusing . This was not the first time that Cab Coh or someone else had sent her to find him , usually with the angry admonition to look in the vicinity of his wife . Even Chan Mac , recently arrived in Tikal , had complained of his friend 's preoccupied state , and of the ambitions Akbal seemed to have forsaken . Kanan Naab 's hope turned to irritation when she entered the clearing before the breadnut trees and found the stone and its shelter unattended . She noticed , however , that others had not forsaken the Serpent Stone . Kal Cuc had made visible progress in cleaning and sanding the stone 's pitted surface , and some unknown person or persons had left offerings at the base of the slab : a small pottery bowl filled with sticky balls of copal , some flakes of pink flint , scraps of white paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone was smudged and gritty with the remains of fires where copal had been burned to purify the offerings . Perhaps they will force him to attend to his task , Kanan Naab thought hopefully , gazing down at the offerings . One night someone had left a whole core of obsidian here , a piece as big as a man 's fist , which Akbal had subsequently traded for maize to distribute to the poorer families of the clan . That was the last time , to her knowledge , that he had paid any attention to the needs of the poor , which had been an obsession of his for months after his return from the west . Kanan Naab wondered if he had any memory left of the hungry people he had seen on the trail from Uaxactun . " The spirit of the Jaguar Paw is a memory in your blood , " she recalled . " You have only to let yourselves remember . " She abruptly turned away from the stone , deciding that Akbal had to be reminded of his duty , whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed him now ; she needed him , and she could not wait for him to come to his senses on his own . Perhaps together they could find a way to defend Balam Xoc from his doubters , or at least speak out on his behalf . Perhaps it was already too late to intervene , but she could not stand  | The path through the breadnut trees was dark and cool , sheltered from the intense heat of the sun by the leafy canopy high overhead . Kanan Naab walked quickly , ignoring the flash of brightly colored birds in the undergrowth and the rustle of small creatures fleeing at her approach . The path came out behind Akbal 's house , but she slowed when the sound of laughter drifted to her ears , then stopped altogether at the edge of the grove , hidden by the shade of the tall trees , when she saw Akbal and Zac Kuk ahead . They were standing close together , almost leaning upon one another , beneath the tree that served as a perch for Zac Kuk 's pets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , his long black tail twitching occasionally for balance , and Akbal was pointing up at the monkey with one hand , laughing as he spoke . His other arm was draped loosely around Zac Kuk 's back , and even as he continued speaking , his long fingers moved down to cup one of her buttocks and pull her closer against him . Zac Kuk rose up on one foot and curled her thigh around his leg , rubbing her breasts against his ribs . Smiling her brilliant smile , she looked up at his face and laid a hand flat upon his bare stomach , then very deliberately slid the hand down into the folds of his loincloth . Kanan Naab held her breath in shock , stunned by the casual boldness of the exchange , and by the fact that it was being performed so publicly . She moved deeper into the shadows , unable to tear her eyes away , yet possessed by a shameful fear of being caught in the act of watching . The pair under the tree , however , seemed oblivious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapt pleasure on Akbal 's face as he nuzzled Zac Kuk 's cheek , his eyes closed and his hips undulating in concert with the hand in his loincloth , which appeared to have doubled in size . Then Akbal looked down at himself and laughed , and whispered something in Zac Kuk 's ear . Still entangled , the couple turned abruptly , bumping hips , and staggered toward the doorway of the house behind them . Chuen swung in a loop around his branch , chattering shrilly , his teeth bared in a monkey grin . Akbal absently waved a hand at him , then ducked his head and disappeared through the doorway behind Zac Kuk . Staying just long enough to be sure that no one else had been observing this scene , Kanan Naab turned and walked slowly back through the trees . Her cheeks were hot , and her skin tingled with a nervous energy that seemed to ebb and flow ; the path beneath her feet appeared very far away , barely within her power to focus upon . She remembered the night her grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling her to seek the truth and let it make its mark upon her . She knew now that it was futile to search any longer outside herself . The time had come to awaken the memories in her blood .. . The Land of the Macaws KIN K 'll KAKMOO sat in the rear of the canoe , flanked by two of the six paddlers who propelled the heavy dugout through the water . Ten of his men knelt in pairs in front of him , their quilted cotton armor stained with sweat , their shields raised in anticipation of a sudden attack from the shore . If the scouts  | was alert for every sign of the ambush he knew was coming . He had not expected that they would get this far , given the ferocity of the Macaw resistance , but they had met with no opposition since fighting their way past the last barricade . Surely the clear water ahead had to be deceptive ; he could not believe that the Macaws would choose to meet them on the ground outside their village . His canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men  --  were in the vanguard of the fleet , which was strung out behind them for some distance . The third part of his command was back guarding Ain Caan , who was situated safely in the middle of the line , along with Shield Jaguar and the other rulers . The tree-lined channel through which they were passing was wide but quite shallow at the edges , so that the canoes were forced to stay two abreast in the center of the stream . The sun glittered blindingly off the slow-moving green water , and the only visible movement was that of the vultures overhead , cutting lazy circles in the sky . Suddenly a shout went up behind him , and Kinich glanced back over his shoulder in time to see an enormous tree come crashing down across the channel , capsizing the canoes beneath it and effectively severing the fleet in two . The boatmen trapped water with their paddles in confusion , causing the canoes to slew and drift , throwing up waves . Then the shore on both sides came alive with a chorus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them . Ducking under his shield , Kinich quickly assessed the situation behind him , seeing that one canoe had already beached itself in an attempt to get around the fallen tree and that its occupants were being slaughtered by the spear throwers on the shore . " Forward ! " he shouted , and waved to the canoe behind , urging them to follow . Perhaps they could find a place to land and dig themselves in , holding off the enemy until the rest of the fleet could cut their way past the tree and come to the rescue . But then he looked ahead , past the high , painted bow of the canoe , and saw canoes filled with red-crested warriors pouring into the channel from its branches and tributaries farther downstream . The thought of dying went through him with a searing rush , sharp and enervating , but he continued to urge the paddlers onward . His second canoe was right behind him , but most of the others were falling back , slewing sideways in indecision . Kinich desperately scanned the shoreline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he noticed a section to his left where the vegetation seemed lower and less dense . As his eyes fixed upon it , the whole section seemed to lift and roll with an incoming wave . " Left ! " he roared , pointing to the spot . The paddler next to him suddenly collapsed with a spear in his side , and Kinich jerked the paddle from the dying man 's hands and dug in awkwardly in his place . As they bore down upon the shore at full stroke , its falseness became apparent to all of them , and they redoubled their efforts with a hopeful cry , aiming their canoes for the place where the most light showed through the camouflage . " Break through it ! " Kinich commanded , pulling in his paddle at the last instant as the high bow of the canoe rammed into the wooden floats with a jarring crunch , pitching a Macaw hidden among the vegetation into the water . The second canoe hit an instant later , breaking the floats apart and revealing the open channel that lay beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the men resumed paddling with the frenzied energy of escape , shouting incoherently in their gratitude and relief . The sounds of the ambush receded behind them as they turned the first bend in the channel , seeing no one in pursuit and no one coming out ahead to block their flight . Kinich briefly broke rhythm with the other paddlers to count his men , and saw that he had come through with fifteen warriors and nine of the original twelve boatmen . A force to be reckoned with , he thought , at least on land . They were wending their way through a dense , unbroken jungle , and as the stream began to turn and twist back upon itself , taking them farther and farther from the channel they had left , he began to feel the hopelessness of their ever finding their way back to the rest of the fleet . Especially before the Macaws found them . Glancing up at the sun , he realized that they were heading roughly southeast , in the direction of Tikal . Homeward , he thought longingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfamiliar motions of paddling . Then they came around a bend and saw the barricade across the channel ahead , and Kinich 's mind was made up for him . For the first time , he was grateful for the Macaws ' talent for creating obstacles , since it would lend credence to what he knew would be an unpopular command . As soon as they had made a landing next to the barricade , he jumped out into the water and threw his paddle into the bottom of the canoe with a clatter that attracted everyone 's attention . " Drag the canoes into the jungle and conceal them , " he said forcefully . " We go on foot from here . " The men stopped where they were , gaping at him in disbelief . " We do not know where this channel leads , or how many more barricades there might be , " Kinich explained . " The Macaws are certain to come after us , and we are no match for them on the water . But let them come into the jungle after us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the kind of fighting we know . " " But we do not know this land , " one of the older warriors protested , " and it is not fit for foot travel . " " No , but we are , " Kinich reminded them . " Would you prefer to meet your end kneeling in a canoe , an easy target for the Macaw spear throwers ? Or would you rather fight them in the jungle , where their weapon is use-less ? " " Ain Caan will search for us , " someone else suggested without much conviction . " We might be accused of desertion . " " Is it not worse to let ourselves be killed or captured ? " Kinich scoffed . " I am the nacom . I will accept all responsibility once we are back in Tikal . But first I will see that we get there safely , and together . " The boatmen cast uneasy glances at the vine-choked jungle and murmured among themselves , but the warriors nodded one by one , accepting the wisdom of Kinich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose it upon them . " It is a long journey , " one of them remarked , as they began the task of pushing the heavy canoes into the undergrowth . " The Sun is my namesake , " Kinich said fiercely , baring his jeweled teeth as he put his shoulder against the dripping stern of the canoe and pushed . " He will guide us home . "  | WITH LESS than two months left until the planting , the atmosphere in the chamber of the chief steward of crops was tense and harried , with scribes , messengers , and stewards hurrying in and out in a steady stream . But when Chac Mut came through the doorway , Pacal called a temporary halt to the activity and cleared the room , gesturing for the young man to sit beside him . His former assistant , now a full steward , had been acting as Pacal 's representative at the negotiations with the Jaguar Paw Clan , which had gone on far longer than anyone had expected . " The negotiations are over ? " Pacal asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to wholly conceal his smugness . " Balam Xoc has been satisfied , " he reported . " He has sent my father and the other negotiators home , and has finally retired with the clan priests . " " Did he stay for the exchange of documents ? " " He had to . He could not trust his clansmen to uphold the agreements in his absence . They were not satisfied . " Pacal grunted softly , glancing once at the maps and deeds spread out on the floor beside him . He had not expected to have any hand at all in the negotiations with the clan , but Balam Xoc 's unprecedented demand for land rights had brought the matter under the jurisdiction of the chief steward of crops . Which in turn had put Pacal in the uniquely perverse position of being able to accede to his father 's wishes , yet in a way that could only hasten Balam Xoc 's downfall . It seemed a peculiar sort of revenge , especially since it had not been sought . " Has there been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked , and Chac Mut shrugged in the same smug manner . " They do not have to say it ; it is in their faces . They were all enormously embarrassed by Balam Xoc 's participation in the bargaining , when he had already put on the paint of his fast . It is too close to the Tun-End Ceremony for Tzec Balam to act now , but I am told that he has already discussed the matter with Ah Kin Cuy . " " So my father will dance once more , " Pacal concluded in a musing tone , his gaze traveling past Chac Mut . " Even that can not make much of a difference now , " the young man assured him confidently . " He has neglected his followers as well as his ceremonial duties during these last days , and many of them have begun to question the holiness of his purpose . All except for that madman Hok , and the others who think they will be adopted into the clan . " " He would have helped himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or simply by claiming that his message ' had come from the Spirit Woman . Does it not make you wonder why he did neither ? " Chac Mut squinted at him curiously , then frowned , as if the question made him impatient . " Forgive me , Uncle , but surely I do not have to remind you of his incredible arrogance . " " You do not , " Pacal bristled , his eyes flaring with anger . For a moment he seemed about to lose control of himself , but then the impulse passed , and he  | was again impassive . " You may return to your duties . Before you go , though , tell me what news you have heard concerning the warriors . " Obviously unprepared for the question , Chac Mut could only shrug his shoulders . " I must confess , I did not even think to ask . Surely , though , they must have taken the Macaw village by now . Perhaps Ain Caan and Kinich Kakmoo are counting their captives at this very moment . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest report is sent to me . I may be responsible only for the crops , but that does not mean my knowledge should shrink to fit my official duties . You should consider that yourself , Steward . " " Of course , my lord , " Chac Mut replied in a chastened tone , though he seemed more puzzled than contrite . He rose to his feet , bowed politely , and left the chamber with measured steps . Watching him go , Pacal realized that the reprimand would have no useful effect upon the young man , and had only been a response to his own insecurity and frustration . The wholeness of knowledge that had been the mark of the stewardship could not be recovered by browbeating Chac Mut . It had been sacrificed to the ruler 's ambitions , along with the cooperation that had once existed among the stewards themselves . Now they were all intent upon enlarging and defending their separate areas of influence , and were too busy fighting with one another to pose any serious opposition to him . Caan Ac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had described to Pacal , delegating all of his responsibilities except that of bringing the rains , yet surrendering none of his power to determine the city 's ultimate course . So far , even to Pacal 's wary eye , the plan seemed to be working . The campaign against the Macaws had been going well at last report , trade had been expanded in several directions , including the south and east , and the size of the harvest had indeed produced the trust Caan Ac had predicted . The Jaguar Paw Clan had been virtually alone in demanding payment rather than the promise of future bonuses , and it now appeared that there would be enough workmen available , beyond those assigned to the Katun Enclosure , to satisfy Pacal 's minimal requirements for the next crop . The harvest would by no means be as large as the last one , but there would be an ample surplus if the weather was again kind . If Pacal reflected ominously , surveying the array of stiff paper screens spread out beside him . In addition to offending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff work long hours to give him the thing he wanted . He had known what he wanted , even if he had done an inadequate job of explaining why . And if his suspicions , however vaguely expressed , were correct  --  if the rains proved unreliable and the crops died in the fields  --  then the Jaguar Paw would be the only clan equipped with the means to provide for itself . And Balam Xoc would be praised for his foresight , just as he was now being condemned for his conservatism . It was this possibility , so personally threatening to Pacal , that made him hesitant about dismissing his father from consideration . In just a few days , Balam Xoc would enter his confinement , and who could say what vision might come to him this time ? Nor was there any way to predict the effect of his dancing , which had had as powerful an impact on the people as his words .  | Balam Xoc had surprised him too many times in the past for Pacal to relax his vigilance now . Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven , by the very extremity of Balam Xoc 's actions , to entertain the opposite conclusion : that Balam Xoc was right , and had acted with a wisdom unavailable to anyone else . " We will see , " Pacal murmured aloud , hearing the tremor of doubt in his own voice . Clapping his hands to banish the sound , he summoned his servants and told them to remove the documents and return them to the House of Records . " Quickly , " he commanded with sudden urgency . " The rainy season is only two months away , and we must be ready for it . We must all be ready ... " ON THE NIGHT before the Tun-End Ceremony , Zac Kuk crossed the bridge over the gully and began to climb the stairs to the upper plaza , carrying a torch to light her way . Upon reaching the middle landing , she was startled by rustling sounds off to her left , along the terrace , and she stopped and pointed the torch in that direction , holding it in front of herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared out of the avocado trees , causing Zac Kuk to take an involuntary step backward , though she raised the torch overhead when she realized who it was . " My lady ... " " I can not find Kanan Naab , " Ixchel announced , seeming unaware that she had startled Zac Kuk , or that there was anything unusual in being out here in the dark . " You have not seen her ? " " I was hoping to speak to her myself , " Zac Kuk confessed . " Why would she be here ? " " She has been acting strangely lately . I thought perhaps she had gone to her mother 's bench to be alone . " Ixchel gestured vaguely toward the darkness behind her . " It is there , among the trees on the terrace . " " Yes , " Zac Kuk said , though it was the first she had heard of such a bench . She felt a renewed sense of the guilt and uncertainty that had brought her looking for Kanan Naab , the sense that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's people and that she had put off learning it for too long . " Where else might she be ? " she prompted , and Ixchel forced herself to think , clasping and unclasping her hands nervously . Then her narrow face brightened with inspiration . " The Serpent Stone ! " she exclaimed , and turned for the stairs . " Let us go there . " Zac Kuk hurried after her , extending the torch to illuminate the steep steps as they climbed to the plaza above . Only belatedly did she realize that Ixchel was referring to the stone that belonged to Akbal , the one his grandfather had given him to carve . She had never heard Akbal call it by that name , though he had told her about the serpent that had guarded it . Did he know that others called it that , she wondered , grateful that Ixchel had been in too much haste to notice her ignorance of the title . So much you do not understand , she told  | herself accusingly , struggling to match strides with the taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had started down the path between the end of the house and the gully when Ixchel suddenly stopped and pointed to the curtained doorway to their right . " The curtain is down , " she said urgently , as if the fact had some special significance for her . Not pausing to explain , she pushed aside the cloth and stepped up into the room , with Zac Kuk not far behind . The flickering light sent shadows flying into the corners , revealing the stacks of drawings , and then the body lying crumpled on the floor . Ixchel gasped and clutched Zac Kuk 's free arm , so hard that the torch in her other hand wavered and dipped , casting its glare fully upon the bloodstained form of Kanan Naab . " She has killed herselfl " Ixchel hissed , and began to weep convulsively . Zac Kuk stared at the motionless figure , too shocked to comprehend what she was seeing . But finally she noticed the blood-letter lying on the floor near Kanan Naab 's hand , and the spilled bag of copal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Freeing herself from Ixchel 's paralyzing grasp , she stuck the torch into the wall niche beside the doorway and knelt down next to Kanan Naab , feeling for her throat . " She is alive ! " she cried out in relief . " Ixchel , she is alive ! Quickly , we must have water , and medicines . And a blanket . Her skin is very cold . Quickly , Ixchel ! " Still wiping at her eyes , Ixchel moved slowly toward the door , as if walking in her sleep . Zac Kuk rose and guided her out , pressing a hand encouragingly on the older woman 's back . " And tell no one else about this , " she urged , pulling the curtain back across the doorway before returning to Kanan Naab . Half kneeling and half sitting , she managed to lift the unconscious woman 's head and shoulders off the floor , cradling her in her lap and wrapping the long folds of her skirt around her for warmth . Blood was smeared across Kanan Naab 's face and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift was soaked through with it . Zac Kuk began to weep at the sight of her sister-in-law 's tattered earlobes and the multiple lacerations on her shins and forearms , imagining the pain Kanan Naab had inflicted upon herself , and the despair that must have driven her to such an act of penance . She would be scarred forever , if she survived this .. . Suddenly Kanan Naab shivered and opened her eyes , which seemed filmy at first and unable to focus . She blinked slowly , laboriously , as if her eyelids were very heavy , rolling her eyes to take in her surroundings . Then she looked up at Zac Kuk , and to the latter 's complete astonishment , she smiled . " Greetings , my sister , " she whispered , and Zac Kuk squeezed her shoulders reassuringly , taking the smile as a sign of delirium . " Please , you must save your strength , " she urged . " Ixchel has gone for medicines and a blanket . " " I am fine , " Kanan Naab insisted , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to health . Her eyes , though , were clear enough to see the tears on Zac Kuk 's cheeks . " But why are you weeping ? " " We thought you were dead ! " Zac Kuk blurted , her eyes tearing anew at the memory . " Oh , Kanan Naah , why did you do this to yourself ' ? " " It was my offering to the ancestors , " Kanan Naah breathed reverently.  | " They put courage into my hand and made my flesh open easily . There was no pain . " " But why ? This was not required of you . The whole clan has done penance for the Tun-End . " " It was an offering , " Kanan Naab repeated . " I saw him , Zac Kuk . I saw Grandfather . . . the Jaguar Protector . " Zac Kuk was now certain that Kanan Naab was delirious , but she decided to keep her talking if she could , knowing that it would be easier to tend to her if she were conscious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream ? " " I went to him , " Kanan Naab said simply , as if describing an actual experience . " He was standing near the entrance to a cave , a deep , dark place . His arms and legs were covered with spotted fur , and his eyes were no longer those of a man . They were large and yellow , and they glowed at me out of the blackness , like the eyes of a jaguar ... " At this point Ixchel pushed her way through the curtain , her arms filled with blankets and various bundles piled almost to her chin , and a bowl of water balanced precariously on the top . She had regained her composure , though , and managed to set down her load without spilling any of it . Together , she and Zac Kuk raised Kanan Naab into a sitting position and began to wash the blood off her face and neck with wet cloths . Murmuring apologetically , they pushed back her hair and dabbed tentatively at her lacerated earlobes , watching her eyes for signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself patiently to their ministrations , not even wincing as they removed the crust of blood from her wounds . Zac Kuk and Ixchel exchanged a glance , simultaneously struck by how clean and evenly spaced the cuts were , indicating the extraordinary steadiness of the hand that had made them . They seemed already to be closing , and did not resume bleeding even after being washed . When Ixchel daubed cut medicine on them , however , the sting brought tears to Kanan Naab 's eyes and made her stifle a cry of pain . " We must remove your clothing , " Ixchel suggested softly . " Are you warm enough ? " " Do whatever you must , " Kanan Naab agreed wearily , hanging limply in their arms while they pulled the blood-soaked shift off over her head and untied the skirt from her waist . Sponging her body clean , they dried her quickly and helped her into a clean shift , then wrapped her tightly in a warm blanket of cotton interwoven with rabbit-fur thread . Kanan Naab managed a weak smile when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . I am grateful to you both . " " We have told no one else about this , " Zac Kuk assured her . " Perhaps we can disguise your wounds with paint and powder . " Kanan Naab turned toward her with a bemused expression upon her face . " There is no need for secrecy . I am not ashamed of what I have done . Balam Xoc spoke to me . He told me not to be afraid , but to go back to the world of men and wait for him there . He said that it was too soon for me to come to him . " " You had a vision ? " lxchel inquired in a tremulous voice , and Kanan Naab nodded , still looking at Zac Kuk.  | " It was no mere dream , my sister . I saw him and heard him , and I understood many things he did not even say . He will not be the same when he emerges from his confinement . He is completing his transformation . He is taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can lead us to safety . You will see this yourself when he dances tomorrow . " " You must rest , then , " Zac Kuk cautioned , " if you are to be strong enough to attend . " " I am Jaguar Paw , " Kanan Naab asserted boldly , gesturing for them to help her to her feet . " I will be strong enough . " Keeping the blanket bundled around her , the other two women lifted her into a standing position and held her upright between them , bracing her under the elbows when she swayed dizzily and seemed about to fall . Sweat broke out on her forehead , but then she sighed and gave them a giddy smile . " And if I am not , " she added less firmly , " you must see that I am carried there . You must ... " " We will , " Ixchel promised fervently , only an instant before Zac Kuk made the same pledge , so that their voices overlapped like an echo . Binding Kanan Naab between them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving her garments and her ritual implements where they lay , scattered across the bloodstained floor . The Tun-End 9.17.17.0.0 10 Ahau i3 Kankin AS THE SUN approached his midpoint in the sky , Nohoch Ich and Tzec Balam , the high priest of the clan , stood together on the platform in front of the Shrine of the Jaguar Protector . Below them , at the base of the steep temple stairs , was the plain stone monument that belonged to the Living Ancestor , and they watched carefully as the shadow cast by the tall yellow slab gradually shrank in around it , indicating the arrival of noon . The plaza area beyond the monument was packed solid with people , lords with gaudy headwraps and necklaces of jade and shell standing shoulder to shoulder with black-painted pilgrims whose heads were bare beneath the burning heat of the Sun . The crowd was so large that it spilled out of the plaza on both sides , and some of the women in the rear had climbed up the terraced back of the huge Sky Clan temple that limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat and glare of the Sun , which reflected harshly off the plastered surfaces of the surrounding temples , Nohoch sensed a great restlessness in the crowd , which seemed to ripple and sway before his eyes , moved by conflicting currents of anxiety and expectation . When the proper moment had been reached , Tzec Balam signaled to the drummers seated next to the monument , and as they began to pound on their heavy log drums , he and Nohoch reentered the shrine through its central doorway . The apprentices and costumers who were crowded into the narrow front room moved aside for them , holding their implements and costume paraphernalia away from their bodies , which were running with sweat . The atmosphere in the cramped chamber was hot and sticky , smelling strongly of  | the men 's bodies and the copal they had burned during their three-day vigil for the Living Ancestor . Many times during this period , they had all heard Balam Xoc cry out and speak to himself , though none of his words had been distinguishable through the thick wall that separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear whatever Balam Xoc would tell them when he emerged . He was weary , and his eyes burned from the smoke , and he felt a persistent irritation  --  an unwillingness to be here  --  that he had never before experienced in all his days as a priest . It was too late for justifications , he thought ; too late for words alone to restore the trust and respect that had been lost . Just as the steady beating of the drums had begun to lull Nohoch with their rhythm , Balam Xoc suddenly emerged from the inner doorway , throwing the thick curtain aside with a vigorous gesture . Except for a few dusty smudges on his chest , the old man 's naked body was completely free of its fasting paint , and his unblinking eyes made no concessions to the light in the room . He seemed to glare at all of them , projecting an anger so clear and piercing that Nohoch was instantly afraid of him , stricken with a fear of punishment such as he had not experienced since childhood . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion in that face , which had remained impassive through even the most heated arguments with the clan council . Balam Xoc 's glare narrowed in upon Tzec Balam , who straightened up rather than bowing , his eyes hooded with disdain . Beside him was the costumer who held the plumed train of feathers that Balam Xoc had refused to wear at the last ceremony  --  an article that Tzec Balam had insisted would be used this time . The hair rose on the back of Nohoch 's neck at the sound of the low , grating growl that came from Balam Xoc 's throat as he crossed the room and snatched the plumed regalia from the hands of the frightened costumer . Then he took two more steps and threw the feathers out through the open doorway , evoking a chorus of muted cries from the people in the plaza below . " You will learn to honor my wishes , Tzec Balam , " he threatened , confronting the priest face to face . " Or I will discard you in the same manner . " Tzec Balam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he turned on his heel to leave the chamber . But Balam Xoc clamped a hand on his shoulder and held him , and the priest jerked to a stop in surprise , his eyes fastening frantically upon the hand on his shoulder , as if it had caused him some bewildering pain . " Yes , feel the coldness of my purpose , " Balam Xoc whispered fiercely . " Feel its power , and its sacredness . You will not be so foolish as to oppose me again . " Tzec Balam grimaced , the tendons in his neck standing out like cords as he strained against the relentless pressure of Balam Xoc 's hand and voice . Then his legs buckled and his mouth went slack , and he sank slowly to his knees . Everyone else in the room knelt with him , though Nohoch raised his head when he felt Balam Xoc standing over him . " You have also doubted me , Nohoch Ich , " the old man accused him . " But before the next tun has ended , you will once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear a wound meant for me  --  there ! " Balam Xoc suddenly pointed toward Nohoch 's right hip , and a sharp jolt of pain seemed to burst against his pelvis , throwing his body into a protective tuck . He gasped and clutched at his hip , only to find that the pain had  | " Your body knows what comes to you , " Balam Xoc said scornfully . " Why does your spirit turn away ? " Trembling all over , Nohoch touched his forehead to the floor , the only way he knew to express his fear and astonishment . From above him , he heard Balam Xoc 's voice , sounding impatient now that he had made them all cower before him . " Dress me , " he commanded sharply . " Today I will speak to the people , after I have danced for them ... " PRESSED IN among the other women at the rear of the crowd , Zac Kuk felt herself fusing with the mass of bodies in the plaza , her sense of separateness melting away in the devastating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radiated upward through the bare soles of her feet . She felt at times that everyone was breathing in unison , and that the next breath might lift them all off the ground . Then some spasm of movement or a raised voice elsewhere in the crowd would break the spell , and she would be aware of herself again , aware of the perspiration cutting trails through the yellow powder she had applied to her face , and of the limp strands of hair coming uncoiled upon her shoulders . She had only to glance sideways at her sister-in-law , though , to make her own dishevelment seem a petty concern . There were dark rings beneath Kanan Naab 's eyes and an unhealthy cast to her skin , and the deep creases beside her nose and mouth did not belong on so young a face . Zac Kuk had pleaded for the chance to make her up , but Kanan Naab would have none of it , just as she had insisted upon coming here under her own power . She wore the signs of her bloodletting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bravely that Zac Kuk had come to see the inappropriateness of her own pleading . She had also seen the reactions of the other clan women , especially those whose husbands were opposed to Balam Xoc , and their obvious disapproval had only made Kanan Naab 's display of loyalty that much more impressive and singular . Drums began to beat , and Zac Kuk turned her eyes toward the front , arching her neck to see over the heads of the men . The two priests who had been standing in front of the shrine 's central doorway  --  one of whom she had recognized as Akbal 's uncle  --  had disappeared . The shrine itself seemed small to her , especially when compared with the towering Sky Clan temples on the lower terrace . It was painted totally red and stood upon a pyramidal platform of only nine steps , and its high , tapering roof comb was set back upon the vaulted roof , thrusting into the sky like a headdress . Unlike the graceful , latticed roof combs of Ektun , which seemed to float above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated with elaborate stucco serpents and a large mask of the Night Sun Jaguar . There were three doorways in the front of the shrine , but the outer two had been covered with red curtains , making the facade appear closed and impenetrable , as if great secrets were hidden within . As she thought this , a long train of bluish-green feathers suddenly came flying out through the central doorway , hanging suspended in the air for an instant , like a diaphanous green snake , before settling in a heap halfway down  | was buffeted by the cries that broke forth spontaneously from many throats . The Featherless Dancer , she thought , thrilled and slightly frightened by the provocativeness of the gesture , and by the excitement it had touched off in the people around her . She could feel their mood quicken , rising to the tempo of the drums . She turned again toward Kanan Naab , and saw a smile curling the edges of her sister-in-law 's lips , though her gaze was firmly fixed upon the shrine . Now I will begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something extraordinary was about to happen , something that would take her into the very heart of what it meant to be Jaguar Paw . The feathers lay where they had fallen , and the crowd itself seemed to hang suspended , hardly breathing as they waited for the ceremony to commence . The clan priests finally reappeared , carrying staves and threepronged implements , and behind them came the Living Ancestor , seeming huge and ungainly in his jaguar costume . They descended the stairs one by one , the priests carefully sidestepping the train of feathers . Balam Xoc , though , paused for a moment on the step above , then hooked the feathers with the end of his staff and thrust them contemptuously out of the way , a gesture that caused many in the crowd to cry out over the drums , voicing their anger or approval . Then Zac Kuk 's view of him was obscured by the ranks of men in front of her , and she could only see the spotted head , with the water lily attached to its ear , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tall stone monument at the base of the temple steps . Once mounted upon his pedestal , however , the whole head and upper body of the Jaguar were clearly visible to her , framed against the blank yellow background of the monument . Holding his staff and the three-pronged red " paw " at his sides , he stood facing the people , the great jaws gaping widely around the shadowed face within . The drumming ceased abruptly , and as the last , vibrating echoes died away , the figure on the pedestal turned toward the west and began to chant the song of the Night Sun Jaguar , the Sun who went beneath the earth each night , traveling through the nine levels of the Underworld to reach his place of rising in the east . Singing in a droning , hypnotic voice , Balam Xoc mimicked the trials faced by the Night Sun Jaguar : the torments of cold and fire he suffered in his descent to the watery depths of the Underworld ; the Wind of Knives that shredded his body ; the menacing spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jaguars ; the death and transformation he would undergo before reascending to the sky . Zac Kuk could not understand many of the words , but the story of the Night Sun Jaguar had been known to her since childhood . His journey through the Underworld was the same one that would be taken by the ruler of Ektun upon his death , so that he might ascend to the Place of the Ancestors and watch over the lives of the people who remained upon the earth . This was true as well of the rulers of Tikal and all the other cities , and , as she had been told , of the Living Ancestor of the Jaguar Paw Clan , who claimed the Night Sun Jaguar as their patron spirit , the Jaguar Protector . As Balam Xoc brought his song to a conclusion , Zac Kuk realized that her own involvement in the rite  --  which she had never seen enacted before  --  was  | much deeper than that of the people around her . They were waiting for the dancing she had been told would follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaths in the intense heat , during the brief silence that hung over the plaza when Balam Xoc had finished . Suddenly a cough echoed out over them , the hollow , angry sound of a jaguar in the night , a sound that Zac Kuk had heard only once or twice in her life , and always in the jungle . The cough was repeated several times , louder and louder , as if the beast were coming closer , moving in for the kill . Then a blood-chilling scream erupted from the jaws of the Jaguar on the stone , who reared back and raised his staff and claws over his head , and began to dance as the drumming started up behind him . Stiffening with fear , Zac Kuk recoiled from the scream , jostling against the people around and behind her . A woman to her left rolled back her eyes and fainted , and men began to fall in the crowd ahead of her , taking their fellows down with them . The Jaguar had danced in a circle , turning his back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long , spotted tail shaking rapidly behind him . The drums rose to a thunderous pitch , matched by the pumping legs of the Jaguar , who suddenly jumped and spun completely around in the air , thrusting his staff and claws directly at the crowd as he landed . He screamed again , a piercing shriek that cut through the din of the drums and seemed to embed itself in Zac Kuk 's flesh . She felt herself falling , her eyes closing of their own accord , until a hand caught her by the arm and brought her back to consciousness . She hung onto Kanan Naab 's hand as waves of color passed in front of her eyes and her heart pounded in time with the drums , the horrible screams of the Jaguar raking at her ears . She felt the crowd melting away around her , and when she was able to raise her eyes , she saw many of the women prostrate upon the ground , and the men ahead of her kneeling before the Jaguar on the pedestal . Only a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront each of them in turn , snarling and spitting and pointing his red claw until they also fell to their knees . Still clinging to Kanan Naab , Zac Kuk located Akbal kneeling among the front ranks , his bright blue headwrap rising above the heads of the men around him . She clung to the sight of him as well , praying for an end to her fear . Waving his staff to silence the drums , the Jaguar let out a final , menacing roar that seemed to resound inside Zac Kuk 's head , deafening her to the cries that came from her own throat as she saw Akbal stiffen and collapse onto the man in front of him . Then it was quiet . Zac Kuk felt herself being shaken , and came to in a haze of yellow spots , though still standing on her feet . Kanan Naab steadied her , staring into her eyes until clarity returned . Then she released Zac Kuk to stand on her own and turned to help Ixchel , who was holding Box Ek upright against her chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also turned to help when a sudden murmuring in the crowd made her look again toward the front . Balam Xoc had resumed his place on the pedestal after leaving it , having removed the Jaguar head from around his own and given his staff and claws to the priests . He spread his arms wide and addressed them in a commanding voice :  | " Three tuns remain to Katun Eleven Ahau , my people ! Who will you follow in the time ahead ? " The crowd fell absolutely silent as he swept them with his gaze , letting his arms drop momentarily to his sides . Then he raised one hand , his fingers curling upward and out , as if to seize their attention from the air . " I say to you that the ruler will lead you to your destruction ! He does not have the power to alter the course of his prophecy ; he can not summon the rains as he has promised . This you will know soon enough , for the rains will come early , and then leave the crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muted groan went up from the kneeling men , and Balam Xoc pointed a finger at them unsparingly . " I say to you as well that the warriors have been defeated , and many have been lost . The only spoils of this war will be sorrow ! This , too , I have seen . " Balam Xoc raised his other arm and held his palms out to them , altering his tone only slightly , yet in a way that seemed immensely reassuring to Zac Kuk , who had felt her fear beginning to return . " We must live again in the way of our most ancient ancestors , " he told them , " dependent only on ourselves for the food and water that give us life . Dependent only on the spirits of our ancestors for the wisdom to guide us . The katun prophecy concerns us no more . We are done with it , and will pay its prophet no more honor . " He lowered his arms and looked out over them , concluding his speech with great deliberateness , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been broken . No one may hide again , no one may avoid the conflict to come . We must have courage , and open our hearts to the signs and visions that will guide us . Thus have the ancestors spoken , thus have I spoken to you ... " Balam Xoc turned and stepped down off the pedestal , leaving the tall yellow stone to stand in his place . The crowd knelt or lay where they had fallen , slow to come to life , like the survivors of a battle or a devastating storm . Yes , a storm , Zac Kuk thought , like the storm that found Akbal and me in Ektun , and helped to bring me to Tikal , to be here on this day . Akbal had tried to warn her , but there were no words to describe what she had just experienced , at least not any she would have believed . She looked over at Kanan Naab and Ixchel , who had lowered Box Ek into a sitting position and were standing over her solicitously , shading her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of pride , that the three of them were the only people in the plaza still on their feet . She held out her hands to Kanan Naab , who grasped them lightly in her own , smiling in recognition of their common strength . " I would have been lost without you , " Zac Kuk confessed , and Ixchel nodded in agreement , her face streaked with tears . Kanan Naab looked at each of them in turn , neither accepting nor denying their gratitude . " You will not be lost again , " she promised them , then glanced around at the other women of the clan , as if hearing their moans and the sounds of their weeping for the first time . " Come , " she said abruptly . " We are the strong ones now . We must restore those who were not prepared for the touch of the Jaguar Protector . "  | " Yes , " Zac Kuk murmured obediently , feeling that she was one of those herself , and not one of the strong ones . Yet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her doubts and fears did not matter , as long as she could overcome them sufficiently to act . Perhaps that , in the end , was what it meant to be Jaguar Paw.  | THE FEVERED world of Kinich 's dreams was green and wet , utterly sunless . Every way he turned , a wall of green closed in upon him , clutching at his limbs until he was held fast . He saw his men moving away from him , already partly obscured by the green , and he tried to call out to them to stay . Gaunt faces , swollen and scarred by thorns and insect bites , looked back at him , but their eyes were glazed and unseeing . I must count them , Kinich thought desperately ; I must count the ones who are still with me . But they were gone , and all he could see were the faces of the lost , rearing up to accuse him , to remind him of the warrior 's death he had promised . Faces pale and bloated from drowning , contorted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever . One hung slack in the air , tongue protruding , a vine looped tight around his neck ; another sunk in a swirl of bloody water , his eyes rolling back in horror . Kinich could not bear to live these deaths again , but he could not shut them out . The faces reappeared over and over again , cursing him and leering at his helplessness , driving him to a despair that made him begin to sink , surrendering to the relentless suction of the swamp below . . . serpents writhed among the tangle of vines above him , black-banded boas that twined themselves around the light and squeezed it out . The faces vanished , and the air in front of him grew dense and viscous , filled with greenish spores that sprouted and blossomed until the air , too , had been consumed . He felt his head being wrapped and compressed , the gnarled fingers of roots penetrating his skull to crush out his mind .. . Then breath returned , and his eyes popped open , struck immediately by a  | bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throbbing brain . The fever was like an undulating flame beneath his skin , which was slippery with sweat and felt raw to the touch . His vision blurred with the pain and then returned , and he found that he was sitting up , his back against a tree . The blue light seemed to filter down slowly through the vine-draped canopy overhead , illuminating the feathery tips of the tall ferns and bringing a slick shine to the dew-soaked leaves of the undergrowth . His men lay sleeping in clumps in the clearing they had cut for themselves , the mist hanging just above them in curling shrouds , resembling smoke in the eerie light . Kinich stared for a long time before he could clearly distinguish the shapes of the men , and then he saw the creatures that hovered or crawled over the prostrate bodies , fluttering their wings like giant insects , feeding on the sleeping men .. . A feeling of enormous loathing turned over in his stomach , giving him the will to move . He had to protect his men from these vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down at himself , his chest and legs dappled with blue light . And there , poised on his thigh , was a quivering black blotch , feeding on him . Rage threw his arm into motion , but so slowly that he seemed to watch it swing forward for several long moments before his hand closed over the creature and crushed down upon it with all his strength . There was a muffled squeak , and something sharp bit into his palm , so that he grunted and threw the creature down and away from his body , nauseated by the warm stickiness that clung to his hand . The fever pounded in his ears as he struggled to his feet , clutching blindly at the tree for support . His legs felt limp and disjointed , buckling spasmodically as successive waves of dizziness passed over him . He lost track of where he was for a while and simply stood shaking , chafing his hands on the rough bark of the tree . Finally he could stand alone , and turned in a slow circle back toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The creatures rose off the bodies at his approach , swooping and fluttering around him as he angrily waved his arms , trying to swat them out of the air . Then they spiraled upward and were gone . Kinich let his arms drop , exhausted by the effort , which had intensified the painful pressure in his head . The men lay sleeping all around him , undisturbed by the commotion he had created , as they had been unaware of the creatures taking their blood . Kinich did not know how he had avoided stepping on them , and did not find it easy to avoid a second time as he turned to make his way back to the tree . His spear was propped up against a nearby bush , and he took it into his hands , reassured by its unbending weight , which seemed too great to lift . He leaned upon it like a staff and stared into the blackness of the jungle , into the thickly shadowed darkness where the bluish light of the moon could not penetrate . Then he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow , ominous in their intensity . A jaguar , Kinich thought helplessly , tasting fear upon his lips . He gripped the spear in both hands and pointed it at the eyes , feeling a fresh surge of fear at the sheer feebleness of the gesture . He was easy prey in his present condition , no match for a hungry animal . But he would fight ; he would die before he let himself be eaten . Yet the eyes came no closer . Instead they seemed to rise , as if the jaguar were being lifted from below , or had reared up upon its hind legs . The eyes rose until they stared directly into his own , holding his gaze for a moment that seemed  | to stretch on forever . Kinich heard his own heart beating and felt the strength drain from his arms , so that the spear slipped from his hands and fell to the ground with a thud . The eyes blinked once and then vanished into the air , snapping the tension between them so abruptly that Kinich was jerked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeds . He struggled briefly to rise , but the last of his strength was gone , and the fever soon took him into unconsciousness . HE WOKE to the sound of dripping water , and the ticklish explorations of ants on his back . He lay curled up on his side , and the ground within his range of vision was spotted with the grey light of dawn . He blinked several times , noting that his eyes no longer felt so swollen and grainy , so ready to pop out of his head . Warily , he tested his muscles , and though weak , they moved as he wished ; they were his own again . The fever had broken . Pushing himself into a sitting position , he brushed the ants off his back , experiencing a profound sense of relief when the motions failed to make him dizzy . He had almost grown accustomed to feeling dizzy and out of control , his mind a blur and his responses deadened by fever . Now he could lead his men again , and not simply slog along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trail . Now , perhaps , he could lead them out of this jungle , before any more were lost . His spear lay on the ground beside him ; the men still slept in the clearing , exactly as he remembered seeing them in the night . But had he actually seen them ? Kinich shook himself irritably , uncertain that he had been awake , and not dreaming . The strange light , the giant insects , the jaguar that had watched him but had not attacked . There were no insects so large , even in this miserable jungle , and no jaguars who stood to look into the eyes of a man . Those had to be the products of his delirium , as well as the notion that he could have risen and staggered around the clearing as he remembered , without rousing any of the men . He must have dreamed it all . Yet . . . lifting his hands from his lap , Kinich turned them over and examined his palms . They had been scarred by thorns and blistered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ax to cut his way through the jungle . But in the fleshy part of his right palm he found two recent punctures which seemed bruised as well as bloody , testifying to the depth of the bite . Yes , I killed one of them , he thought , and immediately got to his knees and began to search the ground around him . He found what he was looking for curled up against the bole of a protruding root : a furry brown body with sticklike black wings folded up around a triangular head , the familiar leafshaped nose jutting up between pointed ears . Bats , Kinich thought ; underworld creatures , who lived beneath the earth and drank the blood of the living . Revolted , he rose to his feet , refusing to touch it , unconsciously shaking the hand it had bitten . He knew now that he had not been dreaming , and he picked up his spear before turning to face the spot where he had seen the eyes . He walked slowly toward it , examining the ground as he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded him constantly , but he had learned to do his share to keep himself alive . And he knew the put ; marks of a . iaauar when he saw them . for this would not be the  | first one to have shadowed their camp in the night . Yet there were no tracks in the mud , no bits of fur caught on the thorns , no signs of vegetation crushed by the passing of so large a beast . There had been no jaguar here . Kinich stood on the spot and gazed back at the motionless forms of his men . There were only twelve of them left , half the number he had led into this trackless wilderness so many days before . Of the dead , only two had fallen to the Macaws . Two more had deserted in the night , and one had hanged himself ; the rest had died in ways more horrible than anything Kinich had ever seen on a battlefield . The living had discarded everything but their weapons and their trust in him , following him through endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the days when the rains came so heavily that the sun could not be seen at all . They obeyed him like warriors , even though they scarcely resembled men anymore , so disfigured were their faces and bodies by sickness and hunger . I must save them , Kinich vowed , watching over them from the place where he himself had been watched . He remembered the eyes rising to meet his own , holding him fast , and he realized  --  accepted  --  that it had been no ordinary jaguar . It was no dream but a sign , a vision , reminding him that even here , in this hostile land , he moved in the sight of his ancestors . The forest around him had begun to come alive with bird sounds , and he could see the sky clearing through the trees overhead . He had to rouse the men and tell them what he had seen , and encourage them to resume the march . As he rehearsed the words he would use , an iguana suddenly ambled out of the undergrowth and stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . It was greyish green with black bars on its side , fully four feet long to the end of its banded tail . The spear was still in Kinich 's hands , and he thrust without a second thought , feeling the long tail whip his legs as the lizard died with an angry hiss . Another sign , he told himself joyfully , licking his cracked lips at the thought of the iguana 's tender white flesh . But his hunger did not overwhelm him completely , and he paused over the carcass , honoring the spirit he had just taken . Then he made a silent prayer of gratitude and dipped his fingers into the blood , flicking it toward the sky , the Place of the Ancestors . Tikal FILLING HER gourd with water from the bucket under the trees , Zac Kuk went back out into the hot sunlight , adjusting the palm-leaf hat that covered her head . She climbed up onto the bank of the reservoir , stopping beside one of the huge dredge piles that lined the bank at regular intervals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell in the heat , and it gave off a powerful aroma of rotting snails and algae , attracting clouds of midges and blue-winged flies . Zac Kuk sucked air through her mouth and looked down into the reservoir , marveling at how much had been accomplished in a single month . Emptied of its remaining water , the sloping floor of the oval basin had been dredged and scraped down to its paving stones , which had baked to a dull yellow in the sun . At the very bottom , a reddish-grey circle showed where the  | stones had been pried up , exposing the bare clay underneath . Men with hoes and rakes were spreading a fresh layer of gravel over the circle of clay , their faces covered with rags against the dust that rose around them . One month , Zac Kuk thought incredulously , waving absently at the flies that had strayed to her from the dredge pile . It had seemed an impossible task on the day that Balam Xoc had first brought them here . Only a few of them were actually workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never bent their backs to this kind of labor before , not even in imagination . Yet they were the ones , Balam Xoc had told them sternly , who would see that the reservoir was cleaned and fully repaired before the arrival of the rains . They could no longer depend upon others to do the things that kept them alive , he had warned ; this was not the work of lords , but it had more dignity than a slow and helpless death by starvation . And so we have done it , Zac Kuk reflected , fearing Balam Xoc perhaps even more than starvation . Remembering the gourd in her hand , she turned away from the scene below and started walking along the bank . She moved without haste , at a pace learned through long days spent in this heat . She and the others would be here again at sunrise tomorrow , and every sunrise thereafter , until the work was done . The reservoir was their life , the single event to which all others were subordinated , so that the hours away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zac Kuk had never even seen a reservoir before coming to Tikal , and would not have thought twice about its construction . Now , though , it was the only thing that she and Akbal talked about , on those rare occasions when they had the energy to talk . Most nights they simply slept and tried to gather strength for the next day , lacking even the capacity to wonder at themselves . She found Akbal standing among a group of men and women who were scooping crushed stone into reed carrying baskets . He was wearing the leather band of a tumpline around his forehead , and his face and body were covered with a sweat-streaked coat of grey dust . He smiled in greeting , though , and took the gourd from her gratefully . The other workers also murmured appreciatively , taking a moment out from their work to pass the water around . Akbal tipped Zac Kuk 's conical hat onto the back of her head so that he could see her face , clicking his tongue at the swollen lump of a fly bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot and shrugged ruefully . " They always find you when your hands are filled , " she said without complaint , and Akbal bared his teeth in a grimace of recognition . His back and legs were dotted with similar bites , and she could smell the sour odor of his unwashed body , as he no doubt could smell hers . But vanity had been sacrificed long ago , along with the comforts of the flesh , and the luxury of complaining about either . Only fortitude mattered , and they were both proud that neither had missed a day of work due to injury or fatigue , or been overcome by the heat . This was their penance , their absolution for having drawn the wrath of the Jaguar Protector . The workers behind Akbal suddenly fell silent and came stiffly to attention , and Zac Kuk turned to see Balam Xoc coming toward them . He was accompanied by his usual retainers , the Close Ones , as the other clanspeople called them . They acted as a kind of human screen between Balam Xoc and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convening the  | questions of those afraid to approach Balam Xoc directly . There were only four with him today : Hok and Kanan Naab , a squat old woman named Chibil , who was a healer , and a former priest from Copan by the name of Opna . Zac Kuk bowed with the others when Balam Xoc and his retainers stopped on the other side of the gravel pile . Balam Xoc studied them without speaking , his gaze intense but restless , moving from face to face and over the spaces around and between them . He did not squint in the glare of the sun , and his dark , reddish-brown skin , as always , was dry and unmarked by insect bites . Even at a distance , Zac Kuk could feel his inner urgency , like a thickening of the air around her . He had indeed been transformed by his last confinement , his detachment having become the forbidding vacancy of one who listens only to himself . His attention to those around him most often took the form of impatience or anger now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged proximity . Scooping up a handful of gravel , Balam Xoc opened his palm and let the pebbles trickle back onto the pile , watching their fall with the intentness of a diviner scattering maize . Then he glanced once more at the workers and turned away without a word , the Close Ones drawing in around him . But they had only gone a few steps when they stopped and waited for the messenger approaching along the bank , a young man wearing the blue net cape of a palace functionary . " I have a message from Lord Pacal Balam , the chief steward of crops , " the young man told Opna , who confronted him in Balam Xoc 's place . " I was told to deliver it personally to Balam Xoc . " " Speak , " Balam Xoc commanded , waving Opna out of the way . The messenger bowed but then hesitated , glancing at all the people who were listening . Balam Xoc made a brusque , beckoning gesture , indicating that he required no more privacy than this . " Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then paused and swallowed gravely . " The warriors of Ain Caan and Shield Jaguar were ambushed by the Macaws and have suffered a terrible defeat . Tikal has lost over thirty of her men , including three from the Jaguar Paw Clan . One of these was the Nacom Kinich Kakmoo . " The messenger stopped out of respect , expecting an outpouring of sorrow and grief . But the man in front of him was expressionless , apparently unmoved by the revelation . The people around him began dropping to their knees , bowing to him with reverence and awe . The messenger stared at this display in disbelief , until Balam Xoc again gestured for him to go on . " A lengthy search was conducted for survivors , but none were found , " the young man continued , casting sidelong glances at the kneeling people . " It must be assumed that all were killed or captured by the Macaws . Ain Caan and the other warriors are recovering in Yaxchilan ; a period of mourning will be officially declared upon their return . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messenger had concluded , and the young man nodded uncertainly . " Is there a message you would have me take to Lord Pacal ? " " He had my message long ago , " Balam Xoc said curtly . " As I had yours . Go . " Ignoring the young man 's parting bow , he turned to his retainers , gesturing  | " Inform the people of this , " he commanded . " Remind them that the rains will also come early , as I have said . We must work even harder , and see that our task is finished in time . " Keeping only Hok with him , Balam Xoc continued on down the bank . The workers slowly began to rise , exchanging nervous glances when they saw that Akbal had remained standing . He seemed too numb to move , his eyes glazed with shock and the incomprehension of his loss . Zac Kuk came to his side , but he did not see her . She was about to suggest that he sit for a moment in the shade when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to follow . " Come , my sister . We must tell May about her husband . " The briskness of Kanan Naab 's tone brought Akbal out of his trance in an instant , as if he had been slapped . He blinked and lifted a hand to shield his eyes from the sun . " Kinich is gone , " he said in a thick voice . " Our brother has died . " " Yes , " Kanan Naab agreed succinctly , betraying no more emotion than her grandfather had shown earlier . Akbal 's face tightened , and he leaned toward her belligerently , as if to force some greater response from her . The workers stared at him with a kind of horror , amazed that he would challenge one of the Close Ones , even if she were his own sister . " Will we not observe a period of mourning of our own ? " Zac Kuk interjected , hoping to loosen the awful tension that had sprung up between the two of them . Kanan Naab shook her head impatiently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourn when Grandfather decides it is appropriate . " " Or not at all , " Akbal suggested bitterly , in a voice that seemed much too loud . " Could you not have foreseen this ? " Kanan Naab demanded . " Our brother was a warrior , and he chose to serve the ruler instead of the clan . " " Do we abandon him , then ? " Akbal demanded in return . " Do we allow his spirit to wander alone in the Underworld , without our prayers to sustain and guide him ? " Kanan Naab tossed her head in exasperation . " We will do as Grandfather commands , " she repeated coldly . " You bring no honor to yourself , or our brother , by indulging in your grief now . Come , Zac Kuk ... " Zac Kuk hesitated out of loyalty , gazing up at Akbal from beneath the ragged fringe of her hat . His teeth were clenched , and he was breathing hard through his nose , as if in the grips of some incoherent fury . But gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face , and realized that all the other workers were staring at him . His shoulders slumped , and he sighed in resignation . " Give May what comfort you can , my wife , " he said quietly , narrowing his eyes at Kanan Naab 's retreating back . " Tell her that she is not alone in her grief . However it may seem ... " IN THE I.AS'r DAYS before the rains came , Balam Xoc became ferocious in his urgency , as if he could smell the storm approaching . He went from one work crew to the next , goading them to greater exertions with his presence , and often  | laid back down over a freshly graveled bottom , fitted together with painstaking care , so that they would not buckle or separate . Then another layer of gravel was spread evenly over the stone floor , as damp , salty winds began to blow in from the east . It was still the first days of the month of Pax , too early for the rains to begin in earnest , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too late . The final stage of the project involved leveling and shaping the bank , and shoring it up with loose stones . Clouds had been coming in for the last day and a half , sparing the workers the sun 's direct heat as they labored on the bank and the drainage ditches that cut through it at several points . Then the sky darkened , and thunder broke over Tikal , and they could hear the rattling approach of the rain as it pelted distant trees . Many of the workers flung themselves into a last , frantic burst of activity , but others simply stopped where they were and stood looking up at the sky . When Balam Xoc stopped and turned to face the east , everybody ceased their labors and put down their tools . They also realized for the first time that they were done . The work that remained was not of crucial importance , and they would lose no water because of it . They had finished in time . Bending the trees before it , the rain swept over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reservoir , drenching them where they stood . They turned their faces up to it , letting it blind their eyes and fill their open mouths . Men and women alike removed their hats and headwraps and let the water cascade over their loosened hair , washing away the mud and dust and sweat of the many long days . Even after the initial downpour , the rain continued to fall steadily , and the sky remained dark to the east , indicating that this was not to be an isolated shower . The rains had indeed come early , and with convincing force . His white hair gleaming in the murky , liquid light , Balam Xoc walked down alone into the reservoir , leaving dark footprints in the gravel . The water was already calf-deep at the bottom , and he waded into the middle of the pool and turned to face the people on the bank above . His lips moving to some unheard chant or prayer , he dipped his cupped hands into the water at his feet and offered it to the sky in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drank , and the people on the bank began to shout and sing with joy . Standing next to a gushing drainage ditch , Zac Kuk saw Akbal coming toward her , searching for her as he wove his way through the celebrating crowd . She glanced down at herself briefly , smiling at the memories her clinging shift evoked . She turned the smile on Akbal when he saw her , feeling warmth well up under her skin at the way his eyes fastened upon her . He had not forgotten the storm in Ektun , either , and he dodged through the crowd with reckless eagerness , crossing the ditch with an unhesitating leap . Clasping wet hands , they laughed at themselves , knowing perfectly what was in the other 's mind . " Come , " Akbal said , and began to turn away from the reservoir , leading her by the hand . Zac Kuk pulled back halfheartedly . " Perhaps we should wait for Balam Xoc to release us . " Akbal shook his head firmly , displaying a flash of the defiance he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it . Besides , we have earned our release , at least for  | Feeling little urge to disagree , Zac Kuk allowed herself to be persuaded , and to be led away through the crowd , toward the path that led to their house . THE EARLY arrival of the rains took the rest of the city by surprise , and delayed the burning of the fallowed maize fields past the day designated by the ruler and his priests . But then the rains slackened and assumed a more normal pattern , with substantial periods of sunlight and clear sky between the heaviest downpours . The lingering wetness made the burning of some of the lowland fields only partially successful , but the depth of water in the alkalches gave promise that the raised fields there would produce abundantly . The planting of the maize , cotton , and other crops was finally completed early in the month of Kayab , only slightly behind the schedule established by the chief steward of crops . The rains also delayed the return of Ain Caan and his warriors from Yaxchilan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been lost was not declared until after the planting had been finished . The mourning was to last for nine days , one for each of the nine levels of the Underworld . A muffled drum beat in the Plaza of the Ancestors , where Caan Ac himself , his body smeared with ashes , presided over the rites of the dead . A ceremonial ball game was also played on the court next to the plaza , and the city 's marketplace was allowed to open for only a few hours each day , with all business conducted in a properly subdued tone . The Jaguar Paw Clan , however , had not even sent a representative to greet the returning warriors , and Balam Xoc had begun to implement the second phase of work at the reservoir as soon as the rains had become more moderate . Calling together the heads of the work crews and his Close Ones , he had described to them the way he had seen the reservoir in its final form : its waters deep and clean , mirroring the well-tended gardens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with the thatched huts of those who would work the land and water the crops . Further , he had specified which trees would be saved and which cut , and how the mud from the reservoir was to be spread over the cleared areas , and then the dried brush laid over that , to provide ground cover until the time was right for burning . He had even elaborated upon the variety of crops that would be grown , naming those that could be planted in the shade of the remaining trees and those that would require full sunlight . Though clearly no farmer , he had spoken with the familiarity of one who had already witnessed every step of the work and had walked through the gardens in their finished state . The original work crews had been formed voluntarily , largely on the basis of family ties and personal friendships . But Balam Xoc now reorganized them totally , distributing the experienced workmen among them evenly and concentrating some of those with special skills . One crew , under the command of Tzec Balam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the houses of the high priest 's family . Another was put to work cutting poles and thatch for the houses that Balam Xoc 's followers would occupy for the duration of the project , or until such time as they were formally adopted into the clan . A third crew was composed entirely of women who were to spend their time sharpening tools and fashioning water buckets out of vines and cedar slats .  | forest surrounding the reservoir , and were told to begin the arduous task of clearing the land with stone axes and flint knives . Akbal had been put in charge of one of these crews , and it was to him that Kanan Naab came with the message from Balam Xoc , requesting the loan of a particularly skilled woodcutter . She found him standing beneath a chicle tree that had a white chalk mark on its trunk , the only tree still standing in the immediate area . Akbal was studying a map he had drawn , showing the locations of the other trees and plants that were to be saved , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After hearing her message , he went back to his map for a few more moments , and then glanced out over the men working among the trees . " I can probably spare him , " he said finally , giving her a judicious nod . " I will send him as soon as he is finished with the tree he is cutting . We can occupy ourselves with the undergrowth until he returns . " " Grandfather will be pleased that you find the arrangement acceptable , " Kanan Naab said sarcastically , annoyed at the way he always made her wait . He did the same to all the Close Ones , though his lack of deference seemed especially pointed in her case . " It is past noon , " he said , glancing briefly at the sky . " The official period of mourning is over , for those who observed it . " He raised his eyebrows slightly , veiling his eyes in a kind of sardonic wink , as if he could predict her response all too easily . Kanan Naab allowed her anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow breath before replying . " I am quite aware of the time that has passed , " she said stiffly . " And so is Grandfather . I have spoken to him of this several times , but I can not make him listen when he does not wish to . " Akbal grunted scornfully . " No doubt you whispered loudly , my sister . No doubt you used your influence to its fullest extent . " " Why do you bait me , Akbal ? " Kanan Naab demanded furiously , losing her restraint . " Why do you pretend that I have more influence than you or anyone else ? If you truly believed that , you would show me more respect than you do . " " What am Ito believe , then ? That you only serve , and have no thoughts or feelings of your own ? Is that cause for respect ? " Tears of resentment sprang up in Kanan Naab 's eyes , and she clenched her fists tightly . " I did not choose the role I have been given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the admiration of your workers by treating the Close Ones with disdain , but it is still a false display of independence . You also do whatever Grandfather demands , despite your scorn for his servants . " " That is my choice , " Akbal insisted forcefully . " The choice he gave me , and you as well . Or have you forgotten ? " " He is not the same man who spoke to us at the stone . I doubt that he would remember . He watches for signs now , and expects to be obeyed without argument or hesitation . Have you forgotten the anger of the Jaguar Protec-tor ? " Akbal rolled up his map with a deft , snapping motion of his wrists , his lips pursed stubbornly . " I will never forget that , " he said shortly . " But we have all paid for our dereliction . I will not found my sense of duty on fear . "  | He turned away and started to walk toward his men , slapping the map against his thigh . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the path through the breadnut trees , and she called Akbal back , gesturing urgently in their direction . There were perhaps twenty of them , including Nohoch Ich and several other members of the clan council , and they were trailed by an equal number of young boys . Most of the men wore headwraps and palace clothing , and they walked in silence , their expressions deeply somber . " I will go for Grandfather , " Kanan Naab said to Akbal when he had returned to the tree , and she left him there and went down the bank with rapid steps . By the time Nohoch and the others reached the place where he stood , Akbal had begun to realize what must have happened , and gave his uncle a look of solemn inquiry . " The ruler has taken his revenge , " Nohoch said in a tight voice . " I have been expelled from the Order of the Tun Count Priests , and our clansmen have all been discharged from their posts within the city 's administration . Everyone except your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Akbal 's side , his downcast eyes showing that he had lost his apprenticeship , as well . Akbal put a comforting hand on his shoulder , noticing that the members of his crew had left their cutting and were standing in a crowd behind him . He made no attempt to send them back to their work , though , and turned with them to bow when Balam Xoc came into the clearing with Kanan Naab and his other retainers . " Caan Ac has decided to blame his misfortune upon you and your prophecy , Grandfather , " Nohoch explained , and repeated what he had told Akbal . Balam Xoc squinted at him thoughtfully , betraying no surprise . " What else has he done ? " " He has told the traveling merchants of the Sky Clan not to carry our goods any longer , " Nohoch went on , " and he has threatened to punish anyone who trades with us within the city . His warriors are stationed at the head of the trails leading to our houses , to observe and intimidate those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the clearing was complete , broken only by the buzzing of insects and the muted crash of a tree falling in the next work area . " So it has begun , " Balam Xoc said at last . He turned and gestured brusquely to Hok , who flinched in confusion before seeing that Balam Xoc was pointing to his waist . Then he produced a short , bone-handled knife , encased in a leather sheath , which he had been carrying in his waistband . " Here , " Balam Xoc continued , holding out the knife to Nohoch . " You must carry this with you now . " Nohoch appeared startled for a moment , then straightened his shoulders and put out his hand , nodding to show that he understood . He tucked the knife under the waistband of his loincloth , next to his hip , the way a weapon was worn . The onlookers shifted uneasily , uncertain of the full significance of the gift , but aware that priests were not allowed to carry weapons and that Nohoch had never needed one before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more ominous meaning , though typically , Balam Xoc did not offer any further explanations . " The ruler 's revenge will be our good fortune , " he announced . " There are  | posts for all of you here , and work that will directly benefit our people . Nohoch , you may take charge of the work crew here . " Balam Xoc paused , his eyes flickering over the crowd until he found Akbal . " Acquaint your uncle with what you have accomplished so far , Akbal . Then you may return to the craft house . " Akbal simply stared back at him , too surprised to bow or otherwise indicate his compliance . But Balam Xoc had already turned away and was making other assignments , gesturing broadly in the direction of the other work areas . Nohoch came over , and Akbal numbly handed him the map he had been holding . He had only begun to explain how the trees were being cut , though , when he was seized by an idea that brought animation back into his face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant , Uncle , " he suggested impulsively . " Then I would have the time to explain everything thoroughly . " Nohoch narrowed his eyes doubtfully . " Balam Xoc has ordered you back to the craft house , has he not ? You must go . " But what can be accomplished there ? " Akbal asked , spreading his hands wide in appeal . " My work has no value if it can not be traded . " The crowd around them had dispersed rapidly , the crew going back to their labors and the new men being led off by some of the Close Ones . Suddenly Balam Xoc intruded himself into the conversation , glancing sharply from one to the other . " What is your difficulty ? " he demanded , fixing his gaze on Akbal when the younger man dropped his eyes . But then Nohoch intervened politely , coming to his nephew 's defense . " Akbal feels that he could be of more use to the clan if he served as my assistant . I would be pleased to have him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , Grandfather , " Akbal put in bravely , forcing himself to meet Balam Xoc 's eyes , " our craft goods will be worthless . I would also like to do work that is beneficial to our people . " Balam Xoc cocked his head and looked Akbal up and down , as if studying his stance for clues to this sudden show of defiance . Behind him , Kanan Naab shook her head sadly and looked away , as if it pained her to watch what was coming . But Balam Xoc 's voice was surprisingly tolerant , almost explanatory , when he finally spoke . " There are still your friends in Yaxchilan and Ektun , " he reminded Akbal . " They will still trade with us , if we honor our agreements . See that the work is done , Akbal , even if you must do all of it yourself . I will find a way to convey the goods when the time comes . " Relieved as much as mollified , Akbal bowed from the waist , crossing his arms over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he found this elaborate display of compliance as puzzling as Akbal 's earlier recalcitrance . Then he shrugged and gestured toward Kal Cuc , who had remained at Akbal 's side . " Do you wish to have the boy with you ? " Akbal looked down at Kal Cuc , and his face brightened , as if he had just been offered a reward . " Of course . He is my assistant . "  | " Use him well , then , " Balam Xoc said dismissively , and turned away , taking Kanan Naab with him . Akbal looked at Nohoch and let out a long breath . " Surely , your duties must be clear to you now , " Nohoch suggested drily . " Go attend to them , my son . I can find my own way here . " " I never doubted that you could , " Akbal confessed with a small smile , beckoning to Kal Cuc to follow . " Come , there is important work for us at the craft house . Our work ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ek said to Zac Kuk , as the two of them came out of Kinich Kakmoo 's house . " This has gone on too long . " " But he is at the reservoir , " Zac Kuk protested mildly , lifting her palm-leaf umbrella to shade the old woman from the sun . " And it is very hot today , Grandmother . " " That is what May says , to excuse herself , " Box Ek replied curtly . " But we all suffer from much more than the heat . Come . " Leaning heavily on her stick , she hobbled out onto the plaza , displaying a vitality she had not possessed in many months . Zac Kuk had seen very little of her , in fact , since the work had begun on the reservoir , and was surprised when she had suddenly appeared in May 's chamber , where Zac Kuk had been trying to comfort her grieving sister-in-law . It had reminded her of the way Box Ek had come in when she was being dressed for her wedding night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman than her mother had been that night . As they walked slowly past the craft house , they saw Akbal through the open doorway , mixing paints with Kal Cuc . Both were too absorbed in their work to see the women , and did not look up as they passed . " Why did Akbal and Kanan Naab not see to this ? " Box Ek inquired , straining her neck to give Zac Kuk a stiff , sidelong glance . " Kanan Naab has tried to bring it to Balam Xoc 's attention , " Zac Kuk explained , " but she says he will not listen . She and Akbal argued about it , and have not been on friendly terms ever since . " Box Ek made an exasperated noise , shaking her head as if it hurt her . " And how long has it been since you have seen your brother ? " " Chan Mac ? " Zac Kuk said in surprise . Then she frowned as she thought back . " Not since before the Tun-End Ceremony , Grandmother . When Balam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ektun ambassador told my brother that he should not visit us for a while . Now , of course , it has become impossible for anyone to visit us . " " Of course , " Box Ek repeated gruffly , holding up a hand to indicate that she had to rest . They had reached the shade of the breadnut trees , though even here , the sullen heat of the afternoon seemed to hang in the air around them , like some invisible , enervating presence . The rains had stopped a few days earlier , giving way to the period of hot , dry weather that always followed the onset of the rainy season . Everywhere else in the city the people were praying that the drought would not be prolonged , and that the rains would return in time to save the new crops . The Jaguar Paw Clan , however , labored on in their isolation , guided by Balam Xoc 's prediction that there would indeed be a  | drought , and by his insistence that the clan 's gardens must be ready by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the rains will return ? " Box Ek asked as they began moving again . Zac Kuk shook her head uncertainly . " I am told that he watches for signs of this . He and all of the Close Ones . " " The uos sang to me in my dreams last night , " Box Ek told her suddenly . " But the water that brought them out of the earth was not rain , but the tears of the people . " Zac Kuk caught her breath . " Perhaps it was a sign , Grandmother . " " Perhaps , " Box Ek allowed . " But May is a much more visible sign , and she has been overlooked . For too long . Ah , we are here . Find him for me , my daughter . I can not walk much farther . " Scanning the nearest clearing , Zac Kuk quickly spotted the cluster of people that Balam Xoc always drew , people without tools or baskets or buckets . They were standing in front of the first of the workers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet received its coating of mud and lime plaster . Picking a path between the stacks of firewood and piles of drying brush , Zac Kuk led Box Ek toward the house , shading her with the umbrella . Before they could reach the group around Balam Xoc , though , they were intercepted by Kanan Naab . " Forgive me , Grandmother , " she apologized to Box Ek . " But this is not a good time to disturb him . He has been withdrawn from us all day . " She glanced back over her shoulder , inviting them to see for themselves . Balam Xoc stood motionless in the midst of his retainers , who attended him with a kind of tense expectancy , squatting or standing around him in silence . Balam Xoc 's eyes were fixed upon the cloudless sky , apparently following the movements of the vultures that circled high over the reservoir . " Perhaps I can help you , " Kanan Naab suggested in a hushed voice , inclining her cloth-wrapped head to the old woman . " As you helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect , not help . I will speak to my brother . " Kanan Naab 's head jerked back at the reprimand , her face darkening beneath the light-colored headwrap . She cast a questioning glance at Zac Kuk , perhaps sensing a conspiracy , though her expression seemed more harried than suspicious . She tried again to reason with Box Ek . " I am not heartless , Grandmother . I have raised the subject of mourning many times , but he has never responded . " " Did his silence forbid you to act yourself ? " Box Ek demanded , waving her aside with her stick . " You are in my way , Kanan Naab . We have hidden from our grief long enough . " " Who is that ? " a voice called , and Kanan Naab stepped back so that they could see Balam Xoc beckoning to them . " Let them come forward . " Nohoch and Opna were standing on either side of Balam Xoc , and Hok was squatting stolidly at his feet . But when his sister had approached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squatted , so that she would not have to strain to look up at him . The other two men did likewise , as did Zac Kuk , setting the umbrella down beside her . Contrary to what Kanan Naab had predicted , Balam Xoc 's attention was intense and focused completely upon Box Ek.  | " You spoke of grief , my sister , " he prompted , and Box Ek nodded , planting her stick firmly in the mud and leaning upon it with both hands . " I have just come from the wife of Kinich Kakmoo . She languishes from grief , and from the neglect of her grief . It is wrong that she has not been allowed to mourn for her husband . " Both Nohoch and Opna frowned at the bluntness of her scolding , and Hok 's one good eye glared up at her out of a tangle of black hair . Balam Xoc , though , simply gestured for her to go on , as if certain that she had her own resolution in mind . " I have come to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if perhaps you have seen this . We can not mourn him properly if we do not know which rites to perform . " Zac Kuk saw Opna shake his head wearily , as if Box Ek were not the first to seek the fate of a loved one in Balam Xoc 's visions . Nohoch was frowning even more deeply , obviously perturbed by the old woman 's willingness to take the rites into her own hands , with or without the permission of the Living Ancestor . Balam Xoc briefly glanced upward at the sky , rubbing his chin thoughtfully . " It would indeed have been wrong not to mourn Kinich Kakmoo , " he conceded , slowly lowering his eyes to his sister 's face . " If he were dead . But he was not killed or captured by the Macaws . That much I have seen . " Astonishment blossomed on all of the faces surrounding him , though it was very quickly assimilated into a kind of reverent pride , a sharing of the master 's power . Opna and Nohoch exchanged a glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly appreciate the value of this revelation . " You knew this , and you did not tell May ? " Box Ek burst out angrily . " Why have you allowed her to suffer so needlessly ? " Balam Xoc considered her silently , unmoved by the accusation . Hok , though , appeared about to spring , and Balam Xoc , as if sensing this , waved him back down with a small movement of his hand . " Because I do not know if Kinich will return , " he replied calmly . " Perhaps your coming here , though , is a sign that he will . I was thinking of death when you appeared . " Box Ek stared back at him speechlessly , her energy expended along with her anger . " What else disturbs you , my sister ? " Balam Xoc asked shrewdly . " Was it only concern for May that brought you here today ? " " It was a dream , " Box Ek admitted , " and my own loneliness . I have seen little of my family since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations to one another . In my dream , I heard the uos singing , watered by the tears of our people . When I awoke , I went to May , and understood what I had dreamed . I could not neglect her sorrow as you and these others have . " " Uos , " Balam Xoc repeated softly , and turned his head to look at Zac Kuk . " Is this true , my daughter ? Is there unhappiness among our people ? " Zac Kuk nodded timidly , feeling the attention of the others fasten upon her . " We have little time together when we are not working , or exhausted from work , " she explained . " And we are more scattered now . It is hard to borrow or trade for the things we need , especially with the marketplace closed to us.  | There is no one who wishes to complain , Grandfather , but we are all tired , and we bring little comfort to one another . " " And what about the rest of you ? " Balam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who averted their eyes guiltily . " Why did none of you see this ? " " Why did you not see it yourself , my brother ? " Box Ek inquired sharply . " Are you blind to our suffering ? " The audacity of the question drew a collective , disapproving gasp from the onlookers , who would never have defended themselves in such a way . Though afraid herself that Box Ek had gone too far , Zac Kuk drew closer to her out of loyalty , proud of the old woman 's boldness . " Yes , I am , " Balam Xoc said slowly . " The Spirit Woman has emptied me of feelings and desires , so that I might fill myself with power . Only memory allows me to recognize the signs of sorrow or anger in another , and there are more important things I must remember . " He paused and widened his gaze to include his retainers . " But I have not forbidden anyone else their feelings , and I do not wish that any of you should emulate my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , looking at each of them in turn before returning his attention to the two women in front of him . " I will see that this is communicated to all the people , " he promised . " You must tell the wife of Kinich Kakmoo what I have revealed to you . Tell her to put aside her grief and pray for his safe return . Perhaps he will be back to dance with us at the feast to celebrate our planting . I think now that we will be holding such a feast some time in the month of Uo . " " I will tell her , " Box Ek said , bowing stiffly over her stick . Zac Kuk bowed as well , and Balam Xoc waved a hand over both of them in blessing . " You have done well to come to me . Go , then , and watch over the hearts of my people . Be a sign to them , as you have been to me ... " CRUNCHING CINDERS under his sandaled feet , Pacal walked out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to graze in the night . Bright green grasshoppers whirred up around him as he stopped and squatted among the rows of ankle-high plants . In some places the weeds were nearly as tall , for this was one of the fields that had been too wet to permit a thorough burning . Now it was bone-dry , and the blackened crust of the soil broke into powder when Pacal poked at it with his fingers . The stalks of the young maize plants had begun to droop , and their leaves were yellowing at the edges ; the beans lay in shriveled coils among the weeds , already beyond salvage . The dry spell was now in its fourteenth day , twice its normal length . And despite all the ruler 's prayers and offerings  --  including the sacrifice of two captive Macaws  --  there had been only two brief periods of rain , both of the light and misty kind that only served to make the plants more vulnerable to pests and the sun . Another six days would bring the time of drought to a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of recovery . And if that time came , it would be Pacal who would have to surrender to the inevitable , and pronounce the crops a lost cause . He rose to his feet , feeling the heaviness of despair in his legs and shoulders . The clans had already begun to pressure him to release some of their workers ,  | so that they could try to save their own gardens before it was too late . They had all seen the example of his own clan , and did not hesitate to shame him with it when he tried to deflect their demands . Uaxactun and some of the other cities who had lent their workers to Tikal were threatening to withdraw them entirely unless their promised bonuses were paid in full . The prevailing mood in the palace was one of desperate recrimination , with the ruler himself being the worst of the blame shifters . He had blamed the failure of the campaign on the prophecies of Balam Xoc and the defection of Zotz Mac of Ektun , and he would no doubt try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility for bringing the rains was his and his alone . He will be the last to admit that he has failed in that , Pacal thought , staring bleakly around him . He would have to keep his men working until Caan Ac decided to give up hope , which would probably be days after everyone else . At least we will waste no time trying to save this field , Pacal decided . Not far from where he stood , a column of leaf-cutter ants was methodically stripping a whole row of plants of their foliage , cutting and carrying off the leaves in a moving line . Pacal stepped closer , remembering pranks his brother and he had played as children , rerouting the ants ' path into someone 's house or across a plaza where a ceremony was being held . The memory aroused little amusement in him , though , and he deliberately brought his foot down over the well-beaten trail the ants had marked for themselves , implanting several of them in a shallow pit he dug with the edge of his sandal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confusion , bumping into one another and dropping the leaves they carried like flags in their pincers . Soldier ants immediately rushed to the spot from both ends of the line , and they quickly bullied the others onto a new path around the trench . Soon the column of leaf-laden ants was flowing steadily again , bearing the crops of the ruler off to their nest . Perhaps they deserve them more than we do , Pacal thought morbidly ; indeed , our warriors would lead us straight to the pit , and insist that we plunge in after them . Stepping over the ants , he started walking slowly toward the great ceiba tree that stood at the edge of the field . He had left his scribe there to rest in the shade , and he was surprised now to see that Chac Mut had joined him , along with Ixchel , who was holding little Bolon Oc on her hip . " My wife , " Pacal said in a mildly quizzical tone , as he came in under the tree . " Chac Mut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We met on the trail , " Chac Mut explained , bowing his head slightly to Ixchel . " I came to tell you that Kinich Kakmoo has been reported alive . He and ten other men have found their way to safety in Palenque . " Pacal looked to Ixchel , who gave an eloquent shrug , jiggling the baby in her arms . " Balam Xoc told us this many days ago , " she said . " Though not as long ago as your last visit , my husband . " " I had heard , " Pacal assured her quietly . " I prayed myself for it to be true . When will he return to us ? " " He and the others are not in good health , " Chac Mut reported . " They will spend some time recovering in Palenque . Shield Jaguar has promised to send canoes for them when they are able to travel . " Pacal glanced briefly at the dark-eyed child nodding drowsily against Ixchel 's side , and at the lines of strain and fatigue in his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked Chac Mut , who seemed surprised by the question . " Not to my knowledge . And certainly not intentionally . " " I will tell them myself . You may return to the palace , " Pacal added , gesturing to include the scribe . " There is nothing more to be done here . Leave us some of the water when you go . " Holding out his arms , he relieved his wife of the baby , grunting softly at the child 's unexpected weight . He noticed the way Ixchel 's arms trembled as she released him , and he wondered how she had managed to carry him all this way by herself . " It is a long walk in this heat , " he said , shifting Bolon Oc in his arms . " Let us sit and rest awhile . " They sat with their backs against the tree and drank from the water gourd Chac Mut had left behind . Bolon Oc nursed for a short time and then fell asleep across his mother 's lap . Pacal gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and lowered his voice when he spoke . " I know that I have neglected you , Ixchel . You and our son . I regret this very much , but perhaps you understand how difficult it is for me to identify with the Jaguar Paw Clan at this time . You will eat , ' they say to me ; why do you not give us the same means you gave your father ? ' And the ruler denounces Balam Xoc daily , without regard for my presence . " " I know this , " Ixchel said quickly . " I did not come here to shame you , my husband , but to help you . I thought that it might be useful to you to know when the rains would return , and that knowing this might help to bring you home sooner . " Pacal squinted at her skeptically . " Has my father seen this , as well ? " " The signs of it , yes . The Lady Box Ek had a dream in which the uos sang to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man were digging up a stump , they uncovered a uo , and we all heard it sing : Whoa , whoa , " she said softly , imitating the distinctive croak of the frog . Pacal watched her with an expression of pained tolerance on his long face . " And this revealed the time of the rains ' return ? " " The month of Uo , Grandfather has said , " Ixchel explained with evident pride . " Uo , " Pacal echoed , his mouth forming a bitter 0 around the word . " That is more than a month from now . Even the alkalches would be dry by then . " Ixchel nodded earnestly , missing the note of distress in his voice . " That is when we hope to celebrate our planting . Is it not time enough for you to attempt a second planting as well ? " " Time , certainly , " Pacal said brusquely . " But where would I get the seed and the workers ? And how would I convince the ruler to take such a risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice of Balam Xoc ? I can not even speak my father 's name to him ! " The baby whimpered and stirred in Ixchel 's lap , and she looked down at him hastily , hiding the hurt in her eyes . Pacal sighed in weary apology . " I am sorry , Ixchel . You do not deserve my anger . But surely you must see that what you suggest is impossible . I would be dismissed as a fool if I were to go to the ruler talking of uos and asking for a second planting . "  | " Is Balam Xoc also a fool ? " Ixchel demanded sullenly , refusing to meet his gaze . " He has been correct in everything he has foretold . He has convinced us that the impossible can be done , if it is necessary to the survival of the people . " " And he has convinced the ruler that he is a dangerous man , a threat to the peace and well-being of the city . For all his wisdom , Ixchel , how can he hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosper while their neighbors are starving ? Do you think you will be left in peace if that happens ? I think rather that you will be the target of all the fear and envy and desperation of the other clans , and their hatred will destroy you . " " Are you no longer one of us , then ? " Ixchel asked him in a whisper , her eyes large and moist . Pacal nodded in resignation . " Yes , of course . And I may be back among you very shortly , if the rains hold off as you say . But I see things as a steward must , and I see only tragedy for our city if the clans pursue their own interests at one another 's expense . " Ixchel nodded respectfully , seeming reassured by his explanation , or perhaps merely by the possibility of his imminent return . She certainly did not seem daunted by the tragedy he had described . " Perhaps the other clans will choose to follow our example , " she suggested hopefully , and Pacal could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilience of her optimism . " Then my father will indeed have accomplished the impossible , " he said lightly , and pushed himself to his feet . " Come , let us take our son back to the Jaguar Paw House . " " Then you are not angry with me for coming to you like this ? " Ixchel asked as she handed the sleeping baby up to him . " Angry ? " Pacal repeated incredulously , as if she could not be further from the truth . " No , my wife , I am grateful that you thought to help me . " He swiveled to take in the surrounding fields , his face twisting into a rueful grimace . " Even if I am beyond help ... " IT WAS LATE in the day and the sky had turned cloudy when Nohoch Ich , Balam Xoc , and Cab Coh came out onto the plaza in front of Tzec Balam 's house . Balam Xoc immediately walked to the edge of the plaza and stood looking up at the sky , his hands on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cab Coh stood apart from him , understanding that the patience he had shown during the council meeting had required a conscious effort on his part . " It was a great success , my son , " Cab Coh said , glancing back through the open doorway to where Tzec Balam and some of the other council members were still working out the details of the plans that had been formulated during the meeting . " I le made it easy for all of us , " Nohoch said modestly , nodding toward Balam Xoc . " He let us forget the disagreements of the past . He appealed to our resourcefulness , not our guilt and insecurity . " " He did not interrupt , " Cab Coh allowed . " Still , it was you who suggested we meet here , without any of the Close Ones present . That made an enormous riiff'rnnrw "  | " I am one of the Close Ones , Father , " Nohoch reminded him quietly , but Cab Coh refused to be corrected . " Not like Hok , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the head of the clan council , and we were again the respected elders of our people . Many of us needed to be reminded . " Balam Xoc had started walking toward the path that led back to the reservoir and the Jaguar Paw House , and they followed him at a distance , not wishing to intrude upon his thoughts . Warmed by his father 's praise , Nohoch reflected upon the wide range of issues that had been discussed at the meeting , impressed himself at how many had been resolved . Most had to do with the ruler 's ban on trade and his continuing harassment of the clan , which had produced shortages of necessary goods and had made it difficult for the clan members to communicate with their friends and relatives in other parts of the city . But in sharing their grievances , the men had also discovered the extent to which they could meet one another 's needs . Some had surpluses of what others lacked , and trades were arranged ; ways of conveying messages and getting safely from place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret trade agreements with their closest neighbors were revealed to be much more promising than any of them had thought , once their individual experiences had been combined and evaluated as a whole . The hardships of their isolation , which each had borne as a personal burden , had been seen to yield to the power of cooperation , and to their mutual cleverness . Except perhaps for Balam Xoc , they had all profited from the simple knowledge that their problems were not unique or insoluble , as long as they confronted them as a group . " Akbal will be pleased to know there is paint to be had , " Cab Coh said with satisfaction , breaking into Nohoch 's thoughts . " He has spent too much of his time lately searching for materials . " Nohoch looked around at the forest through which they were passing , noting the dryness of the foliage , which seemed dulled and darkened by a sheen of dust . " Soon the ruler will have to admit that his crops have failed , " Nohoch surmised . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining the things we need . Then even our breadnuts will be valued in trade . " " We must not take advantage of our neighbors , though , " Cab Coh cautioned . " We were agreed upon that . " " We were , " Nohoch acknowledged easily . " We all recognize the need to cultivate new friends and allies . " They realized simultaneously that Balam Xoc had stopped just ahead , and they hesitated for a moment before deciding to overtake him . He was scanning the branches that hung over the trail , his head cocked to one side , as if he were straining to hear a message . " Listen , " he commanded , as they came up on either side of him . " I do not hear the birds . " Nor could they . Only a moment before , it seemed , the forest had been alive with the calls of doves and songbirds , and a wood owl had been hooting with loud regularity . Now it had grown absolutely still , as sometimes happened before a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both looked at It ? 11:1ni Xuw. uihriet ? oi7t. hart Hurt unnn fht. path At Mu fool Hie nnutrile Aaron  | " Death , " he rasped , and suddenly the bushes to their left erupted into violent motion , and a man burst out of the undergrowth and flung himself upon them . Cab Coh let out a guttural scream as the assassin 's knife plunged into his stomach , and he took the man down to the ground with him , wrapped in a convulsive embrace . Knocked sideways by his father 's fall , Nohoch stumbled headlong into one of the men who had jumped out of the bushes on the other side , deflecting the man 's knife-thrust with an elbow to the chest . They grappled and went over backward into the tangle of vines and shrubs , with Nohoch struggling frantically to extract his own knife from its sheath . The third man leaped at Balam Xoc with a muted cry , swinging his knife in an arc aimed at the old man 's throat . But Balam Xoc ducked and jumped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed at him again , he dodged past the knife and raked his fingers across the man 's face , evoking a howl of pain and surprise . The man recoiled momentarily , wincing as he raised his fingers to the bright red scratches on his cheek and forehead . But then the first assassin appeared at his comrade 's side , his knife red with the blood of Cab Coh , and the two of them began to stalk Balam Xoc , closing him in between them , leaving no angle for escape . Balam Xoc backed a few feet down the trail and stopped , baring his teeth like a cornered animal and snarling with such menace that both men hesitated for an instant in their approach . Suddenly there was a swish of wind followed by a hollow thunk , and the man with the clawed face stood up on his toes and clutched at his chest , from which a short , narrow spear was protruding . Waving his arms , he staggered backward and fell over Cab Coh 's body , his eyes rolling up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the assassin confronting him , and the man dropped his knife in dismay and fled into the forest , crashing blindly through the undergrowth in his desire to get away . Balam Xoc was still standing in the middle of the path when Kal Cuc appeared at his side , gripping his throwing stick tightly in both hands . Together they stared at the bloodstained bodies sprawled out on the ground in front of them , the white head of Cab Coh just visible beneath the limp arm of the assassin , whose clawed face was fixed in a death grimace . Kal Cuc began to shiver , and Balam Xoc laid a hand upon his shoulder , startling him with the coldness of his touch . " You have taken a life , my son , " he said gently . " But you did so to save mine , and to avenge the death of my brother . Pray for their spirits , my son . I must see to Nohoch . " Kal Cuc shivered again and went down on his knees , placing the throwing stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head close to the earth . Balam Xoc found Nohoch lying in a circle of crushed vegetation a few feet off the path , with the body of his assailant crumpled up beside him , the bonehandled knife sticking out of his ribs . Nohoch was holding his hip and moaning softly , his chest and arms covered with smaller wounds matted with dirt and leaves . He opened his eyes as Balam Xoc knelt beside him and put an arm under his head . " Grandfather , " he murmured . " You said this .. " Yes , " Balam Xoc agreed solemnly , turning his head as Kal Cuc came up behind him . " Go to Tzec Balam , my son . Tell him to bring bandages and a litter . Hurry ! " The bov ran off . and Balam Xoc looked back down at Nohoch. whose eves  | " My father ? " " He is dead . Murdered , as I was meant to be . " Nohoch groaned and let his eyes flutter shut . " Now we must be strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invocation . " Now it has truly begun . " " What ? " Nohoch asked in a confused whisper , beginning to drift off in his pain . Balam Xoc put his free hand on top of Nohoch 's hands , pressing back against the flow of blood from his wounded hip . " The battle for our lives , " he said succinctly . " The clan war ... "  | FEW BRIEF showers fell over Tikal during the last days of the month q of Pop , far too late for all but a small portion of the ruler 's crops . The wetness did not linger , though , and did not prevent the Jaguar Paw Clan from burning the dried brush they had laid over their gardens , transforming the ground cover into a grey-black layer of fertilizing ash . The planting was begun on the first day of Uo , and was interrupted on the second by a spectacular thunderstorm , during which a pyramid in one of the abandoned Katun Enclosures was struck by lightning . It was not until the ninth day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planting , that the uos finally appeared . A steady , soaking rain had fallen for most of the day , ending just before sunset . The insects and nightbirds had begun their monotonous nocturnal chorus , a droning chirrup so familiar and pervasive that the human inhabitants of the Jaguar Paw House did not distinguish it from silence . But suddenly there was a deep , resonant croak from somewhere in the vicinity of the lower plaza , and it had barely stopped echoing before a second , higher-pitched voice answered , and then another and another , rising from all sides at once and blending into a single , palpitating chant : whoa , whoa , whoa .. . The people came out of their houses , carrying torches and pointing in amazement at the sight that greeted their eyes . The tiny , red-spotted frogs were everywhere , hopping and crawling through the puddles on the plazas and puffing out their dark , gelatinous bodies in chorus after chorus of their name . Some could he seen hunched together , mating with the blind urgency of r r. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. ir rlr , r.r , wnry for . , nlv rnw niohf wwrh vwwr Th ..  | people laughed and shouted to welcome the uos , whose singing was thought to be the voice of Cauac the Rain Spirit , and a sign of his favor . Akbal was sitting with Kinich Kakmoo when the first uo sounded , and he immediately stopped talking and smiled at his brother , hoping that the uos ' singing might evoke a similar response in Kinich . Kinich did in fact raise his head as the sounds outside reached a deafening level , but he was not moved to smile . His eyes were dull and yellowish around the edges , sunken deep behind the broken hump of his nose . He had been home for ten days and had hardly moved from this barren room , sitting wrapped in a blanket against the chills of his fever , surrounded by his many medicines : salves for the sores on his feet and legs , harsh purgatives for the worms in his guts , potions for the fevers that made him shiver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sickness of his spirit , which Akbal had been trying vainly to alleviate with his conversation and company . Since he could not be heard above the noise of the uos , Akbal gestured with his hands to attract Kinich 's attention , indicating that they should go outside for a look . Then he went to get the torch from the holder on the wall , having already learned that Kinich would not permit anyone to help him , no matter how hard it was for him to rise or how unsteady he was upon his legs . Using the bench behind him , Kinich slowly pushed himself to his feet , reaching back for his spear , which he kept propped up beside him at all times . As he shuffled toward the door , grasping the spear like a staff , the blanket around his shoulders fell open , revealing a body that appeared as ruined as his nose : Hok 's body , wrapped in scarred folds of excess skin , Akbal had thought upon seeing Kinich naked for the first time . Now he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen , letting his brother go out before him . Kinich 's wife , May , and their two-year-old daughter , Coba , were also standing on the platform in front of the house , and May smiled and brought the child over to her father . Coba had her hands clapped over her ears , but was smiling and giggling , clearly enjoying the spectacle of the plaza filled with hopping frogs and ringed with torches and excited people . Akbal dipped his torch as he came through the doorway and then lifted it high overhead , illuminating the frogs that had found their way onto the platform itself . Coba let out a shriek and jumped back against her mother as one of the frogs flopped wetly at her feet , and Akbal and May both laughed , glancing self-consciously at Kinich for his reaction . To their distress , they saw him recoil from the scene in front of him , his mouth dropping open in an expression of bewildered horror . Then a spasm in his stomach nearly doubled him over , and he thrust his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stringy bile onto the pavement at his feet . Akbal and May quickly moved to support him , holding him up by the elbows when the spear dropped out of his shaking hands . When the convulsions in his stomach and throat had finally ceased , they half-led , half-carried him back inside , maneuvering around little Coba , who was crying and clinging to her mother 's skirt . They set him down with his back against the bench , wrapping more blankets around him , for he had begun to shiver violently . May had tears in her eyes as she and Akbal held Kinich between them , trying to nt : , in thy heInlexx tremhlino in hix hndv. nutxide the uos continued to hnnm  | out their song , so that no one could hear the terrified weeping of Coba , or the single word that Kinich kept murmuring to himself over and over : bats . THE FOUR WOMEN in the front room of Cab Coh 's house were close to the end of their ceremony when the uos began to sing , and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not falter or lose their composure . Standing in front of the bench where the ritual paraphernalia had been laid out , Box Ek held a pair of intricately carved bones over a brazier of burning coals , passing them back and forth through the fragrant smoke as she murmured the final prayer . Her eyes were moist with emotion , for these rites were for her brother Cab Coh , whose body lay buried beneath the floor in the next room , and whose spirit wandered somewhere in the Underworld , hopefully accompanied by the women 's prayers . Box Ek carefully laid the bones upon the ceremonial plate next to the brazier and bowed her white head over them for a moment before signaling the other women that they were done . They all bowed again and stepped back from the bench before turning to face one another , their expressions still masked with the solemnity of the occasion . The whoa-ing from outside had grown terrifically loud , and Box Ek recognized the pull it exerted upon them with a bleak smile , giving her arm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haleu to precede them out . The glow of hand-held torches cast a flickering light over the plaza , which was speckled with the dark bodies of a multitude of frogs . Box Ek could feel Zac Kuk 's excitement in the way the young woman gripped her arm , and the two of them exchanged a private glance as they came out onto the platform , sharing the memory of their visit to Balam Xoc . The old woman was gratified by the intimacy of Zac Kuk 's smile , a sign of the bond that had grown up between them since that day . The appearance of the uos made them think not of rain but of tears , and of the dream that had given legitimacy to the feelings of the people . At Balam Xoc 's bidding , they had already begun to plan the celebration the clan would hold when the period of mourning for Cab Coh was completed , and when Kinich Kakmoo and Nohoch Ich were both well enough to attend . Haleu bowed to attract Box Ek 's attention , gesturing to indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ek hastily gave her consent , knowing that Haleu was anxious to check on Nohoch , who was still healing , and on her mother-in-law , Pek , whose health had begun to deteriorate rapidly after the death of Cab Coh . Soon we will be weeping for her , Box Ek thought sadly , watching Haleu wend her way toward the adjacent house , stepping carefully around the frogs . Her son , Chac Mut , came halfway out of the central doorway as she approached , holding the netting back with one hand while sweeping a torch low over the platform with the other , illuminating the advance of the uos for whomever was watching from inside . Box Ek guessed that the hidden watcher had to be Nohoch himself , and she took his desire to see the uos as a positive sign , an indication that he was indeed recovering from his wounds . His condition had been a matter of grave concern for some time , a further source of tears , after those that had been shed for Cab Coh . The thnnaht of Cah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | for indulging it as she turned her gaze back over the plaza . It was not right to dwell upon her sorrow in the midst of this joyful din , this outpouring of life from the depths of the earth itself . Ixchel and Zac Kuk were waving across to the servants in front of Pacal 's house , one of whom was holding up young Bolon Oc and pretending to have him wave back . A crowd of celebrants lined the platform in front of Balam Xoc 's house , smiling and gesticulating , some even kneeling to try to gather the slippery frogs into their hands . As Box Ek watched , Balam Xoc and a few of his Close Ones detached themselves from the group and started toward the clan shrine that stood at the eastern end of the plaza . They had to move slowly to avoid stepping on the uos , and as they separated to find their own paths , Box Ek saw that one of them was Kanan Naab . The only woman among them , she reflected , yet wed to none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this time she could not suppress it , and the tears rolled freely down her withered cheeks . She felt Zac Kuk turn toward her solicitously , but she did not look up to accept the young woman 's comfort . Grateful as she was for Zac Kuk 's attentions , Box Ek knew that they could never replace those she had lost  --  those of her true granddaughter , the child she had come back from Ektun to raise so many years before . Kanan Naab was now climbing the steep temple stairs behind Balam Xoc , no doubt to participate in an offering of thanks to the Rain Spirit . Box Ek blinked to clear her eyes of tears , reminding herself that Kanan Naab had always been drawn to these things , even as a small child . It had been a mistake to discourage her , and to tell her she was being difficult and perverse when she was only being true to her deepest impulses . Yet Box Ek could not help but wonder what kind of life would be left to Kanan Naab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiness would cling to her , and preserve a place for her among the spiritual leaders of the clan . Or perhaps she would demonstrate powers of her own , sufficient to make her a candidate for the title of Living Ancestor , a title that Box Ek knew she secretly yearned to hold . But if not  --  if , in fact , tradition again prevailed after Balam Xoc 's passing  --  what would become of her then ? She could never again be simply an unmarried woman , not after being one of the Close Ones . And she seemed to be absorbing Balam Xoc 's coldness and indifference toward others . What man would want such a woman , knowing that her devotion would never be given solely to him ? Then Kanan Naab and her companions disappeared through the single doorway of the shrine , leaving Box Ek staring vacantly at the building 's dark facade , feeling that her granddaughter had passed beyond the reach of her concern . There is not much time left to me , she thought bleakly , as she had many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been the gentle one , the brother whose kindness never failed to reassure her . He should not have been the first to die , and a part of her own desire to live had departed with him . She doubted seriously , and without self-pity , that she would live long enough to hear the uos sing again . " You are sad , Grandmother , " Zac Kuk said in a concerned voice , bending to speak directly into Box Ek 's ear . The old woman strained against the aching stiffness in her neck and back to bring her face close to Zac Kuk 's . " I am too old for new beginnings . The joy of such things belongs to the voting . ' ?  | Zac Kuk pulled her face away far enough to give her a quizzical look . " Listen to their song , " Box Ek told her , pointing her stick at the frog-filled plaza . " It says that the world belongs to you ... " PACAL AND THE other chief stewards were meeting with the ruler when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the palace , intruding themselves into the council chamber . The sound was immediately recognizable , despite the distortions of distance , and it brought the stewards ' somber discussion to an abrupt halt . Caan Ac waved a hand to them in dismissal and rushed out of the room in the company of the high priest and his assistants . The stewards sat where they were for a moment , actually more relieved than irritated by the interruption , since it had saved them from hearing the ruler 's response to their reports , which had been uniformly disheartening . Pacal folded up the book of accounts he had used as a reference during his report and handed it to one of his assistants , telling him to confer with the scribes and make certain that all the amounts had been recorded correctly . Pacal felt strongly  --  though he did not say it to the assistant  --  that this would be his last report as the chief steward of crops , and he wanted it to be accurate . As if to confirm this suspicion , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him to remain behind and wait for Caan Ac 's return . The chamber had emptied out rather quickly , the other stewards also hastening out to observe the uos . And apparently no one else had been asked to stay behind . Pacal dismissed the rest of his assistants , wishing that Chac Mut were still among them . He would have appreciated his nephew 's company at a moment like this , as he waited to be discharged from the stewardship to which he had devoted his life . But Chac Mut had resigned his post shortly after the attack on his father and grandfather , and Pacal had not attempted to dissuade him . Other than the contracted workmen , Pacal was now the only member of the Jaguar Paw Clan still employed in the ruler 's service , and he would have resigned himself had he not felt obligated to complete his final report . The sound of the uos had begun to diminish in volume by the time the ruler returned and took his seat on the Jaguar Throne . He appeared drained and uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shins and forearms . He conferred briefly with the high priest before sending everyone from the room and beckoning Pacal to approach the throne . The torches on the walls crackled softly , providing an intimate counterpoint to the billowing echoes from outside . Caan Ac kept Pacal standing after he had bowed , studying his face with a mixture of mistrust and calculation , as if guessing at his responses in advance . " You know , of course , " he said at last , " that I must remove you as the chief steward of crops . " " I had assumed as much , my lord . " " Yes , " the ruler went on , watching him closely , " you will have to suffer a period of disgrace . Not long , probably . Perhaps you will want to go to Uaxactun for a while . Then you will return to serve me here , as an adviser , or perhaps wn wnvnv nthor , ? Iona "  | Pacal had already considered the possibility of such an offer , and he responded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I doubt that I could be of use to you in either capacity , given the way my clan is currently regarded in the city . If I can not be one of your stewards , Lord , I would humbly request to be released from your service . " Caan Ac 's demeanor changed abruptly , as if all his guesses had been confirmed , and he slapped himself loudly on the chest , making his jade necklaces dance . " I am not offering you a choice , Pacal . The appearance of your loyalty is enough , if that is all you can be trusted to give . And I will have it ! You will not leave me to become the steward of your father 's rebellion . " " I see . " " Do you ? " Caan Ac sneered , leaning toward him menacingly . " Do you truly ? No doubt you believe , like your father , that the thieves who attacked him were my agents . Do you not ? Speak , Pacal . You have no reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath , swallowing several inappropriately diplomatic replies . He had no doubt that the ruler had sent the assassins after Balam Xoc , and it offended him to be made the recipient of a false denial . But the instinct toward accommodation was still too strong in him to permit the utterance of such a disagreeable truth , even though he saw no hope of accommodation in the ruler 's eyes . " I have never pretended with you , my lord . Were they your agents ? " Caan Ac grunted rudely , his thick lips curling in disgust . " Even now , you equivocate . You should know that I would not concern myself with petty acts of revenge . I am the ruler of Tikal ; I have no need to employ assassins when I already possess the power to crush your entire clan . Do you understand me now ? I am not merely speaking of your life , or your father 's . There are many others who might go first . " Pacal stared back at him silently , thinking of Ixchel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . The ruler went on in the same , unsparing tone . " You will vacate the chamber of the chief steward of crops immediately , and then you will go to Uaxactun as my special envoy . You will be allowed to return , in time , if you heed my warning and do nothing to anger me . If you do otherwise , you will not wish to return , or to see what you have brought upon your people . " " You would hold me hostage , then , " Pacal said in a hollow voice , and the ruler narrowed his eyes and gave him a thin , predatory smile . " I would indeed . That is the only value you have for me now . Your father has seen to that . You will be released when he is no longer a threat to my authority , and not before . " " You must fear him greatly , " Pacal suggested impulsively , and the ruler 's smile vanished , wiped away by an angry snarl . " He is a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clan will dig in the mud for him ? They will grow tired of their isolation soon enough , and remember how it was to enjoy the favor of their ruler . " " As I have enjoyed it ? " Pacal retorted . " Or my sons ? " " Do not provoke me , Pacal , " Caan Ac threatened . " The screams of your dying would not he heard tonight . "  | " You spoke to me once of greatness , " Pacal reminded him , spitting the words out with undisguised scorn . " Of the prestige of Tikal . Yet now you make crude threats against me and my family , like a man well acquainted with assassins . Which of us has been pretending , my lord ? " Caan Ac clapped his hands sharply , and two of his guards came through the curtained doorway , their hands on their knives . But then the ruler reconsidered and sent them out again . " No , you will not escape me so easily , " he growled . " You will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have you taken there by force , bound like a turkey for the market . And remember , Pacal Balam : Perhaps your father can predict when the rains will come , but I doubt that he could bring them in time to save the Jaguar Paw houses from burning . Think of that before you consider betraying me to him . Now go ! " Pacal began to bow out of habit , but then caught himself and arrested the motion , his crossed arms raised just to the level of his stomach . Looking directly at the ruler , he deliberately let his arms drop to his sides , then turned and began to walk from the chamber . He expected at any moment to hear the ruler signal his guards , for the disrespect he had just shown was an offense punishable by death . The expectation caused him no fear , however ; if he had no more value to his city , he did not care what was done to him , or whether he lived or died . But the ruler let him go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damp night air , which resounded with the singing of the uos . He felt empty , numbed by a dim realization of how recklessly he had courted death . He raised his face to the dark sky , helpless in the sight of the ancestors , a man whose career had just ended and his captivity begun . The whoa- ing of the frogs filled his ears , drowning the cry of anguish that rose in his throat and was never released . He stood alone , waiting to be overwhelmed by his loss , waiting for the tears that did not come . Two months later , the month of Zotz CHAN MAC and his wife , Kutz , were the first outside guests to arrive for the Jaguar Paw feast , coming up the main trail in the rich yellow light of late afternoon . Chan Mac was wearing full diplomatic garb , to ease his passage through the city , and he was accompanied by two burly embassy guards , who carried the gifts he had brought for his sister and her family . Happening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in the long room , already dressed for the celebration but still working on an unfinished painting . He held up a hand to them in greeting and apology , appealing for a few more moments to complete his work . So Chan Mac led the others into the plaza beyond , where servants were already laying out food and drink beneath the thatched ramadas that had been set up in front of the houses . Zac Kuk was at the center of the preparations , seeing to a hundred things at once , but she greeted her brother and sister-in-law with an effusive smile and questions about their children . Leaving Kutz and the guards in her care , Chan Mac soon excused himself and went back to the craft house . Squatting Ix-side him at Akhal 's invitation , Chan Mac immediately saw that  | the painting was the one Akbal had done for Kinich Kakmoo in Yaxchilan , depicting the warrior presenting his captive to Shield Jaguar . Using the full complement of colors , Akbal had transferred the drawing from its original leather roll to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips of polished wood . " The Captor of Macaw , ' " Chan Mac recalled wistfully . " It might seem a perverse gift now . " " I am prepared for him to reject it , " Akbal admitted . " But we have tried everything else we know to rouse his spirit . I can not fail more miserably with this . But come , I am done here . Let me show you our gardens while it is still light . " They walked together through the shade of the breadnut trees , passing groups of colorfully dressed people coming the other way , heading for the feast with gifts and bunches of flowers in their arms . They greeted Akbal familiarly , calling out his name in a variety of accents . " Your grandfather 's followers ? " Chan Mac supposed aloud , returning the bows that were made to him . " Yes . Although many of them will join the clan tonight . " " I had heard rumors of this , long ago . Is there one among them named Hok ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could answer , they came out into the open again , and both stopped to admire the view . The placid waters of the reservoir were deep and green , except for the eastern portion , which had been dyed red by the slanting rays of the slowly descending sun . The clearings appeared to have been decorated in fresh green , the rows of leafy plants weaving around and between the remaining trees . Domesticated turkeys pecked over the well-beaten ground in front of the houses , which gleamed white against the surrounding green . " I heard rumors of this , as well , " Chan Mac said . " But I must confess , I did not believe that you could have accomplished so much in so little time . " " We all put our hands to the work , " Akbal said proudly . " Even your sister . And men like Hok . What do you know of him ? " " Very little . Your grandfather asked me to make some inquiries of the ambassador from Quirigua , who once held a post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned this man Hok directly , it seemed that the whole inquiry was connected with him , though in ways I do not fully understand . I have not had a chance to report to Balam Xoc until now . But tell me what you know of Hok . " " He is from Quirigua , " Akbal confirmed . " His father was a painter , a minor craftsman attached to the Sky Clan of that city . When Hok was just a boy , his father took him and his older brothers into the mountains to hunt for the plants and minerals used to make paints . Several days later , Hok came out of the mountains alone , covered with blood and dirt , and delirious with pain . One of his eyes had been put out with a stone , and he said that his father and brothers had all been killed . He claimed that they had been murdered by warriors wearing the insignia of the ruler of Quirigua . " Akbal paused , seeing the beginnings of comprehension in Chan Mac 's eyes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r ... , nrrinra Lnnwn /n tr. in the orao at the timr. hgsw .. v .. r unrl  | it seemed more likely that the killings were the work of some of the mountain tribesmen with whom Quirigua was feuding . It was assumed that Hok , in his pain and confusion , had merely mistaken them for Quiriguan warriors . But Hok would not change his story , even though he could not lead anyone back to the place where it happened , and was not even certain how he himself had managed to survive . He insisted so violently that finally , to break him of his delusion , the ruler of Quirigua assembled all of his warriors for the boy 's inspection . After looking at them all , Hok could identify only one man who he was certain had been among his father 's killers . That man was the ruler 's own brother , and he had been secluded in the clan house the whole time , fasting for a ceremony . " " Ah , " Chan Mac exclaimed softly . " But apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " Akbal agreed sadly . " He was tormented by bad dreams and fits of weeping , and he would attack any warrior he came across , biting and scratching like a wild beast . He finally became so unmanageable that he was sent to live with relatives in a more isolated part of the valley . But he ran away from them , and he has been wandering ever since . Until he came here . " Chan Mac nodded thoughtfully , looking out over the water for a moment and then around at the houses and gardens and groves of trees . " I understand why he stopped here , " he said with quiet admiration . " Especially since he seems to have found a believer in Balam Xoc . Perhaps I can corroborate that belief . " " It would be a gift to Hok , if he is able to accept it , " Akbal told him . " But perhaps you wish to tell Grandfather before anyone else . That is only proper . " " I am grateful for your understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these inquiries quietly . But I assume he will allow you to be present when I tell him what I have learned . " " One can assume nothing about Grandfather , " Akbal assured him bluntly . " He may repeat your words to the whole clan , or perhaps only to Hok himself . Eventually , though , we will hear what we need to know . " " Shall we return to the feast , then ? There are many other things we must talk about . It has been too long since I last had the pleasure of your company . " " Indeed , " Akbal said emphatically , turning to lead the way back to the Jaguar Paw House . " There are many stories we must tell tonight ... " THE SAME BOY who had brought the invitation was waiting for Yaxal Can , as he had promised , near the head of a little-used trail behind the houses of the Serpent Clan . He started off without speaking , and soon led the way onto an even smaller path that abandoned the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low marsh . The sun 's imminent disappearance made the boy hurry over the uncertain ground , leaping lightly from hummock to hummock as they crossed one end of a long alkalche . Yaxal followed with some difficulty , collecting mud on his sandaled feet and feeling sweat dampening his fine blue tunic and hcadwrap , garments that identified him as a member of the Order of Tun Count Priests . He was also aware of the need for haste  --  as much to avoid being seen as to see  --  but the possibility of  | concern . The furtiveness of this journey was already demeaning enough ; he did not need to arrive soiled and out of breath , as well . " Slower , my son , " he called to the boy , who obediently stopped and waited on the next hummock . Yaxal came up next to him , adjusting the tasseled incense bag he carried on a long strap slung over his shoulder . " I have forgotten your name , my son , " he said , as they resumed walking at a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who helped Akbal find the Serpent Stone . " " Kal Cuc , my lord , " the boy said over his shoulder . " Ah , yes . And how does Akbal fare , Kal Cuc ? " " He is the master of craftsmen now . He is very busy . " " No doubt . And his sister , the Lady Kanan Naab ? " The boy glanced back again , displaying a certain wariness toward these questions . " She is one of those close to the Living Ancestor , " he replied , and then fell silent , as if no further elaboration were necessary . They had once more found their way to dry ground , on the other side of the deep ravine that flanked the Jaguar Paw House to the north . Smoke from the clan cookhouses could be seen rising up through the trees on the far side , and the tall roof comb of the clan shrine stood out above the topmost branches , its carved stucco surface shimmering in the last light of the sun . The sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full moon had already risen in the east , an evanescent white disc against the blue . " It is a perfect night , " Yaxal said appreciatively , as Kal Cuc led him toward the path that went around the ravine . " Tell me , my son : Are there many other outside guests ? " " There are some who will come later , after dark . " " I see , " Yaxal mused , feeling less ashamed of his own precautions . " And was it the Lady Kanan Naab who sent you to invite me ? Or perhaps her father . " " Lord Pacal is in Uaxactun , " Kal Cuc said tersely , glancing at him with open suspicion , as if Yaxal should have known . " It was the Lady Zac Kuk who sent me to you . " Feeling slightly foolish , Yaxal nodded and let the boy lead on in silence . Of course he had known that Pacal was in Uaxactun  --  all of Tikal knew that ? but he had allowed himself to forget , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent . He had been asked to take a great risk in attending this feast , after all . If the ruler or the high priest were to hear of it , his career as a priest would be ended the next day . Would Zac Kuk have sent for him merely on a whim , heedless of the possible consequences ? But it was too late to turn back in anger . The houses were just ahead , barely visible in the swiftly falling darkness . Yaxal asked the boy to walk still slower , letting the shadows collect around them as they approached the Jaguar Paw House . rHr.

L. , , : ..  | his blankets , his back to the doorway , waiting for whoever it was to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouse him , bringing balche and a gift they said would give him pleasant memories . But Kinich had managed to discourage their attempt , without looking at either them or their gift . He had too many memories already , and found none of them pleasant . The person behind him seemed to be inspecting the room , sandals scraping softly on the plastered stone floor . Then Kinich heard nothing , though his awareness of another presence in the room did not diminish . Who was it this time ? May ? He had already told her that he would not attend the feast , and did not wish to have visitors . " Go away , " he said gruffly . " I am not well . " " I have come to heal you . " Kinich rolled over onto his side and saw Balam Xoc sitting a few feet away , silhouetted against the torchlight that shone through the mesh of the netting behind him . They regarded each other wordlessly for a few moments . " The moon is full , Kinich , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night are restless , and alert to our actions . They watch over us , as they watched over you in the jungle . You must rise and do them honor . " " What do you know about the jungle ? " Kinich asked uneasily . " Certainly nothing I have learned from you . You show us your suffering , but hide its cause . Your secrets are like the parasites inside you , Kinich . They are like creatures that feed upon you in the night ... " " You ! " Kinich blurted , forcing himself into a sitting position . He held out a hand to his grandfather , then pulled it back uncertainly , pressing against the rapid beating of his heart . " Even in this barren room , " Balam Xoc continued , " the jungle is still with you . Is it not ? " Kinich leaned back against the bench behind him , wheezing softly through his nose . His voice was thick with emotion when he could finally bring himself to speak . " I am there again whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rot ... I can see my men dying , again and again . " " Tell me . How many were lost ? " " Fourteen . " " Tell me , " Balam Xoc repeated insistently , and Kinich let out a long breath , venting the last of his resistance . Once he began to speak , the words seemed to tumble out of him of their own accord , spilling his secrets into the air . For the first time , he described how he and his men had escaped from the Macaw ambush , and how he had led them into the jungle . The Macaws had pursued them for many days , pushing them deeper and deeper into the wilderness , trying constantly to trap them between a land force and the Macaw canoes . But Kinich had waged the kind of jungle war for which he had been trained , backtracking on his pursuers and setting ambushes to pick off their scouts . They had finally killed so many Macaws that the enemy abandoned the pursuit , though not before Kinich and his band had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to matter at first , " Kinich said , with a rueful trace of remembered pride . " We had only lost two of our own , and each of us carried the insignia of'at least one dead Macaw . We felt that we had earned our escape . We fell like warriors. "  | Kinich stopped and licked dry lips , swallowing with difficulty . He went on in a subdued monotone . " But we had no supplies , and we were lost in a land we did not know . Few of us had any experience as hunters or fishermen , and the fear of becoming separated from the group kept us from going far after game . It rained constantly , and nothing ever dried ; our cotton armor grew mold and became a home for leeches and lice . We discarded it , and the mold grew on our skin , though it gave us no protection from the flies and mosquitoes . We caught fevers from drinking bad water , and then drank more when it seemed the fever 's thirst would kill us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then our own , keeping only our loincloths and our weapons . We fought the jungle like an enemy , and like an enemy it wore us down and killed us . " The boatmen were the first to go . Most did not even know how to walk in the jungle , how to test the ground in front of them with their spears and look before they stepped . I saw one of them stumble headlong into a pool that was concealed by a thick mat of waterlilies . It was also filled with crocodiles , and the man was being eaten before he could even scream . No one was close enough to save him . Another man became impatient with those in front and cut his own path through a thicket , where he stepped on a sleeping serpent , a yellow jaw . He screamed until the breath left him and he died , his face purple and his leg swollen to the size of a tree trunk . " My warriors were equally inexperienced with water , and two of them drowned trying to cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering their lives out in my arms . It was hunger , though , that truly killed them . They would have survived if I could have fed them properly . Hunger and despair also drove one of the boatmen to hang himself with a vine rope , and his two remaining comrades ran away in the night shortly afterward . Two other warriors were lost during the last days of our journey , on the march . They simply were not with us when we stopped to rest , and we were too sick and exhausted to go back to look for them . " " That is thirteen , " Balam Xoc prompted , when Kinich seemed reluctant to continue . " Who was the last ? " " My second-in-command , Tzimin . It happened on the last night , before we came upon the woodsmen who took us to Palenque . Tzimin was dead when we awoke in the morning , and at first we could not understand why . He appeared to have been strangled , but there were no marks on his throat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found the coral snake under his body , trapped beneath his arm . It must have crawled into his armpit while he slept , and when it bit , he crushed it as if it were an insect , driving its fangs deep into his own flesh . It was no longer than my finger , " Kinich murmured in a tone of bitter amazement , " a pretty thing , banded with red and black and yellow . It looked like a necklace , like a child 's necklace . " Kinich suddenly buried his face in his hands and began to weep , his head hunched down between his bony shoulders . Balam Xoc waited patiently for him to recover , ignoring the sounds that came through the netting behind him . " They are gone , Kinich , and you must put them to rest , " he said when Kinich 's tears were spent . He pushed a stoppered gourd and a painted pottery cup across the floor toward him . " Drink this , " he commanded . " It is balche that was prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chihil . It will  | Kinich poured himself a cup with shaking hands and drank it down , then sat with his head cocked warily , awaiting the result in his gut . After a moment , he belched slightly and rested a hand on his stomach , as if to reassure himself . Then he poured another cup , but looked across at Balam Xoc before drinking . " You have heard all of my secrets , Grandfather . But you have not even told me why you wish to heal me . " " There is no mystery . You are needed here . My brother was killed by assassins , and Nohoch badly wounded . It was a boy who saved me ; a boy using the Zuyhua weapon you took from the Macaws . We will need our warriors in the time ahead . " " Yet you had no use for me when I was healthy , " Kinich said suspiciously . " You spoke of the warriors with scorn . " " I have no use for wars of conquest , " Balam Xoc corrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would squander the lives of their warriors in senseless attempts to enlarge their own prestige . You have learned nothing from your experience if you do not feel the same . " Kinich struggled with himself for a moment before again tipping the cup to his lips . His hands were steadier when he poured for the third time , watching the stream of amber liquid glitter in the torchlight from outside . " No matter what I might feel , " he said tentatively , looking up at Balam Xoc , " I am still a nacom of Tikal . I have taken a vow to serve the ruler . " " No title may supersede the obligations of your blood , " Balam Xoc told him bluntly . " You are a Jaguar Paw , and your highest duty is to the clan , and to the spirits of the ancestors . They did not desert you when you were lost in the jungle . You must not desert them now . " " And my vow to the ruler ? " " Can you possibly owe him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ten others back from the death to which he sent you . Surely , you will not allow him to send you there again . " It was a statement , not a question , and Kinich finally nodded in agreement , unable to find an argument against it . He raised the painted cup to Balam Xoc , then drained it in a single swallow . " Heal me , then , " he wheezed , as the heat of the balche sprang upward from his stomach . " I will be the warrior you need . " THE MOON HUNG like a bright , blue-white fan behind the roof comb of the clan shrine when Kanan Naab came out of her uncle Nohoch 's house and surveyed the people milling about in the plaza in front of her . A cursory glance told her that Balam Xoc was not among them , for their attitudes were all too casual and unfocused . The eating and drinking continued near the ramadas , but the women were now mingling with the men , who were puffing on long cigars made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups or chased one another around and between the talking , gesturing adults . The men with whom Kanan Naab had been meeting  --  to discuss the final details of the adoption ceremony scheduled for later in the evening  --  went off in different directions , leaving her alone on the platform . She scanned the crowd again , wondering where her grandfather had disappeared to . He had attended their meeting only briefly , departing as soon as he had answered the  | of her distance from this celebration , which was fused in her mind with the rebuke she had received from Box Ek at the reservoir . She had come to accept the wisdom of such a gathering , and she could see that it was having its desired effect upon the people before her . But she could not forget the circumstances under which it had been conceived , or the accusations of heartlessness that had preceded it . Her lack of feeling had been demonstrated to her so conclusively that it was impossible now to feel that she deserved to share in the clan 's joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crowd in front of her turned as one toward the sound , abandoning their own conversations . Then someone near the top of the stairs leading down to the other plaza turned and shouted a name : " Kinich Kakmoo ! " The crowd began to move toward the stairs , and Kanan Naab moved with them , cutting across the edge of the plaza and entering the avocado and cherry trees that lined the top landing above the gully . Ducking beneath the low branches , she found a place where she could stand upright and see the whole of the plaza below . A circle of space had been left around the two men in the center of the plaza : one the familiar , white-haired figure of Balam Xoc , and the other that of Kinich , a blanket wrapped loosely around his broad shoulders and a long , flint-tipped spear in one hand . As the crowd around them grew still , the people on the stairs and along both landings also fell silent . Addressing only those immediately surrounding him , Balam Xoc began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who bowed deeply to Balam Xoc before taking a place beside her husband . Then Box Ek , who had seen the signs of Kinich 's return , was called forward , along with Zac Kuk , who had helped to bring the message to Balam Xoc . Kinich bowed to both of them , and to Nohoch Ich and Kal Cuc , the clan 's other , unofficial warriors . The words they exchanged were audible to only a few , but no words were required by the rest of those looking on . They understood the significance of the battered spear in Kinich 's hand , and the reason why his bows were so awkward and labored ; they recognized the women and the boy , and they knew very well why Nohoch walked with a limp and carried a knife in his waistband . Finally Akbal was called forward , his cloth-wrapped head visible above those around him as he worked his way to the circle of space in front of Kinich . He was carrying a flat , rectangular bundle in his arms , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers faced each other , the Tikal Painter and the nacom of Tikal , brothers whose accomplishments in Yaxchilan had once split the clan . Akbal slowly opened the bundle and held it in front of his chest with outstretched arms . It was obviously a painting of some kind , though Kanan Naab could make out none of the details at her distance . Balam Xoc gestured toward it , and at a nod from Kinich , Akbal handed the long folding screen to Nohoch Ich and Tzec Balam , who lifted it over their heads and turned slowly to display its brilliant colors to the crowd . " The Captor of Macaw , " Tzec Balam announced in a loud voice , touching off a chorus of approving murmurs that increased in volume as everyone was given a glimpse of the painting . Then Kinich handed his spear to Balam Xoc and stepped forward on unsteady legs , raising his arms at his sides for balance until Akbal reached him and they wrapped each other in an embrace . The  | crowd let out a spontaneous roar , whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The circle of onlookers closed in around the two brothers , touching their arms and shoulders and calling out their names , and the people on the stairs and landings again began to descend toward the plaza , wanting to share in the joy of this reconciliation . Kanan Naab did not move from beneath the trees , waving absently at a mosquito as she watched the plaza below her fill completely with excited people . Then a voice spoke very close behind her , a voice she had not heard in months . " I see why you do not wish to leave this , my lady . There is little cause for celebration among the other clans of this city . " " Yaxal , " Kanan Naab said in an amazed whisper , turning to face him . He was standing sideways in the bright light of the moon , which painted leafy shadow-patterns on his face and headwrap . " But you are weeping , " he said in astonishment . " How can you be sad in the midst of your people 's joy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naab murmured plaintively , the tears continuing to stream down her face as she cast a brief glance back at the plaza . " Even within my own family , I have lost my place . They think I am cold and heartless . " " That can not be , my lady , " Yaxal protested . " It was the members of your family  --  the Lady Zac Kuk and the Lady Box Ek  --  who had me brought here tonight . " " They pity me . " " They are concerned for your happiness , " Yaxal assured her soothingly . " Besides , are you not close to your grandfather ? " Kanan Naab turned away for a moment , dabbing at her eyes with the edge of her sleeve . " No one can be close to him anymore , " she said in a more composed voice , yet one that could not conceal her regret . " He is truly a person without feelings . Those of us who serve him know this better than anyone else . We exist only to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . Our doubts and questions are not important to him . " Yaxal regarded her silently , letting her hear the sound of her own complaint , as if aware that she had not articulated it before , even to herself . " Perhaps you have also joined a priesthood , " he suggested softly , toying with the incense bag at his side . " Is that not what you have always wanted , Kanan Naab ? " Her eyes fixed on him thoughtfully , taking in his headwrap and the incense bag and searching his face for signs of disapproval or judgment . " Perhaps , " she admitted finally . " I was afraid of many things as a child . I believed that knowledge would protect me from my fear . I still believe it , though I have learned very little . " " Every novice is impatient to know , " Yaxal pointed out . " Yet first they must prove their willingness to serve . It seemed to me once that your grandfather indulged you too easily . Perhaps he will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his instruction . " Kanan Naab stared at him curiously , bemused by his apparent acceptance of her as a novice .  | " You once indulged me , as well , " she recalled . " And you indulge me now . You took a great risk in coming here . " " Yes , " Yaxal agreed without hesitation . " I allowed myself the delusion that the invitation had come from you , or your father . But I do not regret accepting it , now . " " But there can be no possibility of a marriage now . I say this for your own sake . You would be expelled from your order simply for proposing it . " " I have no delusions about that . " " Yet you came here tonight , to see me . " Yaxal shifted uneasily and coughed into his hand , stirring the branches overhead with his movements . " When I first came to the Jaguar Paw House , I was not looking for a wife , " he confessed . " I did not have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform a service for him , and I hoped to benefit from his acquaintance and that of your uncle , Nohoch Ich . I am not ashamed of my ambition , for my family is not wealthy , and my father has been dead for many years . But it was you , Kanan Naab , and not ambition , that made me return here . I would like to come again , if you will allow it . " Kanan Naab raised her hands , as if grasping at the possibility , but then let them drop in a hopeless gesture . " I could not ask you to take such a risk . " " You do not have to ask , " Yaxal persisted . " You have only to say that you will see me . " " I will , then , " Kanan Naab decided , and Yaxal permitted himself a small smile . " I must leave you now . The moon is high , and there are many other outsiders here . I can not trust them as I do the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kanan Naab offered , but he shook his head firmly . " I can find my own way . You must give my apologies to the Lady Zac Kuk and the Lady Box Ek . And my gratitude . They have not forgotten you , Kanan Naab , any more than I had . " " Yes , " Kanan Naab agreed in a chastened whisper . " Go safely , Yaxal . " She held out a moon-dappled hand to him , and he touched his fingers to hers lightly , caressingly , before ducking his head under the branches and striding off across the plaza . Kanan Naab raised the hand to her face and found that her cheek was warm and dry , her tears vaporized by the flush of heat rising from her skin . Her heart was beating with an insistence that made her breath come rapidly , so that finally she could not stand still any longer and left the sheltering trees to join the joyful people in the plaza below . IN PRESENTING his drawing to Kinich , Akbal had signaled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bags and bundles suddenly materialized from every corner of the plaza . Chan Mac could not locate either his wife or the embassy guards in the crowd around him , so he went himself to Akhal 's house , where he had been told his gifts were stored . Half of the front platform had been covered with a thatched ramada , and the serving women seated beneath it accosted Chan Mac with offers of halche and freshly whipped cacao . He merely smiled and shook his head , patting his ample belly as a convincing  | sign of his satisfaction . He paused outside the house 's central doorway to announce himself , then pushed through the netting and entered the torchlit front room . The bundles he had brought were stacked up just inside the doorway , and he squatted beside the pile to select the gifts he wished to distribute first , recalling the contents of the bundles by means of their wrappers . As he straightened up to leave , though , his eyes fell upon the mural that Akbal had painted upon the back wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study it . It had been many months since he had last seen the green hills of Ektun , the city beside the deep , winding river . My home , he thought , the home I left to come here . He stood with his back to the doorway and stared at the wall , oblivious of the noises of the celebration outside . When he finally came out of the house with one of the gift bundles under his arm , he was unprepared for the noise and commotion that greeted him . The crowd immediately in front of the house had thickened considerably , and the shock of their presence , in his meditative state , left him too stunned to recognize any of their faces . Several of the people seemed to be beckoning to him , and gradually he saw that two of these were Akbal and Zac Kuk , and that they were calling him over to meet with Balam Xoc . He went forward hesitantly , regaining his composure in time to bow to the old man , who was dressed very simply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose on his shoulders . " So , Chan Mac , " Balam Xoc said appraisingly , " you have come to our feast . Are you here merely to observe , or have you come to join us ? " Chan Mac looked back at him blankly , startled by the bluntness of the proposition . " I am here as a guest , at the invitation of my sister and her husband . " " It was so easy ? " Balam Xoc inquired . " Your superiors gave their permis-sion ? " " No , " Chan Mac admitted slowly , " but as perhaps you know , the ruler of Tikal has tried to blame the failure of the campaign upon Zotz Mac and the warriors of Ektun . The relations between our cities have been no better , lately , than those between your own clan and Caan Ac . Under the circumstances , there was no reason to fear his displeasure at my coming here . " " That is our good fortune , then , " Balam Xoc decided . " Akbal has told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have . Some time ago , you asked me to speak to the ambassador from Quirigua . I have done so . " " Tell me , " Balam Xoc commanded , but Chan Mac glanced uncertainly at the circle of listeners who surrounded them , lingering for a moment on Akbal , who could only shrug . Balam Xoc made a peremptory gesture that reclaimed Chan Mac 's attention and dispensed with confidentiality at the same time , drawing the people in tightly around them . " As you requested , " Chan Mac began , " I asked the ambassador about Quirigua 's relations with the mountain tribes around them . And although he was puzzled by my interest at first , he spoke freely when I persisted . He told me that there were certain tribes of Szinca speakers who had long resisted the civilizing influence of Quirigua and who would not accept the protection of the ruler . This had gone on for many years , with occasional episodes of open  | conflict . I understood from other things he said  --  and from what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned the sources of jade , which the mountain people controlled and kept as their own secret . Obviously , the ruler of Quirigua would prefer to mine the jade himself rather than trade for it with the Szinca . " " Obviously , " Balam Xoc agreed drily . " Then I asked the ambassador if he remembered an incident that occurred some twelve years ago , involving a painter and his sons , one of whom was named Hok . I mentioned this quite casually , saying that I had heard of it from another , but still he became very suspicious . He would say only that the painter and his sons had been avenged many times over , though it was clear that he remembered the incident well , and that the memory made him uncomfortable . When I pressed him about the fate of Hok , he said that the boy had been permanently deranged by the experience and had made wild accusations against innocent people . " Chan Mac stopped , realizing that the crowd around him had grown , and become utterly still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Balam Xoc prompted , and Chan Mac grimaced slightly in recollection . " I asked if he was not one of the people who had been accused , and if it was not true that he had been alone in his seclusion at the time of the incident , with no one to verify his whereabouts . That is when the ambassador lost his temper and told me I had betrayed his trust . He sent me away , and has not spoken to me since . " " How do you interpret such a response ? " Balam Xoc asked , eyeing Chan Mac shrewdly . " You know this man , do you not ? " " Well enough to know that his anger was not that of innocence . The death of the painter was no doubt a provocation useful to the ruler ; it gave him cause to send his warriors into the mountains . I might have thought otherwise had the ambassador shown more pity toward the boy , but the name of Hok aroused a quite different emotion in him , one closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a boy would evoke such a reaction if they were truly wild and unjust . " " Indeed , " Balam Xoc concurred , nodding to Chan Mac with what appeared to be satisfaction . Chan Mac realized that the only sounds in the plaza were isolated voices on the outskirts of the crowd , repeating what they had heard to those behind them . His private message for Balam Xoc , which he had discreetly withheld from Akbal , had been turned into a public performance . Balam Xoc inclined his head to the right and spoke out of the corner of his mouth , to someone behind him . " Come forward , my son . " Chan Mac had noticed the man 's face over Balam Xoc 's shoulder , a malnourished , unsavory face that had instinctively repelled him , so that he had tried not to notice the man edging forward during the course of his recitation . Now he saw the pale , sightless eye half-hidden by the man 's greasy hair , and felt a pang of guilt at his own revulsion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balam Xoc said to the man , who stood with his head hunched down between his bony shoulders , clearly uncomfortable with all the attention being paid him . " You are freed of your burden now ;  | you need punish yourself no more . The blood of your father and brothers is on the hands of the ruler of Quirigua and his brother . You will not be hurt again for possessing the truth . You will be our witness , Hok , the one who is called upon to verify the vows and agreements of our people . " Balam Xoc 's words were communicated back through the crowd , which responded with a deep , concerted murmuring . Zac Kuk leaned forward at Balam Xoc 's other side to whisper something in the old man 's ear , showing him what appeared to be a strip of cloth that she held coiled in her hands . Balam Xoc nodded vigorously and turned to present her to Hok . " The sister of Chan Mac also has a gift for you , my son . " Hok drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his muscles as Zac Kuk came up to him . Standing on her toes , she reached up toward his face , pausing in mid-motion when he shied away from her and pulled his head back . She spoke to him in a voice too low to hear , coaxing him patiently until he finally inclined his head toward her . Then she gently brushed the tangled hair away from his face and proceeded to tie the strip of cloth around his sloping forehead , adjusting it at an angle that brought the band low over his bad eye . Only when she stepped back , allowing Hok to raise his head , could the rest of the crowd see the true nature of her gift . The headband was of yellow cloth embroidered with black spots , and attached to it was a round black patch that hung neatly over Hok 's sightless eye . The transformation it effected in his appearance was so striking that several of the onlookers gasped in amazement , causing Hok to blink his good eye and raise his fingers to the patch in uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the band and patch had wrought a remarkable improvement , making him appear both less disheveled and less wild . His good eye seemed fierce and adamant , rather than crazed , and his sharp , hollowed features seemed cleansed without the tangled curtain of hair to disguise and disfigure them . Hearing the complimentary sounds swell up around him , Hok lowered his fingers and bowed to Zac Kuk , and then to Chan Mac , crossing his arms over his chest . " I am grateful , " he said in his harsh voice , which made the words sound awkward and unfamiliar to him , but no less sincere . Balam Xoc waved his arms over his head to indicate that the performance was over , and the crowd began to separate and disperse , resuming their gifting . Remembering the bundle under his arm , Chan Mac held it out to Balam Xoc , but the old man interrupted before he could speak . " You must give that to whoever needs it most , " Balam Xoc told him . " That is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the gratitude you receive , even if it comes from someone you do not know , will be much more genuine than any you might receive from me . The ruler has created scarcity in our midst , but in doing so , he has also restored the meaning and value of generosity . We do not exchange gifts as the emissaries of rulers do , solely for advantage or prestige . But first I must speak to you privately . Come . You as well , Akbal ... " Leaving Hok and his other retainers waiting behind him , Balam Xoc led the two young men off to the end of the platform , where they would not be overheard . He addressed Akbal first .  | " How soon will you be finished with your work , my son ? " " It has gone slowly , due to lack of materials , " Akbal explained . " But many of the people have made gifts to the master of craftsmen tonight , answering my needs . I have no doubt I can be finished by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned to Chan Mac , staring at him in silence for a moment , letting him feel the force of his presence , which seemed much stronger without a crowd to absorb and deflect it . " Have you an excuse to return to Ektun at that time ? " " I am allowed a visit to my family , yes , " Chan Mac admitted warily . " I was thinking of this earlier in the evening , in fact . " " We have goods to deliver in your city . Surely you would give our porters the benefit of your protection on the journey . " Chan Mac gave him a thin smile . " I could not do so openly , my lord . But if my party were to grow in number upon the trail , I would have to consider all of them as my own . " " It will be arranged , then , " Balam Xoc concluded brusquely . He looked up at the bright , full moon and then at Chan Mac , as if gauging the way the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that you are not ready to join us , since you can do us this service . But you will join us , and soon . " " Forgive me , my lord , " Chan Mac protested , politely but firmly . " I am impressed by what I have seen here tonight , and by the spirit of your people . But I did not abandon my clan and my city when I accepted a place in our embassy here . I fear that you have mistaken the nature of my interest in you and your people . " " What purpose does your interest serve , then ? Are we an amusement to you ? You have seen the kind of men who rule our cities , and the way they squander everything that is precious . Ektun is not immune to this . You hide from the truth , Chan Mac . You know that we are the hope of the future , if there is to be one . " " Is it not enough to be a friend and ally ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , perhaps , when we are stronger . We are at war now , and we need everyone who will fight with us . A friend in the palace is useless to us , and to himself . " Stubbornly resisting the pressure Balam Xoc was exerting upon him , Chan Mac put his hands on his hips and let out a long breath , glancing at Akbal for support . But his friend 's face was blank and noncommittal , offering neither sympathy nor encouragement . Chan Mac looked back at Balam Xoc , whose gaze was relentlessly expectant . " I can promise you nothing , " he said in a tight voice . " But I will discuss this with my father when I am in Ektun . " " The choice is yours , " Balam Xoc replied , seeming unperturbed by Chan Mac 's grudging tone . " There is a place for you here when you are ready to claim it . I must go now , and prepare for the adoption ceremony . " Acknowledging their bows with a brief wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small group still waiting for his return . Chan Mac pursed his lips and gave Akbal a sour look . " You did not prepare me for this , my friend . " " I warned you to assume nothing . I should have warned you , as well , to expect anything . "  | " That is not possible , for a diplomat , " Chan Mac said , shaking his head . He looked down at the gift bundle that was still in his hands and shrugged . " Perhaps you can help me distribute this . I feel a need for some of the gratitude your grandfather mentioned . " " You will have it , " Akbal assured him with a smile , and led him gently , solicitously , back into the crowd . SET ATOP a pyramid platform at the eastern end of the upper plaza , the clan shrine was a squat , thick-walled building only half as tall as the painted stucco roof comb it supported . It contained two vaulted rooms , one behind and slightly above the other , reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up the steep pyramid steps one at a time , and were greeted in the front room by Kanan Naab and Chibil , who gave them balche to drink and escorted them to the threshold of the inner room when their turn for the oath had come . Each of the candidates carried a blood-letter  --  a sharp sliver of bone or obsidian or stingray spine  --  that had been given to them by their sponsors , and Kanan Naab could feel their anxiety at the imminent prospect of drawing their own blood . She knew this particular fear very well from her own experience , and did her best to comfort and reassure them , murmuring in a low tone so as not to disturb the ritual being performed in the inner chamber . The power of her empathy , which had a visibly calming effect upon the candidates , was at first surprising to her , a power she had completely forgotten she possessed . But Chibil , who was practiced in these matters , quickly perceived the success her young companion was having and began to defer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own duty . Kanan Naab felt this power grow with each candidate she greeted , so that soon she did not have to speak or murmur at all : She had simply to be there with them , emanating the fearlessness that had come to her on the night she sought her own vision , when the spirits of the ancestors had guided her hand and allowed her to feel no pain . She knew , dimly , that Yaxal was responsible for releasing this power , which had lain dormant within her since that night . But she could not think of him now , with the voice of Balam Xoc reciting the words of the oath behind her and the heady smell of copal surrounding her where she stood , her senses keenly attuned to the person in her care . Then Opna appeared in the moonlit doorway , holding the serrated piece of stingray spine that Kanan Naab had given him herself . He had asked her to be his sponsor when the ceremony was first being planned , and she had complied almost without thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had long been intimidated by his learning and his supercilious manner ? acquired during his days as a priest in Copan  --  and she had been flattered that he found her worthy . Now , however , his presence had a subtly disenchanting effect upon her , disrupting her aura of quiet courage by refusing to pay it any heed . He took the cup of balche from Chibil without looking at her , and drank from it with a steady hand , betraying no hint of nervousness . Indeed , his attitude seemed to say that nothing here could daunt him or make him look to another for support . When he finally did look at Kanan Naab , there was condescension in his gaze , as well as something vaguely challenging . Kanan Naab realized  | that she had felt this challenge from him on other occasions , though she had never allowed herself to acknowledge it as such . She could not understand the reason for it , except as a form of intimidation that seemed completely unnecessary , and made her regret having agreed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that he had chosen her only because she was Balam Xoc 's granddaughter , which could perhaps lend an extra measure of legitimacy to his own membership in the clan . When the previous candidate came out of the inner room , his shins and forearms bloodied and his eyes glazed , Kanan Naab and Chibil bowed and helped him through the outer doorway , where others waited to escort him down the temple stairs . Then the two women returned to Opna and escorted him the few steps to the threshold of the next room . They could go no farther , for no woman had ever been permitted entrance to the most sacred precinct of the shrine . Few women had ever seen the inside of this chamber , and Kanan Naab had been content when Balam Xoc had granted her and Chibil that honor . Yet as Opna stepped up into the dark , smoky chamber , she felt a strong surge of resentment that she could not follow . She , who was Jaguar Paw in both blood and spirit , and who had once gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only unjust but simply wrong  --  a tradition no longer suited to the religious practices of the clan . In serving Balam Xoc , she and Opna were both novices , as were all of the other Close Ones . Reluctantly following Chibil 's lead , she turned back toward the outer doorway , where another candidate was waiting to enter . But the older woman stopped her and reached out to take her hands , putting her concern into her eyes , urging Kanan Naab to recapture her state of calm . Kanan Naab felt the greater warmth of Chibil 's hands and realized that her resentment had drained the warmth from her own . Nodding gratefully , she closed her eyes for a moment to compose herself , putting Opna out of her thoughts as firmly as she had Yaxal . Then she turned to greet the next candidate with fresh purpose , already beginning to feel the power flowing back into her .. . THE TORCHES around the upper plaza had all been extinguished , rendered superfluous by the bright , milky illumination of the moon , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the clan shrine , they formed a long line in the center of the plaza , which was surrounded on all sides by the blood members of the clan and their guests . When the last of the adoptees had taken his place at the end of the line , Balam Xoc emerged from the shrine 's single doorway and stood for a moment looking down upon them . He wore jaguar-skin leggings and a loose headwrap of the same material , with a water lily pinned to its side ; jade earplugs dangled from his ears , and his face and bare chest had been painted with stripes of red and black . He came down the stairs slowly , followed by Nohoch Ich and Tzec Balam , Kanan Naab and Chibil , and the others who had assisted in the ritual . He went to the head of the line and turned to survey the group , gesturing for the sponsors to take their places . Nohoch took his place beside Hok , who had been given the honor of being first in the line , and Tzec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kanan Naab lined up next to Opna , and Akbal stood  | proudly with Kal Cuc , the only boy to have received the oath . Others filled in behind , until none of the new members was left unescorted . " Now we are all Jaguar Paw , " Balam Xoc announced , his words echoing across the silent , moon-swept plaza . " Now we will dance as one . " A single drum began to beat , and Balam Xoc turned and began a slow , shuffling dance , leading the line to the edge of the plaza before circling to his right . Nohoch limped along after him , his awkwardness nearly overshadowed by that of Hok , who hopped and flailed his arms with every beat of the drum . Kanan Naab tried to match her steps with those of Opna , but soon fell into her own rhythm , since he seemed determined to keep himself just slightly ahead of her . The dancers made one full circuit of the plaza before the other members of the clan began to join the line at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mothers with sons , cousins with one another . The line stretched and grew until only the very old and infirm , and the outside guests , stood watching from the side . With solemn , rhythmic steps , the line of dancers circled and curled back upon itself , filling the plaza like a great , multicolored serpent , coiled and ready to defend itself , shimmering dangerously in the moonlight .. .  | AFTER ANNOUNCING himself to the servant , Akbal waited outside t doorway of Batz Mac 's house , as he had every morning since his arriv in Ektun . By now , it was stubborn courtesy rather than hope that ke him standing in the hot sun , holding the skirt that Zac Kuk had embroider for her mother and the wooden hairpins that he had carved and paint himself . It had not occurred to him before he set out that gaining an audien with his mother-in-law would prove more difficult than slipping out of Tik unnoticed . Finally Batz Mac himself appeared , the heavy folds of his round face fixi in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform . " She will not see you , my son . She is adamant . " " If I could only give her these gifts , and the messages from Zac Kuk , " Akb proposed , " I would not stay to try to justify myself . " " I am sorry , Akbal . She feels that you deceived her in regard to your fami and your prospects in Tikal . I must say that I share some of her feeling Surely , I never thought that my daughter would be made to work like commoner , or that you , the Tikal Painter , would have to sneak out of yoi city disguised as a porter . " " I was a porter , " Akbal said , trying to make it sound like a simple stateme of fact . " We could not spare enough men for all we had to carry . There is r disgrace in doing what has to he done . " " You see ? " Butz Mac pointed out . " You can not help but try to justi vourwelf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lord ? " Akbal asked quietly . " I have not fully explained myself to you , either . " Batz Mac briefly turned his eyes away , his lips puckering with discomfort . " You must be patient , " was the best he could offer , though . " Perhaps Chan can persuade her to change her mind . " Akbal made a polite bow , deciding not to ask what would change his mind and make him apply some pressure on his wife . Akbal could not afford much more patience , having promised his grandfather that he would not keep the porters away any longer than was required . And his business here would be concluded as soon as he was able to see the high priest , Ah Kin Tzab , who had thus far been too ill to receive him . Walking quickly back across the courtyard to Chan Mac 's house , he left the gifts in the room that had been given to him and slipped out again without alerting Kutz to his presence . She had already spent enough time entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she needed to see more . He also knew where to go to be alone , though he certainly had not expected to be seeking solitude on this visit . He had anticipated long hours of talk both with his in-laws and with the high priest , and at least two days of bargaining with the friends and relatives whose goods he had brought . Instead there had been no talk at all , and very little in the way of bargaining . Ektun had also had a bad crop , and in addition , Zotz Mac had been forced to levy stiff new taxes to support the ongoing struggle with the Macaws . No one had either the means or the inclination to trade for crafts , and Akbal had quickly perceived that his presence was an embarrassment to them , an added reminder of the desperate state of their city . Feeling the sun 's heat through his headwrap , Akbal followed the path through the copal trees to the pool on the bluff , where he had once gone to cool his frustrated longings for Zac Kuk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed perverse that he should be equally frustrated now , when his only wish was to tell Batz Mac and Muan Kal of their daughter 's happiness in Tikal . That had seemed like a gift that no parent could spurn , even if its bearer had come unannounced , in the guise of a porter . Shaking his head , he took a seat under the palms at the edge of the bluff , for it was too hot to sit in the open near the pool . By arching his neck , he could see down into the valley to the north , where part of the stream had been dammed off to form a long , deep pool . Several canoes filled with apprentice warriors were maneuvering in the confined space , readying themselves for a practice assault upon the shore , where another group of apprentices wearing red helmets was waiting to repulse them . Those on the shore were brandishing handfuls of slender sticks , which they had already begun to throw at the canoes . Akbal turned his back to the river and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief time here . He had almost thought that he had come to Yaxchilan by mistake , so prevalent were the signs of preparation for war . The Macaws had not waited for the campaign to be forgotten before resuming their raids on Ektun 's outlying dependencies , and despite having most of his army intact , Zotz Mac had been compelled to recruit additional warriors to man the garrisons along the northern frontier . There was also talk c - A . , .. 0  --  A I.. ve. a.ao. , e.:n r  | the losses of the campaign , was attempting to reassert its control . Akbal understood few of the details , having seen almost as little of Chan Mac as he had of his friend 's parents , but it was abundantly clear that Ektun and its allies were paying an increasingly heavy price for the defense of their territories . A flock of yellow-billed toucans were thrashing about in the treetops on the other side of the ravine , their harsh croaks barely audible behind the loud , hypnotic buzzing of the locusts . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had descended upon the fields just before harvest , wiping out most of the crop in a matter of days . One of Akbal 's relatives had suggested to him , only half in jest , that the locusts had migrated west after finding nothing to eat in Tikal . Akbal had laughed obligingly , but he had also recognized the larger message the jibe was intended to convey : that Tikal 's recent failure had repercussions far outside its own boundaries , in the form of trade agreements that could not be honored and aid that could not be extended . There was a great deal of bitterness over Caan Ac 's decision to withhold some of the maize he had promised from last season 's crop , and while Akbal had been tempted to disown the ruler 's actions , he had finally decided to absorb the complaints in silence . He was not here to proselytize , and there could be no useful purpose , and no kindness , in telling them of the success of his own clan 's late harvest . Even in the shade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he let his eyelids flutter shut , falling into a state between sleep and wakefulness , entranced by the buzzing din of the locusts . He thought of his stone , seeing its image clearly in his mind , blank and yellow beneath its shelter . Perhaps he would have time for it now , since he had obtained no work for himself here . But was it not too early to think about memorializing the clan ? When he had left Tikal , more land was being cleared for gardens , and new people were coming in to occupy and farm it . Balam Xoc had already spoken of holding a second adoption ceremony , possibly in conjunction with the Tun-End Ceremony , which was now only four months off . There was much work to be done , and many supplies that would still have to be obtained from outside the city . He should be thinking instead of where else he could take his crafts to trade for all the things the clan needed : obsidian , salt , hard stone for grinding maize , pottery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded back into thoughts of his stone , and then into memories of Zac Kuk , vivid and pleasurable and empty of frustration . He began to dream of the child she was carrying , the son or daughter they would one day pledge to the clan . . . he could see Zac Kuk with the baby in her arms , proudly holding it up for Balam Xoc 's blessing . Chan Mac appeared in the background , and Kinich , smiling with his jeweled teeth . Then Akbal was in the craft house , painting with Kal Cuc beside him , and they were both very excited by what he was painting , a bowl or a plate , the colors beautiful but the pattern indistinct , escaping his recognition because he was shaking with his excitement .. . He woke to find Chan Mac bending over him , a hand on his shoulder . He blinked and sighed , still feeling the emotions of his dream , and wishing he had seen the pattern he had been painting with such pleasure . Chan Mac straightened up and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the narrow bluff , where he stood gazing down into the valley . Sensing that he  | was not going to be indulged , Akbal roused himself and went over to the pool to splash water on his face . He approached Chan Mac respectfully , seeing the tension in his friend 's face and posture , as if all of his nerves had been pulled taut . There was a kind of angry resignation in his voice when he finally spoke . " What sort of use does your grandfather have for a diplomat ? " " I can think of many , " Akbal replied cautiously . " But what has happened ? Have you spoken to your father ? " " No . Nor have I been able to see the ruler . He is still meeting with Shield Jaguar and the other war leaders . " Chan Mac suddenly frowned deeply , slitting his eyes . " I had heard the reports in Tikal , but it is much worse than I had thought . Much worse . " " The Macaws ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form alliances with some of the tribes that used to look to us for protection , taking our lands by treaty rather than force . But they are only one of our problems now . There is another group of foreigners , people who call themselves the Putun . They have been coming in from the west in increasing numbers , raiding the settlements along the Lacandon River and threatening the cities that lie south of Yaxchilan . It is rumored that the ruler of Yaxche has made a secret pact with them , and is planning to help them wage war upon the neighboring cities . Trade with the highlands has already been disrupted , at a time when our stores are being drained to equip the warriors , and when no aid can be expected from Tikal . Caan Ac has promised to send us warriors , but nothing else . " " That is typical of his generosity , " Akbal remarked drily , but Chan Mac appeared not to hear him . " There is no place for diplomacy anymore , " he complained bitterly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our allies are showing little trust in one another . If the threat is close at hand , they insist that their own territory must be defended before all others . Yet if they feel their lands are secure , they want to be bribed to help anyone else . And there are still a few , like Shield Jaguar , who persist in seeing the danger as an opportunity for glory . There is no language they speak in common . " " So Grandfather was right , " Akbal said in a musing tone , not wishing to seem pleased . " Ektun is not immune . " Chan Mac cast a bleak glance at the warriors training in the valley below . " Ektun may be doomed . The locusts will eat our crops while our men die in fields far away , fields that grow only corpses . And if we fall , Yaxchilan and the other cities on the river will fall with us . After that , even Tikal will not be immune . " " Surely there is time to save ourselves , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Your grandfather has no followers here , " Chan Mac pointed out relentlessly . " He has few enough in Tikal , and the ruler for an enemy . That is not much cause for hope . " Akbal drew back from him slightly , resisting the pull of his despair . " We are not so alone , my friend . We act in the sight of the ancestors , and with their guidance . You will understand that better when you come to live with us. "  | " Perhaps , " Chan Mac said without conviction . " I doubt that my father will ever understand , or forgive my desertion . " " I will help in whatever way I can , " Akbal offered . " When will you speak to him ? " Chan Mac came as close as he would , on this day , to smiling . " I am sure you will be a great help , once I can convince them to forgive you . It may be a few more days . " " It is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , and then to leave , " Chan Mac said ruefully , nodding to himself , " taking one of us with you ... " KAL cue came back down the slope of the ravine as silently as possible , stepping carefully over roots and turning branches out of his way with the end of his blunt-tipped spear . He found Kinich Kakmoo and the other six men halfway down , crouched in a tight circle , each man facing outward defensively while he rested , as Kinich had taught them . Their soot-blackened faces were streaked with sweat , and they responded to the return of their scout with a mixture of relief and weary expectation . " The Lady Kanan Naab and the Serpent Clan priest are sitting together under the breadnut trees , " Kal Cuc reported to Kinich . " They are just at the edge of the clearing , to the right of the Serpent Stone . There is no one else nearby . " Kinich nodded with satisfaction and turned back to the other men , glancing around the circle to be sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Good . This will be your last exercise of the day , if you are successful . You must surround them without being seen or heard , close enough so that you can be at their throats before they can cry out or reach for a weapon . You are weary , so remember to lift your feet , and be aware of the shadows you cast . The hoot of the owl will be your signal to attack . Be careful with your weapons , and see that you do not injure them . " Kinich nodded to Kal Cuc , who led the men up the slope in single file , with Kinich following along at the end to observe . He knew that this was a cruel trick to play on his sister and Yaxal Can , but everyone had been warned about the training drills he was conducting , and his apprentice warriors needed the experience . If they could not take a woman and a priest by surprise , they would have little chance against the ruler 's assassins . Kanan Naab would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clan . The men spread out in a loose semicircle at the top of the slope , with those in the middle allowing the ends to advance before moving forward themselves . As the undergrowth thinned out and the light of the clearing appeared through the breadnut trees , the men got down on their hands and knees and crept from one place of concealment to the next , keeping sight of one another and advancing by +urns . Kinich trailed them at a short distance , listening for sounds and watching for movements that might have given them away , had the pair ahead truly been enemies . Ile heard his sister 's voice , then Yaxal 's response , deeper  | and more succinct , answering rather than asking . What do they talk about for so long ? Kinich wondered . He remembered his own courtship of May as an agonizing period of long looks and awkward silences , punctuated by the promptings of the inevitable chaperones . He did not understand his sister 's relationship with the priest at all , especially the fact that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told him not to interfere , and he had accepted the old woman 's warning , knowing that many things had changed while he had been away from the clan . Perhaps I am interfering now , Kinich thought guiltily , but it was too late to call off his men . They had crept to within a few feet of the unsuspecting couple , raising themselves up behind the boles of the trees , poised and ready for his signal . He could not deprive them of their capture now , however his sister might choose to interpret his intentions later . Cupping his hands around his lips , he let out a single , mournful hoot , and watched his men spring into action . One of them tripped over a root and went sprawling to the ground next to Yaxal , but Kal Cuc was between them in the same instant , his unsharpened spear pointed directly at the priest 's throat . The others hemmed the couple in on all sides , so swiftly that they could only gasp in surprise before the spears thrust in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinich was impressed . " Enough ! " he shouted as he emerged from hiding . " Release them , and apologize for the fright you have given them . " Kal Cuc and the others lowered their spears and grinned at one another , their teeth very white against their soot-darkened features . They stood up and backed away slightly , murmuring apologies that did not match the exultant expressions on their faces . Kanan Naab had a hand to her heart and was breathing deeply with her eyes closed , and when Kinich saw Yaxal 's tightlipped glare , he decided to deal with the men first . " One of you is dead , " he said to the man who had fallen . " But otherwise , you have earned your rest for today . Tomorrow you must run the course I showed you , with spears and shields . We will put Akbal 's stamina to the test when he returns . " The men laughed and departed with proud smiles on their faces , leaving Kinich to deal with the irate Yaxal Can , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Kinich went to help him , but stopped when the priest rose up to confront him . " Was that necessary ? " Yaxal demanded angrily , causing Kinich to straighten up in self-defense , planting the end of his spear on the ground in front of him . " Perhaps not necessary , " he said evenly , " but very useful to my men . I apologize for disturbing you , Yaxal . And you , my sister , " he added , stopping to look into Kanan Naab 's face . " You must frrgive me for making you the victims of our training . " Yaxal muttered something unintelligible and stalked off into the trees . Seeing the distress on Kanan Naab 's face , Kinich followed the priest with his eyes , watching him wade into the undergrowth and then stop , fumbling with his loincloth . Kinich smiled knowingly.  | " He will be back , " he said to Kanan Naab , squatting across from her with his hands wrapped around the shaft of his spear . " I am truly sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to come here at all . " " He did not need so rude a reminder , " Kanan Naab assured him , then sighed and shook herself . " Nor did I. You have trained them well . " Kinich bared his glittering teeth in a grin . " I can not wait to train Akbal . But it is not as if you made it difficult for us . Our enemies should only converse like the two of you , with an ear for no one else . " Kanan Naab darkened and lowered her eyes shyly , though she glanced up quickly when Yaxal returned to squat down beside her . He offered Kinich a sullen apology . " Forgive my anger , Kinich . I had forgotten that you were raising an army here . " " An army of defenders , " Kinich corrected . " I would not want to take the field against real warriors , but they will keep us from being harassed and threatened . " " Perhaps there will be no need for them soon , " Yaxal suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ac will celebrate the katun anniversary of his reign in two months . I have heard rumors that he is willing to make peace with the Jaguar Paw Clan , in return for Balam Xoc 's participation in the rites of the ruler . " " I have not heard these rumors , " Kinich admitted grudgingly , locking eyes with the priest . " There is no reason , though , why Grandfather should make peace with him . " " But the ruler has no reason to assume that Grandfather will not participate in his rites , " Kanan Naab interjected , looking from one to the other in an attempt to mediate . She drew a scowl of denial from Kinich . " He should , " the warrior insisted . " We should participate in nothing that legitimizes the rule of Caan Ac . " " Then you will only provoke him into sending his warriors against you , " Yaxal pointed out with equal stubbornness . " For which you say you are not prepared . " " We are prepared to resist a show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spear . " The warriors come from all of the clans , and they have never been used against their own people . They would be reluctant to make us the first , especially when they see , that we intend to fight . " Kanan Naab stood up with an abruptness that silenced both of them . " This argument has no meaning , except to the two of you , " she said in a scathing voice . " It is just as well that Balam Xoc will decide these matters for himself . He , at least , has no need to prove his dominance . " They rose almost in unison , holding out their hands in appeal , but Kanan Naab walked past them into the clearing and headed for her father 's house without looking back . Neither man could face the other for several moments , though neither wanted to be the first to depart . Kinich pounded the end of his spear into the ground , growling to himself in disgust . " This is all my fault , " he muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the courtesy to leave you in peace . " " I &hnuIrl; not have ansdM tint with rumnrx " YAxAl Accused himself . " Mv  | interest in seeing you make peace with the ruler is entirely selfish . I would like to visit here without fear of being reported to my superiors . " He glanced ruefully at Kinich . " Or of being attacked by your warriors . " Kinich looked at him and laughed softly , taking the jibe as a sign of forgiveness . " I will not victimize you again , " he promised . " But we have made my sister very angry with our arguing . She has never before spoken to me like that . " Yaxal briefly stared off in the direction Kanan Naab had gone , his face softening perceptibly . " She does not like the way men contend with one another for power , " he explained quietly . " She feels this from one of the other Close Ones , a man named Opna . He vies with her to be seen as the one closest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kinich objected instinctively . " He is a foreigner . " " He has been adopted . And your sister is a woman . " Kinich stopped short to consider the implications of that , his jaw moving wordlessly . He squinted at Yaxal with a curiosity he seemed reluctant to display . " My wife has told me that Kanan Naab has had a vision of her own . Surely my grandfather is aware of this . " " He is , " Yaxal allowed . " But he has never spoken to her about it , and she does not feel she can ask him to do so . I think she is also afraid that Opna would hear of it , and somehow use it against her . " " What do you know of this man ? " Kinich asked darkly , his reluctance overwhelmed by a surge of protective feeling . " Only his reputation . He was a prodigy as a boy , like your brother Akbal , only the skills of the priesthood are much more rare in a child . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was serving the ruler of that city before he was twenty . Then he became better known for the trances he obtained with the use of the sacred mushrooms , and began to develop a cult centered around himself . The high priest of Copan banned the cult before it became too powerful , and sent Opna into exile . " " So now he thinks to take over our clan ! " Kinich exploded angrily . " I will report this to the clan council , if Grandfather will not hear me himself ! " " You must not , " Yaxal urged him forcefully . " None of what I have told you is proof against his sincerity . Balam Xoc must know it himself , yet he allows Opna to serve him . No , Kanan Naab must resolve this for herself . She must not be made the subject of contention between men . " Kinich looked off into the distance , spinning the spear between his palms as he allowed his anger to settle . " Perhaps you are right . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with renewed respect . " No doubt she is fortunate to have you to advise her . " " I am familiar with the ambition of priests , at least , " Yaxal conceded modestly . " And your grandfather has given me permission to instruct her in the reading of the glyphs and the keeping of time . " " She is most fortunate , " Kinich mused , studying Yaxal 's face with a mixture of shrewdness and curiosity . " I have to wonder , though , if this is satisfying to you ? As you have said , she is a woman . Even a brother can not miss that . " " Nor have I , " Yaxal said frankly , meeting the warrior 's eyes . " But it is ; - , i o rastai.l .. In marry a /amour Paw wnmsn . Even if  | Kanan Naab were willing to leave your grandfather 's service , I could not ask her to be my wife . " " Why do you not join us , then ? " The priest gazed out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question hang in the air between them . " I have considered it many times , " he said at last . " But then I think of the years I spent as a clan priest , and the years after that , earning my place within the Tun Count priests . Was it easy for you to surrender your rank among the ruler 's warriors ? " " Caan Ac made it so . " " No doubt , but he has not done the same to me . I feel useful in my work , and yes , important . And I have a mother and two unmarried sisters who depend upon me for support , and relatives who expect me to fulfill my obligations to the clan . I can not even tell them of my visits here . " Kinich held up his palms in a gesture of sympathy and understanding . " Forgive me , Yaxal . I would not ask you to act against your own judgment . Yet . . . I no longer believe that people are drawn to us by accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he came to me in the jungle , and led me home . " " Ah , " Yaxal exclaimed softly , raising his eyebrows at the revelation , which had come forth spontaneously , in exchange for Yaxal 's own candidness . The two men seemed to realize simultaneously how much they had revealed to one another , and how quickly they had passed from contention to intimacy . They both fell silent , as if reconsidering the trust they had placed in the other . " I must wash this soot from my face , " Kinich said abruptly . " Kanan Naab must be waiting to finish the conversation I interrupted so rudely . " " I must bid her farewell , at least , " Yaxal averred . " I will speak to you again , another time . And I will watch this man Opna . Quietly . " " That would be wise , " Yaxal said , and they bowed to each other , leaving the grove by separate paths . Ektun AH KIN TZAB was dying . Akbal had ascertained that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest 's chamber , and watching the faces of those who were allowed in to see him . It was another day and a half before he realized that he was not going to be granted an audience with the high priest . The priests guarding the curtained doorway remembered who he was , and they had responded politely to his repeated requests to be admitted . But they had also been firm in their sense of duty to their ailing master , and they had gradually made it clear to Akbal that a painter from Tikal was not going to he given any priority at a time like this , especially when they did not know the nature of his relationship with the high priest . The only person who might have interceded for him was Ah Kin Tzab himself , but he was being protected from the exertion of such decisions . This final dixannointment was the most difficult for Akbal to hear and it  | began to erode the equanimity with which he had borne all the others . It seemed that the chain of circumstances that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to its people , had begun to fragment and fall into pieces that had no meaning or significance . He would leave here more of a stranger than when he arrived , having been denied the chance to renew and solidify any of his relationships . Now he would never say to Ah Kin Tzab , " Yes , my grandfather is a holy man , " and tell him of the prophecies that had come true and the projects that had been carried out . Nor would he ever be able to express his pride in Zac Kuk 's adaptation to the Jaguar Paw Clan , and his happiness with their marriage . These were the gifts he had brought for the high priest , and for Batz Mac and Muan Kal as well , but they had begun to go sour from neglect . He had even begun to lose his faith in Chan Mac , who was supposedly still negotiating a meeting with his parents . Given his friend 's diplomatic skills , Akbal found it hard to believe that he had not yet reached an accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own behalf . No one will face me , he thought furiously , and began to contemplate simply leaving his gifts outside Batz Mac 's house and taking his porters back to Tikal without farewell . He had been patient , but even his youth did no , compel him to accept a disrespect he had not earned . As his resentment festered and grew , he kept more and more to himself and avoided all contact with the members of Chan Mac 's family , even to the point of missing meals . He had no appetite , anyway , and no reason to worry about keeping up his strength . He became listless and irritable , sleeping frequently but not well . Yet when he was able to fall into a sound sleep , he dreamed vividly , and one night he again found himself painting in his dream . This time , however , he could see what he was painting , and it made him marvel at his own boldness . It also made him understand the excitement he was feeling , so well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the middle of the night , but he rose and lit a torch for himself , and began to make charcoal sketches on a piece of leather . His renderings seemed crude at first , compared with the startling clarity of the image in his mind , but his hand gradually became more sure as he shed the initial urgency of his excitement . Then he applied himself to the ritual of cutting his brushes and preparing his paints , letting the familiar procedures calm him still further . By the time the sun had begun to redden the eastern sky , everything was in readiness , and he could wait no longer to begin . Taking a bag of trade goods with him , he headed for the house of Ektun 's best potter , where he could be certain of obtaining the ceremonial plate he needed , one worthy of both his dream and the tomb of Ah Kin Tzab . CHAN MAC announced himself outside the doorway , then sent the servant with the tray of food in ahead of him at Akbal 's , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his paints and brushes spread out around him and a painted tripod plate on the mat in front of him . Chan Mac squatted down across from him and gestured toward the tray the servant had left . " You must he hungry . It has been two days since you have eaten with us . " " I have been nourished by my task . " Akbal said in a tired voice . not even  | bothering to look at the tray . But his nose betrayed him , and he soon turned aside to examine the maize cakes and the steaming bowl of bean stew , and then began to eat with real concentration . He paused once , however , and after carefully wiping his fingers on the cloth beside him , he turned the ceremonial plate on its base so that Chan Mac could see what he had painted on it . Then he went back to filling his mouth with food , washing it down with sips of whipped cacao . The plate was round and a deep orange in color , its gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the center of the basin was a single figure , outlined in black : a man , dressed in a spotted headdress and leggings , his arms cocked at his sides and his legs apart , rising up on one foot , as if arrested in midmotion . Dancing , Chan Mac realized with a start of recognition . The man 's face and loincloth had been painted a dark red and his chest striped with black ; he was flanked on each side by a delicately rendered water lily , the blossom trailing a long , curving tendril that seemed to enhance the figure 's illusion of motion . " It is most unusual , " Chan Mac ventured , unable to form a more positive judgment . " As always , the brushwork is superb . But . . . I have never seen a figure of any kind painted on a ceremonial plate . Nor was I aware that such a custom existed in Tikal . " " It does not , " Akbal said succinctly , wiping his lips with a cloth . " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the plate a second time but still found the image jarring to his eye , a departure from tradition too great to be easily assimilated . He was accustomed to simple designs that featured muan feathers or cloud scrolls , or spiraling patterns of jade beads  --  images that were fixed and reassuring in their symmetry , like the rituals in which the plates were used . The dancing man , in contrast , provoked a feeling of agitation in him , a sense of unnameable risk . " It is your grandfather , of course , " Chan Mac suggested in a neutral tone , trying to draw Akbal out . " As he was on the night of your clan 's feast . " " The Jaguar Protector , " Akbal murmured reverently , glancing down at the plate . " It will be his gift , and mine , to Ah Kin Tzab . I wanted you to see it before I took it to him . " " I am flattered , and impressed by your skill . But again , I must point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that Ah Kin Tzab will accept it ? " Akbal shrugged and spread his hands over the plate , as if it were its own explanation . " He wanted to know about my grandfather , and I have given him the truth . He can choose to refuse it , but he will not turn it away unseen , as I have been turned away . He will know what I have come to tell him . " Chan Mac squinted at him narrowly , perturbed by the uncompromising arrogance of his reply . " You speak boldly of the truth , my friend , especially when you find its source in dreams . One would think that you were the holy man . " " I have made no such claim , " Akbal said curtly . " But Balam Xoc has taught us all to he alert to signs , and to trust the truths that are shown to us . That is what he asks of you , as well . " " He has spoken to me himself , " Chan Mac replied with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . " I will let you go to the high priest , then . I came to tell you that I have persuaded my parents to eat with you tonight , if you still wish to speak to them . " " I do , " Akbal concurred , rising to his knees and reaching for a blanket in which to wrap the plate . He paused to catch Chan Mac 's eye before covering the dancing figure completely . " I did not show you this simply to impress you . I wanted to remind you of the spirit that guides our lives , here as in Tikal . " " I have not forgotten , " Chan Mac assured him gruffly , gesturing for him to finish the wrapping . " I have seen too much to forget . I will tell my parents to expect you . See that you do not forget . " THE HIGH PRIEST sat bundled in blankets against the wall , with a single torch set in a holder above him . His eyes were so deeply sunken into their sockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or closed , giving his shadowed , fleshless face the appearance of a skeletal mask . The priest sitting next to him was blowing smoke into his face , drawing intermittently upon a long cigar that gave off a peculiarly musty odor . The priest conducting Akbal had him sit in the smoker 's place , and take the cigar into his own hands . " The smoke revives his spirit , " the priest explained in a low voice . " But be wary of how much you breathe in yourself . It is powerful mai . " Akbal 's plate lay exposed upon its blanket next to Ah Kin Tzab , whose eyes , he could now see , were firmly closed . The priests left , and Akbal took a cautious puff on the cigar and gently blew a cloud of smoke over the old man , trying not to inhale any himself . The smoke made his tongue tingle and left an earthy , bitter taste in his mouth , a taste he did not associate with mai . He blew another cloud at Ah Kin Tzab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasurable numbness spread upward from the base of his skull . This is not only mai , he decided uneasily , and set the smoldering cigar on the wooden rack in front of him . Ah Kin Tzab 's eyelids fluttered open a few moments later , but only long enough for him to locate the cigar and nod toward it . " More , " he said in a weak , sibilant whisper , and Akbal forced himself to comply , feeling the small amounts he inhaled go straight to his head . It made him slightly dizzy , but it also seemed to have made the room grow lighter , so that the colors of his plate and the designs on Ah Kin Tzab 's blankets suddenly struck his eye with heightened force . He did not realize that he was staring at the blankets until the old man spoke again , his eyes open and attentive . " That is enough . It will help you hear me better , as well . " Akbal shook himself and returned the cigar to the rack , noting that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions , however , seemed agonizingly slow , so that it took him a long time to bring his eyes back up to Ah Kin Tzab 's emaciated face . The old man made a barely perceptible nod in the direction of the plate . " The style is very old . Yet the paint is new . " " I painted it first in a dream , " Akbal said , finding that his voice seemed disembodied , itself dreamlike . He was not surprised , though , that the style was not original to him . It had felt like remembering when he was painting .  | " The dancer has no feathers , " the high priest continued . " That is also new . Or perhaps very , very old . " " They are the same to Balam Xoc . He is a holy man , my lord . I have no doubt of that now . " Ah Kin Tzab leaned his head back against the wall , his eyes hooding with fatigue . " You have shown me that , " he whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That will not be long , Akbal . I can feel the coldness of the Underworld all around me . " Akbal shivered slightly and bowed his head in respect . His dizziness had passed , leaving his thoughts still slowed but very lucid . He realized that all the other things he had wanted to tell Ah Kin Tzab were unimportant now . He needed to listen , not speak . This was a voice he would hear no more , except in memory . " Tell Balam Xoc that I am grateful , " the old man said at last . " Tell him that I leave the world with an uneasy heart , knowing that there are too few like him who remain behind : men who emulate the ancestors in every aspect of their lives , not merely in the making of war . " " I will tell him , my lord , " Akbal promised , and Ah Kin Tzab nodded , the thin line of his lips stretching in what might have been a smile . " Farewell , then , Akbal Balam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must paint the dreams of your people , before they vanish from the earth . You must carve your stone , so that the memory of your wisdom and greatness is not lost . " He paused for breath , looking at Akbal for the last time . " You have my blessing . Go now , and attend to the world while you can . I must attend to my dying ... " " PAINTER . " Akbal straightened up where he stood , blinking dazedly in the harsh glare reflecting off the plastered surfaces of the plaza and its surrounding buildings . He was still heavily under the influence of the mai he had smoked , so that he was not certain where the voice had come from , or if it had been directed at him . It might even have been an echo of his own thoughts , which were still resonating with the parting words of Ah Kin Tzab . Shielding his eyes with his hand , he turned slowly in a circle , and suddenly found himself face to face with Shield Jaguar . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headdress of blue and green feathers . His broad chest was completely covered by a plated pectoral of glittering green jade , and there were bands of round jade beads around his wrists and waist . An ancestral effigy head hung from the thickly embroidered apron of his loincloth , and his feet were encased in leather sandals with anklets of jaguar skin . " My lord , " Akhal mumbled belatedly , too overwhelmed by the vividness of the man 's presence to manage a proper bow . Shield Jaguar laughed loudly , showing the filed points of his teeth . His retainers stood behind him in a large group , though Akhal had no attention to spare for them . " Why bother to bow to me ? " the ruler inquired sarcastically . " You do not bow to Caan Ac anymore , do you ? Yes , and by all means stare into my face ,  | Painter . I am accustomed to your boldness . Come , tell me what you see there ... " Akbal knew that he was being mocked , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it . In his sensitized state , he saw every feature of the man 's face with the utmost clarity : the great beak of a nose that seemed to snap at the air in front of him ; the bright black eyes , circled now with webs of tiny lines ; the jagged furrow of a recent scar that creased one cheek . There was the same aggressive curl to his thick lips , a hint of the snarl that lay just below the surface , waiting to be unleashed . Yet the face had aged in a way the eyes had not ; it was a mask that had hardened and set , no longer moving so readily to the impulse of the spirit within . Akbal had seen such a face before , the face of an endurance reluctantly learned . " I see the jungle , my lord , " he said quietly . " As I see it now in my brother 's face . " The ruler recoiled slightly , his geniality gone . " Perhaps you have too honest an eye , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put his hands on his hips and expanded his chest , rippling the gleaming plates of jade . " Has Kinich Kakmoo retired , then ? Does he sit around the fire with the women ? " " He is the nacom of our clan . He sees to our defense . " " Defense ! " Shield Jaguar snorted scornfully . " Your defiance , you mean . I have heard about this would-be holy man , and the outrageous way he has acted toward Caan Ac . I am amazed that he is tolerated , even by Caan Ac . Rest assured , Painter , that I would have crushed your clan long ago . " Akbal could only nod in agreement , seeing how thoroughly he believed his own threat , and how much pleasure he took in uttering it . He was a man who attended best to the dying of others . " But tell Kinich Kakmoo , " the ruler went on , " that when he finally tires of defending the clan cookhouse , there is warrior 's work waiting for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known the kind of fame I can give him , or the rewards . He could have a clan  --  a village  --  of his own , if he wished it . " " He has a clan of his own , my lord , " Akbal said mildly . " But I will tell him of your offer . " Shield Jaguar looked at him sharply , perhaps sensing his disbelief , or perhaps merely anticipating it . The mask of magnanimity fit him poorly , and Akbal discreetly averted his too-honest eyes . " See that you do , " the ruler said curtly . " Why are you here , anyway ? " " I have relatives here , and I have been to see Ah Kin Tzab . " " What business do you have with the high priest ? " Shield Jaguar demanded rudely , oblivious of the fact that this was not his city , nor Akbal his subject . Akbal stared at him for a moment , knowing that a straight refusal to answer would be proper , but not wise . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . " And I brought him the regards of my grandfather Balam Xoc , the holy man of whom you spoke . " " The Featherless Dancer , " Shield Jaguar muttered , but his eyes were suddenly uneasy behind the mask of contempt . He scowled and looked out over the plaza , as if to distance himself from what he had just heard . Then he seemed to lose interest in the conversation altogether , and made an abrupt gesture of dismissal .  | " Go back to Tikal , then , " he snapped . " We need warriors here , not painters or holy men . " This time Akbal had the presence of mind to bow , touching a hand to his shoulder and keeping his head lowered as the ruler and his retinue swept past . When he finally straightened up , he was alone , and suddenly aware of the hot sunlight beating down upon him . He felt parched and enervated , his hands shaking slightly as the stimulating effect of the mai wore off . He started walking toward Chan Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the pool on the hill where Zac Kuk had taken him . He would go there , he decided , after he had notified the porters that they would be leaving for Tikal in the morning . There was no point in delaying another day , even if Batz Mac and Muan Kal could not be won over in one night . He had looked upon death today  --  twice  --  and the experience had awakened a sense of urgency that he had never known before . " Attend to the world while you can , " Ah Kin Tzab had said , and Akbal had heard him precisely . He no longer had the time to be a suitor , and to wait . So he would see to the porters first . Then he could go to the pool , and to the other parts of the city he wished to see for one last time . Then he could indulge himself in paying a proper farewell to Ektun , knowing that he would be leaving for good . THE PORTERS , with their packs beside them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtyard , out of the light rain that was shredding the mist that hung in drooping veils over the thatched peaks of the houses . Wrapped in a blanket against the dampness , Chan Mac stood next to Akbal beneath the fig tree that had once been a perch for Chuen and Zac Kuk 's birds . Neither of his parents had come out to see their guest off , and Akbal showed no sign of expecting them as he busied himself with the knots and straps on his own pack . He looked up at Chan Mac with a face as drawn and haggard as Chan Mac felt , for they had both been up for most of the night . His eyes , though , were alert enough , enlivened by the responsibilities of the journey ahead . " I was rude last night , " he said in a slightly hoarse voice . " Especially to your mother . " It was not a question , nor really a confession of guilt . More an acknowledgment of something that could not have been avoided . " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forceful , at times , than perhaps was necessary . But you did not fail to command their attention . They must have wondered , as I did , what had become of the reticent young man I brought here only two years ago . " " They know at least that I am not deceitful , " Akbal said drily , refusing to be flattered . " Now they must think I am merely deluded , a fanatic like my grandfather . " Chan Mac gave a disingenuous shrug , unwilling to admit how accurately he had read their reactions . They were not accustomed to so much earnest talk about visions and signs and dreams , and memories in the blood . And surely they had been skeptical of the powers Akbal attributed to Balam Xoc , and of  | Akbal had made them listen , and he seemed as unaffected by their judgment now as he had seemed then . " I regret , though , " Akbal added , standing up to face him , " that I was so little help to you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured him , " even if he resists his own knowledge . He knows that all of our lives will soon be changed . My mother , though , still clings to what she wishes were true . She can not believe that the rulers of our cities  --  especially those related to her by blood ? would act against the interests of their own people . " Akbal shook his head in exasperation and reached down to lift his pack from the ground . He slipped his arms through the shoulder straps and bent at the waist so that Chan Mac could help him fit the band of his tumpline around the top of his head . " I am young , I know , " he said in a taut voice , his neck arched against the weight on his back . " But I no longer have any patience with those who refuse to see what is available to any eye . The masks have all been broken , ' as my grandfather said . " " Be patient at least with me , " Chan Mac requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my return , and inform him of my decision . Then I will come to join you . " " I will await that day with pleasure , " Akbal said , and laid a hand on his forearm in farewell . Then he looked around the courtyard , and across the plaza at the curtained doorways of Batz Mac 's house , as if to say farewell to those he could not see . Nodding once more to Chan Mac , he lowered his head beneath the tumpline and led his porters out into the softly falling rain . Uaxactun THE RULER 'S representative had explained the purpose of his visit with admirable efficiency , but then , perhaps goaded by Pacal 's apparent indifference , he had felt compelled to launch into an elaborate description of the feasts and ceremonies being planned to celebrate the completion of Caan Ac 's first katun of rule . Pacal had already begun to drift off into his own thoughts when he heard muted exclamations of surprise from the next room , where Ixchel and his sister , Pom Ix , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with its familiarity , until he suddenly realized that it belonged to his son . What was Akbal doing here ? he wondered , straining to overhear the greetings being exchanged . But this only made the representative 's recital impossible to ignore , so that it became actively annoying . " I have heard enough , " Pacal said abruptly , and the man blinked at him in surprise , his voice trailing off in midspeech . " Tell me again what the ruler is willing to offer in exchange for my father 's participation . " " He is willing to lift the official ban on trade within the city , " the man repeated dutifully , " and to allow the members of the Jaguar Paw Clan free movement throughout Tikal . There can be no declaration of amnesty , however , and he will not take back those he has released from his service . Except '  --  - - IC , . r , ..... .  | " Of course . Tell him , then , that I will return to Tikal tomorrow . But remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he chooses to grant me himself . " The representative nodded with a reluctance all too plain to Pacal , who guessed that his warning would probably not be conveyed . Caan Ac was not a man who happily received doubtful news . " The ruler and the high priest are also concerned that Balam Xoc wear the full regalia of the Night Sun Jaguar in the rites . " The man paused to swallow . " They refer , of course , to the feathers . " Pacal gave a short , mirthless laugh . " I do not think he will barter that , if he barters at all . " " You do not seem to share the ruler 's concern about these matters , " the representative suggested darkly , but Pacal simply gestured dismissively with the flat of his hand . " I have confined my concern to Uaxactun , as the ruler ordered . You have heard my response ; take it to him . " The representative left with only a desultory bow , creating a sudden silence in the next room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow him , pushing through the curtain to find Akbal squatting beside Ixchel and Pom Ix , gazing up at the doorway expectantly . For a moment , Pacal could not find his voice , struck by the realization of how long it had been since he and his son had spoken . He saw Ixchel looking at him anxiously , obviously afraid that they would argue again . " Greetings , my son , " Pacal said at last , and Akbal rose to bow to him , crossing both his arms on his chest . Pacal felt a thrill of gratification so strong that it annoyed him , making him conscious of how much he desired his son 's forgiveness . He frowned thoughtfully to disguise his urge to smile . " What has brought you to Uaxactun ? " " I am returning from Ektun , " Akbal told him . " I thought it would be proper to call upon you while I was here . " " It is , indeed . But you say you have been to Ektun . Obviously , the ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Akbal hesitated , betraying a certain wariness about revealing clan secrets . But Pacal could see that he wanted to trust him , even though he was not certain he should . " The success of our gardens has allowed us to be generous with our neighbors , " Akbal explained , choosing his words carefully . " They , in turn , allow us to use the smaller trails that pass their houses , so that we can avoid the places that are watched . " " I see , " Pacal said , then glanced at Ixchel . " We are going back to Tikal ourselves , tomorrow . The ruler has sent for me . " Ixchel immediately jumped to her feet , unable to conceal her pleasure even as she bowed to her husband and Akbal and apologized for interrupting . " Forgive me , but I must alert the servants to begin packing . " Porn Ix also rose and accompanied her from the room , smiling at Ixchel 's excitement with a sister-in-law 's fond tolerance . Pacal saw , though , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to he regretting his frankness  | " Perhaps , my son , " Pacal suggested , " we will have the honor of your company on tomorrow 's journey . " Akbal examined him doubtfully . " I have porters with me , and valuable goods . I had planned to enter the city under the cover of darkness . " " There is no need for that now , " Pacal informed him confidently . " Caan Ac has asked me to return in order to negotiate with your grandfather . He wants Balam Xoc to participate in the rites of his katun anniversary , and he would not risk offending him by harming you or your men . He has already authorized me to offer the clan freedom of movement throughout Tikal . " " Then the honor will be mine , " Akbal replied , seeming suitably impressed by what he had been told . He is still not certain where my loyalties lie , Pacal reflected ruefully , feeling Akbal 's tentativeness as he led his son outside and across the plaza in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tikal embassy were part of a larger complex that occupied a flat ridge at the northern end of Uaxactun . The city itself was composed of eight such groups , all occupying ridges or flat-topped hills , and all connected with one another by causeways or paved roads . The thatched-roof houses of the people spread out from this central administrative and ceremonial center in all directions , sharing the high ground with the ubiquitous groves of breadnut trees . From the place where Pacal took them , standing on a cliff above an abandoned limestone quarry , most of the city 's temples and plazas and palaces lay open to their view to the south and west . Uaxactun was much smaller than Tikal , but it was equally venerable in both age and prestige , and Pacal noticed Akbal 's open admiration as he studied the painted and stuccoed roof combs that topped the many shrines . Then Akbal lifted his gaze and stared off into the far distance , and Pacal did likewise , knowing the sight his son was seeking . There it was , the shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible above even the tallest trees , at a distance that took half a day to walk . Its tall roof comb seemed like a red hand held up against the sky , commanding all who saw it to be humble and attentive . " Cauac Caan 's Headdress , ' " Pacal said softly . " That is what the common people of Uaxactun call it . It reminds them that they live in the shadow of Tikal and its ruler . " " There is the same feeling in Ektun , " Akbal said , looking at him searchingly . " There it is resented . " " Here , too , " Pacal admitted freely . " Caan Ac will have to look elsewhere for workmen this season . No one in Uaxactun will accept his promises anymore . " " Yet he has promised to send warriors to Ektun . " " No doubt . He yearns to be remembered like his father . He would have his deeds be his headdress . " " Even if others must suffer and die for them ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Pacal prompted , when Akbal appeared reluctant to go on . Obviously struggling with himself , the young man raised his hands in front of him , palms up , as if to pull the proper words out of the air . " Before I left Ektun , " he explained in a tight voice , " I was able to speak  | to Batz Mac and Muan Kal . They had been unwilling to receive me for most of my visit , because they felt I had deceived them about the status of my family . To Muan Kal , this included the fact that you were in disgrace , and no longer a steward . I had come prepared to defend Grandfather , and myself , but I had not thought that I would be defending you , as well . " Akbal drew a sharp breath . " But I did , and I found that it came easily to me . " " Indeed , " Pacal murmured in surprise , uncertain of what was showing on his face . " Indeed , " Akbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not you who failed to bring the rains . Everyone in Tikal knows that , even those who have been confined . Now Muan Kal knows it , too . " " You seem angry , my son . " " Yes ! I am angry that this man uses you to hide his own failings , and even more angry that you have allowed yourself to be used . But what I truly can not understand , and can not defend , is why you continue to serve him , now that you know what he is ! " Pacal looked down at the bleached rocks of the quarry below , waiting for Akbal to regain his composure . He was actually heartened by his son 's anger , and by the caring it implied . He was seldom capable , anymore , of feeling anger on his own behalf , or of caring how he was used . " I can only tell you , " he said to Akbal , " that I do not serve him out of choice , or respect . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expression clearly hopeful . But Pacal could not bring himself to admit that he was being held hostage , even though he knew it would win his son 's sympathy . It seemed demeaning , an admission of impotence rather than courage . " Kinich is with us now , " Akbal said suggestively . " We can defend ourselves against the ruler 's assassins . " " Could Kinich stop a fire , " Pacal retorted , " if the wind were blowing against him ? " Akbal hesitated , his eyes blinking rapidly . " But . . . you said that the ruler would not dare to harm us now , because of his rites . " " Not now , " Pacal stressed . " Once they are completed , though , he would be himself again . And he would repay me for my desertion , I assure you of that . The clan does not need me , Akbal , and I can do them no harm where I am . Perhaps I can even be of some help . " Akbal stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuttal , or perhaps an accusation . Will he tell me now that I am old and defeated ? Pacal wondered . Will he force me to admit that I have no hope of redemption , and no strength to try ? Akbal looked away instead , out over Uaxactun . " You must attend to the world as you see fit , " he said finally . " But at least come and live among us again . See for yourself how you are needed .
