Despite a powerful rally in the dollar for most of last week , corporate finance officials are still singing the blues for the U.S. currency . Multinational companies say the dollar ' s recent rebound resulted almost solely from market intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks . On Friday , for instance , the dollar declined as the U.S. stock market plunged and central banks were largely absent from the foreign exchange market . Meanwhile , corporate officials note , there has been little change in the economic pressures that have caused the dollar to plunge about 50% against the West German mark and Japanese yen since early 1985 . As a result , some of them regard further dollar declines as inevitable . " In my planning , I ' m expecting the long-term dollar weakness to continue , " Hans G. Storr , senior vice president and chief financial officer at Philip Morris Cos . , New York , says . " We ' re not traders . We ' re industrialists . We ' re looking at long-term trends . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the yen and 6% recovery against the mark in the first few days of 1988 didn ' t prompt companies to alter plans that were based on the assumption of a falling dollar . David C. Munro , senior economic forecaster at General Motors Corp. , calls the rebound " a blip . " He says , " By most analyses , the bulk of fundamentals point to a good deal of dollar depreciation continuing in 1988 . " He and other corporate officials say a clear turnaround in the huge U.S. trade and budget deficits will be needed for any dollar rebound to stick . If these large corporations were to change their views , the dollar could soar in a sensational rally , currency dealers say . Direct corporate transactions account for only about 10% of the more than $250 billion a day of trading in foreign exchange markets world-wide . But bank dealers and currency speculators often base their own trading positions on what they see the multinationals doing . U.S. companies with operations in Europe or elsewhere abroad " have a lot of money to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and head of corporate foreign exchange at Chemical Bank , New York , says . " When that happens , the dollar will get quite a boost . " Currency dealers , however , expect multinational industrial companies to be among the last to change their views and join in any dollar rally . " Corporations aren ' t that fast on the trigger . They have to have committee meetings and discuss it with the CEO , " a corporate foreign exchange adviser at a major New York bank says . " Their view is like a ship ; you don ' t turn a ship around in a minute . " A spokesman for Volkswagen of America Inc. in Troy , Mich. , says " it ' s too early " for the car importer to make adjustments based on a strengthening dollar . A stronger dollar could help VW price its West German-built vehicles more competitively in the U.S. But the company says it isn ' t about to consider price changes yet . " It ' s a very , very short-lived rally for us . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman says . Many corporate treasury officers view the dollar ' s early 1988 rebound as suspect and as engineered by massive central bank intervention . Eventually , the downward pressure of economic factors will overwhelm efforts by central banks to sustain the dollar ' s recovery , company officials say . " The turn ( upward ) since the holidays has central bank intervention as a mainspring behind it , and that ' s a mainspring that winds down . They don ' t have limitless resources , " Mr. Munro of GM says . With large U.S. trade and budget deficits still looming , he says , " There ' s no plausible scenario that gives you a ( lasting ) dollar rebound " in 1988 . Likewise , planners at Philip Morris are " sticking with the fundamentals " and a long-term view calling for further dollar declines , Mr. Storr says . Philip Morris , a tobacco and food company that generates about $7. 5 billion a year of revenue abroad , or about 30% of its total , doesn ' t hedge its receivables in strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company has been building up assets in such currencies as the yen  --  in which it receives around $50 million of revenue a month  --  as well as the mark , Swiss franc , Dutch guilder and Italian lira . In effect , Philip Morris is waiting to see whether its holdings in those currencies appreciate , rather than locking in current exchange rates by converting the holdings to dollars or buying dollars for future delivery against its foreign receivables . The company also is reducing its liabilities in strong foreign currencies . When the dollar was rising in 1984 and early 1985 , Philip Morris and many other companies carried out huge foreign-currency financings , planning to pay the debt later with stronger dollars . But when the dollar ' s value declines , it takes more dollars to repay foreign-denominated borrowings . In the past three years , Philip Morris has cut its foreign-denominated debt 80% , to $300 million from its 1985 peak of $1. 5 billion . The perception of a chronically weak dollar has figured in some long-range plans that aren ' t likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally . Philip Morris , for example , is increasingly focusing on European and Asian markets , where earnings are believed to be safe from currency translation losses and may offer potential for foreign-exchange gains . " It ' s dangerous to invest in a country with an unstable currency . As an investment base it ' s very , very dangerous , " Mr. Storr says . " We ' ve de-emphasized our business in America because of the currency . " GM also is sticking with its plan to export some Chevrolets to Japan  --  a feat made possible partly by a weak dollar . When the dollar was strong and the yen weak , " The Japanese could price very competitively with U.S. cars . Now the shoe is on the other foot , " Mr. Munro says . Plans to move some parts production to the U.S. from abroad as a result of the dollar ' s decline also remain on line at GM . The dollar ' s rally has spurred some corporate adjustments , but officials describe them as fine-tuning . The foreign-exchange manager at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from overseas says the company began last week to hedge against the possibility that major foreign currencies will weaken significantly this year . She says it bought options to sell foreign currencies and buy dollars at last week ' s levels . " We don ' t think the dollar will turn around , but we do want protection from a disaster , " the foreign exchange manager says , expressing the fear shared by other U.S. exporters that a sustained dollar rebound would hurt foreign sales . " We hope we never have to use the options . " Her current forecast calls for the dollar to drop at least another 20% to 100 yen and more than 10% to 1. 45 marks . " And if the trade deficit is still bad , the dollar ' s going to have to go lower , " she says . ( See : " Corrections &; Amplifications : Philip Morris Cos.
