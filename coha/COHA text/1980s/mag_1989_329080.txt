Philip Corboy does n't need to chase ambulances . They seem to chase him . Just one day after the July 19 crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in Sioux City , Iowa , the white-thatched , patrician-looking Chicago attorney was asked for legal help by the family of one of the survivors . Within 24 hours , Corboy had filed the first lawsuit to come out of the disaster . Since then , he has received calls from twelve other people involved in the crash . His fee , if he wins : as much as one-third of the damages . <P> Corboy 's lawsuit was the first volley in what promises to be a high-stakes legal battle over the Iowa crash . Some attorneys have even taken to calling the tragedy " Sue City " because of the huge number of lawsuits that are expected to follow . While the 185 survivors and the next of kin of the 111 who were killed are the ultimate beneficiaries , the struggle will take place between a small cadre of plaintiffs ' lawyers and their counterparts , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That kind of tug-of-war has grown increasingly fierce over the past few decades . <P> Iowa bar officials arrived at the scene of the Sioux City crash nearly as fast as the doctors did . They were determined to head off a well-known postcrash problem : unscrupulous lawyers soliciting clients on the scene in violation of ethics codes . Representatives of the state bar set up an office at the health center where many of the survivors had been taken for treatment . Bar officials also placed an ad in the Sioux City Journal asking people to call if they knew of any unethical contacts by attorneys . None were reported . <P> Other crash scenes have been more ghoulish . After 137 people died in the Aug. 2 , 1985 , crash of a Delta L-1011 at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport , legions of lawyers sought business amid the chaos , scurrying among emergency- relief workers and hospital aides . They even tramped through the halls of Parkland Memorial Hospital handing out name cards to the families of the deceased . Top lawyers in the field , who get their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have utter contempt for those who choose to get cases this way . They deserve the bad reputation they have , " says Lee Kreindler , a New York City lawyer who won a record $7.9 million judgment in the Delta case . <P> Insurers show up just as quickly as the lawyers , seeking through a disputed process known as claim control to keep costs from spiraling . Associated Aviation Underwriters , one of the major airline-liability insurance companies , has already begun the process of talking with survivors and the families of victims of the Sioux City crash , trying to settle their claims quickly and dissuade them from going to court . Says Peter Magee , executive vice president of the company : " If you buy a ticket to get from Point A to Point B , and you do n't make it there , then the legal burden is on me to explain why . Statistics show you 're going to recover something . It is n't a question of Is compensation fair ? It 's a question of how much . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
