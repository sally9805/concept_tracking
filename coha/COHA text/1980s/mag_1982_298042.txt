An experienced team player replaces a battle-weary vicar <P> " With great regret , I have accepted the resignation of Secretary of State Al Haig . " <P> - President Reagan at the White House <P> " We agreed that consistency , clarity and steadiness of purpose were essential , but in recent months it has become clear to me that the foreign policy on which we embarked together was shifting from that careful course . " <P> <P> - Haig , reading his letter of resignation at the State Department <P> It was a strange event , at once inevitable and shockingly abrupt . Alexander Meigs Haig , 57 , had been out of tune with much of the rest of the Reagan Administration from the day he took office 17 months ago as the self-proclaimed " vicar " of American foreign policy . He had been worn down by incessant friction with colleagues-much of it self-created-in the unending battle for the President 's ear , and he had said he would quit so many times that the threat of resignation had become a Washington joke . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friction and was fully pre pared to let Haig go . Yet , until the very moment that an obviously strained and tense Reagan stepped before the TV cameras to make his terse ( 1 min. 11 sec. ) announcement of Haig 's resignation , there had been no hint that the President had not only agreed to his departure but had already chosen a successor . The nation , the world and even members of the National Security Council who had attended a luncheon meeting with Reagan and Haig that broke up only 1 hr. 45 min. before the President 's announcement , reacted with stunned surprise . <P> The amazement was tinged with apprehension too . Not , to be sure , because of any misgivings about the ability of the man that Reagan chose as Haig 's replacement . As Secretary of the Treasury and economic-policy coordinator in the Nixon Administration , George Pratt Shultz , 61 , earned a reputation as a team player who could win cooperation from officials with strongly divergent views ; he might be able to avoid the bureaucratic battles that gave Haig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadiness of purpose " to American foreign policy . Though Shultz has no formal diplomatic background , his negotiations with foreign leaders on trade and monetary matters during the Nixon Administration and his experience during the past eight years as a key executive of Bechtel , an engineering and construction firm with operations in more than 20 countries , have made him thoroughly familiar with the world outside the U.S. With the very notable exception of Israeli leaders and their more fervent American supporters , who are worried that Bechtel 's extensive operations in Saudi Arabia have given Shultz an excessive sympathy for the Arab cause , foreign leaders who know Shultz - and a surprising number know him quite well-regard him as a cool , pragmatic professional .
