The nation 's newest diplomat is off to meet the Soviets <P> There was no leisurely breaking-in period for Edmund Muskie as the 58th U.S. Secretary of State . Just eight days after being sworn into office , the nation 's newest diplomat was scheduled to meet with one of the world 's most experienced : Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko , who has dealt with ( and irritated ) every American Secretary of State since John Foster Dulles in 1957 . <P> Muskie and Gromyko will both be in Vienna to participate in ceremonies marking the 25th anniversary of the treaty ending the postwar occupation of Austria . Though their meeting is expected to be little more than a polite chat , it has symbolic importance . Not since superpower relations were severely chilled by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has there been any high-level contact between Washington and Moscow .

To prepare for the meeting , Muskie last week pored over a stack of briefing books and huddled with the State Department 's top Soviet experts . During testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the confirmation hearings for his new post , he said : " I would expect each side to undertake to lay out its perception of each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim , as Moscow does in public , that it sent a " limited Soviet military contingent " into Afghanistan in response to an appeal from the Kabul regime . <P> Muskie is certain to dispute firmly any such interpretation . Though long an advocate of U.S.-Soviet detente , Muskie told the Senate last week that he had been " as shaken as the American people were " by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . As a result , he said , " we must not relent in imposing a heavy price " on Moscow . And he added : " The burden at this point falls on the Soviets to change their policy in Afghanistan . " This tough stance seems in tune with the public 's mood . A survey taken earlier this year by the Foreign Policy Association revealed that 62% of the respondents think the Administration 's foreign policy has been too weak ; in 1978 only 44% felt that way .
