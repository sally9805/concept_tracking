The echoes of that earlier march were invoked throughout the day , and pictures of the assassinated black leader were everywhere : on placards , posters and baseball caps hawked by souvenir vendors . Above the stands for the speakers and the singers , a banner proclaimed , " The Dream Lives On , " a reference to the " I have a dream " refrain with which Dr. King punctuated his vision of a racially harmonious America. // Yet , except for occasional moments of chanting , this was a far less spontaneous assembly that professed its allegiance to dozens of causes through T-shirts and placards . Some stressed disarmament , others non-intervention in Latin America . Union contingents demanded jobs. // // A Bazaar of Slogans // There were appeals for voter registration and for an end to the death penalty , for greater women ' s rights and for the acceptance of homosexuals . There were posters calling for the ouster of the Reagan Administration , and there were units representing black fraternities , ecological parties , leftist splinter groups. // Each of these seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own favorite causes in what sometimes appeared to be a bazaar of slogans and strategies. // For this reporter , it all contrasted sharply with memories , perhaps tinged with nostalgia , of the scene 20 years ago . In that earlier gathering there had been more cohesion and more sense of purpose . The demands had been clear : the immediate passage of a comprehensive civil rights bill guaranteeing access by black people to public accommodations , housing , integrated education and the ballot box . The target was Congress . <> <> In Their Sunday Best // Few of the people who came then had been in previous demonstrations , and none had been in such a huge protest . There were no rules , and people were on their best behavior , often wearing their Sunday best . Most were black , although there were many whites. // There was the pressure of the crowd wedging a young white man against a group of middle-aged black women from South Carolina , leading to an exchange of " I ' m sorry ' s , " apologizing not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the fault of anyone then present. // If a crowd can have a personality , then the personality of that earlier coming together was shy . In the course of that Wednesday afternoon , the crowd , aware of the fears and predictions of violence , discovered its own strength and grew proud of its discipline . A spirit had spread rather spontaneously , and a collective consciousness was shaped and given definition by Dr. King ' s speech . <> <> More Confident , Less Uplifted // This morning , while the busloads were still pouring in and the crowd behind the Lincoln Memorial was rallying to its many disparate slogans and symbols , the people seemed much more assertive and self-confident though less united and less uplifted . It was as if they had moved from dreams to demands. // Dick Gregory , the comedian , referred to this as he and Bill Cosby gave directions to the crowd for its walk to the Lincoln Memorial. // " Don ' t go comparing this march to the one 20 years ago , " Mr. Gregory said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us were scared . We ' re not scared today . When we came here 20 years ago , we came to ask the folks to take care of our business . We ' re here to take care of our own business today. " // James Harris , a marcher today and 20 years ago , agreed . " It ' s like Dick Gregory said , we were scared , " said Mr. Harris , a black Virginian who had come here with a delegation from the United Automobile Workers . He said he thought that despite the fears there was more discipline two decades ago . <> <> Changes in Crowd ' s Mood // " Just before that first march there had been real trouble in Danville , Va. , and there had been the sit-ins , " he said , " and while people didn ' t know what to expect here in Washington , they were alert and aware . " It seemed that the crowd kept gaining confidence throughout that day , surprising itself and its leaders in the early afternoon when , unbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without Dr. King , arriving at the site before the leaders did. // At today ' s march , which seemed to have more white participants than the first one , there was a similar change of tempo when the multitude was sent off to walk along the Mall to the Lincoln Memorial . After mostly perfunctory responses to the morning speeches , a new liveliness set in as the groups began to walk . Some were transformed from audience to performers . And for the first time , some began to sing " We Shall Overcome " and to chant " Freedom , Freedom , Freedom , Freedom , Freedom , " as Dr. King ' s followers did 20 years ago . <> <> Criticisms of Reagan // One group , marching under the banner of Malcolm X , the assassinated Black Muslim leader who had boycotted the 1963 march , demanded " Peace , bread and black power . " But it was far outnumbered by those who marched in support of disarmament and jobs , and the closest thing to a unifying rallying call was a periodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ve got to watch our feet because we have a President who dances with his mouth , " said Mr. Cosby to great laughter at one point. // " Let ' s wave bye-bye to Ron as he rides off into the sunset , " said Margaret Kuhn , the leader of the Gray Panthers , a group opposing discrimination against the elderly. // One feminist marcher walked under a sign identifying herself as " a low-level Munchkin , " a profession of solidarity with Barbara Honegger , the Justice Department aide who resigned this week after denouncing the Administration ' s policies on women ' s rights . <> <> A Festive Occasion // It was a festive march today , and most people were dressed as if for a picnic . Nowhere were there the young men and women in the blue country overalls that served in the 1963 march as the uniforms of the young organizers who had been in places like Selma , Danville and Sunflower County , Miss. // Jacqueline Schmitt is an Episcopal minister who came here from Raleigh , N.C. , where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said she had come with the hope that with so many people reflecting related views , a new consciousness might form. // " There ' s definitely more coming together than breaking apart , " she said , " and people are beginning to understand that things like jobs , racism and the interventions in Latin America are related. " // Government , too , had become more subtle , she said. // " They don ' t come down on you with dogs any more , " she said , " but they effectively ignore the concerns we are raising here. " // As for the spirit of the day , she remarked : " What we need is the spirit , and you can ' t predict the spirit . What we ' re talking about is getting religion . A lot of progress has already been made , and I ' m sure there will be more. " // And that spurred another 20-year- old memory : picking up a black hitchhiker on the way home from the rally , and stopping in Ann Arundel County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sign on the door said : " No Negroes.
