46 A story ? by Jonathan Penner AVID KAPLAN , a freelance illustrator of thirty-six who lived in Greenwich Village , was practically the only person he knew who had never been in psychotherapy . Now , when he had almost decided to start , he feared he was making a mistake . No shrink could help with what worried him most : all his money was in the stock market , which had sunk to a new low and might collapse entirely  --  who could tell ? Not his stockbroker , Kaplan was sure . Steve , who was also his cousin , had tricked and bullied him when they were children . Once he had duped Kaplan into eating clay , moist pellets the size of jelly beans , warm from Steve 's rolling palms . Often Kaplan could still taste it . Whenever he mentioned this to his cousin , Steve grew furious , denying that anything like it had happened . Kaplan was crackers , he said , one hand jingling the coins in his pocket , his bald head shining aggressively . Kaplan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy 's terrific , " Steve said . " See him for Barbara 's sake , if you wo n't for your own . " Steve 's guy was Phil Traub . Kaplan 's mother , however , recommended a Dr. Del Vecchio , who had worked wonders for her friends . " Edith Timmerman was climbing the walls , " she said . " And now ! " To suggest Edith 's present relaxation , Kaplan 's mother released a ball of cigarette smoke with a pop of her lips . Kaplan screwed up his eyes . She apologized . But the ball was already expanding , enveloping Kaplan as he flapped his hand at it . His girlfriend , Jane  --  his first affair as a married man  --  was pushing for Frederika Grunwald , her own therapist for four years . " She ca n't shrink us both , can she ? " Kaplan asked . " Whose side would she be on ? " But though he raised objections , he secretly welcomed all advice . If he was going to go into this at all ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing was to choose his doctor carefully . It was for a Monday that he managed to set up the appointments . " I 'll probably be all right , " his wife said . Thoughtfully she felt her breastbone , like Jonathan Penner , author of the novel Going Blind , teaches fiction writing at the University of Arizona . an item of produce perhaps too ripe . " Suppose I need to go to the hospital ? " " Is n't your painting group meeting here ? " Barbara belonged to a circle of artists who shared a model once a week . " I 'll have to call that off . " She peered at Kaplan . " You think I 'm making it up ? " He shook his head . Ever since her heart attack , Barbara had been weak and floppy as a houseplant , and often terrified him by holding her chest and turning pale . " If you do n't feel well , " he said , " you should rest . " The concern that he heard in his voice depressed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , today and forever . " Your pity is a razor blade , " she said . " Do n't start this , okay ? " " If I thought I could rely on the ambulance I would n't even ask you . " " What 's this ambulance ? " " I can always call your mother . " She turned away . Kaplan could see , through her thinning hair , the dead white of her scalp . " Go , David , " she said . " Go . " IS FIRST appointment was at ten with Traub , who practiced high up in an old building west of Central Park . The chairs in Traub 's office were covered with white Naugahyde , the Naugahyde with transparent plastic . Kaplan was revolted and sat with difficulty . It was like the waiting room at his mother 's beauty parlor . When Kaplan said his life was succumbing to entropy , had lost its critical mass  --  when he told how his life seemed to be living him , rather than vice versa  --  Traub soon began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's words hung there in a cartoonist 's bubble . " I 'd like some specifics , " he said . " Some particulars ? " " Specifics , particulars , " Traub said indifferently . Kaplan could n't stand a quibbler . " Money , " he said . " You mean like that ? " " Money , " Traub agreed . " My father 's estate was in the six figures . Then I let my cousin Steve put me in new issues . Ham King ? A franchise deal , trades on the fame of Hamilton King . " " Hamilton King ? " " I bought it at eleven . Sold it at eight . Then there was Medicomp . " " The baseball player ? " " Golfer , " said Kaplan , annoyed . It seemed to him painfully affected for a man with these chairs not to know Hamilton King . " Medicomp we missed at issue . It came at fifteen , I caught it at seventeen ; I was lucky to get out at twelve . What 's left is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve touted it to me at six , I bought it at nine ; now the bid price is three and an eighth . " Across the room , a digital clock advanced to 10:16 . " It 's money . " " Money . " " Money . " " Specifics . " " One thing , I married unhappily . If I could afford the support , I 'd leave Barbara . " " Why are you looking at the clock ? " " The market opened at ten . " " And your money may be trickling away . " Traub dragged everything he could from the word : tricka-ling . " How does that make you feel ? " Kaplan had a mental picture of his large , bald cousin cradling a telephone receiver between shoulder and ear while with delicate fingers he unwrapped a candy bar . " I 'm sitting in Protection . Devices , off two last week . Say now I call and ask Steve , Steve , should n't I get out . He 'll tell me take it easy , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the weak money . Hang tough for Barbara 's sake , if you ca n't for your own . " ' And this makes you feel ? " " Agonized . " " I mean now . " Traub frowned . " I do n't believe you 're feeling a thing . You own how many shares of Protection Devices ? " Kaplan saw that he could never work with Traub . " Fifteen thousand . " " So let 's see . Last week you lost thirty thousand dollars . " " Okay , I should have sold right then . Steve talked me out of it . " " And how did you feel after you let him do that ? " Now Traub had pierced him . Kaplan pictured himself replacing the phone after that conversation t with Steve , and the feeling he had had came gurgling up , a nauseous , ruptured sensation . " This is absurd , sitting here talking about it . You 'd sell , would n't you , Dr. Traub ? I ought to be parked in Treasury bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . " Traub said nothing , but seemed amused . Kaplan guessed that Traub had written him off . Steve appeared to be away from his desk , said the switchboard girl . The Dow ? Off twelve . No , Kaplan said , Steve could n't call him , he 'd try later . When he hung up he realized that he 'd been cradling the phone to hide it from Traub , who was now standing . " 1 know , " Kaplan said . " My fault . I felt negative the minute I walked in . Personal things like furnishings " ? he shuddered and gathered himself in the chair ? " should n't matter . It 's my own fault . I 'm an illustrator . My wife paints . " Traub was his . He stared at Kaplan for a long moment , then could n't stop himself from answering , " The taste is my wife 's . " APLAN 'S next appointment was with short , silver-haired DelVecchio , the kind of rugged little man who always made him want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clever , but cold , " he said , looking around the room . " I 'll admit this , she 's been loyal . " It was the paintings : swirling oils in thickly caked earth tones , slapped on with a putty knife . Cattle wallows . " Jane 's spontaneous and warm , but I do n't know whether to trust her . " As though exasperated , DelVecchio sighed . He sat behind a desk , which Kaplan had thought psychiatrists never did  --  a fussy desk  --  antique , richly carved , carelessly refinished . " A younger man is after her , " Kaplan said . " A fellow student , one Conrad . She says he 's just an entertaining mind . I 'm not sure what to think . " " You 're not angry ? " DelVecchio 's eyebrows rose dramatically , as though he were acting out the word astonished in a game of charades . " In a personal sense he 's nothing to me . " " What sort of man would n't feel anger ? How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had always liked being told what he was feeling , on which his mind was more open than he guessed it should be , but he was starting to feel disoriented . DelVecchio 's manner suggested that he was not here with Kaplan alone . He spoke and gestured as though from a stage , making Kaplan suspect that this session was being videotaped . A shrink would relish that question . " Or maybe , " DelVecchio pursued , " you have n't invested much in Jane , despite what you 're telling me . I want to hear more about your wife . " Kaplan said he 'd get a divorce if he could afford one , and explained how Steve 's advice had left him practically broke . " I decided this morning to sell out , but he 's away from his desk while the market is collapsing . " " And toward him you feel ? " " Resentment , naturally . " " Resentment . " DelVecchio screwed up his face in a pantomime of confusion . He scratched his head and shook it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mere resentment ? " " You do n't know Steve . His stupidity is a force of nature . You do n't hate the weather . " DelVecchio nodded , satisfied , as though Kaplan 's response nicely confirmed a pretty hypothesis . " We 'll need to talk more about your cousin . " " I 'd like to talk to him now , " Kaplan said . " May I call ? " DelVecchio pushed his phone across the desk . But the word was that Steve had gone for the day . The Dow was off nineteen . Kaplan slammed down the phone , shouting , " How can he leave in the middle of a panic ? At this moment I could be wiped out . " DelVecchio tilted back and crossed his ankles on his desk . " What sort of man am I describing ? " he said , and began ticking points off on his fingers . " Despite lack of gratification , helplessly orbits his invalided wife . Approaching forty , he 's troubled by his hatred of his mother . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue it from his dominant cousin . He 's calm about the possible loss of his girlfriend . He feels what ? A genteel resentment . " Dramatizing disbelief , DelVecchio half averted his face , pushing the heels of both palms toward Kaplan in a double stiff-arm . " I do n't buy that . " Kaplan felt suddenly exhausted . " I 'll never convince you , " he said . " And you 'll never convince me , the way you do those reactions . Why not say what you think ? You 've got the case all doped out . " DelVecchio 's feet stayed on his desk . " As a matter of fact I have , " he said . " First of all , the switch to a new libidinal object is a universal fantasy , someday they 'll find a gene for it . As for investing , I like special-situation asset plays . But this is superficial . We do n't change the world , we change ourselves . " Now his feet came down and he leaned forward earnestly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I had to . Look . " He tugged back a cuff . " Last night I repaired this watch myself . Notice the paintings ? " He swept an arm through the air . " Mine . I refinished every piece in my home . And office . " He rapped his knuckles on the desk . APL AN met Jane for lunch at Oscar 's . She had n't slept , and her headache was killing her . Jane 's headaches were frequent . The more haggard she looked , the more touchingly lovely Kaplan thought her . He wondered whether at such times she reminded him of Barbara . Sometimes , sitting on the edge of Jane 's bed , massaging her scalp , he felt the profoundest peace he had known in years . But today his sorrow was for himself , and he resented her being in pain . Over the chowder , he told her that his hopes now rested with Frederika Grunwald . " Freddy 's brilliant , - but she 's not the good witch , " Jane said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't expect that , " Kaplan said , " and why are you protecting her ? " Jane scraped angrily at the bottom of her bowl . " On this of all days , you should be protecting me . " ? " That 's exactly what I 'm doing . " Kaplan waved for the next course . The waiter removed their chowder bowls . " Let 's say I asked you to come with me right now , take a taxi to the airport , and fly somewhere and start a new life . Do n't look that way , it is n't a test . " " I 've never believed you wanted that . " " Would you ? " The fish arrived . Jane rubbed her temples . " David , do n't make me do this . Ca n't you see how sick I feel ? " threadbare path crossed the Oriental carpet ; the sofa 's black leather was splitting with age . Grunwald herself looked frayed and poor , which disturbed Kaplan in view of her fee : seventy-five , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoothly , this third time , talked about himself . But when he was done she shook her head and said , " I had not quite understood . I could n't treat anyone who is deeply involved with another of my patients . " " I told Jane that , " Kaplan said , annoyed . " I knew you 'd feel this way . Why did you even agree to see me ? " The old woman looked embarrassed . " I think I must apologize , " she said . " Jane did n't tell you that she and I are intimate ? " She said nothing , but shook her head slowly in reprimand of herself . Her dewlap swung . " Then what has she been telling you ? " Kaplan demanded . He was beginning to feel dizzily weak , the way he had when he and Barbara , both sick with the flu , had tried to make love anyway . " Did n't she tell you that I was her lover ? Or did she say her lover was Conrad ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychoanalyst said comfortingly . " I think all of us have been seduced a little . " Kaplan jumped up in a spasm of despair . " Dr. Grunwald , " he said , " this has been very useful . I do n't need psychotherapy at all . I know my problems , do n't you think so ? Now I have to ? " He hurried out to the waiting room , where Jane lay rigid on the floor , holding her head between spread fingers . " This is the worst one ever , " she whispered . " This is agony . " Kaplan grabbed her by the arm . " Come on . " " You 'll take me home ? " " To my house . " " No , this is killing me . " In the cab he howled at her , ignoring the driver 's glances from his rearview mirror . She shrank against her door and threatened to get out at the next light . Kaplan forced himself to fold his arms . " Freddy told me you and Conrad are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 've always been a coward . This was your miserable way of ending it . " " He 's just an entertaining mind , all right ? " The phrase failed to tranquilize Kaplan as it had in the past . " Okay , " he said , " I 'm going to believe you . Here 's what we 'll do . You 'll go home while I arrange things with Barbara . I 'll tell her it 's over and I 'll convert everything to cash . Then you and I take off . " But Jane was slowly shaking her bowed head , her face hidden in her hands . " I ca n't let you do that , " she said in a muffled voice . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Kaplan said raggedly . She looked up . Her wet eyes were brilliant . " Da-vid , you were wonderful to me . Right now I feel " ? she searched for a comparison ? " like your mother . 7 ) He understood , without any real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first feeling was shame . Then , before he realized he was angry , he was swinging a backhand at her . She raised her pocketbook and he cracked his knuckles agonizingly on its metal buckle . " That 's it , Jane , that 's it , " he shouted , until the words were only sound . But by the time the cab turned onto his street , ? Kaplan was calmer . Though things were now bad , he felt that he was getting to the bottom of them , ripping the last bandages from a rotten wound . He leaned forward , elbows on knees , fingers laced behind his neck , drawing breath and expelling it carefully . When they pulled up in front of his brownstone , he could see people from Barbara 's painting group at the windows of his second-floor apartment . " So long , " he told Jane . " David , not like this , " she pleaded . But he got out , paid the driver , and gave him Jane 's address . The cab pulled away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered his building and climbed the stairs , one foot appearing before him as the other plunged away . It was just one moment that you perpetually had to endure . When he reached the top of the stairs , he found his apartment door open . The living room seemed crowded . In the doorway stood his mother , her face red and wet . Next to her was his cousin Steve . " Where have you been ? " his mother demanded . " Getting sold out , " Kaplan said bitterly . Then he told Steve , " You bastard . I needed you today . I wanted to liquidate . " " I 'm sorry , " Steve said . He grabbed Kaplan , hugged him , and began to weep . " I came here when your mother called . " Kaplan freed himself from Steve 's arms . For a moment he watched their twisting faces , then rushed past them into his apartment . In the kitchen , a man was crouched before the open refrigerator . He stood and turned : it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sister filled the hallway but Kaplan pushed past her , ran to the bedroom , ripped the bedding from the great empty bed . He flung it through the air , his nostrils dilating with Barbara 's smell . He was through . That was the only idea that came to Kaplan . There was nothing left in the world for him to worry about . They were staring at him from the bedroom doorway , and he stared back at them . " Okay , " he said mildly . But moment by moment it seemed better than okay . Kaplan felt as relieved as a merchant escaping into bankruptcy . He was as grateful as a gambler in love with a crooked game , who is cleaned out at last , and can go home and sleep . ?
