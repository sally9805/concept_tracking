" I can ' t know in my mind what Brooklyn will be like , but I have been told it is a very big city , with houses 50 or 60 levels high , " said Mr. Khounphom Sone , a 36-year-old refugee from Laos. // " But I want to go to Brooklyn very much , " he said . " Because there is my brother. " // Mr. Khounphom Sone , his 33-year-old wife , Pratsany , and their five children - waiting here in a crowded processing center with papers that say , " Destination : La Guardia " - symbolize in a number of ways the Asian newcomer to America in 1986 , a year of special significance as America celebrates its immigrant heritage with the centennial of the Statue of Liberty. // // Reuniting a Family // They are refugees . From the Middle East to the South China Sea there are almost seven million refugees in Asia , about half of them Afghans who have fled to Pakistan . Others include Vietnamese boat people , exiled Sri Lankan Tamils , Cambodians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was a village leader and who bears a Lao tattoo on his arm that translates " Son of a Warlord , " is seeking to reunite a family torn apart by war and revolution. // " Asian immigration is increasing in a geometric pattern because of family reunions and migrations , " a United States consular official said . " A family chain develops ; a community grows . " Under current immigration law , close relatives of United States residents receive preference in immigration proceedings and are not counted as part of the quota for people from their country who are allowed to immigrate. // Mr. Khounphom Sone ' s family is poor and has had little education ; Mr. Khounphom Sone ( pronounced koon-POM so-NAY ) had four years of primary schooling and is a mechanic ; his wife was a noodle-shop waitress . Increasingly , refugee and immigration officials say , people with limited skills , facing hard times in the developing world , want a chance to be American. // From China to Indonesia , from Manila to Bombay , people tell interviewers that they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get an education. " // Consular and refugee officials who meet hundreds of thousands of would-be Asian emigrants to the United States say little has changed in the basic reasons refugees want to live in America . <> <> Following the Children // " The pull factor is still there , " an American official said . " They see the same gold sidewalks. " // In most of the developing nations in Asia , there remains a belief that life is better in America - economically and politically , but above all in terms of education. // Though many refugees have seen ample evidence of American shortcomings in films and television , most profess a belief that Americans are on the whole " fair people , " as one Southeast Asian put it , and that they will give anyone who works hard a chance. // In Asia , there are other motivating factors for emigration , according to consular officials. // An American diplomat here pointed to the elderly Asians , living comfortably in their own societies , who go to Los Angeles or New York only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after them , and the younger generation is no longer in Asia. // " We as Americans , with our looser family ties , don ' t always understand this , " this consular official said . " A grandmother or grandfather who probably speaks no English may not really want to go . But that ' s where all the kids are. " // The line frequently blurs between political asylum and economic migration . Boat people from Vietnam tell reporters regularly that they are leaving because , as one recent arrival in Thailand said , " Communism doesn ' t give us rice or work. " // Mr. Khounphom Sone is also representative of the hundreds of thousands of Laotians , Cambodians and Vietnamese who have suffered suspicion and retribution because of their association with the American side in the wars that brought Communist governments to those countries in the 1970 ' s. // Tens of thousands of Indochinese remain in political prison camps ; others are languishing in Thailand as displaced people , asking any American who comes along why they have been forgotten. // Mr. Khounphom Sone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the defeated Lao army , he was able to escape from seven years of political detention in October 1983 when the truck taking his work gang to a forced-labor project near Pakse , in southern Laos , hit what was probably an unexploded American bomb . <> <> Crossing the Mekong River // Wounded from the blast , he crept from his hospital bed and fled to Vientiane , 375 miles away. // There his wife , who had been able to visit him regularly in detention , joined him four days later with their children . When night fell , he put his wife and three little girls on a bamboo raft . He and his son , Soutchay , then 11 , swam and pushed the family across the Mekong River to Thailand. // More than 300 , 000 people , almost a tenth of the population of Laos , have fled the country since the Communist takeover in 1975 . Many of them , though not Mr. Khounphom Sone ' s family , come from the Hmong and other hill tribes in remote mountain areas of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Thailand has soared to almost 90 , 000 , the Thai Government has recently opened the camps to interviewers from the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service . Refugee officials say that Laotians will probably form the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group accepted for American resettlement this year . <> <> A Brother in Texas // It was in a Thai refugee camp that Mr. Khounphom Sone found his father-in-law and learned from him that Mr. Khounphom Sone ' s two brothers , who had fled Laos earlier , were in the United States. // One brother , Siritham Korakahn , 40 , had become a welder in Texas . The other , Souvanh Vilayvanh , 23 , of Brooklyn , has had a succession of jobs and intermittent illnesses that kept him out of work , Mr. Khouphom Sone said . But Mr. Souvanh Vilayvanh had married an American , had an apartment and was able to act as the family ' s sponsor. // And so the family - Sone and Pratsany , along with Soutchay , who is now 14 , and four daughters : Khanthadokmay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thaithouna , who is 8 months old - wait for the bus to Bangkok airport , and a life they can not even imagine. // Drawn from some of the most isolated villages in Asia , the Laotians often face unexpected trauma in the West , refugee officials say . Learning About the U.S. Amornpan Nimanan , the Thai commander of the refugee processing center where Mr. Khounphom Sone ' s family has been staying , said he had seen Lao refugees weep with fear in a bus on the Oakland Bay Bridge as they rode to a new life. // Laotians have met harassment and violence in several American cities , as have Cambodians . Refugee officials say that on the whole the Vietnamese , more urbanized and more aggressive , have fared better , along with ethnic Chinese and Korean migrants. // At Phanat Nikhom and other camps throughout Asia an effort is made to teach the refugees English , with special " high school English " courses for teen-agers . Occasionally , videotapes made in American communities are shown. // While many Asians now trying to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a wave of more highly skilled immigrants may be imminent . As Hong Kong ' s assimilation by China approaches , an unknown number of Hong Kong residents is expected to leave the colony , some with considerable fortunes. //
