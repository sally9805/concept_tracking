George Bush did not expect a honeymoon , but he did not get even the quiet Florida fishing weekend he had hoped for . Just after American voters overwhelmingly chose him over Michael Dukakis , the world 's financial markets sent Bush a message of their own : the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 75 points , followed by the dollar 's drop to near postwar lows against the yen . Investors who had sat quietly through candidate Bush 's repeated taunts to Congress to " Read my lips  --  no new taxes " decided that President-elect Bush had no convincing plan to cut the nation 's towering trade and budget deficits . As the slide started , Bush hastily convened a seaside press conference to reassure nervous markets . With Atlantic waves crashing behind him , he allowed that his new burdens made him feel a bit " shell shocked , " adding , " The problems are tremendous . " <P> This dose of reality comes with Ronald Reagan still President and the Inauguration two months away . Yet Bush and his nascent team are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bush moved + quickly , while stressing continuity : after announcing on the day after his election that his close friend James Baker would be Secretary of State , he tapped Nicholas Brady to remain as Treasury Secretary . Bush promised to name the rest of his economic team promptly and hold budget talks with congressional leaders before his Inauguration ; he started Friday by having lunch with House Speaker Jim Wright . But all the while , Bush clung to his conviction , shared by Brady , that the economy could grow its way out of the deficit without new taxes or serious spending cuts . " Our most important priority is to keep our economy growing with low inflation , " he said . " We must resist the policies that will impede that effort , such as raising taxes . " <P> That repeat version of Reagan 's 1981 rosy scenario came under fire from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , who told the National Economic Commission on Wednesday that the supply-side approach was " fanciful " and implied that Bush 's " flexible freeze " plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not act promptly , " said Greenspan , " the imbalances in the economy are such that the effects of the deficit will be increasingly felt and with some immediacy . " <P> Within hours , the markets echoed that skepticism , accelerating the dollar 's fall to a low rate of 121.52 yen . Improved trade figures did not stanch the bleeding ; the damage was halted only by the purchase of $5 billion by foreign central banks , led by the Bank of Japan . Noted John Williamson , a senior fellow at Washington 's Institute of International Economics : " Foreign investors are not happy . They read Bush 's lips too . "
