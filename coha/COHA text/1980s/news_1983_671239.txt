A student had brought in a lizard that had lost part of its tail . Suddenly the lizard was part of the fractions lesson . " You know , class , when Shoneice brought this lizard in here , she didn ' t know she was dealing with a fraction of a lizard , " Mr. Merriman said , quickly drawing a lizard diagram on the blackboard . " This is everyday stuff we ' re dealing with , boys and girls . Real good stuff ! " // Last winter , Mr. Merriman was chosen as one of the Los Angeles Unified School District ' s first 200 " master teachers . " As a reward , he receives $1 , 008 a year in merit pay in addition to his regular salary . The Los Angeles system is the largest in the country to offer merit pay , and despite opposition from some teachers ' organizations , the school board recently endorsed extending the program for another year. // About 700 teachers of the district ' s 32 , 000 teachers applied for the master teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of schools . " They went and twisted some arms , " she said . " Some teachers felt it wasn ' t worth all the extra work for a thousand dollars a year . " <> <> Extra Pay for Extra Work // Merit pay is based on the theory that if the best teachers can be encouraged to stay in the classroom by financial incentives , the result will be better performance by students and other teachers . Merit pay is supported by President Reagan as a means to improve the quality of education , and opposed by many teachers ' organizations that fear that the awards could be arbitrary and politically motivated. // The United Teachers of Los Angeles is opposed to the program , but there is little overt controversy about it here chiefly because the master teachers are assigned extra duties to help other teachers improve their skills. // Merit pay was proposed here by Superintendent Harry Handler and approved by the city school board . Earlier this month the board strongly endorsed retaining the merit program despite a new round of budget cuts for next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000. // School administrators say the program has not been in operation long enough to accurately assess its impact , for example , to say whether it is having a beneficial effect on learning , but critics of the program have already cited some objections . <> <> Teachers Nominate Themselves // The main criticism is that selection of master teachers will be subject to the whims and favoritism of administrators . The Los Angeles program attempts to defuse much of that criticism by allowing teachers to nominate themselves to be master teachers . According to the United Teachers of Los Angeles , there have been no grievances or other formal complaints filed over the selection issue. // Another concern voiced by teachers ' unions is that if some teachers are singled out as " masters , " parents would pressure schools to assign their children only to those teachers . There has been little evidence of that happening. // " We didn ' t have that experience at all , " said Morrie Greenberg , principal of Thomas Starr King Jr . High School . " I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s class or another more on what they ' ve heard from other parents than by this kind of program , " he said. // Critics also say merit pay is divisive and damaging to teacher morale , but teacher reaction here appears to have been low-key . However , R.C. Reimann , principal of Palisades High School in an affluent section of the city , said not one teacher at his school accepted the opportunity to participate , out of a sense of esprit de corps. // " No one , zero , nada , zilch , " Dr. Reimann said . " Our staff opted not to be involved . They felt everyone was a master teacher at our school . " <> <> Selection of Master Teachers // The master teacher selection begins with a regional selection committee ' s evaluation of a list of criteria , including training and background , advanced degrees and leadership qualities . Committees are composed of a principal , an instructional supervisor , a teacher and a parent , and the assessment includes watching the applicant perform in the classroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers are assigned several less-experienced teachers to coach , and some master teachers are called on to lead training classes and workshops . There is no set requirement for extra time that must be worked , but master teachers commonly say they put in far above their normal classroom hours. // A substitute teacher can be assigned to take over the master teacher ' s own class for up to 10 hours a semester to allow the master teachers to observe their client-teachers at work . According to Joseph P. Linscomb , associate superintendent for instruction for the Los Angeles school system , that is one of the key provisions that makes the program financially feasible . The $800 , 000 this year covered both incentive pay and the substitutes . <> <> Raises for All Are Urged // Mr. Merriman , a teacher for 20 years who earned bachelor ' s and master ' s degrees from the University of Michigan , said he believed " all of us should be compensated for our efforts , not just me , " and that teacher pay should be raised across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low is because it ' s a womandominated profession , " he said . But he also said that teachers of extra ability ought to be rewarded for it. // His fellow teachers at the Menlo Avenue School , in a low-income Hispanic and black neighborhood near the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , agreed. // " If you put out the extra effort , you definitely should be paid for it , because so many teachers come here just to collect their money and really don ' t put anything into it anymore , " said Barbara LaFrano , a teacher. // Les Pollack , a master teacher at Thomas Starr King Jr . High School , said there was initial resentment on the part of some of the clients he was assigned to coach . " They thought they were earmarked for early retirement , " he said , when most often they were teachers who principals felt had considerable latent potential . That attitude changed . " At the schools I visited , the word spread from the clients and there was a lot of enthusiasm , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of the colleagues of master teachers has been lukewarm . Ron Patton , chairman of the English department at Mr. Pollack ' s school , said he and others feared the master teacher designation was the first step toward establishing different pay schedules that would be unfair . " It ' s just a matter of time when we will have this imposed on us , " he said. // The California Legislature is considering adopting a statewide master teacher program based on the one in Los Angeles , but the proposal has run into opposition from Gov . George Deukmejian , who wants to delay school spending increases until next year. // However , the state teachers ' union , in a softening of its position , has endorsed the $26 million statewide proposal . Marilyn Russell Bittle , president of the California Teachers Association , said negotiations toward providing a raise for all teachers and for guaranteeing teachers a substantial role in master teacher selection had made the program acceptable. //                 @ @ @ @
