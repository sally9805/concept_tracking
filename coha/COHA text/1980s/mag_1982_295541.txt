The Marines have landed , again , and Israel launches a massacre probe <P> Some waded ashore through waist-deep Mediterranean waters , their M-16 automatic rifles held high over their heads . Others arrived in amphibious assault vehicles that splashed up on the beach and rumbled toward the airport . Still others clambered out of hovering Chinooks and Sea Stallions from the aircraft carrier Guam , anchored some two miles offshore . The U.S. Marines were back in Lebanon last week , 1,200 strong , only 19 days after leaving that embattled country following the evacuation of some 11,000 Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas from West Beirut . The latest mission of the Leathernecks ' , as well as of French and Italian troops : to help the Lebanese government maintain order in the wake of last month 's massacre of as many as 400 Palestinians by Lebanese Christian militia forces allied to Israel . <P> The other members of the multinational peace-keeping force had already taken up their positions by the time the Marines landed . France 's 1,560 men were stationed in the northern part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the massacre took place . To the south were 1,200 Italians , whose zone included Burj al Barajneh , the largest Palestinian camp in West Beirut . The American zone consisted of the area around Beirut International Airport ( see map ) . <P> The Marines ' landing had been delayed four days by a dispute over the evacuation of Israeli troops from the airport . The Israelis had arranged to keep a small technical unit there , but the Reagan Administration insisted on the removal of all but one Israeli air controller from the airport and all other troops from Beirut . Prime Minister Menachem Begin capitulated to the American demands after receiving what U.S. officials described as an " extremely tough " cable from Washington . <P> Administration officials had little time to rejoice over that small victory before they received more bad news from Beirut . A 155-mm " cluster " shell , of the type supplied by the U.S. to Israel , exploded on the airport tarmac , killing one Marine and wounding three others . The shell was apparently left over from the heavy fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dead man , Corporal David L. Reagan , 21 , of Chesapeake , Va. , was a combat engineer assigned to clear the airport of land mines and other explosives . <P> That accident came at a time of both hope and worry as Lebanon groped for a semblance of normality in the aftermath of its repeated disasters . Only hours before the fatal explosion , Lebanese President Amin Gemayel had officially reopened the airport to commercial flights and proclaimed an end to the so-called Green Line that since the 1975-76 civil war had divided the capital into a pre dominantly Muslim West and a Christian East . At a festive Beirut ceremony , complete with Lebanese military bands playing Yankee Doodle , Gemayel called the relinking of the city " a symbol of national unity and unity of the hearts .
