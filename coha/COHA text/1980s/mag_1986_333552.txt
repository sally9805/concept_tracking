A thousand dollars a word is a hefty price to pay for any document , but this one is special . Written in 1818 by the 75-year-old Thomas Jefferson to Mordecai Noah , one of America 's first Zionists , the letter contains a stirring attack on anti-Semitism and all forms of religious bigotry . <P> " Your sect by it 's sufferings , " wrote the author of the Declaration of Independence , " has furnished a remarkable proof of the universal spirit of religious intolerance , inherent in every sect , disclaimed by all while feeble , and practised by all when in power . " After spirited bidding at Sotheby 's in New York City , the browned , spotted piece of paper went to Ludwig Jesselson , 75 , a collector of Judaica . The price : $396,000 , the highest figure ever paid for a presidential document .
