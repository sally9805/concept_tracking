When the spotlight shone on Seoul , Americans focused their attention on the efforts by U.S. Olympians to outpace rival athletes from other nations . But there is another form of international competition that the U.S. is unquestionably losing , and it is no game . America , once the perennial champion of world trade , now seems in danger of dropping out of contention . In one industry after another , American companies have lost their lead to foreign competitors that are more innovative , efficient and responsive to the needs of consumers . <P> The stark facts are revealed each month in the trade-deficit figures . Despite recent improvement , the U.S. still imported $80 billion more in goods than it exported in the first seven months of the year . At the current rate , the 1988 trade deficit will total some $130 billion , 23.5% less than last year 's record $170 billion . That progress has resulted primarily from the 40% drop of the dollar against major currencies since early 1985 , which has made imports more expensive and U.S. exports a bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline , the improvement in trade figures has been surprisingly small . The sad truth is that American industry simply is not in good enough shape to take advantage of the weak dollar . Many companies have trouble matching the quality of products from abroad . Other firms are running into production bottlenecks because they have skimped on investment . Some industries have been virtually wiped out by foreign competition : the share of the U.S. consumer electronics market held by American companies has plunged from almost 100% in 1970 to less than 5% today . When the Japanese started coming up with innovative products like VCRs and hand-held video cameras , U.S. firms decided to sell Tokyo 's models rather than try to make their own . In short , U.S. industry no longer has the capacity to produce the quantity , quality or variety of goods that the public demands . <P> The easy explanation , and the one that Michael Dukakis has been hinting at with his economic nationalist talk , is that U.S. companies are the victims of unfair foreign trade practices . Japan , in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " dumping " products in the U.S. at prices that are below the cost of manufacture . The only response , the argument goes , is to protect American industry with quotas and higher tariffs . <P> While supporters of this position often resort to hyperbole and jingoistic rhetoric , their case has an element of truth . The U.S. can not always stick to the rules of free trade when other nations do not . At times , it may be advisable to impose temporary protectionist measures as a bargaining chip . <P> But that weapon should be used sparingly . Protectionism encourages U.S. companies to remain inefficient and drives up prices to consumers . The flap about fair trade obscures an inescapable fact : the fault for our industrial woes lies not with our trading partners but in ourselves . If every trade barrier on earth magically disappeared , the U.S. deficit would probably decline no more than 20% . The primary responsibility for the trade deficit rests both with a profligate Government whose tax and spending policies have encouraged overconsumption and with much of U.S. industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1950s and 1960s.
