 | It is the American character in a can . Friendly , frisky , fizzy , with a little kick . Optimistic , unabashedly itself . Class-leveling . Easy to like . Also dark , full of empty calories ? a lot of gas in a glass . Bottled , canned or spouting from a fountain , it is a national symbol as potent as the flag . In a country dedicated to consumption , it has been the most successful product in history , the undisputed leader of the $25 billion soft-drink industry . At first it was " Delicious and Refreshing . " It could be found " Around the Corner From Anywhere . " Then it was " The Pause That Refreshes , " the thing things went better with , " The Real Thing " ; it added life , was to be enjoyed with a smile . Finally , minimally , it was " It . " But unlike almost every other product ever built or bought , the one thing it never was was new . Now it is new . Coke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does to Brian Morales , who called Coca-Cola headquarters to complain as soon as he heard the news on the radio . " I asked them , Is n't Coke the No. 1 soft drink in the world ? ' " says Morales . " The lady said yes . Then why mess with it ? ' I said . " It matters to a lot of people . Within 24 hours of the announcement , according to Coke 's ad agency , McCann-Erickson , twothirds of the nation had heard of the change ? a level of recognition that many national politicians spend a lifetime failing to achieve . A few anxious drinkers got to sample the new concoction in informal , unscientific taste tests . At the " Disco " Kroger supermarket in Atlanta , the first store in Coke 's home city to get a shipment of the new product , NEWSWEEK conducted its own survey . Annis Dinnerman , a soft-spoken graying lady who said she treasures CocaCola , took her first sips and grimaced . Her verdict : " To use the vernacular of the teenagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it matters to Pepsi , which declared a company holiday ? and victory . " After 87 years of going it eyeball-to-eyeball , the other guy just blinked , " Pepsi boasted in full-page newspaper ads . " Clearly this opens a window of opportunity for us , " says Pepsi president Roger Enrico . " Coke drinkers now have to make a new decision because they ca n't get the product they 've been used to any more ; we 'll invite them to join the Pepsi Generation . " Well might Pepsi gloat . " The giant kneels and the market rec-  | ognizes that , " says Faith Popcorn , president of Brainreserve , a marketing and advertising firm in New York . Coke still commands the largest share of the market ( chart ) , but Pepsi has passed Coke in supermarket and other take-home sales , which account for nearly 44 percent of total sales . Coke still leads at the fountains and restaurants ; all 5,500 McDonald 's , for example , sell Coke . Sweet and Smooth : While it is a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been designed to bestow upon Coke some of the more popular attributes of Pepsi . For one thing the new Coca-Cola is sweeter . " You ca n't measure sweetness , " says Coca-Cola chairman Roberto Goizueta . But you can try : thanks to some added sugar , Coke now has three more calories per 12 ounces , bringing it within two of Pepsi . " It 's a smoother , rounder , yet bolder taste , " says the chairman . But the extra bite that made it hard to guzzle was one of the things that distinguished Coke from Pepsi . " If everyone is going to be smooth and sweet , who 's going to be Coke ? " asks Tom Kenneally , a Houston restaurateur . " Maybe Pepsi ought to come out with Coke 's original formula ; that would fill a void Coke is creating . " To ease the transition , Coke will use longtime spokesman Bill Cosby in 24 new ads and revive the 1971 jingle , " I 'd like to buy the world a Coke . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepsi . In one series of spots Cosby appears as a mystic . " If you 're a Pepsi drinker I predict we 're gon na be real friends . " In the archeologist series , Cosby sifts through relics . " Words I 'm about to say will change the course of history : Coca-Cola has a new taste . . . I like it better . . . if you 're a Pepsi drinker , well , maybe that 'll be history too , " he says . Coke 's revolutionary reformulation is actually something of a rear-guard action . The soft-drink market is breaking in two : sugar and sugar-free . Most growth will come in the diet segment , as aging baby boomers find it harder to keep their figures lean , says analyst Roy Burry of Kidder Peabody &; Co . Yet the sugar side still holds most of the market ; regular Coke accounted for 60 percent of the company 's sales last year . That nondiet market will increasingly be dominated by young drinkers , says Burry , and " Coca-Cola , recognizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drink in the regular product . " The youth market has been Pepsi 's stronghold . " Pepsi has picked up on the psyche of youth and freedom in a very short time and has done so brilliantly , " says Faith Popcorn of Brainreserve . " It has really become the nonconformist drink . It picked up on the whole genre of sass and spunk and the whole cult of youthful , jaded humor . " In the soft-drink field , image is as important as taste , says William Meyers , author of " The Image-Makers : Power and Persuasion on Madison Avenue . " Repositioning Coke as a young person 's drink , he says , will be " like trying to turn a giant tanker around . " There are other troubles in the land where Coke is king . The beverage market has been un-  | dergoing a vast mood swing to the light . The family refrigerator has become a battleground where diet sodas , fruit juices , bottled water and even wine coolers slosh for space with older soft drinks ( chart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " natural sodas " ? no caffeine , no preservatives , no artificial flavors or salt ? that are just beginning to drip their way into the heartland from the twin spigots of trendiness , New York and California . Hansen 's , a California brand made with natural juices , is available in assorted flavors including mandarin orange , cola and root beer . Napa Naturals , launched little more than a year ago , has gone Hansen 's one better by trucking natural mineral water from a spring in Calistoga to its Sacramento , Calif. , bottling plant . Napa also boasts a base that is 51 percent natural fruit juice . Coke and Pepsi are both trying to crack the market with their own versions of natural sodas . Pepsi has started to sell lemon Slice , and Coke is now testing Minute Maid Orange Soda , flavored with orange juice . With more to choose from , consumers naturally are getting more choosy . " Many people in the morning will have a CocaCola , " says Goizueta , " and then for lunch have a diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not huge numbers yet , but it is happening more and more . " Such shifting habits have cut into the sales of both Coke and Pepsi and have vastly complicated the business of selling soda pop . Syrup : The world of drink was far simpler back in 1886 , when pharmacist Dr. John S. Pemberton cooked up the first batch of Coca-Cola syrup in a three-legged brass pot in the backyard of his Atlanta home . The basics of his original had never been altered until now , although minor changes had been made ; cocaine extracts were dropped from the formula in 1903 , but coca leaves are still in there . Among the other known ingredients : lime juice , vanilla , cinnamon and caramel . The recipe , written on one sheet of paper in Dr. Pemberton 's hand , lies locked in a vault of an Atlanta bank , where it will soon be joined by its successor . The discovery of the new formula came by accident . As they experimented with different flavor combinations for diet Coke , chemists stumbled on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly realized was highly preferred by in house expert taste panels over Coca-Cola itself . " The company confirmed that judgment with an extraordinary series of 190,000 blind taste tests of 13- to 59-year-olds in more than 13 cities . The new Coke prevailed convincingly . Goizueta says he mentioned the plans for the change to Coke patriarch Robert Woodruff ? who served as president of the company from 1923 to 1955 ? shortly before he died last March . " The one thing I feel sorry for is that he is not here , " says Goizueta . " Mr. Woodruff was the one who loved to paraphrase Oscar Wilde , The world belongs to the discontented ' . " If too many Coke drinkers are discontented , though , the world will no longer belong to Coke , and the new drink will go down as one of the great fiascos in business history . But when he took charge in 1981 , Goizueta let it be known that he would be a chairman of change . He promised that there would be " no sacred cow in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any or all of our products . " His aggressive attitude helped to reinvigorate what had become a sluggish company . Goizueta , a Cuban-born Yale graduate who joined the company as a chemist in 1954 , has passed the Wall Street taste test . " The old-time sedate , dark-blue-suit , closed-door , narrow-minded , oneway-of-life management philosophy of the Coca-Cola Co. changed " with Goizueta at the helm , says Jesse Meyers , publisher of Beverage Digest . Goizueta started shattering tradition early in his tenure . Putting the sacred Coke name on a new product for the first time , he introduced diet Coke in 1982 . Since then it has been the nation 's hottest-selling soft drink . Earlier this year he slapped the Coke name on another new product , Cherry Coke . Goizueta has moved the company aggressively ? and successfully ? into new fields . buying Columbia Pictures in 1982 for nearly $700 million . In 1984 , Columbia 's hits included " Ghostbusters , " " The Karate Kid , " " A Soldier 's Story " and " A Passage to India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year the entertainment division contributed 11 percent to the company 's operating income of more than $1 billion . Lately there has been talk that Coke might acquire CBS , which is fighting off a takeover attempt by Ted Turner , but many analysts discount the rumors . There will be no long goodbyes for old Coke . The new cans , marked by a silver stripe , will start appearing on supermarket shelves within two weeks . The last of the old Coke should be gone by the end of the summer . " I am very anxious , " says Alice Fisher , president of the 3,500-member Cola Clan , a Coke fan club . " But I know they would n't have done it if it was n't the real thing , and I 'm very pleased . This is history and I feel lucky to have lived to be a part of it . " Goizueta can only hope that the rest of Coke 's fans will be as philosophical and forgiving as their favorite drink becomes a thing of the past .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
