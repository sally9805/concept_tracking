THE TALK OF THE TM " ! Notes and Comment p RESIDENT CARTER 'S proposal to register women as well as men for the draft , being opposed alike by many feminists , who are against any draft , and by many supporters of the draft , who believe that wars should be fought by men , has clouded the policy that inspired the revival of registration in the first place . Intending to demonstrate the country 's unity- and resolve to the Soviet Union in response to its invasion of Afghanistan , the Administration has instead become embroiled in a murky altercation about the influence of women on men in trench warfare and about ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment , all of it superimposed on a renewed protest movement against any draft and a swelling debate , greatly amplified by an exceptionally crowded and busy Presidential campaign , about just what the potential draftees , whether men or women , might have to do under the Carter policy . In the spreading confusion , a sombre declaration of national purpose to the world has degenerated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family loudly putting in his or her word . So far , the argument about women and the draft has centered on reasonable-sounding questions like whether or not women are physically strong enough for combat , but intense passions , undoubtedly fed by apprehensions of a more primeval sort , are churning just beneath the surface . War , of course , got its foothold in human affairs long before women launched their drive , now in full swing in most parts of the globe , for equality with men in the public realm . In the traditional order , as feminist thinkers have often pointed out , the assignment of men to the battlefield and that of women to the domestic household were closely related . The presence of a protected , even hidden , domestic sphere , presided over by women , in which new life was brought into the world and the community was sustained , was felt to give war an elemental justification . As the bearers of children , women were the symbols and substance of peace and life , and were to he spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exclusion of women from war held intact a part of life for which wars could be fought by men . In the logic of this scheme , just as the migration of women from home to office , if it were to be unaccompanied by any rush of men in the opposite direction , would leave the home deserted , and thus would undercut one of the original aims of work namely , the support of life .. , a ) the dis-patch of women to war would , in a manner of speaking , empty out the heart of the community and undercut any justification for fighting . But even to describe these traditional arrangements for domesticity and war , whether one looks on them fondly or with anger , is to reveal that they have broken down irreparably across the board . The most thorough transformation has taken place in war itself . Insofar as any nation 's military forces ever had the ability to protect its people , they have lost it now . The invasion of the civilian realm by modern war began with universal male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to completion with the advent of nuclear weapons , which assail life at its genetic foundations . War has now penetrated to the core of the domestic sphere  --  its capacity for the renewal of life . Nuclear weapons have overmatched the procreativity of nature , and it is now they that , in an appropriation of life 's characteristics , monstrously " proliferate , " and bring forth one " generation " after another , as though death itself had gained the power to give birth and multiply . In the new military strategy , the role of the civilian population , including its heretofore undrafted female half , is to be held hostage by the rival nuclear power . Indeed , it is now an essential element of global stability that each superpower in effect hare the breast of its people to a nuclear attack or counterattack by its adversary ; otherwise , deterrence , which depends on the vulnerability of each side to a reprisal by the other , would break down . Our nation , in a proper display ' of reverence for life , has exerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty hostages in Iran , but , in the same period , when nuclear war over Middle Eastern oil has been under discussion we have somehow managed to pass lightly over the fates of the tens of millions of hostages which are at stake in such a conflict . Once , military forces were deployed to protect the civilian population , but now the civilian population is deployed to protect the military forces . Across the oceans , two vast victim-armies face one another . No one was ever registered to serve in this force , but we have all been conscripted into it anyway . Women , who are certainly strong enough to push the button  --  should any of them aspire to that doubtful honor  --  just as they are weak enough to die in a holocaust , do n't have to be sent to the front lines ; they are already there . ? ? Revirited WE do n't like to start a new dec-ade without catching up on the adventures of John Huston , the movie director and actor . We last wrote about him in 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Galway , Ire-land , where he was living at the time  --  for the opening of his twenty-ninth movie , " Fat City . " Last week , he was here from a beach compound in Las Caletas , Mexico  --  where he is hying now  --  in connection with the fol-lowing activities : preparing for the opening of " Wise Blood , " Movie No. 35 ; turning in to Knopf the final draft of the manuscript of his autobiographical " An Open Book ; " meeting with representatives of the Film Society of Lincoln Center , who intend to have " A Tribute to John Huston " for their annual spring gala , on May 5th ; and planning his next picture , " Escape to Victory , " which he is scheduled to start filming in Hungary in a couple of months with Sylvester Stallone , Michael Caine , Max von Sydow , and Pele , the one and only . Huston is now seventy-three  --  not that the number says much about him , we were delighted to see when we met him at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the frosty night wearing a green-and-beige plaid Irish-wool cap , a white Irish-woo cardigan over a white turtleneck , tan cavalry twill trousers , and brown Maxwell of London moccasins . The cap covered about a sixth of his hair , which was long , white , and gray . His heard , incipiently Tolstoyan , matched . Everything else was the same as it had been for years : the deeply conspiratorial manner , conveying the dramatic impression that each thing he said was strictly confidential ; the unique , melodic actor 's voice to convey it all with ; the loping walk and the enlistment of his entire body to punctuate and underline the talk ; and the welling up of irrepressible laughter at what was being said , especially by him . We followed Huston outside to a limousine , where he greeted the chauf feur with his conspiratorial grace and directed him to take us to 20 West Fifty-seventh Street . There , he told us , he was going to meet Stallone and Pele for the first time . " The picture takes place during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it between the Germans and the hungry , weakened prisoners , " Huston said as the car made its way through heavy evening traffic . " And we 've written in a part for Pele . It will be the first time he 's ever really acted , and I 'm told he 's looking forward to it ! " He gave his laugh , took off his cap , and brushed the hair back from his forehead . " How 's life in Mexico ? " we asked . " Just wonderful  --  just what I want at the moment , " Huston said . " I 've built my own little two-room house , with a fireplace , and separate little houses for a cook , for my assistant , Gladys Hill , and for guests  --  all overlooking the Bahia de Banderas , Bay of Flags . It 's a fifteen-mile drive , to get there , from Puerto Vallarta to Boca de Tomatlin , a tiny fishing village , where I take a boat with an outboard motor , and in thirty minutes I 'm in Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tomatoes , lettuce , corn  --  everything and we have our own fruit trees ! Bananas , pineapples  --  everything . The swimming is just wonderful . And the snorkeling . And there 's time to write and to read ! Did you know that we read in Mexico ? " Huston laughter again . " Of course , I do n't get to stay there as much as I 'd like . I came here from Atlanta , where I did one of the last shots for ' Phobia , ' a Canadian-produced picture of mine , with Paul Michael Glaser , the Starsky of Starsky and Hutch . ' I was in Toronto for three months with that one . Then Mexico for Christsnas . Then to Los Angeles . Then to Atlanta . From here , I go hack to Los Angeles . Back to Mexico for four weeks before starting the soccer picture in May . Freddie Fields , the producer of the picture , met me earlier today . We had to decide on some alternative locations , just in case the Russians make it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cap back on . " We 've got a perfect stadium for OUT soccer game . In Pecs , outside Budapest . It dates from 1940 . Perfect . Well , here we are . " He stuffed his cap in the pocket of the cardigan . As Huston got out of the car , he was greeted by a sporty-looking , Cali fornia-suntanned man wearing a green windbreaker . " Herb Nanas , John , " the man said as we all entered a loft building . " I 'm Sly 's manager . Sly is upstairs , shooting his picture ? Hawks , ' Sly plays a decoy cop . " Nanas spoke in a low voice , almost a whisper . " The picture is without a director , " he said , with a weak smile . " The producer fired the director , so Sly is directing it himself until we get a new director . " " Well , now , " Huston said . " Well , now . " " This way , " Nanas said , ushering us into a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fixed up to look like a clothing designer 's studio and had been taken over by cameras , lights , makeup tables , and about three dozen picture hands , including cameramen , grips , and still photographers . Stallone , who had a dark , short heard and was wearing a sports shirt and bluejeans , with a gun in a holster on one hip , stood near a makeup table looking rather glum . " Sly likes his heard , " Nanas half-whispered to Huston . " He 's depressed about losing it for your picture . John , you know Bob Willoughby , " he added as one of the still photographers came over and shook hands with Huston . " I saw you in Ireland , " Willoughby said . " Seven years ago . " " Of course , " Huston said dramatically . " How are you , Bob ? " " St. Clerans all gone ? " Willoughby asked . " Yes , it 's all gone now , Bob , " Huston said , leaning hack , with a great smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . ? ? " Sly ! " Huston said , hugging Stallone . " John ! " Stallone said , hugging Huston . " Sly admires him enormously , " Nanas said to us . " Sly is thrilled to be working with him . " They were joined by Freddie Fields , a trim , dapper , impeccably arrayed , softly smiling man wearing black-rimmed glasses and carrying a black attache case . " Freddie ! " Huston said . " John ! Sly ! " They huddled in a three-way hug . " Fields is a prime example of your modern producer , " a grip behind us said . " He used to be a prime agent . He founded Creative Management Associates , which is now International Creative Management . Then he turned producer . The agents are becoming the big producers now . " " I think it 's a fine script , " Stallone was saying to Huston . " I think it 's a fine script , " Huston said , giving the line a much better reading . " Here 's Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an enormously warm human being . " Pele , wearing a three-quarter-length coat of marmot fur , ambled over , holding out his hand . " PeIC ! " " John ! Sly ! Freddie ! " A four-way hug . " Erik ! " somebody called out . " The soccer ball . " A solemn-looking fourteen-year-old boy standing nearby threw in a soccer ball . The still photographers took pictures of the foursome with the ball . " He " ? Fields broke loose from the huddle to gesture toward Pele ? " is a big ' Rocky ' fan . He 's a big ' Asphalt Jungle ' fan . " " You 'll have to teach inc how to stretch my arm up , " Stallone said to Pele , holding his right arm straight up over his head . " In ' Rocky II , ' I tore my right pectoral muscle . They had to drill a hole in a bone and tie the muscle through it . One hundred and fifty-six stitches . " " When Pele heard the story of the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only thing he wants is to make sure the soccer elements are accurate . We hope to get a top soccer coach to do the choreography  --  Bobby Robson , the manager of the Ipswich Town Football Club . " " We have to find out what kind of pants they wore in 1940 , " Stallone said . " Short pants , " Pelt said . " Short pants , " Huston said , giving it his own reading . " Now they wear shorter short pants , " Pele said . " Have you seen the indoor version ? " Stallone said . " It 's a lot rougher , " Fields said . " So fast , " PeIe. said . " I do n't get basketball , " Huston said . " They 're all six nine or six ten . " Everybody laughed . " And the scores are always one thirteen or one seventeen , " Huston said , leading the laughter . After a pause , Stallone said , " We 've got a fine script . We 're happy . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , with his laugh . Money ARTHUR T. RAND aspires to he the most altruistic fellow in town . O.K. , sure , he wants to take care of himself along the way  --  Arthur Rand is still in his pre-retirement years and he has day-to-day expenses and he likes to live it up occasionally  --  hut mainly he 's doing this for other people . Arthur Rand comes right out and says that he 's a people guy and a pro-America type of guy , who predicted correctly that silver was going to move and that colored gems were going to move . If you had been paying attention to what he says he was saying , and had invested your assets in silver and colored gems , which moved , instead of tying up everything in subway-token futures  --  in which case , face it , at thirteen per cent inflation you 're no better off than a mattress stuffer  --  then maybe now you 'd be about to move yourself to someplace like the west coast of Florida . Being an altruist , Arthur Rand charged only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just completed a four-day run at the New York Coliseum . Five dollars seems like a bargain when you consider the killing you can make if you just latch on to the right financial expert . Arthur Rand offered this bargain because he felt sorry for the people who did n't make it to the first Money Show , hack in the fall of 1978 . Actually , he also felt a little sorry for himself . There was a newspaper strike at the time of the first Money Show , so not that many people heard about it . These days , most of Arthur Rand 's assets are tied up in the whole Money Show concept . He promoted this exposition  --  one hundred and fifty exhibits , seventy " free seminars " ( once you 've paid your five bucks ) ? with his own money , nobody else 's , because twice in the past Arthur Rand lent money to certain individuals and got burned ; since then , he has learned his lesson . This time around , he had saturation news coverage on local television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance of fifty thousand and only twenty thousand came , that 's all right , too , because it means that there are an extra thirty thousand people out there who still need Arthur Rand 's help . The thing that you have to understand  --  and even if you do n't have a firm grasp of this principle when you walk into the Money Show , you have certainly got the idea by the time you leave  --  is this : everything is worth something . We 're not just talking about pork bellies , coffee , lumber , soybeans , gold , oil , diamonds , and A.T . &; T. We 're talking about Japanese Invasion Money banknotes from the Second World War , Bic Disposable Lighter vending machines , whole-wheat kernels in No. 10 galvanized cans and texturized vegetable protein and dehydrated cheddar cheese in No. 2Y2 galvanized cans , collectible plates with portraits of little Navajo children , the forty pounds of unsightly fat you shed before you set out on job interviews , your hair , and your teeth . Some people overlook items like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he brought in a dentist , Dr. Harry J. Chisling , to the Money Show to tell people to hold on to whatever is inside their mouths  --  the price is bound to go up . Now , it has occurred to Arthur Rand that there exists a potential for dishonesty in every enterprise  --  commodities , tax shelters , stocks and bonds , franchising arrangements . But he 's no fool and he does his best to keep shady elements out of the Money Show picture . Still , he reads the money magazines THE NEW YORKER 35 and he looks around at what 's going on these days and he just knows that people have money stashed away out there , and it seems truly disgusting to him how much they have . Arthur Rand calls this sort of money , the sort that 's hiding in corners , not actively looking for a decent home  --  Arthur Rand calls it " filthy . " He would like to volunteer to steer the worst of the filth in the proper direction , to see that it somehow gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he can pay some bills and tie up some loose ends and confirm his reservation for another four days at the Coliseum , he 's going to do the only proper thing and start making plans for another Money Show . Science Talent " M Y project was a math project on the partition function , which counts how many ways a number can be expressed as sums of other numbers , or summands . I formulated a Iaw that governs the growth of the number of partitions of a number into restricted sets of summands  --  this can quickly grow to more than fifty-four digits  --  as the number grows , without bound , " said Brian Greene , one of eleven New York City-area winners of the thirty-ninth annual Westinghouse Science Talent Search  --  the nation 's largest high-school science-scholarship program  --  to the people assembled at a reception in the St. Regis Hotel honoring the winners , their parents , and their teachers . Besides being interested in math , Brian enjoys competing in wrestling and cross-country for Stuyvesant High School . Among his other hobbies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Alan Greene , of Manhattan . " I worked with leeches to find out why red blood cells , which live for only four months in a human being , live for eighteen months in the gut of the leech , and I isolated a bacterium from the gut of the leech which eliminates hemolytic bacteria  --  bacteria that destroy red blood cells  --  before the hemolytic bacteria can do any damage to the cells , and I 'd like to thank everybody from Benjamin Cardozo High ! " said Naomi Taylor , another winner , to the cheers of the group from Cardozo Naomi is the captain of her school math team ; her favorite subjects are biology , calculus , and English ; and she is on a Y.M.C.A. swim team . She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alvin Taylor , of Baysicle . " This is one of the nicest parts of my job . The press kit ought to tell you all you need to know , " Roy L. Morrow , a press agent for Westinghouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park Avenue , and his title is Manager , Media Relations , Westinghouse Electric Corporation . Roy is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Roy W. Morrow , of Pittsburgh . The Westinghouse Science Talent Search was begun in 1942 . An organization called Science Service selects the winners , and the Westinghouse Corporation provides an annual total of eighty-nine thousand five hundred dollars in prize money . The Westinghouse Corporation was founded in 1886 by George Westinghouse . A tireless inventor , George patented the railroad air brake and pioneered the development of the practical use of alterrutting current . He was one of the first employers to give workers a half day off on Saturdays . George was the son of Mr. and Mrs. George Westinghouse , Sr. , of Central Bridge , New York . In the past , several winners of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search hare gone on to win Nobel Prizes . More famous than any of the Science Talent Search Nobelists was Albert Einstein , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 , Albert 's theories of relativity , which provided a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation of modern nuclear physics . In addition to science , Albert enjoyed philosophy and playing the violin . Albert was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Hermann Einstein , of Ulm , Germany . The Nobel Prizes , first awarded in 1901 , were established by Alfred Nobel to reward outstanding achievements in the sciences , literature , and peace . Keenly interested in explosives , Alfred made his fortune with the invention of dynamite . Alfred was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Immanuel Nobel , Jr. , of Stockholm , Sweden .
