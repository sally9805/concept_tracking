Mr. Stewart ' s responses were an out-of-court settlement and a phenomenally successful album called " Blondes Have More Fun " - the title referred to his penchant for blondes , from Miss Ekland to Alana Hamilton , the actress he married in 1978 . The album included a song called " Da Ya Think I ' m Sexy ? " that became a huge international hit but was also a fall from rock-and-roll grace into the banal shallows of disco . It was seized on by Mr. Stewart ' s detractors as proof that his songwriting had deteriorated markedly since the early and middle 70 ' s , when he wrote or co-wrote " Maggie May , " " Tonight ' s the Night , " and several other songs that were artistic triumphs as well as commercial successes. // But like the Rolling Stones , who bounced back this year with a superb new album and an American tour that has been garnering enthusiastic reviews at almost every stop , Mr. Stewart seems to have found his second wind .

When he visited New York recently to perform on " Saturday Night Live , " he brought along the most impressive band he has ever led . And he readily , if somewhat ruefully , admitted that these improvements were a response to what many of his fans had recognized as a deterioration in the quality of his work. // When he was asked about " Da Ya Think I ' m Sexy ? " Mr. Stewart grimaced . " A lot of us got taken in by disco , " he said . " I drifted further and further away from rock-and-roll , in my music and in the way I was living.

His music had put him on the cover of Rolling Stone in the early 70 ' s ; his celebrity status put him on the cover of People Magazine in 1979 . He has drastically cut back on his drinking since then . And according to his wife , " We hardly ever go out now . We ' d rather stay at home. " // In New York , the Stewarts got around more . The night before his performance on " Saturday Night Live , " Mr. Stewart visited the Ritz to hear Tina Turner , who donned a thatch of blond , ersatz hair - a Rod Stewart look-alike wig - and sang several of his songs . On the spur of the moment , he invited Miss Turner to sing a duet with him on " Saturday Night Live . " The song , " Hot Legs , " was a frothy piece of self-delectation the way Mr. Stewart and his band of the late 70 ' s performed it .

" <> <> Two Other Ingredients // Later still , during an early-morning conversation at the midtown hotel where the Stewarts were staying , Mr. Stewart amended that statement . " Musically , " he said , " what you also need to make good rock-and-roll is a good bass player and drummer . " He has them in the bassist Jay Davis and the newly recruited drummer Tony Brock . In the past , Mr. Stewart ' s bands tended to overplay sometimes to the point of unintentional parody . His present group is rhythmically assured , well-stocked with inventive soloists , and notably lacking in inflated egos. // " Tonight I ' m Yours , " Mr. Stewart ' s new album , is equally winning , and it manages , directly or indirectly , to allude to virtually every phase of his varied musical career . First , he was a folk singer , then an early star of the mid-60 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jeff Beck group , then lead vocalist with the lively and sometimes chaotic Faces . During his years as a Face ( 1969-1976 ) , he also recorded a number of albums under his own name , and he seemed to save the best of the songs he was writing and co-writing for these albums . When his longtime friend and song-writing partner Ron Wood left the Faces to become a Rolling Stone in 1976 , the group disbanded , and Mr. Stewart put together the first band he could call his own. // On " Tonight I ' m Yours , " these phases are recalled by a song , an arrangement , a vocal ornament , or a fragment of a lyric . And Mr. Stewart ' s determination to build his bands around three electric guitarists , a formula he has followed since the demise of the Faces despite the tendency of guitar-heavy bands to indulge in excess , has finally born fruit . Each of the three guitarists who works with him now can do a number of things well , but all three seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Characterization in Lyrics // Traces of disco rhythms linger in Mr. Stewart ' s music , but in the songs " Tonight I ' m Yours , " and " Young Turks , " he and his band have bred an ingenious hybrid from disco ' s evenly pulsating eighthnotes and the more syncopated rock-and-rhythms first popularized by Chuck Berry in the 1950 ' s . " Young Turks , " which is the first song from the album to be released as a single , is Mr. Stewart ' s account of a young couple who run away from their homes , head for the West Coast , move into " a two-room apartment that was jumping every night of the week , " and live happily ever after . The lyrics casually drop details that make the two protagonists come alive as individuals . Mr. Stewart has often been a wonderfully vivid lyricist , but in " Young Turks " he outdoes himself . The lyrics of " Tonight I ' m Yours " are more predictable , but the song sports an attractive melody and momentum and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stewart ' s renewed commitment to making first-rate rock-and-roll . " Only a Boy " is a still-life from the singer ' s last day as a schoolboy , which was also the day he decided to make rock-and-roll his life . " Tora , Tora , Tora " is a wildly careening celebration of the rock-and-roll life - life on the road. // Mr. Stewart will be back on the road Nov. 11 , when he begins a four-month tour of the United States and Canada . He will be at Madison Square Garden on Thanksgiving Night and on Dec. 18 his performance at the Los Angeles Forum will be televised worldwide , and simulcast on FM radio , via satellite hook-ups . The ad hoc network that has been created for the show will reach 85 percent of the television-owning homes in the United States and milions more around the world - the largest potential audience any rock singer has gone after since Elvis Presley ' s ground-breaking , satellite-transmitted " Live From Hawaii.

" What I ' m really looking forward to is getting back on the road with the boys , " he said . " I guess that ' s kind of adolescent . " He stirred the drink he had been carefully nursing and grinned . " But I can hardly wait . " <> <> A Gentleman in Private // The Stewarts seem happily married , with a relationship grounded in mutual respect ; despite his reputation as a womanizer and the " loveem and leave-em " flippancy that still crops up in some of his lyrics , in private Mr. Stewart is gentlemanly and seems genuinely attentive . But not even life in a mansion with Alana , or for that matter the life of a Hollywood celebrity that he was living with a vengeance a few years ago , have dulled his appetite for the roughand-tumble of a rock-and-roll tour. // One suspects that this all-but-uncontrollable urge to go barnstorming from city to city , hitting stage after stage to the roar of thousands of fans and the clammer of superamplified drums and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockers - the performers for whom rock-and-roll is not just a medium but a calling - from the entertainers , who happen to be using an accessible popular idiom . Rod Stewart is a rocker . For a while he was a lapsed rocker , but with his new band , his new attitude , and " Tonight I ' m Yours , " he has returned to the fold. //
