The tone of the annual provincial leaders conference taking place in Halifax , Nova Scotia was set by a document issued there by the provincial government of Alberta declaring that an " unnecessary crisis of confidence permeates the Canadian economy and that the federal Government is to blame. " // It said that the worldwide recession has had an impact , but that the Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau had a greater responsibility . Specifically , it said " punishing " high interest rates and business taxes and restrictions on foreign investment and energy policies were hampering prospects for economic recovery. // The booklet , which bore the imprint of Edgar Peter Lougheed , Alberta ' s politically ambitious Premier , called for the suspension for two years of the Foreign Investment Review Agency . The agency decides whether the foreign direction of companies operating here is in Canada ' s best interests . Critics of the legislation say that it has intimidated foreigners from committing capital here , thus costing jobs . <> <> ' An Insidious Impediment ' // A number of other premiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Premier John Buchanan of Nova Scotia , the host for the conference , called the act " an insidious impediment to investment. " // William R. Bennett , Premier of British Columbia , said it was " hogwash " to say , as the Government does , that the act is needed to prevent the foreign takeover of Canadian industry since laws aleady exist to control the conduct of foreign companies . Premier Rene Levesque of Quebec said in his province , foreign-owned companies have been better corporate citizens than have Canadian companies. // The pronouncements were the latest in a series of skirmishes placing the premiers against the Government of Prime Minister Trudeau , who has vacillated between cooperation and confrontation with the provincial leaders. // At the moment , the paramount issue for Mr. Trudeau is the rallying of support for his so-called five and six program , which seeks to have wage increases in both the public and private sector limited to five percent this year and six percent in 1983 . A number of politicians in Halifax and here in the capital suggested this week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trudeau were to back off from his position on foreign investments and gradual " Canadianization " of the energy companies . <> <> Major Employers Comply // Within the last month , after Parliament bound federal employees within the terms of the wage formula , news conferences were held almost daily in Ottawa to announce compliance by such major employers as telephone and transport companies . As described by Mr. Trudeau ' s aides the program was fully voluntary , but at the same time , the participating companies were clearly the ones most dependent on Government grants or vulnerable to pressure within this economy , where private and public sectors are more intertwined than in the United States. // Allan Joseph MacEachen , the Minister of Finance , traveled to Halifax early this week in an effort to persuade Mr. Buchanan , the Nova Scotia Premier , to urge his counterparts to endorse the five and six concept for their provincial civil servants and for the private sector within their regions . Mr. MacEachen has very little political power with the provincial premiers , none of whom are from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , policies and party of Mr. Trudeau for Canada ' s economic plight . <> <> Wage Plan Assailed // The political strategy they appear to have adopted is to contend that the voluntary limitation on wage increases may be needed , but that without other restraints it is an ineffective measure. // While the premiers met , Michael Wilson , the spokesman on finance for the Progessive Conservative Party opposition , said at a news conference that the Government ' s emphasis on the " five and six was a diversion . " He added , " We have always felt that a Government restraint program must include changes in the Foreign Investment Review Act , changes in the national energy policy , changes to reduce the size of the national deficit. " // Partisan considerations underlay the criticism in Halifax and Ottawa . Mr. Trudeau , who except for an eight-month hiatus has led Canada for 16 years , is at the nadir of his popularity . As unemployment and interest rates have risen , his standing in opinion polls has plummeted to a point where a scant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inflation rate stands at 10. 8 percent , the jobless rate is nudging 11 percent and the prime interest rate is now 16 percent . <> <> Liberals Defend Plan // The Liberals say the economic situation was not a result of misguided policies but a consequence of the world recession , most particularly of the economic reversals in the United States , the market for about two-thirds of Canada ' s exports . They defend their Canadianization programs like the Foreign Investment Review Act and the energy program , saying that in time , such provisions will disengage the country ' s economy from that of the United States , making it more autonomous. // Opposition critics deplore the limits on foreign investments in general and regard the carrying out of these policies at a time of growing unemployment as particularly counterproductive . But in private , some of them concede that like the five and six program , the foreign investment issue is a bugbear that , even if resolved to their satisfaction , could only marginally affect the economy. //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
