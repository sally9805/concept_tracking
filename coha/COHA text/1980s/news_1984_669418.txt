Robert Mumford , the civil defense official , was trying to update evacuation plans for the southeastern Georgia county . ' ' They ( Union Carbide officials ) said we handle chlorine , ' ' Mr. Mumford recalls . Chlorine gas is poisonous. // But plant officials did not mention that they used the same deadly gas that later leaked in India , according to Mumford . He says he first learned the plant used the same gas when he read an article in a newspaper after the leak at the Union Carbide plant in India , which led to the deaths of at least 2 , 000 people and serious injuries to thousands more. // No other county official contacted by this newspaper was aware that the same gas was being used at the plant . Consequently , no evacuation plans were ever drawn up by the county in the event of a gas leak at the plant , county officials say. // After the Dec. 3 leak from the plant in Bhopal , India , a Union Carbide spokesman at the company ' s headquarters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isocyanate , was normally shipped from the company ' s plant at Institute , W.Va. , to the Georgia plant . ( Those shipments were halted after the gas leak in India , until more was known about what caused the leak , the spokesman added ) . // ' ' If the thing ( the gas leak in India ) hadn ' t happened over there , I don ' t think this would have come up ( public knowledge that the Georgia plant used the same gas ) , ' ' Mumford says. // Local officials and representatives of the Union Carbide plant in Georgia have met since the India leak to begin preparing evacuation plans for the area in the event of a leak of the gas at the plant , according to county officials there. // ' ' One thing they ( Union Carbide officials ) admitted to us ( was that ) they ' d been lax in their planning ' ' regarding evacuation of nearby communties , says Kenneth Gay , chairman of the Camden County board of commissioners. // Methyl isocyanate gas has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertrand , employee-relations manager at the plant . The plant , which employs about 600 people , has had an evacuation plan for its employees , he said . Now a coordinated emergency evacuation plan for people in the area is being prepared with local officials for Camden and nearby counties , he added . The company meets all federal safety requirements for storage and transportation of the gas , he said. // Mr. Bertrand said he thought Camden County Sheriff James Middleton might have known of the existence of the gas used at the plant . Sheriff Middleton could not be reached. // The previous lack of public knowledge of the existence of a deadly gas at the plant raises several questions : // // * Should companies be required by law to notify local officials that hazardous chemicals are used at their local plants ? // ' ' Workers in plants have a right to know what they ' re working with , and members of the general public have a right to know what ' s in facilities where they live , ' ' says Vicki Bremen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Georgia legislature is studying both points , she says. // // * What safety requirements are in effect regarding shipment of such materials ? Union Carbide has been shipping the gas by truck from West Virginia to southeastern Georgia . Should public officials , especially in major population centers along transportation routes of hazardous chemicals , be notifed of such shipments ? What emergency response plans are in effect in the event of spills along the way ? // // * Camden County clerk John Peterson , who lives a few miles from the plant and just a quarter of a mile from the truck route to the plant , asks : If there is a leak , how far might the gas be dispersed ? Is the gas pressurized or in liquid form ? ' ' I think the things concerning the people are the response time of emergency teams , ' ' he adds. // // * Finally , are some chemicals just too dangerous to use ? // Danny Daniels , director of emergency services for Camden County , says : ' ' I think from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the amount of stuff we ' re producing and cut back. ' ' // He says he is unaware of any antidote to use in the event of a methyl isocyanate gas leak . And his emergency instructions for response to such a leak call for clearing the area for half a mile , although the gas cloud in India apparently affected people for several miles downwind. // As for length of response time to a gas leak , Mr. Daniels says no plans were ever drawn up for such a response . Previously he did not know specifically which gas was being used at the plant , although he knew an ' ' extremely dangerous ' ' gas was being used there in addition to chlorine , he says. // For emergency officials to stay informed of all the many hazardous chemicals being shipped through and used in a county is no easy task , especially in a county with a low population , he says. // Daniels says he and a county fire official recently participated in a firefighting training program offered by Union Carbide in Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says. // ' ' I ' m more concerned about the amount of chlorine ' ' than methyl isocyanate used in the county , he says . A local paper company uses much more of it than Union Carbide , he added. // The Union Carbide plant in Camden County is located in a sparsely populated area . The nearest community is Harriett ' s Bluff , some three or four miles away , says county clerk Peterson . It has a maximum of about 300 residents at its summer peak , he says. // ' ' I think there ' s been pretty much a feeling of security within the community because a number of ( plant employees ) live there , ' ' says Peterson . He says he does not believe that a lack of public knowledge of the use of the deadly gas was ' ' an attempt to keep anything secret. ' ' // County official Gay says of Union Carbide ' s plant : ' ' It ' s about as safe a plant as you can have . I ' m personally not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' We ' re sitting on a bomb , it looks like. ' ' // ' ' We didn ' t realize the effect of this particular ( gas ) , ' ' he says . He adds that he was unaware that the gas was being used at the plant. // What the area needs now , say local officials , is some kind of clear signal that would call for evacution in the event of a gas leak , and a planned evacuation . And campers and other visitors to the Cumberland Island National Seashore , close to the plant , would need to be alerted in such an event , he says. // //
