CITIZENS : A CHRONICLE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION by Simon Schama <P> Knopf ; 948 pages ; $29.95 <P> This extraordinary history of the French Revolution begins with a three- story-high plaster elephant standing guard in the Place de la Bastille . Commissioned by the triumphant Emperor Napoleon , eventually to be recast in the bronze of captured cannons , the elephant was designed to make Parisians forget their revolutionary past and dream of an imperial future . Its real destiny  --  like the question of what to remember  --  proved quite different . " By 1830 , when revolution revisited Paris , the elephant was in an advanced state of decomposition , " writes Harvard historian Simon Schama . " One tusk had dropped off , and the other was reduced to a powdery stump . Its body was black from rain and soot and its eyes had sunk , beyond all natural resemblance , into the furrows and pockmarks of its large , eroded head . " <P> Such a grand beginning inspires confidence that we are in the hands of a master storyteller , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saga of revolt and revenge may at first seem somewhat familiar , for it has long been one of the great narrative legends of modern time , told and retold by Burke , Tocqueville , Carlyle and others . We already know  --  do n't we ?  --  about the dim-witted King Louis XVI , about Queen Marie Antoinette 's supposedly saying " Let them eat cake , " and the ragged mobs cheering as the bloodied guillotine rises and falls in its awful rhythm of retribution . <P> Schama 's splendid recounting soon convinces us , however , that much of what we thought we knew is wrong , a collection of Hollywood versions of 19th century romances : Leslie Howard as " that demmed elusive Pimpernel , " or Ronald Colman doing a " far , far better thing " by accepting the fate prescribed by Dickens in A Tale of Two Cities . Schama 's reality is very different from the legends . <P> For example , the famous storming of the Bastille prison  --  of which the French are noisily celebrating the 200th anniversary this summer  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-supplied defenders ( whose oppressed prisoners consisted of just two lunatics , four forgers and one aristocratic ne'er-do-well put away by his family ) finally surrendered when they saw themselves confronting the rioters ' artillery , which included a silver-inlaid cannon originally given to France by the King of Siam . And the commandant of the Bastille , who had tried to avoid further bloodshed , was subsequently hacked to death , his head stuck on a pike and paraded through the streets . <P> This reassembling and rearranging of historical detail is brilliantly successful : Schama 's tale is vivid , dramatic , thought-provoking . Yet such is the current academic vogue for bloodless and pseudoscientific historiography that the author repeatedly feels a need to apologize for what he somewhat disingenuously calls a " mischievously old-fashioned piece of storytelling . " If Schama 's portrait of the revolution is often surprising in its closeup details , however , it is no less so in coloring the background imagery of the French society being overturned .                @ @ @ @ @
