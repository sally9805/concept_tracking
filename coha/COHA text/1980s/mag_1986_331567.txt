The loss was the largest ever suffered by a U.S. financial institution . But the victim was not a big-city bank with billions of dollars on loan to Mexico and Brazil .

's 1985 deficit of $2.7 billion , reported last week , far surpassed the record $1.08 billion loss suffered by Continental Illinois bank in 1984 . <P> The cause of the F.C.S. 's red ink is no mystery : the farm belt continues to suffer from its worst depression since the 1930s . Squeezed between low crop prices and falling land values , many farmers are sinking deeper and deeper into debt . By the end of 1985 borrowers were unable to make either interest or principal payments on $5.3 billion in F.C.S. loans , or 8% of its $66.6 billion portfolio . <P> Even so , the F.C.S. is in no danger of going bankrupt . It has a $3 billion reserve fund to cover further losses in 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrysler in seeking a federal bailout . In December Congress passed a law designed to keep the supply of farm credit flowing by clearing the way for the F.C.S. to borrow money from the Government if necessary .
