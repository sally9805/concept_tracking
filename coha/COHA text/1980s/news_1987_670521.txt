The astronomers believe that this mysterious cluster , which they call a " Great Attractor , " explains the surprising recent discovery that a portion of the universe appears to be moving in concert rather than flying apart , as long assumed. // According to one of the scientists , Sandra M. Faber of the University of California ' s Lick Observatory , galaxies and smaller clusters are being pulled toward this megacluster from all sides . Yet because the phenomenon is occurring on such a gigantic scale , from the vantage point of Earth it appears that the Milky Way and neighboring galaxies are " streaming " together in a single direction . <> <> Theory on ' Great Attractor ' // In a recent telephone interview , Dr. Faber said she suspected that the attractor might be a concentration of galaxies at a junction between vast sheets or filaments along which the visible material of the universe seems to be distributed. // The findings of that group were presented last week at a symposium of the American Physical Society on " Dark Matter and the Large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 percent of the universe is believed to consist of " dark matter , " invisible material whose composition is unknown. // Incomplete mapping of the cosmos has shown the galaxies holding its visible matter to be distributed in networks of bubbles , sheets or filaments . But it was evident at last week ' s meeting , in Crystal City , Va. , that astrophysicists remain far from agreement on how those structures evolved from a universe that in its infancy was extremely uniform and homogeneous. // The discovery of the " Great Attractor " may clear up one mystery . Astronomers had long assumed that galaxies forming the visible matter of the universe were flying apart in a uniform manner as the universe expands . But in 1982 , they discovered that the Milky Way and its neighbors were moving together , relative to the entire universe . Many assumed they were " falling " toward one of the largest accumulations of matter , the Virgo Cluster of some 2 , 500 galaxies. // But more recently a group of seven astronomers reported that a far larger number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster of galaxies , are all streaming in a single direction. // Last week one of the seven , Dr. Alan Dressler of the Mount Wilson and Las Campanas Observatories , told the physics meeting that the " Great Attractor " drawing them had been identified. // It is an extraordinary concentration of galaxies 3. 5 times farther away than the Virgo Cluster and 15 to 30 times more massive . In addition to Dr. Faber , other astronomers in the group were from Arizona State University , Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona , the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge and the Royal Greenwich Observatory , both in England , and Dartmouth College. // Evidence for a concentration of quasars in the same general direction as the " Great Attractor " was reported in the April 23 issue of Nature by P.A. Shaver of the European Southern Observatory. // The discovery that clusters form part of structures spanning large portions of the visible universe has challenged straightforward concepts of how the universe evolved . Dr. Neil Turok of Imperial College , London , argued at the physics meeting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe for gravitational effects to have produced such enormous structures from a homogeneous beginning. // He proposed that the structures evolved along " cosmic strings " remaining from an early stage in the formation of the universe . Such hypothetical strings would have spanned the early universe , drawing material to themselves to form very long structures. // Further evidence that the universe , in its infancy , was devoid of lumpiness was presented by Dr. David T. Wilkinson of Princeton University . He described observations of the " glow " in the microwave part of the radio spectrum that fills the entire sky , which is thought to be a remnant of the early stages of the theoretical Big Bang that led to the birth of the universe. // When this glow is recorded in different directions , motion of Earth and nearby galaxies toward the Great Attractor alters its intensity , much as one can detect motion from the wind in one ' s face . But so far detailed scanning has shown no lack of uniformity in the glow that would suggest incipient concentrations of material. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from a number of radio observatories including the Very Large Array in New Mexico . Recently a group from A.T. &; T. Bell Laboratories scanned the heavens at the South Pole station. // While no lumpiness was observed , Dr. Wilkinson said that within about one year better sensors successively scanning small patches of sky should begin to show the birth of formations . <> <> Clues on Early Structures // The results could show whether the first structures were huge , later breaking up into galaxies , or whether galaxies came first , then grouped themselves into ever larger assemblies . More precise mapping should also resolve whether the voids are closed spheres or , as some believe , interconnected in spongelike manner. // Dr. Leonid M. Ozernoy of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , which has mapped parts of the cosmos in three dimensions , said the maps show the galaxies " crowded " into spaces forming only 10 percent of the universe . The remaining 90 percent is almost empty , forming voids , some of which are more than 100 million light years wide. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas pointed out that in an expanding universe dense areas are held back from expanding by their gravity whereas less dense ones expand more readily into voids . Others said the voids were blown out by chains of stellar explosions , like strings of gigantic firecrackers. // As noted by Dr. Vera C. Rubin of the Carnegie Institution , early evidence for invisible matter was ignored . In the early 1930 ' s Dr. Jan Oort of the Netherlands found that stars above and below the disk of the Milky Way are moving under the control of gravity twice as strong as that expected from the known stars , gas and dust clouds of the galaxy itself . <> <> Search for ' Missing ' Material // Evidence that material is also " missing " elsewhere was discovered in the 1930 ' s . Galaxies within galactic clusters were found to be moving so fast that they would long ago have flown off into space unless there is 10 or 20 times more gravity holding the cluster together than can be explained by visible material. // Even more " dark matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe , put forward a few years ago by Alan H. Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . It postulates a stage of extremely rapid inflation , following the Big Bang , from which emerged a universe containing just enough matter to prevent eternal expansion . This , Dr. Rubin pointed out , would require 99 times more material than can be seen. // At the meeting various hypothetical forms of such material were discussed . Because neutrinos , the most elusive of subatomic particles , are believed to be by far the most abundant constituents of the universe , if they had a small amount of mass they could account for some or all of the unseen matter. // But observations of a neutrino burst from the recent supernova in a nearby galaxy indicate that neutrinos of the type associated with electrons have so little mass they are unlikely to play a major role . But neutrinos come in two other forms that may be more massive. // At the meeting more attention was paid to forms of matter which , unlike neutrinos , would not be moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include a variety of particles predicted by theories now going the rounds . None have been directly observed . Nevertheless , Dr. Floyd W. Stecker of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center cited hints for the existence of one group of candidates : Wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) postulated by so-called supersymmetry theory . They should annihilate one another when they meet , producing antiprotons ( negatively charged protons ) . // Dr. Rubin said all arguments for large amounts of dark matter assume that Newton ' s theory of gravity ( with modifications by Einstein ) applies throughout the universe. // While some physicists are investigating the possibility that gravity works differently far away , she said , " most astronomers and physicists prefer to leave Newton alone " and lay the blame on dark matter. //
