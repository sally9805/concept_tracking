Ozone pollution is different from the ozone layer that shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays . Ozone is a highly reactive form of oxygen , and ozone smog is formed when pollutants such as emissions from autos and house paint interact with heat and sunlight. // This smog is now one of New England ' s most serious air pollution problems . Last year , nine of the 14 ozone monitors in Massachusetts recorded violations of the national air quality health standard , which medical research has indicated may not even be strict enough to protect public health. // // Major cities across the country are similarly afflicted , with California registering the worst level of ozone smog . In New England , Michael Deland , regional administrator for the New England branch of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , says it is the only pollutant that still exceeds the standard. // In order to force reductions in ozone pollution , the Conservation Law Foundation ( CLF ) , a nonprofit regional environmental group , has sued the EPA and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from harmful smog. // CLF attorney Cleve Livingston believes the outcome could determine how the EPA deals with all areas that don ' t meet the federal ozone standard . Both the CLF and EPA feel the suit will focus attention on what has become a national issue and force the EPA into action. // ' ' It ' s an ongoing current health threat that needs to be taken seriously , but one which the public is not really aware of , ' ' says Mr. Deland . But , the problem is hard to solve because it is ' ' a function of how and where we live , ' ' explains Laurel Jenney Carlson , the chief program developer for Massachusetts ' division of air quality. // Painting a house , driving a car and taking it to the auto body shop , open burning , and using asphalt or home boilers all contribute to ozone pollution . And while changing the way people live down to such detail may seem difficult , ' ' it ' s not impossible , ' ' says Ms. Carlson. // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' will test the commitment of the environmental movement in a fashion it has not been tested to date , on an individual level. ' ' // Health officials say that , when breathed , this smog can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems . Summer ozone can pose a potential health risk to 2 million people in the Northeast. // Like acid rain , ozone is corrosive . In remote areas , it has contributed to the decline of forests , says Dr. Michael Oppenheimer , senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund. // In a study of its white pines , Acadia National Park in Bar Harbor , Maine , discovered that 58 percent of the 750 trees tested showed yellowing , a symptom of ozone injury , says Mary Foley , a forest ecologist . Carroll Shell , a research management specialist at Acadia , commented that very few people dispute a connection to ozone pollution. // With the passage of the Clean Air Act , the EPA attempted to set a national air quality standard for ozone . The law requires states to develop plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The deadline for reaching the standard is Dec. 31 , 1987 , and includes sanctions to be imposed on states that fail to submit adequate plans or to implement their plans. // These sanctions include a moratorium on construction of stationary sources of pollutants , such as gasoline pumps , power plants , and factories , and denial of Clean Air Act planning grants , federal highway construction funds , and sewage treatment plant construction funds. // In the suit , the CLF contends that Massachusetts failed to revise its plan when it became apparent that it was inadequate to meet the 1987 deadline . The state ' ' is required to go back to the drawing board if its plans do not work , ' ' CLF attorney Livingston explains. // The EPA is included in the suit because it failed to force the state to produce a feasible pollution control plan , and did not impose any of the outlined sanctions when Massachusetts did not make a revision. // The CLF accuses both the EPA and division of air quality of having put the blame on other states. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as frustrated with EPA as the environmental groups , ' ' Bruce Maillet , the head of Massachusetts ' air quality division , was quoted as saying in a recent Boston Globe article. // While Deland of the EPA agrees that the CLF ' s accusations are basically correct , he disagrees that Massachusetts is totally to blame . ' ' In fact , ' ' he says , ' ' Massachusetts is further ahead than many of the other states . ' ' Pennsylvania is so far doing less to control ozone smog , he says. // ' ' Massachusetts ' problem is being effectively exacerbated by other states ' emissions , ' ' argues Deland . ' ' It ' s a lot like acid rain , ' ' says Carlson of Massachusetts ' division of air quality . ' ' No state is immune. ' ' // The whole Northeast corridor is affected by ozone smog , and the ultimate solution , Deland stresses , lies with all of the Northeast states . By 1987 , the whole East Coast will be in violation of the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution that is carried up the East Coast on the winds. // The division of air quality reports that the worst ozone problems occur when winds from the southeast are blowing pollution in from the New York metropolitan area. // Carlson believes that overcoming this problem is feasible , and points out that past efforts have been somewhat successful. // ' ' Our records in Boston show a definite decrease in ozone , which can be attributed in large part to our reduction techniques , ' ' she says. // Massachusetts has reduced emmissions by 50 percent over a six-year period . But states have a long way to go to reach their goals. // Since 1975 , state and federal governments have been working to reduce the amount of ozone-forming pollutants . Because some of these ' precursor pollutants , ' as they are called , are themselves toxic , by controlling them , not only has ozone pollution been reduced , but multiple health benefits can also be seen. // But ' ' states are still trying to determine what steps will be worthwhile , ' ' says Carlson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chemical industry , and controls on smaller industries are all under review . The smaller the industry , the harder it is to impose controls. // //
