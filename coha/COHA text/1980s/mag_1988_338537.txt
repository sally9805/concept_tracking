Willie Horton was supposed to be serving time for murder in Massachusetts in April 1986 when he invaded a home in Oxon Hill , Md. , raped a woman and stabbed her companion . Horton had not broken out of prison . He had walked away from it ten months earlier while on a weekend furlough , an experiment that has been a cornerstone of Governor Michael Dukakis ' criminal-justice program . <P> Now the Horton case is being used to paint Dukakis with that most damaging ) liberal stereotype : soft on crime . George Bush has taken to citing his differences with the Governor by saying , " I do n't like the idea of letting murderers out of jail . " One G.O.P. strategist has proposed a bumper sticker reading , DUKAKIS TO RAPIST : HAVE A NICE WEEKEND . <P> Responding to public outrage over the Horton incident , Dukakis signed a new law last April banning furloughs for first-degree murderers . Explaining his turnaround , Dukakis said simply , " I try to listen , I try to learn . " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During a debate in San Francisco , conservative Journalist John McLaughlin charged that Massachusetts ' program allowed convicts to commit more violent crimes . " That 's not true , " Dukakis exclaimed . " That happened on one occasion . " <P> Although Dukakis was considered too liberal on crime during his first term , he has worked hard to reverse that image . In the past four years , the violent- crime rate in Massachusetts has dropped 13.4% while the national rate has risen 1.8% . Today the state has the lowest homicide rate of any major industrial state in the country . In 1983 Dukakis formed a special anticrime task council , and he has chaired every one of the group 's 58 meetings . " His record against crime now ca n't be disputed , " says Ned Merrick , legislative representative of the state 's police association . " It 's too good . " <P> Yet the furlough furor threatens to overshadow these impressive achievements . Massachusetts is among 45 states that allow prison leaves . Last fall state legislators published a report lambasting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not properly screened Horton before his leaves , investigators found , and they did not keep thorough records of his behavior in the prison . <P> Defenders of furlough programs point out that weekend leaves offer relief at a time when prisons around the country are dangerously overcrowded . Behavior during furloughs can help determine how an inmate up for parole might function in society . According to John Larivee , executive director of Boston 's Crime and Justice Foundation , the recidivism rate since 1972 has been just 10% for prisoners paroled after taking part in such a program . Among other prisoners , it was 25% . <P> Moreover , there were only 426 escapees among the 117,786 furloughs during the same period , and Horton 's escape was the first among first-degree murderers from the program in nearly five years . " The failure was not the program , " says Massachusetts Corrections Commissioner Michael Fair . " Willie Horton was the failure . Our evidence is the program was successful .
