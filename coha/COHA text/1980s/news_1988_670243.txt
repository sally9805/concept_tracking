A recent display ad in this newspaper described an appealing new mutual fund . After reading the copy through twice , I decided to find out more about the fund . There was a coupon to be mailed for further information , or , if the reader preferred , an 800 number . After I dialed the 800 number , a woman answers . " I am calling about your ad in today ' s Wall Street Journal . I would like more information on your new fund . " " Are you calling about a bond fund or a stock fund ? " the woman asks . " I ' m calling about your ad in today ' s Journal  --  the new fund described there . " " Are you calling about a bond fund or a stock fund . I can ' t help you unless you tell me which . " " Well , it appears to be a stock fund . " No human response . However , the sounds of telephone switching gear are heard clicking , and in a half-minute another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I help you ? " " Yes , Linda , I am calling about the new fund you have advertised in today ' s Journal . Could you tell me  --  " " What is your zip code ? " " I ' m not sure you ' ll need my zip code . I don ' t know yet whether I want you to send me a prospectus . All I want is to ask a couple of questions about the fund . " " I ' ll have to have your zip code , " says Linda . She now has my zip code and I resume my quest for information . " What I would like to know , " I say , " is whether  --  " " Give me your name , " she cuts in . " Last name first , then first name , then middle initial , if any . Begin by spelling your last name . " Further recital of my discussion with Linda is unnecessary . Suffice it to say she never got my name ( first , last or middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after ; and Linda ' s company will never have me for a customer . The point of this anecdote has absolutely nothing to do with poor Linda . She was doing her job exactly as she believed it should be done . She correctly surmised that at the end of the day her work performance would be judged on a single factor : The completeness and accuracy of the computer printout she turned in , with each caller ' s zip code entered on the first line and his last name on the second line . Rather , the moral of the story is this : No matter how good the product or how brilliant the marketing plan , it all comes to naught if there is a breakdown at the most critical interface in all of business  --  the point at which the customer comes in contact with the company . Some executives never seem to grasp this precept . They assume that the task of attracting customers is strictly a responsibility of the sales department . Managers of successful organizations , however , recognize that each employee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptionist or a parts clerk , personifies the company when he or she comes in contact with a customer . When an IBM technician shows up to repair a typewriter or replace an electronic board , in the eyes of the customer that technician is IBM while he remains on the customer ' s premises . It is no mere happenstance , then , that IBM technicians , in addition to being skilled in their special area of expertise , are also usually solicitous of customer needs and concerns . They have been trained to be sensitive to the nuances of customer worries . In his book " Further Up the Organization , " former Avis President Robert Townsend writes : " When you ' re off on a business trip or a vacation , pretend you ' re a customer . Telephone some part of your organization and ask for help . You ' ll run into some real horror shows . " Good advice . A friend of mine who is marketing vice president of a major bank decided to follow Mr. Townsend ' s suggestion . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on an extension line ) to inquire about obtaining an automobile loan . " It was terrible , " he says . " We are a bank . Making loans is our business , and auto loans are very profitable . But the woman who made the call to ask about borrowing money for the purchase of a new car was treated with thinly veiled disdain at every step along the way . " I don ' t mind telling you , " my banker friend fumed , " that if I had been the prospective customer making the call , and had been treated as that woman was treated , I would have taken my business elsewhere . . . . We ' ve got some serious attitude-changing work ahead of us . " Satisfied customers represent the principal intangible asset of any company , regardless of its products or services . Every working day there are scores of situations in which customers interface with people in the company , from the president on down to the newest file clerk . Above all else , the manner in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company.  --  - Mr. Upton is a trade association consultant in Tulsa.
