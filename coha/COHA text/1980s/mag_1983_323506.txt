The Met 's music director spends only part of his life conducting in an orchestra pit . Excerpts from Levine 's hectic calendar : <P> Wednesday , 10:15 a.m . At his desk in his small first-floor office , an ever present towel tossed over his left shoulder , Levine scans the mail and then meets with General Manager Anthony Bliss to discuss a choreographer for next season 's opening production of Berlioz 's Les Troyens ; already three have declined . Assistant Manager Joan Ingpen , who is in charge of artistic administration , pops in to have Levine approve a " cover " for a sick tenor and to vet Director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle 's request to adjust his rehearsal schedule next season . " Once we counted 40,000 castings arranged over a five-year period , " says Levine . " It is a jigsaw puzzle beyond belief . " He signs letters and heads into the auditorium for an 11 a.m. rehearsal of Wagner 's Tannhuser . <P> 12:10 p.m . There is a half-hour break , but Levine never stops moving . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't be silly , " soothes Levine . Like an expert politician working a crowd , he is able to carry on a conversation without losing any time . He chats with Lighting Designer Gil Wechsler about a recent recital he played and compares notes on pianos . Then a quick lunch of half a turkey sandwich and a diet soft drink . More paperwork awaits : an invitation from Sarah Lawrence College to give a lecture series , replies to fan letters , rehearsal changes . <P> 12:40 p.m . Back in the pit , Levine continues with Tannhuser , periodically dashing into the house to check the lighting levels on the television monitor . The performance will be broadcast , and Levine knows that what he watches from the pit is not necessarily what audiences at home will see . By 1:25 p.m. he is once again back at his desk , eating the rest of his lunch ( a salad ) and looking over a list of apprentice singers to be approved and the provisional plan for the Met 's 1986-87 season . He sets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parade . <P> 3:03 p.m . The rehearsal over , Levine meets with Director Franco Zeffirelli to talk about three new productions . Ninety minutes later , he is at home for a preperformance rest . By 6:30 p.m. he is back at the Met . Says City Opera 's Beverly Sills : " I think I would slit my throat if I had to put on a long gown at the end of the day and go up onstage and sing . Switching gears is very hard , but Jimmy 's handling it very well . "
