The rumble underfoot starts faintly , then grows in force to recall the roar of a distant subway train . Tons of water are pouring down the 47-ft. drop at the Brockway Mills hydroelectric plant and smashing against the turbine blades . The glistening steel shaft connecting turbine to generator begins to revolve , accelerating quickly . Needles on gauges tremble and move upward ; panel lights go on . <P> Brockway Mills is on line , ready to feed 850 kilowatts of electric power from the Williams River falls into the Vermont power grid . For David F. Buckley , who swam at this same scenic spot as a boy and who has been struggling since 1979 to bring the modest $1.9 million plant into being , it is a rhapsodic moment . Standing inside the powerhouse as the 18-ft. - high generator whirs , he says , " For me this is like music . " <P> All of the equipment before him  --  control panels studded with dials and gauges , lights , signs shouting HIGH VOLTAGE !  --  is necessary just to light a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , run a few score washing machines . Because , for all its complexity , this installation produces only enough electricity to run some 400 households  --  a total of 2.5 million kilowatt-hours a year . <P> Buckley , 52 , is a soft-spoken lawyer of philosophic bent who likes to walk the woods of Vermont hunting for chanterelles . He started the hydro project because of a boyhood fascination with moving water and dams , which abound where he grew up ( and lives ) , the riverside village of Bellows Falls , and out of a growing concern in the 1970s over energy sources . " I saw those gas lines , and it seemed the Ayatullah could make it much worse on us if he wanted to , " he says . <P> He also believed the project would benefit society in another way . Every kilowatt generated from the river 's waters means less burning of fossil fuels , and less atmospheric pollution , less increase in the greenhouse effect . Operating Brockway Mills will save 4,000 bbl. of oil each year . And Buckley readily admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a concept known as doing well while doing good . <P> What he encountered , however , was a daunting list of bureaucratic obstacles and then a dismaying series of technical setbacks in building the plant . " It has been unbelievable , " he says . " I would n't think of doing it again unless the whole regulatory procedure was changed . " <P> First , to obtain the required series of federal and state permits and authorizations , various studies and projections had to be prepared by engineers and consultants . Buckley applied for the key federal document , issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , in November 1981 , then waited 14 months to get the license papers . It was also necessary to get a Water Quality Certificate from the Vermont department of environmental conservation . All told , permits or approvals were required from almost two dozen federal , state and local boards and agencies , and it cost some $200,000 to get them . <P> " The worst part was the agencies , " Buckley says . " The historic preservation division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection , Fish and Wildlife , National Parks , the National Marine Fisheries Service , the public service department of Vermont , the state agency of transportation , and on and on .
