Fidel Castro celebrated his 61st birthday last week , but the public greetings extended by a former comrade-in-arms could not have been welcome . In two programs beamed repeatedly to Cuba on U.S.-sponsored Radio Marti , Florentino Aspillaga Lombard , 40 , a soft-spoken and much decorated major in the Cuban intelligence service , told of his defection to the U.S. out of disgust and frustration with the Castro regime . He minced no words in accusing the Cuban leadership of corruption , decadence and abuse of power , and promised to blow the cover off Cuban intelligence operations . <P> According to U.S. officials , Aspillaga walked off his job as Cuba 's intelligence chief in Prague on June 6 , drove an embassy car across the border to Austria , and introduced himself to U.S. diplomats in Vienna . His crossover came just nine days after the defection of another high-ranking Cuban official , Air Force Brigadier General Rafael del Pino Diaz , who has also been heard on Radio Marti . <P> Apparently neither Aspillaga nor Del Pino knew the other planned to defect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within Cuba , as the economy continues to fizzle and Castro seeks to impose increasingly harsh austerity measures . Persistent but unconfirmed reports circulated last week that the U.S. had granted asylum to a third disgruntled Cuban official . Said a U.S. diplomat : " After 27 years , they have realized that Fidel has ruined Cuba . " <P> In Aspillaga 's radio broadcasts from Washington , where he is being debriefed by the CIA , he described Castro 's lavish life-style . The Cuban leader , he claims , has a private fleet of yachts and keeps a luxury home in each of Cuba 's 14 provinces . While the populace contends with housing shortages , Castro reserves " hundreds of houses " in Havana 's Jaimanitas section for the use of his security guards and aides . While the government demands austerity from the populace , Aspillaga said , officials order underlings to send home foreign luxury items and use government satellite dishes to tune in to U.S. televised movies . <P> The former revolutionary , who joined Castro 's movement at the age of 15 , claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several million dollars hidden away in Switzerland . " Who can sanction Castro ? " asked the defector . " What parliament or national assembly can ask for an explanation of what is done with that money ? " <P> The most damaging revelations concern the extent and nature of Cuba 's intelligence and military operations . According to Aspillaga , Cuba 's intelligence service , with a total of 2,086 employees , grew substantially more active after the U.S. invasion of Grenada . He said Cuba has steadily acquired U.S. technology , in violation of the American trade ban , through Panamanian Strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega , who reaped millions from the transactions . Noriega , he said , helped Cuba send arms to Nicaragua and to rebel groups in El Salvador , Honduras and Colombia . <P> Most important , Aspillaga said he will give U.S. officials the names of 350 Cuban agents who have penetrated foreign governments  --  after sufficient time has passed for these compaeros to return safely to Cuba . Intelligence analysts expect that the list will cripple Cuba 's covert intelligence-gathering capability for several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
