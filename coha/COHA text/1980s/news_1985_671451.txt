If celebrants wonder what Twain would have thought about all the fuss , he gave the answer in his notebooks : " What ought to be done to the man who invented the celebrating of anniversaries ? Mere killing would be too light. " // New York , of course , has a claim on Twain , and not just because a new musical , " Big River : The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , " opened Thursday on Broadway . Right after the Civil War , Twain moved to New York as a roving correspondent for The Daily Alta of San Francisco . In Manhattan , his roving eye lighted upon Olivia Langdon , who became his wife , and later they spent summers with her wealthy parents in Elmira , the upstate manufacturing city where Twain is buried. // " For every page that Mark Twain wrote in Hartford , he wrote 30 pages in Elmira , " says Holly Hewitt with marked enthusiasm . Miss Hewitt is director of tourism for the Elmira Chamber of Commerce , which has dozens of events planned between now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Nov. 30. // Literary historians at Elmira College maintain that " Tom Sawyer , " " Huckleberry Finn " and " Life on the Mississippi " were written during 20 summers spent with the Langdons . Twain had a study shaped like a Mississippi riverboat pilothouse outside the Langdon family manse , Quarry Farm , and there he would write all day . Defenders of Elmira as the home of some of Twain ' s major literary efforts maintain that when he was at home in Hartford he spent too much time being " Mark Twain , Famous Author. " // Quarry Farm is now the Center for Mark Twain Studies , and a replica of the pilothouse has been moved to the Elmira College campus . Beginning next month , there will be parades with Mark Twain floats , exhibits in the county museum , and - Sept. 7-8 - a Festival of Cats in honor of the greatest ailurophile in American literary history . " Mark Twain owned 19 cats at one time , " Miss Hewitt says . " Once , when he didn ' t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sounds plausible . In Chapter I of " Pudd ' nhead Wilson , " Twain wrote : " A home without a cat - and a well-fed , well-petted , and properly revered cat - may be a perfect home , perhaps , but how can it prove title ? " // The Twain family moved to Hartford in 1871 and resided there for 21 years ; the author ' s Victorian house at 351 Farmington Avenue is open to the public ( $3. 25 for adults , $1. 25 for children under 16 ) as the Mark Twain Memorial . Among other Hartford events , the writer David Bradley , who teaches at Temple University , will talk about " Huckleberry Finn " on May 10 at a church across the street from the Memorial . Also scheduled are a fair and a marathon reading of the book. // After living abroad and in New York , Twain moved in 1908 to a mansion near Redding , Conn. , where he died two years later ( the house burned down in 1923 ) . Redding will commemorate him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 7 there will be a concert , a play by the Mashed Potato Players and - a bow to Tom Sawyer - a fence will be whitewashed on the town green . The Mark Twain Library in Redding includes some of his books and photographs , a walking cane and a lap desk . <> <> ' New Discoveries ' // While laymen celebrate , scholars continue to debate the text and meaning of " Huckleberry Finn. " // " Every existing edition of Mark Twain ' s work - including ' Huckleberry Finn ' - is subject to new discoveries , " said Robert H. Hirst , the top Twain scholar , in an interview . He edits the Mark Twain Project at the Bancroft Library of the University of California at Berkeley . " You can never tell when a new letter will turn up that gives a clue to the author ' s intentions . " The latest edition of the book , published this month by the University of California Press , includes many changes. // " This edited text has several thousand details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twain ' s wishes , than the first edition of the book , " Mr. Hirst said . Errors crept into the original edition ; when Twain finished the job of proofreading begun by William Dean Howells , he said , " I cursed my way through the rest and survived. " // One particular passage - the " raftsmen ' s " scene - has been restored in the new California edition . Twain ' s publisher , Charles L. Webster , had suggested that he leave out this passage in order to publish " Tom Sawyer " and " Huckleberry Finn " as companion volumes and make the two books closer in length . Mr. Hirst said , " Twain went along - but for publishing , not literary , reasons - and therefore we put the passage back in its rightful place. " // Actually , Twain recycled the " raftsmen ' s " scene and included it in " Life on the Mississippi . " That is where it appears in the Library of America ' s edition of Twain ' s " Mississippi Writings , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Professors // Out of the English Department at the College of Charleston , in South Carolina , Thomas A. Tenney edits the Mark Twain Journal - a labor of love with a circulation of about 500 . In a survey conducted by the publication , nine black college professors were asked to comment because of the accusations of racism that have dogged the book since it first appeared. // " Since I ' m white myself , I decided to ask Professor Thadious Davis of the University of North Carolina to serve as guest editor , " Mr. Tenney said in an interview . " Personally , I ' m on Huck ' s side , but I can still see why black parents are very sensitive on the subject. " // All but one of the professors said Twain and his characters deserved to be studied without censorship in today ' s classrooms . The negative position was taken by Julius Lester of the University of Massachusetts . He found the book " simplistic " and " a dismal portrait of the white male psyche. " // Twain himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ignored by readers and scholars for 100 years , he said : " Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted ; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished ; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot . BY ORDER OF THE AUTHOR. " //
