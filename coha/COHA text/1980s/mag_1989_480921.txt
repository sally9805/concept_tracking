The first thing we did was build a bridge over Slough Creek , a pristine trout stream in the northern reaches of Yellowstone National Park . I felt strange digging and hammering in a wilderness area , spanning water that 's been protected since 1872 , fighting wildfire . The job is unglamorous and often brutal . The fundamental activity of a western fire crew is building " hand-line . " A handline is a narrow trail ripped out of the forest floor with hand tools . The common tactic for stopping a big fire is to create a handline ahead of the flames and then start a " backburn , " sending a fire to meet the oncoming blaze and thus establishing a charred buffer zone . The saying goes : " Make it black and you do n't come back . " At Slough Creek late last summer , we were facing a fire named Hellroaring , after a stream in the Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness of southern Montana , where the " man-caused " blaze , as it was called , had started two weeks before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating into . Yellowstone from the north . As we nailed the decking of our crude bridge , we could see dark clouds of smoke billowing over a ridge a couple miles away . It was windy and the fire was making a " run , " gobbling up forest at the rate of ten chains per hour ( one chain equals sixty-six feet ) along a one-mile front . Just before sunset it began to rain ? not water but thousands of black pine needles . They settled over camp like an evil harbinger . Massive convection currents were surging out of Hellroaring , sucking charred debris up into the sky and scattering it for miles ; that night we had to shake out our sleeping bags . The northern horizon was suffused with a deep red glow , as if we were perched near the rim of a seething caldera . Now and again the color intensified , and we could hear the roar of our enemy . I was happy to have the creek between us and the fire , but that night I had a bizarre dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were five crews in camp , and soon after dawn we all tramped across the bridge toward the fire . A full crew has twenty members , so our " strike team " was theoretically 100 fire fighters strong , but most crews had sustained casualties . Before being transferred to Yellowstone , our crew was nine days on another fire , and we 'd sent back two ? one fire fighter had a blown-out hack , the other a puffed ankle . Given the terrain and the action , I was surprised half of us were n't gone . Pain is a constant on the fire line , and over the course of our twenty-three-day tour , I suffered a hyperextended knee , a twisted back , two minor burns , a bruised thigh , one day of smoke headaches , a day and a half of diarrhea , a blistered thumb , and twenty-three days of sinus blockage . I felt better than most , though , especially the wretches with raw , blistered feet . Still , as we crossed Slough Creek , our crew was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Alan &; Sandy Carey shape . Most were veteran free-lancers , hired under the auspices of Superior National Forest in Minnesota and dispatched from Duluth . No mountain men , but we 'd been hardened , and we 'd had the rare opportunity the week before to help build and hold the line that stopped a big western fire ? the Hunter , a 5,000-acre blaze that burned across the Snake River from the Grand Tetons . Facing exploding fir trees a hundred feet high , we 'd scrambled around in a blizzard of sparks and embers , snuffing them out in our gloves before they could ignite fresh blazes behind us . I had n't been that scared for years . Beyond Slough we hiked uphill for a mile and a half , following a pack trail . At one point I was startled to see a huge buffalo staring at us a scant twenty yards away . ( I was gratified to note he was n't on fire . ) Near the crest of a wooded ridge , with a meadow at our hacks , we started building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to rapidly expose a band of mineral soil , each fire fighter doing only a small portion of the job . We were armed with Pulaskis , shovels , and McLeods , wielding them in concert . ( A Pulaski is a combination mattock and ax used for chopping , scraping , and digging ; a McLeod is a heavy-duty rake with a honed edge . ) A Pulaski takes a couple of swings ? breaking ground , hacking roots ? and then moves on , making room for the next tool . Shovels scrape and dig , and McLeods concentrate toward the rear for dragging and raking . Picture a hardworking chain gang . There 's the thud and clang of steel against duff and rock , with tools flashing through clouds of dust , punctuated by occasional curses and the shouts of squad leaders ? " Bump up ! Bump up ! " ? hastening tools along . It 's common for individuals to be doing too much , trying to make the line themselves . It 's difficult , but you must condition yourself to leave work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave , but pace yourself . Our average shift was thirteen , fourteen hours , and it 's wise to have a reserve of energy in case you 've got to mount a hasty , prolonged retreat . We each wore web gear to which was attached a daypack ( with lunch , headlamp , extra clothes , first-aid kit ) , three or four one-quart canteens , and a " fire shelter . " If you 're about to be overrun by fire and you ca n't reach a safety zone ( a burned-over area or an open meadow , for example ) , then you employ the shelter . Basically , it 's a heavy-gauge aluminum-foil pup tent that you rip out of its plastic case ? trying to stay calm ? snap like a rug to unfold , then crawl inside and hang on tight . A ripsnorting fire generates an awesome draft that can tear a shelter out of your grasp . It 's also prudent to clear away the combustibles on the ground beneath you ? if there 's time . Fire shelters have saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further proof . For nine hours we slashed through the wilderness , the rumble of Hell-roaring growing ominously louder as we advanced . It was bull work , a muscle-wearing , mind-taxing endurance run . It helps to slip into an altered state , a locale in your brain where the mechanical labor can be shunted into auto and your conscious thoughts slip off to more congenial territory ? like how you 're going to spend your fat federal paycheck . ( I was making $7.40 an hour , but my total hours were astronomical . ) We had line scouts out ahead and lookouts posted at critical points , and late in the day they all agreed our work was futile . We had one and a half miles of line in , but the strike-team leader decided we 'd be overrun before we could finish . The fire was moving too fast , and another blaze , the Storm Creek fire off to the east , was expected to close in . The day 's mission was for naught . Most of us laughed a tad bitterly to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires . The proposed line had been a gamble , an aggressive attempt to save more forest . But the fire ? now less than a mile away and a steady roar in our ears had outmaneuvered us . We withdrew to Slough Creek . Instead of a fire line , Yellowstone had another hiking trail . Noming brought a fresh strateout " ladder fuels . " These are any combustibles ? brush , lower limbs , saplings ? that would allow ground fire to climb into trees and " torch out , " perhaps initiating a " crown " fire that could broadcast sparks and embers for long distances . For half a day we used Pulaskis and a chain saw to clean up a zone forty feet back from the creek . Everything we cut was scattered widely in open areas so there 'd he no concentrations of fuel near the line . The strike-team leader reminded us that if we did n't hold Heliroaring at the creek , the next ( and last ) line of defense would be the highway . By noon we were ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico crew that had just arrived , we began packing 19,000 feet ? over three miles ? of one-and-a-half-inch and one-inch fire hose through the woods . We deployed it along the camp side of the creek for the entire length of the line , installing a wye , an attack line , and a nozzle every 200 feet . If any spot fires ignited on our side of the perimeter , we 'd nail them with water . The creek was low , but there was plenty of volume for our three portable pumps . By western standards we were water-rich , and a " water show " is the kind of fire fighting that folks from Minnesota understand best . My job was to scout 4,000 feet of the lay , hiking cross-country through tangled forest . 1 had to make a snap decision about every 100 feet ? should the hose go under or around a deadfalP follow the crest or the base of a slope ? ? keeping the amount of hose to a minimum , while covering the maximum amount of territory . I marked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the hose haulers . The New Mexicans worked like demons , shouldering 8,000 feet of hose in less than two hours . Like us , they 'd been out for weeks and were acclimated to the grind . Unfortunately , one of my quick decisions was wrong : I had them lay the last 800 feet of trunk line too far from the creek . My profuse apologies were genially accepted , mainly because I succeeded in shifting the blame onto " overhead " ? that is , the managers at the fire scene . Liability , after all , is YELLOWSTONE LETTER 71 done soon six hours . We had confidence in our hose lay , but we were not to discover how it worked out . Next morning , in the company of two other crews , we were bused to Gardiner , Montana , about twenty miles northwest . Our new assignment was on another part of Hell-roaring , this time deep inside the Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness . Our goal was the preservation of a grizzly habitat ; our new home was to be the Beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remote outpost . ) We 'd be lifted there by the next available Chinook helicopter , but in the meantime , we were sent to a youth camp at Mammoth Hot Springs , where we were allowed to take showers and sleep on beds under a roof . The roof was okay , but several of us opted to spread our bags on the floor . Once you 're used to sleeping on the ground , a bed is too soft . We rested well , interrupted only by the sleep-talking of a squad leader . A half-dozen times during the night he shouted out in a dream , issuing brusque commands for the laying of hose . We lazed around for most of the " heavy fuels " ? deadfalls , overmature stands , thick brush ? had accumulated . During the summer of ' 88 , when a fire got cooking it was likely to ' ' crown out " and race off on long , destructive runs . Wildfire ? via lightning strikes ? is a natural part of the ecosystem ; periodic fires not only cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest diseases and for some species , such as lodgepole pine , provide the best natural means of regeneration . So sixteen years ago the Park Service decided that some natural fires should be allowed to burn , as long as they do n't endanger human life or property . There was wide support for the " let burn " policy , but now the critics were saying that there had not been enough flexibility . It had been widely predicted that 1988 was going to be a dry year , so why did n't the Park Service jump on the fires immediately , leaving " let burn " for a safer season ? A good question . Still , some researchers believe that the 1988 fires are the apex of a two- to three-century cycle , an epic rejuvenation of the forest , not a disaster . Our strike-team leader , a wildlife biologist in the real world , said he expected there would be a lot of fresh elk pasture next spring . His chief concern was that erosion of burnt slopes would cause a silting problem in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating . An hour before sunset we were driven to a field north of Gardiner , and one crew at a time climbed aboard the twin-rotored Chinook . It was a military aircraft manned by army personnel , and it amazed me that such an ugly , ungainly beast could fly . We lumbered over wooded mountains , engulfed in the chopper 's roar . Sundown lent the smoky haze a purplish cast , and the high-country ridges undulated off to the horizon . There were no roads . We landed in a meadow bordered by blackened hills . It was a mile hike to the camp , and wranglers leading a thirteen-mule pack train arrived to pick up most of our gear . here was already a seven-mile , sixteen-pump hose lay at Beaver Creek and vicinity , and the next day we worked at improving the position , chopping ladder fuels and hauling cut logs across the line , Our principal mission was to start a backhurn off that line , and the next day the wind was favorable . With our crew and two others as backup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service 's highly trained , elite units , hurried along the line with " drip torches , " setting the forest afire . A drip torch is a heavy metal container that holds about a gallon of a fuel oil ? gasoline mix . There 's a nozzle and a wick , and when lit , you can tip the torch at various angles to release either drops or a small stream of flaming liquid . With a drip torch , you can create a line of fire as quickly as you can walk . Overhead , a helicopter made several low sorties , dropping small incendiary devices known as " ping-pang balls " farther from the line between us and Hellroaring , which was now about a half-mile away . To fill in any gaps , the hotshots fired charges from a flare gun . In a few minutes we were watching a crown fire howl through pine trees only 200 yards away . I saw a terrified mule deer leap out of the smoke and bolt for safety . Our job was to follow the hotshots as they passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backbum at bay . You want the fire to burn like hell without crossing the line . If a tree within twenty-five feet of the line began to torch out , we 'd hit the base with a brief hose burst to cool it but not extinguish it . Everyone was tense . The hotshots and the chopper were lighting 9,000 acres more or less at once , and if the wind switched we could be in deep trouble . Our water source was a shallow creek . Prior to the burn , several safety zones ? swampy meadows near the line had been scouted and marked with ribbon , and that 's where we were supposed to flee if the fire jumped the line and got out of control . For two hours after igniting the backburn , we bumped up the line from nozzle to nozzle , knocking down big fires and dispatching periodic patrols behind us to make sure nothing had drifted over . It 's called " hotline " work , and by the end of the 72 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE ! JULY 1989 shift we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the wind died , smoke settled over us in a poisonous pall , and the burn was a mad desert of flaming deadfalls and collapsing trees . But except for a minor " slopover " the line held , and two hours after dark we trudged back into camp for a late supper and early bed . At dawn we began " mopping up , " using hand tools and water to extinguish all hot spots within fifty feet of the line . The day after , we tried to mop in 100 feet , but the grizzlies had other plans . In the morning we saw huge paw and claw prints in the dust , and the strike-team leader said it was a " fairly small " grizzly . What ? They were the biggest bear tracks I 'd ever seen . When we got to the first pump station we found the plastic holding tank ripped to shreds , and a Jug of Gatorade that had been left floating in the tank was torn open and empty . It was the same at the next two stations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tank after another , guzzling Gatorade . Four hours later , when a pair of bears treed two pump operators , we were already withdrawing . Our crew was scheduled to move on anyway , but Beaver Creek was soon closed and the fire line abandoned . The grizzly habitat had been preserved , and with snow in the forecast , bears on the prowl , and too much Gatorade stocked in camp , it seemed pointless to linger . There were no Chinooks available , so we shuttled out in a smaller Jet Ranger helicopter , four or five of us at a time . It was a spectacular ride . To the south were roiling clouds from the North Fork and Wolf Lake fires . Dense , gray-black columns churned beneath a fire-generated thunderhead with a sunlit crest reaching up 30,000 feet and arching overhead . Deep within a veil of smoke we could make out the black silhouettes of mountains fringed with dark orange walls of flames . ( By last October , when the fires ended , a third of Yellowstone 's 2.2 million acres had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firestorm ; we were viewing the latter . It 's a good thing for a fire fighter to see-from far away .
