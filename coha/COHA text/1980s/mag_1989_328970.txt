A stretch of prairie north of Fort Worth seems an unlikely home for the " industrial hub of tomorrow . " Yet this is where Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot is constructing a 9,600-ft. runway that will carry mostly industrial products rather than human passengers . Perot and his son H. Ross Jr. , 30 , who heads the project , envision the Alliance Airport as the center of a 4,200-acre industrial park in which companies will manufacture products and distribute them by air freight . <P> Fort Worth has invested more than $75 million in the city-owned airport , and the Federal Aviation Administration has donated $31 million toward construction because it will help reduce congestion at other fields . The Perots , who donated 414 acres for the airport , plus $14 million , own nearly 17,000 acres nearby .
