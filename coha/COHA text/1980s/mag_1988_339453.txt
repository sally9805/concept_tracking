Dan Quayle made a promise to the American people before the vice-presidential debate : " You 're going to see the real Dan Quayle . " Until Wednesday night , many Americans thought the real Dan Quayle was a sunny , overconfident , high- spirited young man who had spent more time on the golf links than in the library . But the Dan Quayle at the debate was a different person : a grim , wooden , frightened fellow who had stayed up late memorizing answers for the big test . So nervous were Bush 's handlers that they denied Quayle any chance to be spontaneous , transforming him instead into an automaton searching for prepackaged answers that he could drone out safely . <P> The central issue of the Omaha debate was whether the 41-year-old Senator from Indiana had the intellect , temperament and judgment necessary to move into the presidency . Three times Quayle was thrown off balance when asked what he would do if he had to take over from George Bush . Quayle could only sputter bland inanities before falling back on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he compared the length of his experience with that of John Kennedy in 1960 . It proved a fatal flirtation with one of America 's most enduring myths . With precision and rhetorical balance , Bentsen uttered four terse sentences . " Senator , I served with Jack Kennedy . I knew Jack Kennedy . Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine . Senator , you 're no Jack Kennedy . " <P> " That remark was uncalled for , Senator , " Quayle interjected . Replied Bentsen : " You 're the one that was making the comparison , Senator . . . Frankly , I think you 're so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well taken . " It was as though a respected uncle had reprimanded his young charge for cheekiness . <P> Afterward , few seemed to care or remember that Bentsen had been evasive in answering questions about his policy differences with Dukakis . Or that many of his responses too were recited verbatim from his stump speech . But never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many he seemed more presidential than either George Bush or Michael Dukakis . <P> Bentsen also pressed the hot populist buttons that ignite Democratic voters . He played on nationalist sentiments by criticizing the trade practices of foreign countries and by ominously warning of their taking over American businesses . He raised the specter that Republicans are out to slash Social Security  --  never acknowledging that he , like Bush and Quayle , had voted for a freeze in cost of living increases . And dusting off a line he had used at the convention , Bentsen articulated the Democratic case against the apparent success of the U.S. economy : " You know , if you let me write $200 billion worth of hot checks every year , I could give you the illusion of prosperity too . "
