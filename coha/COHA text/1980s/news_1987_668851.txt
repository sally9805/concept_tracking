A distraught Liza King stood on the Hamlin Avenue overpass Friday afternoon , gazing through tears at her brand new college graduation gift on the Kennedy Expressway below . Water lapped at the windows of the shiny blue Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera GT and was soaking the leather upholstery inside . The car ' s emergency lights were still flashing . " I pulled over when I ran into the water because I knew better than to try to go through , " said King , 25 , who was on her way to work Friday morning when the rains got too heavy . " But it was already up to the side of the door . " Some motorists abandoned their vehicles on the Kennedy and Edens Expressways while several hundred others , blocked by huge lakes and with no way to get off , waited for hours in hopes the waters would recede . Viaducts and streets were flooded in city neighborhoods and suburbs north and west of the Loop where the downpour was the worst , plaguing drivers during both the morning and evening rush hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off until evening to anything on wheels . Public transit also took a hard hit . Service on the Chicago Transit Authority ' s Skokie Swift and on the rapid transit line to O ' Hare was shut down , commuter rail service delayed in some cases and service on many suburban bus routes was canceled or slowed severely . " We ' re very busy , " said Cheryl English , speaking for the Illinois Department of Transportation . " There ' s water everywhere . " More than 100 cars , trucks and buses were stranded on the Edens between lakes that formed behind and in front them at Montrose and Elston Avenues . A war-zone camaraderie developed , and at one point , a delegation walked to nearby houses to call both the state transportation department and Sen. Paul Simon ( D. , Ill . ) . They wanted crews to jackhammer down a four-foot high concrete barrier in the median so they could get to an exit on the other side of the expressway . It didn ' t work . " Some people have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not going to fight them , " joked an Edens trucker whose idled rig carried a load of meat . " I say feed the people . " But good will was not universal . Operators of a service station just off the expressway at Elston refused to let the marooned motorists use its rest rooms or telephone . The state transportation department by Friday evening listed more than 30 intersections and stretches of road throughout the Chicago area that remained closed because of flooding . Suburban officials tallied many more . In Elmhurst alone , York Road was closed from Madison Street to Butterfield Road , Madison was down from York to Ill . Hwy. 83 , Butterfield was out from York to Rt. 83 and 83 was closed at St. Charles Road and North Avenue . Lake Shore Drive was flooded at several locations and ramps but was open for its full length by early evening . On city streets , " most of the problems are still north of Belmont and west of Cicero , " said Kirsten Svare , speaking for the Department of Streets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays of up to an hour on the Metra Electric ( formerly Illinois Central Gulf ) and Chicago , South Shore &; South Bend commuter line Friday morning , and delays also were reported on west and northwest lines of the Chicago &; North Western . But by the evening rush , Metra operations were reported close to normal . Flooding on the CTA ' s line to O ' Hare caused service to cease on various segments , including the one from the River Road station into the airport . But by about 5 : 30 p. m. , trains were able to make their way to the end of the line again , relieving the all-day landlock at the besieged airport . " Congratulations , you have reached O ' Hare , " a conductor announced to passengers over the intercom as the first train pulled into the terminal station at 6 p. m . " Don ' t blame it on the CTA . Blame it on Mother Nature . " The renewed service was a relief to F.A. Macrouch , 76 , who had left a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the River Road station at noon . " I ' ve just been sitting here talking to myself , " he said . " I ' ve found I ' m very good company . " But he missed his 4 : 10 p. m. flight to Winnipeg . " We just spent the day at the Cumberland Station , " said Klaus Remme , 25 , who had missed a flight to Europe . " It was pretty exciting , " he said . He wasn ' t smiling .
