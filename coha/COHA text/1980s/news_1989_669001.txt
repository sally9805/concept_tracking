A.J. Foyt , by his own admission , went to sleep on the first lap of his qualifying attempt Sunday for the May 28 Indy 500 . Then the grizzled , tempestuous Texan shook himself awake to qualify for his 32d Indy start with a four-lap average speed of 217. 136 miles per hour . " I screwed up the first lap , " drawled Foyt , who hasn ' t won at Indy since 1977 . " I was asleep , if you want to know the truth . " I ' m getting up in age , " Foyt told the grandstand crowd over the public address system from his cockpit . " I guess they figure the old man ain ' t got it . But I intend to give them a hell of a run in the race . " Foyt , 54 , is part-preacher , part-philosopher , and a right smart stand-up comedian . He demonstrated it all in the press room after his qualifying run . " This place will make anybody nervous , " said Foyt , who won four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The clouds almost fall out of the sky when you ' re a rookie trying to qualify . " If somebody had told me when I started in 1958 that a guy could run the Indianapolis 500 at 220 miles an hour and never lift his foot off the throttle , I would have called an ambulance and had the guy committed . " Foyt , who sat behind the wheel of his first race car at the age of 3 , has driven 10 , 755 miles in race competition at Indy alone . Just behind him on the Speedway mileage chart is Al Unser , whose 1988 victory tied him with Foyt at four Indy wins apiece . " I didn ' t mind it at all when Al tied me last year , " Foyt said . " It couldn ' t have happened to a better guy . I ' d much rather be tied by a friend than by some S.O.B. I hate . " Foyt was asked if he foresees a new breed of drivers coming up to replace himself and the older corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of good young drivers , " Foyt said . " They won ' t have as much fun as we had , driving in all the short track races like we all did . And they ' d better learn to take care of their bodies . " We didn ' t do a lot of hanging around in bars and stuff . That ' s the reason some of us have lasted so long . We have lived a different lifestyle . " I think that ' s what ' s hurting our young athletes . It ' s all available to them ( drugs and alcohol ) . " I believe in giving a man one chance to rehabilitate himself . If there is a second offense , the man should be barred from competition for life . And I mean that . " Foyt estimated he has logged about 250 miles , " probably 50 hot laps , " in his Lola Cosworth since Indy practice started a week ago , an indication that he ' s serious about this year ' s race . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Foyt admitted . " I think we ' ve got a good shot . Last year we didn ' t . " If a guy can run an honest 211 or 212 the whole race , you ' re gon na have to catch up with him . I knew we could run a pretty solid 217 ( in qualifying ) . I wouldn ' t have taken any less . " Foyt , who always has an extra car or two ready as back-ups , declined to say whether he will allow someone else to attempt to qualify one of them as he usually does . " I ' m down here to win this race , " Foyt said . " I ' m not going to do nothing with any of the other cars . If one of my cars is gon na win this race , I ' m gon na be in it . " Foyt paid the resurfaced Speedway the supreme compliment . " This is probably the smoothest race track in the whole world , " he said . " Some tracks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This track is as soft as a mattress. "
