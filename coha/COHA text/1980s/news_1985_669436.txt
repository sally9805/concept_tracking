While the number of choices has grown significantly , with products like CATS , TIGRS , zero-coupon bonds , money market deposit accounts , and mutual funds begun just for the IRA market , almost all of these investment options can be found at four basic types of firms. // This list , along with the table at the bottom of this page , presents some of the pros and cons of these IRA choices. // // Banks : In 1982 , this was the most popular location for IRAs . Banks and savings and loan associations garnered over 70 percent of the early IRA deposits . That share has slipped , but banks and S &; Ls remain one of the most popular IRA investments . For people who want absolute safety and a guaranteed interest rate , certificates of deposit offer this , plus federal deposit insurance up to $100 , 000 . Also , fees for opening an IRA are very low . Some banks , in fact are not only charging no fees , they are offering small cash bonuses or gifts for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrifts charge a heavy penalty for early withdrawal , even though the Internal Revenue Service won ' t penalize you if you take the money out and put it into another IRA within 60 days . So , if you buy CDs for your IRA when interest rates are low , you could end up on the short end of things if rates go up very much . You can get more flexibility by putting your money in one of the newer money market deposit accounts , but the yield will be lower. // Mutual funds : These have been one of the fastest-growing vehicles for IRAs . They offer considerable flexibility , ranging from highly conservative money market funds investing in US Treasury bills , to aggressive stock funds . If conditions in the economy or securities markets change , investors in fund ' ' families ' ' with several funds can move from one fund to another with a phone call . In a no-load fund this can be done at no charge. // There have been , however , numerous complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another , or to a bank or broker . To get around this , you can take advantage of the once-a-year rollover provision , allowing you to receive a check from the fund directly and reinvest it elsewhere yourself within 60 days. // With the exception of money market funds , mutual funds can also experince a loss in principal , as their net asset values , or share prices , can fluctuate . Last year , for example , the average equity fund underperformed the Standard &; Poor ' s 500 index , and some that did very well in 1983 did very poorly in 1984. // Brokers : If you like to make your own investment decisions , with perhaps some guidance from a broker , self-directed IRAs may be for you . Not only can you invest in stocks and bonds , you can have access to the options markets , limited partnerships , as well as mutual funds and government securities. // On the other hand , even discount brokers may charge more to take your money and make purchases and sales than you would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker will probably be the most expensive of all . ( If this broker has made a lot of money for you , though , the higher commission could be worth it . ) Also , while you and your broker may be fairly good at picking stocks , the overall performance of your IRA portfolio is subject to market conditions beyond your control. // Insurance companies : There are two basic annuity products offered to the IRA market . Both guarantee regular payments for a certain number of years or the life of the policyholder . Fixed annuities guarantee you a minimum specified rate of return , while variable annuity contracts can change , depending on how well the investments in the portfolio perform . These investments can either be chosen by the investor or selected by the company , depending on the firm and/or the policy. // Fixed annuities give you a guaranteed rate , but they might not hedge against inflation . Variable annuities , particularly those that let you select among a group of investments - usually mutual funds - offer more flexibility , but their performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the high upfront fees , or commissions , that insurance companies charge . It could take your policy several years to earn back the money lost to these fees . There are , however , insurance companies that charge very low up-front commissions , or no commission at all , if you leave the money with them for a minimum number of years . There may also be stiff penalties for early withdrawal . **22;34900; <> **44;34924; **44;34970; **44;35016; <> **76;35062; **28;35140; Alternative investment vehicles for IRAs <> <> **76;35170; **28;35248; <> **76;35278; **28;35356; Investment <> **28;35386; Benefits <> **28;35416; Limitations <> <> **76;35446; <> Certificates of <> <> **76;35524; <> * fixed rate of return <> **26;35602; * may not always hedge <> <> **76;35630; <> deposit <> **26;35708; **26;35736; against inflation <> <> **76;35764; <> **26;35842; **26;35870; * rate of return likely to be <> <> **76;35898; <> **26;35976; **26;36004; lower , since less risk is <> <> **76;36032; <> **26;36110; **26;36138; involved <> <> **76;36166; <> **26;36244; **26;36272; * penalties for early <> <> **76;36300; <> **26;36378; **26;36406; withdrawals <> <> **76;36434; <> <> **76;36512; <> Mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to <> <> **76;36646; <> **26;36724; * ability to switch among <> **26;36752; market fluctuations <> <> **76;36780; <> **26;36858; various funds <> <> **76;36886; <> **26;36964; * professionally managed <> <> **76;36992; <> **26;37070; portfolio of stocks bonds , <> <> **76;37098; <> **26;37176; money market instruments <> <> **76;37204; <> **26;37282; * potential to outperform <> <> **76;37310; <> <> **76;37388; <> Variable annuities <> **26;37466; * liquidity <> **26;37494; * performance subject to <> <> **76;37522; <> **26;37600; * ability to switch among <> **26;37628; market fluctuations <> <> **76;37656; <> **26;37734; various funds <> **26;37762; * penalties for early <> <> **76;37790; <> **26;37868; * professionally managed <> **26;37896; withdrawals <> <> **76;37924; <> **26;38002; portfolio of stocks bonds , <> <> **76;38030; <> **26;38108; money market instruments <> <> **76;38136; <> **26;38214; * potential to outperform <> <> **76;38242; <> **26;38320; fixed-rate-of-return <> <> **76;38348; <> **26;38426; investments <> <> **76;38454; <> <> **76;38532; <> Fixed annuities <> **26;38610; * fixed-rate-of-return <> **26;38638; * may not always hedge <> <> **76;38666; <> **26;38744; investments <> **26;38772; against inflation <> <> **76;38800; <> **26;38878; * guaranteed income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> **76;38934; <> **26;39012; based on performance of <> **26;39040; to be lower : <> <> **76;39068; <> **26;39146; investment <> **26;39174; less risk involved <> <> **76;39202; <> **26;39280; **26;39308; * penalties for early <> <> **76;39336; <> **26;39414; **26;39442; withdrawals <> <> **76;39470; <> <> **76;39548; <> Zero-coupon bonds <> **26;39626; * fixed rate of return <> **26;39654; * possible market penalties <> <> **76;39682; <> **26;39760; * guaranteed income for life <> **26;39788; if redeemed early <> <> **76;39816; <> **26;39894; fixed rate of return <> **26;39922; * does not hedge against <> <> **76;39950; <> **26;40028; * wide range of maturities <> **26;40056; inflation <> <> **76;40084; <> <> **76;40162; <> Common <> **26;40240; * flexibility in structuring <> **26;40268; * limited diversification <> <> **76;40296; <> stocks/bonds <> **26;40374; * portfolio <> **26;40402; * performance fluctuates <> <> **76;40430; <> **26;40508; liquidity <> **26;40536; according to investment <> <> **76;40564; <> **26;40642; * potential to outperform <> **26;40670; selection and market <> <> **76;40698; <> **26;40776; fixed-rate-of-return <> **26;40804; conditions <> <> **76;40832; <> **26;40910; investments <> <> **76;40938; <> <> **76;41016; <> Real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidity <> <> **76;41150; <> limited partnerships <> **26;41228; with inflation <> <> **76;41256; <> **26;41334; * relatively low risk <> <> **76;41362; <> **26;41440; * potential for income and <> <> **76;41468; <> **26;41546; captial appreciation <> <> **76;41574; <> <> **76;41652; <> Oil and gas income <> **26;41730; * potential inflation hedge <> **26;41758; * limited liquidity <> <> **76;41786; <> limited partnerships <> **26;41864; * potential for income <> <> **76;41892; <> **26;41970; * limited supply of oil ( may <> <> **76;41998; <> **26;42076; result in increased prices <> <> **76;42104; <> **26;42182; over long term ) <> <> <> <> **22;42210; <> **44;42234; **44;42280; **44;42326; <> **76;42372; <> <> <> <> <> // //
