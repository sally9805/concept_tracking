So the Norton Gallery of Art in West Palm Beach , Fla. , has done us all a service by organizing a show called " In Nature ' s Ways : American Landscape Painting of the Late 19th Century " that can be seen at the National Academy of Design through Aug. 16 . Bruce Weber , curator at the Norton Gallery , and the art historian William H. Gerdts were responsible for both the show and the catalogue . In all , some 75 paintings are on view . Many of them are very large , and in their original frames , so that the show has an unmistakable period look. // The big second-floor gallery at the National Academy makes a noble impression , thanks to the fact that William Lamb Picknell ' s " Road to Concarneau " of 1880 hangs directly across from strong paintings of seaboard subjects by Childe Hassam , William Merritt Chase and William Leroy Metcalf . Picknell is not a household name , but his painting of a Breton road ( laid down not long before , and still looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white and stony infinity is one of the best paintings to have been produced by an American in France at that time . Strong , ample , well considered and commanding in its attention to detail - note how the milestone in the lower left-hand corner of the canvas points the way back to infinity - it can hold its own with the work of many of Picknell ' s French contemporaries. // As for the Hassams , the Chases and the Metcalf , we can almost smell the salt in the air above Gloucester , Mass. , and on the Shinnecock Hills on Long Island as we look at them . In works like these , American landscape painting got its act together , and to memorable effect . Not all the show is on that level , and once or twice a terrible dullness comes upon us as this or that big painting turns out to have little but a certain historical relevance to justify its presence . But this is a show that has to be considered piece by piece , rather than in terms of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One great name makes itself felt by its very absence , in that the Winslow Homer in the catalogue was lent only for the Palm Beach showing . Other big names make , however , cameo appearances that are as impressive in their way as the time when Laurence Olivier played the quite small part of the Button Moulder in " Peer Gynt " and ran away with the show . This visitor will not forget the impact of the little study by Thomas Eakins for a painting called " Meadows , Gloucester " that dates from around 1882 . Eakins doesn ' t seem to be doing anything much - just an aromatic smudge here and there , and not too many of them - but we recognize it at once as the work of a great artist . Albert Pinkham Ryder is there , too , and in unwontedly matter-of-fact form in his " Weir ' s Orchard " of 1885-90 . Or is it possible that this visionary ' s orchard is set up for us as a stage on which some drama of disquiet will be played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then , on the third floor , there is a painting by Whistler . It shows an English beach , called Selsey Bill , toward the end of the day . The light is draining away from an almost uninflected stretch of sand that reaches way up into the top half of the canvas . The sky , likewise , is settling down for the night , with almost transparent washes of color that will presently disappear . All the world - or so it seems - is winding down . Except in the foreground , that is . Down towards the bottom edge of the canvas - Whistler paints it as if from high above - three human figures can be seen . A mother , or perhaps a nanny , and two children , rather overdressed ( by today ' s standards ) for the beach . The older woman stands straight and still . The children bend , jump , dance around . Whistler doesn ' t describe what they are doing , and he models them hardly at all . But with just a ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand , he gives us the whole scene . The eye alternates between those two figures , whirling back and forth in their vigorous disarrangement , and the stillness of sand and sky. // Still , there ' s only one Whistler , and we always knew how good he was . The lesson of this show is that this country was full of landscape painters who went their own way , whether in Europe or back at home , and turned out paintings that can not be classified under any particular school but have kept their freshness intact . They didn ' t necessarily ape their French contemporaries , either. // To have been the pupil of J. F. Millet or a follower of Bastien-Lepage was a big plus , at the time , but it may not seem so today . The heroes of this show , for this visitor , are painters like Robert Williams Vonnoh ( 1858-1933 ) , who could make a memorable , exact and plainspoken image out of some steep-pitched roofs and a couple of blind walls . As for Arthur Wesley Dow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if prizes were in order , for his painting of some distant marshes . Dow did not believe in taking his tune from other painters , and in fact he rated an evening with prints by the great Japanese master Hokusai as more valuable than long years of studying the work of the West. // What this meant in practice is very well shown in Dow ' s contribution to the National Academy show . With its repeated color shocks that look arbitrary but are really most cunningly conceived , its deft handling of a serpentine river and its easy aerial command of deep , plunging perspectives , Dow ' s " Marshes " is one of the most original American paintings of its date ( 1892 ) . Altogether , this is a show that sags here and there but finishes strongly. //
