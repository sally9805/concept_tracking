The President has designated Jamaica , under Prime Minister Edward P.G. Seaga , as the centerpiece of his Caribbean Basin Initiative and as the testing ground for what he describes as the " magic of the marketplace . " It is an important theme in both Mr. Reagan ' s foreign and domestic policy. // The assistance to the aluminum companies , pushed through in the name of helping Jamaica and pleasing the President , underscores the close relationship between the Administration ' s foreign policy and American business . It also illustrates the extent to which the Federal bureaucracy responds to Presidential directives , especially when the President has publicly and repeatedly voiced enthusiasm for a project. // // Businessmen ' s Findings // At Mr. Reagan ' s request , David Rockefeller , then chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank , organized a group of businessmen to help revitalize Jamaica through private investment . But that group , the United States Business Committee on Jamaica , has already concluded that " pure private investment in the more traditional sense will not do the trick by itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Jamaica by generating American investment has yet to pay off there , but the Federal assistance to corporations has already stirred questions in Congress. // In one case under investigation by a Congressional committee , the General Services Administration , at President Reagan ' s direction , organized the purchase of $67 million worth of Jamaican bauxite for the United States strategic stockpile . The Administration waived Federal laws calling for competitive bidding and use of Americanflag vessels. // " I follow the directives of the President , " said Roy Markon , G.S.A. commissioner for the Federal Property Resources Service , defending the noncompetitive acquisition . " He said buy Jamaican bauxite , and the best way to do that is a negotiated deal. " // The bauxite is be mined by the Reynolds Metals Company and the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation and shipped , processed and stored by Reynolds , enabling those companies to increase their business and lower their overhead at a time when worldwide demand for bauxite and aluminum is depressed. // To accomplish the deal , the Federal Emergency Management Agency was required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Government officials , bauxite was not considered a top priority. // In another case , the Overseas Private Investment Corporation , an independent Federal agency in the executive branch , has tentatively agreed to guarantee a $50 million loan and grant insurance against political risk such as war or expropriation to Kaiser , Reynolds and the Anaconda Aluminum Company to help those companies expand a jointly owned bauxite venture , known as Alpart . Top OPIC officials acknowledged in interviews that the assistance exceeded the agency ' s limit on insurance to one country , but they said the agency would alter its procedures because of political pressure and Presidential interest . <> <> ' We Can Bend the Rules ' // " The President says we want to help the Caribbean and Jamaica , so we can bend the rules , " said Robert L. Jordan , vice president of OPIC for public and Congressional affairs. // As part of his effort , Preident Reagan is to meet Wednesday with chief executive officers of American companies that have investments in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries. // President Reagan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum industry by Jamaican leaders and the Rockefeller group . More members of the group come from the aluminum industry than from any other industry. // In addition to the investigation by the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries , some Government and private foreign policy experts have questioned the effect on United States policy making of the Rockefeller group ' s joint involvement with the Administration , Jamaica and business interests. // Last fall Myer Rashish , then Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs , concerned about the " limited impact " of efforts to help Jamaica and the State Department ' s heavy reliance on Mr. Rockefeller as an intermediary with the Jamaican Government , called for a study , according to State Department officials and documents . Mr. Rashish resigned earlier this year , and the Jamaican study has not been completed . <> <> Relations With Jamaica // Mr. Rockefeller , now retired from the Chase Manhattan Bank , originally agreed to be interviewed about his committee ' s activities but canceled the appointment , citing personal reasons . Nancy S. Truitt , the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls. // Under President Reagan and Mr. Seaga , who was elected Jamaica ' s Prime Minister about the same time as Mr. Reagan won the United States election , Jamaican-American relations have been close . Mr. Seaga replaced a Socialist , Michael Manley , and gained favor with President Reagan because of his conservative philosophy , oriented toward private enterprise . Mr. Seaga was the first foreign leader to visit President Reagan in Washington . The Seaga visit last year led to the creation of Mr. Rockefeller ' s committee and hope for Jamaican revitalization through private investment. // The philosophic ties and hope remain . President Reagan visited Mr. Seaga in Jamaica earlier this month . He told reporters before he went that Jamaica was " where the whole Caribbean initiative began . " While he was there , he praised Mr. Rockefeller ' s committee . The Caribbean Basin Initiative , announced in February , is a package of private sector-oriented aid , trade and investment incentives that awaits Congressional approval . <> <> P.U. FIRST &; LAST ADD JAMAICA <> <> Documents and Interviews // More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality of Jamaican revitalization and American business investment and the efforts of the Rockefeller committee have yet to match the rhetoric , an examination based on documents and interviews with Jamaican and American officials discloses . Specifically , the examination finds little progress , as shown by these developments : // - In the 12 months ended March 31 , 1982 , according to Mr. Seaga , only 18 new American investments totaling $10 million had started in Jamaica , despite his goal of attracting $638 million in foreign investment in three years . Six other investments , totaling $32 million , have been approved but are not yet in operation. // - Jamaica ' s umemployment has remained basically flat over the last year , at about 250 , 000 people - a rate of 26 percent - and the new American investments have created only 1 , 000 jobs at most , according to Jamaican figures . Per capita income remained steady while the rate of inflation declined significantly. // - Most of the American business investments so far have not involved the 25 companies that are members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase Manhattan Bank , Eastern Airlines , the Atlantic Richfield Company and Bank of America . Furthermore , large investments planned by committee members require Government assistance . <> <> Access to High Officials // Whatever its success , the Rockefeller committee , although not a Government agency , has enjoyed unusual Government support and frequent access to President Reagan and other senior officials , according to Government documents . In Jamaica , the committee is provided office space and an administrative staff by the Jamaican Government , and Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. has assigned a State Department official to act as liaison with the committee , documents also show. // During one of the committee ' s meetings with President Reagan , a gathering last July 2 in the Cabinet Room , the President was asked to authorize the purchase of Jamaican bauxite , according to several persons who participated in the meeting . The arrangements and briefing papers within the White House for that meeting were handled exclusively by the office of Michael K. Deaver , White House deputy chief of staff , including Joseph W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the participants . Administration officials say it is quite unusual for the National Security Council not to brief a meeting that pertains to foreign policy. // Mr. Deaver declined to respond to questions about the meeting . Mr. Canzeri , who resigned earlier this year following disclosure of a low-interest loan he had received from Laurance S. Rockefeller , said that David Rockefeller " may have called me up and requested the meeting . " Mr. Canzeri added that it was " probably very possible " that he had scheduled the meeting for the President . <> <> Military Needs Cited // Last November , while on vacation at his California ranch , President Reagan cited military needs in officially directing the purchase of 1. 6 million tons of Jamaican bauxite. // The United States maintains a stockpile of more than 100 crucial or strategic materials for defense needs or for use during national emergencies . The purchase of Jamaican bauxite is the only acquisition specifically directed by Presidential order in more than 20 years , according to G.S.A. officials. // Some Administration officials say bauxite , the ore from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1981 stockpiling goal for Jamaican bauxite was based on political risk calculations that were made during the administration of Mr. Manley , Mr. Seaga ' s predecessor , and that are no longer valid . Paul K. Krueger , the assistant associate director for resource preparedness at the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which coordinates stockpile priorities , said in an interview that he would rank bauxite " seventh or eighth " on a list of 13 needed materials. // Under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act of 1979 , competitive bidding in stockpile acquisitions can be waived only by the President , who must explain his reasons to Congress . <> <> G.S.A. Letter to Congress // A few days after President Reagan announced the stockpile purchase , the General Services Administration , the chief procurement agency for the purchase , sent a letter to Congress saying the acquisition would not be competitive because the President had directed a government-to-government negotiation for " foreign policy " reasons. // Roger Campbell , a spokesman for Reynolds Metals , said his company ' s participation was " an accommodation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " close to cost. " // Late last year Representative Walter B. Jones , Democrat of North Carolina , chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee , asked the G.S.A. why American-flag vessels were precluded from bidding on the bauxite purchase , since the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 requires Federal agencies to use such vessels when available . The Reynolds ships are registered in Panama. // Reynolds and the General Services Administration said other carriers did not qualify because their ships would not " properly interface " with the " unloading facilities at the Reynolds installation at Gregory , " according to G.S.A. documents. // The House committee plans to hold hearings next month on the bauxite acquisition to see whether it was necessary , why competitive practices were not followed and why American ships were precluded , according to Edmund Welch , committee counsel . <> <> Plant Expansion Sought // President Reagan ' s interest in bauxite includes the contemplated expansion of Alpart , the jointly owned plant in Jamaica. // Alpart applied last year to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation for insurance against political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s board of directors adopted a rule limiting the agency ' s insurance coverage in any one country to 10 percent of the agency ' s total exposure . A Senate committee report in 1973 criticized OPIC , asserting that it had bowed to political pressure and imprudently insured aluminum companies in Jamaica. // Although OPIC ' s coverage in Jamaica is already over the 10 percent limit , according to OPIC officials , the agency has agreed to a $50 million loan guarantee for Alpart . The agency , according to OPIC and company officials , has also tentatively agreed to extend insurance coverage for some of the expansion , which is expected to cost more than $100 million. // Craig A. Nalen , president and chief executive officer of OPIC , said in a telephone interview that OPIC ' s Jamaica exposure was 11 percent but that " we are going to bend a little when there ' s political pressure . " He added that OPIC also had to be " prudent . " Mr. Nalen went on to say that he had discussed the Jamaican bauxite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier this month. // He said Mr. Reagan was " heartened to know that the Alpart expansion " was going ahead and that OPIC was " making available partial insurance.
