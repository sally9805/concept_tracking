It is the tobacco harvest season in Lancaster County , and Mr. Beiler , his wife , Mary , and his five children were flanked by other Amish families cutting the waist-high plants and hauling them in to 100-year-old barns to be hung from the rafters and air-cured. // The crop , worth $2 , 000 an acre , is one of Mr. Beiler ' s principal sources of income , but by no means the only one . On his 80-acre farm , Mr. Beiler raises corn and alfalfa to feed 50 milk cows. // At a time when leading agricultural economists have declared the small commercial family farm a relic , Lancaster County ' s 1 , 200 Amish farm families are thriving . With diverse crops on small farms , with a conservative approach to farm technology and with constant manual exertion , even by little children , this region ' s Amish have largely escaped the high debt that has put 250 , 000 to 300 , 000 family farms out of business since 1981 . <> <> ' You Get Too Big ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been tough , and it ' s not going to be the last , " said a 40-year-old Amish man from New Holland who asked not to be identified . " Our leaders know this . If you get too big , you make a bundle in good times . But you lose a bundle when times turn bad. " // The Amish are providing a stable economic base to a county with one of the nation ' s most vibrant farm economies . Land prices are climbing . Farm implement and supply stores are busy . Banks are open and pursuing new farm customers . The value of the total farm output in the county is more than $700 million annually and rising steadily . Sloping fertile Lancaster County is crowded with white farmhouses and silos spring from the valleys like silver-topped mushrooms. // " There ' s no secret , " said Mr. Beiler . " We ' ve been blessed with fertile ground , and we work , maybe too hard. " // Despite this modesty , some agricultural authorities insist that Amish farm practices and economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American farming for more than 30 years may no longer be valid . <> <> The Systems Are Diverse // Amish farmers protect themselves from the cycles of boom and bust in agriculture by operating diverse production systems . Most have herds of milk cows and grow feed corn , alfalfa , hay , wheat , tobacco , vegetables and fruits . Some raise poultry and cattle . Others breed horses and raise mules. // The Amish also avoided Government farm supports . The programs require farmers to idle acreage as a requirement for receiving benefits . " We don ' t need handouts , " said Mr. Beiler . " We need to work every foot of land that we own. " // The Amish community of Lancaster County numbers 6 , 500 people and is growing quickly . Although the Amish own less than a quarter of Lancaster County ' s 5 , 000 farms , their system has been used as a model for the Mennonite and " English " farmers in the region. // Amish farmers generally till 70 to 80 acres , enough for one family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American farm . The average non-Amish farm in the county is not much bigger. // Mules and horses haul implements at a cost Amish farmers say is one-third that of a tractor . The Amish buy mechanical harvesting equipment that is pulled through fields by teams but whose machinery is powered by independent gasoline or diesel engines . <> <> They Work to Cut Erosion // The Amish developed advanced programs for rotating crops , applying manure and fertilizer and growing along ridge tops to lessen erosion . They buy the best seed // A result is that Amish farmers produce as much corn per acre as bigger farms in Iowa , or as much milk per cow as Wisconsin ' s dairy farms , but at far lower costs . Pennsylvania State University estimates the cost of planting an acre of corn at $115 . Mr. Beiler and other Amish farmers say they can put the crop in the ground and harvest it for under $35 an acre. // An important source of savings is in the cost of labor . From the time they are toddlers , Amish children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children are educated in one-room schoolhouses until the eighth grade , and then become full-time helpers . Eight children in a family is not unusual . <> <> ' They Have to Work for It ' // In a tomato field ringed by feed corn near Honey Brook , 30 miles east of Lancaster , one Amish farmer , Sam Stoltzfus , explained the source of his people ' s strength . He said that Amish families helped one another at planting and harvesting and that children were taught that they were central in the community . " We have to eat , " he said . " We have to feed the children . And they have to work for it , just like we did. " // The lessons are simple , but they have been proved workable over centuries . Only a handful of the Amish have been forced out of business since 1981 , according to the Amish and county bankers. // Farm finance experts say net profits on Amish farms are unusually high . An Amish farm of 80 acres , 40 cows , five acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual income of $125 , 000 or more . Because of their religion ' s demand for " plainness , " annual expenses for feeding , clothing and housing an average Amish family with six children total $6 , 000 to $8 , 000 . Amish farmers generally have moderate debts , principally in loans for land. // Most Amish share the costs of mechanized equipment , dividing the purchase of a baler or corn harvester among three or four farms . <> <> Among More Profitable // Their net income usually totals $25 , 000 to $40 , 000 . Coupled with off-farm income from the sale of quilts and other handcrafts , the Amish have operations that are among the nation ' s more profitable commercial family farms. // " The Amish farmer puts all the modern models to shame , " said Paul Whipple , a long-time farm consultant who has many Amish clients . " They don ' t have their money tied up in machines . They aren ' t looking to buy out their neighbors . They put their money into the best land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the Amish system would not work for most American farmers and their families . " People just don ' t want to work that hard anymore , " said Jay W. Irwin , the Lancaster County farm agent. // Yet the Amish successes , said Mr. Irwin and Mr. Whipple , suggested that smaller farms might be more suitable. // After dark , Mr. Beiler brings in his mules and his family retires to a large kitchen lit by a gas lantern . His youngest daughter sleeps in Mrs. Beiler ' s lap . The boys sit on a bench . Mr. Beiler , his 40-year-old eyes bright despite a full day in the field , sends his sons to bed and asks : " Tell me about the farmers in Iowa - what went wrong ? " //
