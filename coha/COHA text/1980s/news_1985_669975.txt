WASHINGTON  --  The House Agriculture Committee approved a three-year farm-credit program that offers more liberal lending than the Reagan administration has favored . The panel essentially adopted provisions previously backed by its Conservation , Credit and Rural Development Subcommittee , including authorization of $3. 85 billion a year in combined farm-operating and land-ownership loans for fiscal 1986 , which begins Oct. 1 , through fiscal 1988 . The bill also emphasizes a continuation of Farmers Home Administration direct loans to farmers , rather than moving toward government-guaranteed commercial loans . The White House has wanted to switch most Farmers Home lending to the guaranteed loans . But the administration ' s dislike for the three-year funding totals has been constrained by the agriculture-credit crunch of recent months , which has forced the agency to join commercial farm lenders to provide direct funding for many more borrowers than it expected . The committee ' s action followed the panel ' s earlier approval of the dairy and conservation planks in the major 1985 farm bill . The committee hasn ' t yet tackled key price-support programs for such crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is struggling with that issue , seeking a compromise between proposals to slash support levels , in an effort to stimulate farm exports and reduce farm subsidies , and those directed toward preserving farm income through price supports . The House panel approved $3. 15 billion in farm-operating loans for each of the next three fiscal years , including $2. 5 billion annually in direct Farmers Home loans . The administration , seeking to eliminate direct lending by the agency , has wanted such lending cut to $1 billion in fiscal 1988 from $2 billion in fiscal 1986 . But administration officials didn ' t express any objections to the committee totals approved yesterday . A panel staff member said that Farmers Home has provided $3. 4 billion in farm-operating loans so far in fiscal 1985 , and he said the agency will probably make more available before the fiscal year ends . The $3. 4 billion is considerably more than the $1. 9 billion originally allocated for such loans this fiscal year , he noted . " They have transferred so much money . . . into operating loans ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a piker , " he said . The credit program also revived a controversial idea that aims to increase financing for spring plantings . President Reagan vetoed a farm-credit bill with this provision in February , and Agriculture Secretary John Block has opposed the idea vociferously . The provision would empower the agriculture secretary to make advance payments to farmers on the crop loans they usually get after harvests , starting in fiscal 1986 . Those advance loans would have to be repaid , unlike the usual post-harvest crop loans . A farmer can default on the usual post-harvest loans , for the most part , and let the government take over the crops , if the farmer decides the market price is too low . The program would require farmers to obtain crop insurance covering any such advance-loan payments , to ensure that they can repay the loans even if the crop is destroyed . The committee also approved an amendment to the subcommittee bill that would prohibit Farmers Home from selling land , acquired in a foreclosure , if putting it on the market would depress farm-land values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
