Scientists have long believed that at the genetic level , men and women are pretty much the same . According to textbooks , only two of the 46 gene-carrying chromosomes in a human cell  --  a pair known as the sex chromosomes  --  are noticeably different in males and females . But at a genetics seminar last week at Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor , Me. , this conventional wisdom took a beating . Participants cited evidence that there may be many more differences in male and female genes than previously thought . That revelation challenges assumptions about heredity held for more than a century . <P> Human chromosomes come in 23 pairs . One member of each pair is from a person 's mother and the other from the father . Except for the two sex chromosomes , the members of each pair were thought to be interchangeable . It seemed that the way a chromosome functioned in the cell had nothing to do with whether it came from the mother or the father . <P> But new studies of genetic diseases suggest that the chromosomes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , children who through a reproductive malfunction receive two copies of chromosome No. 7 from their mother and no copy from their father sometimes suffer from a severely retarded growth rate . Naturally occurring cases of a kidney cancer called Wilms tumor are caused by a missing chromosome . But in almost all cases , the missing chromosome was the mother 's , not the father 's . <P> " This is just absolutely mind boggling , " said Judith Hall , a geneticist from the University of British Columbia . " It 's a new way of thinking . " And that new way may continue to reveal subtle differences in the genetic makeup of the two sexes .
