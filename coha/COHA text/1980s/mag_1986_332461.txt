Four years ago , when seven people in the Chicago area died after taking cyanide-laced capsules of Tylenol pain reliever , the crime seemed so horrible  --  so peculiarly horrible  --  that it was hard to believe it would ever be repeated . And yet it has been , again and again . Last February tainted Tylenol capsules killed a Peekskill , N.Y. , woman . A month later traces of rat poison were found in Contac cold capsules and Teldrin allergy medication in Houston and Orlando . Two weeks ago , medical investigators discovered that two residents of Auburn , Wash. , had died as a result of swallowing toxic Excedrin capsules . Bristol-Myers quickly pulled Excedrin capsules off the market nationwide , but last week Auburn 's cyanide scare spread to yet another brand of pain-killer . During a random check of a pharmacy in the Seattle suburb , Food and Drug Administration officials found poisoned capsules of Anacin-3 , made by American Home Products . Within a day , the State of Washington imposed a 90-day ban on the sale of most nonprescription capsule drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable business ( 1985 sales : $1.5 billion ) , but the market is suddenly shrinking . Within the past five months , both Bristol-Meyers and Johnson &; Johnson , the maker of Tylenol , have stopped selling any of their nonprescription drugs in capsule form . While most other manufacturers insist that they have no current intention of walking away from this market , consumers and producers across the U.S. are pondering the uncertain fate of the still popular product . <P> Thousands of different kinds of nonprescription capsules continue to be sold today . In all , Americans bought about 10.5 billion doses of these gelatin-cased medications last year . Among the leading brands : Contac ( made by SmithKline Beckman ) , and Sinutab and Benadryl ( both made by Warner-Lambert ) . Nearly all over-the-counter drugs are two-piece capsules , although the single- piece model , used for some vitamins , is perhaps safer . If anyone were to try ; to pierce a single-piece shell , it would probably leak and be very difficult to seal again . In tampering with two-piece capsules , a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medication and later put the pieces back together . So far , though , single-piece capsules can hold only liquid drugs . Reason : the medication can not pass through the special machinery used to make single-piece capsules unless it is in liquid form . Most over-the-counter medication comes in powder or solid-pellet form . <P> When the first deaths from capsule poisonings were reported , companies said they would be developing tamper-resistant products . In the beginning , manufacturers focused on making the outside of the packaging more secure . For example , they placed tightly sealed plastic around the tops of the bottles . Later came other ideas . R.P. Scherer , a capsule manufacturer , developed a " soniseal " machine that uses sonic waves to weld the two pieces of a capsule together . Eli Lilly last year made available to U.S. manufacturers a similar technique . A band of gelatin is placed around the waist of the capsule , where the two pieces overlap . That makes it tougher to open the casing without leaving a mark . But companies were slow to adopt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill bottles was sufficient protection .
