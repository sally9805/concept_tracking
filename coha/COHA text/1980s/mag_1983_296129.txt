People are still watching TV , a study says , but liking it less <P> In Las Vegas , a city where optimism is an occupational hazard , junketing television broadcasters were dealt a bad hand last week . The dealer , ironically , was the National Association of Broadcasters , a trade organization that usually touts the future of TV in royal flush terms . At a press conference during its annual convention , the N.A.B. released a study that resembled an elaborate good-news/bad-news joke . The good news : Americans are watching as much television as before . The bad news : they like it a whole lot less . " This study is a little daring for a trade association to reveal to its members , " said a candid but not contrite N.A.B. President Eddie Fritts . " But we did it to be sure that our members are equipped to deal with what 's coming . " <P> The study , conducted in conjunction with McHugh &; Hoffman , a TV consulting firm , will not be released officially for a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report is based on a poll of 1,500 viewers and follows up a similar study made six years ago .

As far as technical innovations are concerned , most people surveyed wanted high-definition TV signals , which will simply enable them to see more clearly the shows they do not like watching anyway . The brave new world of convenience offered by electronic newspapers , home banking and shopping via TV does not thrill them : it seems that people want to balance their checkbooks with pencils and finger the dresses to see if they really are all wool . This , says the study , is an example of the so-called high-tech/high-touch phenomenon , which means that as technology gets more sophisticated , people seek a counterbalance in human contact . <P> Thus far , network executives seem only to want to execute the messenger of ; these bad tidings , rather than heed the message .

Do you think if the cigarette industry found that smoking causes cancer , they 'd call a press conference to advertise the fact ?
