A promising career is derailed by a heroin bust <P> From the police 's standpoint , it was a routine undercover procedure , a smalltime heroin sting . The " dealer " in the Washington motel room last Monday night was a District of Columbia policeman . The buyers were two unwise young men : the acquaintance who set them up with the dealer was a police informer . In short order , five parcels , half a gram of heroin in each " nickel bag , " were exchanged for $150 . The dupes headed outside , into a circle of four waiting police officers . Winston Prude , 32 , a lawyer , panicked and stuffed one of the nickel bags into his mouth ; it was pried out by police . His companion , dressed in a suit , did nothing and said nothing . Both were charged with possession of heroin , a misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $10,000 fine , and promptly released on bail . According to Captain James Nestor , commander of Washington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , suggesting that last week 's drug buy was not their first . <P> As it turned out , the rather unremarkable bust had Brideshead Revisited overtones : the silent co-defendant was Eric Breindel , 27 , an aide with the Senate 's Select Committee on Intelligence for New York Democrat Daniel P. Moynihan . Says an older friend : " He is a golden youth , this kid . He is loyal , honorable , fine , delicate , conscientious and loving . " <P> Even before Moynihan hired him last November , Breindel 's resume was impeccably top drawer : Exeter prep school education , editorial chairman of the daily Crimson as an undergraduate at Harvard , graduate of Harvard Law School , sometime student at the London School of Economics . He has a book in progress about Zionist history and has written an impressive sheaf of neoconservative pieces on politics and foreign affairs for the Wall Street Journal , the New York Times , the New Republic and Commentary .

" He is charming and attractive to boot ; a few years ago , he was the escort of Caroline Kennedy . Adds the incredulous editor : " He was no square , but he believes in the values of straightness . " <P> Yet some who know Breindel suggest that he has been ambivalent about these values and regularly swerved into the fast lane . At Harvard he roomed with Robert Kennedy 's son David , who has had his much publicized drug problems . Other friends , groping for an explanation , speculate that Breindel 's chronic physical pain-he had undergone several operations in recent years for wrist and kidney ailments-led him to seek an illicit painkiller . Yet it is hard to understand why he would not stick to prescription relief : both his father and sister are physicians .
