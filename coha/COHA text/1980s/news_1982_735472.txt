txt The interest groups that have grown up around this country 's civil rights bureaucracy are at it again , accusing the Reagan administration of negligence in enforcing the laws of the land . Chairmen of state civil rights agencies have charged that civil rights enforcement has deteriorated . The Washington Council of Lawyers says the administration has abandoned " bipartisan civil rights policies . " When a U.S. official said the administration might help local governments ask the courts to dismantle failed busing programs , newspapers treated it as a big-news scandal . The federal civil rights mess is going to be one hard knot to unravel . The busing flap is the most recent incident . A story in the St. Louis PostDispatch said the Justice Department was thinking about aiding the city in an attempt to modify its court-ordered busing system . Other papers picked up the scent , and soon the department issued a general statement saying that it would indeed consider helping out in such cases . William Bradford Reynolds , assistant attorney general for civil rights , said this was nothing other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enterprising reporter looked back through the documents and concluded that a " subtle shift " had in fact occurred . " We will consider it an all-out assault , " the general counsel of the NAACP reacted . The Justice Department 's actions " signal an intent to join the law violators . " The department 's position was an " outrage , " said Americans for Democratic Action President Robert Drinan . It constituted " deliberate and flagrant flouting of the law . " This theme of law-abiding officials vs. lawbreakers appears again and again in the debate over federal policy toward minority groups . The head of the American Civil Liberties Union recently wrote a piece in The New Republic berating this administration 's policies toward minorities . " There is no room for debate about what the law requires , " he wrote of the busing debate , " and whether it should be enforced . The obligation of government  --  particularly the Department of Justice  --  is clear . " It is not surprising that this should be the language of civil rights activists . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which to achieve better treatment for blacks in this country . They had no economic leverage , certainly , or conventional political power . White Americans had up ' til then displayed no notable liking for their black fellow citizens , and not much sensitivity to religious teachings on the subject of brotherhood . All the activists had was the peculiarly rigorous notion in our American constitutional system of equality under the law . An appeal to the law was what gained the civil rights movement its first concrete gains . More important , the idea of equal rights under the law was what led white Americans to support the movement . There can be few places in the world where the idea of equal rights has such a compelling effect on citizens . The civil rights movement benefited from this fact and learned a lesson . In the battles to come , the movement would appeal again and again to the courts , and keep trying to make rules that would leave as little room as possible for wrongdoing . But the issue of minorities is n't a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any simple or readily understood sense . It has involved affirmative action , quotas , compensatory programs , CETA grants , and policy questions like whether busing is worth having when it establishes rigorous rules to put black children into white schools only to have those schools resegregated when white parents flee the city . In areas like the current busing debate , with the issues so complex and the law so manifestly muddy , it is immensely offensive to have the activists contend that there is one clear version of the law , that they own it , and that anyone disagreeing with them is a lawbreaker . Furthermore , it is n't going to do any good . Asking for the right to vote is one thing ; demanding a 63.2% white classroom is not quite so compelling . And finally , carrying on this way is a tremendous waste of energy that should be devoted to more productive ways of improving minorities ' condition . Let 's stop the name-calling and scandal-mongering and start having some sensible policy discussions .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
