" The longer the market turmoil goes on , the more consumers will sit on the sidelines , " said Ronald L. Promboin , senior economist with the Amoco Corporation in Chicago . " The more the consumer retrenches , the more you ' re going to start seeing business plans affected. " // Mr. Promboin , like many economists , has pared his forecast of growth in the nation ' s gross national product because of the market ' s plunge . He now foresees annual growth of about 1. 7 percent , down from 2. 7 percent. // Most economists asserted that a recession is not likely , despite the psychological damage caused by the 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 19 . But at least one respected economist , John Rutledge , chairman of the Claremont Economics Institute in Claremont , Calif. , said he is convinced a recession began that day. // A recession is usually defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in the nation ' s output of goods and services . Since World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most economists agree that about $1 trillion in buying power , which had been presumed to be available to owners of common stocks , has been erased from the stock market since the Dow Jones industrial average reached a peak of 2 , 722. 42 on Aug. 25. // " The market ' s plunge need not have any significant or lasting effect on the nation ' s standard of living , " Martha R. Seger , a Federal Reserve Governor , said today in New York . But she added that consumer confidence had been " thoroughly shaken " by the decline in stock prices. // " I wonder whether the consumer will be as willing as before to make major spending commitments , " Reuters quoted Ms. Seger as saying at an investment conference. // The consumer confidence index of the Conference Board , a business research group , is scheduled to be releases today . It will show only a slight decline after the stock market drop , said Fabian Linden , the board ' s director of research into consumer economics . " Before the market plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past weekend it dropped to 110. 4 , which is a difference of 6. 5 and insignificant , " he said. // In comparison , after the December 1973 oil crisis , the board ' s confidence index plummeted by one-third , Mr. Linden said. // Lawrence Chimerine , chairman of the WEFA Group , formerly Wharton Econometrics , in Bala-Cynwyd , Pa. , said consumer spending would be a key factor in whether economic growth ends in the coming months . After the market collapse , Mr. Chimerine pared his 1988 forecast of G.N.P. growth by one percentage point , to 1. 5 percent. // " When you consider the high debt levels of American consumers , you can ' t rule out a steep recession , " he added . " We ' re dealing with trying to measure fear . The speed of the market ' s decline is scaring people . " <> <> Historic Pattern : Downturns // In the past , a collapse in stock prices has generally led either to a marked slowdown in economic growth or a recession , according to Geoffrey H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research at the Columbia University Business School. // The reasons are several , he said . When stock prices fall , it costs businesses more to raise capital to finance their growth ; stockholders ' wealth is slashed , and consumers and businesses are more reluctant to take on debt . The result is a prevailing caution that restrains demand for goods and services. // " There is a 50-50 chance that real growth in 1988 could be close to zero , " said Norman Robertson , chief economist of the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh , who had anticipated a growth rate of 2 percent next year . " I see little or no increase in consumer spending in 1988 , but continued improvement in capital spending as well as in foreign trade. // " If actions by the United States , Germany and Japan are prompt and decisive , it ' s entirely possible that the fallout from this entire affair will be minimal . If there is delay and hesitation , the uncertainty will mount and there is a good chance we can have a recession. " // Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States before the market collapse . Strong spending by consumers had led the economy on an unusually long upward path . That advance , which will mark its fifth anniversary next month , represents what Mr. Moore called the longest peacetime expansion of the American economy since 1796 . An expansion from February 1961 to December 1969 - which was extended by factors related to the Vietnam War - was the longest since World War II. // Economists said one explanation for the sustained spending by consumers in the current expansion was the parallel rise in stock prices , which began in August 1982 . This , they said , gave consumers a sense that they were better off , a condition economists call the " wealth effect . " Meanwhile , personal savings fell to what is now the lowest level since the 1930 ' s. // For many executives , the tumult on Wall Street was jarring , but spending projects are apparently going ahead as planned. // Ennius E. Bergsma , who heads a corporate finance consulting practice with McKinsey &; Company in New York , said most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated they planned to stay with 1988 budget plans already in the works . " They don ' t think the collapse portrays the beginnings of a recession , " he said , adding that he agreed with that assessment. // Jerry J. Jasinowski , chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers , in Washington , said the Commerce Department ' s report of a 3. 8 percent increase in the annual G.N.P. growth rate during the third quarter confirmed his view that the economy remained in good shape. // Still , he said , he pared his 1988 G.N.P. growth forecast by a percentage point , to about 2 percent , because of the stock market ' s plunge . His new forecast assumes that the dollar will be stable , the Dow Jones average will settle near 2 , 000 and interest rates will hold steady or fall slightly. // David A. Wyss , chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. , in Lexington , Mass. , said a recession could be avoided next year if central banks in West Germany and Japan lower interest rates and stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growth rate of 1. 5 percent next year , down three-quarters of a point because of the stock market. // Mr. Wyss said the earliest , best measure of whether consumer confidence was shaken by the market selloff will be the next report on 10-day auto sales , due Nov. 4 . Mid-October sales , reported last Friday , were at an annual rate of 6 million cars , unchanged from a year ago. // Mr. Rutledge , of Claremont Economics , said last week ' s plunge in stock prices immediately touched off a recession that could last for perhaps three quarters , the duration of a normal recession. // But the downturn could be extended if Congress enacts protectionist laws in an effort to trim the nation ' s trade deficit , he said . " Protectionism is the one event which could turn this recession story into story of a worldwide recession , collapse and depression , " he said. // Michael K.
