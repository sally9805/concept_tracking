Shortly before Bill Clements took office as Governor of Texas in January , he named a Dallas clergyman as his staff adviser on matters of morality . The appointment was unusual but not all that surprising : Clements has talked a lot about morality . <P> A wealthy Republican businessman who served as Governor from 1979 to 1983 , Clements regained the office last November from Democrat Mark White , partly by accusing him of duplicity . As chairman of the board of governors of Southern Methodist University , a post he gave up when he took office in Austin , Clements assailed the S.M.U. system for permitting wealthy boosters to pay football players to perform for the Dallas school . Such practices brought the school seven citations from the National Collegiate Athletic Association for violating its rules . <P> " The whole system " of shady recruiting " is wrong , " Clements declared in October 1985 , two months after S.M.U. was placed on probation by the N.C.A.A. for the sixth time . When yet another scandal was unfolding at the school in November , Clements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mouse business going on in our athletic department . " Two weeks ago , when S.M.U. was completely banned from football this year and limited to just seven road games next year , Clements was asked whether , while serving on the university 's board , he had ever approved payoffs to athletes . His reply : " Hell , no . Absolutely not . " <P> His response should have been " Well , yes . " At the end of a routine press conference last week , Clements admitted that he and other unnamed S.M.U. governors had actually decided to let payments to some players continue despite the N.C.A.A. punishments . His self-contradictory explanation : " We  --  with a capital we  --  we made a considered-judgment decision over several months that the commitments had been made and in the interest of the institution , the boys , their families and to comply with the N.C.A.A. , that the program would be phased out and that we would comply in a full sense of integrity to all the rules and regulations . " <P> Even in a football-crazy state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a following as any politician , Clements ' confession proved startling . After a meeting of 17 S.M.U. governors , the new chairman reported that none had admitted knowing of any agreement merely to " phase out " the cash instead of cutting it off . The board voted that any member who had such knowledge must resign . <P> Students paraded into a meeting of the faculty senate chanting , " No more lying , no more cheating . " The faculty called for a probe of the board of governors by the university 's 71-member board of trustees , which has ultimate control over campus affairs . The accreditation board of the United Methodist Church , which owns S.M.U. , began a study of whether to sever the church 's ties with the school , which date back to its founding in 1911 . <P> Finally , a former member of the S.M.U. board stepped forward to confirm that in 1985 Clements had said " it would take some unwinding " before the cheating could be stopped . Apparently a small group of the governors had agreed informally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players already getting cash should continue to do so but that no future players should be paid .
