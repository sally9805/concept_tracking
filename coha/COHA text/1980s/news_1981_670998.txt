His suspicions could not be more dark . " They ' ve got some kind of plan , that ' s what bothers me , " he rumbles . " What the hell are they up to ? " // Five years after the first scouts of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon ' s Unification Church appeared in Gloucester , the reason for the church ' s growing presence here is still regarded as a mystery by most , and as a threat by Mayor Alper and many townspeople. // The intensity of feeling , which grew hard and ugly last summer when the church unexpectedly acquired the Cardinal Cushing Villa from the local Roman Catholic archdiocese , has softened , but time has brought no understanding to close the gap . <> <> Restaurant Picketed // Here , as everywhere , Mr. Moon ' s followers are called " Moonies " by those outside their church . The T-shirts bearing the legend " Save the Human Race/ Punch a Moon in the Face " seem to have been put away for now . But every weekend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New One Restaurant , which is owned by a Moon corporation and is next door to the similarly owned International Seafood Company. // Last night , as the pickets marched to warn potential customers of the ownership , passing cars honked and jeers and epithets floated through the chill air toward the few people standing at the takeout window and the office of the World Tuna Tournament. // The tournament , organized for the first time last year by the Moon organization for publicity , is probably the richest tuna fishing contest in the world . At the end of a week ' s fishing , the boats that have caught the heaviest , the longest and the highest aggregate of tuna draw for first , second and third place , which are worth $70 , 000 , $20 , 000 and $10 , 000 , respectively. // There was some splitting of the prize money last year , but by the best calculation , when the arithmetic was done , Moon organization fishermen walked away with $97 , 000 of the total . <> <> No Local Boats // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Commissioner Gus Foote , meaning no local , non-Moon fishing boats . " None . And I ' m very doubtful whether there ' s any this year. " // Judy Skarsten , a church member who is employed to speak for the tournament , said that almost 100 boats had entered the present competition but that she did not record whether they were crewed by people from the Moon organization . But she knew that some local fishermen had entered , she said , even though they had been threatened. // The contest ended tonight , and the proof of whether local sentiment has again remained closed and steadfast against the prospect of such riches will come tomorrow morning , when the drawing is done. // But Gloucester , a clapboard , steepled town of about 28 , 000 on the harbor 40 miles north of Harvard Yard , has grown close and stayed close through centuries of braving the Atlantic in quest of such ground fish as haddock and cod and , to a far smaller extent , tuna . <> <> Always a Fishing Town // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has always been a fishing town , " said Mayor Alper . " I would say that fishing is still the main industry here. " // Above his office , on the third floor of the old city hall , by a pair of deep windows that look out toward sea , is a list of names that give some indication of the depth of common experience here , an experience to which the Reverend Moon ' s people come as strangers. // The names are those of the 6 , 000 Gloucester fishermen who lost their lives at sea between 1874 and 1978 . Gus Foote , the city commissioner , was himself a fisherman for 25 years . " I ' ve been fishing with most of those men , " he said today , looking at the names listed from 1946 on . " And I knew all of them. " // The local fishermen are united against the Moon group , Mr. Foote said , because they fear the Reverend Moon ' s followers are trying to gain control of the fishing industry by buying harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load ice to cool their catches , by buying one of the only two big fish wholesale houses here. // " Church ! " he said distastefully . " I don ' t even call it a church . They do . It ' s more like organized crime , organized as a way of getting money . " <> <> Members Appear Pleasant // Still , the young men and women who work at the Moon enterprises and staff the church ' s in-house seminars and its mission here remain outwardly pleasant and optimistic about the townspeople , many of whom regard all of them as deluded captives of their church. // " They say brainwashed , " Larry Witham said with a smile as he sat on the porch of the New One Restaurant last night listening to the abuse shouted from the passing cars. // Still , he said : " My feeling is that there is a pretty strong undercurrent of friends here in the community who don ' t feel that they can come out and say so . Perhaps if it was known that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church next Sunday , people might be talking about you. " // Mr. Witham is the assistant director of a new Moon project called the Ocean Church , a separate legal entity that buys space and meals from the Moon restaurant and marina space from the Moon marina and uses the Moon fleet of 30 sport fishing boats to teach " discipline , skill , concentration and the value of group dynamics , " he said . <> <> Building a Congregation // The program ' s purpose is twofold , he said . " Part of it is to do public relations for the church , and part of it is to build a fellowship there . A congregation. " // Behind the apparent sweet temper and sincerity of Moon followers like Mr. Witham and Miss Skarsten , who says of the Reverend Moon , " I think he ' s the Messiah , " lie the great wealth and unknown intent of the Unification Church itself . That is what worries people here. // Kathy Hurlburt , a housewife and antiques shopkeeper here , recalled one church official who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , " she said with a laugh , " he loves it so much he ' s going to buy the whole thing. " // Whatever the church ' s plans for Gloucester , they will obviuosly have to be carried out over the opposition of Mayor Alper , who is coincidentally up for re-election in November . <> <> Tax Exemption Requested // " Now they ' ve come in and asked for a tax exemption for the Cardinal Cushing Villa , " he said . The villa , a former mansion on 11 acres overlooking Freshwater Cove , was used most recently as a rest home for nuns by the Roman Catholic Church . Now it seems to be used as a dormitory and meeting place by Moon followers. // " I ' m going to fight it , " the Mayor declared . " That ' s a piece of property that in my opinion is worth close to $2 million. " //
