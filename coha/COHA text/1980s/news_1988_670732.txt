The cities , emptied by the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot , are humming again , probably too full with squatters for the intermittent but improving supplies of electricity and water . Farmers and merchants are given more leeway . The markets , if poor , are bustling after a decent harvest. // Smuggled goods and drink from Thailand and Singapore are readily available , often at prices cheaper on the black market than at their origin . The currency , which the Khmer Rouge abolished , is far more stable than the Vietnamese dong , with a black-market value only 7 percent below the official one. // // Unease as Vietnamese Leave // But there is considerable unease at the heart of this Government , as the protection offered by Hanoi slowly marches away in progressive troop withdrawals . The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge , who have been fighting as a guerrilla force since they were removed from power , retain strength in large parts of the countryside , sustained by supplies from the refugee camps along the Thai border. // It is unclear , an official said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year from now. " // Vietnam , isolated by most countries since the invasion and beset by economic problems made worse by that isolation , has said it intends to withdraw all of its troops from Cambodia , estimated by the United States to number 120 , 000 at the year ' s outset . <> <> Hanoi Says 50 , 000 Withdrawn // Hanoi said that by Christmas it had withdrawn 50 , 000 of the troops , but Western diplomats think the total is only 35 , 000 . Most diplomats , however , believe that Vietnam will be out of Cambodia by the end of 1990. // Any likely diplomatic settlement to the Cambodia problem envisages at least a partial dismantling of the Government and an interim administration incorporating its opponents , including the Khmer Rouge , under whose rule , beginning in April 1975 , more than a million Cambodians are believed to have died. // The Vietnamese established a party and a Government of Khmer Rouge defectors from eastern Cambodia , who went to Vietnam to escape internal purges in 1977 and 1978 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shunned as illegitimate by most governments , except India and the Soviet bloc . It has faced steady opposition from the followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and a former Prime Minister , Son Sann , as well as from the Khmer Rouge. // Mr. Hun Sen , now 37 years old , over a decade has blossomed from a shy and poorly educated soldier , leaving the Khmer Rouge just ahead of the purges , to a self-assured and well-spoken leader of substance . He speaks confidently of holding his own against the Khmer Rouge and winning any elections that might follow a settlement. // But even Soviet bloc diplomats , who along with their advisers and international aid workers make up most of the foreigners here , acknowledge that while Mr. Hun Sen has come along nicely , " the circle of efficiency around him is very small , " as one of the diplomats put it . <> <> Countryside Is Not Secure // The diplomats also acknowledge that security in parts of the countryside is an intermittent pleasure , and that few people travel roads , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never at night. // The Government is said by Western diplomats in Bangkok to have about 44 , 000 soldiers in roughly six divisions , as well as provincial and village militias , which are now being built up to what Mr. Hun Sen hopes will be a total of 200 , 000 fighters. // He has said the village militias would rely on a combination of " older weapons and traditional ones . " Asked if that meant knives and arrows , an Eastern bloc diplomat shrugged . " At least they ' re protecting their own land , " he said. // One aid worker with long experience here , who speaks Khmer and works with farmers in the countryside , said the Government controls what the French used to call " Cambodge utile , " or " useful Cambodia " - the cities and most of the rice-growing land . <> <> ' Capable of Defending Ourselves ' // But more than half of Cambodia is forested , he said , " and no one has ever controlled the Khmer Rouge in the forest , where they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ; the province of Kompong Speu , west of Phnom Penh , was " hot " for eight years , then went " cold " and " now is hot again , " he said. // Pres Samoeur , the deputy chairman of the committee for the province of Kompong Cham , north and east of the capital , said that no more than 100 Vietnamese soldiers remained in the province , and that " we are capable of defending ourselves. " // There were 600 , 000 people left alive in Kompong Cham when the Vietnamese ousted Pol Pot . The population now is 1. 29 million , and the provincial capital has been reinhabited , with a population of 36 , 000. // Mr. Pres Samoeur stressed the Government ' s gains against the Khmer Rouge , but his figures were more revealing than the official platitudes in Phnom Penh . In the last 10 years , he said , the Khmer Rouge have killed about 8 , 000 Cambodians in the province , including 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 Government officials and party cadres . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines , he said . <> <> Growing Activity of Khmer Rouge // From 1979 to 1984 , he said , " the killing was very much less " than now . " But in the last two years , the activity of the Khmer Rouge in killing the people is increasing a lot , " he said . " Before people who resisted were given re-education only . Now when they are arrested they are killed. " // He said defections from the Khmer Rouge were increasing , but then said that " today , more than 1 , 000 Khmer Rouge guerrillas remain in Kompong Cham. " // Given the distance from the Khmer Rouge camps along the Thai border and the province ' s proximity to Vietnam , Mr. Pres Samoeur ' s figure was surprising , leading some analysts to suggest that the Khmer Rouge inside the country , before any diplomatic settlement or formal repatriation of refugees , might exceed 20 , 000. // " We are trying our best , " Mr. Pres Samoeur said , " to be masters of our country and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sen express a similar nationalism , showing little affection for the Vietnamese , and many express pleasure that nearly all Vietnamese advisers are gone , much of their work taken over by Soviet advisers and international aid agencies . <> <> A ' Highly Dependent ' Patriot // " Is Hun Sen a puppet or a patriot ? " an Eastern bloc diplomat asked impishly . " I ' d say he ' s a patriot , but a highly dependent one. " // Mr. Hun Sen has a sort of negative legitimacy , the diplomat agreed , symbolized by the standardized tour of mass graves any visitor receives . His Government has not committed mass murder ; it has not forced mass evacuations from the land or the cities ; it has not abolished connections with modernity , but instead seeks them. // More positively , it has been flexible in economic matters , dumping Communist dogma and allowing more private business and personal mobility. // But with freer enterprise , the economic gap between the countryside and the city has grown once again - the sort of disparity that fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> Many People Wary // " The Government will have to be very careful about this , " a diplomat said . " A peasant or even a cyclo driver sees more cars and stereos and says , ' For what have we made the revolution ? ' " // There remains considerable shock after the Pol Pot experience , an aid worker said , and many people still waiting to see what will happen . Until several years ago , he said , " the question mark in people ' s minds was huge . It ' s still there , but now it ' s smaller . " Still , very few Cambodians //
