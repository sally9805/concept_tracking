Three plays in three tenses : past , present and future <P> Having made visible inroads on Broadway , British exports are now annexing off-Broadway and the U.S. regional theater . In the past three weeks , Top Girls and Skirmishes opened off-Broadway and Quartermaine 's Terms at New Haven 's Long Wharf Theater . Interestingly enough , counting Nell Dunn 's Steaming , already running at Broadway 's Brooks Atkinson Theater , three out of four new British entries are by women , possibly because Britain 's feminist consciousness is just now peaking . Top Girls displays some postfeminist tristesse ; only Steaming seems earnest in its feminist polemics , ironically garnished with pre-fig leaf nudity . <P> The opening scene of Top Girls , by Caryl Churchill ( author of the long-running off-Broadway hit Cloud Nine ) , is the strangest of dinner parties ; the hostess is alive , but all the guests are dead . Marlene ( Gwen Taylor ) is a smart , hard-nosed career woman who is celebrating her promotion to managing director of the Top Girls Employment Agency at a London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few prima donnas , or " top girls , " of past centuries to celebrate with her . <P> There is Pope Joan ( Selina Cadell ) , who is said to have ascended the throne of St. Peter around A.D. 855 and who was later stoned to death . Also joining the party are Isabella Bird ( Deborah Findlay ) , an intrepid 19th century Scottish traveler ; Lady Nijo ( Lindsay Duncan ) , a 13th century Japanese courtesan who became a Buddhist nun ; Dull Gret ( Carole Hayman ) , who led an avenging legion of women into the precincts of hell in Brueghel 's painting Dulle Griet ; and finally , Patient Griselda ( Lesley Manville ) , made famous in Boccaccio and Chaucer as the model of a loyal , submissive wife . <P> The women chat furiously and funnily about their experiences . Yet the underlying tone is oddly melancholy . Men have debased and abused them , and torn their children from them . <P> The rest of the play , in which the women of history double in contemporary roles , shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleeing her home and family at 17 , she left her illegitimate child Angie ( Hayman ) with her sister Joyce ( Findlay ) to be raised as Joyce 's own . Angie is a touching clod of a girl , dimwitted , lazy and fearful . <P> The girl 's plight triggers a screechy , preachy political cat fight between Marlene and Joyce . Marlene is a staunch advocate of Margaret Thatcher , whom her sister derides as " Hitlerina . " The question raised is provocative : Is the future to be divided between a smart , scrambling upper class of no-holds-barred individualists and a permanent underclass of poor souls who are unfit for the survival of the fittest ? <P> This production initiates an admirable transatlantic lend-lease plan between Joseph Papp 's Public Theater and Britain 's Royal Court Theater . As might be expected , the entire cast is best-of-breed.
