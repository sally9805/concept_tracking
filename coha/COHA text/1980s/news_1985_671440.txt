Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the opinion for the Court . Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a concurring opinion . Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented. // // From the Opinion // // By Justice Marshall // The issue in this case is whether the Constitution requires that an indigent defendant have access to the psychiatric examination and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition , when his sanity at the time of the offense is seriously in question. // This Court has long recognized that when a state brings its judicial power to bear on an indigent defendant in a criminal proceeding , it must take steps to assure that the defendant has a fair opportunity to present his defense . This elementary principle , grounded in significant part on the 14th Amendment ' s due process guarantee of fundamental fairness , derives from the belief that justice can not be equal where , simply as a result of his poverty , a defendant is denied the opportunity to praticipate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courthouse doors does not by itself assure a proper functioning of the adversary process , and that a criminal trial is fundamentally unfair if the state proceeds against an indigent defendant without making certain that he has access to the raw materials integral to the building of an effective defense . To implement this principle , we have focused on identifying the " basic tools of an adequate defense or appeal , " and we have required that such tools be provided to those defendants who can not afford to pay for them. // In this case we must decide whether , and under what conditions , the participation of a psychiatrist is important enough to preparation of a defense to require the state to provide an indigent defendant with access to competent psychiatric assistance . <> <> Varied Interests Weighed // Three factors are relevant to this determination . The first is the private interest that will be affected by the action of the state . The second is the governmental interest that will be affected if the safeguard is to be provided . The third is the probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought , and the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the affected interest if those safeguards are not provided. // The private interest in the accuracy of a criminal proceeding that places an individual ' s life or liberty at risk is almost uniquely compelling . Indeed , the host of safeguards fashioned by this Court over the years to diminish the risk of erroneous conviction stands as a testament to that concern . The interest of the individual in the outcome of the state ' s effort to overcome the presumption of innocence is obvious and weighs heavily in our analysis. // We consider , next , the interest of the state . Oklahoma asserts that to provide Ake with psychiatric assistance on the record before us would result in a staggering burden to the state . We are unpersuaded by this assertion . Many states , as well as the Federal Government , currently make psychiatric assistance available to indigent defendants , and they have not found the financial burden so great as to preclude this assistance . This is especially so when the obligation of the state is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in many states , and as we limit the right we recognize today. // At the same time , it is difficult to identify any interest of the state , other than that in its economy , that weighs against recognition of this right . <> <> Probable Value of Assistance // Last , we inquire into the probable value of the psychiatric assistance sought , and the risk of error in the proceeding if such assistance is not offered . We begin by considering the pivotal role that psychiatry has come to play in criminal proceedings . More than 40 states , as well as the Federal Government , have decided either through legislation or judicial decision that indigent defendants are entitled , under certain circumstances , to the assistance of a psychiatrist ' s expertise. // These statutes and court decisions reflect a reality that we recognize today , namely , that when the state has made the defendant ' s mental condition relevant , the assistance of a psychiatrist may well be crucial . In this role , psychiatrists gather facts , that they will share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from it draw plausible conclusions about the defendant ' s mental condition , and about the effects of any disorder on behavior ; and they offer opinions about how the defendant ' s mental condition might have affected his behavior at the time in question . Through this process , psychiatrists ideally assist lay jurors to make a sensible and educated determination about the mental condition of the defendant at the time of the offense . <> <> Juries Still Find Facts // Perhaps because there often is no single , accurate psychiatric conclusion on legal insanity in a given case , juries remain the primary fact-finders on this issue , and they must resolve differences in opinion on the basis of the evidence offered by each party . When jurors make this determination about issues that inevitably are complex and foreign , the testimony of psychiatrists can be crucial and a virtual necessity if an insanity plea is to have any chance of success. // The foregoing leads inexorably to the conclusion that , without the assistance of a psychiatrist , the risk of an inaccurate resolution of sanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant is fairly able to present at least enough information to the jury to permit it to make a sensible determination. // We therefore hold that when a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial , the state must , at a minimum , assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist . This is not to say , of course , that the indigent defendant has a constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own . Our concern is that the indigent defendant have access to a competent psychiatrist for the purpose we have discussed , and as in the case of the provision of counsel we leave to the states the decision on how to implement this right . <> <> Sentencing Also an Issue // Ake also was denied the means of presenting evidence to rebut the state ' s evidence of his future dangerousness . The foregoing discussion compels a similar conclusion in the context of a capital sentencing. // This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the jury psychiatric testimony on the question of future dangerousness , see Barefoot v. Estelle ( 1983 ) , at least where the defendant has had access to an expert of his own . Without a psychiatrist ' s assistance , the defendant can not offer a well-informed expert ' s opposing view , and thereby loses a significant opportunity to raise in the jurors ' minds questions about the state ' s proof of an aggravating factor . In such a circumstance , where the consequence of error is so great , the relevance of responsive psychiatric testimony so evident , and the burden on the state so slim , due process requires access to a psychiatric examination on relevant issues , to the testimony of the psychiatrist , and to assistance in preparation at the sentencing phase. // We turn now to the facts of this case . On the record before us , it is clear that Ake ' s mental state at the time of the offense was a substantial factor in his defense . For one , Ake ' s sole defense was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so bizarre as to prompt the trial judge to have him examined for competency . Third , a state psychiatrist shortly thereafter found Ake to be incompetent to stand trial , and suggested that he be committed . Fourth , when he was found to be competent six weeks later , it was only on the condition that he be sedated with large doses of Thorazine three times a day , during trial . Fifth , the psychiatrists who examined Ake for competency described to the trial court the severity of Ake ' s mental illness less than six months after the offense , and suggested that his mental illness might have begun many years earlier . Finally , Oklahoma recognizes a defense of insanity. // Taken together , these factors make clear that the question of Ake ' s sanity was likely to be a significant factor in his defense. // In addition , Ake ' s future dangerousness was a significant factor at the sentencing phase . We therefore conclude that Ake also was entitled to the assistance of a psychiatrist on this issue and that the denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we reverse and remand for a new trial. // // By Chief Justice Burger , // // Concurring // The facts of the case and the question presented confine the actual holding of the Court . In capital cases the finality of the sentence imposed warrants protections that may or may not be required in other cases . Nothing in the Court ' s opinion reaches non-capital cases. // // From the Dissent // // By Justice Rehnquist // Before holding that the state is obligated to furnish the services of a psychiatric witness , I would require a considerably greater showing than this . And even then I do not think due process is violated merely because an indigent lacks sufficient funds to pursue a state-law defense as thoroughly as he would like . It is highly doubtful that due process requires a state to make available an insanity defense to a criminal defendant , but in any event if such a defense is afforded , the burden of proving insanity can be placed on the defendant . That is essentially what happened here , and Ake failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the Due Process Clause superimposes a Federal standard for determining how and when sanity can legitimately be placed in issue , and I would find no violation of due process under the circumstances. // Finally , even if I were to agree with the Court that some right to a state- appointed psychiatrist should be recognized here , I would not grant the broad right to " access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an approriate examination and assist in evaluation , preparation , and presentation of the defense . " A psychiatrist is not an attorney , whose job it is to advocate . His opinion is sought on a question that the State of Oklahoma treats as a question of fact . Since any " unfairness " in these cases would arise from the fact that the only competent witnesses on the question are being hired by the state , all the defendant should be entitled to is one competent opinion , whatever the witness ' s conclusion , from a psychiatrist who acts independently of the prosecutor ' s office . Although the independent psychiatrist should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trial , and to testify if called , I see no reason why the defendant should be entitled to an opposing view , or to a " defense " advocate. // //
