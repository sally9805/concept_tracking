The emerging consensus among analysts here is that the stabilization of Iran ' s chaotic revolution and the eventual release of 53 American hostages hinges not so much on who wins this peaking power struggle as on the necessity that someone win it outright. // " The major precondition for putting this country back together and for getting the hostages out , " commented a senior Western diplomat , " is that one party or another must be in a strong enough position to make decisions that will stick. " // There are three potential candidates for that role : Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , Iran ' s supreme and supremely elusive leader ; President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , " moderate , " Western educated , popular , and so far powerless ; and the rival , " hard-line " Islamic Republican Party ( IRP ) of Ayatollah Muhammad Beheshti. // Western diplomats would like to think that support from the Khomeini family in recent days for the Iranian President means that the Ayatollah has opened an all-out campaign to consolidate Mr. Bani-Sadr ' s authority. // For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobs that have provided insuperable muscle for Ayatollah Beheshti ' s challenge to the President ' s power. // " The masses can not govern the country , " Ayatollah Khomeini said from his Tehran home June 10 , " or there would be anarchy. " // The Ayatollah ' s son , Ahmad , went further June 14 . Ridiculing the mobs ' favored slogan , he told Iran ' s national news agency : " If ' there is no party but the party of Allah ' means beating up people , then they have discredited Allah. " // Ayatollah Khomeini ' s son-in-law , Shahabuddin Eshraqi , meanwhile has served warning that revolutionary Iran must begin to seek long-range stability . " God is with Bani-Sadr , " he said . " One must confirm him in authority. . . those who wish to crush Bani-Sadr and his like must know that society will crush them. " // Yet the nagging question for many diplomats and Iranian analysts is whether an aging , ailing , Ayatollah named Khomeini can change his spots. // With the traditional caveat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cannot. // Although never so forcefully , Ayatollah Khomeini in the past has offered explicit public support for his President . What the Ayatollah has not offered is the day-to-day political intervention needed to convert such words into practice. // In the tradition of Shiite Islamic teachers , he has preferred to remain above the fray , intervening only when forced to by events . The most recent such event was a violent June 12 clash between fundamentalist mobs and leftists after a Tehran political rally. // The Ayatollah ' s intervention consistently has taken the form of pronouncements , left for others to interpret and implement . Such pronouncements have not enabled Mr. Bani-Sadr to convert his landslide presidential victory into real political power. // A growing number of Tehran analysts now suggest that supremacy in the streets , in the mosques , and in a legislature given wide rein by Iran ' s new Constitution , makes eventual victory for Ayatollah Beheshti ' s IRP much more likely. // Western diplomats , pointing to occasionally " moderate " statements by Ayatollah Beheshti on the hostage question before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in keeping the captives in Iran has been to weaken Mr. Bani-Sadr ' s authority. // These diplomats , and Iranian analysts , suspect that should Ayatollah Beheshti win the power struggle outright , he would see the continued hostage-holding as a potential lever for challenging his own hold on the country. // In Iran ' s recently invested Majlis ( parliament ) , which Ayatollah Khomeini has charged with resolving the hostage issue , Ayatollah Beheshti commands the largest single voting block. // It is in parliament , over the choice of Mr. Bani-Sadr ' s prime minister , that the struggle between the President and Ayatollah Beheshti seems to be coming to a head. // The mastermind of Mr. Bani-Sadr ' s January presidential campaign said only days after the election that " it will be extremely dangerous if the first Majlis sets out to challenge the President , because the whole system will be paralyzed. " // He was right . The Constitution makes Iran ' s President " next in rank " to Ayatollah Khomeini but then says he can do just about nothing without parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleashing thinly veiled attacks on each other in their client newspapers , Mr. Bani-Sadr and Ayatollah Beheshti seem to have taken wildly divergent stands on the naming of revolutionary Iran ' s first head of government. // The President is understood to want one of his own supporters in the post , or at least a compromise candidate capable of defusing parliamentary challenges to his authority. // Ayatollah Beheshti has made it clear that , so far , he has no intention of playing ball. // That , in the view of most Tehran analysts , leaves three possibilities : // * Ayatollah Khomeini , if he were to change his spots , could impose a compromise candidate and forcefully direct Ayatollah Beheshti and his parliamentary colleagues to support him. // * President Bani-Sadr could bow to political realities , give in , and make the best of whatever limited authority he is conceded. // * Or Iran could end up with the political statemate foreseen by the President ' s campaign chief. // " Unless Ayatollah Khomeini suddenly brings everyone into line and keeps them there , " concluded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I think we must finally realize that a Bani-Sadr is impossible , and that a genuine consolidation of power by Ayatollah Beheshti is certainly the next best thing. // " The greatest danger in this power struggle  --  for Iran and for the hostages  --  is that no one at all may win. " // //
