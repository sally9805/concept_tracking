WASHINGTON  --  Stanley Brand says he represents legions of voiceless beer drinkers . " They ' re not organized , they don ' t have a lobbyist . . . . They need to be spoken for . " The message : Don ' t raise federal taxes on beer . Actually , Mr. Brand is a lobbyist for the brewing industry , but he doesn ' t spend much time hanging around House or Senate vestibules . He ' s organizing beer wholesalers , brewery suppliers and others in the beer industry into a coalition to speak , if not for consumers , at least against a beer-tax boost . Such industry groups are being used increasingly to sway Congress by stirring up voters to write , call or visit their representatives . As Mr. Brand puts it , " The most effective way to lobby isn ' t to lobby at all , it ' s to mobilize the natural constituencies that exist out there in the hinterlands . " A U.S. map in his downtown law offices bristles with colored pins marking the locations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities . A monthly newsletter reaches a growing membership list that includes beer wholesalers , bottle and can makers , malt suppliers and others whose income is tied to beer sales . Members of House and Senate tax-writing committees regularly drop by the coalition ' s monthly meetings to talk about budget and tax trends , pick up $2 , 000 appearance fees and see that the brewers are organizing . The coalition has enlisted the wine industry , and is courting distillers . Potentially , Mr. Brand envisions a vast , united front that could include tavern owners and perhaps even rank-and-file drinkers . There ' s talk of putting anti-tax tags on every six-pack , unfurling anti-tax " tent cards " on millions of tavern tables , pinning anti-tax buttons on bowling shirts in beer halls everywhere . One member even suggests commissioning a country-and-western song with an anti-beer tax theme . All this may seem a bit premature , as there hasn ' t been an increase in the 65-cent-a-case federal tax on beer since the Korean War , and nobody is seriously proposing one right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wine are the only " sin taxes " that haven ' t been increased recently . Last year , tax writers raised the federal tax on hard liquor by 19% , effective next Oct. 1 . And , in 1981 , they doubled the federal excise tax on cigarettes , to 16 cents a pack . More recently , bills have been introduced to increase tobacco and hard-liquor taxes even more , to help finance the troubled Medicaid system . Proponents argue that those products cause health problems that Medicaid pays for . Those ideas haven ' t included beer and haven ' t yet generated much interest in Congress , but the beer men worry still . " When people talk taxes , certain industries are singled out , " says Donald Shea , president of the U.S. Brewers Association . " We want to be prepared . " Among the first tasks was choosing a name . " We didn ' t want an acronym that sounded too cute , like ' Sixpac , ' " says Mr. Brand . Among those rejected were " Capet " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compete , " for " Coalition of Manufacturers for the Promotion of Excise Tax Equity . " The brewers finally settled on " COBI , " for " Coalition on Beverage Issues , " a misnomer because the group is formed around only one issue , taxes . As the brewers organize against a tax increase , others are getting ready , too . The tobacco industry has hired a bevy of high-priced Washington lawyers to help ensure that the temporary tax increase on cigarettes , scheduled to end Oct. 1 , doesn ' t become permanent . Theirs will be an uphill struggle , many say , because going back to an 8-cent-a-pack tax could reduce the government ' s income by about $2. 3 billion a year at a time when Congress is fretting about swollen budget deficits . Meanwhile , some tobacco-state lawmakers have broken ranks with the cigarette makers by proposing to use cigarette-tax income to finance the troubled system of federal price supports for tobacco growers . The looming tobacco-tax debate could spell trouble for brewers . " Any discussion of tobacco taxes usually opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brand says in the coalition ' s newsletter . But if any beer-tax proposal surfaces , Congress will start hearing from people such as Robert Snook , vice president of Minnesota Malting Co. , which supplies about five million bushels of malt  --  sprouted , dried barley  --  to brewers each year . He and his 50 employees " would certainly be getting our message to the senators and representatives of the state of Minnesota , " says Mr. Snook , who recently joined the coalition . Just hearing some talk about a beer-tax increase moved another coalition member , George Brown , a Louisiana beer wholesaler , to get his customers , colleagues and employees to write letters to the White House a few months ago . " I generated about 1 , 200 letters , I think , " Mr. Brown says . There isn ' t any sign that those letters were why President Reagan let beer taxes alone in his tax-simplification plan . But Mr. Brown says , " It ' s all a part of our great democracy ; let ' em know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tobacco Average Federal Average Yield Retail Excise State to U.S. Price Tax Excise Tax Treasury Cigarettes 97. 8 cents 16 cents 15. 35 cents $4. 75 per pack per pack* per pack billion of 20 Beer $9. 00 per 65 cents 41 cents $1. 51 case of per case per case billion 24 cans Wine $2. 30 per 3. 4 cents 10. 9 cents $320 750-ml per per million bottle bottle bottle Distilled $6. 59 per $1. 67 $1. 33 $3. 55 spirits 750-ml per per billion bottle of bottle** bottle 80-proof vodka *Goes down to eight cents Oct. 1 <> **Goes up to $1. 99 Oct. 1 Sources : Tobacco Institute , Coalition on Beverage Issues , Distilled Spirits Council Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
