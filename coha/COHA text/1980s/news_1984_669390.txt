The project is the building of an oil pipeline from Iraq through Jordan to the Red Sea port of Aqaba . Bechtel Group , the US construction and engineering firm , has applied to the Export-Import Bank for financing of the American portion of the $1 billion project . The request is expected to be acted upon soon. // ' ' Things are moving fast , ' ' says John Cooper , a Bechtel executive . ' ' Board action on a preliminary commitment could come in a week or so. ' ' // Administration officials see economic , political , and strategic benefits from the proposed project , which began to take shape seriously at the end of last year. // // * The pipeline would provide 1 million barrels of oil a day that did not have to go through the vulnerable Strait of Hormuz , increasing the security of Western oil supplies. // // * It would help make clear to Iran that it can not win a war of attrition against Iraq and thus offer incentive to end the war. // // * It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help Jordan , which would receive transit fees and the benefits of an expanded port. // // * It would enhance Iraq ' s interest in stability in the region , bringing it more into the Saudi-Jordan camp , and give both Iraq and Jordan incentive not to get involved in hostilities with Israel . Israel is said to be sympathetic to the project. // // * Not least of all , the pipeline would provide an estimated $500 million worth of business for US companies , creating jobs and improving the US balance of payments. // Even though US companies are less competitive than the West Europeans or Japanese , Jordan and Iraq recently asked for a larger US involvement in the project . This seems to reflect their desire to batten down the American presence for political and strategic reasons ; in other words , the pipeline ' s proximity to Israel. // ' ' They wanted a major US involvement of about 50 percent , ' ' Mr. Cooper says . ' ' So this is an opportunity for American suppliers to be involved in a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Japan , and others. ' ' // Administration officials maintain that the US is not ' ' tilting ' ' toward Iraq in the Gulf conflict . Richard W. Murphy , an assistant secretary of state for Near East and South Asian affairs , told Congress this week that ' ' a victory by either side is neither militarily achievable nor strategically desirable. ' ' // But diplomatic and academic experts see a definite US sympathy with Iraq now because Iraq seeks a negotiated settlement of the dispute . As regional and international pressure builds against Iran , the administration has intensified its jawboning of Britain , South Korea , Italy , Israel , and others to halt the supply of arms to Iran . No similar pressure is being applied to countries supplying arms to Iraq , US officials say. // ' ' The United States and the Soviet Union are both taking a more benevolent look at Iraq now , ' ' says Christine Helms , a scholar at the Brookings Institution . ' ' They have no hope in the near future of establishing relations with Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' // The Iran-Iraq war is a concern not merely for economic reasons but because of the danger of the spread of Islamic fundamentalism should Iran be victorious . Already Middle East specialists see considerable Iranian-inspired activity aimed at subversion of existing governments . Kuwait , for instance , last week arrested four Iranian fundamentalists suspected of forming a sabotage network. // The Iraq-Jordan pipeline is not the only project under consideration . Brown &; Root , another US engineering company , has contracted with Iraq to do the engineering and management work for construction of a line from the Rumaila field in Iraq southward to the Trans-Saudi pipeline , which also terminates at the Red Sea . A second phase of the plan would involve building a parallel pipeline to the Saudi Arabian line. // Brown &; Root officials say bid documents for Phase 1 of the project , expected to cost in the vicinity of $700 million , will be released soon . No formal request has been made to the Export-Import Bank for financing , officials say , but some discussions with the bank have taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The US is interested in these projects because Iraqi oil would be shipped through the Red Sea and thus not be subject to interdiction in the Gulf. // Moreover , the 600-mile-long Iraq-Jordan pipeline , which could be built in about 18 months , would pay for itself in two or three years. // ' ' The real benefit would be that it would change the expectations on vulnerability of oil , ' ' says a State Department official . ' ' A significant amount of oil could be moved without traveling through the Gulf. ' ' // ' ' But it would also send a signal to Iran and may encourage them to take a lower-risk strategy , ' ' adds the official. // Bechtel Group , the leading firm in the proposed project , would also contract with West German , British , French , and other suppliers. // Where US exporters are concerned , the Export-Import Bank will make the financing decision on the basis of economic factors , including ' ' reasonable assurance of repayments , ' ' as the bank ' s congressional mandate puts it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the bank appears to be looking for an especially strong source of security in the case of Iraq . Iraq , for instance , could insure the whole pipeline or put the oil revenues into an escrow account . Another possibility is to have outside oil users offer guarantees. // Experts on the Middle East point out that Iraq , although it , like Iran , has an authoritarian regime distasteful to many outsiders , is becoming an increasingly important state . Historically , it was always one of the dominant Arab powers in the area , together with Syria and Egypt . But in the recent period the pendulum has swung to the oil-rich countries of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and other Gulf states. // Still , experts say , Iraq alone possesses the oil and the most precious nonoil resource - water - to enable it to have a diversified economy . It therefore has an edge over Egypt and Syria in the pursuit of influence in the region. // //                @ @ @ @ @
