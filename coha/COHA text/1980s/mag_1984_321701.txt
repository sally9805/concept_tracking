" Bad management has shot down more airplanes , sunk more ships and immobilized more soldiers than all our enemies in history put together , " the witness told the crowded Senate hearing room last week . Pentagon Whistle Blower A. Ernest Fitzgerald , a management systems deputy for the Air Force , had been called to testify before Iowa Senator Charles Grassley 's Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure . Fitzgerald , fired in 1970 after he disclosed huge cost overruns on the Lockheed C-5A military transport , was restored to his original Pentagon job in 1982 under court order . He complained to the Senate panel that he has been denied access to data needed to perform his duties , a charge that the Air Force denied . <P> Fitzgerald also testified that on a 1982 tour of a Hughes Aircraft plant in Tucson , he discovered that the company was taking 17.2 hours to do what its own engineers said should take one hour to accomplish in the production of the $892,000 infrared imaging Maverick missile . A Hughes spokesman said Fitzgerald 's assertion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30% waste in most military contracts . His calculation of the cost to taxpayers : as much as $30 billion a year .
