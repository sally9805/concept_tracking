The class of ' 83 faces the worst job prospects since World War II <P> For graduating seniors at Northwestern University , the small room tucked away in one of the administration buildings has been a popular spot on campus . There , twice a week , a group of students known as the job club gathers to swap leads , vent frustrations and talk of how to get someone to hire them in this year 's tight job market . They even practice the art of shaking the hand of a recruiter in a convincing way . " I 'm confused , " says Margaret Berger , an English major who can not find a job in her chosen field of communications . " I always thought an education would mean something . " <P> So did most of this year 's 965,000 college seniors , the largest class ever , who are having a difficult time finding work in an economy that is slowly recovering from the recession . Says Thomas C. Devlin , director of Cornell University 's career center : " The American dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other has been deteriorating . " Wayne Wallace , placement director at Indiana University in Bloomington , predicts , " This year is probably going to be the most difficult for college grads since World War II . " <P> In the booming economy of 20 years ago , only about 500,000 students graduated from college annually . With national unemployment at just 5% or so , jobs for college grads were plentiful . This year , according to Victor Lindquist , co-author of Northwestern University 's Endicott Study on College Placement , about one-third of the graduates will leave campus without jobs . Indeed , there has been an estimated 50% drop in offers made by employers since last year . At Indiana , for example , the administration estimates that fully half of its 7,000 graduates getting their bachelor 's degrees will not have positions at commencement . Says Jack Shingleton , placement director at Michigan State University : " The universities are turning out more graduates than our society is able to absorb . " <P> The number of on-campus recruiting interviews this year is down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The University of Pennsylvania , for instance , had 800 recruiters in 1981 ; in 1982 there were 620 , and this year only 565 . If the economic recovery persists , prospects should improve in 1984 , but long-range predictions for employment of college grads remain gloomy . The Federal Government 's Scientific Manpower Commission predicts that in 1992 there will be 3.3 million more graduates than jobs requiring a college education . <P> The seniors most in demand by corporations this year are those who majored in electrical engineering , computer science and accounting . But even a diploma in those fields does not guarantee a paycheck , as in the recent past . This year the market for engineers , once booming , is down 18% from 1982 . Cutbacks by oil companies have dried up opportunities for chemical engineers . In 1970 the geology department at the University of Texas at Arlington had three graduate students and all were hired . Then students flocked to geology as the search for oil quickened . This year , with an oil glut , only two out of Arlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have jobs .
