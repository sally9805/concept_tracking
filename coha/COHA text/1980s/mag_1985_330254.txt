Few struggles in American industry are fiercer than the one now being waged between the Davids and Goliaths of the banking world . As such giants as Citicorp , Chase Manhattan and Bank of America press their campaign for unlimited interstate banking , smaller lenders are fighting back . Last week the Supreme Court dealt the big guys a major blow . In an 8-to-0 vote , the court ruled that local institutions can form regional networks that shut out larger rivals based in other states . <P> The decision upheld the so-called New England Compact , which allows mergers across state lines by banks in the region . With the court 's verdict , Bank of Boston ( 1984 assets : $22.1 billion ) , New England 's No. 1 lender , will now acquire Colonial Bancorp of Waterbury , Conn. ( assets $1.5 billion ) , and RIHT Financial Corp . ( assets $2.3 billion ) of Providence for about $200 million . Said a disappointed Hans Angermueller , vice chairman of Citicorp ( assets $150.1 billion ) , which led the legal fight against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still enjoys local protection . " <P> Fourteen states , mainly in the Northeast and South , have laws allowing regional banks to join forces . Specifically locked out of the agreements are New York and California , home to the biggest U.S. banks . The court action seems certain to spur new mergers between regional institutions . In the South , the decision immediately cleared the way for Citizens &; Southern ( assets $8 billion ) , Georgia 's largest bank-holding company , to acquire Landmark Banking Corp . ( assets $3.8 billion ) . Harry Keefe Jr. , chairman of the Wall Street brokerage firm of Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods , predicts that the pace of acquisitions will accelerate . " There are only 22 institutions with assets of $20 billion or more , " he notes . " That figure should double in the next five years . " <P> The focus of the big banks ' drive to enter new territory will now shift to Congress . The large financial companies are pinning their hopes on a bill that will open regional arrangements to all banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a trigger date , after which the barriers against outsiders will be dropped . The legislation was approved last week by the House Banking Committee . Said William Dabaghi , general counsel to the Coalition for Regional Banking and Economic Development , which represents medium-size lenders : " Unfortunately , our opponents did their homework and managed to convince a number of the swing voters on the committee to go along with the trigger . " <P> But not all the news from Capitol Hill was good for the major financial institutions . In a separate action , the House panel voted to close a legal loophole that has allowed banks to expand across state lines by setting up so- called limited-service branches . Such facilities either make commercial loans or accept deposits , but not both . Thus they evade statutes that bar interstate banking . <P> These restricted operations were attacked last month by a federal court in Atlanta . The court decided that they are in effect banks and therefore subject to the same regulations as banks . If upheld , the decision will prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already exist .
