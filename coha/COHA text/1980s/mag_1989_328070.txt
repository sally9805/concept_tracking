It is no secret who holds Terry Anderson . Imad Mughniyah is his name . He is a 38-year-old Lebanese leader of the Shi'ite fundamentalist group Hizballah whose history of terrorism is grislier than the record of Palestinian renegade Abu Nidal . Mughniyah 's villainy , U.S. officials say , runs from bombings , like the suicide attacks on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut , to hijackings . He is a prime suspect in the U.S. for his alleged role in the 1985 skyjacking of TWA Flight 847 in which a Navy diver was murdered . And he has made a specialty of kidnaping : U.S. officials believe that Mughniyah , under the cloak of cover names like Islamic Jihad and the Revolutionary Justice Organization , has been involved in the kidnaping of at least 31 Westerners since 1984 and that he continues to hold most of the 13 still in captivity . <P> The kidnapers specifically wanted Terry Anderson . Fatefully , perhaps , the reporter advertised his availability the day before his capture , when he ventured into Beirut 's southern suburbs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson 's colleagues at the Associated Press believe he may have put himself on Hizballah 's blacklist as far back as 1983 , when he traveled to their stronghold in Baalbek to grill Shi'ite leaders about the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks . <P> The grandson of a Shi'ite mullah , Mughniyah trained with Yasser Arafat 's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization . A high school dropout , he excelled at terrorism ; his boldness and quick grasp of explosives and weaponry impressed his commanders . But he fell out with Fatah leaders and in 1982 , when Israeli troops invaded Lebanon and occupied his village , Teir Debbe , Mughniyah joined the newly formed and more radical Hizballah ( Party of God ) . He took to wearing religious garb even as he recruited activists and professionals to the Shi'ite cause . He rose quickly to the top of the organization , and as security chief , Mughniyah is thought to be the group 's most powerful figure . He continues to hold the Westerners captive despite public pleas from Fadlallah that they be set free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shi'ites in Lebanon and to vent his hatred of the U.S. and Israel . But U.S. sources say he has become obsessed with trying to secure the freedom of his brother-in-law Mustafa Badreddin and 16 other Shi'ites jailed in Kuwait after a 1983 bombing blitz . Mughniyah launched his subsequent kidnaping and hijacking spree to spring the 17 in a prisoners-for-hostages swap . Among his victims : William Buckley , the CIA station chief , who died in captivity . <P> Mughniyah reportedly gets his financing from Tehran , and is considered Iran 's man in Lebanon ; his closest mentors there include conservative leaders locked in rivalry with Iran 's would-be pragmatists . Even so , Mughniyah has been forced to free numerous American , French and West German hostages when it served Iran 's interests , while his personal demands have never been met . <P> Mughniyah seems content to bide his time until the U.S. breaks . But he has not tired of finding ways to press Hizballah 's confrontation with the West . Britain 's Guardian newspaper reported last month that he was busy organizing mass demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death for writing The Satanic Verses .
