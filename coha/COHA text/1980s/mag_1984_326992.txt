When Socialite Lilly Pulitzer started selling flower-splattered print dresses in a Palm Beach , Fla. , shop in 1962 , her designs quickly caught the fancy of wealthy matrons from Bel Air , Calif. , to Bar Harbor , Me . Pulitzer 's trademark pink-and-green styles became the epitome of preppiedom and led to the opening of 33 boutiques across the country . But after nearly two decades of cachet , Pulitzer has fallen out of style and into the red . Last week her company , which had sales of more than $10 million a year in its heyday , filed for bankruptcy in order to receive protection from creditors . The firm will close six of its 26 remaining shops . <P> Pulitzer launched her venture while married to Newspaper Heir Peter Pulitzer , who made headlines in 1982 during a sensational divorce from his third wife , Roxanne . Lilly and Peter were divorced in 1969 . Pulitzer tried to keep her fashions up to date over the past few years by switching to more formal , darker colors . But the designer was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of today 's smart set .
