To the Editors : <P> If we are disturbed by the moral malaise in the U.S. ( ( ETHICS , May 25 ) ) , perhaps we should check American attitudes to find the root of the problem . The American dream of the " good life , " a label for our unchecked individualism , has led us to a state where opportunities have become rights and rights have become untouchable . Religion and morality are maintained not as guideposts of conduct but as props to make us look as if we were the good folks . <P> Mark Franceschini <P> Westminster , Colo . <P> After Nicaragua appeared before the World Court and charged the U.S. with mining its harbors , the Reagan Administration refused to accept the court 's order to desist . Considering the atmosphere created by the Government , should we be surprised with the ethics of those in the Administration who have gone astray ? <P> James H. Arvanites <P> Watertown , N.Y . <P> I do not believe it is immoral to rip off the Ayatullah and send the profits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist base in North America . If readers were to believe every word TIME published , they would think President Reagan was responsible for each scandal that happened . When you write about the President and his ethics , remember what this country was like when he took office . <P> David James <P> Irvine , Calif . <P> People are not becoming more evil but more perfect . The events and behavior you cite as evidence of questionable ethics simply reflect our increased awareness of evil through the technology of instant global communications . Any public lapse of morals is now known instantly and responded to with outrage and a demand for perfection . To me , this represents an improvement in our situation . <P> David Crane <P> Wheaton , Ill . <P> You did not mention that being honest is back in style . Unethical behavior is less tolerated today ; hence many dubious activities that were once ignored are at last being confronted and corrected . Self-indulgence is not unique to " America 's national character , " as you imply . It is a characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> I could not agree with you more that ethics and morals have hit a new low . Every part of society seems to have been tarnished . Scandals in religion , the military , corporations and , of course , the government . Drugs everywhere . But when was the last time a case of corruption or drug abuse was reported concerning the media ? Keep up the pompous work . <P> Jeffrey Luke Brown <P> Albuquerque <P> Your article " Morality Among the Supply-Siders " is a misnomer . The word supply-side pertains to economics and the economics of incentives . There was not one economist  --  let alone a supply-side economist  --  listed in your rogues ' gallery . Why you chose to besmirch the name supply-side in this totally inappropriate context is beyond me . <P> Arthur B. Laffer <P> Lomita , Calif . <P> When the White House fosters the violation of our laws , when a TV minister makes a mockery of the teachings of Christ , I do not see how our President can then refer to the Soviet Union as a godless nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> George H.
