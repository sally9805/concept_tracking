Much contemporary rural poetry is accessible to readers anywhere . Who , for example , could fail to comprehend the melancholy lines of Dave Smith , a poet with ' ' pine seed in my nose , ' ' who finds himself , through no apparent fault of his own , walking the streets of Chicago , when where he really wants to be is back in the rural South ? As he laments , ' ' My life lies loose like lint in my pocket ' ' - a pretty good description of the consequences of rural-to-urban displacement. // And what rural citizen would not affirm the feelings of James A. Autrey , another displaced villager , who keeps wondering , ' ' while sipping something chic and soda ' ' at a citified cocktail party , // // which of these ladies would bring // a covered dish and a quart of tea // to set among the prayers and songs // on the dinner grounds in the pine // grove. // // Prayers and songs , casseroles and incantations - the lost joys of ruralism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostalgia to offer . Even its reminiscent side speaks to the future , to a vision of America that contains the best and most enduring features of ruralism . ' ' America , ' ' Smith cries , ' ' sing to me now as you always claimed you would . . . . ' ' He is speaking about generosity and community , about prayers and songs that might exorcise the lint from his life . In short , he is a poet in search of meaning , which is why he looks to his rural roots. // But don ' t all poets , urban no less than rural , look to their roots ? Well , yes , now perhaps they do - but for rural poets this rooting about is a relatively new phenomenon . In the dark ages of American rural poetry - that is , before the dawn of rural consciousness - we had something quite different. // The industrialization of America had a baneful effect on the morale of rural residents . They saw urban rule as the wave of the future , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past. // The rural poetry that got written back then - I ' m talking about after the Civil War - is what critics now call ' ' genteel ' ' verse . It romanticized the past while keeping a discreet silence about both the present and the future . If there is such a thing as ' ' false consciousness , ' ' there may also be a false nostalgia - of the sort , perhaps that was practiced by James Whitcomb Riley , with his backward glances and folksy misspellings . Just two of his many forgettable lines will suffice here : // // Let ' s go a-visitin ' to Griggsby ' s // Station - // Back where we ust to be so happy // and so pore ! // // Riley himself was pretty rich but , in his view of things , rural happiness and rural poverty went together . You couldn ' t have one without the other. // By the early 20th century , rural nostalgia had given way to something more biting and more bitter - the first sign of incipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like their small towns . They didn ' t want to be where they were . To Edward Arlington Robinson , the routines and rhythms of small-town life were as ' ' Familiar as an old mistake , / And futile as regret. ' ' // In those times that seemed so hard , and in those places that seemed so petty and mean-spirited , self-disparagement was a natural response . Edgar Lee Masters even mocked small-town poetry : // // Seeds in a dry pod , tick , tick , tick , // Tick , tick , tick , what little iambics // While Homer and Whitman roared // in the pines ! // // ( Poets always seem to have pine seed in their noses ! ) // What rural poets were facing in those days was a demographic disaster of historic proportions . Millions of young people were abandoning their farms and villages and seeking jobs or excitement in the cities . ' ' The farmhouse lights are going out all over America , ' ' lamented the president of the National Farmers Organization . ' ' Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets battle the urban tide . Vachel Lindsay tried the hardest , going on foot from town to town , reciting his poems in praise of village life and dreamily prophesying a cul-tural rebirth that would someday transform small-town America. // But the national mood was metropolitan - bigger was better - and most of the major poets preferred city lights to harvest moons. // Then a funny thing happened to rural America on its way to extinction . In the late 1960s it began to enjoy a demographic comeback , one that persists to this day . The 1980 census shows the rural sector growing at a faster rate than its metropolitan counterpart for the first time in 160 years. // It would be unwise to see in all this the stirrings of a ' ' back-to-the-land ' ' movement , since the actual direction taken thus far has been nonagricultural. // ' ' We have a new distribution of people upon the land , ' ' writes Howard F. Conklin , professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University , ' ' one that has never before existed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which non-farm people live in the country , far outnumbering farmers in most rural communities. ' ' // Poets , of course , have been part of that new distribution ; and their works , in my judgment , reflect the new rural consciousness . The dimensions of renewal appear broad and generous , covering a variety of groups and ethnicities . Blacks in the South share in it , as do Hispanics in the Southwest and Native Americans throughout the country . A 1978 anthology titled ' ' On Turtle ' s Back ' ' includes more than 100 rural poets , all from upstate New York . A recently published bibliography of ' ' Contemporary Appalachian Poetry ' ' lists 122 works produced by 88 poets. // The listings can be taken as signs of a desire among rural residents to make their local affections memorable and explicit . Writes Michael McClure in ' ' At Night on the River ' ' : // Let // us // prepare // to love this place // before we leave it . . . // The Nebraska poet John McKernan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls ' ' The truly great works of man ' ' : ' ' pouring milk into buckets of wood/ gathering long sheaves of prickling wheat . . . / planting cabbage and garlic in the garden/ gathering the globed pear the parsley sprig. ' ' // Rural poets can extol the commonplace simply by calling it to our attention - even though the subjects may be beneath urban notice . This is a point not lost on poets like William Stafford , who loves to mock city ways as he quietly praises rural life . In a poem titled ' ' Things I Learned Last Week , ' ' Stafford is full of valuable information. // Ants , when they meet each other , // usually pass on the right . . . // A man in Boston has dedicated // himself // to telling about injustice. // For three-thousand dollars he will // come to your town and tell you // about it. // // Though one should not read too much into Stafford ' s wry lines , it seems safe to say that he writes from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston man asking $3 , 000 to tell villagers about injustice draws some of its power from the familiar status of rural people . After all , when it comes to injustice , they wrote the book. // If rural poets are getting self-conscious about their rurality , can the rest of us be far behind ? ' ' Poetry , ' ' said Carl Sandburg , ' ' is the achievement of the synthesis of hyacinths and biscuits. ' ' // It is now possible to say ' ' rural is beautiful ' ' and mean both the biscuits and the hyacinths , the life people live as well as the aesthetics they absorb . That life comes replete with its own values and rhythms . It requires no apologies and no lament for the lint that lies loose in one ' s pockets . It is the stuff of poetry. // //
