A group of personal-computer companies known as the Gang of Nine demonstrated a chip set that rivals International Business Machines Corp. ' s Micro Channel , meaning the two sides remain on course for a collision late this year . In the nine months since the group announced the outlines of its plans , IBM has built some enthusiasm in the industry for the Micro Channel , the data pathway that is the distinguishing feature of IBM ' s PS/2 line and that IBM is pushing as an industry standard . But yesterday ' s announcement represents an intensification of the battle by the Gang of Nine , whose rival pathway is known formally as the Extended Industry Standard Architecture , or EISA . " We ' ll see a large number of EISA boxes no later than the Comdex trade show in November , " said Paul Otellini , general manager of the Folsom Microcomputer division at Intel Corp. , which developed the series of chips . Intel said it is working with 20 companies that are designing EISA machines . It said that sample chip sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michael Swavely , president of the North America division of Gang of Nine member Compaq Computer Corp. , added that numerous so-called bus master cards will be available when the EISA machines are . That ' s important because IBM has several of the cards available and has made them a focus of the debate on the merits of the controversial Micro Channel . The cards allow for much more powerful personal computers because they cram more processors into the box . Someone who needed a machine to supply data to a whole network of personal computers , for instance , could pack numerous high-speed disk drives into the machine and have bus master cards control them ; having the central processor do all the coordination would make the machine too slow . " I think you ' ll find that when the first EISA systems are delivered late this year , there will be as many bus master cards as there are for the Micro Channel , " Mr. Swavely said . IBM has been winning converts , at least among consultants and analysts , for its contention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because personal computers are becoming so powerful . Old circuit boards can ' t be used with the Micro Channel , but IBM has argued that few boards are moved from old machines to new ones anyway . IBM also achieved a public-relations coup recently by beating rivals to the punch with an announcement of a circuit board that lets customers upgrade existing machines to use Intel ' s new 486 processor . In addition , IBM said recently that personal-computer sales have been 40% higher than a year earlier , far faster growth than had been expected . But Mr. Swavely insisted that EISA was still on track . He said market-research firms ' data don ' t support analysts ' recent optimism about the Micro Channel . Indeed , StoreBoard Inc. said IBM ' s share of U.S. personal-computer revenue in computer stores fell to 30. 5% in the first quarter from 32. 5% last year , and slipped further to 28. 8% in April and 29. 9% in May . The firm said the Micro Channel ' s share of the total market fell to 22. 4% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 21% in April and 22. 1% in May . Mr. Swavely also noted that IBM announced the 486 product far in advance of its ability to deliver it and said that some of IBM ' s other claims indicate it is straining to find good news .
