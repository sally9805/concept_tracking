// Next April , Sally Ride will become the first woman to fly aboard an American spacecraft . With the launching of the seventh flight of the space shuttle , this slender 31-year-old woman from Encino , California , will remind girls and women everywhere that being an astronaut is a goal within reach . Ride , a physicist , recalls her own professional outlook as a child . " I was interested in space , " she says , but it was n't anything I built a career around . Instead I planned to go into research in physics . " She smiles and continues . " I would n't have known how to prepare for a career as an astronaut even if it had occurred to me to try , since women were n't involved in the space program at the time . " Mary Cleave , a 35-year-old astronaut and environmental engineer from Great Neck , New York , laughs heartily as she relates how reporters often ask her whether . as a child , she wished to be like John Glenn . " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's this little girl looking at a strong , crew-cut pilot and saying , ' I want to be just like him ! ' I think my parents would 've taken me straight to a psychologist ! " But others among the eight American women astronauts longed specifically to be astronauts from an early age . Bonnie Dunbar admits that as she was growing up on a farm outside Sunnyside , Washington , she had big dreams . " I loved science , and I was always interested in the space program , " she says . " My generation grew up with space flight as part of the environment . So I could see myself as a jet pilot , a scientist  --  even flying in a spacecraft . " I was a bit of a dreamer , " she says with a shrug . Anna Fisher , who 's 33 and an M.D. , was also space-struck from early childhood . " I decided to go into medicine because I could conceive of space stations being put into orbit , " she says , " and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible for women to fly in space within my // lifetime was astounding ! " Shannon Lucid admired the pioneer women of the American West when she was a little girl . She says , " I thought I wanted to be an explorer , but then I realized that the earth had already been pretty much explored , and there was n't a whole lot left . I loved to read , and during elementary school , I started reading about Robert Goddard and the rockets he was developing . So I guess my interest in the space program was just a natural outgrowth from that . " Lucid was undaunted by the fact that she had no role models . " I was about a fifth- or sixth-grader when I decided I wanted to be an astronaut , " she says . " A long time before America even had a manned space program , I was very interested in space flight . I was just hoping the government would get interested . " Meantime , " she concludes , " I logged more than 1,700 hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door was open for women to apply to the astronaut corps , I was ready . " Prior to 1978 , the astronaut corps was limited to an elite group of highly skilled , military-trained pilots  --  all men . But as shuttle plans advanced , NASA could see the need for a new kind of astronaut . Called Mission Specialists , these new astronauts would be selected from among the country 's top scientists , engineers and physicians . Of 8,079 applicants who underwent the physically taxing and intensely competitive selection process for Mission Specialist in 1978 , a whopping 1,544 were women . As the cuts were made , a pool of women emerged , and all were tops in their fields , highly educated , competitive , adventuresome . They were also technologically adept . Only six women were finally selected : Rhea Seddon , Anna Fisher , Shannon Lucid , Judy Resnik , Kathryn Sullivan and Sally Ride . Included in their number are two M.D.s , an electrical engineer and three scientists . All have earned doctorates . In 1980 , these six were joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission into the corps of 17 astronauts . Says Rhea Seddon , M.D. , from Murfreesboro , Tennessee , " I think the reason NASA took a large group in 1978 is that they could see how pretty soon they would need more people  --  especially if the shuttle flew as often as they were hoping . They could see that they were going to need lots and lots of people , both to work on the shuttle here on the ground and to be trained to fly it in space . " It 's a very complicated vehicle . It 's not something that you could come in and spend a year and know how to fly . " Rhea Seddon and Anna Fisher , as M.D.s , comprise a quarter of the eight-physician astronaut corps . Seddon , with four years of postgraduate training and surgery , and Fisher , who is an emergency-room doctor , keep their hands in the medical profession by working ER shifts in Houston-area hospitals . " This is good practice for giving medical care at launching and landing , " says Seddon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1973 . " You see , in launch or landing , there are a number of things that might go wrong , requiring medical attention . For example , the crew could eject from the craft , or the craft could crash land . So each landing site or potential landing site has rescue helicopters available , similar to the search and rescue facilities at military bases . " Anna and I have been trained to ride in those helicopters , along with a pararescue team , " she goes on . " The helicopters are stocked with all the best emergency equipment . In training exercises , we try to simulate situations that could actually happen . We ' rescue ' uniformed dummies , perform emergency procedures on them in shaky , noisy helicopters and then get them to our back-up trauma centers . " In addition to the astronaut doctors , NASA has a corps of private physicians on call during a shuttle landing and launch . There are also the crew surgeons and elaborate back-up emergency systems , including trauma facilities , near the Cape , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sands , New Mexico . Explains Anna Fisher , who has specialized in emergency-room medicine since her graduation from the University of California , Los Angeles , Medical School in 1976 , " Any shuttle injury would be unusual because of the high rate of speed at which the shuttle travels and because of the toxic chemicals used aboard the craft . Although we never expect anything to go wrong , we try to be prepared in case it does . " Recently , as they were returning from a practice maneuver in Florida , Fisher and her husband William Fisher , also an M.D. , were glad for their emergency medical training . " We happened on a motorcycle accident , " Anna explained , " and the victim was pretty well gone . We worked on him and worked on him , aided in great part by the paramedics in the ambulance . Finally , he seemed to be revived , and he was taken to a nearby emergency center . " NASA has high hopes for the shuttle : putting satellites into space , retrieving ailing satellites for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manipulator System , conducting scientific experiments in an atmosphere of microgravity  --  even developing new medicines in space . All this will be accomplished with a reusable spacecraft , and ultimately , it 's hoped , with a turnaround time of as little as two weeks . The spacecraft itself has been developed to the point that it 's operated largely by computer from the ground . Therefore , those finely honed pilot skills formerly so critical to an astronaut are no longer vital . What is needed more than upper-body strength or flying experience are the technical skills to monitor and interpret the on-board scientific experiments . Perhaps because space flight is such a fantasy , the stuff of science fiction , a swirl of excited public interest has accompanied the women astronauts since the beginning . Why the women in particular ? Maybe because they are breaking an old barrier for younger women . With Sally Ride 's April ascent into space , it will become apparent that  --  potentially , at least  --  space travel is for everyone . Meanwhile , the women astronauts hold to the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting jobs , and they want to be treated like everybody else in the corps . " We do the same work as our male colleagues , " explains Shannon Lucid , biochemist from Oklahoma , " yet nobody asks them about their families , or how their kids feel about their work . " She pauses . " When NASA started accepting scientists into the program , they were n't looking for a woman per se , or for an astrophysicist or an M.D. per se . They were just looking for people who had gone through school and gotten that much training . " I guess they figure you 're educable in other technological areas if you 're sufficiently qualified as a scientist in your own field . And that does n't have anything to do with being a woman or a wife or a mother . " Only three of the women are married . Lucid is , and she has three children . Rhea Seddon , who married fellow astronaut Robert Gibson in 1981 and recently had her first baby , is similarly disinclined to assume the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems as any working mother , " she says . " We 're not special . " Says Anna Fisher , " We go to work in the morning , just like any other scientists . When you 're on the outside looking in , our work looks glamorous . But once you 're involved in the kind of things we 're doing , it has a certain routine . " Continued on page 108 Ladies in Space continued from page 45 Fisher concludes , " Our work has its exciting parts , but it 's also tedious sometimes . " Astronauts rotate assignments about every year . They may be working in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory , or SAIL , where the most minute part of the shuttle is studied and is use simulated by computer . Or an astronaut might be assigned to work on the spacesuit for a year , or to research and perfect the " Potty System " on board the craft . Only when an astronaut is assigned to a shuttle flight does he or she begin what is called Mission Specific Training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly , is currently preparing for her flight in April . " We 'll be trying to assimilate the entire flight in advance by computer , " Ride explains . " This is intense training . We 'll aim to be prepared for anything that might come up . " It is , of course , imperative that an astronaut be in top physical condition during a flight , and the astronauts were put through grueling tests before they were selected . " We literally ran until we could n't run anymore , " says Mary Cleave , who is 5 ' 2 " tall and weighs 90 pounds . " They hooked us up to a respirometer and a cardiogram , and we got on the treadmill and ran . It was a maximum stress test , and everything was pouring out onto these computer sheets . They tested our strength , and they generally made sure we were healthy . Then , once we were selected , it was up to us to stay at that level of fitness . " The astronauts undergo physical exams periodically in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve fitness is up to them . They have excellent gym facilities that are available to them at any time . Many of the women run , some play racquetball , and all maintain an ideal weight . But there is no regimented daily fitness routine . " We just work it into our schedules , " says Cleave . Another thing the astronauts have to work into their schedules is fame . Although they are generally serious about their work and guarded about their private lives , the women astronauts are constantly in the public eye . People want to meet them , shake their hands , read about them . The astronauts rub shoulders with royalty , are scrutinized by the press and studied by the public . And while the glittery aspect of their careers must be endured  --  NASA does depend , after all , on public confidence and the tax dollar  --  the astronauts remain scrupulously unimpressed with their national status . " Astronauts are astronauts because it 's fun , " says Mary Cleave . " We 're not in this for money or fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly in space . " Are they ever afraid ? " Fear ? " says Cleave , laughing . " 1 ca n't wait to get into one of those birds . There 's a fine line between fear and exhilaration , and I 've always enjoyed activities where you get on that razor 's edge . " For the millions of people who will watch next April when the first woman takes off , the razor 's edge will have to be imagined . Through television coverage and reading , though , and with close observation , it might be possible for a girl of , say , 11 , to mentally put herself behind the controls of the space shuttle . She may even imagine herself soaring through space in Sally Ride 's place . It 's possible , after all . " I wanted to be an astronaut as a child , but I never thought it was possible , " says Ride . " Now that I 'm in this position , I do think it 's important that girls see me as a role model . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's most gratifying about the public part of this job . When I go out and give talks at schools and an eight-year-old girl in the audience raises her hand to ask me what she needs to do to become an astronaut , 1 like that . It 's neat ! " Why ? " muses Ride . " Because now there really is a way . Now it 's possible ! "
