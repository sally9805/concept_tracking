Wowing big groups and small , Ferraro is suddenly a heroine <P> Just a few days earlier she could go practically anywhere without being recognized , much less causing a stir . But in San Francisco last week Geraldine Ferraro was a mobile media event , her every public move and utterance analyzed for substance and style . Citizens thronged around her , and politicians of every color and creed embraced her . Some women cried as they touched her . <P> The extreme attention was natural . No woman had ever before run for national office on the ticket of a major party , and everybody wanted a closeup look at the pioneer . All week long she seemed at ease in the spotlight . Despite a few iffy moments , Ferraro held her own with the press . With partisan audiences she was unerring : in appearance after appearance she shrewdly ingratiated herself with the various sectors of the Democratic coalition , showing a rapid-fire fluency in the kind of person-to-person political happy talk that will be required for the next 15 weeks of campaigning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most matters to the vastly superior campaign expertise of the high-powered Mondale staff . When the week began , she was encamped in a 35th-floor Meridien Hotel suite , down the hall from her running mate , and her principal day-to-day operatives were mostly Mondale transfers . " I have these wonderful men who push me in and out of places , " she said , moments after one of her new aides had guided her into a 40-minute meeting with TIME editors and correspondents . The ferocity of a vice-presidential candidate 's schedule , she quickly learned , leaves hardly any time for leisurely schmoozing . " I never get to mill , " Ferraro complained , smiling . " Only a week , and I 'm already out of touch . " <P> She was unfortunately out of sight for most of the hundreds who gathered for her first open-to-the-public appearance : Ferraro and Mondale , speaking from the deeply sunken Halladie Plaza , could be seen only by people standing at the front of the crowd above . Nevertheless , the cheers were louder and longer during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> When she stepped onstage Monday afternoon for a women 's political fund raiser , and the next morning at a women 's caucus , she was received like a feminist superheroine , history incarnate . At the morning caucus session of 2,000 female delegates and alternates , she kept her remarks brief and understated , as she did in all of her joint appearances with Mondale . Yet , in five minutes the audience whooped and applauded ten times and chanted , " Gerry , Gerry , Gerry . " Said she : " I need you . We all need each other . " By remarkable coincidence , Ferraro 's birthday-Aug. 26-is the date when women got the vote in 1920 , and is now celebrated as Women 's Equality Day .
