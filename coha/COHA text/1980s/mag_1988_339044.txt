At first Yasser Arafat refused to speak with journalists . When he finally granted an interview to the Saudi Arabian newspaper Asharq al Awsat , a bile of irritation coated his words . He was never consulted before King Hussein cut Jordan 's links with the West Bank last month , he complained . Yet that move dumped into his lap the responsibility for administering the occupied territory and for trying to recover it from Israel . <P> But if Arafat was initially stunned , the Middle East was abuzz last week with speculation that Hussein 's shove may finally push the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization into doing the unthinkable : recognizing Israel 's right to exist . Such a gesture , which would amount to an unprecedented P.L.O . peace proposal , has long been demanded by the U.S. and Israel before they would even contemplate talking with the P.L.O . <P> Deep skepticism is in order . The P.L.O . ' s 24-year history is replete with rumors of imminent peace overtures soon followed by truculent denials . Arafat is infamous for his ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , hard-liners within his fractious organization who consider all of Israel to be Palestinian land have angrily denounced talk of recognizing Israel as treason . <P> What is different now is that the P.L.O . has never before been under such pressure to seize the initiative . Hussein 's decision and the growing impatience of leaders of the eight-month-old uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to transform their revolt into political gains may finally force Arafat to compromise . Says Edward Said , a prominent Palestinian American who is a professor at Columbia University : " The P.L.O . realizes that this is a historical opportunity that should not be muffed . " <P> Meeting in Baghdad last week , the 15-member P.L.O . executive committee approved a proposal establishing a provisional government in the occupied territories as a step toward creating an independent Palestinian state . At the same time , a ten-member P.L.O . working group is forging a new political program that , among other things , would endorse U.N . Resolution 181 . Known as the Partition Plan and adopted in 1947 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be divided into two states , one Jewish , one Arab . By accepting the resolution , albeit 41 years after it was initially offered , the P.L.O . for the first time would be acknowledging Israel 's legal right to statehood . As one of the P.L.O . ' s draft proposals puts it , " The Palestinian people do not desire the annihilation of the state of Israel . Rather , they wish to live peacefully as its neighbor . " <P> A P.L.O . delegation traveled to Egypt last week and won President Hosni Mubarak 's support for a plan to " offer through a provisional government a political program that would be internationally acceptable , " a P.L.O . official said . Speaking to the Paris weekly Journal du Dimanche , Arafat 's second in command , Salah Khalaf , said the new agenda " would be completely different " from the 1968 National Charter calling for " armed struggle " to destroy Israel . <P> Arafat plans to submit the proposals for approval to the Palestine National Council , the P.L.O . ' s 451-member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September . Later he hopes to launch a major diplomatic offensive , speaking to the European Parliament in Strasbourg and , if it can be arranged , to the U.N .
