She seems small and vulnerable against the bleak backdrop of high-rise buildings of the Robert Taylor Homes , where 20 , 000 residents , virtually all black , live in concentrated poverty. // Her first child is expected in February . The unmarried teen-ager , who lives in the project with her mother and some of her nine sisters and brothers , admits she is worried about feeding and caring for an infant . But she is comforted now , knowing that her child , even before birth , is eligible for an innovative program of benefits and services for all babies born next year in 6 of the 28 Taylor houses . About 125 to 150 children are expected to qualify . Most will be born to unwed teen-agers. // The program will supply intensive and comprehensive support to the children from birth to the age of 5 so they can enter kindergarten together at nearby Beethoven Elementary School in 1993 prepared to succeed. // The program , known informally as the Beethoven Project , will see to it that expectant mothers receive prenatal care so their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . The project will also try to overcome problems with poor nurturing , teaching the mothers the skills of mothering as well as providing counseling and encouragement to help them stay in school and to get job training. // Some of that support will come from community members , including a Community Advisory Council that is already involved in helping to shape the program . There is also an older group of welfare mothers who are working to identify women eligible for the project . Later they will visit the homes of the first-time mothers to provide advice and friendship. // Gina Barclay McLaughlin , an educational psychologist who is director of the Beethoven Project , said she and her staff were confident that the program ' s offer of care and other benefits would not encourage a surge of new pregnancies. // " We already know when people feel good about themselves they make responsible decisions , " she said. // Judith Steinhagen , principal of DuSable High School , the school attended by most of the teen-agers in the Taylor Homes , at least until many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Beethoven Project is a Marshall Plan for preschoolers. " // The undertaking , financed by an unusual mix of government and private financing , is largely the inspiration of Irving B. Harris , a Chicago businessman who has poured $20 million into other philanthropic projects , mainly efforts to help children and prevent teen-age pregnancies and haphazard child rearing . Beethoven ' s home visitors casually refer to " Irving Harris babies . " Another group of 100 to 150 babies born in the same buildings will be added in 1988 and again in 1989. // Mr. Harris has committed a total of $600 , 000 for the next three years , matching a $600 , 000 grant from the Federal Department of Health and Human Services . State and city agencies have provided other help . Mr. Harris has also made a commitment to take care of costs in the program ' s fourth and fifth years . <> <> Agencies Backing Project // The Beethoven Project is underpinned by a range of social agencies that Mr. Harris established over the years , whose economic contributions to the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal ties to prominent child development specialists and to government officials , one of them Gregory L. Coler , director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid. // Mr. Coler , who is 42 , and Mr. Harris , who is 76 , frequently talk about the partnership of " the older lion of industry who hooked up with the young bureaucrat . " But underlying the jest is a shared commitment to save children from the ravages of poverty , which Mr. Coler says means " not waiting until an arm is broken or a kid scalded . " <> <> Earlier Work on Family Problems // Five years ago , when Mr. Coler was head of Illinois ' Department of Children and Family Services , and Mr. Harris chairman of the Pittway Corporation , they jointly created the Ounce of Prevention Fund to work on family problems that can lead to child abuse and neglect . The fund operates the Beethoven Project with help from the Chicago Urban League. // " Too many social services deal with the toe , the elbow or the ear , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with kids not yet born and provides services for mothers greatly at risk and because it works within the community using community people . If the experiment works , it should be no problem taking the results and mainlining them into the policy engine of the state . " , Mr. Harris chooses his words carefully in assessing the program , whose evolution is being watched by officials in other cities , including Mayor Donald Fraser of Minneapolis. // " There isn ' t anything new in Beethoven in terms of kinds of services families will receive , " Mr. Harris says . " What is new is providing comprehensive care to such a large group over a five-year period . " The justification is obvious , he adds. // " Forty-five percent of the children born each year in Chicago grow up at high risk of being functionally illiterate at age 18 , physically sub par , with no job skills and doomed to poverty , " Mr. Harris said . " Eventually they will get picked up in the welfare system or criminal justice system or some other system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of $10 , 000 a year . " <> <> Mayor Hails the Project // Chicago ' s Mayor , Harold Washington , calls the program a " great idea - an effort to avoid the social , psychological and physiological disfunction that prevails in depressed areas. " // Other programs in Chicago have tackled the developmental needs of children raised in poverty , says Commissioner Judith Walker of the Department of Human Services , pointing out that the city has 11 , 500 youngsters aged 3 to 5 enrolled in Head Start. // " But we need this program to get back on peoples ' minds the issue of producing healthy individuals and functioning citizens , " she said . " And they don ' t come out of cabbage patches : they need to be nurtured. " // Wynette Frazier , a member of the Community Advisory Council who directs a consortium of 23 social service agencies , acknowledges having early doubts about the venture. // " The black community has been studied to death , " she said , " and the result of spending half a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that has not prevented teen-age pregnancy or low birth weight babies or lifted the self-esteem of teen-agers who would rather stay in bed than get on with their lives . Here ' s a program that has been brought to the heart of the community . It creates some jobs . It allows the community council to help give directions and so , of course , people embraced it . " <> <> Some Operations Under Way // Beethoven ' s organizers are still putting in place the pieces of their program , but some operations are under way. // Recently the Chicago Housing Authority signed an agreement to provide an entire vacant floor of a Robert Taylor building to be used as a center where children and their mothers can drop in for advice and obtain health and day care services. // The facility will be the hub of the Center for Successful Child Development , as the Beethoven Project is formally named. // But first it will require renovations costing $100 , 000. // The first time Mrs. McLaughlin , the project ' s director , saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use crowbars to pry open the door . There were holes in the cinder-block walls , piles of refuse on the floors and the stench of urine. // " Dream with me , " she told her small staff . " I see painted walls , plants , classrooms where we will teach nutrition , and a library . I want this to be a living space for all generations , grandparents , mothers and children . We ' ll involve the fathers too or die trying . " <> <> An Enthusiastic Staff // At times the enthusiasm of the staff members is heady . " We want to create a place that will not be an institution but more like a home , " said Cecilia Bowie , a child development specialist who is associate director of the Beethoven Project. // " We ' ll have coffee perking all the time , " said Haroldine Bourelly , the Urban League ' s director of community liaison . The center is modeled on another Harris-supported venture called Family Focus , which operates seven such centers to serve poor families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key element , has met four times . Council members , especially those living in the neighborhood , will assess the program and informally supply feedback on its performance to the staff. // Meanwhile , Beethoven ' s staff organizers have been focusing on training six residents of the Taylor houses , all of them welfare recipients , who will make home visits to the apartments where the young mothers live , help them prepare for their babies and later watch the progress of the infants . For this , they will earn $9 , 500 a year . <> <> Training Also Under Way // Cheryl Stampley , a nurse and Beethoven ' s social services director , is teaching the six to recognize symptoms of ill health and to report their findings to the project ' s administrators . Writing reports is the hardest lesson , she says . Not only the babies but also entire families will reap benefits ; if older children are found to need counseling or tutoring , they will get it. // The six are also canvassing the community for women who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering as an inducement a $10 gift certificate to a fast-food chain to those who respond . The detailed information will provide a valuable data base for researchers , including Dr. Sidney Hans , a clinical researcher at the University of Chicago who will evaluate the program. // Because the Taylor Homes have been a site of recurrent muggings , the six are warned to make their rounds in pairs . Some climb the stairs rather than use the elevators , where women have been attacked . They are also told not to venture into inner rooms when in strange apartments and not to let furniture block their access to the door in case they have to leave quickly. // Sheila Morris , one of the six home visitors , lives with her mother , three sons , a stepdaughter and the children ' s unemployed father . The two-bedroom apartment is small and crowded but efforts have been made to make the living room homelike , with slipcovered furniture , pictures and plants. // Miss Morris , who is 29 and the youngest of 12 children , has lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her small stepdaughter , she talks of wanting her own place , saying , " I laid down to have my children ; I want to raise them myself . " <> <> Low-Income Development // The Taylor Homes were opened in 1960 , a compound of apartment buildings isolated from Chicago by a bordering expressway . Even then , many regarded them as an effort to segregate the poor black community , according to Barbara Bowman , a specialist in educating minority children at the Erikson Institute , another Harris-supported organization . The 16-story structures built for low-income tenants were named for her late father , a civic-minded leader of the Chicago Housing Authority , but she says he would have abhorred the housing development. // Within a few years , the high-rise buildings deteriorated , becoming what James W. Compton , the Urban League ' s president , calls a " breeding ground of despair . " Still , tenants say , they get " good heat " and there is a long waiting list for apartments. // In this environment , organizers of the Beethoven Project acknowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on involvement of residents. // Although she refers to the project lightly as " Super-Ounce , " Dr. Judith Musick , executive director of the Ounce of Prevention Fund , says she is troubled that there will be inadequate time to prepare the six home visitors adequately . " They will have to hit the ground running , " she said. // " You go into the project , knock on a door and if the mother is not interested , you come away and figure out how to induce her to cooperate , " said Dr. Musick . " Maybe you suggest an evening of cosmetic demonstrations , a pizza night or a talk about their legal rights to welfare or medical care . " Even so , Mrs. Bowman predicts they will not reach the families with the worst problems. // One of those whose life has already been changed is Victoria Barton , among the first to sign up for the program , who says , " I ' m happy I live here. " // " I ' m not worried now because people will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t know about nutrition so I have a healthy baby , " she said . She talks animatedly about going back to DuSable High School and then finding a good job. // " And we ' ll help you do all of that , " promised Mrs. McLaughlin. //
