Restaurant Critic Mimi Sheraton is feared and followed <P> Finally someone hit back . When Mimi Sheraton , restaurant critic of the New York Times and the most influential commentator on dining out in America , was spotted at a table in a new Manhattan spot , the owner threw her out . Fumed Michael O'Keeffe , proprietor of the Water Club : " The public loves something , then a critic comes along and says it 's not good . " O'Keeffe 's stand was brave but futile . Sheraton took to her Friday column last week and described the encounter in her usual remorseless detail , ending with some speculation on the rights of an orderly person who is ejected from a public restaurant . The rest of the column was devoted to a classic example of what O'Keeffe so greatly fears : a 750-word , clinical rundown on a Chinese restaurant , including the likeliest days to get a decent meal and a wrist-slap for the rest rooms . <P> To anyone paying New York restaurant bills , such advice is invaluable , and Sheraton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . She eats out 40 times or more a month . She goes to extreme lengths not to be identified , in the belief that anonymity will help her make sure that she receives the same treatment as any other patron . After six years on the bistro beat , she finds anonymity hard to come by . Sheraton is a familiar face at all the bigger and more fashionable eating places in Manhattan ; the attention lavished on her at such establishments supports her case for camouflage . She never makes reservations in her own name ; she often pays the bill with a credit card issued to a pseudonym , and varies her disguises . " I 've thought seriously , " she says , " of dressing as a nun or a Hasidic rabbi , or wearing a suit of armor . " <P> Sheraton , 56 , is a perfectionist with an exhaustive knowledge of foodstuffs and their preparation , and rigid , consistent standards .

Awkwardly titled Mimi Sheraton 's The New York Times Guide to New York Restaurants , the $9.95 paperback is as diverse as the city , ranging from minuscule Chinatown dim-sum joints to the midtown cathedrals of continental cuisine . <P> The publication was greeted glumly at some highly regarded restaurants that have been downgraded by the Times 's critic . The most prestigious victim was La Caravelle , a formerly four-star ( extraordinary ) eminence reduced to two stars ( very good ) . On the other hand , one of only four recipients of a four-star award was The Coach House , a venerable Greenwich Village establishment that many other critics consider unimpressive . ( The other top-rated spots : La Grenouille , Lutce , Vienna ' 79 . ) <P> Before publishing her judgment , Sheraton pays an average of four to six visits to a restaurant , but as many as twelve on occasion . The Times picks up between $67,000 and $73,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the food , " the primary and overwhelming factor . " Service counts too ; the inept captain and the rude waiter are always noted .
