But out on the street , dressed in cashmere coats and $150 shoes , he made his mark as the self-styled general of an army of muggers . They called him " Peewee " because he was so short , but by the time Harold Brown turned 13 he had committed murder. // " School wasn ' t my thing , " said Mr. Brown , who is now 20 years old and has been imprisoned since the age of 15 . There were many at school who tried to help Peewee . He saw psychologists , was assigned to dedicated teachers and eventually was sent to a special public school . But his violence only increased . He said it was not uncommon for him to stab someone who had inadvertently hurt his feelings or to negotiate the price of a sandwich with one of his numerous guns. // In the very beginning , there was a tug of war between the world of school and that of the streets , but anyone who ever taught Peewee knew which side would win. // " We knew when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was nothing we could do to help him , " said Coy Cox , the principal of Public School 369 , the special school to which Peewee was sent in the sixth grade. // An examination of Peewee ' s life exposes the paradoxes , frustrations and fear that confront teachers , principals and other school officials who come up against juvenile crime in the city ' s schools . But it also reflects the school system ' s isolation , leaving wayward youngsters to drift from jail back to school or from a mental health clinic to family court with no continuity or understanding. // It reflects , too , a broader breakdown in the city ' s system of dealing with juveniles in trouble . And it shows not only that youngsters like Peewee can commit countless crimes without fear of imprisonment , but also that they are left with the impression that such behavior is condoned. // Despite years of frustration with crimes by the young , only now has the city begun to form a coalition of the disparate city agencies involved in dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is neither a citywide strategy nor a system for exchanging information. // School is a child ' s first exposure to public authority and , like the 66 , 500 youngsters in New York City under the age of 17 who skip classes on any given day , Peewee was a truant . So were the two other young criminals who will be the focus of subsequent articles in this series . Their lives describe the evolution of young delinquent behavior and how the criminal justice system contributes to it . <> <> ' Now It ' s a Police Problem ' // " My responsibility is to reduce crime in the schools , " said Angelo Aponte , director of the Board of Education ' s Office of School Safety . " We ' ve displaced crime from the schools to the streets . Now it ' s a police problem . There isn ' t a whole lot the educational system can do with these kids , kids with twisted behavior problems , kids who for the rest of their lives need supervision. " // Some might say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is an example of how the system failed . Harold ( Peewee ) Brown was born on Sept. 24 , 1961 , the son of an unemployed alcoholic who left his wife when Peewee was 7 months old and who died when the boy was 14 . Peewee ' s mother , Louise , an articulate woman with a high school education , always worked to support herself and her three sons . She had to be at her job by 8 A.M. , so she left them alone at home at 7 A.M. and did not return until 5 P.M. Often , she conceded , she did not know what they were doing while she was gone. // " I told them at school , ' When he gets bad , get your stick , ' " Mrs. Brown recalled . " I ' d tell them , ' You ' re the kid ' s mother and father when you ' re in school . I can ' t be there . Whomp his behind. ' " // But , she said , the schools could not control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with teachers , psychologists and others that her son should be taken away from her and that she needed help . <> <> A Murderer at 13 // Over a four-year period , from the age of 11 to 15 , Peewee was arrested 15 times on charges ranging from sodomy to assault , although the school system - for reasons of confidentiality - was never informed. // He now admits that those arrests were for only a small number of his crimes . For example , he said , when he was 13 he shot and killed a man on a deserted street corner in Brooklyn , but was never caught . He added that he seriously wounded at least six others and committed countless other robberies. // But even those few times he was caught , Peewee went free . Each time he was arrested , Family Court routinely dismissed the charge or put him on probation , releasing him back into his mother ' s custody in an absurd cycle of crime , capture and release that continued until , at the age of 15 , Peewee shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to court and school records , Peewee had been arrested for having taken a loaded revolver to school . Because Family Court records are sealed , it is impossible to know the court ' s rationale in disposing of the gun case or any of the others. // " All they would do is send him back , " said Mrs. Brown , a 41-year-old frame-maker who to this day remains confused by the leniency with which her son was repeatedly treated . " They didn ' t punish him . I told them : ' He keeps getting into trouble . There should be somewhere he can go . ' All they did was send him back to me. " // Although both of his brothers - Howard , now 21 , and Anthony , 16 - had difficulties as well in their younger years , neither has ever been in jail . Howard is currently attending college to become a medical assistant . Anthony is a student at Thomas Jefferson High School. // The Gathering Storm // To his mother , Peewee was a child out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " boss of everything . " To his teachers , he was a charming and engaging " psychopath " who , despite their efforts , was doomed to a life of violent crime. // Peewee would agree with them all . " I had to do what I had to do , " he said simply during a recent interview in jail . " They all told me . But I didn ' t want to listen. " // In this interview , Peewee enumerated many of his crimes , although in some cases it was impossible to verify his account independently . Wherever possible the recollections were confirmed by former teachers , his family , the police , court documents or school records. // Peewee said that his earliest memories were of cutting class , of stealing fruit from the local vegetable stand and of the violence of his neighborhood . For example , he said , there was the day he was playing ball downstairs in the courtyard when he heard a commotion from the 12th floor - an argument that ended with an infant ' s being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps from where he was standing. // Then there was the afternoon his best friend was crushed to death in an elevator shaft during a game of racing up and down floors . Always , Peewee said , there were the stabbings , the fist fights , the exciting street talk of plunder . <> <> Compensated for His Height // From the beginning , on the streets of Fort Greene and in the housing project where he grew up , it was important for Peewee - who was always short for his age and today stands 5 feet 5 inches tall - to be tough and to become a leader. // Quick with his fists and afraid of nothing , he made up for what he lacked in height with bravado . " I couldn ' t allow them to talk about me : ' Shorty , get out of here , look at your shoes , look at your pants , look at your coat , ' " Peewee recalled. // By the age of 7 , he said , and several of his former teachers confirmed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketbooks out of old women ' s hands - showing off to all his friends , luring them to stay out of school and giving them lessons on how to steal. // " I ' d say , " Peewee recalled , " ' Let ' s not go to school today . ' We just go downtown . And we are hustling . Like that . Hustling . Get money . Go home . You know . Go buy a coat . Ain ' t in school the next day . Hustling . We ' re on our way back out again. " // School records indicate that Peewee ' s problems began in school almost as soon as he did . In kindergarten , he was absent the equivalent of nearly three months - a pattern of truancy that was to continue throughout the duration of his education. // When informed of her son ' s absences , Mrs. Brown said , she " grounded " Peewee . When that did not work , she said , she gave him a beating . At one point , Mrs. Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each day from school signed by his teacher saying he was in class . Peewee says he did that - but used the same note . <> <> A Note From the Principal // Harry Lutzer , Peewee ' s principal at P.S. 11 when the boy was 7 and in the first grade , wrote the following note : " Harold appears to possess fairly normal intelligence , yet his volatile behavior , his tendency to fight with other children , his involvement in petty thievery , his involvement in vandalism about the building all seem to militate against his normal intellectual development. " // " Harold is extremely antisocial and can not work cooperatively with a group , " wrote Howard Newshan , a guidance counselor who examined Peewee the following year after his family moved to the public housing project in the Fort Greene section and he was enrolled at P.S. 67. // Peewee was now in the second grade , but he was still unable to distinguish between the letters of the alphabet . He terrorized his classmates , forcing them to strip in the halls , surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaulted one teacher and then was transferred to another , but eventually he physically harassed that teacher as well . Finally , he was placed in the class of a teacher who was able to control him . <> <> ' He Was Very Competitive ' // She is still at P.S. 67 and remembers Peewee well , but out of fear she asked that her name not be used . It was she who noticed for the first time that one reason Peewee was having so much trouble in class was that he needed glasses. // " He was very competitive , " she recalled , sitting in the same spare principal ' s office where Peewee had been summoned countless times and where , both Peewee and his former principal recalled , he once threatened this principal with murder . " But he couldn ' t read. " // In the third grade , Peewee was placed in a special class with only seven other pupils and three teachers , including the same woman who was able to control him . Peewee ' s truancy , according to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he liked this teacher . He saw a psychologist weekly and , finally , after months of delay , Peewee ' s mother got him glasses . Still , the attacks on classmates continued and still Peewee could not read - in large part because he refused to wear the glasses . He wandered uncontrollably through the halls , kicking in classroom doors , terrorizing all who crossed his path. // Peewee Drafts an Army // In the sixth grade , Peewee ' s principal , who out of fear asked not to be identified , recommmended after numerous suspensions , which Peewee welcomed , that the boy be transferred to P.S. 369 , a school that specializes in dealing with youngsters with behavior difficulties . It is one of 20 such schools throughout the city. // The principal described Peewee at the time in a school report as a " bully " who was " positively charming " in a one-to-one relationship but " hostile " and " aggressive " in a crowd . He " seems to be searching to find a niche , " he said. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that out on the streets he had long since found that niche , turning an obsession with self-respect , a natural ability to lead and a wanton disregard for life into a highly efficient enterprise of crime. // It began with shoplifting and mugging on his own - in the neighborhood and then wherever the subways took him , with victims picked at random . But it did not take long for him to translate these skills into the quick rewards of management. // He began to threaten young boys in his housing project with revenge if they did not steal for him . In this way , he slowly pieced together his own personal army of muggers , who fanned out into other Brooklyn neighborhoods and onto the streets of Manhattan and Queens - anywhere they could find expensive clothing , jewelry and money . <> <> Rewards for His ' Army ' // At one point , Peewee said , he had more than a dozen youngsters working for him , whom he regularly rewarded by throwing pizza parties , treating them to movies and otherwise impressing them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peewee said , he could earn as much as $500 . He was only 14. // Peewee ' s trademarks became three-piece velveteen suits , designer sunglasses and a flashy collection of hats so that he " dressed more fashionable , more expensive " than anyone else . Even today he speaks with great delight about the " tailor-made " black suit , his multicolored collection of hats , a $500 " custom-made " gold medallion. // He took his greatest pride , however , in what became a kind of symbol of his combined fashion acumen and newly acquired power : a collection of loaded pistols that matched his shirts. // " Like I have on brown today so I would take one that had a brown handle , " Peewee explained . On this particular day in jail , he was wearing a brown turtleneck. // Mrs. Brown said in an interview that she had no idea of the extent of her son ' s crimes . She said that she was under the impression his extensive wardrobe had been borrowed from friends . The first time she learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when the police arrived at her door one day to say that Peewee was under arrest . The arrests then happened often - and each time , she said , the authorities just sent him home . <> <> Court Was a ' Joke ' // Peewee was never afraid about going to court . In his mind , going to court was " a joke " - a comic charade of men in long black robes who made empty threats and always let him go . " They were nothing to me , " Peewee said , aping their warnings , " ' You better . You better . I ' m telling you , you better. ' " // Once , however , Peewee recalled that as he sat in court waiting for his case to be called , his ears perked up . " Parties in Harold Brown , " the court officer cried out . He thought someone was going to give him a party. // " Every time I got caught I would say : ' I swear I ' ll never do it no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Peewee said . " Soon as they do , I ' m out there doing it again. " // If he had disregard for the police , judges and the court system , he neverthless developed his own notions of justice - a code he expected others to respect. // He said he once beat a young girl into a coma because she called him a name . And he said he shot a man , who he later learned had died , because he felt the man had cheated him in a street game . He said he could become offended simply by the way someone was looking in his direction. // " I felt if you try to hurt me , I ' m definitely going to hurt you , " Peewee explained . " I would definitely get you back . " <> <> A Ruckus in a Deli // It was this kind of reasoning that Peewee used , for example , one afternoon when he walked into a delicatessen and was annoyed with the price of a sandwich . He took out his gun. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 cents for a big one , " Peewee explained . " And this time the hero got smaller and the money got larger. " // Peewee recalled that when he took out the gun , everyone in the store " started freaking out , the women screaming . " " Some of the men were ducking and hollering , " he said . " And the person I had the beef with was begging straight out not to kill him. " // He said the counter attendant pleaded with him not to shoot because he had a wife and children . The remark , Peewee said , made him laugh . But he did not shoot the man because he gave him the sandwich. // If he saw someone on the street wearing an item of clothing or jewelry he wanted , Peewee would take it by force . He said he felt entitled to take what he wanted because his victim did not " deserve " it . He usually felt that way about men who were older and taller than himself , he said , and their resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Justified ' // Peewee denies that he was involved in an armed robbery - as the police charged - that day when he was 15 and he and a friend stormed into a grocery on Myrtle Avenue and shot and killed the grocer . To Peewee , the murder was " justified . " He explained that he had killed the grocer because he had shown a lack of regard for one of Peewee ' s girlfriends. // " Anything I did was justified so far as I was concerned , " Peewee added . " I don ' t feel guilt because it ' s done and over with . " The school system was never officially informed that Peewee pleaded guilty to murder . The last records they have are two notes , one sent some months after the crime saying he had been sent to Kings County Hospital for psychiatric observation and a second one still later requesting that his records be sent to jail . They also never learned that Peewee is a father - he became one at the age of 14 - and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although Peewee himself does not know where. // A Cry for Coordination // Schools Chancellor Frank J. Macchiarola did not dispute the charge that the school system was isolated , nor did he deny the link between truancy and delinquency . And he said that he would like to see the school system become a focal point around which these problems could be resolved. // But he said he did not believe that was possible without a citywide strategy for addressing the problem of juvenile crime on both a public and private level. // " There ' s a need for us to coordinate with agencies reaching into the home , " said Mr. Macchiarola . " I have got the kids . Why aren ' t people coming to me ? " // Private and public agencies , in turn , place the blame on the schools . They say the problem is that there is no systemwide approach and that agency workers are often made to feel unwelcome inside the schools. // When they come to offer their services , some social service agency officials charge , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district superintendent ' s office , back to the central Board of Education. // " The school system is totally isolated from community life , " said Richard Murphy , executive director of Rheedlen , a nonprofit agency specializing in truancy that works within the schools. // Meanwhile , on any given day the Board of Education estimates that there are 66 , 500 youngsters under the age of 17 truant from school - the size of some small cities . This is only a small fraction of the number of youngsters over that age who have dropped out of the school system entirely . <> <> Mother Still Uncertain // " Truancy is like bleeding , " said Mr. Cox , the principal of P.S. 369 , where Peewee ' s truancy persisted . " It indicates something else . When our kids are truant , we know something ' s wrong. " // Peewee ' s mother is still not certain what actually happened that cold afternoon in the grocery on Myrtle Avenue - whether her son was involved in an armed robbery or , indeed , whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing in her living room , she said her son ' s release from jail would be the " happiest day of my life . " She believes that he has learned his lesson and is ready to come home. // In exchange for his cooperation with the prosecutors , Peewee was allowed to admit his involvement in the killing at the age of 15 , and plead guilty to a charge that , if he were an adult , would be considered felony murder . He was sentenced to three years in jail in 1977 , a year before the state ' s new juvenile offender law took effect , establishing stiffer sentences for serious crimes. // The probation office at the time described Peewee as needing a " strong structural environment . . . to obviate an aggressiveness that he can not handle at this time . " Eleven months later , the same office found Peewee ' s institutional adjustment " excellent . " It said that he " respects rules and regulations , accepts authority , has shown considerable growth " and recommended that he be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // While still serving out his sentence for murder , Peewee was given a weekend pass to go home . Several hours later , he and a friend stormed into a Brooklyn apartment with a gun , forced the man inside to engage in sodomy and stole his leather coat. // It is for this robbery that Peewee is currently serving a six-year sentence at the Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville , N.Y. He has been spending his time there diligently disciplining his body , doing hundreds of sit-ups , lifting weights and limiting his diet in preparation for a professional career in boxing . If that does not work , he believes he will find a job in construction or - because in jail he finally did learn how to read - as a video technician. // Still , he admits , he worries . Sometimes , he says , he lies awake at night in his cell staring at the ceiling , wondering whether his sleek physique will be enough , whether he will miss his fancy clothes and whether he will be able to survive on the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is that he wants to go home . He comes before the Parole Board in July for possible release in September. <> <>  --   --  // Next : The role of the Family Court. // This article is part of a continuing inquiry into crime in New York : its impact on ways of life throughout the city and its suburbs , and its handling by the police , prosecutors and courts. //
