The two Germanys nurture ties <P> Ingrid Berg was no ordinary East German , and she did not flee the country like one . With her husband , mother-in-law and two children , 3 and 7 , Berg drove the family Volvo to Czechoslovakia , the only foreign country that East Germans can visit without an exit permit . In Prague they headed for the West German embassy , claimed refuge and demanded asylum in the Federal Republic . Then Berg revealed her identity : she was , she said , the niece of East German Premier Willi Stoph , the second most important man in the Communist hierarchy . <P> The East German government quickly declared that Stoph " had nothing to do with the actions " of the Berg family . Western publicity concerning the defection , said the official East German press agency , was an attempt to poison relations between the two Germanys . Officials in Bonn were equally disturbed by the attention the West German press gave the Berg incident . In an effort to avoid further embarrassing the East Germans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter . After spending six days in the Prague embassy , the Berg family returned late last week to East Germany . It was generally understood that they had received guarantees of an exemption from prosecution and of eventual permission to leave for the West . <P> As the Berg case illustrates , the nurturing of ties between the two Germanys has become an increasingly important preoccupation on both sides of the border at a time when relations between Washington and Moscow have worsened . East Germany has sharply hiked the number of exit permits , to about 3,000 monthly , that it allows to citizens who desire to move to the West .

One sign of such interest : for the past five months a book titled Where Germany Lies , written by Gnter Gaus , 53 , who served from 1974 to 1981 as West Germany 's first diplomatic representative to East Germany , has been on the West German bestseller list . The attraction of Gaus ' memoir seems to be its openly nostalgic quest for a lost sense of German national identity within the economically less advanced East . " People in the East kept what West Germans surrendered , " Gaus says . " The power to persevere grew over there , while it evaporated quickly here . " Confronted with the relative backwardness of smalltown East German life , Gaus muses , " How much more German . "
