For white employers , here in this retirement community on Natal ' s Indian Ocean coast or anywhere else in South Africa , the local labor bureau is a kind of commodity exchange , run strictly on the basis of supply and demand . Given the pressure of unemployment in the rural black " homelands , " the advantage is usually with prospective employers who can offer work through the labor bureau of any duration , for any wage. // // A Source of Employment // For the milling crowds of blacks who wait in the open enclosures that are normally found at the rear of these government offices , the labor bureau is not just a source of employment but the only place they are legally entitled to look for work , with the exception of the private recruiting organizations that are licensed by the authorities to hire labor for the mines and the large sugar estates. // The only blacks with any exemption from the requirement that they find work in white areas through the state system are those who have been officially certified as urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to 20 percent of the heavily regulated black work force. // In practice , the new opportunities for training and advancement that are suddenly opening to blacks in South African industry under what gets hailed here as a " new labor dispensation " are reserved mainly for this group , which can thus be described as comparatively privileged , even though its members - knowing how underprivileged they still are in comparison with whites - would be unlikely to put it that way. // The rest , according to regulations that are now enforced with increasing stringency , can only get to the urban areas after it has been demonstrated that there are no takers among urban blacks for the jobs being offered them . Normally this means that they can aspire to only the roughest , most menial work . <> <> Blacks Sent Back to Homelands // The labor bureaus thus function as one track of a two-way system , the other track being the one that runs through the courts administered by a bureaucratic behemoth called the Ministry of Cooperation and Development . These exist to send blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120 , 000 a year - when they are found to have entered what are termed the " prescribed " areas on their own. // Increasingly , despite the emphasis South African officials place on their devotion to free-market principles , a black contract laborer who tries to improve his status by switching jobs in the urban areas runs the risk of falling back into the employment limbo in the homelands. // He can look for a new job only by registering again as a workseeker at the labor bureau , which will not consider the application until his previous employer has returned an offical form explaining why he no longer holds the job for which he was originally registered. // " **27;0;TOOLONG " is the choice presented on the form . If it turns out that he " deserted " - that is , left voluntarily - he is in danger of being " endorsed out " of the white area. // That is what happened to Joseph Mavhunda , an enterprising hostel dweller from a homeland called Venda who now stays in a black township called Wattville , east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhance his wages by about 20 cents an hour by moving from one factory owned by Barlow Rand , a major South African industrial group , to another owned by the same group . <> <> Domestic Passport Is Stamped // But his reference book - the domestic passport that all blacks are supposed to carry - was then stamped with the dreaded " 72 hour " order , giving him that much time to remove himself from the urban area. // Ultimately , Mr. Mavhunda , who has worked in an industrial center called Benoni for 26 years , was able to arrange a valid contract for himself through the labor bureau. // But the old " 72 hour " stamp is still in his reference book to show officials that he once tried to buck the system , and he still has trouble every year , he says , when he returns to Venda to renew his contract. // A recent study found that a migrant from a homeland called Lebowa who went to Johannesburg illegally would improve his earnings by 255 percent if he worked for nine months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for three months and spent nine in jail , he would still be 85 percent better off , the study found . <> <> Urban and Rural Economies // The dualism between a sophisticated urban economy and an underdeveloped rural economy is found throughout the world , of course , being a hallmark of countries as diverse as Nigeria , India and Brazil . China and the Soviet Union regulate the movement of population in what might be termed a form of " influx control . " What is distinctive about South Africa is the effort to build political barriers along the fault lines of economic and social dualism , and to do so on a strictly racial basis , so that blacks are told that their only political future lies in the least developed rural areas , their " homelands. " // The shape of the labor system is determined exclusively by whites . No blacks hold policy-making roles in the Ministry of Cooperation and Development . No blacks vote for the Parliament that enacts the laws it enforces. // The success of the Government ' s efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the country can be judged from a statistic presented by Charles Simkins , a University of Cape Town economist who has made the most careful analysis of demographic and employment trends : In 1960 , when the black population of South Africa was 12. 5 million , only 40 percent of all blacks were residents of the homelands . Twenty years later , after an overall rise in the black population of nine million , the proportion in the homelands was 54 percent . <> <> A Debilitating Cycle // Greater pressure on land means smaller plots . Smaller plots mean less crop rotation . Less crop rotation means exhausted soil . In this debilitating cycle it is not uncommon for yields to decline to a point at which small cultivators choose to eat seed rather than plant it. // In the Zulu homeland of KwaZulu , which is spotted in tiny fragments across the province of Natal , the value of migrant remittances from the white areas now exceeds the value of domestic production by more than four to one. // Everything finally depends on how much money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that about 20 percent of cash earnings is typical . That is just about exactly what Alford Sebisi , a worker in a factory in Boksburg , east of Johannesburg , sends home to his wife and five children , who live near Nqutu , about 300 miles away , in a severely eroded section of KwaZulu. // Mr. Sebisi ' s take-home earnings are about $250 a month . In a good month , he says , he sends his family about $50 . Mr. Sebisi cooks meat for himself on a kerosene stove in his hostel nearly every night ; his family seldom has meat . <> <> Sending Home Their Earnings // Some migrant workers are more frugal or conscientious . They invest in better housing for their families and send home more money , but only in rare cases do they manage , by starting a small shop or transport business , to cut loose from the cycle of a migrant ' s life . Albert Zondi , who earns $65 a week driving a bus on a commuter service for blacks near Pietermaritzburg , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay envelope. // Recently he bought a nine-year-old Hillman at a used-car lot , so he could come home himself on occasional weekends to Makhabeleni , a hillside settlement in KwaZulu that is about 90 miles from where he stays . But then he had to pay the fuel and repair bills , which left him with the choice of limiting his visits or reducing the amount he sends for food . Asked if his standard of living was improving , he replied with a bitter laugh , " That ' s a funny. " // Yet is is commonplace in the homelands to encounter families who are incomparably worse off , for the simple reason that they receive little or no income from migrants . Not infrequently the result is hunger , the hopeless , chronic sort that results from sheer poverty. // Such hunger was evident in the Matyolo family , or rather the remnant of it that lives in Debenck , an obscure settlement in a homeland called Ciskei that was granted its nominal independence from South Africa this month . Ciskei is poor by third-world standards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not at all exceptional . <> <> Land Is Not Cultivated // Beauty Matyolo is the widow of a Port Elizabeth street cleaner . She lives with her elderly aunt , Evelyn . Also in the household are six children , two belonging to a daughter of Beauty Matyolo who died and four belonging to a grandson of the old woman who works in East London and only occasionally sends money. // The family has some land , but it has been fallow for three years because the women are too weak to cultivate it and too poor to hire a tractor . Their only regular income , they say , is the pension of slightly less than $70 that each received every other month from the South African Government before Ciskei was proclaimed independent. // The two adults and six children normaly eat only corn porridge . They add water to dilute it in the days before the pensions are due to be paid , when the money and corn meal run out . Some days they do not even have this gruel. // White South Africans are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African countries to the north . The discovery of it closer to home often drives them to dwell on what they take to be a racial conundrum : the question , as they pose it , of why blacks show so little initiative in the economic sphere . <> <> A Racial Stereotype // " The black is basically economically subsistence-oriented , " an Afrikaner official on the Port Natal Administration Board said . " Western man looks to the future . The black lives for the day. " // What this hoary racial stereotype leaves out is the role that Government policy has played in undermining black enterprise . The resettlement programs , which have involved flushing blacks considered surplus out of the white rural areas , provide the clearest illustration because they have systematically separated people from their livelihoods. // The results can be found in desolate encampments on remote hillsides in Ciskei , KwaZulu and an obscure homeland northeast of Pretoria known as KwaNdebele . In KwaZulu especially , the residents of such camps have often been forced to leave plots that they either owned themselves or rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " badly situated . " This is a legal term applied to black-owned land in areas that have become white by Government decree. // Of the 1. 2 million blacks who have been shifted to the homelands from white rural areas over the last two decades , nearly half a million have been forced out of these " black spots " where property was taken over simply because it was held by blacks . It is a Sisyphean labor for white officials - an additional 700 , 000 to one million blacks would have to be moved to bring this project near to completion in Ciskei and KwaZulu alone - yet it goes on . <> <> ' Badly Situated ' Communities // What that means , in practice , is that white officials show up in " badly situated " black communities and paint numbers on the houses - a first step in a survey of who has to be moved and what compensation is due for all that will be left behind. // Elsewhere , 50 or 100 miles away , other officials mark out little plots on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like little tin sentry boxes , are then erected on each plot . These too have numbers painted on them . As the date for what is known as the " removal " approaches , large metal boxes and tents are deposited on each plot to serve as temporary dwellings. // The authorities do not relish controversy these days ; removals are all supposed to be " voluntary . " Large communities that make it clear that physical force will have to be used to uproot them sometimes win a reprieve . Meanwhile , the authorities pick up eight families here ; bulldoze four houses there ; promise generous compensation to black landowners who evict their tenants , and otherwise press on with their efforts to realize the vision that the world knows as apartheid. // At a resettlement camp called Qudeni , a former tenant farmer named Ephriam Mdlulu mimed the experience of relocation by lifting a tea cup and casually , pointlessly setting it down across the table . " People are just lifted like cups , from wherever they are , " he said , " and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // While one arm of the Government deposits surplus labor in the homelands , another arm holds out incentives to industrialists to locate new plants nearby . The purpose is to create more jobs for " commuters " - homeland blacks whose residences are close enough to their jobs for them to make a round trip daily. // The town of Ladysmith , which is adjacent to a belt of resettlement sites , is to be one of the new " growth points . " But the commuting will not be short , because the white authorities have been busy for years moving blacks as far away from Ladysmith as possible. // Annie Khosa ' s family moved into a " black spot " called Matiwaneskop , about 20 miles from the textile factory where she works a 12-hour shift four days a week. // Her daily work experience says something about African initiative . To get to work on time , she must catch a bus at 4 : 15 A.M. , which means rising at 3 : 30 . It is 16 hours later , or 7 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Matiwaneskop . Thus it is dark when she leaves and dark when she returns . Her pay is $25 a week , of which $5. 25 goes to bus fare. // The problem is not that conditions are harsh but that there is a dearth of such jobs near Ladysmith . Besides , the white authorities are intent on moving the residents of Matiwaneskop even farther away. //
