In New York City , newsmen raced to keep up with the story of Archie , a dog beloved by Mayor Edward Koch that unexpectedly vanished for three days from the mayor 's official residence-and was welcomed back at a city-hall news conference . In Washington , the national press corps reported that a White House cricket , which had disrupted Nancy Reagan 's sleep , chirped no more . <P> The attention to such trivia was a sure sign that the nation was in the midst of that sultry vacationtime when people-and news events-wind down . Some editors claim that the modern news business resists the seasonal lassitude . But consider the Wichita Eagle-Beacon , which played on Page One a wire-service tale proclaiming that some 8,000 Americans are injured each year by toothpicks .

Tune in next August .                @ @ @ @ @
