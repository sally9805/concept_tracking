txt 1 // gratifications that limit the likelihood of other than consensus-discovery occurring , ( i.e. , the likelihood of serious conflict is minimized ) , which produces more gratifications and continued desires to please , and so forth . Furthermore , whatever consensus-discoveries do emerge tend to be tacitly understood as merely tentative or fluid in nature . There is as yet no explicit agreement between partners that a particular behavior pattern should be repeated , or even that it will be . Instead , the continuing exploration of possibly new and different activities and interests takes precedence over fixing the shape of any particular current behavior patterns , or even whether currently shared kinds of activities should or will be continued at all , in any form . In sum , both the behavior patterns themselves , as well as the character of the ongoing largely implicit decision-making dynamics , constitute largely ( though never exclusively ) extrinsic sorts of gratifications . Consequently a certain level of commitment between the partners is being sustained . Developing Out of Formation Phase While it may be logically possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is likely that most couples shift out of it after a certain period of time . Figure 5.1 suggests the varied transitions that can be made out of formation . DEVELOPING INTO MAINTENANCE/CHANGE Echoing our Chapter 3 references to Simmel and the Chicago process-oriented school of microsociology , as well as Kelley ( 1983a ) , Brickman ( 1987 : 145 ) argues : " commitments are completely rationalized or stable momentarily , and then new inconsistencies or contradictions emerge . There are no final stages , solutions , or end points . Thus the development of a commitment is seen here as a dialectical process , and a commitment itself is seen as a dynamic and ever-changing phenomenon . " The dialectics emerge both from the persons themselves and from their environment , including children , kin , peers , economic and cultural factors , and so forth . The thesis established during the formation phase is confronted by certain antitheses . Specifically , over time , certain silent agreements that were previously tacit or implicit tend to be made explicit by one or both partners . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of shared activities , and second , with the partners ' emerging history , investments // of time , energy , resources , and so on , can no longer be said to be merely limited . Given that the majority of their shared gratifications have existed at an extrinsic level , evaluations of their equitability and fairness become inevitable . Consequently , if the ongoing investments are proving to be rather costly ( owing either to the absence of benefits , or to actual negative or punishing elements ) to Actor , Actor is likely to become explicit and try to negotiate some sort of change in the circumstances of particular shared activities/interests . Thus Actor generates interlocking turn-taking as well as the likelihood , for the first time in their romantic situation , of considerable variability with regard to communication styles , bargaining modes , and process power ? as well as greater variabilities in the degree to which Actor trusts Other , and also how strongly Actor perceives Other is oriented toward maximum joint profit , instead of individual profit ( Scanzoni , 1979a ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a particular shared activity entirely ( ceasing to exchange with regard to it ) , or retain but modify it . Either abolishing or modifying it , in effect , establishes its place ( or that it does not have a place ) within this romantic situation . Thus a pattern with regard to that particular activity is being maintained with the understanding , of course , that it could always be changed through future negotiations . Consequently being in the M/ C phase does not imply that the situation is static . For that reason we have been connecting the labels maintenance/change ? M/C . Based on dialectic assumptions the M/C phase of development is marked in part by continuation of the established arrangements surrounding some shared activities , but also in part simultaneously , by the abolishment of , or modifications within , other shared activities . In short , we assume it to be impossible to disentangle meaningfully the maintenance/change situational phase . However being in M/ C is indicated by more than the emergence of explicit decision-making processes and the continual dynamics of establishing , removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very significantly , the character and nature of both the decision-making processes and outcomes may trigger a transition in the actors ' perceptions of the sorts of gratifications they are receiving and also providing . In effect we argue that the M/ C phase is indicated by Actor 's growing awareness that intrinsic gratifications are commencing to be exchanged . Actor is becoming aware of a love-based commitment , whether or not the prior romantic love feelings are persisting . Recall that the essence of intrinsic exchanges is that the focus shifts primarily from the things and behaviors being exchanged to their // symbolic meanings . Specifically , a mutual sense develops that the actors are becoming committed to each other qua persons . But what stimulates this growing awareness that the person matters , that is , is cared for and loved ? Apart from the vast realm of nonrational feelings that are simply there and that constitute love ( Gordon , 1985 ) , we may suggest that intrinsic gratifications and thus love/ commitment are , in part at least , enhanced by the character of the person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult and tortuous processes and outcomes provide Actor with a sense of how much Other is ( or is not ) concerned with maximum joint profit ( MJP ) instead of primarily his or her own interests . Simultaneously , these dynamics and their outcomes help develop a sense of trust ( or mistrust ) in Other as well as a sense of how cooperative Other is and how fair Other is . Presumably , these several dimensions may be taken as indicators of intrinsic commitment . The specific issues being negotiated and especially the ways they are decided are analogous to gifts ? symbolic of how much Other means to and cares for Actor . Thus effective negotiations generate positive feelings toward Other , that is , a sense that Other is committed ? indeed loves ? Actor qua person . In turn , Actor responds in kind to Other ? enhanced love and intrinsic commitment to Other qua person . Logically , it may be argued that in some cases at least M/C may develop apart from much growth of intrinsic gratifications based on positive decision making . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large array of extrinsic rewards , alongside feelings of love stemming from other ( often nonrational ) sources . Thus a bonding or love/commitment may develop quite apart from satisfactory or effective explicit decisionmaking processes . Either many potentially troublesome issues were never made explicit at all or , if they were , they were not dealt with satisfactorily , and this fact was ignored ? perhaps because of the pair 's overwhelming feelings of love . Very likely the numbers of issues made explicit , the degree of explicitness , and the levels of satisfaction with decision-making processes/ outcomes are dimensions over which couples may vary considerably . A viable hypothesis would be that these kinds of variations have implications for the future course of M/ C. For example , if the initial love/feelings that characterized formation and early M/C ( what Brickman : 178 , calls the passionate M/C segment ) decline somewhat into what Brickman calls the quiet M/ C segment , // then the higher the scores couples have on all three cited dimensions ( numbers , degree , levels ) the more likely they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , because their love/ commitment has a previous history of being tested , they may be more likely to sustain and enhance their love in the face of the gradual diminution of romantic feelings . Brickman calls the third segment of M/ C integral . By this he means couples have now had enough time to synthesize a reasonably satisfactory ratio of rewards ( extrinsic/intrinsic ) to costs so that overall or on balance the relationship is defined as worth maintaining indefinitely . This definition is necessarily accompanied by the expectation that the overall reward/cost ratio , though subject to change , will continue to emerge as reasonably satisfactory . DEVELOPING INTO DISSOLUTION AND BEYOND Figure 5.1 indicates that couples may move not only from formation to M/C , but also to dissolution from either formation or M/C . However the dynamics of moving to dissolution from these two prior phases are necessarily different , owing to the kinds of commitments inherent within them . For example , we learned that a formation phase is characterized largely by extrinsic rewards and implicit decision making . One reason why that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the character of the couple 's decision making as it becomes increasingly explicit . It may be characterized as negative , unsatisfactory , and fraught with regulated conflicts ( Scanzoni and Szinovacz , 1980 ) . Thus the couple 's levels of extrinsic rewards may not rise as rapidly as either Other or Actor may have hoped . At the same time , costs may be rising too rapidly . Concomitantly given that kind of unsatisfactory decision making , there is little indication to Actor that Other cares for him or her qua person . There is an absence of what earlier was characterized as a desire for joint benefits , cooperativeness , trust , and equity during their joint decision making . In short , intrinsic gratifications and the sort of love/commitment those gratifications indicate appear to be lacking . Consequently since neither extrinsic nor intrinsic gratifications are emerging to one or both person 's expectations and/or satisfaction , it can not be said they are moving into M/C . Instead , if their overall reward/cost ratio ? based chiefly on extrinsic items ? continues to become ever more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those extrinsic items is likely // to continue to decline as well . Presumably , persons could remain indefinitely in a dissolution phase of SBPR ( Figure 5.1 ) , characterized by an increasingly unfavorable reward/ cost ratio and declining commitment . Rusbult 's ( 1987 ) research for instance , shows that besides actual exiting from unsatisfying relationships , persons may voice ? an attempt to negotiate explicitly their dissatisfactions . Second , they may exhibit loyalty , which is an attempt " to maintain the status quo " ( p. 28 ) . Their emphasis is on keeping the peace and not rocking the boat , rather than on bringing about meaningful changes in the relationship . Finally , there is neglect ? " basically an ineffectual response , one likely to occur when the individual does n't really know what to do about a troubled relationship and is n't motivated to do much of anything about it " ( p. 228 ) . Perhaps as a result of effective voicing ( negotiation ) , as Figure 5.1 indicates , persons could move into M/ C from dissolution even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement into M/ C from dissolution would presumably be comparable to those just described for movement from formation into M/ C. The major difference of course would lie with the difficult task of reversing the momentum of negative reward/ cost ratios and declining commitments . But if they do not shift to M/ C or remain in dissolution indefinitely , how do we know when they exit out of dissolution and are thus no longer in their SBPR ? The response is both deceptively simple and complex at the same time . If sexual involvement based on the couple 's definition that sex is a legitimate expectation for them ? that they are sexual partners ? is the indicator of entry into this broad type of primary relationship in the first place , then it follows that the cessation of that expectation means that SBPR is finally terminated . The measurement of sexual expectation is crucial . Using such a measurement , the investigator determines when the couple ( hetero-/ homosexual ) becomes sexually involved . Thus it follows that , using that same indicator , the investigator likewise determines when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recall that the investigator also determined that they were in a primary relationship in a general sense based on the four criteria of frequency , intensity , diversity , and duration . Thus their sexually basedprimary relationship may have ended , but not their more general primary relationship . Figure 5.1 suggests that based on the four cited criteria they may still be nonromantic friends or acquaintances , or even be thrown together merely in circumstances of propinquity ( Rusbult , 1987 ) . Thus , as in Figure 5.1 , they develop from dissolution to // the upper right hand block where they may possibly have been together once before . Another possibility is that alongside cessation of sexual interdependence all other exchanges may cease between them as well . Consequently they develop to the lower right hand block of Figure 5.1 indicating that particular reality . In the upper right block they may have a nonsexual close relationship with each other of various sorts ; but in the lower right block they have no primary relationship at all with each other . MAINTENANCE/CHANGE INTO DISSOLUTION Although some couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some may move into a dissolution phase . One element marking their transition as different from persons developing into dissolution directly out of formation is the existence of a history of love/commitment based at least to some extent on intrinsic gratifications . Since their overall reward/cost ratio included those intrinsic gratifications the process of decline is necessarily much more complex ( and personally distressing ) than is dissolution preceded chiefly by a predominance of extrinsic gratifications . There is a growing literature pertaining to the development of M/ C into dissolution ( Spanier and Thompson , 1984 ; Duck , 1982 ; Graziano and Musser , 1982 ; Levinger , 1983 ; Ahrons and Rodgers , 1987 ; Rusbult , 1987 ) . Some of it focuses on situations such as those depicted in Figure 5.1 , which are prior to the addition of the shared statuses identified fully in Figure 5.2 . Figure 5.2 synthesizes the specific statuses discussed in Chapter 4 ? partnership , residence , legal with the broader notion of situational development . The literature suggests that dissolution depicted in Figure 5.2 is more complex than dissolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal marriage in particular , including the ideal of permanence connected with it . Nonetheless , the Figure 5.1 M/ C phase can be exceedingly complex as well . Recall that the partners share a wide range of nonwork activities that supply important socioemotional gratifications in terms of companionship , sexuality , and emotional intimacy . These realms may have begun as exchanges at the extrinsic level , but within M/ C have taken on a great deal of intrinsic significance as well . Indeed they are very likely major elements contributing to the degree of the partners ' commitment . In addition , children may or may not be present ; and the partners also share a common relationship length since first meeting ; since becoming romantically involved . Besides the // shared behaviors and shared compositional factors ( children/length ) each party has his or her own particular orientations that tend to influence his or her own degree of commitment . ( These orientations operate not only during the M/C phase , which is our focus here , but throughout remaining phases as well ) . Rusbult ( 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scanzoni and Arnett ( 1987 ) label that dimension gender-role preferences , and also identify several other orientations that might affect commitment : religious devoutness , individualism , and autonomy or locus of control . Although concurring with Brickman that commitment stems from a complex ratio of rewards and costs , we have not said a great deal about the kinds of orientations that might influence the ratio itself . Individualism and Commitment Farber ( 1964 ) described individualism in terms of permanent availability ; McCall ( 1966 ) called it universal availability ; Scanzoni ( 1968 ) used the term pragmatism ; as do Morgan and Scanzoni ( 1987b ) . In her empirical comparison of U.S. and Dutch cohabitors and legals , Wiersma ( 1983 ) makes individualism , or individuation , the major theoretical fulcrum around which revolve all of her remaining considerations . " Degree of Individuation ' is defined as the act of achieving a balance between the paradoxical dualities implicit in the intimate dyad : the need for individuation or personal separateness on one end , against the need for identification as a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Wiersma : 11 ) . Importantly , she makes the point that ( p. 101 ) " the dual wish for separateness and belonging is equally strong for both types legals as well as cohabitors of couples ; they very much need a sense of togetherness to be able to express their sense of individuality . " She goes on to say ( p. 120 ) that " to be more individuated ( or less a dyadic idealist ) is certainly not an inherent trait of cohabiting couples . It can be found equally among married couples . " In both Wiersma and Morgan and Scanzoni ( 1987b ) degree of individualism is treated as a variable ? with the ascendance of relationship interests placed at one pole , and the ascendance of the individual 's interests at the other pole . The argument can be made that degree of individualism significantly influences ( both consciously and unconsciously ) actors ' sense of their commitment . Hence , among a sample of persons if all other levels of rewards and costs are equal and constant persons scoring higher on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower levels of commitment to their SBPR situation regardless of its current developmental phase ( Scanzoni and Arnett , 1987 ; Morgan and Scanzoni , 1987b ) . Conversely , the less individualistic , or the more permanenceoriented actors are , all other reward/cost elements being comparable , the greater their commitment to their situation is likely to be . This proposition is supported by the positive association between individualism and gender-role modernity , and the positive association of each of these two variables with religious secularism ( Morgan and Scanzoni , 1987a , 1987b ; Bellah et al. , 1985 ) . That is , persons who are more individualistic also prefer greater role interchangeability between men and women in market and home places and also tend to be less religiously devout . Put more plainly , individualistic persons are less religious and less gender traditional , more autonomous and less willing to subordinate their interests . Among comparable empirical circumstances they are more likely to perceive greater costs and fewer rewards than others ; and in seeking to arrive at an overall reward/cost balance ( i.e. , commitment ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wiersma ( p. 121 ) , for instance , reports that individualism , whether among legals or nonlegals , is associated with " partners voicing more severe criticisms about their partnerships , " greater selfassertion and not " perceiving marriage as a haven ' of happiness . " Given Wiersma 's findings regarding the voicing of severe criticisms , it is deemed highly likely that individualism is strongly associated with explicit decision making occurring earlier in the partners ' situational development , and once emerging , to continue to surface very frequently . Moreover individualism is likely to stimulate , during that decision making , a strong desire on Actor 's part for justice and equity , though not necessarily at the expense of caring , joint well-being , trust , or cooperativeness . Bellah et al . ( 1985 ) describe what is undoubtedly the most extreme set of nonindividualistic orientations to be found anywhere in contemporary urban American society ? those held by religious evangelicals . Such persons assign virtually total primacy to the interests of the relationship over those of the individual . They assert that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the respondents in the Bellah et al . study put it , " Only in the Christian faith is it logical ' to say till death do us part . ' Otherwise , if the relationship is giving you trouble , perhaps it is easier to simply dissolve the thing legally , and go your way , than it is to maybe spend five years trying to // work out a problem to make a lasting relationship " ' ( p. 95 ) . Another respondent observes that the philosophy underlying this view of absolute permanence is that since " God does not change " in terms of " his eternal commitment to us , " then a marriage should have that same enduring commitment , and never dissolve either ( p. 96 ) . According to Bellah et al. , such persons hold a strong obligation to legal marriage ? so much so that once in it , leaving it is highly unlikely and undesirable . The interests of the individual especially those of the woman qua individual ? are considered far less significant than those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence ( Morgan and Scanzoni , 1987a ) showing that such persons hold strongly to traditional work/ family roles for the sexes , thus reducing possibilities for negative conflicts stemming from desires for role interchangeability , make a great deal of sense . In terms of identifying situational development from M/C to dissolution , there is no sharp line that couples cross over from one delineated territory to the next any more than there was from formation to M/ C. Instead , there is a transitional area in which some activities are characterized by change , others by maintenance . Owing to the sorts of decision-making processes intrinsic to those changes and/or their absence ( maintenance ) , as well as to fluctuations in satisfactions with the doing of the activities themselves , alongside fluctuation in satisfactions with companionship , sexuality , and emotional intimacy , commitment to the larger situation begins to waver and/or decline . A major factor influencing commitment levels and thus situational development is degree of individualism , because it functions as a mechanism causing Actor and Other to assess their full range of rewards ( extrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their unique shared history , alternatives to this romantic situation currently open to them , implications for any children , reactions of kin/ peers ( including coreligionists ) , and prospects that their current reward/ cost ratio will go up or down in the near future . All of these ( and more ) elements are funneled into their commitment level via degree of individualism . Using Becker 's ( 1960 ) terminology , measures of individualism can be thought of as influencing one 's bet on the future . The bet , or the action of putting money down on a race , for example , represents a commitment to the hope of the horse 's turning the future outcome of the race to one 's advantage . But what would influence one to make , or not make , a particular bet on the future of one 's sexually based primary relationship and thus to persevere in it ? According to Becker ( 1960 : 390 ) : // For a complete understanding of a person 's commitments to a particular situation we need . . . an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bets can be made in the world he sic lives in . What kinds of things are .. . wanted , what losses feared ? What are the good things of life whose continued enjoyment can be staked on continuing to follow a consistent line of action ? . . . To understand commitments fully , we must discover the systems of value within which the mechanisms and processes of specific commitments . . . operate . Individualistic orientations help crystallize " what kinds of things are wanted , " " what kinds of losses are feared , " " what good things in life , and their continued enjoyment , are staked on following one line of action as over against another , " and help define , " What is a pertinent system of values ? " And as they crystallize and recrystallize , such elements tend to influence increased or decreased momentum along the continuum toward ( or away from ) dissolution . Adding Major Shared Statuses Figure 5.1 indicates that couples can move from the formation phase of SBPR directly toward an M/ C phase that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership , legal , residence . Likewise . Figure 5.1 indicates that although couples may currently be in an M/ C phase that does not include those statuses , over time their situation continuing in the M/ C phase may develop to subsume those statuses . Therefore , looking at Figure 5.2 , we assume that couples have moved either from formation or from M/C in Figure 5.1 to M/C phase of the left column of Figure 5.2 . Note however that there are three different M/ C possibilities in Figure 5.2 . The three blocks are organized in terms of the socioeconomic partnership statuses described in Chapter 4 . Recall that both Murdock and Max Weber identified sexual and economic interdependencies as being the two critical foundations of marriage . Modifying those pioneers , we have made shared sexuality the basis of a unique type of close/primary relationship . Now we make economic exchanges a major organizing criterion of these unique relationships . Both theoretically and empirically , partnership is more significant than legal/ residence statuses because it makes little or no sense to conclude that persons are legally joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic partnership . However , a partnership can exist quite independently of and prior to either a legal // bond or coresidence . Partnership , moreover , can exist subsequent to cessation of legal bonds and coresidence , but these later two elements can hardly exist apart from some form of partnership . For example , the literature cited in Chapter 4 shows that for many decades black Americans have in the course of their developing SBPRs . , hared economic resources and maintained varieties and forms of partnerships quite apart from legal bonds and/ or coresidence . Furthermore the suggestion was made that the life-style , evidently common among blacks , of partners dwelling in separate households , may becoming increasingly widespread among whites as well . Consequently , Figure 5.2 divides the three partnership blocks into shared or single versus multiple or separate households . We learned that although the operational definition of single or shared is that the pair maintains merely one household formally , the more critical and overarching variable is physical proximity that applies to both single and multiple household categories in Figure 5.2 . Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , like the ritual of legal marriage , to many persons there is a vital distinction between living together and not . Consequently the current social definition of that behavior leads us to portray the residence variable in attribute terms , even though later research may show that proximity is substantively more significant , regardless of number(s) of households . In order to keep the left side of Figure 5.2 from becoming overly complicated , we simply assert that legal status for either partner is problematic or open-ended in any of the 12 shown permutations . They may be married to each other or not , and if not , perhaps to someone else . Instead of dividing the three partnership blocks by residence , we could have divided each of them by legal status and stated that within either nonlegal or legal category , persons may or may not coreside . But two related reasons argue against that . First , if Figure 5.2 were arranged that way , a casual visual inspection by most persons would lead them to equate legal status with coresidence and nonlegal status with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conversely , making residence instead of legal status the major criterion variable forces readers to ask where legal status is found . Second , it is vital to stimulate that question because , as Gwartney-Gibbs ( 1986 ) and others argue , the chronological sequence among increasing numbers of Americans appears to be coresidence followed eventually by first legal marriage . The proportions of persons simultaneously becoming legal and initially coresident appear to be declining steadily . Consequently , in // spite of lay definitions of the special character of the legal marriage ritual , it can be argued that residence/degree of physical proximity is actually becoming more significant than is legal status in terms of understanding and intervening in contemporary close relationships . And Figure 5.2 reflects that posture . Either Actor/ Other ( or both ) portrayed by Figure 5.1 could be partnered , and/or legal , and/or coresident with a third person ? someone other than the one located with them in Figure 5.1 . If such were the case , it would be an additional factor severely complicating the Actor/ Other ( A/ 0 ) commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A/ 0 shared a major status with someone else , A/ 0 may develop from the formation phase or from M/ C in Figure 5.1 to one of the M/ C possibilities in Figure 5.2 . In effect , as part of their continuing explicit decision making , they begin to discuss an economic partnership . The establishment of this sort of major status changes the character of their broader , overall developing situation/system . Their relationship now subsumes an extraordinarily significant pattern or structure , or set of behaviors . For this reason alone it is vital to make a sharp delineation between situations not possessing an economic pattern ( Figure 5.1 ) and those that do ( Figure 5.2 ) . A second reason for distinguishing between situations that have established economic partnerships from those that have not has to do with the potential effects of such behavioral arrangements on the partners ' commitment levels . Presumably in many cases , the capability to establish and execute an arrangement of this sort increases at least initially each person 's sense of extrinsic rewards , as well as deepening their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision-making processes/ outcomes pertaining to partnership matters were positive feelings of trust , MJP , and cooperativeness , equity would be enhanced , thus strengthening Actor 's feelings that Other " cares for/loves me for myself ? as a person . " Enhancement of commitment owing to greater intrinsic satisfactions holds if their decision-making process/ outcomes occurred as noted . But if Actor wanted a different sort of partnership than Other ( or none at all ) and thus their decision-making process were negative and their outcomes characterized by dissension , intrinsic satisfactions are less likely to be spawned . Nonetheless , the partnership might be established in spite of serious conflicts regarding it because either Actor or Other want the gratifications a particular partnership supplies , and/ or because refusing it might endanger whatever levels of extrinsic/ intrinsic gratifications they presently enjoy . // Indeed if a couple are in either formation or in M/ C in Figure 5.1 and Actor wishes to move to Figure 5.2 and form some sort of partnership , but Other refuses , that refusal could be taken by Actor as an indication of Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual outcome of the refusal could be development into a dissolution phase , as in Figure 5.1 . Rather than risk that possibility , Other may agree to a partnership for now with several future options in mind . One that he or she is willing to risk ( Becker 's bet ) discovering , whether the partnership works or not . Second , he or she may believe that eventually if he or she is patient , the partnership can be changed or even dropped from their relationship . ( Thus they could develop again as in Figure 5.1 . ) It is possible for Actor 's level of commitment to be enhanced upon the establishment of a partnership , but Other 's to remain unchanged . However , it seems likely that on balance each partner 's commitment or cost/ reward ratio is likely to be comparable or else they would not shift from formation into an M/C phase either within Figure 5.1 or within Figure 5.2 . Furthermore , an important factor in assessing that the persons are continuing in an M/ C phase is that their commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 307-308 ) . The greater the divergence in persons ' commitment levels , the more likely it is that the persons are moving into a dissolution phase . Assuming that persons form an economic partnership and are located in Figure 5.2 , the issue of the timing of the two remaining statuses becomes central . For example , among many blacks , some elderly , and apparently increasing members of whites , the partnership exists although persons maintain ? at least for a while ? multiple households . This is the case even though their physical proximity may be quite high , that is , large number of nights ( and nonwork days ) spent together . In contrast to forming a partnership apart from coresidence , other couples may commence both kinds of statuses ( partnership with coresidence ) more or less simultaneously . But whether occurring simultaneously or later on , decision making pertaining to coresidence is presumably more complicated than if the issue is solely partnership . The possible presence of children along with other crucial factors necessarily raise the potential risks/costs of coresidence that must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described here for partnership decision making are comparable for this more complex decision making . Both partners may want coresidence , and achieving it increases levels of extrinsic and intrinsic gratifications and thus commitment . Or Actor may not wish it , and his or her refusal leads // Other to doubt Actor 's commitment and love . As a result of that doubt , Other 's own commitment may be diminished and the possibility of situational development into dissolution is thereby increased . Or Actor may enter coresidence even though not preferring it , lest a refusal endanger other kinds of desired extrinsic/ intrinsic gratifications . The same sorts of reasonings apply to the timing of the legal marriage ritual . Persons may be in Figure 5.1 , either formation or M/ C , and then shift into Figure 5.2 , M/ C phase , and simultaneously establish partnership , coresidence and legal statuses . Although that threefold convergence may have been a common pattern several decades ago among middleclass whites , it is , as Gwartney-Gibbs ( 1986 ) and others suggest , increasingly less common . More common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally into legal status ; or movement into partnership followed by entry into coresidence and legal statuses simultaneously . And as noted , if both partners want legal status , intrinsic and extrinsic commitments are likely to be enhanced considerably . Although Actor may prefer not to be legal , Actor may nonetheless concur with Other 's wish to marry so as to avoid the risk of losing existing gratifications . Thus on balance Actor 's and Other 's commitment levels may tend to be comparable . Or even if they are not comparable ( Other 's may be greater than Actor 's ) their commitment is not sufficiently disparate for the researcher to place them in other than the M/C phase . CONSTRAINT , COMMITMENT , AND HUMAN AGENCY Addressing the possibility that persons may enter and remain in one or more of these three shared statuses even though they may prefer not to do so resurrects the issue of constraint identified earlier in the chapter . Recall that one commitment research tradition emphasizes " pressures from family and friends , legally imposed termination costs , and available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , private pledges , and understandings " ( Kelley , 1982a : 312 ) . Kelley observes that " after a long period of research and debate , the problems inherent in balancing the impacts of constraints versus rewards on commitment are far from being solved . " ( p. 312 ) . Recall that Brickman 's ( 1987 ) strategy ( also Kelley , 1983a : 298 ) was to conceptualize constraints as actual or potential costs and to make the ratio between all manner of costs and gratifications as the basis for commitment or perseverance . Thus for example , in the foregoing circumstances , Actor ( he ) may be // content to be in a Figure 5.1 M/ C circumstance , but Other ( she ) wishes simultaneous economic partnership and coresidence to assist her in the discipline and support of her children . He perceives the partnership and coresidence statuses as constraints and thus as potential costs he wishes to avoid . But in order to maintain the gratifications ( extrinsic/ intrinsic ) he is now receiving from her , he accedes , though not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pressures from her , but because of pressures to do so from friends they both share as well as from members of both his and her kin . Thus , although they begin to share the partnership and residence statuses , he does so under feelings of constraint much more so than of enthusiasm . The same feelings of constraint emerge when she eventually insists on marriage and he ultimately agrees . However , on balance , in spite of the constraints and costs , and alongside his view that he has few alternatives besides her , he perceives the rewards ( including the intrinsic ) of all three shared statuses to outweigh the costs , so that positive ratio leads him to persevere in the M/C phase of their situation , Figure 5.2 . The issue of alternatives is also relevant , say to a woman with few job skills and a number of children , who may perceive few if any intrinsic gratifications from her husband . Thus she and her spouse may be in a dissolution phase but she does not separate because he provides extrinsic rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no other way to attain these kinds of benefits . She is constrained to persevere because , although her current reward/cost ratio may be quite unfavorable , it would become even worse if she separated and tried to maintain her own household . Moreover , let us say that this is the same woman , who is in a Figure 5.1 formation or M/ C phase with the aforementioned man who does not wish the constraint of a partnership and coresidence . Their sexually based primary relationship is covert and unknown to her current husband . But because she defines her nonlegal Other as a viable alternative to her husband , she negotiates simultaneous partnership and residence changes , as noted . She then separates from her legal husband and she and her children move in with Other . Thus she and her second partner are in the head-complement block on the left side of Figure 5.2 , M/ C phase , shared ( though nonlegal ) household . When she eventually obtains her divorce from her husband she negotiates her partner into legal status , even though as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this woman suggests that the thorny issue of constraint and commitment is part of broader questions such as human agency , structural versus negotiated reality , and individualism . For // example , this woman was caught in what the literature ( Johnson , 1982 ) refers to as structural constraints . Her minimal commitment to her husband was based solely on things he was providing for her . But in developmental fashion , she developed a second parallel commitment . ' That additional SBPR supplied a set of gratifications ( mostly intrinsic ) that she was not receiving from her other SBPR . Hence , this alternative arrangement enabled her to escape her former structural constraints and eventually , after much struggle with her new Other , to enter a relationship characterized by a high ratio of gratifications ( intrinsic/extrinsic ) to costs , and hence , to which she is strongly committed . The question becomes , across a sample of women caught by the foregoing structural constraints , what would explain why some remained caught , while others developed as did this woman ? Based on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could be argued that among women who are equally constrained those who are more highly individualistic , less religiously devout , and more autonomous are the ones most likely over time to engage in whatever actions are required to escape those constraints . Not all women might engage in the same patterns as noted ; some might explore gaining their own alternative extrinsic resources through labor force participation . But the desire and willingness to engage in the kind of human agency necessary to try to escape structural constraints is probably inhibited by minimal individualism , high devoutness , and low autonomy . For example , developing a covert affair while married is still regarded by many persons as nonconventional . Women who are religious , and less individualistic and less autonomous are much less likely to be nonconventional in any terms ? not just sexual ? and thus to remain structurally constrained . Brickman ( 1987 : 245 ) observes that " the experience of being caught or trapped in this manner will be painful . " Over time he says ( p. 246 ) the constraints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gratifications . The question for the researcher is to identify points at which that pain becomes defined as too great to bear along with the variables that influence that definition , as well as any actions taken to remedy the pain . The issue of structural realities , as with structuralism in general , is open to intense scrutiny and investigation in connection with actors ' definitions of those realities ( Turner , 1985 ) . Some constraints may indeed exist beyond actors ' capabilities to define them in other than limiting terms . But as Giddens ( 1981 ) indicates , other kinds of elements may be defined as either constraints or enablings . For instance , a plant shuts down in a // smokestack city that is dependent on the plant . The husband defines that event as severely constraining his own life and his family 's life-style , while at the same time hoping the plant will eventually reopen . In contrast the wife ( a complement to her husband ) defines that same event in enabling terms . This event is their opportunity , she thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them can obtain jobs . She has never been able to find work in their depressed city , and moving has not been an option , owing to her husband 's high union wages . Thus she has been constrained by his job from what she wanted . Now that his job is gone , the alternative that was once unrealistic suddenly becomes very salient and tangible to her , although not so to him . Movement Within and Across Major Statuses What this woman wants is to shift from the upper left block of Figure 5.2 to the center left block . They are currently in an M/ C phase , legal , coresident , and she holds a complement status . But her gender-role orientations have been changing in a less traditional direction . In short , she has been experiencing adult individual development . She has been changing gradually and now her broader environment has suddenly changed as well . The upshot is that she now engages her husband in decision making to establish a change in partnership status ( to senior/junior ) within their overall SBPR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision making occurring within Figure 5.2 are similar to those considered in Figure 5.1 . Effective decision making resulting in consensus and perceived equity increases the levels of extrinsic rewards at the same time that it tends to increase the sense of intrinsic gratifications . The result of both levels of rewards is likely to be increased commitment to the relationship . And although that result might have emerged had they changed cities as well as partnership status , the husband of the woman in question refuses to do so . As time passes the plant remains closed and the woman 's sense of inequity over denied extrinsic resources continues to grow , as does her resentment toward her husband . Her commitment to the relationship , though not necessarily declining , is not growing . She next suggests that she herself move with one of their two children to the sunbelt city to work , and send money to him as well ? that is , they would have a commuting arrangement . In Figure 5.2 terms , this time she is proposing ( left center block ) legal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // allow her to go , in spite of considerable negotiation and conflict over the matter . His continued lack of cooperation during decision making seriously undermines her sense of intrinsic gratifications , to say nothing of her growing sense of loss of extrinsic benefits . Consequently , her commitment to him is diminishing and in effect she is shifting ( in Figure 5.2 , head-complement block , shared household ) from M/ C phase to dissolution phase . Simultaneously , her reduced inputs to him ( both extrinsic and intrinsic ) undermine his sense of commitment to her as well . In spite of constraints ? economic , along with closely knit kin and friends and religious strictures prohibiting such behaviors ? she takes both children with her to Sunbelt City . Their relationship may now be located in the left center block ( junior/ senior partners , multiple households , they get together at least two weekends per month ) dissolution phase . There is no fixed chronology regarding where their relationship might next shift throughout the varied permutations of Figure 5.2 , left column . Indeed , predicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing a certain array of variables permits the scientist/ practitioner to state the probabilities of particular elements occurring . In this instance , should no new events intervene , one might predict continued dissolution and eventual actual termination of the SBPR.3 On the other hand , should she tire of the economic struggle and loneliness of a strange city , those costs might drive her back to the upper left block of Figure 5.2 ? living with her husband in an ongoing dissolution phase . In turn , the shock of having had to live alone combined with her subsequent willingness to live with him again might stimulate him to change and provide the sorts of extrinsic/intrinsic gratifications that might help them develop from dissolution to a renewed M/C phase . Analogous to the weather , any other shifts are possible for this couple throughout Figure 5.2 , left column . It is highly unlikely , however , that this couple would , let us say , ever move into an egalitarian partnership , M/ C phase , regardless of legal or residential status . But given the notions of adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter 3 , anything is possible ; no set of permutations or circumstances for any couple can be ruled out a priori . A fundamental assumption underlying Figure 5.2 is that over time the SBPR of Actor/ Other can move into any or all of the permutations displayed regarding development phase , or partnership , legal , and residence status , as well as number of children that might be present . Moreover after having left one or more // permutations , later on they can again repeat them . However since both they and the character of their relationship will necessarily have been altered ( their environment , including the aging of any children , is likely to have changed as well ) the repetition will not be cloned . Instead it will be a different experiencing of comparable developmental permutations . If we were to use the convention of arrows to illustrate those possibilities , there would be an arrow from every one of the 12 permutations in left block of Figure 5.2 to every other one , to say nothing of enlarging the permutations by the explicit display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recall that we identified a woman who at one point had a Figure 5.2 legal relationship with man A and a Figure 5.1 relationship with man B. Earlier we cited Richardson 's ( 1985 ) study of new other women whose men have relationships with them as well as with their wives . If the new woman and the man have established some sort of egalitarian economic partnership , then the man has two relationships located in left column of Figure 5.2 . Even clearer is the case of a man and the old other woman , supported in mistresslike fashion as , say , a junior partner or complement . They can be said to be in partnership , and thus this man has two relationships in the left side of Figure 5.2 . Moreover , it is logically possible for the old or the new woman ? as well as the man ? to be maintaining two relationships in left Figure 5.2 and/or Figure 5.1 . Indeed the potential permutations can be quite varied . For instance , persons C and D may or may not be legal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any partnership form . Simultaneously the same conditions apply to C and E as well as to D and F. Moreover if C 's relationship with E is hidden from D , C is likely to feel guilty ; if it is not , D is likely to feel jealous ( Brickman , 1987 : 245ff ) . But if D also maintains a relationship with F , that is likely to mitigate how C and D feel , depending on whether the D-F relationship is covert or overt . Whatever the circumstances , says Brickman , multiple commitments to relationships may produce guilt , jealousy , and other forms of stress . Research on multiple relationships tends to be relatively sparse ( Weis , 1983 ; Cuber and Harroff , 1965 ; Atwater , 1982 ) and perhaps one reason is the hesitancy of respondents to risk divulging information of this sort pertaining either to current , past , or intended behaviors . Nonetheless , the literature has long identified the importance of alternative relationToward // ships in general because alternatives may have a significant impact on the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually based relationships is that researchers have seldom conceptualized relationships in the developmental fashion suggested by Figure 5.1 and 5.2 , The tendency has been to treat multiple relationships as deviant , or outside the mainstream of legitimate family life . Married persons may be having an affair , but substantively and conceptually that deviancy is treated as something wholly other from legal marriage.4 At most , the tendency has been to recognize that persons might be having an affair around the time of separation/ divorce , and to acknowledge that the affair may be either a cause of divorce or a consequence of declining marital gratifications . However , data showing gradual increases since Kinsey of married persons of both sexes having intercourse with other than legal spouses ( Weis , 1983 ; Ehrenreich et al. , 1986 ; Atwater , 1982 ) suggests that a fresh look be taken at the entire matter . For instance a basic question is how much of this sexual activity is what earlier in the chapter was called prerelationship ( zygotic ) encounters ? Or , if some of it can be described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the terms of the relatively simple Figure 5.1 model ? How much of it can be captured in terms of the more complex Figure 5.2 model ? How much of it is covert , or overt ? which Weis ( 1983 ) calls consensual ? ? Above all , the researcher/practitioner must transfer the issue from the realm of the deviant to the developmental . For example , what are the conditions under which persons in ongoing relationships do or do not engage in sexual encounters ? Presently , the evidence is mixed regarding correlations between degree of commitment levels and likelihood of encounters ( Weis , 1983 ) . Perhaps past measures of commitment failed to distinguish sufficiently between extrinsic and intrinsic gratifications , hence , it may be the extrinsically committed who are more likely to experience encounters . And what are the conditions under which a zygotic encounter for a committed person may develop into a second relationship ? A committed person may develop a nonsexual friendship with Other ( upper right , Figure 5.1 ) and because one is falling in love with Other , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person prior to becoming sexual with Other . Thus while technically the person does not have two simultaneous SBPRs , the prospects of an imminent alternative to his or her present one influences the person in ending the first one . Furthermore what are the dynamics of managing two committed relationships simultaneously ? What factors // affect duration of multiple or overlapping relationships ? And what are the conditions under which one relationship persists but the other relationship ceases ? What are the connections between multiple relationship development and children , as well as with legal , residential , and partnership status ? Is individualism a salient variable among persons maintaining multiple relationships ? Given the increasing redefinitions of contemporary sexuality , described earlier , divesting it almost entirely from legal bonds , plus the evidence of increasing extralegal sex , plus the increasing labor force participation of women and the concomitant declines in physical proximity between spouses that that often entails , it would appear that the issue of multiple partnerships , and their connections with commitment and situational development are features intrinsic to any rethinking of families and close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in spite of secular unease with it , s emerging empirical realities force the researcher/ practitioner to place the issue of multiple relationships in a more central theoretical position and to remove it from the deviant category . Earlier we observed that logically , Actor/ Other could traverse all of the permutations of the left side of Figure 5.2 together . Alongside that proposition must be added a second , namely , that over time either Actor or Other or both may experience those same permutations with one or more additional persons . Logically , there are no limits either on permutations or on persons.6 Although conceptually and empirically it may be less complicated to think in terms of discrete boundaries surrounding the family at any given time ( Pitts , 1964 ) , the realities appear to be that ongoing variation in relationship commitment and development can not be fully understood apart from at least considering the phenomenon of multiple relationships . The lack of past research into this issue suggests a tacit acceptance of folk ideals based on the primacy of the nuclear family paradigm . Shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove this issue from the realm of folk ideals and allow it to be pursued chiefly on the grounds of presumed scientific importance . Development out of the Sexually Based and Status-Encumbered Primary Relationship Not all persons at any given time ? or perhaps ever ? experience multiple relationships . Some couples may experience sequential relationToward // ships in which entry into a new SBPR is preceded by the actual termination of a previous one . And , of course , other couples may remain indefinitely in any one of the permutations of the left column of Figure 5.2 , including a dissolution phase . Some couples remaining indefinitely in the left column may over time , as discussed in Chapter 4 , negotiate numerous changes in partnership statuses , and/or negotiate changes in residency/physical proximity . Some of these pairs may even experience changes in marital status ? Actor and Other may separate and/or divorce ; but remarry each other and/or coreside later on . Among this full range of possible changes in statuses ? legal , residence , partnership ? there may or may not be accompanying shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolution to a renewed and revised M/C . Added to these realities is the possibility that some couples may develop out of SBPR , but later develop back into SBPR with the same person as before . These varied complexities require us to focus more specifically on what is meant by developing out of an SBPR that has been encumbered or characterized by one or more of the three major statuses . Recall that in connection with Figure 5.1 , we said that couples moved out of a dissolution phase upon cessation of their sexual interdependence . Using the same instruments ( both behavioral and subjective definitional dimensions ) that measure entry into a sexual relationship , the investigator would determine the cessation of that relationship . But once the sexually based relationship comes to include one or more of the three statuses ( as in Figure 5.2 ? including the possibility of child responsibilities ) then the identification of cessation becomes a considerably more intricate matter . Intricacies and complexities are especially pronounced when one takes into account the legal dimension and its demarcating events of marriage and divorce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research on blacks in which she despaired of using conventional concepts ? household , family , marriage , matrifocal , and so forth ? to describe the empirical realities she was uncovering . As these kinds of empirical realities become increasingly widespread in white society , some investigators , such as Duncan and Morgan ( 1985 ) , are struggling to devise concepts to apprehend these complexities validly . Ahrons ( 1979 ) for instance , based on a study of a rural ( mostly white ) Wisconsin county , uses binuclear family to encompass both the maternal and paternal households following divorce . Children pass back and forth , she says , between two nuclear households that may or may not be of equal primary significance in a child 's life . And in a subsequent analysis , Ahrons and Rodgers // ( 1987 ) trace processes of separation , divorce , and remarriage , and provide helpful policy suggestions for binuclear , that is , blended families . Nonetheless , after having used the term family throughout their study they acknowledge in their closing policy section that family is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 213 ) . This conceptual morass is one reason why scientists/ practitioners need to think in terms of a more generalizing construct than the family or families . Based on the construct of SBPR and using Figure 5.2 , we may suggest some ways to describe movement out of that kind of relationship when it is status-encumbered . Assuming that a couple is in a dissolution phase , they may be located in any one of the three partnership segments of the left column of Figure 5.2 . Let us say they are also legal and coreside . If in the ongoing course of dissolution , Actor or Other moves into a second household , they may still remain sexual with each other as defined by both objective and subjective ( their own definitions and perceptions ) criteria . If they are sexual ( their physical proximity as defined by overnights may be significant ) , they remain in the left column , whether or not they have mere sexual encounters with others , or even an additional sexual relationship . If by the the upper right segment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment postsexual in the same sense that the upper right segment of Figure 5.1 was called nonsexual/presexual . This couple still shares legal status as well as one of the three types of partnership forms. ? If there are children , they continue to share responsibilities for their material and emotional well-being . Placing them in a post sexual segment is based on the assumption that if sexuality is the indicator of a unique type of primary relationship , then its cessation ( by the partners ' definition ) must mark the end of that unique relationship . Recall that sex is not only a vehicle for extrinsic rewards , it may also become a critical indicator of intrinsic gratifications as well . Hence , it can be argued and tested that the cessation of sexuality indicates the removal of a critical reservoir of intrinsic bases of a couple 's commitment to one another . Thus the character of their relationship has been altered significantly . Indeed so much so that it may be considered a different kind of relationship . The postsexual classification takes on additional significance when we consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a partnership , but who over time , whether explicitly or implicitly , cease to define sexual exchanges as a legitimate expectation for their relationship . Based on their exhaustive review of sexuality in later-life // marriages , Garza and Dressel ( 1983 : 101 ) conclude that " gradual declines in sexual activity , interest , and quality continue into the later years of marriage . " But whether older or mid-life or younger , if the researcher concludes ( based on the partners ' definitions ) that they have become postsexual with one another , they are placed in the upper right segment.8 That is the case even though they may live in a shared household , and remain legal . But whether they now belong in M / C or in dissolution in the upper right segment is more problematic . Given the absence of commitment based on such a crucial source ( sexuality ) of extrinsic and intrinsic gratifications , we might hypothesize that with the cessation of sexuality they are likely to develop into dissolution . In any event , they could remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extrinsic rewards . Thus they have a primary relationship based not on sex , nor on friendship as in the next example , but evidently chiefly on propinquity . Their commitment stems from few or no intrinsic sources . Nonetheless , there is a commitment based on a ratio of constraints/costs and rewards that makes it appear more worthwhile for them to stay together than to go their own ways . Nonetheless , it is quite possible for postsexual situations to be characterized by an M/C phase , as Figure 5.2 suggests . Such persons may or may not dwell in the same household ; and they may or may not be legal . But they have developed a postsexual friendship characterized by emotional intimacy sufficient enough for them to maintain commitment based on the intrinsic gratifications such intimacy supplies . For instance Ahrons and Rodgers ( 1987 ) label certain divorced persons as " perfect pals . " They not only " talk , " they are often seen together at community functions involving their children ( p. 122 ) . But one does not have to experience divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature on long-term middle and older marriages is relatively sparse and not always adequate ( Brubaker , 1983 ; Brubaker and Ade-Ridder , 1984 ) , among some of them , comradeship and intimacy may well place them in an M/ C phase , even if they have developed into a postsexual situation . These sorts of intrinsic gratifications would be in addition to whatever extrinsic rewards exist , or whatever obligations/ duties/ constraints there may be in their situation . A particularly intriguing research problem would be based on couples who continue to define themselves as sexual ( it remains a normative basis of their relationship ) but they seldom if ever engage in any sorts of physical affection , or any sexual activities whatsoever . These couples could be compared with those just defined as postsexual . Given their behavioral similarities , the question is why they differ significantly in // their definitions and perceptions of the sexuality dimension . To answer that question the investigator would , among other things , examine the potential influences of individualism , religious devoutness , gender-role preferences , multiple partnerships , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following genuinely developmental logic , it is possible that some persons ? especially those who are younger ? who develop into a postsexual relationship could perhaps develop back into a sexual relationship . However , there is some evidence that among persons who separate and again coreside , and so forth , that eventually their fluctuating relationship comes to a final termination point ( Kitson and Raschke , 1981 ) . SINGLE PARENT COMPLEXITIES The burgeoning single parent phenomenon provides another way of viewing the complexity of development from sexual to nonsexual relationships . Technically , a single parent resides in a household with his or her children but not with his or her legal spouse ( Thompson and Gongla , 1983 ) . Although a married couple may reside in separate households , if they continue to be sexual they would remain in left column of Figure 5.2 , let us say in a dissolution phase . Thus if she has the children , she is classified as a single parent , even though she remains sexually and economically involved with her husband . If they cease to be sexually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? separate households , dissolution phase . That is a very different circumstance than her former one , although she continues to be classified as a single parent . If she develops a new SBPR , that new relationship may be located either in Figure 5.1 or left column of Figure 5.2 . This occurs simultaneously with her postsexual relationship with her legal husband . If that latter relationship is not based on friendship or cooperation , Ahrons and Rodgers ( 1987 ) say , they may be " angry associates " or " fiery foes . " Such persons may be obligated to interact because of child custody and visitation matters , or economic matters , including child support . In effect , theirs is another variation on the notion of the primary relationship of propinquity just described . Indeed , if couples in the left side of Figure 5.2 , dissolution phase , have no children , and no property disputes , and no continuing friendship or acquaintanceship , they would likely develop directly from dissolution to the lower center segment of Figure 5.2 , and cease all interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , develop to the lower center segment from the right segment ? for example , their postsexual friendship // dissolves and they simply cease all contacts . The single parent in question may be a " fiery foe " with her husband and simultaneously coreside with her new partner ? left side of Figure 5.2 , M/C phase , junior partner . The fact that all of these several permutations subsume what is technically called a " single parent " suggest that Ahrons and Rodgers ( 1987 : 107 ) are correct in calling that label a " misnomer . " Their particular misgivings about the construct of single parent come from evidence suggesting that in many cases the blood father continues to be significantly involved in his children 's development . And of course , the foregoing single parent 's cohab can not easily avoid some involvement in these children 's development even if he wanted to do so . Given such involvements , Ahrons and Rodgers assert that the term single parent , as equivalent to " father absence " or " male absence , " is quite meaningless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the family will remain useful lay terms , even though their scientific precision and significance are highly problematic at best . What Figures 5.1 and 5.2 do 11 is place the issue of parents ( whether sociological or biological ) and children in a larger context of what was called in Chapter 1 , " varieties of development . " In short , investigators and practitioners need to think ink terms of the developing child being affected by , but just as surely affecting , the developing adults in his or her life , as well as affecting the developing relationships of those same adults . Concomitantly , those three varieties of development mutually interact with the developing child/ parent relationship ( see Figure 7.1 ) . From that perspective , one focuses not so much on the static notion " single parent , " but instead on the implications for both children and adults of situational development 11 in Figure 5.1 and 5.2 , including the various permutations of major shared statuses that may occur within SBPR , and in many instances extend beyond it into a postsexual situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROSPECTS FOR THE POSTSEXUAL , STATUS-ENCUMBERED PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP The construct of the postsexual primary relationship serves to underscore our focus on elements other than conventional lay or folk terms to try to apprehend validly the complexities of contemporary primary situations . Earlier , we said that of the two dimensions that the classic literature asserts as structuring a unique relationship , sexuality is the more fundamental for numerous reasons . But once into the development of that situation , economic matters become extraordinarily // pivotal . Closely connected with economic interdependence are legal and residence matters , both of which can be said to be ( in law and custom ) inherently connected with the economic partnership . Furthermore , the fascinating phenomenon is that for some couples over time , the importance of sexuality in providing either extrinsic or intrinsic gratifications as a basis for their commitment diminishes . Sexual gratifications may be replaced by a ratio of other sorts of intrinsic gratifications and extrinsic rewards ( chiefly economic ) to certain costs in the form of constraints ? for example , lack of viable economic alternatives , and/ or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based commitments may be replaced entirely by commitments stemming from economic resources and constraints ? few if any intrinsic satisfactions remain ( Cuber and Harroff , 1965 ) . Couples sharing some sorts of intrinsic gratifications would be likely to be found in the M/ C phase of the upper right segment ( postsexual ) of Figure 5.2 ; those sharing minimal intrinsic satisfactions are likely to be found in a dissolution phase . And as we said earlier , some couples may continue to define sex as normative for them ? thus remaining in the left side of Figure 5.2 ? even though their erotic behaviors differ hardly at all from those in the postsexual phases . And very likely , the majority of couples in these several permutations continue to be legal and to share a household . Other arrangements ( e.g. , single parent ) discussed earlier that are also subsumed by the upper right segment are not considered here . The research issues stimulated by the arrangements in question fall into two related categories ? first , questions focusing on their current dynamics and patterns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or downward in their frequency . For example , a critical question has to do with how , over time , such situations evolved , including whether or not they currently define themselves as sexual partners . Since it is not likely they were explicitly negotiated , what was the nature of the silent bargains and tacit agreement that resulted in that evolution ? Are these cases in which over the years physical proximity has always been low , owing , say , to business travel , so that the cessation of sexuality became imperceptibly more real than its presence ? And while the measurement of commitment and its predictors is crucial in all sexually based situations , that matter seems especially important here . What is the nature and basis of their commitments given that , although outwardly they are in circumstances ( legal and coresidence status ) that prescribe it , normatively and/or // behaviorally , sexuality is not a basis for their commitment ? Related to this and to their history of physical proximity and business travels are the matters of casual sexual encounters and possible actual multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual gratifications outside of their relationship ? Are these sorts of gratifications covert or consensual between them ? In addition , do these kinds of persons regard sexuality in general as relatively less important , say , than other bases for commitment ? Recall that Bellah et al . ( 1985 ) found that marital commitment based on the constraint of duty and obligation was strongest among religious conservatives . In that connection , Garza and Dressel 's ( 1983 : 102 ) literature review showed that among older married persons " religious devoutness is inversely related to sexual frequency ; further , devoutness mitigates the impact of sexual performance on marital satisfaction . " In short , it could be argued that religion plays a major role among couples currently in postsexual situations also characterized by coresidence and legal status and also among couples who are normatively but not behaviorally sexual partners . Religious conservatives currently in age cohorts of 40 and above are highly likely to devalue sexuality . These older conservatives predate efforts to eroticize and glamorize fundamentalist marital sexuality ( Lewis and Brissett , 1986 ; Ehrenreich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to maintain marital commitments primarily out of duty and obligation , irrespective of sex . For them , the status of being permanently married is a far more compelling gratification ? and thus a basis for commitment ? than anything they are likely to have ever known about sexuality . Consequently , in calculating the prospects for the pervasiveness of these kinds of situations , one must consider religion . One must also consider women 's growing labor force participation because , very likely , many if not most of the women in these conventional desexed situations are complements . As such , throughout their lives and marriages they have been economically dependent on their husbands . Religion connects here as well because even younger women who are more devout expect to work less frequently than less devout women ( Morgan and Scanzoni , 1987a ) . Devoutness is also inversely linked with individualism and that too as we saw tends to be inversely linked with commitment . The upshot is , given the continuing increases in women 's labor force participation ( and accompanying gender-role modernity , Scanzoni , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing emphasis on lifelong sexual pleasure as an inherent right ( Ehrenreich et al. , 1986 ) , that the frequency of commitments characterized by legality // and coresidence ? but having lost their sexual bond or basis ( either normatively and/or behaviorally ) ? is likely to decline . Persons in SBPR with minimal sexual satisfactions and in a dissolution phase are probably less likely than ever before to tolerate either that dissolution phase or development into the particular types of postsexual situations that are expected to continue indefinitely and/ or monogamously , or be characterized by continuing coresidence and/or legality . Movement into separate households , eventual legal termination , and the formation of other sexually based relationships are likely to be viewed as more viable options than what Cuber and Harroff ( 1965 ) termed a utilitarian marriage , in which sexuality can be said to be absent , or perhaps present , but just barely . At the same time in spite of efforts to eroticize marital sexuality , religious conservatives are still the ones most likely to devalue sexual pleasure when compared to other bases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nonbehavioral ) situations characterized by coresidence and legality are most likely to continue to be located in that segment of the population . Summary The chapter began by concurring with Bernard that the core research question for primary relationships is not " Are you married ? " but " How committed are you ? " Commitment is defined as perseverance in a course of action . Within sexually based primary relationships , considerable overlap exists between love and commitment . Among many other things , love tends to be based on nonrational intrinsic gratifications , sacrifices , and affirmation of persons qua persons , quite apart from bargaining . Commitment may also include intrinsic elements ; thus the overlap with love . But commitment may also contain large elements of extrinsic rewards in which elements of equity and negotiation are quite salient . Ultimately , commitment is based on the ratio of gratifications ( extrinsic/ intrinsic ) and costs ( constraints , punishments , duties , obligations ) , and so on . Commitment is thus a complex amalgam of have to and want to . Sex is initially considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often tends later on to become connected with feelings of romantic love , as well as with intrinsic bases of commitment . Although sex is the initial basis for a unique type of primary relationship , the relationship itself may develop to include a broad range of additional gratifications and costs influencing commitment . Relationship development is characterized initially by a formation phase in which commitToward // ment is based chiefly ( but never exclusively ) on extrinsic rewards . The character of both patterns and decision-making processes throughout this phase differ significantly from what they become during later phases . The patterns consist of explorations and testing of a rapidly increasing tempo of behavioral activities . The decision-making processes surrounding them are largely implicit in nature . Development into a maintenance/ change phase is characterized by the emergence of explicitness pertaining to decision making regarding changes in activities they currently share , introduction of additional activities , and removal of others . The character of their explicit decision making may contribute toward the emergence of intrinsic gratifications , and thus a more profound commitment than exists during a formation phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern and cooperativeness are analogous to the classic anthropological description of gifts ? symbolic of Actor 's concern and love for Other qua person . Instead of developing to M/C , couples may develop directly from formation to dissolution . As a result of ineffective decision making , extrinsic rewards do not grow , intrinsic gratifications fail to emerge , and commitments decline . Couples who develop into an M/C phase may remain there indefinitely , or else develop into dissolution . Among the orientations influencing direction of development is level of individualism . Individualism acts as a kind of funnel channeling the full array of intrinsic/extrinsic gratifications ? as well as costs ? on to degree of commitment . Consequently , as the couple passes through inevitable changes during the course of being in M/C , individualism becomes one element affecting persons ' assessments of those changes ( or the lack thereof ) . Thus , among couples experiencing identical cost/ reward ratios during M/ C , those with greater individualism probably exhibit less commitment and are more likely to develop toward a dissolution phase . At some point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three major shared statuses ( legal , partnership , residential ) to their relationship . Encumbering the relationship in this fashion changes its character considerably by raising the stakes of potential costs and rewards thus affecting their commitment positively or negatively . The economic partnership dimension is deemed to be the most significant of the three because it can exist apart from the other two , but presumably those two can not exist in any meaningful social sense apart from some form of partnership . Shifting into and among these varied statuses may very often be characterized by constraints and costs as well as rewards . Presumably , persons add these statuses to their relationship because // they perceive their overall reward/ cost ratio will be greater if they do so than if they do not . Moreover , what are perceived as constraints by some persons may be defined as enablings by others . Once persons have encumbered or added to their relationship one or more of the three shared statuses , there are numerous permutations they may experience . There is no a priori chronology indicating how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is possible to experience those permutations with more than one partner ; and indeed to do so in terms of overlapping multiple relationships . The issue of multiple relationships ? having been removed from the deviant category ? has important theoretical and practical implications for our understanding of contemporary situational development over time . Development may also occur out of a sexually based relationship into a postsexual situation . Such persons may or may not remain legal and/ or coresident . They may or may not remain indefinitely in a M/ C phase ( possessing certain nonsexual intrinsic gratifications ) , or in a dissolution phase ( characterized chiefly by extrinsic rewards and/ or constraints ) . Like families or the family , the term single parent is a convenient folk term but contains very little scientific precision . The postsexual situation is a useful construct for capturing some of the complexities inherent among developing relationships between children and adults being uncovered by current research . The postsexual situational construct is also a useful means to capture relationships ? often legal and coresident ? in which rewards and constraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , form the basis of commitment . While the frequency of such situations is likely to decline during the years ahead , the probability of identifying them remains greatest among religious conservatives . // MUTUAL INFLUENCES BETWEEN THE DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIP AND ITS DEVELOPING ENVIRONMENT Given its extraordinary significance for interpersonal commitment ? " whatever its commitment , the current interpersonal relationship must include a commitment to continuing negotiation " ( Raush , 1977 : 182 ) ? this chapter examines the character of joint decision making in greater detail . However , it addresses these micro issues in conjunction with certain macro considerations . It has been assumed that micro relationships are pretty much at the mercy of their environments . Based on the version of systems theory described in Chapter 3 , the most valid image of the linkages between the environment and the sexually based primary relationship would appear to be one based on mutual feedbacks over time . We are thus back to the issue of human agency and constraints , which has surfaced repeatedly throughout the book . How free are persons to create and recreate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely limited in what is possible and attainable ? Are persons ' relationships largely at the mercy of their surrounding environments ? Increasingly , joint decision making is being viewed as a vehicle helping to address those broad issues ( Moen , 1985 ; Turner , 1985 ) . The close relationship is in continual development or flux , but so is its environment ( Eisenstadt and Helle , 1985 ) . Both are continually shifting and shifts at one level are assumed to bring about shifts at the other . Joint decision making becomes part of the social mechanism connecting macro/ micro levels . The task of this chapter is to begin to sketch some of the connections between the developing relationship and its developing environment . What Decision Making Is Not Unfortunately , there are a number of commonly held misconceptions regarding what we are calling decision making . One is that it is explicit 142 // or overt . Sometimes it is , but at other times it is implicit , silent , or merely understood ( Strauss , 1978 ; Scanzoni and Szinovacz , 1980 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on unsaid cues and clues ( including body language ) is an essential element to consider . Second , the matter of decision making should not be considered rational in any objective sense ? in terms of the value system of outsiders . Instead , the assumption is that persons act individually , or jointly , based on the best , although necessarily limited , information available to them at any given time . And they act to achieve the interests and goals that are relevant and important to them at that time irrespective of what outsiders deem appropriate or as being in their best interests ( Moore et al. , 1986 ) . Third , no assumption is made that decision making is unconstrained . In many instances there may be no desirable options or choices available to persons in the situations at all ; nevertheless , we argue that the matter of environmental constraints should be thought of as a continuum ? high to low . Moreover , the investigator needs to consider that partners in the situation may hold varying definitions and perceptions regarding their milieu . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that causes both persons to lose their jobs , a constraint for Actor but , conversely for Other , an enabling opportunity ? Constraints and Enablings : The Situation and Its Environment Figure 6.1 indicates that while the environment influences the situation , over time , the situation may in certain respects influence its environment . Drawing on Blumer , Buckley ( 1967 , pp. 145-146 ) observes that while environment influences persons , people " act toward and interpret their situations , whether in formal or informal associations , such that streams of new situations arise and old situations become unstable ' and behavior takes on a processual character of creation and recreation of meanings and expectations . " Giddens ( 1981 : 169 ) contends that if the environment " is conceived of as merely external ' to human action , it becomes regarded as a sort of autonomous form , independent of such action : or worse , as determining such action wholly through social causes ' . " Calling that premise into question , Giddens argues , " there can be no theoretical defense for supposing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptually separated from the long-term institutional development of society " ( p. 173 ) . What Giddens is questioning is what Chafetz ( 1984 : 4 ) calls the " structuralist " approach . Chafetz argues ( p. ix ) , that gender stratification , for instance , is a " structural variable . " She contends that " the explanation of a structural feature is to be found in examining other structures , not micro- level phenomena .... Individuals are affected by structure , but the understanding of structure is not enhanced by the study of individuals " ( p. ix ) . In contrast to Giddens , Chafetz is saying that macro features are external to situational action ? autonomous from and independent of it ; and also that macro features are the determinant of situational action through " social " causes , apart from any feedback on them from the micro situation . Like Chafetz , Huber and Spitze ( 1983 : 44 ) describe how the environment constrains the situation but say little as to how the situation feeds back on its own milieu . The constraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions implicitly accepted by , or imposed on , individuals . . . they may well operate below the level of consciousness , but they may still constrain thought and behavior . " However , Giddens argues that human " action " implies both " capability " and " knowledgeability . " The latter refers to knowing , at least to // some degree , what options , if any , are available to pursue ; the former refers to the freedom to select desired options . Contrary to many macro analysts Giddens argues that the environment may sometimes enable as well as constrain ? it supplies resources as well as rules . The significance of Giddens ' enabling insight is that sexually based situations are to some degree able to draw on those environmental elements in which they are enmeshed in order to negotiate ways of organizing their relationships that would not otherwise be possible . Thus the many changes in sexually based situations of the past several decades could not have occurred were not a number of macro areas ( demographic , law , economic structure , culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or action in terms of emerging patterns of divorce , remarriage , fertility control , sexuality , cohabitation , women 's occupational activities , and so forth , have been facilitated by the shifting character of macro areas . But Giddens would argue that the ongoing historic alterations within relationships have , in feed-forward fashion , contributed to ongoing change in their larger environment . Thus the environment has been transformed because relationships are being transformed ; and relationships are different because their milieu is shifting . To be sure , we can not ignore what Giddens ( 1981 : 176 ) calls " givens , " that is , certain structured practices upon which situations appear to exercise very little if any feedback . These would include some forms of gender and racial inequalities within economic or political institutions , or historical forces such as the Great Depression , and within certain industries entire categories of occupations gradually disappear to be replaced by new types of work niches . As Moen ( 1985 : 116 ) puts it , there are " very real dynamics of the labor market " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she adds , " there is much research to be done showing how the purposive , decision-making role of particular women and their families . . . illuminates the ways in which societal , familial , and individual forces converge to condition the choices women make concerning employment . " The Context as Thesis The first element ( Figure 6.1 ) is called the context , and in Hegelian terms it may be thought of as thesis . That is , the context represents the relatively more or less constant elements both of the broader situation and of the persons who constitute it . // CLUSTERS OF CONTEXT VARIABLES Economic/ occupational variables consist not only of measures of both partners ' education , occupational status and income ( if currently employed ) , they also include assessments of satisfactions with current life-style , including their partners ' ( if any ) contribution to it . Equally significant are measures of current occupational achievement and aspirations and expectations for future achievement . Compositional issues consider legal and residential status , including , of course , whether a household has one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a relationship with Other residing in a separate household in the same or different locale ? A separate question is whether Actor has a primary relationship with an Other that may be described merely as either propinquitous or as a friendship ( not sexual ) because , for example , Other contributes to child support and/or has child visitation and/or custody rights ? Composition also subsumes numbers and ages of children in the household , including whether they are his , hers , or theirs . Length of relationship can be measured from at least four different times : since first meeting , since becoming sexually involved , since coresidence ( if it has occurred ) , since legalization ( if at all ) . The socioemotional or expressive dimension consists of at least three interrelated and multifaceted components : satisfactions with companionship activities during nonpaid working hours , sexual satisfaction , and satisfactions with emotional intimacy including love/caring , and feelings about Other . The religious devoutness dimension pertains to degree of Actor 's religiousness as assessed by indicators relevant to the contemporary U.S. religious scene ( Connecticut Mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired interchangeability between the genders and are a major component in accounting for variations in decision-making dynamics throughout contemporary primary relationships ( Scanzoni and Szinovacz , 1980 ) . Variation in these preferences also help explain differences in process behaviors such as bargaining modes ( Arnett , 1987 ) . Individualism pertains to the continuum along which persons may tend to favor relationship maintenance at the expense of their own interests , or their own interests at the potential expense of relationship maintenance . // While individualism , like gender-role preferences , is a generalized orientation , commitment to one 's current partner is highly specific and refers to degree of perseverance in Actor 's relationship with Other . According to Fleck ( 1985 ) , women 's satisfactions with partner 's performance of routine household chores as well as participation in child care are becoming increasingly important dimensions of the contemporary close relationship . Also growing increasingly significant in terms of potential impact on decision-making processes is Actor 's sense of autonomy or self , whether this is conceptualized as self-esteem ( Hill and Scanzoni , 1982 ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in spouse , or in fate ( Scanzoni and Arnett , 1987 ) . Actor 's evaluations of prior decision-making processes and outcomes also constitute a crucial context dimension . If those evaluations tend to be negative their influences on current decision making are likely to be different than if those evaluations have been positive . Just as Actor 's own economic resources may be considered as alternatives to those provided by Other , Actor may also possess Significant Others who may be considered as alternatives . Kin ( including children ) , friends , coworkers , counselors , and so forth , may provide sources of nonerotic primary type gratifications . In addition , Actor may be obtaining sexual gratifications from persons besides Other . The notion of alternatives has long played a role in our understanding of decision-making behaviors ( Thibaut and Kelley , 1959 ) . History The context as thesis also includes socialization experiences in one 's family of orientation , as well as any adult resocialization experiences . Racial , ethnic , kinship , rural/ urban residence , and regional factors also fit here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to Actor 's experiences over time moving in and about Figures 5.1 and 5.2 . It subsumes numbers of divorces and legal marriages , but goes far beyond them to include the full range of sexually based close relationships that tend to shape one 's current relationship ( if any ) . CONTEXTUAL LINKS TO SITUATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Context variables may be said to influence situational development ( Figure 6.1 ) . Chapter 5 showed that establishment of a significant sexual exchange indicates that the pair are indeed in a formation phase . We also learned that the accumulation of additional exchanges or context // 1 variables contributes to movement into a maintenance/change phase . And degree of love/caring , aspirations for oneself , level of individualism , and so forth , influence commitment levels that can affect all three phases ? formation , M/ C , and dissolution . CONTEXT AS BRIDGE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENT AND SITUATION As Figure 6.1 suggests , the context represents the space in which the environment links up with the situation . Careful consideration of the broad range of variables just described reveals that the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . Economic , cultural , kin , demographic , and other sorts of factors are out there but also within and between the actors . As a bridge the context functions as a conduit whereby the environment , as filtered through the partners , affects their decision making over specific matters , such as occupational behaviors , money , and so forth . THE CONTEXT AS DYNAMIC However , identifying the context as a space tends toward an overly static image that is not in keeping with our overall notions of dynamics . While the context as thesis may be conceived of as relatively constant , it is in fact a restless constancy . To a greater or lesser degree the context is , as Simmel argues , actively seeking to break out of its constancy . This restlessness is owing chiefly to the dialectics inherent between women and men described in Chapter 3 . Although perhaps muted at certain points in time these dialectics perennially maintain potential for eruption into active clashes , that is , into antitheses . Decision-Making Processes as Antitheses Knorr-Cetina ( 1981 : 18 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " interlocking turn-taking ? mutually contingent feedback responses to one another . " Buckley ( 1967 : 146 ) observes that Turner ( 1962 ) coined the term role making to be synonymous with decision making , namely , " a tentative process of reciprocal responding of self and other . . . challenging or reinforcing one 's conception of the role of the other , and consequently stabilizing or modifying one 's own role as a product of this essentially feedback testing transaction . " Hicks et al . ( 1983 : 174 ) speak of " the term black box . . . borrowed from communication theory . . . that refers to the mysterious , unseen area // within which input is transformed into output . " That black box has recently been the focus of a number of investigations ( Strauss , 1978 ; Gulliver , 1979 ; Zartman , 1978 ; Walcott et al. , 1977 ; Morley and Stephenson , 1977 ; Blalock and Wilken , 1979 ; Gottman , 1979 ; Scanzoni and Szinovacz , 1980 ; Hill and Scanzoni , 1982 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , elements from the milieu , mediated by the context , are actually processed by the pair . How do the partners , given the context in which they are enmeshed , act and react with one another so as to organize their activities and interests ? Irrespective of sexual preference or legal status the reality is that many persons in contemporary sexually based situations are to a greater or lesser degree in what might be called a dialectic mode , which is , of course , precisely what one predicts from a process theory perspective . By dialectic mode we mean the dynamics of acting and reacting toward each other ( the processes of antithesis ) so as to be constantly creating fresh syntheses , or what we call outcomes , which are discussed next . To be sure , the dialectic mode is itself a continuum along which couples fall at different times . Where they fall is determined largely by their current context , as influenced by their environment . For example , the very essence of the equal partner arrangement described in Chapter 4 is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of orientations displayed in Table 4.2 , we may expect a high level of acting/ reacting over wide ranges of activities/ interests . But if one polar end of this continuum is labeled dialectic mode , then the other polar end is labeled the normative mode . Thus holding to the sorts of orientations displayed in Table 4.1 shifts HC and JSP partners along this continuum toward that normative mode . Relationships characterized by those partnership forms may tend to experience lower levels of dialectics , and thus the creation of fewer fresh syntheses . The orientations expressed by Table 4.1 are relatively concrete , specific , and unambiguous . Hence , one could surmise that the range of legitimate decision-making options open to partners holding these orientations tends to be comparatively limited . Since EP arrangements are more likely to be characterized by the norms inherent in Table 4.2 , a major distinguishing operational feature of EP is the mode of decision-making dynamics . Asserting that proposition in no way denigrates the significance of the EP partners ' having comparable occupational commitments . Instead , what the proposition does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any given situation , its effects are mediated via ongoing processes . Knowing that both persons are highly occupationally involved and that they adhere to the sorts of norms displayed in Table // 4.2 , are the first necessary steps in identifying a couple as EP . What then becomes sufficient is information regarding their decision-making dynamics . Furthermore , the dynamic character of these decision-making processes is underscored by the reality that males and females may hold to differing sets of norms . Many legal marriages commence with both partners holding more or less strongly to Table 4.1 orientations . Over time one or both partners may shift gradually in the direction of one or more of the orientations displayed in Table 4.2 . If the partners ' shifts are not comparable , then these basic value cleavages may make mutually satisfactory negotiation processes extremely difficult to achieve . For example , if the woman is beginning to adhere strongly to point 3 in Table 4.2 ? role interchangeability ? but he still holds to some form of points 1 and 2 in Table 4.1 ? role specialization , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . In that same vein , recall that adherence to the norms displayed by Table 4.2 is associated with measures of increased individualism and of reduced religious devoutness . Hence , if either partner gradually becomes less devout and also more individualistic , thus triggering shifts on his or her part toward Table 4.1 orientations , and at the same time Other remains more devout and less individualistic , then negotiations become even more complex and perhaps intractable ( Scanzoni , 1979b ) . In short regardless of where partners currently fall on any of these context dimensions , one or both persons may later move a notch or two in terms of aspirations , expectations , preferences , and satisfactions . Consequently , the dialectics of acting/ reacting may be triggered , that is , the black box . An antithesis has been established , and is in motion . By way of analogy one might conceive of the environment and the context as the heat and the crucible respectively . One can vary the temperature , volume , material , and so on , of the crucible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crucible may , as a result of those variations , remix to form something different than existed previously . Similarly , triggering the decision-making dialectics within SBPR is analogous to elements within a crucible being agitated and remixed . But why are the dialectics so difficult to research ? Why is the antithesis so puzzling to conceptualize and measure ? Identifying some ( not all ) of the more crucial elements relevant to a dialectic mode generates the following list : // ( 2 ) And while listing them in this fashion appears fairly straightforward , accounting for how they interact in empirical reality is much more ambiguous and open to extensive and intensive research . First off , note that the first three dimensions listed ( the matter ; love/caring ; commitment ) are actually from the context , or thesis , and thus are not strictly speaking part of the antithesis , or process dynamics . But we are compelled to identify them in order to traverse the bridge into those dynamics . For instance , if one begins with the matter itself , the investigator must determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or is it merely symbolic of some other more profound discontent ? And in either case , is it connected to other matters ? If the wife wishes to get her husband to allow her to take a paying job , must she also negotiate with him over his taking more responsibility for child care ? And is the matter being manifested explicitly or implicitly , or is it expressed in both silent and overt ways over time ? Next , how strongly do the partners actually love each other ? How deeply do they feel and care about one another ? And what are the levels of rewards/ costs , and the levels of individualism that influence level of commitment ? Next , how much commitment exists , or does not exist ? Does the commitment stem chiefly from extrinsic rewards , or from intrinsic gratifications ? Or from a blend of both ? What perceived constraints , duties , and obligations are operative ? What alternatives in the form of others and/ or economic opportunities do or do not exist ? Many additional context variables could be introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relevant variables , one is then ready to consider some of the decision-making elements themselves . ' For example , communication style ( D ) refers to verbal and nonverbal ways of behaving toward each other during periods of decision making . // Raush et al . ( 1974 ) identify six broad categories of styles ? each one subsuming several additional subelements . The first of these is called cognitive acts and involves suggestions and rational arguments . Second is resolving acts ? aimed at cooling the conflict or resolving the conflict issue . Third is reconciling acts ? aimed at reconciling the two partners emotionally . Fourth is appealing acts ? aimed at beseeching Other to grant one 's wish . Fifth is rejecting acts ? revealing a cold or nasty rejection of the partner 's argument or person . Sixth is coercive acts/ personal attacks ? aimed at forcing compliance through power plays , guilt induction , or disparagement of Other . Presumably , levels of love and caring , and levels of commitment affect these varied communication styles . To be high on love and commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the first three just described . To have less love and commitment is more likely to generate the latter three negative types of communication styles . Likewise , degree of love and commitment is likely to be associated with what are called gaming patterns . We make a qualitative and sharp distinction between the terms gaming and game . In the literature games and game theory , whether deservedly or not , have been associated with win/ lose outcomes . Gaming by way of contrast , is a newly emerging cross-disciplinary emphasis in which the prime focus is researching how parties are dealing with each other so that all parties can win or profit ( Raser , 1969 ) . The essence of gaming is contained in point 1 of Table 4.2 ? there are no inherently fixed rules except the rule that there are none . Rules may be made up as the partners go along ? depending on what works for them , or does not work . Within relationships , of course , gaming and game exist on a continuum . The five cited indicators reveal whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion . First , are the partners cooperative ( gaming ) or inflexible ( game ) ? Second , do they generate innovative ways to try to deal with the matter , or do they insist on established ways ? To be innovative is to be gaming ; to insist on what has been is to game . Third , how much do they trust each other ? To what degree does each consider Other to be equitable or not ? To what degree do they resent or feel hostile toward each other ? Gaming behaviors are probably more likely to produce a sense of trust , equity , and increased feelings of warmth , love , caring , and affection . But to behave in gamelike fashion is likely to produce precisely the opposite state of affairs . Fourth , do they perceive each other to be oriented toward individual or toward joint or mutual profit ? Gaming would seem to foster mutuality ; to be gamelike is much less likely to do so . Fifth , do they use their resources to try to achieve symmetrical power that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they marshal their resources to impose a degree of asymmetrical power that Other considers nonlegitimate ? Gaming is obviously more oriented toward symmetrical and legitimate power . Moreover , recall that the mode of decision making in and of itself can be given and taken by actors as a gift  --  as a symbol of commitment to one another qua persons . Thus the paradox is that while persons may be negotiating over extrinsic matters about which one or both may sense inequities , if the mode of their decision making is gaminglike it may nonetheless be perceived as an exchange of intrinsic gratifications , thus enhancing their mutual commitment . Over time , presumably , that gratification would likely be correlated with resolutions of the extrinsic issue tending to be mutually satisfactory . Consequently , as Actor and Other act and react toward each other over time in a dialectic mode , that is , as they are engaged in antithesis , and these five sets of process factors mix and blend , the inevitable result is change ( a fresh synthesis ) of some sort . As detailed next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either the matter(s) has ( have ) been altered , and/or the person 's own orientations/behaviors have been altered . LINKS TO SITUATIONAL DEVELOPMENT As noted in Figure 6.1 , and in Chapter 5 , these all-important decision-making processes are said to have significant influences on the development of relationships . Communication styles , gaming patterns , and bargaining mode ( Pruitt , 1981 ) contribute to movement within or across developmental phases . In effect , the fashion in which persons actually do their decision-making dynamics ( e.g. , gamelike or gaming ) because of its intrinsic implications and impact on commitment is said to influence situational development at least as much as the actual substantive or extrinsic arrangements connected with the particular matter , for example , whether a wife enters the paid labor force or not . Outcomes as Syntheses Arguing as we just did that change of some sort inevitably results from the dialectics of mixing and blending requires that we specify the nature of these changes more precisely . While the pair is actually making decisions ( whether verbal or nonverbal ) , the several relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antithesis is occurring . The result is a fresh synthesis that will over time become a new context . That context is a new thesis probably soon to be challenged // by a subsequent antithesis . The outcomes consist of potential alterations in one or more of the clusters of context variables . Alterations ( or their absence ) in terms of behaviors are the simplest to observe . For instance , let us say the woman wishes to take paid employment and thus shift from complement to junior-partner . She negotiates with her husband , and he either refuses or agrees to allow her to do so . If he disallows it , there is no apparent change in her work behavior or in their partnership pattern . They remain HC instead of shifting to JSP . But if she does enter the paid work force , it is a straightforward observable change in her behavior as well as a change in their partnership patterns . However , the assumption is that regardless of the behavioral outcome , that is , shift or no shift in the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' own subjective orientations . For example , if he refuses to allow her to work , it may reduce the woman 's sense that he is fair toward her and also increase her feelings that he is interested in his well-being but not in hers or theirs jointly . Her resentment toward him may increase as well , and she may feel he is exercising nonlegitimate power over her . Thus her level of love/ caring may decline accordingly . Her sense of intrinsic gratification diminishes alongside the denial of desired extrinsic rewards . On the other hand , he may reluctantly accede to her employment , but because of it , resent her more than before and define her more strongly than before as being concerned with her own interests , but not with his or theirs . Or it is possible that behavioral changes/ nonchanges of whatever sort may be accompanied by increases in positive feelings toward Other by both actors ? an increased sense of fairness , stronger feelings of love/caring , and thus an enhancement of the intrinsic bases of their commitment . The point being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both objective and subjective in character . And as such , these outcomes become the newly altered context for subsequent decision-making processes over that very same matter or over any other matter . Consequently commitment is not only influenced by decisionmaking processes ; over time it becomes a context variable that affects how persons behave during their subsequent decision-making ( Kelley , 1983 ) . Then , in continuing feed-forward fashion , the character of those latter processes influence the degree of commitment . From a developmental perspective , the level of commitment within a fresh synthesis is affected by the character of the preceding antithesis . If the decisionmaking processes within the prior antithesis have been positive in terms of communication style and gaming patterns , and if the outcomes have been satisfactory , both objectively and subjectively , commitment is // likely to be enhanced and increased . Conversely , negative decisionmaking processes and unsatisfactory outcomes are likely to undermine commitment levels . The same type of reasoning applies to all of the remaining clusters of context variables . They may be altered via decision-making processes so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were during the prior thesis . And as the synthesis evolves into a fresh thesis those variables function as important influences on subsequent decisionmaking processes . For example , if increases or decreases in income levels are an outcome , that income variable becomes part of a fresh context that affects later decision-making processes . Likewise , genderrole modernity may be changed by ongoing decision-making experiences , and later alter both decision-making experiences and the character of the couple 's relationship . In one study ( Scanzoni , 1978 : 18-19 ) , wives reinterviewed after a four-year interval reported that their levels of gender-role modernity had increased significantly . Many factors ( including environmental ) accounted for this type of adult resocialization , but one factor appeared to be the accumulated experiences of having to negotiate with their husbands regarding their desired entry into the paid labor force . These repeated decision-making episodes contributed over time to the increased gender-role modernity of wives in the sample . LINKS TO DEVELOPMENTAL PHASES And just as Figure 6.1 indicates that context and process dynamics influence situational development , outcome dimensions ( objective/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is very likely a strong association between the sorts of influences gaming patterns and communication styles have on development and the kinds of influences objective/ subjective outcomes have on development . We learned that positive communication styles and genuine gaming patterns tend to result in outcomes consisting of mutually satisfactory behavioral changes alongside positive feelings toward and evaluations of Other . And we also learned that positive communication styles and gaming patterns tend to enhance the M/ C phase of development . Therefore , it is likely that outcomes consisting of mutually satisfactory behavioral changes and positive feelings toward Other are likely to enhance development in comparable fashion . In short , the mode of the antithesis and the character of the synthesis are associated with each other , and in turn influence the pair 's // development in similar ways . In the case of the husband and wife negotiating her paid employment , it could be argued that if one or both partners use gamelike behaviors and negative communication styles to generate a behavioral outcome that Other opposes ( she takes a job although he does not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires it ) , then a concomitant outcome will be feelings of resentment by one or perhaps both partners . Both of those particular sets of outcomes ? behaviors and feelings ? could have negative affects on commitment levels that in turn influence ongoing situational development . If the couple is in an M/ C phase , it is possible that they will continue in that phase . On the other hand , if additional gratifications are few and costs high , this new synthesis regarding her employment could edge them toward or perhaps even into a dissolution phase . Conversely , a fresh synthesis consisting of mutually satisfactory behaviors and enhanced feelings that Other is concerned for joint wellbeing is likely to increase commitment levels . Indeed , had the couple been in a dissolution phase , it is logically possible for this fresh synthesis to edge them onto an M/C phase . The Sexually Based Situation Affects Its Environment Earlier we indicated that this chapter is about the possibilities of human agency . SBPR is not totally determined or constrained by its environment . Its environment may also enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative ways . Moreover , it follows that to some researchable degree the developing situation modifies its environment in one fashion or another.2 Consequently , Figure 6.1 shows a direct arrow from the situation to the environment . The latter has flowed into the sexually bonded situation as Figure 6.1 indicates ; and Mows out as well . And once having passed through the situation , it may not be the same as it was . AGGREGATION AND DEMOGRAPHICS One way to conceptualize this sort of feed-forward influence between the micro situation and its macro milieu is via the " aggregation hypothesis , " which " says that environmental phenomena are made up of aggregations and repetitions of many similar micro episodes " ( KnorrCetina , 1981 : 25-26 ) . For instance , each couple divorcing at the micro level is counted with other divorcing couples , the result being a collective figure for any given year that , when compared with previous years ' // aggregated figures , enables the demographer to describe environmental trends in divorce rates . The same type of reasoning would apply to the micro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first marriage , cohabitation , single-parent households , prevalence of adolescent sexuality , fertility control patterns , and so forth . As Moen ( 1985 : 116 ) reasons : " many individuals making private decisions . . . result in major social events . " This particular means of describing micro-level feedbacks on environmental features ? counting micro-level behaviors and , when they are extensive and frequent enough , asserting that they have become pervasive societywide patterns ? is the most readily presentable and most easily and intuitively understood among the several ways of identifying micro feedback effects . For instance , in the course of being in a dissolution phase , if the partners physically separate , it is quantifiable . If they subsequently divorce , it is also countable . Likewise , all of the behavioral arrangements displayed in Figures 5.1 and 5.2 can also be counted and , for instance , trends reported regarding cohabitation with or without children present , legal remarriages without or with his , her , or their children , and so on . It would be more difficult to calculate nonlegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of multiple partnerships , but it would certainly be possible . To do so would mean , however , that the researcher would have to work from assumptions inherent in shifting to a higher-order construct ? SBPR ? instead of focusing on the primacy of the conventional model . Indeed , the more attention is paid to this sort of abstract conceptualization , the greater the implications for alterations in what has been known as the field of family demography ( Teachman et al. , 1987 ) . Inevitable changes in constructs , concepts , and variables pertaining to micro-level phenomena are likely to mean alterations in certain macro-level conceptualizations and measures . In any case , the impact of the sexually based situation on its environment , as far as current demographic patterns are concerned , is manifested in terms of the specific and concrete behavioral arrangements that are subsumed by SBPR . Simultaneously , these arrangements ( e.g. , wife in paid labor force or not ) are influenced by the sorts of decisionmaking patterns and processes just described that are affected by context as well as by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize that the situation 's effect on its milieu can emerge from the M/C phase as well as the dissolution phase . That is , couples in either phase can be living together or not , or be legal or not , or have children present or not , or have both partners in the paid labor force or not , and so on . Thus the situation 's effect on its environment occurs not merely // through its dissolution phase , although it is probably in that phase that couples could be most readily identified as , say , divorced or not . CULTURAL MODELING Given the relatively transitory character of the formation phase , it is more difficult to determine just what effects it might have on demographic patterns . Instead , it is more likely that the impact of the formation phase on its environment is more in terms of what Figure 6.1 identifies as cultural modeling . The M/ C and dissolution phases would also , of course , have a modeling impact , in addition to their demographic impact . Even Chafetz ( 1984 : 121 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allows that as " new behavior patterns , are constantly being generated " at the micro level , some of these " become part of the prevailing culture and social structure " because they are " rewarded by others in their environment owing to their success in dealing with their environment . Others perceive this reward process and imitate the behavior until , gradually , it becomes an accepted mode of behavior , that is , part of the general culture and social structure . " A classic example of feed forward over time between micro situations and macro-level culture norms/behaviors can be found in the recent history of sexuality in the United States ( Gergen , 1973 ; Byrne , 1977 ; Gagnon , 1975 ; Robinson , 1976 ; Ehrenreich et al. , 1986 ) . Although there is no precise beginning point when tracing ongoing micro/ macro feedbacks , for the sake of argument , let us begin with Kinsey and his colleagues gathering micro-level information on Americans ' sexual activities in the 1930s and 1940s . The data were then aggregated and , as reported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that what had been thought to be deviant sexual behavior ( especially premarital ) in the United States was far greater in size , scope , and scale than had ever been imagined by most ordinary citizens . Over time , the environment ( i.e. , widespread media dissemination of the Kinsey findings ) fed forward onto increasing numbers of sexually bonded situations enabling actors in them to hold , model , or imitate those findings , and thus to maintain norms and to behave in ways regarding sex that approximated what had previously been thought of as deviant patterns . Outcomes from those micro situations fed forward in turn onto the broader environment ? aggregated demographic patterns revealing ongoing increases in persons ' sexual activity continued to be widely disseminated : films , TV , and other popular culture vehicles conveyed an // image of greater flexibility than before in ordinary persons ' norms/ behaviors regarding sexuality . Over time , those demographic and cultural patterns ( the result of prior micro situations ) fed forward again onto increasing numbers of sexually based or bonded situations , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviors regarding nonmarital sexuality are substantially different from what they were when Kinsey began his research five decades ago ( Francoeur , 1987 ) . The result is that what was once deviant behavior has now become part of the accepted array of sexual norms and behaviors within the larger society . Both the nature of sexual situations and the demographic/cultural environment have changed dramatically with regard to sexuality . But it can not be said that the one determined the other . Both have fed forward onto each other over time . The significance of the modeling effects of emerging micro-level behaviors ( women 's employment , divorce stemming from individualistic rationales , cohabitation , single parenthood , separate residences in same or different locales , blended households , and so on ) , on prevailing cultural or macro-level norms can not be overestimated . Recall that Chapters 1 and 2 reported findings from several surveys indicating three broad categories in the United States regarding cultural norms pertaining to sex , marriage , families , and close relationships . At one end of this continuum , approximately a fifth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end , approximately a fifth adheres to progressive norms . But the broad center of the population consists of a majority in drift ( Scanzoni , 1983 ) . That is , in terms of explicitly stated norms , they tend to favor the conservative mode . Nonetheless , in terms of their actual behaviors , they are tending to drift in unceremonious fashion toward the progressive mode . As Chafetz ( 1984 : 121 ) describes it , they are drifting because they observe in others around them certain novel patterns that work , that is , are rewarded and rewarding and that enable them to deal more successfully with their environment . Decreasing numbers of persons are actually behaving in terms of the benchmark paradigm . And as increasing numbers behave in accordance with a more complicated image ? as in Figures 5.1 and 5.2 , their behavior influences others not only to begin to behave accordingly but also to begin to hold norms actually legitimating their behaviors . Thus the sexually developing relationship/ situation influences and helps to transform its own cultural environment . Over time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative ways , resulting in further transformation of the prevailing culture , and so on . // We have noted repeatedly that one of the most crucial underpinnings of this gradually ongoing cultural modification is the redefinition of love in therapeutic terms , rather than in terms of obligation ( Bellah et al. , 1985 ) . The prevailing folkways enunciated by establishment institutions ( conservative churches , schools , government , certain segments of the human services community , and so on ) tend to be couched primarily in love as obligation terms . Nevertheless , it seems apparent that increasing numbers of relationships are becoming characterized by love as therapy . As this micro-level shift occurs it evidently tends to influence macro cultural norms existing in the environment regarding the desirability of redefining love . Certain aspects of the media as part of the environment , for example , films , live drama , and literature , not only model less conventional approaches to love , they describe the struggles inherent in seeking to establish commitment within the contemporary relationship , given the individualism that has become integral to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of legitimating certain specific behaviors , contemporary relationships are also beginning to influence cultural redefinitions of love , individualism , and commitment . Summary The sexually based primary relationship consists not only of the sets of ongoing patterns described in Figures 5.1 and 5.2 , it also rests on the dynamics inherent in Figure 6.1 . Based on theoretical assumptions laid out in Chapter 3 , it is argued that the contemporary relationship is not merely constrained by its milieu , it is also enabled . Moreover , as it is enabled , it tends to transform its milieu ? especially in demographic and cultural terms . The existing milieu is funneled into the micro situation via its context , consisting of an array of behavioral , subjective , and resource-type dimensions . The context may be thought of as a kind of thesis ? representing relative constancy . However , the dialectics intrinsic to relationships between the sexes may spawn the desire for some sort of behavioral alteration pertaining to one or more of the pair 's shared interdependencies . Thus process dynamics ( an antithesis ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication styles , and variations in gamelike ( win/ lose ) versus gaming ( win/ win ) behaviors . The result is an outcome , or synthesis , consisting of changes from the former thesis in one of several subjective and/or objective dimensions . As they are occurring , these ongoing dialectics also influence phases of the situation 's development . As a result of those // dialectics , and subsumed within that development , are behavioral arrangements such as those displayed in Figures 5.1 and 5.2 . Thus the situation gives rise to arrangements that , when aggregated , influence demographic trends existing within its larger environment . Concomitantly , the romantic situation taken as a whole , including its underlying individualistic assumptions , tends to model innovative norms that influence the larger cultural milieu . Thus a higher-order construct such as SBPR , unlike the conventional paradigm that establishes the primacy of a fixed benchmark regardless of environmental forces , assumes the existence of relationships that are both influenced by and also significantly influence their milieu . The flexibility of contemporary situations enables them to incorporate certain desirable ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . And while some situations may be constrained in an undesirable fashion , that is by no means a universal or inevitable state of affairs . Indeed , it has been argued that the greater the adherence to the benchmark pattern , the greater the difficulties of adequate close relationship functioning within contemporary society . Furthermore , those innovative responses to the environment ( made possible by the situation 's flexibility ) , owing to their very novelty , simultaneously tend to change the environment both in its demographic and cultural aspects . // INFLUENCES AMONG DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS , CHILDREN , AND ADULTS The best statistical predictions indicate that an increasing number of parents and children are going to go through a series of transitions and reorganizations in family ties and household structure Hetherington , Cox , and Cox 1982 : 285 . Quite possibly the most serious oversight in the literature on social development is the absence of information concerning the interdependencies existing between experiences in one social world and experiences in others Hartup , 1979 : 949 . As young children grow older . . . both parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between attachment and separation and between control and independence . . . . As children grow . . . even into adulthood , the social worlds of the children and of their parents continue to affect each other Rubin and Sloman , 1984 : 248-249 . Developmental psychologists have long focused on changes in children as they mature from birth through late adolescence . According to Ambert ( 1986 ) , sociologists have paid less attention to children for numerous reasons , not least of which is the absence of any general sociological approaches pertaining to developmental changes over time . Moreover , when children 's development has been researched the issue has been parental influences on the child ( Lewis , 1984 ) . Much less researched are the sorts of influences the child may have on parents . Even less examined are the ongoing feedback effects the generations may have on each other from birth throughout old age ( Lerner and Spanier , 1978 ) . Child/Parent Feedback But in addressing child/ parent influences over time , we are faced with the emerging complications that the contemporary contexts within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other are being continually reshuffled . It is difficult enough to try to study child/ parent feed-forward influences when there exists a relatively high degree of constancy ? as was the case during the past in white society , though not in black society . However , it is quite another thing to investigate feedbacks within contexts that are fluid , often as a result of those ongoing feedbacks themselves . As Belsky et al . ( 1984 : vi ) observe , the development of contemporary children can not be adequately understood apart from careful attention to " high levels of divorce , maternal employment , and so forth . " In criticizing " previous studies that have purported to estimate children 's experience with only one parent , " Hofferth ( 1985b : 93 ) concludes that they have " not obtained representative samples of children or adequately measured their experiences ; they have focused primarily on children living with mothers who have been married , and they have focused primarily on children 's experience of parental divorce and separation . This very traditional view of family formation belies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1985b ) goes on to cite two demographic trends that when taken into account greatly enlarge the proportions of children known to reside in other than conventional family forms . One " is the increase in the proportion of children who are born out-of-wedlock " ( p. 93 ) . She reports ( p. 93 ) that among whites , that figure almost doubled from 1970 to 1980 ( 6% to 11% ) ; and among blacks , it increased almost by half ( 38% to 55% ) . These nonlegal mothers and their children could be located at numerous points throughout Figures 5.1 and 5.2 . For example , these particular adults may be in the upper right segment of Figure 5.1 ? no sexually based or bonded adult situation , though obviously in a nonromantic primary relationship with the child . Or at the child 's birth , these particular mothers may in fact be in a romantic situation as expressed by varied permutations of Figures 5.1 or 5.2 . If located in Figure 5.1 , she is of course not coresiding or in any sort of partnership ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or dissolution phases . If she is in Figure 5.2 , she may or may not be coresiding ? she has some form of partnership and she may be in either the M/C or dissolution phases . Furthermore , the mother in a nonsexually based situation at the child 's birth may develop one sometime shortly after the birth . And those having had romantic situations around the time of the birth may experience changes in their varied expressions ? for example , nonlegal to legal , nonshared to shared household ( or vice versa ) , and so forth . The point being that regardless // of living arrangements at the time of birth of the " nonlegal " child , given additional time the mother often tends to experience developmental changes in her relationships ( to say nothing about her own individual development ) alongside the infant 's development . Those having had no romantic situation may enter one . Those having had one may experience numerous shifts in the living arrangements that express it . And both entry and shifts by adults are simultaneously experienced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hofferth 's second trend ? increases in adult cohabitation  --  which , as we just saw , cross-cuts the first , also reinforces that same dynamic image conveyed by Figures 5.1 and 5.2 . Although the proportion of " adults cohabiting at any one time is still small . . . the number who have ever cohabited is much larger , and a substantial number . . . live with their own children . . . . Thus it can be expected that an increasing proportion of children will experience parental cohabitation " ( Hofferth , 1985b : 94 ) . Hofferth observes ( p. 94 ) that this second " trend probably reduces somewhat the length of time children spend with only one parent . " The significant point is that , first , when we add the children of ever-married women who have later been separated , divorced , remarried , to the children of the never-married , and second , we acknowledge Hofferth 's ( 1985b : 113 ) conclusion that " there is a substantial amount of movement among family types ; much more so than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes strikingly apparent how inadequate the conventional family paradigm actually is . Something akin to Figures 5.1 and 5.2 is requisite to capture the ongoing influences between relationship development and individual development as the lives of adults and children impinge upon one another over time . In general , over the past decade it has become clear that families are less and less amenable to simple description in terms of legal marital status ; more and more effort is required to capture de facto living arrangements and interactions that make up family life in a modern industrial nation ( Hofferth , 1985b : 94 ) . Hofferth ( 1985b ) concludes her report by stating that currently , " black-white differences are enormous " ( p. 114 ) . However , " cohort change has been substantial and rapid . Recent birth cohorts white as well as black differ greatly . It is difficult to imagine the future family experiences of recent birth cohorts " ( p. 114 ) . She points out that // children " born to two natural parents , both married once , spend a much smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child born into any other arrangement " ( p. 114 ) . But given that those precise empirical parental conditions are occurring less and less often in both white and black society , it would appear that the trend is in the direction of increasing numbers of children spending ever more time in other than legal dual birth parent arrangements . Significantly , evidence for that same sort of trend appears in a recent report on children 's living arrangements in New Zealand ( Fergusson et al. , 1985 ) . BALANCING CHILD/ADULT INTERESTS And it turns out that a number of researchers from a variety of disciplines have already begun to explore the dynamics of parent-child feed forward over time from birth through aging taking these sorts of altered adult situations into account ( Lerner and Spanier , 1978 ; Worrell , 1981 ; Belsky et al. , 1984 ; Lamb , 1978 , 1982 ; Lewis , 1984 ; Bengston and Troll , 1978 ; Hess and Waring , 1978 ) . In their crosscultural analyses of recent trends in parenting , Rapoport et al . ( 1977 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional family paradigm was the notion that children are rather fragile , passive , and defenseless ( p. 10 ) . Consequently , it follows that children can " do little to " parents ; however parents can " do much to " children . Nonetheless , parents ' awesome responsibility within that paradigm was tempered by the belief " that when it is a question of deciding between the rights , wishes and welfare of parents and those of children , the well-being of the child must be the decisive factor " ( p. 10 ; Blustein , 1982 ) . And since the paradigm inherently assumed that children 's welfare was best served by heavy maternal involvement during their early years , Rapoport et al . ( 1977 : 11 ) use the label " child-centered , mother-focused paradigm for parenting . " However , in view of the sorts of empirical realities just cited , Rapoport et al . ( p. 11 ) contend that the conventional paradigm 's conceptions of parent-child interaction are consequently " sorely in need of revision . The conditions that made the paradigm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions presumably underlying many of these empirical changes is the greater pervasiveness of adult individualism discussed in prior chapters . Not that the growth of individualism requires that one partner 's interests be subordinated to those of the other partner ( Scanzoni , 1978 : 116-117 ) , or that children 's // interests be subordinated to those of adults . Instead say Rapoport et al . ( p. 14 ) , " a new conception . . . assumes an appreciation of how parents ' preoccupations , needs and requirements can be reconciled with those of children . " But in order to explore this sort of reconciliation seriously , one must abandon the notion of passive children , doing virtually nothing to adults . Instead a fresh research paradigm examines " children 's strengths as well as their vulnerabilities , " concomitant with consideration of " parents ' vulnerabilities as well as their strengths " ( Rapoport et al. , 1977 : 14-15 ) . The reward-seeking premise applied earlier to adult relationships is now applied to parent/ child nonromantic close relations except that the degree of voluntarism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preteens . Moreover , the range of expectations surrounding shared interdependencies between parents and children is different than it is between adults . By definition , the most notable difference is the sexual dimension . And in spite of recent investigations uncovering evidence ? both historical and contemporary ? of considerable parental and sib violations of the incest taboo , it makes most theoretical sense , for the time being , to maintain the distinction between legitimate and nonlegitimate erotic situations , while always allowing for empirical investigations of the causes and consequences of violations of the incest taboo ? both parent/child and sib . Virtually all of the theoretical assumptions applied earlier to sexually based situations may also be applied to nonromantic parent/ child situations . Children may be thought of as reward-seeking creatures , using whatever strengths or resources are available to them to maximize benefits and reduce costs . " Ideally , the needs reward seeking of the child , of the parents , and of the mate mutually reinforce one another . Practically , however , these needs reward seeking are to varying degrees in opposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapoport et al. , 1977 : 16 ) . Four Forms of Development These various sources of reward seeking ( and giving ) underscore the point that a comprehensive image of families must be constructed out of the feed forward among four kinds of development : individual adult , individual child , adult relationship , and child/ parent relationship . " Often the literature appears to assume that the child , encountering his // sic parents ' attitudes as he sic grows and changes , interacts with a fixed quantity ? the adult . Yet parenthood itself is a developmental process . Not only do inner and societal forces effect changes in the parent ; the child too has an influence on the adaptation and personality development of the parents " ( Rapoport et al. , 1977 : 16 ) . Consequently , as adults and adult situations develop over time , developing children concomitantly tend to express their desired cost/ reward ratios over a wide range of interdependencies with adults resulting in feedback changes in adults , and in adult romantic situations , and also in the child/ adult relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations is influenced by the developing child , just as adult individual and situational development simultaneously influence the developing child . " By influencing those who influence them , children are producers ' of their own development " ( Belsky et al. , 1984 : 227 ) . Figure 7.1 seeks to display graphically the complex interrelationships among these four sets of development . It is this sort of model that underscores our earlier argument that the student/practitioner of adult close relationships must be a developmentalist in the same sense that students of children are developmentalists . By the same token , students of children must add several additional dimensions of development to their thinking as well as their research paradigms . Not that any single research design can deal comprehensively with all possible complexities . Some investigators will continue to be relatively more conversant with adult-related issues , other investigators with child-related issues . Nevertheless , in scientific terms , Figure 7.1 communicates the lessening significance of existing arbitrary disciplinary boundaries . Figure 7.1 suggests the broad directions in which research will likely need to proceed in order to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and adults . Moreover from a practical standpoint , Figure 7.1 serves communication and heuristic functions . It suggests complexities to the lay public in which adults and children are in fact enmeshed . Figure 7.1 provides a much more realistic image of the worlds of families than does the conventional nuclear family paradigm . ' As such , it presumably becomes a more useful tool for intervention in people 's lives and relationships . To assume any starting point in Figure 7.1 is totally arbitrary , since over time any one of the dimensions impinges on the other . But say we look first at the developing adult ( A ) . We see that as Actor changes , that // kind of development influences the three remaining elements . For instance , we assume that Actor has an adult Significant Other . Hence Actor 's own change ( or lack of it ) influences the relationship between the adult partners ( SBPR ) . Assuming Actor also has a child ( C ) Actor 's development also influences that child 's development . The child may be biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Actor . The child 's age ( pre- or post-18 ) mediates the impact of actor 's influence as does the nature of the dimension of change in question . Finally actor 's development influences the relationship between him or her self and the child ( CA ) . The influence is direct ( as are the other two influences from A ) as Figure 7.1 shows . At the same times that actor 's development is influencing SBPR , C , and CA , these three dimensions are also changing ? partly in response to Actor but also in response to additional persons and to their environment in general . Consequently , Figure 7.1 reveals simultaneous feed-forward effects from SBPR to A , CA to A , and from C to A. The same types of reasoning would apply if one were to start from any of the three remaining dimensions in Figure 7.1 . For example , the adult relationship influences Actor , also the developing child , and also the child/ adult relationship . As the adult relationship changes , there are likely to be corresponding shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of them ( A , C , CA ) , they , in // turn , influence the sexually based situation . Furthermore , if we began at CA or at C , we would likewise pursue the direct effects of either type of development on the remaining three forms of development . Simultaneously , we would investigate feed-forward effects in all instances . The child/ adult relationship influences and feeds forward with the developing adult , the adult relationship , and with the child . Likewise , the developing child feeds forward with the developing adult , the adult relationship , and with his or her relationship with the adult . At the same times that these direct influences occur , there are numerous indirect effects , as Figure 7.1 indicates . The developing adult influences the child indirectly via his or her adult relationship , and also indirectly through the relationship the adult maintains with the child . Simultaneously , the developing adult relationship indirectly influences Actor via the child , and via the relationship actor maintains with the child . Likewise , the adult-child relationship indirectly influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Finally , the developing child exercises indirect influences on Actor via the adult relationship and via the relationship between the child and Actor . While identifying these numerous complexities , we have not considered the possibilities of an additional child . Nor have we considered the adult Other in conjunction with the child(ren) . Nor have we pondered the consequences of adult multiple relationships . When Davis ( 1972 ) asserts that the family is organizationally simple , he apparently has in mind the conventional structure consisting of the predetermined static roles of husband/wife/child . In contrast , Figure 7.1 , stemming from a very different set of theoretical notions , suggests considerable organizational complexity . Since development is the prime reality throughout the Figure 7.1 model , organization or patterns are always , as Gergen ( 1980 ) suggests , potentially evanescent ? that is , constantly open to possible alterations or modifications . The sorts of demographic trends identified throughout these pages indicate that an image of families akin to Figure 7.1 ? forms of development influencing one another over time ? will become increasingly relevant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , there has not been a great deal of research stemming from these particular developmentalist assumptions . Consequently , drawing on what relevant literature is // available ( e.g. Ahrons and Rodgers , 1987 ) , and based on the theoretical approach described throughout the book , we intend to suggest some research orientations connected with Figure 7.1 . It is plain that Figure 7.1 is intrinsically linked with Figures 5.1 , 5.2 , and 6.1 . Hence , the following proposed research orientations suggest some ways in which the sexually based primary relationship would be investigated , but in conjunction with child-related matters . Expediency often requires the investigator to exclude child considerations ; or children may not be deemed significant to the research problem . The purpose here is not to indicate how the entire Figure 7.1 model would be assessed in one massive research design . Instead , the goal is to indicate how manageable pieces of it could be identified and investigated . One means of suggesting research orientations would be to set forth a series of formal propositions and hypotheses . Since that strategy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of hypothetical case studies from which we occasionally derive propositions . Not only do these case studies orient the researcher toward some of the kinds of research questions that need to be asked in conjunction with Figures 7.1 , 5.1 , 5.2 , and 6.1 , they also serve the additional purpose of illustrating concretely , and thus illuminating , many of the abstract notions suggested throughout the book . Let us assume that we are studying a legally married couple ( first for each ) located in Figure 5.2 , left column , shared household , HC partnership arrangement , MC phase but with no children , and both adults 18 years of age . As Rapoport et al . ( 1977 : 130ff ) point out , " parenting begins before birth , " and in the case of this couple , the matter of children is an interdependence that influenced their romantic situation long before any child was born . In fact , because she became pregnant prior to marriage , it had an influence even prior to that public event . In terms of their ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's formation phase when they were located in the center column of Figure 5.1 . Upon discovering her pregnancy , she introduced ( unexpectedly to him ) that additional shared activity/ interest into their situation . Their resulting communication styles and negotiation patterns over the issue were termed in Chapter 6 as negative , resulting in conflict regulated outcomes ? he wanting an abortion , she wanting the child and also legal marriage . But under pressure from the ticking of her gestational clock , he relented to her objectives . Upon doing so , their situation immediately and necessarily took on a much wider range of shared interdependencies than before , shifting them into // a M/ C phase , although still in center column of Figure 5.1 . Gradually , socioeconomic partnership patterns ( HC ) began to develop between them and they shifted to the upper left column of Figure 5.2 , but in separate households , still in an M/ C phase . Parental pressure kept them from nonlegal cohabiting . At marriage , both their legal status and residence status altered simultaneously to the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very shortly after marriage they experienced childbirth , thus further altering their living arrangements significantly . At this point , the adults may be termed as birth father ( BFa ) and birth mother ( BMo ) . He is employed as an unskilled delivery truck driver ; she is not in the paid labor force . Their birth child may be termed as BC1 . BC1 may be said to have its own primary relationship with BFa and a separate primary relationship with BMo . In their discussion of " the family as a social system , " Feiring and Lewis ( 1984 : 62ff ) not only make a distinction between " parent-parent systems " and " parent-child subsystems , " they also cite the growing literature indicating that infant parent interaction is different when the parent is the father , as compared to when the parent is the mother , or as compared to when all three persons are interacting together . Furthermore , as the child ages , an even stronger case can be made from the literature ( Belsky et al. , 1984 : 93-96 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kind of primary relationship with its father than with its mother . In the case before us , the sex of BC1 has a particularly potent influence on the development of its primary relationship with its BFa , since BC1 is female and BFa strongly holds working-class norms regarding the parenting of an infant daughter . The norms are translated into his generally ignoring it when he is home , and being out with his male buddies as often as possible . Consequently , we may say that the range of activities/ interests shared by BFa and BC ! is more constricted than those shared between BMo and BC1 . Moreover , the character of those activities that may overlap the two sets of child/ adult ( CA ) relationships also seem to be different . In the realm of caregiving , for example , the father may suddenly be interrupted from watching TV by the child 's cries , and respond angrily by scooping up the crib in rough fashion and placing it down in an abrupt manner in the kitchen next to the mother who is cooking supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " all relevant studies point toward one conclusion : that infants have the skills necessary to monitor the behavior of others and the ability to apply the information in modulating , terminating , and initiating interaction with adults . " Over time , the series of " reciprocal interaction sequences " ( Lamb , 1978 : 150 ) // between BFa and BC1 emerges as very different when compared to those between BMo and BC1 . Thus the character of the two developing sets of primary or close relationships between the father and daughter , and mother and daughter , is distinctive . This is the case even though each parent engages in a close relationship with the child that may be characterized as M/ C. To be sure , as numerous analysts indicate ( Feiring and Lewis , 1984 ) , the three relationships ? BFa and BC1 ; BMO and BC1 ; BFa and BMo overlap in numerous ways . In Figure 7.1 , the two child/parent relationships are caught by arrows between A and C ; the adult relationship is caught by arrows between A and SBPR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables that appear in all three relationships , as well as marked similarities in interaction-process patterns . The father , for example , may physically abuse both the mother and the daughter . Thus in terms of Figure 7.1 the basic research question becomes the conditions under which , over time , the development of each of the three relationships in question exercises feedback influences on the two remaining relationships . A most crucial element in the context of the relationships that BC1 has with each parent is , of course , her own biological ( as well as cognitive , emotional , and social ) development . Over time , the more she continues to develop in these myriads of ways , the greater the range of context variables with which each parent is forced to contend ( e.g. , as she begins to crawl , walk , and talk ) and the more complex becomes the actual interaction processes regarding this ever-expanding range of shared activities/interests . In sum , the developing child is engaging in one ongoing , developing situation with her birth mother , and also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . And not only do these two developing relationships feed forward on each other over time , they simultaneously engage in ongoing feed-forward dynamics with the developing sexually based situation existing between the birth parents themselves . Consequently , by focusing on arrays of primary relationships ( Figure 7.1 ) , we provide ourselves a conceptual handle for more validly describing and analyzing situational permutations ( Figures 5.1 and 5.2 ) that may emerge over the life courses of each adult and ( any ) children . For example , in the case study before us , a second child ( BC2 ) is born to the couple some 18 months after BC1 . Each parent thus adds an additional primary relationship to the two he or she already possesses , as does BC1 . Moreover , the ongoing development of BC2 both affects // and is affected by the situational and individual developments of these three other actors . In tracing these complex feed-forward effects , we first of all observe that BC1 has previously had considerable influence on the adult relationship . This influence was the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards and costs generated from BC1 . Those perceptual differences in turn contributed a great deal to the birth of BC2 . Thus BC1 indirectly influenced the birth of BC2 . Specifically , BFa took little pleasure in the fact that BC1 is female , and would very much like to have had a son . Not that BFa had planned to become any more actively involved in BC2 's initial routine care than he was with BC1 ; it is chiefly a matter that having a son accords him prestige , esteem , and status in the eyes of his male peers . In contrast BMo was opposed to any second child at this time because of the costs that would be required of her in time and energy for the care of BC2 . She was also opposed because of BC1 's considerable financial costs to the household . Although BFa insists that she allow herself to become pregnant again BMo refuses ; hence , she regulates this conflict over this particular interdependence . But one night , at his urgent insistence , they have intercourse before she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this second pregnancy she now proposes abortion ( as he did for the last one ) but he refuses to allow it , thus regulating the outcome of that conflict . That particular behavioral outcome has generated correspondingly negative subjective outcome feelings on BMo 's part . As described in Chapter 6 , she senses he is dealing with her inequitably , and she resents him for it . In response to his perceived coercion ( i.e. , feed-forward effects ) she begins to become more explicit about their tight financial constraints , and severe conflicts marked by negative communication styles are generated as they attempt to negotiate those issues . Simultaneously , BC1 begins to experience feed-forward influences upon her stemming from this array of negative adult-relationship factors , including the growing presence of BC2 . Specifically , the pregnant BMo is becoming less patient and tolerant toward BC1 and is instead becoming more harsh and impatient including frequent but mild slappings . Thus BC1 's own development is being affected in a presumably negative fashion stemming , it could be argued , from BMo 's unplanned conception and continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between her and her BFa as well as her BMo . Following the birth of BC2 ( male ) BMo went on the pill : the feedforward costs of two unplanned children was enough to overcome her // anxieties about the pill 's side effects , and to make her a rigorous contraceptor . But even more significantly , the demands and costs of two children , alongside the unpleasant and punishing decision-making interactions and outcomes regulated by her husband over money ( he refused to curtail his leisure expenses ? bowling , beer , and so on ? in favor of hers and the children 's expenses ) , were causing her to reassess her commitment to BFa . In effect , her commitment to him was declining , signaling that their sexually based situation could very likely slide from MC into a dissolution phase . She was also reassessing her own gender-role preferences ? formerly she had not wanted to be employed while she had preschoolers . But gradually , she begins to prefer to work outside the home to try to cope with their mounting debts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming significantly affected by feed-forward influences from both her adult and her child relationships . But when she raised the work and related child-care issues with her husband , he refused to cooperate ? his bargaining mode was inflexible , his communication styles negative . His behavior led to further declines in her commitment to their romantic situation ; she also went to work in spite of his noncooperation , and arranged for child care as best she could since her husband would not help . Thus these sorts of feed-forward sequences within the adult situation influenced both BC ! and BC2 ( and their development ) in that they led to significant alterations in their caregiving arrangements . Concomitantly , BFa increasingly resented the inconveniences , such as late supper , caused by his wife 's having to pick up their children after work . While venting his anger over these frustrations , he was often physically abusive to her , and sometimes to the children . Moreover , working for money and managing her children 's care arrangements had indeed altered her own personal development ? her self-esteem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control " ( Levenson , 1974 ; Walkey , 1979 ; Scanzoni and Arnett , 1987 ) shifted more from being located in fate or in husband toward being located in her own self . As measured by the limited satisfactions her husband provided her ( both economic and emotional ) , as well as by the costs he inflicted through his noncooperation in their children 's care , their romantic situation was , in her perception , developing steadily through a dissolution phase . Not only was their range of activities/interests not expanding ? over the ones they shared ( e.g. , companionship , emotional intimacy , sexuality ) ? the wife sensed extreme dissatisfaction , and discontent . // Over time , given these sets of feed-forward sequences between adults and between parents and children , BMo observed that BC1 was displaying increasingly negative behavioral symptoms . She was becoming a three-year-old who was impossible to manage ? especially when she was left at whatever child-care arrangements BMo could turn up . Consequently , the undesirable course of her own child 's development influenced BMo to arrive at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had threatened to live separately , BFa never took her seriously . Now unknown to him , she makes arrangements to move into an apartment near that of a person who was known to be a reliable caretaker of small children with whom she could leave hers . And although he became angry and abusive upon learning of her plans , she nonetheless carried them out . The negative development of her children , in effect , significantly influenced the course of her own sexually based situation . The children 's development prompted a physical separation to get them away from their father . And in turn , the separation accentuated the dissolution phase of the adult romantic situation ? a phase begun long before the actual physical separation . In turn , the separation of the adults meant that the children are now living in a single-parent household . Their development is being influenced by the fact that their biological father is seldom present and by the fact that their mother has no SBPR . That is because the sexually based situation between the parents has terminated and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity that had very occasionally surfaced between the two adults during the months prior to separation was absolutely cut off . Consequently , the adult relationship became postsexual and was shifted to the upper right segment of Figure 5.2 , separate households , dissolution phase , but continuing in a legal arrangement . Moreover , as is the case with large numbers of female single parents who never expected to be sole heads of households , the financial life-style of this mother and her children plunges even lower than it was before ( Moen , 1985 ; Weitzman , 1985 ) . However , the literature indicates that these socioeconomic facts by themselves are not useful predictors of the course of children 's development ( Lamb , 1982 ) . These kinds of social facts should not necessarily be interpreted as constraints , they may sometimes be enablings . Specifically , it appears that children 's development is best understood by taking into account economic resources alongside living arrangements ( whether dual or single adults ) as well as adult-adult and // parent-child dynamics . For example , in the perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better " is occurring in the behaviors and attitudes of both of her children since her separation ? especially in BC1 . She attributes this improvement in her children 's development to getting them away from their father . Some observers argue that separation/ divorce tend to have negative consequences for children 's development ( Wallerstein and Kelly , 1980 ) . And although in certain instances that may be a valid suggestion , it seems apparent that there are other instances in which the consequences could be seen as positive , as with Shirl and her daughter . Moreover , whatever negative short-term effects might emerge owing to separation/divorce may not remain throughout the child 's long range development . Even more importantly , researchers need to carry out more sophisticated kinds of comparisons than they do at present among children found in varieties of living arrangements . As argued earlier , the comparisons need to be made at the more generalizing level of situations ? both within and across them , over time . Ongoing children 's development must be examined in conjunction with ongoing adult relationship development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residing with both natural parents at a particular time is surely one variable , but not necessarily the overriding one , in affecting the child 's development either negatively or positively . Many other factors need to be taken into account , including the influence of the child on the separating/ intact parents . By exercising that sort of influence the child actually participates in the negative or positive feed-forward effects toward him or her generated by the separating/intact parents . A still more fundamental issue stems from the demographic trends cited by Hofferth and others regarding the steady declines in children actually living with both birth parents for 18 years . For instance , the proposition may be advanced that the highest levels of negative consequences may occur among children whose divorcing parent(s) held most strongly to benchmark expectations . Indeed , it should not be at all surprising to discover that since the broader cultural environment promotes one type of adult situation as the ideal , while subtly denigrating other possibilities and doing nothing of a policy nature to prepare persons for the realities of contemporary relationships , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these realities and that children would suffer greatly as a result ( Scanzoni , 1983 ) . Indeed , that there are not greater negative consequences stemming from this gross cultural incongruity reinforces // arguments made by Gergen ( 1980 ) and also by Lerner ( 1984 ) that both adults and children are evidently remarkably plastic , adaptive , and generative in dealing with the emerging realities of contemporary relationships , in spite of being so strongly socialized to hold expectations for benchmark experiences and nothing else . In effect , persons are being trained for an extraordinarily difficult task without being forewarned that , in fact , their preparation has very little to do with the actual realities they will subsequently face . Recall that Shirl separated to enhance the development of her children . And not only are their altered living arrangements positively influencing the children 's development , so too is the children 's continuing development influencing the development of their birth parents ' nonromantic situation , as well as influencing potential and/or actual sexually based situations that each parent may develop with other adults . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay drains his limited economic resources more so than when they were residing together . This negative influence ( as he sees it ) reduces his dating possibilities . Moreover , women with whom he might become more serious ( i.e. , enter formation phase in center column of Figure 5.1 , or else move from formation to M/ C in the same column ) must take into account the influence of those child-support demands . A third influence on any fresh sexually based situation of his is the effect of another woman on his primary relationships with his children . Now that BC1 has turned 6 , she resents and is jealous of any woman her father sees and makes conditions unbearable whenever she spends time with her father together with a woman , causing her father a great deal of dismay . Recently , he has been promoted to supervisor of his company 's delivery truck drivers , so he feels financially able to move in with a woman who has a 1-year-old child from her former marriage . Thus his own daughter 's current development and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing a fresh romantic situation . Indeed , after a time , he marries his cohab , and he and his second wife are located in left column , Figure 5.2 . However , the feed forward of that marriage ( occurring within the development of their broader relationship ) upon his primary relationship with his daughter was significant ? BC 1 no longer wished to spend any time at all with her BFa . All interactions between them ceased for the time being . By way of contrast to BC1 , his son , BC2 , enjoys spending as much time as possible with his birth father and stepmother , or what might be labeled his social mother ( SMo ) . Continuing interplay between the development of BC2 // and his father 's new sexually based situation has resulted in the development of a totally different primary relationship between BFa and BC2 ( different as compared to BFa and BC1 ) ? one marked by positive interactions and strong bondedness . Having introduced BFa 's ( Ken ) second wife ( Nora ) , it is useful to review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently being compounded by this series of ongoing developmental events . Nora is , of course , the birth mother to her own 9-year-old child ( Anna ) , who resides with Nora and Ken . And not only does Anna maintain a primary relationship with her own BMo ( Nora ) , she also maintains a relationship with her own birth father who resides in a separate household . But since she resides in the same household with the man ( Ken ) married to her mother , she has been developing a close relationship with him as well . He may be said to be her social father ( SFa ) ? a phenomenon long understood within black society ( Billingsley , 1968 ; Schulz , 1969 ; Stack , 1974 ) . Anna 's individual development is consequently influenced ( fed forward ) by the primary relationships she maintains with her own BMo ( Nora ) , her nonresident BFa , by the nonromantic situation between her own BMo and BFa , by her relationship with her SFa ( Ken ) , by the sexually based situation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains with his own son ( BC2 ) , who spends increasing amounts of time ( including overnights ) at Anna 's residence . The growing literature ( Albrecht et al. , 1983 ; Benson-Yonder Ohe , 1987 ) on blended families suggests that this multiplicity of potential influences on children 's development at the very least makes for a very different paradigm of child socialization ( and reciprocal influences on adults ) than has been the case within conventional situations . Nonetheless , owing to benchmark expectations , parents and children do not prepare themselves for the possibility that children may have to shift from idealized predictable relationships with their birth parents to some unpredictable and undefined sets of expectations with adults and other children . Hence , any set of primary relationships that any child may encounter at any particular time is subject to change . In Anna 's case , her BMo and SFa may cease residing together . In that event , her BMo may once again date and over time develop one or more additional romantic situations . Thus , depending on living arrangements ( e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other social factors , Anna may experience a series of social fathers . At the same time , her BFa may move to such a great distance that she rarely if ever sees him , or her BMo // and SFa may have a child of their own , and she would have to relate to a half sib . For the present , Anna 's development is being influenced , in terms of Figure 7.1 , by the array of primary relationships just described , and in turn , her development is influencing those several primary relationships ? especially the situation between her BMo ( Nora ) and SFa ( Ken ) . Ken asserts that Nora 's discipline of a lively Anna is too lax and virtually nonexistent . Nora refuses to allow Ken to interfere , and thus this shared activity between them gives rise to negative communication styles , inflexible modes of bargaining , and regulated conflicts . Anna is aware of the disruption she is causing her mother 's new legal marriage and that reality influences her own individual development ? among other matters , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeanor . Second , Ken and Nora are experiencing negative interactions and regulated conflicts over money because immediately after marriage Nora quit her job in order to complete the last year of her degree without previously having given any hint of her intentions to Ken ( he expected a junior-partner but finds himself instead in an unwanted headcomplement arrangement ) . And because Nora has been unsuccessful in getting Anna 's BFa to send child support , Ken particularly resents having to support Nora 's child ( your kid " ) . And since Anna is wellaware of Ken 's feelings on this issue , that aspect of the development of Ken and Nora 's situation is also having its negative influences on Anna 's own development . A third major reciprocal effect occurring between the development of Ken and Nora 's romantic situation and Anna 's development is Nora 's newly discovered pregnancy . Anna already believes that her SFa substantially favors his own BC2 over her ? negatively affecting her sense of worth and her self-esteem . She fears that another child of " his own " will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household , and further undermining her sense of self-worth . After the child 's birth , Anna 's worst fears are confirmed . Anna feels more excluded and neglected and begins to behave in a withdrawn and sullen manner . Because of the great amount of time she devotes to the infant ( his BC3 ; her BC2 ) and also to her own schooling , Nora feels unable to give much time to Anna . But Ken refuses to give more of his time and attention to Anna , as Nora requests . Their negotiations on this particular interdependence result once again in negative communication styles , inflexible bargaining modes , and regulated conflicts . Thus we may say that the birth and development of FaBC3/MoBC2 influence in certain ways Anna 's development that in // turn influenced in a particular fashion the development of Ken and Nora 's sexually based situation . Obviously , in an actual study of ongoing feed forward within a sample of adults and children , there would be considerable variation over measures of the numerous dimensions we have cited . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we have done over cognitive , emotional , physical , and intellectual aspects of children 's development . Concomitantly , attention would be paid to conditions under which more positive ( not just negative ) communication styles , bargaining modes , and consensual outcomes emerge between adults in these kinds of situations , including conditions fostering ongoing continuation of M/ C phases of adult relationships . Our goal is not to be exhaustive of all logical possibilities . Recall that instead our aim is to begin to suggest , in terms of Figure 7.1 , how we might conceptualize and research the ways in which the realities of children 's development impinge upon adults both as individuals as well as in their sexually based relationships , and how in turn , over time , those two types of adult development impinge on children 's development , and on child/ adult relationships . And , of course , we are arguing that this ongoing feed forward must be considered in the light of significant contemporary changes in the broader environment . During the same period of time that Ken was experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shirl , was immersed in her own feed-forward sequences as well . Moreover , it can be asserted that there are evident connections between the ongoing developments in their life courses , chiefly because of their common children BC1 and BC2 . That is , they are obliged to maintain a close ( contingent , influential ) relationship , located within the upper right segment of Figure 5.2 ) . We have noted connections stemming from child-support and from the inabilities of Ken and Shirrs BC1 to relate to her birth father in any way at all . Only Ken 's obligation to give Shirl money for their children keeps their nonromantic situation from being absolutely severed . During the years that she is a single parent ( living alone with BC1 and BC2 ) , Shirl develops a series of romantic situations but in no case has she ever coresided or partnered with anyone . In effect , she has been shifting between the upper right ( nonromantic situations ) and the center columns of Figure 5.1 . Presumably , that series of romantic and nonromantic situations had certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and BC2 . After a time , Shirl meets a high school teacher ( Neil ) and in the course of their romantic
