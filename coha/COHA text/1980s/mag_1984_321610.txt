As the Gemayel government crumbles , the U.S. both fires and falls back <P> Even for a city that has learned to live with fear and blood as easily as other places cope with traffic jams and smog , the battle was terrifying . There was no warning as the gangs of Muslim militiamen , many dressed in civvies and cloth masks , swept into West Beirut to fight the Lebanese Army soldiers . The dreaded chatter of automatic rifles cleared the streets , trapping thousands in homes and offices . Those who dared peek from behind curtains or doorways saw flashes of chaos : a gunman scrambling madly , a car ablaze , someone shouting something to somebody out of sight . <P> As darkness fell , the combat grew into the most savage street fighting West Beirut has seen since Lebanon slipped into civil war nine years ago . Afraid of what the night would bring , many sought refuge in basements , stairwells , wherever they stood the best chance of surviving a direct hit by grenade or mortar . Every minute seemed to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the usual wails of crisis could not be heard : the streets had grown so dangerous that ambulances and fire trucks did not risk making runs . <P> When the shooting stopped , West Beirut was under the full control of Muslim militiamen for the first time in more than a year . As people scurried to stock up on bread and bottled water in case the fighting flared up again , they could see how much damage had been done . Gaping holes riddled the upper floors of apartment buildings , snapped trees littered the streets , and burned-out cars still smoldered on nearly every block . Shattered glass and chunks of masonry lay everywhere . At the American University Hospital , doctors raced to make room for the rush of wounded , while the morgues quickly filled up . An estimated 300 people died , and 1,000 were injured in the latest round of terror . <P> At stake in the fighting was the survival of the government of Amin Gemayel , 42 , the boyish Maronite Christian who has been President since September 1982 . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan Administration hastily changed the rules of its support for him . In a dramatic reversal , a White House spokesman announced that Ronald Reagan was ordering the phased " redeployment " of the 1,600 Marines stationed at Beirut airport to ships offshore . At the same time , the President authorized increased naval and air strikes against Syrian-controlled factions that were firing into Beirut , thereby breaking with the practice of retaliating only when U.S. forces were directly imperiled . Despite Washington 's avowals that it was not " cutting and running , " as many critics charged , the initial reaction at home and abroad was that Reagan was responding to his domestic critics who had been demanding that he get the U.S. out of Lebanon .
