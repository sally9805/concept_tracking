Louisiana 's Dixieland music and crayfish gumbo have drawn millions of tourists over the years , but the state has had far less success in attracting new businesses and jobs . To help it compete with high-tech meccas such as California and Massachusetts , the Louisiana legislature has approved a jazzy venture-capital program . The new law , believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S. , will provide income tax credits of up to 35% for individuals or companies investing in venture-capital firms in the Bayou State . Louisiana has long lacked investment money for young , speculative businesses . Much of the state 's cash pool has been pumped into its oil and gas industries . <P> The new incentive is expected to produce up to $100 million in investments over the next five years . Since the program is aimed specifically at high-tech businesses , the tax break excludes such industries as real estate , banking , oil and gas . Otherwise the state has put few restrictions on the money . Says Governor David Treen : " Other states have placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then tangles the programs in red tape . " In Louisiana , it will be up to private investors to pick winners .
