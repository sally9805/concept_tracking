For Eurocommunists , anguish and disarray <P> <P> " A phase has come to an end . The driving force , which had its origin in the October Revolution , has exhausted itself . " <P> <P> " An absolute aberration of history , in blatant contradiction of the very essence of Socialism , Marxism and Leninism . " <P> <P> These harsh condemnations of General Wojciech Jaruzelski 's declaration of martial law in Poland came not from the Reagan White House nor from staunch anti-Communists abroad . Instead , they were issued , respectively , by the leaders of two of the largest Communist parties in Western Europe : Enrico Berlinguer , the angular , scholarly looking theoretician who heads the 1.7 million member Italian Communist Party ( P.C.I. ) , and his Spanish counterpart , the amiable , grandfatherly Santiago Carrillo , who heads an organization of 140,000 members . Their reactions went further than any previous disavowals of Soviet-style Communism by Western European comrades . " They have crossed a threshold , " says Pierre Hassner of Paris ' Institut d'Etudes Politiques . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eurocommunists , moreover , have been keeping up the pressure . " How many workers , how many Italian laborers aspire to the type of society , and economic and political order , that exists in the Soviet Union and in the other Eastern European countries ? " Berlinguer asked during a three-day meeting of the P.C.I . ' s Central Committee . " I believe that if we held a referendum , they would turn out to be only a tiny minority . " Said Carrillo at a meeting of his party 's Central Committee : " The total failure of the Communist party of Poland is a demonstration of the total failure of the Soviet Union to export its system to other countries . " <P> The accusations hit home-hard . After maintaining a stony silence , the Soviet Union bitterly denounced Italy 's P.C.I . on Sunday for slander . " Something monstrous has happened , " charged Pravda , the party paper , claiming that the positions taken by the P.C.I , on Soviet foreign policy were " truly sacrilegious . " <P> The complaints of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaruzelski 's move has sown among , and sometimes within , Western Europe 's Communist parties . The denouncements by Berlinguer and Carrillo of the crackdown were even stronger than some of the statements made by NATO governments . Britain 's tiny Communist Party ( 20,600 members ) has called for the restoration of all democratic rights and a return to civilian rule in Poland . The French Communist Party , the only one in Western Europe to enjoy a share of government power , is experiencing internal divisions over its refusal to denounce the martial law in Poland . Still , Portuguese Party Leader Alvaro Cunhal remained faithful to his Stalinist reputation by calling the pro-Solidarity demonstrations in Lisbon " ridiculous monkeyshines in support of counterrevolution in Poland . " Similarly , Greece 's Communist Party , which won 11% of the votes in last fall 's elections , described criticism of Polish martial law as " coldblooded hysteria . "
