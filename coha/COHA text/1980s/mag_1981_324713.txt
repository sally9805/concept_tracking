Feathers fly in the fight over how to save the big , ugly birds <P> The male lets out a cry that sounds like a rake being scraped over cement . He flaps his wings-which span 9 ft. - at a bird only another condor could love : an ungainly , 20-lb. female , with lugubrious black feathers , yellow eyes and a bald , orange head . She coyly nibbles at his neck , and off they fly , monogamous partners for life . They will produce a single 4-in. egg every two years , and their ugly infant will be dependent upon them for a year-or until he is old enough to find carrion for himself . <P> Pretty or not , that kind of romance has kept the California condor around since saber-toothed tigers roamed the Sierra Nevada . Whether the bird will continue to survive , however , has been in serious doubt since the last century . As North America 's largest land bird , the condor has always made a seductively easy target . Indians prized its tough , 2-ft. - long feathers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $300 . During the 1849 gold rush , its hollow quill feathers , waterproof and in. in diameter , were favored as gold-dust containers . Even after the condor became a federally protected species in 1963 , farming and development continued to destroy its habitat . Where condors once flourished by the thousands , all the way from Canada to Baja California , today fewer than 30 remain , living mainly in 54,000 acres of sanctuary north of Los Angeles . <P> Hoping to prevent the condor 's " rapidly approaching extinction , " the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Audubon Society presented the state of California with a radical proposal . Under its three-year plan , 21 condors would be trapped , nine to be kept for breeding , twelve to be tagged and released with tiny radio transmitters clipped to the back of their wings , allowing biologists to track them and study their life cycle . Some condor protectionists objected . The birds , they argued , are extremely sensitive to human contact . A man standing 500 yds. away can keep a condor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers attempted to weigh a two-month-old chick at its nesting site , the bird collapsed and died of shock and acute heart failure . Moreover , the California condor has yet to perform its mating ritual in a cage . Last month the state fish and game commission approved a more modest intervention : two birds to be radio-tagged and only three kept for breeding during the first year , one of them to be mated at the Los Angeles Zoo with Topa Topa , the only California condor now in captivity .
