The strongest of those are thriving with a variety of strategies , ranging from the traditional , like mortgage lending , to the more complex and controversial , like " junk bonds. " // Consider four of the most profitable institutions in Southern California , the biggest savings and loan market in the nation . Each is publicly held. // At one end of the spectrum is Home Savings of America , the main subsidiary of H. F. Ahmanson &; Company of Los Angeles . Home Savings , the nation ' s largest savings institution , sticks almost exclusively to gathering deposits through its branches and making adjustable-rate mortgages , a strategy as conservative as any in the business. // Like Home Savings , the Great Western Financial Corporation is a traditional mortgage lender . But Great Western , based in Beverly Hills , has diversified into consumer loans and credit cards , businesses more typically pursued by commercial banks. // The Downey Savings and Loan Association of Newport Beach also considers itself a conservative institution . But it has concentrated on and prospered in a field that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers. // At the far end of the spectrum is the Columbia Savings and Loan Association , which has been extremely successful investing in junk bonds and other ventures that some regulators and analysts consider too risky for an institution using federally insured deposits. // The continued success of the healthiest institutions illustrates the inherent potential for profit in the business and the allure of the savings industry to some of the nation ' s smartest investors. // " I can ' t say it ' s a simple business anymore , " said Preston Martin , a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board . " But it is still a considerable opportunity if you can keep costs down and manage the interest-rate volatility . " Mr. Martin is a member of a group led by William E. Simon , the former Treasury Secretary , that has acquired a number of failed and healthy savings institutions in California and Hawaii. // While they support efforts to clean up the industry , Home Savings , Great Western , Downey and Columbia are concerned about the Bush Administration ' s plan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to the Administration ' s proposal that savings and loan institutions should continue to pay far more than banks for deposit insurance , applied on Friday to leave the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which insures deposits at commercial and savings banks . Great Western , which has long expressed the same concern , made a similar application last fall. // Both Home Savings and Great Western are also upset at being asked to pay a large portion of the costs of cleaning up " problems we did not create " arising from deregulation policies " we strongly opposed , " as Richard H. Deihl , the chairman of Home Savings and its parent company , put it last week. // Home Savings and Great Western are expected to face long battles over their requests since the Administration ' s bailout plan depends heavily on income from the deposit premiums paid by savings and loan institutions . More than 1 , 200 savings and loans could meet the requirements for F.D.I.C. insurance. // Columbia and , to a lesser extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to restrict some of the investment powers granted under deregulation. // " It would be a shame and an overreaction to the troubles of the thrift industry to begin reregulating the financial services industry , " said Lawrence K. Fish , the president of Columbia Savings . Home Savings : Minimum Risk Home Savings has been one of the most aggressive institutions in the industry in switching from fixed-rate mortgages , the standard until the early 1980 ' s , to adjustable-rate mortgages . Adjustable-rate mortgages have been the most important factor in reducing the vulnerability to rising interest rates. // At the end of 1988 , 88 percent of the mortgages in Home Savings ' portfolio were adjustable rate , one of the highest percentages in the industry . The percentage would have been higher except for the company ' s acquisition last year of the Bowery Savings Bank of New York . Home Savings , with assets of more than $39 billion , earned $202 million in 1988. // Home Savings is also unusual for its almost exclusive reliance for funds on its network of 352 branches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its $29. 6 billion in deposits at the end of 1988 was made up of retail deposits , a third of it in passbook , checking and money market accounts carrying interest rates of 5. 5 percent or less. // Because of its strong retail deposit base , Home Savings does not have to borrow money at relatively high interest rates or compete for large certificates of deposit , which typically carry premium interest rates. // Gerald S. Haims , an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles , called Home Savings the top loan-origination network . " They turn out adjustable-rate mortgages like Lever Brothers turns out soap , " he said . " They ' ve maintained excellent quality control and they ' ve basically stayed out of other areas . " Great Western : Diversified With nearly $33 billion in assets , Great Western is the nation ' s third-largest savings institution and Home Savings ' major competitor in California . Great Western , which had profit of $248 million in 1988 , also considers the adjustable-rate mortgage its main business . But Mr. Haims said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adjustable mortgages , Great Western ' s diversification into consumer loans , credit cards and other financial services not traditionally offered by savings and loans makes its operations look more and more like a commercial bank , Mr. Haims said. // James F. Montgomery , Great Western ' s chairman and chief executive , said the institution had rejected most of the other diversification avenues opened by deregulation. // For example , during 1983 , the company formed a commercial loan group to explore lending to small businesses . Mr. Montgomery decided to shut the operation down before it made its first loan. // " We don ' t know a whole lot about commercial lending , and some of these other things didn ' t make a whole lot of sense to us , " Mr. Montgomery said. // One of Great Western ' s tactics was to build its capital . It already meets the stricter capital rules proposed by the Bush Administration. // Great Western ' s basic strategy is to be " a real estate-oriented consumer bank , " Mr. Montgomery said. // Consumer loans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 percent of Great Western ' s lending , fit into the " retail family level " that Great Western is comfortable with , Mr. Montgomery said . Downey Savings : Specialized Loans Downey Savings is not only far smaller than Home Savings or Great Western , with $4. 3 billion in assets , but it also considers itself as much a real estate developer as a mortgage lender . Founded in 1957 with $330 , 000 in capital , it has more than $200 million in capital . Maurice McAlister , Downey ' s president and one of its founders , said that about 40 percent of the increase in capital came from profits on development projects . Its 1988 profit was $28. 9 million. // Direct investment in real estate has always been risky for savings institutions . But Mr. McAlister said that by sticking to its specialty of small shopping centers , Downey has avoided serious problems . He said the company ' s strategy was not to go ahead with a project until it has enough tenants to insure success. // In mortgage lending , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only on single-family houses selling for less than $350 , 000 , a strategy that has kept defaults low . Columbia Savings : Strong Profits Columbia Savings , with assets of $12. 7 billion , may be best known for the salary of its chairman , Thomas Spielgel - $5. 4 million in 1987 - whose family controls the institution . With its large portfolio of junk bonds and mortgage-backed securities , Columbia also is one of the nation ' s least traditional savings and loans. // The nature of its investments has always drawn criticism from regulators and analysts who think that Columbia should not be speculating on junk bonds and other securities with deposits that the Government and ultimately the taxpayer are insuring . At the same time , however , Columbia has a strong record of profitability that its critics can not argue with. // " I ' ll grant that Columbia has done very well , " Mr. Haims of Seidler Amdec said . " But the critical question is whether you regard the institution as a thrift and whether the Government should back the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-run institution . " Columbia had profit of $65 million in 1988. // After a long review of its operations , Columbia has decided to continue pursuing its current business , including junk-bond investing , Mr. Fish , its president , said . The company is also adding nontraditional businesses . Drawing on its investment prowess , it wants to do more money management . And earlier this month it announced that it was forming a corporate finance division. // At the same time , though , Columbia wants to invest in its traditional retail branch business . " We found that we have a highly profitable foundation of thrift activity that we can build on to enhance the core earnings of the corporation , " Mr. Fish said . <> <> Making Money in the Savings Business <> <> Although hundreds of savings institutions across the country have failed , many are healthy .
