GILT TRIP At Calgary all that glitters wo n't be gold , including the gold medals , which , like those awarded at other recent Olympics , will actually consist of 6.73 ounces of gilded sterling silver . The medals will be only a 10th of an inch thick and worth about $400 each . // FLAT OUT A luger often turns a blind eye to danger , and he or she will try to visualize the course before lying supine on the sled . But once the run has started , the luger stares at the sky much of the time . This is because raising the head increases wind resistance and slows the sled. // GLIDING VS . SKATING // The way Gerhard Grimmer of East Germany won a 50-km cross-country race in 1971 at Holmenkollen , near Oslo , may have been unorthodox , but it worked . That year fluky snow conditions forced racers to stop repeatedly along the course to rewax or change skis . Grimmer did n't bother . Instead , he abandoned the parallel technique , the graceful gliding motion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( above , left ) , and began " skating " ( above , right ) by pushing off the inside edge of his weight-bearing ski . He won by seven minutes , the equivalent of winning a marathon by a mile . // Since then , variations on Grimmer 's technique have gradually transformed cross-country competition . And that has also made a lot of purists pretty hot under the skis . Why ? Because the skating method is very fast . Most classic skiers do n't stand a chance against well-trained skaters , and many European sports officials , particularly those from the U.S.S.R. , Norway and Finland , have tried to get the Fdration Internationale de Ski to strictly limit skating in races . " They just did n't like it because it was a change from the sport they think they invented , " says John Caldwell , former coach of the U.S. cross-country team . // But you ca n't keep a good technique down . In 1986 a Solomonic bargain was struck : Half of the cross-country ski races at Calgary ( men 's 15- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be skied using the classic technique ; the others ( men 's 50-km and 4 x 10-km relay , women 's 20-km and 4 x 5-km relay ) may be done freestyle , which means that anyone who wants to win those races will skate them . // SMOOTHIES // In sports , loose , rough clothing is a drag , literally . For example , a floppy cotton jersey can boost wind resistance by up to 15% . Engineers calculate that in the 100-meter dash a reduction of as little as 2% in resistance can save a 10th of a second . In an Olympic downhill race , that can be the difference between gold and bronze . But racing in the buff is n't the answer , either . Sleek costumes are de rigueur in winter sports not for fashion 's sake but because aerodynamically correct togs offer less resistance than bare skin . // Nobody has taken this principle more to heart than lugers , with their suits made of a rubberlike substance . Rubber rompers may sound a bit kinky , but they make aerodynamic sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecules coming into contact with the surface of a body . The slick covering a luger wears allows the air molecules to slip past more easily . // JUMPING JACKS // Even in this high-tech age the length of a ski jumper 's leap is still measured by the naked eye . During competition , officials stand on either side of the hill , at carefully measured one-meter intervals , watching the skier 's feet as he flies through the air . When the skier lands , the official closest to the touchdown point raises his hand to indicate the distance of the jump . // During the Sarajevo Games , 114-pound Jens Weissflog of East Germany was likened to " a piece of paper in the wind " when he won the 70-meter jump , but a better analogy would have been a paper airplane , because a ski jumper gets a similar sort of aerodynamic lift . The skier-inflight gets lift by holding his body at about a 35-degree angle over his skis . As he flies , the air is drawn around his body and skis , causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vortices decrease air pressure over the skier 's back and increase pressure below his chest . The pressure differential pushes him upward slightly , keeping him from falling like a stone . // HEAD START // It may look as if a skier is trying to go down the hill on his face instead of his skis when he bursts headlong out of the starting gate ( below ) , but he 's actually shaving hundredths of a second off his time . By launching his torso out over the run , the skier is already plummeting downhill by the time his legs knock aside the wand that starts the timer . // At the bottom of the bill , the timer stops when the skier breaks an electronic beam at about knee height . By lifting the tips of his skis , a clever skier can make the skis pass through the beam ahead of his legs . // Lugers have similar tricks . The timer is triggered at the start of the run and stopped at the end by electronic beams aimed three inches above the ice . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top  --  thus delaying the timer 's start by a fraction of a second  --  and extend their toes as far in front of the sled as possible at the bottom of the run . // BOBBING ALONG // Before doing an $850,000 bobsled design for the U.S. team , engineers at Airflow Sciences Corp. , a fluid-mechanics consulting firm in Livonia , Mich. , conducted computer simulations to find out where they should concentrate their efforts . They simulated hundreds of bobsled runs , varying such things as the weight of the sled , starting speed , friction on the sled 's runners and aerodynamic drag . To their surprise , it is the athletes who matter most . More important than sled design is push time  --  how long it takes the sledders to propel their craft and leap into it over the 50-meter starting run . As little as a 10th of a second off push time shaves a quarter to a third of a second off run time , which is plenty of time to determine who will win  --  or lose  --  a gold medal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account the trickiest part of launching a bobsled  --  jumping into it without scratching your teammates with the hundreds of needles that project from the soles of your sledding shoes . The needles grip the ice during push time . // KING TUCK // A downhill race goes to the swiftest , and often that 's the racer who follows the shortest course . A skier tries to avoid being airborne because time spent in the air increases the distance he must travel . To keep from being pitched skyward by bumps , he prejumps them by pulling his skis off the snow just before they hit the bumps ( above ) . // Downhill racers reduce wind resistance by tucking their bodies into something close to the fetal position ( left ) . The tighter the tuck , the more smoothly air flows around the skier . When the flow is chaotic , eddies are created behind the racer , lowering the air pressure and exerting a slight backward tug . // FIGURE THIS OUT // Unraveling how the judges score Olympic figure skating is just about as difficult as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The competition consists of three events : the compulsory figures , which count for 30% of the total score ; the short program ( 20% ) ; and the long program . The skater is required to perform three figures during the compulsories and seven elements in the two-minute short program  --  including spins , specific sequences of foot movements and jumps . The freestyle program lasts four minutes for women , 4 minutes for men . // Now matters get complicated . Each of the compulsory figures is awarded a score ranging from zero to six on the basis of technical merit . The short and long programs get one mark each for technique and one for artistic impression . Fractions of a point are deducted for incorrect technique and for elements missed from the short program . The nine judges keep track of the scores they 've given each competitor , and when all the contestants have finished , each judge ranks them by these scores . // There 's more . After each event has been completed , accountants compute a skater 's total score by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.6 , his rank in the short program by 0.4 and his rank in the long program by 1.0 , and add it all together for the skater 's total score . // Here 's an example . Let 's say a skater finishes second in the compulsories , then fourth in the short program and third in the long . His score for the compulsories would be 2 x 0.6 , or 1.2 . For the short program it would be 4 X 0.4 , or 1.6 ; for the long , 3 X 1.0 , or 3.0 . Thus his total is 1.2 + 1.6 + 3.0 = 5.8 . Oh , yes , the contestant with the lowest score wins .
