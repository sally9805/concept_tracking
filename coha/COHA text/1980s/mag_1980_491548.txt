Oats have had a poor press up until now . " Sowing wild oats " is a traditional phase for wasting time , or worse . And , of course , there was Dr. Samuel Johnson 's devastating put-down in his famous dictionary with the definition : Oats  --  A grain which in England is generally given to horses , but in Scotland supports the people . But help is now on the way for this worthy cereal in the person of Dr. James Ander  --  son , who brings us evidence that oats may now be emerg  --  ing as a far more important item in our diet than had previously been supposed . Scientists are loathe to use words like " breakthrough " and " discovery " with respect to research which promises to add to our knowledge con  --  cerning the drama of living , and Dr. Anderson is a man of notable restraint , especially when talking about his own research work . But it still does seem that closing in on some exciting new facts relative to the health of us all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Kentucky Medical College , he has recently discovered that a diet high in fiber can reduce the insulin re  --  quirement of some diabetics and in some cases eliminate it completely . Dr. Anderson has also discovered that oat fiber can lower the bloodcholesterol levels . Because high cholesterol contributes to much ill  --  ness , particularly in our own culture , his work takes on special meaning . Dr. Anderson goes straight to the problem and pulls no punches : " Over the last century there has been a gradual change in the diet of the average American . We are eat  --  ing more fat and cholesterol as well as more sugar than our great-grandparents did . We eat less unrefined starch from potatoes , beans and whole grains . Most of the beneficial fiber is stripped from our foods before they reach our tables . Many experts feel that these changes in diet are largely responsible for the present epidemic of heart at  --  tacks , strokes , hardening of the arteries and diabetes . Many premature deaths could be prevented by proper attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused recently on plant fiber and roughage . Plant fiber is that portion of vegetables , fruits and grains which is not digested by the human small intestinal tract . Plant fibers serve two main purposes in nature . First , they form the structural framework of plants . Second , certain plants such as beans store their sugars in plant fibers . Why should we eat plant fibers ? Several benefits result from raising the fiber intake above the low levels that most Americans eat . Plant fibers improve bowel function and relieve constipation . These fibers absorb water and increase the size of bowel movements . For this reason , fibers are now used to treat and prevent diverticulosis of the colon . " Dr. Anderson is a man in his ear  --  ly 40s who looks younger and Continued on page 114 bishop 's chair . The history and appearance of the stave churches emphasize the point that the Norwegian peasants , no matter how difficult or depressing their existence , still retained a good deal of their love of life and expressed it in their churches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stave churches and their later decoration with rosepainting are ec  --  centricity and flamboyance ; it 's almost as if the peasants were laughing at or defying their difficult lot in life . If this inter  --  pretation is correct , the Norwegian stave churches give us one of human history 's most moving artistic documents . A Ground of Hope continued from page 47 most core . But there are other ways by which love works its perfect work . It may stab the spirit by calling forth a bitter , scathing self-judgment . The heights to which it calls may seem so high that all incentive is lost and the individual is strick  --  en with an utter hopeless  --  ness and despair . It may throw in relief old and for  --  gotten weaknesses to which one has made the adjust . ment of acceptance  --  but which now stir in their place to offer themselves as testi  --  mony of one 's unworthiness and to challenge the love with their embarrassing authenticity . Love has no awareness of merit or demerit ; it has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sured . It does not seek to balance giving and receiv  --  ing . Love loves ; this is its nature . But this does not mean that love is blind , naive or pretentious . It does mean that love holds its ob  --  ject securely in its grasp , calling all that it sees by its true name but surrounding all with a wisdom born of both its passion and its un  --  derstanding . Here is no traf  --  fic in sentimentality , no ca tering to weakness or strength . Instead , there is robust vitality that quickens the roots of personality , creating an unfolding of the self that redefines , reshapes and makes all things new . Such an experience is so fundamental in quality that an individual knows that what is happening to him can outlast all things without itself being dissipated or lost . Whence comes this power which seems to be the point of referral for all experience and the essence of all meaning ? No created thing , no single unit of life , can be the source of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is caught and held by something so much more than he can ever think or be that there is but one word by which its mean  --  ing can be encompassed  --  God . This is the confirmation that is called forth from the ground of his being by that which in  --  cludes him but is more than he is  --  at once the end all and be all of life . There must not be the mischievous confusion over labels  --  the word most congenial to my mind and spirit is God . I can sympathize with Meister Eckhart when exhaust  --  ing all categories which exploded and crumbled at hisfeet  --  at such a moment of high mystical intensity he burst forth with words that exhausted all meaning by declaring that God is the " Nameless Nothing " or the " Godhead " where no categories can hold . As for me , the meaning summarizes itself : God is the Creator of life and the living substance , God bottoms all exis  --  tence and His creation is the lung through which He breathes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him Thou for He heareth And spirit with spirit may meet Closer is He than breathing Nearer than hands or feet . Dr. Anderson continued from page 35 whose general air of cheery enjoyment of life , plus his habit of understatement , can possibly obscure the significance of his subject . He does n't use the word epidemic lightly when he refers to the diseases which are so widespread in our own civilization today . It 's scary when you get right down to thinking about it . If fiber is one of the answers , I ask him , how much of it should we eat ? Dr. Anderson is not going to turn your whole life style around just to prove his point . For example , he has drawn up a sample food plan for a high-fiber diet of 1,500 calories per day which is mighty palatable Rsee chart with this article listing the foods in this plan ) and con  --  tains foods all of us enjoy eating simply for pleasure as well as fiber supplements which we should include simply for health as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply : more than we do now . " No firm recommenda  --  tion can be made at present . The measurement of ' crude fiber ' is not a good indicator of the plant fiber content of most foods . Thus the fiber content of most cereals and cereal products is much higher than stated on the label . At the pres  --  ent we recommend that all adults should receive at least 40 grams of fiber per day . You can greatly increase your fiber in  --  take by substituting fiber-rich foods you already eat . Whole wheat bread , bran cereals , oats , beans and most vegetables are good sources of fiber . " Dr. Anderson reveals some extraordinary results with dia  --  betics . One patient at the Lexington . Kentucky , Veterans Medical Center " came into the hospital taking 38 units of in  --  sulin a day and went home taking zero . This fellow had to spend a month in the hospital , but he had been insulin-depen  --  dent for years . " The doctor merely offers the thought that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no high-powered new drug , no revolutionary new machinery is in  --  volved  --  as he is simply leading a sensible return to old , prov  --  en methods . He 's just going back to a high-carbohydrate , low-fat , high-fiber diet , which is very much the same as everyone ate before the advent of large-scale food processing . For example , between the years 1875 and 1895 , precisely the period when this country as a whole turned away from fiber-rich , stone-ground wheat flour and switched to more refined , roller-milled flour containing less fiber , death statistics in New York City due to diabetes took an enormous jump . Later on , during World War II and in the years following , Great Britain switched to a flour which used more of the wheat grain and consequently contained more fiber . The death rate during that period fell off 55 percent in men and 54 percent in women . At . the end of that period , the diabetes death rate for women was at its lowest level in the 20th cen  --  tury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millers again removed the bran to further refine the flour . Predict  --  ably , the diabetes death rate went back up its present level . Dr. Anderson is aware of all this , and to the five percent of our population who suffer from diabetes this is dramatic , if very simple and basic , reasoning . But the fallout from Dr. Anderson 's work affects all of us . When treating his diabetic patients via his high-fiber diet , Dr. Anderson discovered an average drop of 30 percent in cholesterol levels in their blood . That , of course , is very meaningful to diabetics , who are prone to the clogging of blood vessels with fat that can lead to heart disease . Why not the rest of us , then ? " Right , " says Dr. Anderson . " This diet would be healthful for every American . Many physicians tell their patients they 're doing fine when they have cholesterol levels of 250 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood . They consider 200 to 260 to be ' normal . ' Well , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most people would be far healthier if they got their cholesterol down to 180 . " And oats will help ? " You bet , " says the doctor . He whips out a pencil and sketches for me what he calls " the heart attack risk chart . " Here it is : To me , as a lay person unacquainted with medicine but interested as we all are today in the likelihood of heart prob  --  lems , Dr. Anderson 's simple little arch was one of the most il  --  luminating and thought-provoking charts I had ever seen . Continued on page 117 Dr. Anderson continued from page 115 " Heredity " and " personality " seem well beyond control , so Dr. Anderson agreed with me that we should face this philosophically and stoically . Since neither he nor I approach obesity and find even the slightest tendency toward sloth virtually unthinkable , the other elements contributing to a heart condition came under strict scrutiny . We have already observed the relation  --  ship between diabetes and heart prob  --  lems and how treatment of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cigarettes , this nation is slowly beginning to recognize ( if not do anything about ) are just plain bad for your heart . The other elements in the arch bring out a few comments from Dr. Anderson . " The three major risk factors for heart attacks and vascular disease , " he says , " are elevated cholesterol , hypertension and elevated blood pres  --  sure . I have put asterisks by those which seem to be amenable to diet . " The doctor has drawn up the follow  --  ing menu as a sample of how to keep your weight under control , get the right amount of fiber and other neces  --  sary content , and enjoy your meals as well . Breakfast 2/3 cup bran buds V. banana 2 slices whole wheat . toast 1 cup skim milk 1 tsp. corn oil margarine 10 a.m. snack 1 whole wheat muffin Noon meal 1 cup white bean soup 1/2 cup hash brown potatoes 1/4 cup stewed tomatoes 1/2 cup pickled beets 1 small fresh apple , cored 1 slice whole wheat bread 2 tsp. corn oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato 1/2 cup corn ' A cup carrots Salad : V. cup lettuce 1 medium cucumber 1 tbsp. zero dressings 1/2 cup water-packed peaches 1 whole wheat muffin 1 tsp. corn oil margarine Evening snack 1 whole wheat muffin *This specially prepared low-calorie dressing con  --  tains only 4 calories/tablespoon . Just for the record , this meal plan provides 97 grams of protein , 85 grams of simple carbohydrates , 187 grams of Continued on page 122 Dr. Anderson continued from page 117 complex carbohydrates , 38 grams of fat , 90 grams of cholesterol and 75 grams of plant fiber per day . He even allows moderate amounts of coffee , tea and other low-calorie beverages with it . And , when you look it over , it 's good eating , too . Dr. Anderson is not a man to freak us out with a diet which only a squirrel could relish . He regards taste as one of the pleasures of life , but he wants to keep it under control so that it does n't interfere with health . The essence of what he says next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cho  --  lesterol and find that there are ' good guys ' in it as well as ' bad guys . ' The good guys , the high-density lipids ( HDL ) in protein cholesterol , tend to protect you from heart attacks . And the bad guys , the low-density lipopro  --  teins ( the LDL ) tend to enhance your likelihood of heart attacks . Now , with our oat diet we are getting into selec  --  tively exchanging these bad guys for good guys . " Translated , the oat diet not only gives you a high-fiber content for digestion and nutrition , it actually works to bring around choles  --  terol itself to fighting on your behalf . Wheat does n't do it , or corn ; but oats do . " Water-soluble fibers , such as oats , " says Dr. Anderson , " seem in practice to be especially effective in lowering cholesterol . Experiments per  --  formed by Dr. De Groot in the ' 60s seem to indi  --  cate as much , but to ob  --  tain the lowering of the count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed a patient 140 grams of oats per day . That amounts to six large bowls of oats , and that 's not very practical . It 's not something you can ex  --  pect people to do for very long . So we rea  --  soned that if you took an oat bran fraction per  --  haps you would get a richer fiber fraction . On that basis , you could feed someone 100 grams of oat bran per day and that would have 30 grams of fiber , which would be good cholesterol-lowering intake . De Groot was feeding his experimental pa  --  tients those six large bowls of oatmeal every day for six weeks , and that 's a lot of oatmeal . " The net of this was that Dr. Ander  --  son addressed himself to the Quaker Oats Company , which does not pres  --  ently offer oat bran among its other products , and advised them of the potential of the grain to prevent cholesterol build-up . So they made him up some oat bran , and Dr. Anderson put it to the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did lower cholesterol even more than our usual high-fiber diet . Our usual high-carbohydrate high-fiber diet lowers cholesterol by an average of 25 percent , which is not too bad , but with oat bran we found we ob  --  tained about a 35 percent reduction in the serum cholesterol . The exciting thing  --  although it needs further docu  --  mentation  --  is that in our preliminary studies we observed that oat bran selectively lowered the bad guys , the LDL , while raising the good guys , the HDL cholesterol . You see , in the artery , the LDL cholesterol spews cholesterol into the artery for plaque formation whereas the HDL choles  --  terol ( the good guys ) serves a scavenger function in picking up cholesterol . " Dr. Anderson grins to himself at a sudden thought . It was funny , " he says . " When we started making our observations on oats known  --  cautiously , of course  --  we ran into the usual nonbelievers . ' OK , ' they said , ' so it works out fine on humans . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it on rats ? ' " Medical experimentation was re  --  versing itself . " So much for academic medicine , " says Dr. Anderson , laughing heartily . " It helped the rats , too , and now everybody 's happy . In fact , we found even more striking reductions in LDL and increases in HDL cholesterol . So we now have academic credibility , and we can go back and further test it on humans . " Dr. Anderson hopes , of course , that someday soon oat bran will be commercially avail  --  able . It is like a coarse corn meal , and he mixes it into something like farina , flavors it with a little cinnamon or nutmeg , and he 's got a good , hot cereal . It in  --  corporates into bakery products as well . For the time being , you ca n't go wrong eating oatmeal or oats in any form . As Dr. Anderson says , it has the same therapeutic ef  --  fect as the oat bran we 've been discussing , but you just have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the bran . He 's willing to generalize . " As a starter , we said 100 grams of oat bran a day . We have n't titrated downward , but maybe for people who do n't have bad cholesterol problems , eating 25 grams of oat bran or 50 grams of whole oats a day would have favorable effects in lowering cholesterol . " So that 's the new message . Dr. Anderson is telling his story all over the country at one medical forum after another and was recently invited to present his data at a summit con  --  ference in Washington , D.C. , to deter  --  mine recommendations to be made to the President and Congress concerning future directions in treating diabetes . Recently , he also spoke in California at a meeting of the American Diabetes Association . To Dr. Anderson go our admiration for his great work and our hopes for what he will be discovering in the future . We give a bow to the humble oat , originally a grain from western Europe which has now spread all over the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along .

Bypass continued from page 40 put it simply , HDL seems to act like " Drano " in the arterial system . A University of California at San Francisco research group have now come up with a medical regime for the management of the low-HDL high  --  LDL victim . One drug , Colestepol , re  --  duces the cholesterol levels because it binds bile acids , a breakdown product of cholesterol , thus triggering a string of reactions which lowers cholesterol levels . Nicotinic acid , the vitamin niacin , inhibits formation in the liver of lipoproteins , the large molecules that transport cholesterol . Investigations by Miller and Hamil  --  ton from Tulane University School of Medicine and by W.B. Parsons show that nicotinic acid can alter the lipids in the blood rather dramatically . Their studies indicate that 1 gram of nico  --  tinic acid taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Further studies are in progress showing that this vita  --  min also has promise in raising the HDL . Nicotinic acid is not without side effects . Patients must build up to the dose of 3 grams daily . Marked flushing of the skin can be very annoying , and it can cause heartburn or stomach pains . Patients are told to gradually increase the dose over several weeks , take it with meals and use antacids when hy  --  peracidity symptoms are a factor .
