LOOK WHO 'S RUNNING FOR FIRST LADY ... . by William Barry Furlong By and large , the women who aspire to occupy the White House for the next four years  --  entering on the arm of a man  --  are far more interesting than their mates . They have personalities which are subtle , complex , sometimes tormenting  --  to themselves more than others  --  and they have a sense of personal style that transcends the Cliches-of-image that burden the men . Consider that among these women there are : ? Two who are confessed alcoholics ; ? A rock-and-roll singer who has not gotten around to formalizing her relationship with a presidential candidate by taking the marriage vows ; ? A former film actress who met her husband  --  a very conservative candidate  --  at a time when she was thought , by some , to be sympathetic to the communists in Hollywood ; ? An outspoken woman who has observed : " Oh , it 's very easy to raise teen-agers these days . All you do is make sure you put birth-control pills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women will be thrown into has no precedent outside of itself . Consider that the first lady must run a 123-room house and keep it spotlessly clean though thousands of strangers will be streaming through it almost every day . She will have to be able to run a domestic staff of 90 persons , all of whom must adjust to exceptional working conditions : At certain times every day , bomb-hunting dogs are run through the White House to see if any of those strangers left something a little explosive to be remembered by . ( The White House has one man whose sole duty is to clean and polish the crystal chandeliers and to get the fingerprints off the windows . All the antique furniture is polished every day  --  with lemon oil , not wax . And some of the rugs are vacuumed up to six times a day : Mrs. Eisehower got so upset at seeing footprints in the deeply piled rugs that she ordered the staff to back out of a room at night , on their hands and knees if necessary , to brush out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights at night . ) With all those rooms , the first lady must recognize there 's still a shortage of storage space . ( For a long while , the logs for the 28 fireplaces in the White House were stored in what was originally intended to be the president 's bomb shelter . ) She must plan the family 's clothing carefully , if only for a few days in advance : Historically , there has been so little closet space in the president 's quar-ters on the second floor of the White House that most of the seasonal and seldom-worn items must be stored away on the third and fourth floors . ( There were no walk-in closets in the president 's quarters for the first 152 years of the existence of the White House , at least until the remodeling of the building was finished in 1952 . ) She must also help plan menus with an eye to extraordinary costs , not only for the receptions ( where coffee and finger sandwiches are written off at a total cost of $12 a cup ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but for her own family : The president , like any of us , must pay for the food that he and his family eat . ( President Carter found himself paying for as many as 30 to 36 meals a day whenever all of his children , his mother , his in-laws and his grandson were in the White House , and he quickly began looking around for cost-cutting systems . He might have taken lessons from Mamie Eisenhower : She worked so hard at saving and using leftovers and at finding bargains in the newspaper grocery ads that she managed to get her family 's personal food budget in the White House  --  aside from functions of state  --  down to $25 a week . But then , of course , her husband managed to keep inflation so thoroughly under control that it was n't wiping out anybody 's food budget . ) And with all this , the first lady must cope with her personal problems . Jackie Kennedy had a husband who " entertained " a number of other women whenever she left town ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know it . Betty Ford gradually began to succumb to drugs and to alcohol . Mrs. William McKinley lost the two most important men in her life  --  her husband and her brother  --  to murderers and , even during her White House years , suffered from epilepsy . Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt suggested that she found her supreme fulfillment in her work , yet we know now that the greatest passion of her White House years was another woman , to whom she wrote five and six and seven terribly passionate letters a day . Beyond all this , there is another burden for each woman who wants to enter the White House : Her mate becomes married to his job  --  and to his supposed destiny . The woman in his life often becomes an appendage , something he needs to display , not something he needs to have . As his time , his attention and his energy are consumed by politics , the importance  --  and the self-esteem  --  of the women of his life are reduced . Think of the problems faced by Joy Baker : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dirksen of Illinois , for a long time the minority leader of the Senate  --  and she is the wife of another politician  --  Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee , currently the minority leader and a candidate for the GOP nomination for president . Her father  --  who harbored very real presidential and vice presidential ambitions for himself  --  bowed to the attention demands of his wife , if not his daughter . His wife would simply spend one day of every week completely and totally in bed ; she expected others to wait on her hand and foot on that day . Joy could not  --  as a young girl  --  quite duplicate that for grabbing the attention of her father . But she did get an unexpected attention from her husband-to-be the first time they met . It was on an occasion when he caught her smoking a cigar in the back seat of a car with his younger sister . He was so outraged that he accused Joy of corrupting his sister and , she says , dragged her out of the car and threw her into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know her so well  --  if largely through his sisters  --  that he turned up suddenly in Washington to apologize and to ask for her hand in marriage . At that time . Joy did not know she was going to be passed from one politician to another  --  from one man aching to be president to another . Her father had been elected to the Senate in 1950 ? though he 'd first been elected to Congress in 1932 ? and her husband was elected to the Senate in 1966 . Joy 's life promptly became complicated by their mutual obsession  --  politics  --  and by the occasional struggles between father and husband . In Baker 's first term , they split on an issue dear to Senator Dirksen : the older man 's efforts to overthrow the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision on one-man one-vote . Though a Republican like Dirksen , young Baker not only stood up to his father-in-law but led the parliamentary maneuvering which defeated Dirksen ( who had not only learned the innards of congressional manuevering since his first election to Congress some 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time he 'd become minority leader ten years earlier ) . The difficulty was not in these differences alone so much as in the life-long frustration of trying to establish herself as a woman-worthyof-attention when the men in her life had politics on their minds . " Politics nullified my personality , " she once said . " 1 always felt I was sort of an appendage . ' ' She compensated by turning to alcohol . Heavily . Compulsively . For years and years . " Howard went through hell during that time , " one friend has said . " When he was out of town , he was always worried that she might pass out with a cigarette in her hand and set the house on fire . Or go out drunk and have an accident in the car . " His was the problem of every person whose spouse drinks too much : " He never knew what he was coming home to . " Then one day in 1976 , Joy quit . Pretty much on her own . Her children helped enormously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instead of spending their summers tending to their own desires they came home to make a gift of their attention to their mother . It worked : Joy has not been troubled by alcohol since . The normal difficulties of being the woman-of-theman is not just that he 's more interested in politics ; it 's that his political associates are spectacularly not interested in her . Simply put , they want her to stay out of their lives and their work . Arthur Finkelstein , a pollster for right-wing Republicans , has one all-important rule  --  he never accepts a phone call from the wife of a candidate . " The ideal candidate , " echoes Mark Shields , a consultant for Democratic candidates , " is a man whose wife has disappeared on a trip up the Amazon . " This attitude is particularly hard on a woman if she happens to be bright and personable and honest and outspoken  --  like Keke Anderson , the wife of GOP presidential candidate John Anderson . Last spring she was at a trade fair in Chicago , and Anderson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which was enough to attract voters and repel staffers . " She called one of the candidates speaking at the same function a crook , " says one staffer . " She called Reagan a nut and Phil Crane a Fascist " ? and she was n't quite so complimentary to a long-deposed GOP governor of Illinois because he once had a chance to appoint her husband to the U.S. Senate and he made an absolutely disgraceful choice of a political hack instead . In short , politicians look on her assets as a human as being a total liability . Her problem , says one , is that she cares so much about the man that she married . " She thinks John is the greatest , and while that 's wonderful in a wife , she gets into arguments trying to defend him against every charge that 's made . And you just ca n't be that thin-skinned . " When the women are n't being put down by the professional politicians , they are being exploited in one way or another . Mrs. Carter is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jimmy Carter has something that his rivals for the Democratic nomination may lack  --  a wife who is devoted to him and his work . Indeed , Rosalynn Carter is being used to suggest , by her very appearance on the campaign trail , the problems that Ted Kennedy has had with women in much of his life . But Joan Kennedy is also a symbol . The Kennedy staffers hope that her campaign relationship with the Senator will demonstrate that Ted Kennedy does have an interest in women other than as a sex target . The fact that he is " right " on every public issue  --  in the minds of some people in the women 's movement  --  somehow has not obscured the suspicion , even among them , that Ted 's interest in women pretty much begins and ends with sex . They note that at no time in his 17 years in the Senate did he have a woman high on his staff or in his inner policy-making councils ( while Jimmy Carter has appointed more women to high positions in government and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they discovered to their enormous chagrin that the best-paid women on Senator Kennedy 's staff were earning only about one-third of what the best-paid men were earning ( taking the five best-paid in each category , it came out to roughly $60,000 on the average for the men and $22,000 on the average for the women ) . His difficulty is said by some to be that he can not see the human dimensions of the woman he 's with . That 's why  --  say certain of his critics  --  he drove his wife Joan to alcoholism . And why he drove Mary Jo Kopechne to her death . Joan 's function this year is to symbolize to the public that  --  whatever his past performance  --  Senator Kennedy now has a perception of women that goes beyond his sexual needs . In time , Joan Kennedy may turn out to be  --  in her way  --  the biggest success of this campaign year . For she has done more than make a comeback from alcoholism . She has shown how a woman in her 40s  --  burdened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , by the temptations of alcohol , and by intense public scrutiny  --  can pull herself together and fashion a life that gives her a sense of fulfillment . It is all the more impressive when you consider how complex her problem was . For Joan Kennedy is one of those extraordinarily beautiful women  --  the most beautiful decoration that any of the Kennedy boys gathered , according to friends and family  --  who was afflicted with a very vulnerable self-esteem . She was always a shy person . In high school she rarely dated , and even after she married Ted she sometimes felt that her younger sister , Candy  --  who was , she felt , more popular , more beautiful , and the " special " girl in her family  --  should have married him . Everything came together to accentuate the fragile self-esteem . Washington and its ambience  --  as a place of low standards and high self-esteem  --  was terribly destructive . Her problem was that of any political wife  --  that of learning to put aside the high standards and glowing values that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low , vicious , backstabbing nonperformance of Washington . It is not just that poor quality permeates government ; it is that poor quality permeates everything in Washington . It is that gap in values  --  not just the mindless stupidities of the federal government  --  that separates " Washington " from the rest of the country . Consider the impact on a woman 's value system when she sees the man she loves prosper joyously in this atmosphere , and be celebrated and even cherished in Washington for having reached the top of this rather sordid society . After all , when Joan Kennedy first settled in Washington , one of her brothers-in-law was president , the other was attorney general , and her own husband was a senator . When she sees those she loves and admires succeeding in a place of such poor values , a woman of low self-esteem is likely to say : " What 's wrong with me ? " Instead of saying : " What 's wrong with them ? " Or , " What 's wrong with this phony city ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman has a series of miscarriages upon entering a family which prides itself for being as fecund as rabbits . All the more so when her mate goes on to make so public and persistent a point of having a series of " romances " with other women . " People ask whether the stories about Ted and his ' girls ' hurt my feelings , " Joan said to a friend a couple of years ago . " Of course they hurt my feelings . They went to the core of my self-esteem . " One common way to escape the feeling of battered self-esteem is through alcohol . ( " I found out alcohol could sedate me , " said Joan . " So I did n't care as much . And things did n't hurt so much . " ) The fascinating thing is that Joan responded to tests of her being and her values by giving up alcohol . On one occasion she quit drinking for three months when she was asked to play Mozart with a symphony orchestra ; she has a vast affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could not perform up to her own standards unless her mind was completely clear . On another occasion she gave up drinking when she learned that her son , Teddy Jr. , then 12 years old , had cancer and had to have a leg amputated . But when the moment of the test passed and she sank back into the day-to-day morass of Washington , she went back to drinking . In time , Joan realized that she had to change permanently  --  that she had to give up alcohol altogether . She tried several medical approaches and they helped . She also came to realize that she would have to change the style , tone and amplitude of her life in order to give it order and fulfillment . That meant moving away from Washington and its corrosive demands on the mind and spirit . That meant moving away from Teddy because he would n't move away from Washington . So she moved to Boston  --  where , after all , the Kennedys have their roots and he could logically come to visit  --  and she plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graduate degree in music and she got a job teaching it . She also joined Alcoholics Anonymous and arranged to get psychiatric counseling at least once a week . And finally , she concentrated on re-establishing her standards and her personal self-esteem . The whole approach worked : In May she will get her graduate degree in music and in June she will have passed her third year without alcohol . She is strong enough within herself to campaign with Ted Kennedy  --  she started in December  --  and to live with him in the White House if he wins . She is not out to punish him or to deny him a political success for his past activities . She is more interested in the positive than the negative aspects of her life ; she is still focusing on giving order and balance and fulfillment to her own life rather than denial to another 's life . ( " He could n't run without me and he would n't . " ) If she does enter the White House , she would not revert to the past but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to young children as a way of seeking further personal fulfillment . She also knows that the lady living in the White House is insulated from the deplorable standards of the community outside . The First Lady does not respond to other 's standards ; she sets her own standards . It will be a test of Joan Kennedy , of course , but she has always responded well to tests of a certain kind . The fact is that it will be a test for any woman . Indeed , it might be as severe a test  --  albeit in an entirely different way  --  for Nancy Reagan . For she will face a flourishing antagonism , a screeching demand that she change certain of her standards . For the word is already out : She is a very reserved , almost patrician lady who does not care too much for politics or politicians . " I did say that I wished he Ronald Reagan , her husband would get out of politics , " she admitted not long ago . " And I meant it . " But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ronald Reagan . Nancy Reagan will face a common problem : She is seen through two prisms  --  one based on human standards , the other based on political ones . The human dimension suggests that she is a warm and devoted woman with a marvelous sense of humor . Not everybody sees her that way . Other people feel she is cold and aloof and a social climber . " Nancy 's like an electric light bulb , " says one friend , a politician . " She 's either on or off . When she 's on , she 's incandescent . She can charm the smallest birds from the tallest trees . But she does n't turn it on casual- Because she does n't , she is seen with a particular prejudice by the political community . She is , in fact , a perfectly coiffed , somewhat petite woman  --  she wears a size 6 dress  --  who has an aristrocratic manner and an ill-concealed disdain for politicians and all their works and all their pomps . When her husband was governor of California , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of the capital 's politicos  --  flee to her " tony " friends in Los Angeles . Certain politicians would like very much to separate Nancy from her husband and use her only as an occasional symbol , in the classic tactic of disposing of wives-of-candidates . That is n't going to work with the Reagans ; they are far closer than politicians could ever anticipate . " Any time , " says Reagan , " something happens , the first thing that comes to my mind is how I 'm going to tell her about it . " Indeed , some politicians suspect that their first concern should not be how they 're going to get Nancy out of the way but whether she is going to get them out of the way . One reporter remembers being in Governor Reagan 's office when Nancy phoned to say that she just heard California 's finance director take a slightly different position on a public issue when speaking in Los Angeles than Reagan did in a statement in Sacramento . She apparently felt that the office holder was insubordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a little more about the nitty-gritty of politics than does Nancy  --  though he does n't care for it much more  --  knew that it was not insubordination ; it was incompetence : Nobody had worked it out so that the statements were the same . Thus Reagan was able to dissuade her from her intent , but he did not erase the impression that she could reshape the Cabinet of her husband if she so desired . The fact is that Nancy Reagan may  --  however much she dislikes politicians  --  have been the central influence on Ronald Reagan 's choice of political philosophy . For she was an extreme conservative long before he was ; her stepfather , Dr. Loyal Davis , was as celebrated in Chicago for his wealth and his right-wing politics as he was for his medical skills . It was n't so easy being an extreme conservative in Nancy 's youth ; it was far more chic to be a Roosevelt liberal  --  a New Dealer . That 's what Ronald Reagan was . He was a " bleeding heart liberal , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He worked hard at his liberalism . He rose to become head of the actors ' labor union , the Screen Actors Guild , and he joined every possible liberal organization from the American Veterans Committee to the United World Federalists ( which advocated a form of world government ) to the Hollywood Independent Committee of the Arts , Sciences , and Professions ( which he , among others , concluded was dominated by communists ) . After many years of membership and activity in left-wing organizations , he resigned from most of them ( though not from his labor union , of course ) because he felt they had strayed from his concepts of Americanism . There was never any doubt that Reagan himself was strongly anti-communist , even when he considered himself a strenuous liberal . Interestingly , it was his know-how in some of these organizations that got him together with Nancy . Reagan had been married once  --  to Jane Wyman in 1940 . They had two children and were divorced in 1948 . Miss Wyman said it was because he was devoting so much attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years later , Reagan got a call from a Hollywood director named Mervyn LeRoy , not to get Reagan into a film but to enlist Reagan 's help as president of the Screen Actors Guild . LeRoy had a friend  --  a young actress  --  with a particular kind of problem . She was a very conservative young woman who kept getting mail from extreme left-wing organizations and who found herself mentioned in a Hollywood newspaper on a list of people who had  --  she was to say later ? " rather exotic political feelings . " The Hollywood witch hunts were over at the time , though Hollywood did n't know it . But the nation was sliding deep into the McCarthy fear era , in which anybody 's career or life might be destroyed by an accusation  --  however false  --  that one was a communist or a communist sympathizer . This young woman , said LeRoy , was an actress under contract to MGM ; one assertion that she was a communist or a communist sympathizer  --  even though the assertion was false  --  would doom her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plead that she was indeed a conservative ; the mere fact that she was on left-wing mailing lists and that her name was printed in public as being associated with leftwingers would convict her ; she would be guilty by association . Mervyn LeRoy asked : Could Reagan check to see if there was anything at the offices of the Screen Actors Guild that would suggest how she got on these lists ? Was it possible that somebody was trying to frame her ? That would be no defense in a public hearing against a red-hunting Joe McCarthy ; he knew all there was to know about frame-ups . But at least it would give her a place to start in trying to defend herself . Reagan did as LeRoy asked . He went through the files and found ab solutely nothing to link Nancy Davis with these left-wing organizations . Indeed , he found that her name might have been confused with that of another woman . He passed his findings on to Mervyn LeRoy . The latter thanked him and asked one more favor : " Take her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been some suggestion that there was more than one concern behind this matter . It may not have been just the menace of communism that moved Nancy Davis but the threat of single blessedhood . Nancy has never quite conceded the point but she admits that the prospect of having somebody call Ronald Reagan to get him involved with her and her problems " was a dandy idea . " In any case , he did take her to dinner . They began dating . And they were married in March 1952 . They have two children and they continued to share many interests in common : Nancy Davis co-starred with Ronald Reagan in the last movie he ever made  --  Hellcats of the Navy in 1956 . But the eventual change was in Ronnie , not Nancy . He adopted Nancy 's political and economic philosophy . It took a while , but he gradually gave up his liberal interests . Ten years after he married Nancy , he gave up his registration in the Democratic party , That was in 1962 . In 1964 , he supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican National Convention . And in 1966 , he was running as a Republican and winning : He became the governor of California . Since then , he has become the most stirring symbol of the extreme right wing in America . And that 's where Nancy came from  --  long , long before Ronald Reagan ever thought of it . The intriguing thing is that personality so often overwhelms politics  --  at least among the women . As the **30;4142;TOOLONG , Nancy Reagan projects the cool , aloof patrician image . Arlene Crane , wife of extremely conservative candidate Phil Crane , is a vivacious , outgoing , bursting-with-opinions woman ( " I 'm even gutsier than Betty Ford " ) who seems to be wooing half the world ( on behalf of her husband ) and making war with the other half . ( One of her targets : her neighbors in a suburb of Washington ? " rotten and full of busybodies . " They had her arrested recently when the Cranes ' pet dog bit a neighbor 's child . ) Arlene is a mother of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy cited earlier  --  who is not going to be quelled by Washington , its pretensions , or its opinions . She turned out to be much stronger than women in Washington were supposed to be . Indeed , she seemed at times to be more driven and gregarious than her husband . " It is almost as if she can carry his political load , " says one acquaintance . Naturally the politicians reacted to Arlene 's personality like quail to the sound of buckshot . She became the issue of the campaign . A newspaper publisher in New England published stories about the sex and drinking life of Arlene and Phil Crane  --  without hard documentation , of course . Then Arlene was accused of being the reason that Crane 's top strategists all resigned from his presidential campaign . One of those strategists was pollster Arthur Finkelstein , who  --  as we have seen  --  does not take phone calls from candidates ' wives . That does not set well with a personality such as Arlene 's . She called Phil 's top campaign workers " punks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow one of them and getting the rest to go along with her . The astonishing thing is that  --  considering the outspokenness of Arlene Crane  --  some women who might be in the White House have flourished in relative anonymity . Here is a political parlor game that is terribly revealing about the multiplicity of candidates in the current campaign . Name this woman : She has been married to the same man for 34 years , she has lived in 17 cities and 28 different homes , she was only the third woman ever to be permitted to visit Tibet , and her husband has already held three of the most critical jobs in the high levels of government : ambassador to the U.N. , head of the U.S. liaison office in China , and director of Central Intelligence ( " He did n't share too much of that CIA job with me , says the woman , Meet the culinary challenge of rice and spaghetti , both , those devils which come up soggy and heavy and gooey even for experienced chefs on occasion when cooked in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice or spaghetti retaining all the natural flavor and nutrients . You 'll be hailed as the masta of the pasta and the spice of the rice ! Four-piece set . capacity 8 quarts , weight 4 ' /2 lbs. , made of heavy-guage aluminum . Price : $22.95 " because I ca n't keep a secret . " ) Her name is Barbara Bush and she is the wife of George Bush , one of the GOP candidates for the nomination . There are those who see a parallel between the Bush campaign and Jim-my Carter 's campaign in 1976 . It placed emphasis on the Iowa caucuses , for example , and on the New Hamp-shire primary . And it was designed to allow the candidate and his wife to campaign separately  --  reaching perhaps twice as many people and generating more media inter-est  --  instead of traveling as a " coosome twosome . " ( On her cam-paign travels , Barbara Bush works on her needlepoint . ) " I wo n't sit in on Cabinet meetings , " she says , " and I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's most important cam-paign aides says that last summer she sat in on " every substantial briefing we had for the candidate " ? listening and " doing her needlepoint . Actually , she did n't say much , but when she did  --  when she looked up from her needlepoint  --  she had very pointed re-marks . Some with humor . Some with a touch of sarcasm . But I do n't think anybody came away from those ses- sions without a great deal of respect for her and for what she contributed . " One of the most significant recrnt developments of the " female " relationship is how it has changed in recent years . For a long time , it was thought that a presidential candidate could not have been involved in a divorce . After he 'd been divorced , Adlai Stevenson got the nomination , but  --  though few media people ever realized it  --  he was not the first to do so . James M.Cox , the Democratic candidate in 1920 , was not only divorced but remarried . Today marital irregularities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dole , the Republican candidate for vice president in 1976 and a candidate for the GOP nomination for the presidency in 1980 , married a young woman who cared for him medically and emotionally while he was wrapped in plaster casts from his wounds in World War II . She went on to support him while he went through college and law school and she campaigned with him to get him into the Senate . But once he was there , he became more absorbed in politics and in " destiny . " The Doles went through a somewhat difficult divorce in the early 1970s and Bob later remarried . His second wife , Elizabeth , was a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission , so he did not really lose a wife in the legal proceedings so much as gain a second income . ( Elizabeth has since left the FTC and is now working on Dole 's campaign . ) The point is that divorce is no longer a bar to getting into the White House . After all , Ronald Reagan was also divorced and remarried . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of whether not being married is a drawback . The Republicans had a bachelor candidate  --  Larry Pressler , the senator from South Dakota . So did the Democrats  --  in a way . Governor Jerry Brown of California is single , but he has carried on a romance on an international scale with rock-and-roll singer Linda Ronstadt . ( " He was just getting experience in foreign affairs , " says one sarcastic staffer for a rival candidate for the Democratic nomination . ) As it developed , Governor Brown was as elusive on the issue of whether he'dmarry his rock-and-roll star before he moved into the White House as he was on most other issues . But he clearly made another decision about the women in his life : He did n't have his rock-and-roll singer campaigning for him across America , but he did have his mother making appearances for him . Perhaps to prove he had other feminine resources . The fact is that his mother is a fascinating woman . But so are all the other women who might enter the White House next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is anything to be learned from the long , trying , sometimes wacky , sometimes ugly process of this particular election campaign , it is that the women who are involved are far more interesting than the men .
