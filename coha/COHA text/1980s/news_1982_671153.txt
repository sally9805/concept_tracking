Across town , in the hushed atmosphere of a Lenox Hill Hospital room , John Davidson rooted for the Rangers last night , too . That ' s probably all he will be able to do for them this season . The 29-yearold goaltender , a favorite of teammates and fans alike , found out yesterday that he must undergo spinal surgery tomorrow. // According to Dr. Norman Scott , Davidson should be able to play again after he recovers . He said the surgery should correct , once and for all , the back injuries that caused Davidson to miss all but two games last season. // " Peace of mind is the biggest thing now , " said Davidson , who reinjured his back in practice 10 days ago . " At least I know what the prognosis is , and I know I can play again . I ' m not going to throw in the towel - no way . I ' m coming back to work. " // Dr. Scott said that a myelogram test yesterday showed a disk protrusion pressing on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excised , he said . Another test , called a discogram , will be performed today to see if another level of disk also must be removed . <> <> Goalies Have Work // Last night , Davidson must have felt sympathy for both goaltenders . Although the Rangers won , Steve Weeks saw his goals-against average suffer unnecessarily as his teammates built a 6-2 lead but then allowed Calgary two late goals. // Meanwhile , Don Edwards of Calgary did everything in the first period to keep his team in contention , fending off 21 of 23 Ranger shots to hold New York to a 2-1 lead. // " We knew they played the Islanders the night before us and maybe they ' d be tired , so we thought if we could really take it to them in the first period , it ' d go our way the rest of the night , " said Mike Rogers , who assisted on the first two Ranger goals and scored the third. // First Rogers set up the 100th goal of Anders Hedberg ' s 255-game National Hockey League career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed Don Maloney in front of Edwards for a power-play goal and a 2-0 lead . Calgary got a power-play goal from Greg Meredith near the end of the first period , then tied the score when Paul Reinhart scored early in the second. // At that point the Rangers tightened control , and reeled off four straight goals . Rogers scored midway through the second period , and near the end of the period Don Maloney scored his second of the night . Then Mark Pavelich and Nick Fotiu scored just 55 seconds apart early in the third period . <> <> A Give and Go // Maloney ' s second goal delighted the crowd . After taking Ed Johnstone ' s pass , Robbie Ftorek raced into Calgary ' s zone down the left side , with Maloney skating hard on the right . In the left circle , Ftorek faked a slap shot - then quickly whisked the puck toward Maloney , who was a few feet from Edwards. // " Donnie directed it onto the goalie ' s pads , then got the rebound and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two goals in his first 10 games , so last night was a relief to him . But it was no surprise to his linemates . " He just got some confidence back , and that ' s all he needed , " said Johnstone . " He ' s preparing very well before the game , mentally , " said Ftorek . <> <> Failure on the Road // The Flames were not well prepared . Last night was their third game on a five-game road trip and five players were ill with the flu . They have yet to win on the road and are 0-5-2. // Beck , who wore No. 5 for the first time in his Ranger career , the number Carol Vadnais had until he went to the New Jersey Devils , had two assists , his first two of the season . He has one goal. // Pavelich continued his steady output by scoring his sixth goal . He has scored at least one point in nine of 11 games this season . <> <> Penguins 7 , Capitals 5 // PITTSBURGH ( AP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penguins . The left wing scored in each period as he registered his second three-goal game of the season after going through eight N.H.L. seasons without a hat trick. // The Capitals ' Darren Veitch , a defenseman , will be sidelined indefinitely after breaking a collarbone in three places during the first period when he was checked into the boards by Paul Baxter. // Boutette and Rick Kehoe scored power-play goals 16 seconds apart late in the first period to give the Penguins a 3-1 lead . <> <> Oilers 4 , Black Hawks 4 // EDMONTON , Alberta ( UPI ) - Glenn Anderson and Jari Kurri scored to cap a third-period comeback , lifting Edmonton to the tie . Trailing , 4-2 , after Al Secord ' s goal at 8 : 09 , Anderson narrowed the gap with his second goal of the game at 12 : 05 , catching the Chicago goalie , Tony Esposito , out of position with a 10-footer .

MacLean got the Jets off to a quick start , backhanding a pass to a linemate , Brian Mullen , while lying prone on the ice . Mullen beat the Los Angeles goaltender , Gary Laskoski , with a high shot at 2 : 40 . Just 74 seconds later , Smail tapped his own rebound past Laskoski to make it 2-0. // The Kings bounced back at 9 : 01 when Dave Taylor skated around a defenseman , Dave Babych , and put a backhander past the goalie , Doug Soetaert .
