Medics and debriefers are also waiting anxiously <P> With its 20 white concrete buildings , 235 beds and 844 staff members , the U.S. Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden , West Germany , is the biggest and best-equipped American military medical facility in Europe . While it is prepared for anything from hangnails to heart surgery , the hospital expects to be confronted soon with an unusually delicate task : receiving and caring for the 52 American hostages during their first critical days of freedom . " Officially , we do n't even know they 're coming here , " says a senior member of the hospital staff . " Unofficially , we 've been ready to process and treat these people since last November . " <P> At Rhein-Main air base 25 miles away , two white C-9A Nightingale hospital planes are on 24-hour stand-by to fly to any European or North African destination to pick up the precious passengers . By every means that can be foreseen , from both a medical and psychological point of view , the way is being smoothed for the hostages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning for the hostages ' reception : " The first hours , even the first two days , are a very delicate time . They should be free of any pressures . They need to take a deep , long breath . " <P> Preliminary medical examinations will probably be carried out aboard the C-9As en route to Wiesbaden . After arrival at the hospital , those who do not need immediate attention will be given complete physicals , undergoing tests for , as the hospital puts it , " everything from tapeworm to tuberculosis . " Extensive psychological testing will also take place . <P> Finally , the hostages will be debriefed on the details of their ordeal-kindly but thoroughly-by a number of intelligence interrogators . The nature of the debriefing will depend on the individual hostages and the circumstances of their release . If all the hostages are released at once , for example , debriefing will have less urgency . If there is only a partial release , the freed hostages will be quickly questioned to determine the condition and location of the remaining captives . The higher-ranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own full analytic reports about their captivity . <P> Having consulted with a broad spectrum of medical experts , U.S. officials want to postpone family reunions until after the hostages have gone through a " decompression period . " Explains one of the psychologists who helped formulate the plan : " A family reunion , as long sought after as it may be , creates certain burdens . An emotional performance is required that the hostages may need some time to work up to . " Some hostage families , however , are reportedly planning to fly to Wiesbaden despite official appeals to hold off . The Wiesbaden stopover is expected to take from three days to a week , depending on the hostages ' condition . After that they will be flown to Washington to meet with their families , and only then will they be welcomed with what is sure to be an effusive display of official national honors.
