Even having seen the right ballet , you may still have missed the reel . . . . Danced by the corps de ballet , it comes at a dramatic moment , when the sylph of the title is trying to lure the hero James away from his bride-to-be. // I overlooked the reel several times . But now that I have danced that reel - and in the company of professional dancers - I feel that I own a few steps of ' ' La Sylphide , ' ' and the next time I watch the ballet , it will be with a proprietary interest in the reel. // // How I as a nondancer came to dance the reel requires a little digression into dance history. // The original version of ' ' La Sylphide ' ' premiered in Paris in 1832 , and it was memorable as the first ballet in which the ballerina danced an entire role calling for pointwork. // The version we know today , however , is Danish . Produced in Copenhagen by the Royal Danish Ballet , it celebrates 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Danes ' major contribution to the international ballet repertoire. // The very essence of the early Romantic movement in Europe is captured in ' ' La Sylphide ' ' - the longing for faraway places and unattainable ideals , combined with folkloristic color , which in this case is the reel . The ballet also represents a style of dance and a school of training that were developed in Paris and that have been preserved to this day in Copenhagen . It is a style in which repose of the head , arms , and torso contrasts with continuous virtuosic footwork , quick changes of direction , and sudden leaps which seem effortless . With no pause for bows , the dance line serves a dramatic context and never the dancer ' s personality. // The creator of ' ' La Sylphide ' ' was August Bournonville , the Danish-born son of a French ballet dancer who settled in Copenhagen and became director of the Royal Danish Ballet. // Following truly in his father ' s footsteps , young Bournonville completed his own ballet training at the Paris Opera and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a solo dancer . Returning to Copenhagen where he , too , became director of the ballet , Bournonville wanted to produce ' ' La Sylphide ' ' - not least of all to showcase his own dancing. // Lacking funds to rent the original musical score from Paris , Bournonville commissioned a new one from a Danish composer and made changes in both the scenario and the choreography . He didn ' t avoid charges of plagiarism but he created a work that history has validated. // Hans Christian Andersen , a lifelong friend and artistic colleague of Bournonville , wrote scenarios for several of his ballets . Bournonville ' s father had rejected the teen-age Andersen as an aspirant to the ballet , and it was in August Bournonville ' s home , years later , that Andersen met and fell in love with the Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind - who also rejected him . Andersen did , however , have the satisfaction of seeing his fairy tales translated and known throughout Europe , whereas Bournonville ' s ballets were largely unknown outside Denmark during his life. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' starring Danny Kaye , Hollywood offered a charming , if fictionalized , biography . It did , however , include one authentic and auspicious touch - a young Danish dancer named Erik Bruhn , who partnered French ballerina Zizi Jeanmaire in a three-minute sequence. // The following year , 1953 , Bruhn vaulted to international stardom as James in a London performance of ' ' La Sylphide . ' ' He was to become the definitive James and the definitive male dancer of his generation . He was also the first of a wave of young dancers to leave the Royal Danish Ballet , bringing Bournonville ' s style and repertoire to a worldwide audience and eventually becoming directors of six major com-panies. // The Soloists of the Royal Danish Ballet , a touring group formed 10 years ago in Copenhagen , have also earned wide acclaim in Bournonville works , during summer tours of Europe , Asia , and North America . Two years ago , while performing at the Matrix : Midland Festival in Michigan , they established the Bournonville Summer Academy to introduce their dance heritage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midland to focus on ' ' La Sylphide ' s ' ' sesquicentennial , with classes in the ballet ' s solos , mime sequences - and the reel. // Soloists Anne-Marie Vessel and Flemming Ryberg ( himself a notable James ) taught the reel , graciously asking each observer to lay aside notebook and pencil and join the dancers for three sessions . Not until the last day did we learn that they were including us in the evening ' s gala finale. // ' ' Before dinner we entertain you , ' ' explained Flemming . ' ' After dinner - you entertain us . ' ' When he put it that way , how could we decline ? // Twelve couples were too many to teach on the stage at one time , so we had learned the reel in two separate classes , without seeing the completed formation until the ' ' performance. ' ' // I was depending on my partner , dance critic and lecturer Erik Aschengreen , to lunge emphatically at the proper moments . But Erik had been practicing with a dancer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me. // From the dinner table , mime instructor Niels-Bjorn Larsen rushed over to partner me , and as I put my hand on his shoulder to begin , I heard him murmur , ' ' I haven ' t danced this for 20 years . . . . ' ' And sure enough , where I needed him , he turned and went the wrong way. // In the grand right and left , Ole Norlyng , the Danes ' music history lecturer , made his customary charge for Erik , who was not in the very front of the formation . Ole ' s maneuver led three couples into uncharted territory , scrambling the rest of us . By the time the music reached its final ' ' da-dum , thrumm - DUM , ' ' there were 24 dancers in search of a pattern , and the Danes were doubled over in laughter. // Flemming finally raised his hands and summoned us back . ' ' All right , you have rehearsed . Now you can dance it. ' ' // And we did . Shorn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and the pattern of the reel guide us through our rows and turns and circles and gather us home to our partners . With arms raised in the final triumphant flourish , we faced the applause of the Soloists of the Royal Danish Ballet. // //
