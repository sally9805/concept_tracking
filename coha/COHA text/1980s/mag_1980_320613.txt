An epidemic of skyjackings <P> It seems a throwback to the air piracy of the late 1960s , when skyjackings steered dozens of planes to Cuba . The motive now , as it often was then , is homesickness . Last week six commercial U.S. airliners were hijacked and forced to fly to Havana , apparently by Cuban refugees who had come to the U.S. on the recent Freedom Flotilla . First , a Key Westbound Air Florida 737 with 33 people aboard was commandeered by a Spanish-speaking man wielding a " bomb " that turned out to be a box containing a bar of soap . Next , another Air Florida 737 , headed from Key West to Miami with 74 aboard , was seized by seven passengers who threatened to ignite a bottle of gasoline . Then , a National Airlines DC-10 bound for Puerto Rico was forced to Havana by two Spanish-speaking men who also threatened to set the plane on fire . <P> On Saturday alone , three planes were forcibly detoured to Cuba : an Eastern Air Lines 727 en route to Orlando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlando ; and a Delta Air Lines widebody L-1011 , flying from Puerto Rico to Los Angeles with 165 aboard . In the first three cases , the passengers were unharmed and the planes were allowed to return to the U.S. ; the fate of passengers and planes in the last three was unresolved at week 's end . The second seizure provided a clue to the common motivation , after a would-be member of the hijack gang was arrested at Key West and explained how they felt . " They were very despondent , " said FBI Agent Bill Hayes , " mostly because they missed their families . "
