What brought these aspiring thespians to Scotland ' s capital was its famed Edinburgh International Festival , an annual three-week cultural extravaganza that adds up to one of the largest gatherings of performing artists in the world. // The 42-year-old festival sits upon the brow of this serene Georgian capital a wee bit like a lampshade perched atop the giddy visage of a normally proper descendant of Robert Burns. // Not that anyone goes so far as to call Edinburgh , with its soot-caked buildings and polished cobblestone byways , the Hollywood of the North . But every August , this Scottish metropolis , whose bracing spirit seems to spring from equal parts Protestantism and porridge , becomes a mecca for thousands of performers - from student actors to established international stars. // // ' Macbeth ' over breakfast // ' ' Oh , do pop along to the show , ' ' implored one festival performer , waving a promotional banner that read : ' ' Shakespeare for breakfast - good morning , Macbeth - 40 minutes of love and death washed down by coffee and croissants. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in his Scottish brogue , ' ' I ' m one of the actors , and I can tell you , it ' s brilliant. ' ' // Indeed , in this less-than-stellar season , nothing distinguished the festival so much as the hyperbole of aspiration. // The event is really two enormous festivals in one - the official version and the unofficial ' ' Fringe ' ' ( not to mention concurrent film , television , and jazz festivals ) . // ' ' On an average day you could choose among 350 programs , ' ' said Mhairi Mackenzie-Robinson , administrator of the Fringe festival . ' ' And that ' s just the Fringe . On a really busy day , between the two festivals you could choose 500 events. ' ' // Tot up all the 1988 offerings , and you get nearly 500 companies on hand here , more than 900 shows offered , and some 10 , 000 performances. // These ranged from such main-festival companies as the Scottish National Orchestra and the Houston Grand Opera performing in theaters and concert halls to bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basements , Masonic lodges , even inside cars . Festival lore has it that a program was once mounted in a hole in the ground. // This year , one of the hottest Fringe tickets was ' ' Rod Quantock ' s Bus , ' ' in which audience members accompanied Mr. Quantock on a motorbus tour around the city , assisting the Australian comedian in his ' ' invasion ' ' of various ports of call , including Edinburgh ' s RAS Club Men ' s Bar. // In the main festival , the scope has unquestionably broadened through the efforts of its artistic director , Frank Dunlop , and his predecessor , John Drummond . Both sought to popularize the event , which until recent years was music-based and top-heavy with superstars like Placido Domingo , Maria Callas , Yehudi Menuhin , and Mstislav Rostropovich. // The last few seasons have presented a more varied , if quirkier , roster of artists , including stage troupes like Poland ' s Staya Theater of Krakow , South Africa ' s Market Theater of Johannesburg , Ireland ' s Abbey Theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local and London press have suggested it was the need to make ends meet that has forced Mr. Dunlop , who arrived in 1983 , to re-tailor the festival to popular tastes . Even though Edinburgh ' s District Council , which supplies one-sixth of the festival ' s budget , has pledged a new three-year funding package to circumvent the annual wrangling over money , one-third of the festival ' s $5. 1 million budget has to be earned from ticket sales. // Overall festival attendance this year remained steady at a healthy 70 percent of capacity . But the British critics were devastating . They called the overall lineup little short of disaster . In the theatrical realm , they deemed only one of the productions an unqualified hit - the British premiere of the Houston Grand Opera production of John Adams ' s ' ' Nixon in China. ' ' // Dunlop , however , said their reaction was rubbish , citing some 3 , 000 attendees for that premiere alone . ' ' That would never happen in London , ' ' he countered. // Nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard appears to have reached a crescendo . Several of them are calling for the removal of Dunlop and his populist artistic agenda . They want a return to the high-caliber fare of festivals gone by. // Launched in 1947 by opera impresario Rudolf Bing , the festival has reigned as one of the world ' s most prestigious international gatherings of artists . The corresponding , if cheekily unofficial , Fringe festival - comprised of hundreds of comedy and cabaret acts and avant-garde theater performances - supplements the official festival , which was dominated by its musical side for most of its first three decades. // Under Dunlop ' s predecessor , John Drummond , and increasingly since Dunlop ' s arrival , the number of Fringe events has increased markedly , and the official program has moved away from its musical underpinnings toward more theater. // Referring to this year ' s edition , Owen Dudley-Edwards , a history and theater professor at Edinburgh University and a contributor to a city daily , The Scotsman , said , ' ' This is not a neck-sticking-out kind of festival . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival than it was during the 1960s , the heyday of snob opera. ' ' // Sampling the ' world theater ' program // My own sampling of the event tends to confirm that this is , indeed , a festival in need of better direction and renewed artistic vision. // The core productions were in the so-called ' ' world theater ' ' program . These included Japan ' s Ninagawa Theatre Company performing a Noh-inspired version of Shakespeare ( ' ' The Tempest ' ' ) ; West Germany ' s Schiller Theatre Company performing a French classic ( Offenbach ' s ' ' La Perichole ' ' ) ; the Paris-based Argentine troupe , Group TSE , performing an 18th-century French play ( Marivaux ' s ' ' Le Jeu de l ' Amour et du Hasard ' ' ) ; a troupe of Cree Indians from Canada satirizing reservation life ( ' ' The Rez Sisters ' ' ) ; and the Americans performing the Adams opera . Italy ' s scheduled Peppe e Barra troupe didn ' t show up. // Too many of the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By festival ' s end , the body count of fatally flawed productions - the lone exceptions being the Ninagawa Company and ' ' Nixon in China ' ' - was at record levels . Of the seven festival productions seen by this writer , the only other one that seemed worthy of festival status was the Group TSE ' s animal-masked version of the Marivaux play. // On the boisterous and uncensored Fringe , the ambience was less like a cultural rite than a trade show , in which thousands of on-the-way-up performers hoped to win a nod from one of a growing number of visiting producers. // ' ' I came to Edinburgh specifically to meet a TV producer , ' ' said London-based comic Malcom Hardee. // ' ' This is a convention that everyone must do , ' ' said Harold Easton , a veteran of the Fringe and the producing director of the American Festival Theater , a loosely-knit group of US actors performing on the Fringe . ' ' For American actors , it ' s a great experience , but for British performers it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so well known has the Fringe become throughout Britain that many London-based comedians , including Jo Brand and Jeremy Hardy , label their summer shows ' ' Edinburgh Previews . ' ' Amid complaints that comedy had taken over the Fringe ( nearly one-third of this year ' s offerings were either one-man cabaret shows or comedy acts ) , the rewards of being labeled a Fringe hit were considered enormous . The top comedy prize is the coveted Perrier Award , which brings $2 , 550 in prize money and a guaranteed run at London ' s Donmar Warehouse Theatre . Last year ' s winner , Glasgow standup comic Allen Browne , went on to do a series of sell-out performances and a pilot for a TV talk show. // Professional interest in the Fringe isn ' t confined to producers from Britain , however . Talent scouts from comedy festivals in Montreal and Melbourne , as well as from general arts festivals in Dublin and Sydney and from New York ' s Home Box Office cable TV company were spotted in the ' ' Assembly Rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the Assembly Rooms are one of the few Fringe venues with audience capacities large enough for a sellout performer to earn a profit. // With the cost of mounting a Fringe production as high as $17 , 000 , most performers don ' t break even , but they consider the financial loss here an investment in their careers. // ' ' This is the event that all the agents come and see , ' ' said David Glass , a London-based mime and performance artist . ' ' In the three weeks here , I can get bookings for an entire year. ' ' // Despite the growing commercialism of the Fringe and the popularization of the main event - not to mention longstanding complaints from the audience that there ' s too much bad theater and from the performers that there is too small an audience - Edinburgh ' s twin festivals show no signs of flagging. // Indeed , Edinburgh remains perhaps the only place where , after a rousing exhibition by the Pipe and Drum Corp of the Royal Highland Fusiliers at the Royal Tattoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobblestoned Royal Mile to join 30 other drowsy people watching Ian Saville , the ' ' Socialist Conjurer , ' ' performing his ' ' Class Struggle Rope Trick ' ' into the wee hours of the morning. // The mind-boggling variety and the spirit of Edinburgh itself are what keep the festival alive. // ' ' It ' s great to be able to play to ordinary Scottish people who save up all year long to go see theater during the festival , ' ' said Mr. Glass . ' ' Just the other day an Edinburgh woman saw my show and then took me out for a cream tea . Now that was lovely. ' ' // //
