" " Sure , but you said it with a real crappy harpy jealous tone and I know you meant : I hope you had a lousy time ! " Linc was right , Casey thought in misery . If he wants to be out all night that 's up to him . I should have buttoned up like the other times and not made a big deal of it . But this is n't like the other times . He 's in danger and wo n't see it ! " For chrissake , Linc , that woman 's after your money and power and that 's all ! How long have you known her ? A couple of days . Where did you meet her ?

C'm on , Casey , for chrissake ! You 've never been jealous before  --  admit you 're fit to be tied . She 's everything a man could want and you 're . . . She remembered how he had stopped just before he 'd said it . Tears filled her eyes . He 's right , goddamnit ! I 'm not . I 'm a goddamn business machine , not feminine like her , not an easy lay and not interested in being a housewife , at least not yet , and I could never do what she 's done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook , he says , feminine , great body great legs great taste , trained and beddable , Jesus , how beddable . And with no thought in her goddamn head but how to catch a rich husband . The Frenchwoman was right : Line 's a patsy for any no-account , harpy , Asian gold digger , and Orlanda 's the cream of the Hong Kong crop . Shit ! But whatever Linc says , I 'm still right about her and right about Gornt . Or am I ? Let 's face it , I 've nothing to go on but a few rumors , and my own intuition . Orlanda 's got me on the run , I 'm running scared . I made a goddamn mistake letting myself go at Linc . Remember what he said before he left the suite . " From here on in you stay the hell out of my private life ! " Oh God ! There was a fine wind blowing as the ferry skittered across the harbor , engines pounding , sampans and other boats moving nimbly out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she dabbed her tears away , took out her mirror and checked that her mascara was not running . A huge freighter sounded its horn , flags fluttering , and moved majestically past , but she did not see it , nor the immensity of the nuclear carrier tiedp801up alongside the Admiralty Wharf , Hong Kong side . " Get hold of yourself , " she muttered in misery to her mirror image . " Jesus , you look forty . " The cramped wooden benches were crowded and she shifted uncomfortably , jammed between other passengers , most of whom were Chinese , though here and there were camera-heavy tourists and other Europeans . There was not an inch of free space , all gangways clogged , seats clogged , and already blocks of passengers crowded the ramp exit on both decks . The Chinese beside her were awkwardly reading their newspapers as peoplewould on any subway except that , from time to time , they would hawk noisily to clear their throats . One spat . On the bulkhead right in front of him was a large sign in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hawked again and Casey wanted to take his newspaper and thump him with it . The tai-pan 's remark flooded her memory : " We 've been trying to change them for a hundred and twenty-odd years , but Chinese do n't change easily . " It 's not just them , she thought , her head aching . It 's everyone and everything in this man 's world . The tai-pan 's right . So what am I going to do ? About Linc ? Change the rules or not ? I have already . I 've gone over his head with the bail-out scheme . That 's a first . Am I going to tell him about it or not ? Dunross wo n't give me away and Murtagh 'll take all the credit , has to , if First Central 'll buy it . I 'll have to tell Linc sometime . But whether the bail-out works or not , what about Linc and me ? Her eyes were fixed ahead , unseeing , as she tried to decide . The ferry was nearing the Kowloon Terminal berth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirled out of the way for the incomers . Everyone got up and began to jostle for position at the port exit ramp . The ship heeled slightly , unbalanced . Jesus , she thought uneasily , jerked out of her reverie , there must be five hundred of us on each deck . Then she winced as an impatient Chinese matron squeezed past , stomped carelessly on her foot and pushed on through the throng to the head of the line . Casey got up , her foot hurting , wanting to belt the woman with her umbrella . " They 're something else , eh ? " the tall American behind her said with grim good humor . " What ? Oh yes , yes . . . something else , some of them . " People surrounded her , crowding her , pressing too close . Suddenly she felt claustrophobicand sickened . The man sensed it and used his bulk to force a littleroom . Those who were pushed aside gave way with ill humor . " Thanks , " she said , relieved , the nausea gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stanley Rosemont . We met at the tai-pan 's . " Casey turned , startled . " Oh , sorry , I guess . . . I guess I was a million miles away , I did n't . . . sorry . How 's it going ? " she asked , not rememberinghim.  |p802  " More of the same , Casey . " Rosemont looked down at her . " Not so good with you , huh ? " he asked kindly . " Oh I 'm fine . Sure , very fine . " She turned away , self-conscious that he 'd noticed . Sailors were fore and aft and they tossed out guy lines which were instantly caught and dropped over stanchions . The thick ropes screeched under the tension , setting her teeth on edge . As the ferry eased perfectly into its berth , the drawbridge gate began to lower but before it was down completely the crowd was surging off the boat , Casey carried with it . After a few yards the pressure eased and she walked up the ramp at her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to board for Hong Kong side . Rosemont caught up with her . " You at the V and A ? " " Yes , " she said . " You ? " " Oh no ! We 've an apartment Hong Kong side  --  the consulate owns it . " " Have you been here long ? " " Two years . It 's interesting , Casey . After a month or so you feel locked in  --  no place to go , so many people , seeing the same friends day after day . But soon it 's great . Soon you get to feel you 're at the center of the action , the center of Asia where all the action is today . Sure , Hong Kong 's the center of Asia  --  papers 're good , you 've great food , good golf , racing , boating and it 's easy to go to Taipei , Bangkok or wherever . Hong Kong 's okay  --  course it 's nothing like Japan . Japan 's something else . That 's like out of Oz . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're a man . Tough for wives , very tough , and for kids . Your helplessness , your alienness is shoved back at you  --  you ca n't even read a street sign . I was there for a two-year tour . I liked it a lot . Athena , my wife , she got to hate it . " Rosemont laughed . " She hates Hong Kong and wants to go back to Indochina , to Vietnam or Cambodia . She was a nurse there some years back with the French Army . " Through the fog of her own problems Casey heard an undercurrent and she began to listen . " She 's French ? " " American . Her father was ambassador for a tour during the French war . " " You have kids ? " she asked . " Two . Both sons . Athena was married before . " Another undercurrent . " Your sons were from her first marriage ? " " One was . She was married to a Vietnamese . He was killed just before Dien Bien Phu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gettingrun out . Poor guy was killed before young Vien was born . He 's like my own son . Yes , both my boys are great . You staying long ? " " Depends on my boss and our deal . Guess you know we 're hoping to tie in with Struan 's . " " It 's the talk of the town  --  apart from the fire at Aberdeen , the flooding , all the mud slides , the storm , Struan 's stock crash , the bank runs and thep803market falling apart  --  one thing about Hong Kong : it 's never dull . You think he 'll make it ? " NOBLE HOUSE 803 " The tai-pan ? I 've just left him . I hope so . He 's confident , yes very confident . I like him . " " Yes . I like Bartlett too . You been with him long ? " " Seven years , almost . " They were out of the terminal now , the road just as crowded . On the right was the harbor and they chatted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the V and A. Rosemont pointed at a small shop , the Rice Bowl . " Athena works there from time to time . It 's a charity shop , run by Americans . All the profit goes to refugees . Lot of the wives put in a day or two there , keeps them busy . I guess you 're busy all the time . " " Only seven days a week . " " I heard Linc say that you were taking off over the weekend for Taipei . Will that be your first visit ? " " Yes  --  but I 'm not going , just Line and the tai-pan . " Casey tried to stop the immediate thought welling but she could not : Is he going to take Orlanda ? He 's right , it 's none of my affair . But Par-Con is . And since Line 's hooked , lined and sinkered by the enemy , the less he knows about the First Central ploy the better . Pleased that she could come to the decision dispassionately , she continued to talk with Rosemont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converse with a friendly soul who was as informative as he was interested . " . . . and Taipei 's different , more easygoing , less hardnosed , but a comer , " he was saying . " We 're popular in Taiwan which 's a change . So you 're really going to spread ? On a big deal like this I guess you 've a dozen execs on hand ? " " No . There 's just the two of us at the moment , and Forrester  --  he 's head of our foam division  --  and our attorney . " Mentioning him , Casey hardened . Damn him for trying to stymie us . " Zinc 's got Par-Con organized very well . I handle the day-to-day and he fixes policy . " " You 're a public company ? " " Oh sure , but that 's okay too . Line has control and our directors and stockholders do n't give us a hassle . Dividends 're on the rise , and if the Struan deal goes through they 'll skyrocket . " " We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the Empiregreat for the British . I wish you luck , Casey . Hey , that reminds me , " he added casually , " you remember Ed , Ed Langan , my buddy , who was with me at the tai-pan 's party ? He knows one of your stockholders . A guy called Bestacio , some name like that . " Casey was startled . " Banastasio ? Vincenzo Banastasio ? " " Yes , I think that was it , " he told her , lying easily , watching her , and at her look added , " Did I say something ? "  |p804  " No , it 's just a coincidence . Banastasio arrives tomorrow . Tomorrow morning . " " What ? " Casey saw him staring at her and she laughed . " You can tell your friend he 's staying at the Hilton . " Rosemont 's mind buzzed . " Tomorrow ? I 'll be goddamned . " Casey said carefully , " He 's a good friend of Langan 's ? " " No , but he knows him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't he ? " " Yes . " " You do n't like him ? " " I 've only met him a couple of times . At the races . He 's big at Del Mar . I 'm not much on gamblers or gambling . " They were weaving through the crowds . People jostled from behind and oncoming hordes jostled from the front . The underpass stank of mildewand bodies . She was very glad to get back into the air once more and looking forward to a shower and an aspirin and a rest before 8:oo P.M. Beyondthe buildings ahead was the whole of the eastern harbor . A departingjet barreled into the overcast . Rosemont caught sight of the tall deck derricks of the Sovetsky Ivanov tied up alongside . Involuntarily he glanced Hong Kong side and saw how easy it would be for high-powered binoculars to rake the U.S. carrier and almost count her rivets . " Makes you proud to be an American , does n't it ? " Casey said happily , following his look . " If you 're consulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . Guided tour ! " " Lucky you . " " I was there yesterday . The captain had a shindig for locals . I tagged along . " Again Rosemont told the lie easily . He had gone aboard late last night and again this morning . His initial interview with the admiral , captainand security chief had been stormy . It was not until he produced photocopiesof the secret manifest of the ship 's armaments and the guidance systems manual that they had truly believed there had been a vast security leak . Now the traitor was under tight surveillance in the ship 's brig , guarded by his own CIA people , twenty-four hours a day . Soon the man would break . Yes , Rosemont thought , and after that , jail for twenty years . If it was up to me I 'd drop the bastard in the goddamn harbor . Shit , I 've got nothing against the Metkins and the KGB . Those bastards 're just doing their job for their side  --  however wrong they are . But our own Joes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First tell us why you did it . " " Money . " Jesus H. Christ ! The sailor 's dossier had shown that he had come from a small town in the Middle West , his work exemplary with nothing in his past or present to indicate a potential security risk . He was a quiet man , good at computer programming , liked by his compatriots and trusted byp805his superiors . No left-wing indications , no homosexuality , no problem of blackmail , no nothing . " Then why ? " he had asked him . " This guy came up to me in San Diego and said he 'd like to know all about the Corregidor and he 'd pay . " " But do n't you understand about treason ? About betraying your country ? " " Hell , all he wanted was a few facts and figures . So what ? What 's the difference ? We can blast the hell outta the goddamn Commies anytime we like . The Corregidor 's the greatest carrier afloat ! It was a caper and I wanted to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dot . . . . " Jesus , how we going to keep security when there are guys like him with their brains in their asses , Rosemont asked himself wearily . He walked along , listening to himself chatting with Casey , probing her , trying to decide what sort of a risk she was and Bartlett was , with their tieinto Banastasio . Soon they joined other people going up the wide steps to the hotel . A smiling pageboy opened the swing doors . The foyer was bustling . " Casey , I 'm early for my appointment . Can I buy you a drink ? " Casey hesitated , then smiled , liking him , enjoying chatting . " Sure , thanks . First let me collect my messages , okay ? " She went to the desk . There were a sheaf of telexes , and messages from Jannelli , Steigler and Forrester to please call . And a handwritten note from Bartlett . The note contained routine instructions about Par-Con , all of which she agreed to , and asked her to make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The note ended : " Casey , we 're going with Rothwell-Gornt . Let 's meet for breakfast in the suite , 9:00 A.M. See you then . " She went back to Rosemont . " Can I take a raincheck ? " " Bad news ? " " Oh no , just a load of stuff to deal with . " " Sure , but maybe you 'd like dinner next week , you and Linc ? I 'd like Athena to meet you . She 'll give you a call to fix the day , okay ? " " Thanks , I 'd like that . " Casey left him , her whole being more than ever committed to the course she had decided upon . Rosemont watched her go , then ordered a Cutty Sark and soda and began to wait , lost in thought . How much money 's Banastasio got in ParConand what 's he get in return ? Jesus H. Christ , Par-Con 's hot in defenseand space and a lot of secret crap . What 's that bum doing here ? Thank God I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the guys . He might 've missed Banastasio ... . Robert Armstrong arrived . " Jesus , Robert , you look terrible , " the American said . " You better get yourself a vacation or a good night 's rest or lay off the broads . " " Get stuffed ! You ready ? We 'd better leave . " " You 've time for a quick one . The bank date 's been changed to seven , there 's plenty of time . "  |p806  " Yes , but I do n't want to be late as we 're to meet the governor at his office . " " Okay . " Obediently Rosemont finished his drink , signed the bill and they walked back toward the ferry terminal . " How 's Dry Run ? " Armstrong asked . " They 're still there with flags flying . Looks like the Azerbaijan revolt fizzled . " Rosemont noticed the heaviness on the Englishman . " What 's eatingyou , Robert ? " " Sometimes I do n't like being a copper , that 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought you gave up smoking . " " I did . Listen , Stanley old friend , I 'd better warn you : you 're in the proverbial creek without a paddle . Crosse 's so mad he 's fit to be com-mitted . " " So what else 's new ? A lot of guys think he 's a basket case anyway . Jesus , it was Ed Langan who tipped you off about the AMG files in the first place . We 're allies for chrissake ! " " True , " Armstrong replied sourly , " but that 's no license to mount a totallyunauthorized raid on a totally clean flat belonging to the totally clean telephone company ! " " Who me ? " Rosemont looked pained . " What flat ? " " Sinclair Towers , flat 32 . You and your gorillas knocked down the door in the dead of the night . For what , may I ask ? " " How should I know ? " Rosemont knew he had to bluff this one through , but he was still furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His rage over the carrier leak , Metkin 's not being available for questioning , the whole Sevrin mess and Crosse 's perfidy , had prompted him to order the raid . One of his Chinese informantshad picked up a rumor that though the apartment was empty most of the time , sometimes it was used by Communist enemy agents  --  of gender unknown  --  and there was a meeting tonight . Connochie , one of his best agents , had led the raid and thought he caught a glimpse of two men going out the back but he was n't sure , and though he searched diligently , they had vanished and he found nothing in the apartment to prove or disprovethe rumor , just two half-empty glasses . The glasses were brought back and tested for fingerprints . One was clean , the other well marked . " I 've never been to 32 Sinclair Towers , for chrissake ! " " Maybe , but your Keystone Kops were there . Several tenants reported four tall , meaty Caucasians charging up and down the stairs . " Armstrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have to be yours . " " Not mine . No sir . " " Oh yes they were and that mistake 's going to backfire . Crosse 's already sent two pretty foul cables to London . The pity of it is you failed to catch anything and we catch hell because of your continual screw-ups ! "  |p807Rosemont  sighed . " Get off my back . I 've got something for you . " He told Armstrong of his conversation with Casey about Banastasio . " Of course we knew his connection with Par-Con but I did n't know he was arrivingtomorrow . What do you think ? " Armstrong had seen the arrival recorded on Photographer Ng 's calendar . " Interesting , " he said noncommittally . " I 'll tell the Old Man . But you 'd better have a good explanation for him about Sinclair Towers and do n't mention that I told you . " His fatigue was almost overwhelming him . This morning at 6:3o A.M. he had begun the first real probe of Brian Kwok . It was an orchestrated set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken out of his clean white cell and put naked into a filthy dungeon with dank walls and a stinking thin mattress on the mildewed floor . Then , ten minutes after the wake-up drug had jerked him into parched , aching consciousness , the light had blazed on and Armstrong had ripped the door open and cursed the SI jailer . " For chrissake , what 're you doing to Superintendent Kwok ? Have you gone mad ? How dare you treat him like this ! " " Superintendent Crosse 's orders , sir . This client 's b  --  " " There must be a mistake ! I do n't give a damn about Crosse ! " He had thrown the man out and put his full , kind attention onto his friend . " Here , old chum , do you want a cigarette ? " " Oh Christ . Thank . . . thanks . " Brian Kwok 's fingers had trembled as he held the cigarette and drew the smoke deep . " Robert , what . . . what the hell 's going on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard , that 's why I 'm here . I was told you 'd been on leave for a few days . Crosse 's gone mad . He claims you 're a Communistspy . " " Me ? For God 's sake . . . what 's the date today ? " " The thirtieth , Friday , " he had said at once , expecting the question , adding seven days . " Who won the fifth race ? " " Butterscotch Lass , " he had said , caught off guard , astonished that Brian Kwok was still functioning so well and not at all certain if his own slight hesitation had been read for the lie it was . " Why ? " " Just wondered . . . just . . . Listen , Robert , this 's a mistake . You 've got to help me . Do n't you s  --  " On cue Roger Crosse had come in like the wrath of God . " Listen , spy , I want names and addresses of all your contacts right now . Who 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . " Sir , it 's all a mistake . There 's no controller and I 'm no spy an  --  " Crosse had suddenly shoved blowups of the photos in his face . " Then explain how you were photographed in Ning-tok in front of your family pharmacy with your mother Fang-ling Wu . Explain how your real name'sp808Chu-toy Wu , second on of these parents , Ting-top Wu and Fang-ling Wu . " They had both seen the instant of shock on Brian Kwok 's face . " Lies , " he had mumbled , " lies , I 'm Brian Kar-shun Kwok and I 'm  --  " " You 're a liar ! " Crosse had shouted . " We have witnesses ! We have evidence ! You are identified by your gan sun , Ah Tam ! " Another gasp , covered almost brilliantly , then " I . . . I have no gan sun called Ah Tam . I h  --  " " You 'll spend the rest of your life in this cell unless you tell us everything . I 'll see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'll put you in chains ! Robert ! " Crosse had whirled on him . " You 're forbidden to come here without permission ! " Then he had stalked out of the cell . In the silence Armstrong remembered how nauseated he had been , havingseen the truth written on his friend 's face . He was too well trained an observer to be mistaken . " Christ , Brian , " he had said , continuing the game , hating his hypocrisy even so . " What possessed you to do it ? " " Do what ? " Brian Kwok had said defiantly . " You ca n't cheat me  --  or trick me , Robert ... It ca n't be seven days . I 'm innocent . " And the photos ? " " Fake . . . they 're fake , dreamed up by Crosse . " Brian Kwok had held onto his arm , a desperate light behind his eyes , and whispered hoarsely , " I told you Crosse 's the real mole . He 's the mole , Robert . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue , the brittle , officious SI jailer jerked the cell door open . " Sorry , sir , but you 've got to leave . " " All right , but first give him some water . " " No water 's allowed ! " " Goddamn you , get him some water ! " Reluctantly the jailer obeyed . While they were momentarily alone , Armstrong had slipped the cigarettes under the mattress . " Brian , I 'll do what I can . . . " Then the jailer was back in the room with a battered cup . " That 's all you can have ! " he said angrily . " I want the cup back ! " Thankfully Brian Kwok had gulped it and with it the drug . Armstrong left . The door slammed and the bolts shoved home . Abruptly the lights went out , leaving Brian Kwok in darkness . Ten minutes later Armstrong had gone back in with Dr. Dorn . And Crosse . Brian Kwok was unconscious , deeply drugged again and dreaming fitfully . " Robert , you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you see the client 's shock ? " " Yes sir . " " Good . So did I. No mistake about that , or his guilt . Doctor , step up the sleep-wake-up every hour on the hour for the next twenty-four ...

Robert , then you interrogate him again . If that does n't work , we put him into the Red Room . " Dr. Dorn had flinched and Armstrong recalled how his heart had missed a beat . " No , " he said . " For chrissake , the client 's guilty , Robert , " Crosse snarled , no longer playacting . " Guilty ! The client shopped Fong-fong and our lads and has done us God knows what damage .

He got out of the car and stomped to the side door of the bank where Johnjohn was waiting for him . " Have you read this ? " The governor waved the evening edition of the Guardian in the night air . The huge headline read : MPs ACCUSE PRC . " Bloody incompetent fools , what ? " " Yes sir . " Johnjohn was equally choleric . He led the way past the uniformed doorman into a large anteroom . " Ca n't you hang both of them ? " At their afternoon press conference , Grey and Broadhurst had proclaimedpublicly everything that he , Johnjohn , Dunross and the other taipanshad , at length , patiently condemned as totally against Britain 's , Hong Kong 's and China 's interest . Grey had gone on at length discussing his private and personal opinion that Red China was bent on world conquest and should be treated as the great enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unofficial official scream . " Johnjohn winced . " Oh God , not from Tiptop ? " " Of course from Tiptop . He said , in that calm silky voice of his , Your Excellency , when our peers in Peking read how important members of your great English Parliament view the Middle Kingdom , I think they will be really quite angry . ' I 'd say our chances of getting the temporary use of their money now is nil . " Another wave of anger went over Johnjohn . " That damned man implied his views were the committee 's views , which is totally untrue ! Ridiculous to inflame China under any circumstances . Without China 's benevolence our position here is totally untenable . Totally ! Bloody fool ! And we all went out of our way to explain ! " The governor took out a handkerchief and blew his nose . " Where are the others ? " " Superintendent Crosse and Mr. Sinders are using my office for a mo/ment . Ian 's on his way . What about Ian and Grey , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Extraordinary .

I put the time back to 7:00 P.M. to give me a chance to see Sinders and Stanley Rosemont . " The governor held up the paper . " You 've seen this ? " " Yes sir . The Chinese evening papers are so incensed , I 'm surprised every edition 's not on fire and all of Central with them . " " I 'd try them for treason , " Johnjohn said , his face sour . ' What the devil can we do , Ian ? " " Pray ! I 've already spoken to Guthrie , the Liberal MP , and some of the Tories . One of the Guardian 's top reporters is interviewing them right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuting all this poppycock . " Dunross wiped his hands . He could feel the sweat on his back as well . The combination of Grey , Tiptop , Jacques , Phillip Chen , the coin and the AMG files was unnerving him . Christ Jesus , he thought , what next ? His meeting with Murtagh of the Royal Belgium had been what Casey had forecast  --  a long shot but a good one . Coming out of that meeting someone had given him the afternoon papers and the bombshell that such ill-advised remarks was going to create had almost knocked him over . " We 'll have to just dismiss the whole thing publicly , and privately work like hell to make sure Grey 's bill to bring Hong Kong down to Britain'slevel never gets to a vote , or is voted down , and Labour never gets elected .

" " I agree . " Dunross was acutely aware they had not mentioned Grey 's relationship to him . " Robin Grey 's worse than a fool , " he said , thinking he might just as well bring it out into the open . " My god-cursed brother-in-law could not have done better for the Soviets if he was a member of the Politburo . Broadhurst as well . Stupid ! "  |p812After  a pause the governor said , " As the Chinese say , The devil gives you your relations , thank all gods you can choose your friends . " " You 're so right . Fortunately , the committee 's due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . all the other problems , perhaps it 'll all get lost in the shuffle . " Dunross mopped his brow . " It 's close in here , is n't it ?

The va  --  " In the hall the elevator opened and Roger Crosse and Edward Sinders , chief of MI-6 , came out . " Ah , Sinders , " the governor said as they both came into the anteroom , " I 'd like you to meet Mr. Dunross . " " Pleased to meet you , sir . " Sinders shook hands with Dunross . He was a middle-aged , middle height , nondescript man with crumpled clothes . His face was thin and colorless , the stubble of his beard gray . " Please excuse my rumpledness , sir , but I have n't been to the hotel yet . " " Sorry about that , " Dunross replied . " This could certainly have waited until tomorrow .

He knew they would tell him if they wanted him to know . The door closed behind him . Dunross glanced at the governor . " Do you attest , sir , formally , this is Edward Sinders , head of MI-6 ? " " I do . " The governor handed him an envelope . " I believe you wanted it in writing . " " Thank you , sir . " To Sinders , Dunross said , " Sorry , but you understand my reluctance . " " Of course . Good , then that 's settled . Shall we go , Mr. Dunross ? " " Who 's Mary McFee ? " Sinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perplexed , then at Dunross . " You have friends in high places , Mr. Dunross . May I ask who told you that ? " " Sorry . " Dunross kept his gaze on him . Alastair Struan had got the informationfrom some VIP in the Bank of England who had approached someone high up in the government . " All we want to do is to be sure Sinders is who he pretends to be . " " Mary McFee 's a friend , " Sinders said uneasily . " Sorry , that 's not good enough . " " A girl friend . " " Sorry , neither 's that . What 's her real name ? " Sinders hesitated , then , his face chalky , he took Dunross by the armp813and guided him to the far end of the room . He put his lips very close to Dunross 's ear . " Anastasia Kekilova , First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Embassy in London , " he whispered , his back to Crosse and the governor . Dunross nodded , satisfied , but Sinders held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly , " You 'd better forget that name . If the KGB ever suspect you know they 'll get it out of you . Then she 's dead , I 'm dead and so 're you . " Dunross nodded . " Fair enough . " Sinders took a deep breath , then turned and nodded at Crosse . " Now let 's have this done with , Roger . Your Excellency ? " Tensely they all followed him . Johnjohn was waiting at the elevator . Three floors below were the vaults . Two plainclothes guards waited in the small hallway in front of the heavy iron gates , one man CID , the other SI . Both saluted . Johnjohn unlocked the gates and let everyone through except the guards , then relocked them . " Just a bank custom . " " Have you ever had a break-in ? " Sinders asked . " No , though the Japanese did force the gates when the keys were , er , lost . " " Were you here then , sir ? " " No . I was lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two British banks , Blacs and the Victoria , became prime Japanese targetsand were ordered to be liquidated . All the executives were separated and kept under guard and forced to assist the process . Over the months and years they were all subjected to extreme pressures . They were forced to issue bank notes illegally . And then the Kampeitai , the hated and feared Japanese secret police , had become involved . " The Kampeitai executedseveral of our fellows and made the lives of the rest miserable , " Johnjohn said . " The usual : no food , beatings , privation , shut up in cages . Some died of malnutrition  --  starvation 's the real word  --  and both Blacs and we lost our chief execs . " Johnjohn unlocked another grille . Beyond were rows and rows of safe deposit boxes in several interconnecting concrete , reinforced cellars . " Ian ? " Dunross took out his passkey . " It 's 16.85.94 . " Johnjohn led the way . Very uncomfortable , he inserted his bank key in one lock . Dunross did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lock clicked open . Now all eyes were on the box . Johnjohn took out his key . " I 'll . . . I 'll be waiting at the gate , " he said , glad it was over , and left . Dunross hesitated . " There are other things in here , private papers . Do you mind ? " Crosse did not move . " Sorry but either Mr. Sinders or myself should ensurewe get possession of all the files . " Dunross noticed the sweat on both men . His own back was wet . " Your Excellency , would you mind watching ? " " Not at all . " Reluctantly the two other men retreated . Dunross waited until theyp814were well away , then opened the box . It was large . Sir Geoffrey 's eyes widened . The box was empty but for the blue covered files . Without commenthe accepted them . There were eight . Dunross slammed the box closed and the lock clicked home . Crosse came forward , his hand out . " Shall I take them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , startled , and bit back a curse . " But , Exce  --  " " The minister set up a procedure  --  approved by our American friends  --  which I agreed to , " Sir Geoffrey said . " We will all go back to my office . We will all witness the photocopying . Two copies only . One for Mr. Sinders , one for Mr. Rosemont . Ian , I have been directly ordered by the Minister to give Mr. Rosemont copies . " Dunross shrugged , desperately hoping that he still appeared unconcerned . " If that 's what the minister wants , that 's perfectly all right . When you 've photocopied the originals , sir , please burn them . " He saw them look at him but he was watching Crosse and he thought he saw an instant of pleasure . " If the files 're so special then it 's better they should n't exist  --  except in the correct hands , MI-6 and the CIA . Certainly I should n't have a copy . If they 're not special  --  then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farfetched and now that he 's dead I must confess I do n't consider the files special so long as they 're in your hands . Please burn or shred them , Excellency . " " Very well . " The governor turned his pale blue eyes on Roger Crosse . " Yes , Roger ? " " Nothing , sir . Shall we go ? " Dunross said , " I 've got to get some corporate papers to check while I 'm here . No need to wait for me . " " Very well . Thank you , Ian , " Sir Geoffrey said and left with the other two men . When he was quite alone Dunross went to another bank of boxes in thethe adjoining vault . He took out his key ring and selected two keys , grimly aware that Johnjohn would have a coronary if he knew he had a duplicate master key . The lock sprang back soundlessly . This box was one of dozens the Noble House possessed under different names . Inside were bundles of U.S. $100 notes , ancient deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As always , Dunross 's psyche was unsettled , hating guns , hating Hag Struan , admiring her . In her " Instructions to Tai Pans , " written just before her death in 1917 , that was part of her last will and testament and in the tai-pan 's safe , she had laid down more rules and one of them was that there should always be substantial amounts of secret cash for the taipan'suse , on hand , and another that there should be at least four loaded handguns perpetually available in secret places . She wrote : " I abhor guns but I know them to be necessary . On Michaelmas Eve in 1916 when I was infirm and sick , my grandson Kelly O'Gorman , fourth tai-pan ( in name only ) , believing I was on my deathbed , forced me from my bed top815the safe in the Great House to fetch the seal-chop of the Noble House  --  to assign to him absolute power as tai-pan . Instead I took the gun that was secretly in the safe and shot him . He lingered two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns and some killing , but Kelly became a mad dog and it is the duty of the tai-pan to protect the succession . I regret his death not a jot or tittle . You who read this beware : kith or kin lust for power as others do . Do not be afraid to use any method to protect Dirk Struan 's legacy . . . " A bead of sweat trickled down his cheek . He remembered the hair on the nape of his neck rising when he had first read her instructions , the night he had taken over as tai-pan . He 'd always believed that Cousin Kelly  --  eldest son of the Hag 's last daughter Rose  --  had died of cholera in one of the great waves that perpetually washed Asia . There were other monstrosities she had written about : " In 1894 , that most terrible of years , the second of Jin-qua 's coins was brought to me . That was the year plague had come to Hong Kong , bubonic plague . Amongst our heathen Chinese , tens of thousands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague took high and low , Cousin Hannah and three children , two of Chen-chen 's children , five grandchildren . Legend foretold that bubonic plague was wind-borne . Others thought it was the curse of God or a flux like malaria , the killing bad air ' of Happy Valley . Then the miracle ! The Japanese research doctors Vitasatoand Aoyama we brought to Hong Kong isolated the plague bacillus and proved the pest was flea-borne , and rat-borne , and that correct sanitationand the elimination of rats would cast out the curse forever . The eyesore hillside of Tai-ping Shan that Gordon owns  --  Gordon Chen , son of my beloved tai-pan  --  where most of our heathen always lived was a stinking , festering , overcrowded , rat-breeding cauldron for all pestilences , and as much as the authorities cajoled , ordered and insisted , the superstitious inhabitants there disbelieved everything and would do nothing to could do nothing  --  tearing his hair at his loss of rents , saving his energy for the four young women in his household . " In the stench of late summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deaths mounting daily , I had Tai-ping Shan put to the torch by night , the whole monstrous stenching mountainside . That some inhabitants were consumed is on my conscience , but without the cleansing fire the Colony was doomed and hundreds of thousands more doomed . I caused Tai-ping Shan to be fired but thereby I kept troth with Hong Kong . I kept troth with the Legacy . And I kept troth with the second of the half coins . " On the twentieth of April a man called Chiang Wu-tah presented the half coin to my darling young cousin , Dirk Dunross , third tai-pan , who brought it to me , he not knowing the secret of the coins . I sent for the man Chiang who spoke English . The favor he asked was that the Noblep816House should grant immediate sanctuary and succor to a young , WesterneducatedChinese revolutionary named Sun Yat-sen ; that we should help this Sun Yat-sen with funds ; and that we should help him as long as he lived , to the limits of our power in his fight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against China 's rulingdynasty with whom we had cordial relations and on whom depended much of our trade and revenues was against my principles , and seemingly against the interests of the House . I said no , I would not assist the overthrowof their emperor . But Chiang Wu-tah said , This is the favor requiredfrom the Noble House . ' " And so it was done . " At great risk I provided funds and protection . My darling Dirk Dunross spirited Dr. Sun out of Canton to the Colony and from there abroad to America . I wanted Dr. Sun to accompany young Dirk to England  --  hewas leaving on the tide , Master of our steamer Sunset Cloud . That was the week I wanted to hand over to him as real tai-pan but he said , No , not until I return . ' But he was never to return . He and all hands were lost at sea somewhere in the Indian Ocean . Oh how terrible my loss , our loss ! " But death is a part of life and we the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet know to whom I should hand over . It should have been Dirk Dunross , who was named for his grandfather . His sons are too young , none of the Coopers are adequate , or deVilles , Daglish is possible , none of the MacStruans are yet ready . Alastair Struan perhaps but there 's a weaknessthere that comes down from Robb Struan . " I do n't mind admitting to you , future tai-pan , that I am weary unto death . But I am not yet ready to die . Pray God I am given the strength for a few more years . There is not one of my line or my beloved Dirk Struan 's line worthy of his mantle . And now there is this Great War to see through , the House to rebuild , our merchant fleet to refurbish  --  so far GermanU-boats have sunk thirty of our ships , almost our whole fleet . Yes , and there is the favor of the second coin still to fulfill . This Dr. Sun Yatsenmust and will be supported until he dies and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did , Dunross thought . The Noble House supported him in all his troubles , even when he tried to join with Soviet Russia , until he died in 1925 and Chiang Kai-shek , his Soviet-trained lieutenant , assumed his mantle and launched China into the future  --  until his old ally but ancient enemy , Mao Tse-tung , took the future away from him to mount the Dragon Throne in Peking with bloody hands , first of a new dynasty . Dunross took out a handkerchief anu mopped his brow . The air in the vault was dusty and dry and a little caught in his throat and he coughed . His hands were sweaty too and he could still feel the chill on his back . He rummaged carefully to the bottom of the deep metal box and found his corporate chop that he would need over the weekend inp817case the Royal Belgium  --  First Central deal came to pass . I certainly owe Casey more than one favor if the deal is made , he told himself . His heart was thumping again and he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret false bottom of the safety deposit box a fraction . In the two-inch space beneath were eight blue-covered files . AMG 's real files . Those that moments ago he had passed over to Sinders had been in the sealed package that Kirk and his wife had brought yesterday  --  thoseeight counterfeit files and a letter : " Tai-pan : I am terribly worried that both you and I are betrayed and that information contained in previous files may fall into the wrong hands . The enclosed substitute files are safe and very similar . They drop vital names and vital information . You may pass these over if you are forced to do it , but only then . As to the originals , you should destroy them after you have seen Riko . Certainpages contain invisible writing . Riko will give you the key . Please excuseall these diversionary tactics but espionage is not for children ; it deals in death , actual and in the future . Our lovely Britain is beset with traitors and evil walks the earth . Bluntly , freedom is under siege as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrious ancestor . He fought for freedom to trade , to live and to worship . Sorry , but I do n't think he died in a storm . We 'll never know the truth but I believe he was murdered , as I will be . Not to worry , my young friend . I 've done very well in my life . I 've put a lot of nails in the enemy coffin , more than my fair share  --  I ask you to do the same . " The letter was signed , " With great respect . " Poor bugger , Dunross thought sadly . Yesterday he had smuggled the counterfeit files into the vault , replacing the originals in the other box . He would have liked to have destroyed the originals then but there was no way to do that safely and anyway he had to wait for his meeting with the Japanese woman . Better and safer to leave them where they are for the moment , he said to himself . Plenty of tiSuddenly he felt eyes . His hand sneaked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around . His stomach seemed to turn over . Crosse was watching him . And Johnjohn . They were at the entrance to the vault . After a moment Crosse said , " I just wanted to thank you for your cooperation , Ian . Mr. Sinders and I appreciate it . " Relief poured through Dunross . " That 's all right . Glad to help . " Trying to be casual he relaxed his hold on the automatic and let it slide away . The false bottom fell silently into place . He saw Crosse 's scrutiny but shrugged it off . From where the superintendent stood he did not think it possible for him to have seen the real files . Dunross blessed his joss that had prevented him from taking one of the files out to leaf through it . Carelessly he slammed the box shut and his breathing began again . " It reallyis quite stuffy in here , is n't it ? " " Yes . Again , Ian , thank you . " Crosse left.  |p818  " How did you open that box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Two keys , Ian . That 's against regulations . " Johnjohn held out his hand . " May I have our property please . " " Sorry , old chum , " Dunross said calmly , " it 's not your property . " Johnjohn hesitated . " We always suspected you had a duplicate master key . Paul is right about one thing : you 've too much power , you consider this bank yours , our funds yours and the Colony yours . " " We 've had a long and happy association with both , and it 's only in the last few years when Paul Havergill 's had some measure of power that I 've had a hard time , me personally , and my House personally . But worse than that , he 's old-fashioned and I voted him out for that reason only . You 're not , you 're modern . You 'll be fairer , far-seeing , less emotional and straighter . " Johnjohn shook his head . " I doubt it . If I ever become tai-pan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by its stockholders and controlled by directors appointed by them . " " It is now . We just own 21 percent of the bank . " " You used to own 21 percent . That stock 's pledged against your revolvingfund which you ca n't and probably never will repay . Besides , 21 percentis not control , thank God . " " It very nearly is . " " My whole point . " Johnjohn 's voice was metallic . " That 's dangerous for the bank , very dangerous . " " I do n't think so . " " I do . I want 11 percent back . " " No sale , old lad . " " When I 'm tai-pan , old lad , I 'll get it by hook or by crook . " " We 'll see . " " When I 'm tai-pan I 'm going to make lots of changes . All these locks for example . No master keys , privately owned . " " We 'll see . " Dunross smiled . On Kowloon side , Bartlett jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard . Automatically she kicked off her high heels to protect the fine teak deck . " Welcome aboard the Sea Witch , Mr. Bartlett . Evening , Orlanda , " Gornt said with a smile . He was at the helm and at once he motioned to his deckhand who cast off from the wharf that was near the Kowloon ferry terminal . " I 'm delighted you accepted my invitation to dinner , Mr. Bartlett . " " I did n't know I had one until Orlanda told me half an hour ago .. . hey , this 's a great boat ! " Gornt jovially put the engines into slow astern . " Until an hour ago Ip819did n't know you two were going to dinner by yourselves . I presumed you 'd never seen Hong Kong harbor by night so I thought it 'd make a change for you . There were a couple of things I wanted to discuss privatelyso I asked Orlanda if she 'd mind if I invited you aboard . " " I hope it was no trouble to come Kowloon side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine to pick up guests here . " Gornt smiled a secret smile , thinking about Orlanda and all the other guests he had fetched from this Kowloon wharf over the years . Deftly Gornt backed the motor cruiser away from the Kowloon dock near Golden Ferry where the waves slapped the quay dangerously . He put the engine levers into half ahead and swung the tiller starboard to get out into the roads and set a westerly course . The boat was seventy feet , trim , elegant , sparkling and she handled like a speedboat . They were on the bridge deck , glass-sided , open to the air aft , awnings overhead tight and crackling in the breeze , the wake churning . Gornt wore rough , casual sea clothes , a light reefer jacket and a jaunty peaked cap sporting the Yacht Club emblem . The clothes and his trimmed black , gray-flecked beard suited him . He swayed easily with the motion of the boat , very much at home . Bartlett was watching him , at home too in sneakers and casual sweat shirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not touching . She wore a dark evening pants suit and a shawl against the sea cold and she stood swaying easily , the wind in her hair , tiny without shoes . He looked aft across the harbor at the ferries , junks , liners and the immensebulk of the battle-gray nuclear carrier , her decks floodlit , her flag fluttering bravely . A jet shrieked into the night sky from Kai Tak and incomingjets approaching Kowloon were stacked up . He could not see the airport or his own airplane from this angle but he knew where it was parked . This afternoon he had visited it with police permission to check and fetch some papers and provisions . Orlanda , beside him , touched him casually and he looked at her . She smiled back and he was warmed . " Great , is n't it ? " Happily she nodded . There was no need to answer . Both knew . " It is , " Gornt said , thinking that Bartlett was talking to him and looked around at him . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own craft . We go west , then almost due south around Hong Kong  --  about three quartersof an hour . " He beckoned his captain who was nearby , a silent lithe Shanghainese wearing neat , starched white ducks . " Shey-shey , " thank you , the man said taking the helm . Gornt waved to the chairs aft around a table . " Shall we ? " He glanced at Orlanda . " You 're looking very pretty , Orlanda . " " Thank you , " she said . " You 're not too cold ? "  |p820  " Oh no , Quillan , thank you . " A liveried steward came from below . On his tray were hot and cold canapes . In the ice bucket beside the table was an opened bottle of white wine , four glasses , two cans of American beer and some soft drinks . " What can I offer you , Mr. Bartlett ? " Gornt asked . " The wine 's Frascati but I hear you prefer iced cold beer out of the can ? " " Tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Orlanda ? " " Wine please , Quillan , " she said calmly , knowing that he knew she preferred Frascati to any other wine . I 'll have to be very wise tonight , she thought , very strong and very wise and very clever . She had agreed to Gornt 's suggestion at once for she , too , loved the water at night and the restaurant was a favorite though she would have preferred to have been alone with Linc Bartlett . But it was clearly an . . . No , she thought , correctingherself . It was n't an order , it was a request . Quillan 's on my side . And in this , my side and his side have the same aim in common : Line . Oh how I enjoy Linc ! When she looked at him she saw he was watching Gornt . Her heart quickened . It was like once when Gornt had taken her to Spain and she had seen a mano a mano . Yes , these two men are like matadors tonight . I know Quillan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , her excitement in place . " Wine would be fine for me . " It was dark on deck , the lighting comfortable and intimate . The steward poured , this wine as always very good , delicate , dry and enticing . Bartlett opened an air carry bag that he had brought with him . " It 's an old Americancustom to bring a gift the first time you go to a home  --  I guess this is a home . " He put the wine bottle on the table . " Oh that 's very kind of . . . " Gornt stopped . Delicately he picked up the bottle and stared at it , then got up and looked at it under the binnacle light . He sat down again . " That 's not a gift , Mr. Bartlett , that 's bottled magic . I thought my eyes were deceiving me . " It was a Chateau Margaux , one of the great premier cru clarets from the Medoc in the province of Bordeaux . " I 've never had the ' 49 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Thank you very much . " " Orlanda said you liked red better than white but I guessed we might have some fish . " Casually he put the second bottle beside the first . Gornt stared at it . It was a Chateau Haut-Brion . In good years Chateau Haut-Brion red compared with all the great Medocs , but the white  --  dry , delicate and little known because it was so scarce  --  was considered one of the finest of all the great Bordeaux whites . The year was ' 55 . Gornt sighed . " If you know so much about wines , Mr. Bartlett , why do you drink beer ? " " I like beer with pasta , Mr. Gornt , and beer before lunch . But wine with food . " Bartlett grinned . " Come Tuesday , we 'll have beer with thep821pasta , then Frascati or Verdicchio or the Umbrian Casale with . . . with what ? " " Piccata ? " " Great , " Bartlett said , not wanting any piccata other than Orlanda 's . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention on Gornt and did not glance at Orlanda but he knew she knew what he meant . I 'm glad I tested her . " Oh did you have a good time ? " she had said when she had called for him this morning at the small hotel on Sunning Road . " Oh I do hope so , Linc , darling . " The other girl had been beautiful but there had been no feeling other than lust , the satisfaction of the joining minimal . He had told her . " Oh then that 's my fault . We chose wrong , " she had said unhappily . " Tonight we 'll have dinner and we 'll try somewhere else . " Involuntarily he smiled and looked at her . The sea breeze was making her more beautiful . Then he noticed Gornt watching them . " Are we eatingfish tonight ? " " Oh yes . Orlanda , did you tell Mr. Bartlett about Pok Liu Chau ? " " No , Quillan , just that we 've been invited for a sail . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seafood there 's excellent , Mr. Bartlett . You pi  --  " " Why do n't you call me Linc and let me call you Quillan ? The mister ' bit gives me indigestion . " They all laughed . Gornt said , " Linc , with your permission we 'll not open your gift tonight . Chinese food 's not for these great wines , they would n't complement each other . I 'll keep them , if I may , for our dinner Tuesday ? " " Of course . " There was a small silence within the muted thunder of the diesel enginesbelow . Immediately sensing Gornt wanted privacy , Orlanda got up with a smile . " Excuse me a second , I just want to powder my nose . " " Use the forward cabins , the forward gangway , Orlanda , " Gornt said , watching her . " Thank you , " she said and walked off , in one way glad , in another hurt . The forward cabins were for guests . She would have automatically gone down this gangway to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the suite that once was theirs . Never mind . The past is the past and now there 's Linc , she thought , going forward . Bartlett sipped his wine , wondering why Orlanda had seemed to hesitate . He concentrated on Gornt . " How many does this boat sleep ? " " Ten comfortably . There 's a regular crew of four  --  captain-engineer , a deckhand , cook and steward . I 'll show you around later if you like . " Gornt lit a cigarette . " You do n't smoke ? " " No , no thanks . "  |p822  " We can cruise for a week without refueling . If necessary . We still concludeour deal on Tuesday ? " " That 's still D Day . " " Have you changed your mind ? About Struan 's ? " " Monday 'll still decide the battle . Monday at 3:0o P.M. When the market closes , you 've got Ian or you have n't and it 's a standoff again . " " This time it wo n't be a standoff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks that way . " " Are you still going to Taipei with him ? " " That 's still the plan . " Gornt took a deep drag of his cigarette . His eyes checked the lie of his ship . They were well out into the main channel . Gornt got up and stood beside the captain a moment but the captain had also seen the small unlit junk ahead and he skirted it without danger . " Full ahead , " Gornt said and came back . He refilled the glasses , chose one of the deep-fried dim sum and looked at the American . " Linc , may I be blunt ? " " Sure . " " Orlanda . " Bartlett 's eyes narrowed . " What about her ? " " As you probably know , she and I were very good friends once . Very good . Hong Kong 's a very gossipy place and you 'll hear all sorts of rumors , but we 're still friends though we have n't been together for three years . " Gornt looked at him under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that I would n't want her harmed . " His teeth glinted with his smile in the gimbaled light over the table . " And she 's as fine a person and companionas you could find . " " I agree . " " Sorry , do n't want to belabor anything , just wanted to make three points , one man to another . That was the first . The second 's that she 's as closed-mouthed as any woman I 've ever known . The third 's that she 's nothing to do with business  --  I 'm not using her , she 's not a prize , or bait or anything like that . " Bartlett let the silence hang . Then he nodded . " Sure . " " You do n't believe me ? " Bartlett laughed . It was a good laugh . " Hell , Quillan , this 's Hong Kong ! I 'm out of my depth in more ways than you can shake a stick at . I do n't even know if Pok Liu Chau 's the name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China . " He drank the wine , enjoying it . " As to Orlanda , she 's great and you 've no need to worry . I got the message . " " I hope you do n't mind my mentioning it . " Bartlett shook his head . " I 'm glad you did . " He hesitated , then because the other man was open he decided to get everything into the open . " She told me about the child . " " Good . " " Why the frown ? "  |p823  " I 'm just surprised she 'd mention her now . Orlanda must like you very much . " Bartlett felt the power of the eyes watching him and he tried to read if there was envy there . " I hope she does . She said you 'd been great to her since you split . And to her folks . " " They 're nice people . It 's rough in Asia to raise five children , raise them well . It was always our company policy to help families where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time I saw Orlanda was when she was ten . It was a Saturday at the races in Shanghai . In those days everyone would dress up in their best clothes and stroll the paddocks . It was her first formal coming out . Her father was a manager in our shipping division  --  agood fellow , Eduardo Ramos , third-generation Macao , his wife pure Shanghainese . But Orlanda . . . " Gornt sighed . " Orlanda was the prettiest girl I 'd ever seen . Her dress was white . . . I do n't remember seeingher after that until she came back from school . She was almost eighteenthen and , well , I fell madly in love with her . " Gornt looked up from his glass . " I ca n't tell you how lucky I felt all those years with her . " His eyes hardened . " Did she tell you I broke the man who seduced her ? " " Yes . " " Good . Then you know it all . " Gornt added with great dignity , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a sudden warmth toward the other man . " I appreciate them . " He leaned forward to accept more wine . " Why do n't we leave it this way . Come Tuesday all debts and friendships are canceled and we start fresh . All of us . " " Meanwhile , which side are you on ? " Gornt asked , the front of his face a smile . " For the raid , yours , one hundred percent ! " Bartlett said at once . " For Par-Con 's probe into Asia ? I 'm in the middle . I wait for the winner . I lean toward you and I hope you 're the winner , but I 'm waiting . " " The two are n't the same ? " " No . I set the ground rules of the raid way back . I said the raid was a onetime operation , a fool 's mate . " Bartlett smiled . " Sure , Quillan , I 'm a hundred percent with you on the raid  --  did n't I put up the 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handshake ? " After a pause , Gornt said , " In Hong Kong , sometimes that 's more valuable . I have n't the exact figures but on paper we 're between 24 and 3o millionHK ahead . " Bartlett raised his glass . " Hallelujah ! But meanwhile how about the bank run ? How will that affect us ? " Gornt frowned . " I do n't think it will . Our market 's very volatile but Blacs and the Vic are solid , unbreakable , the government has to support both of them . There 's a rumor the governor 'll declare Monday a bank holidayand close the banks for as long as needed  --  it 's just a matter of time beforecash becomes available to stop the loss of confidence . Meanwhile , ap824lot will get burned and a lot of banks will go to the wall but that should n't affect our plan . " When do you buy back in ? " " That depends on when you dump Struan 's . " " How about noon Monday ? That gives you plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the news leaks and the shares go down some more . " " Excellent . Chinese work on rumors , very much , so the market can swing from boom to bust or vice versa very easily . Noon is fine . You 'll do that in Taipei ? " " Yes . " " I 'll need a telex confirmation . " " Casey 'll give it to you . " " She knows ? About the plan ? " " Yes . Now she does . How many shares do you need for control ? " " You should have that information . " " That 's the only piece missing . " " When we buy in we 'll have enough to give us at least three immediate seats on the board and Ian 's through . Once we 're on the board Struan 's is in our power , and then , very soon , I merge Struan 's with Rothwell-Gornt " " And you 're tai-pan of the Noble House . " " Yes . " Gornt 's eyes glinted . He refilled the glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank , content with their deal . But in their secret hearts neither trusted the other , not even a little . Both were very glad they had contingencyplans  --  if need be . Grim-faced , the three men came out of Government House and got into Crosse 's car . Crosse drove . Sinders sat in the front , Rosemont in the back and both of them held on tightly to their still unread copies of the AMG files . The night was dark , the sky scudding and the traffic heavier than usual . Rosemont , sitting in the back , said , " You think the guv ' 11 read the originalsbefore he shreds them ? " " I would , " Sinders replied without turning to look at him . " Sir Geoffrey 's much too clever to do that , " Crosse said . " He wo n't shred the originals until your copy 's safely in the minister 's hands , just in case you do n't arrive . Even so he 's far too shrewd to read something that could be an embarrassment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Again there was a silence . Then , unable to hold back anymore , Rosemont said coldly , " What about Metkin ? Eh ? Where was the foul-up , Rog ? "  |p825  " Bombay . The aircraft had to have been sabotaged there , if it was sabo-tage . " " For chrissake , Rog , got ta be . Of course someone was tipped . Wherewas the leak ? Your goddamn mole again ? " He waited but neither man answeredhim . " What about the Ivanov , Rog ? You going to impound her and make a sudden search ? " " The governor checked with London and they thought it unwise to create an incident . " " What the hell do those meatheads know ? " Rosemont said angrily . " She 's a spy ship , for chrissake ! Betcha fifty to a bent hatpin we 'd get currentcode books , a look at the best surveillance gear in the USSR and five or six KGB experts . Huh ? " " Of course you 're right , Mr. Rosemont , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without the necessary approval . " " Let me and my guys d  --  " " Absolutely not ! " Irritably Sinders took out his cigarettes . The pack was empty . Crosse offered his . " So you 're going to let ' em get away with it ? " " I 'm going to invite the captain , Captain Suslev , to HQ tomorrow and ask him for an explanation , " Sinders said . " I 'd like to be party to that . " " I 'll consider it . " " You 'll have an official okay before 9:00 A.M. " Sinders snapped , " Sorry , Mr. Rosemont , but if I wish I can override any directives from your brass while I 'm here . " " We 're allies for chrissake ! " Crosse said sharply , " Then why did you raid 32 Sinclair Towers , unin-vited ? " Rosemont sighed and told them . Thoughtfully Sinders glanced at Crosse , then back at Rosemont . " Who told you that it was an enemy safe house , Mr. Rosemont ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was part of a debriefing . I ca n't tell you who but I 'll give you copies of the sets of fingerprints off the glass we got if you want them . " Sinders said , " That would be very useful . Thank you . " " That still does n't absolve you from a fatuous , unauthorized raid , " Crosse said coldly . " I said I 'm sorry , okay ? " Rosemont flared and his chin jutted . " We all make mistakes . Like Philby , Burgess and Maclean ! London 's so goddamn smart , eh ? We 've a hot tip you 've a fourth guy  --  higher up , equally well placed and laughing at you . " Crosse and Sinders were startled . They glanced at one another . Then Sinders craned around . " Who ? " " If I knew , he 'd be jumped . Philby got away with so much of our stuff it cost us millions to regroup and recode. "  |p826Sinders  said , " Sorry about Philby . Yes , we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make mistakes and the only sin 's failure , right ? If I 'd caught a couple of enemy agents last night you 'd be cheering . So I failed . I said I 'm sorry , okay ? I 'll ask next time , okay ? " Crosse said , " You wo n't but it would save us all a lot of grief if you did . " " What have you heard about a fourth man ? " Sinders asked , his face pale , the stubble of his beard making him appear even more soiled than he was . " Last month we busted another Commie ring , Stateside . Shit , they 're like roaches . This cell was four people , two in New York , two in Washington . The guy in New York was Ivan Egorov , another officer in the UN Secretariat . " Rosemont added bitterly , " Jesus , why do n't our side wake up that the goddamn UN 's riddled with plants , and the best Soviet weapon since they stole our goddamn bomb ! We caught Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers . The guys in Washington , both 'd taken American names of real people who were dead : a Roman Catholic priest and a woman from Connecticut . The four bastardswere tied in with a joker from the Soviet Embassy , an attache who was their controller . We pounced on him trying to recruit one of our CIA guys to spy for them . Sure . But before we ordered him out of the States , we frightened him enough to blow the cover on the other four . One of them tipped us that Philby was n't kingpin , that there was a fourth man . " Sinders coughed and lit another cigarette from the stub of the other . " What did he say . Exactly ? " " Only that Philby 's cell was four . The fourth 's the guy who inducted the others , the controller of the cell and the main link to the Soviets . Rumor was he 's up there . VVIP . " " What sort ? Political ? Foreign Office ? Gentry ? " Rosemont shrugged . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into his shell . Crosse swung into Sinclair Road , and stopped at his own apartment to let Sinders off , then drove to the consulate that was near Government House . Rosemont got a copy of the fingerprints then guided Crosse to his office . The office was large and well stocked with liquor . " Scotch ? " " Vodka with a dash of Rose 's lime juice , " Crosse said , eyeing the AMG files that Rosemont had put carelessly on his desk . " Health . " They touched glasses . Rosemont drank his Scotch deeply . " What 's on your mind , Rog ? You 've been like a cat on a hot tin roof all day . " Crosse nodded at the files . " It 's them . I want that mole . I want Sevrin smashed . " Rosemont frowned . " Okay , " he said after a pause , " let 's see what we got . " He picked up the first file , put his feet on the desk and began reading.  |p827It  took him barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over to Crosse who read equally fast . Quickly they went through the files one by one . Crosse closed the last page of the last one and handed it back . He lit a cigarette . " Too much to comment on now , " Rosemont muttered absently . Crosse caught an undercurrent in the American 's voice and wondered if he was being tested . " One thing jumps out , " he said , watching Rosemont . " These do n't compare in quality with the other one , the one we inter-cepted . " Rosemont nodded . " I got that too , Rog . How do you figure it ? " " These seem flat . All sorts of questions are unanswered . Sevrin 's skirted , so 's the mole . " Crosse toyed with his vodka then finished it . " I 'm disap-pointed . " Rosemont broke the silence . " So either the one we got was unique and different , written differently , or these 're phonies or phonied up ? " " Yes . " Rosemont exhaled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phony , he 's still got the real ones . " " Either actually , or in his head . " " What do you mean ? " " He 's supposed to have a photographic memory . He could have destroyedthe real ones and prepared these , but still remember the others . " " Ah , so he could be debriefed if he . . . if he 's cheated us . " Crosse lit another cigarette . " Yes . If the powers-that-be decided it was necessary . " He looked up at Rosemont . " Of course , any such debriefing would be highly dangerous and would have to be ordered solely under the Official Secrets Act . " Rosemont 's used face became even grimmer . " Should I take the ball and run ? " " No . First we have to be sure . That should be relatively easy . " Crosse glanced at the liquor cabinet . " May I ? " " Sure . I 'll take another shot of whiskey . " Crosse handed him the refill . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely , you do n't do anything without telling me in advance , no secrets , no jumping the gun . . . " " In return for ? " Crosse smiled his thin smile and took out some photocopies . " How would you like to influence , perhaps even control , certain presidential hopefuls  --  perhaps even an election ? " " I do n't follow you . " Crosse passed over the letters of Thomas K. K. Lim that Armstrong and his team had acquired in the raid on Bucktooth Lo two days before . " It seems that certain very rich , very well-connected U.S. families are in league with certain U.S. generals to build several large but unnecessary airfields in Vietnam , for personal gain . This documents the how , whenp828and who . " Crosse told him where and how the papers had been found and added , " Is n't Senator Wilf Tillman , the one that 's here now , a presidentialhopeful ? I imagine he 'd make you head of the CIA for these goodies  --  if you wanted to give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crosse put them on the desk . " These document how certain rather wellconnectedpoliticians and the same well-connected families have got congressionalapproval to channel millions into a totally fraudulent aid programin Vietnam . 8 millions have already been paid over . " Rosemont read the letters . His face went chalky . He picked up the phone . " Get me Ed Langan . " He waited a moment , then his face went suddenly purple . " I do n't give a goddamn ! " he rasped . " Get off your goddamnbutt and get Ed here right now . " He slammed the phone back onto its hook , cursing obscenely , opened his desk , found a bottle of antacid pills and took three . " I 'll never make fifty at this rate , " he muttered . " Rog , this joker , Thomas K. K. Lim , can we have him ? " " If you can find him , be my guest . He 's somewhere in South America . " Crosse put down another paper . " This 's Anti-Corruption 's confidential report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rosemont read it . " Jesus . " After a pause he said , " Can we keep this between us ? It 's liable to blow the roof off a couple of our national monu-ments . " " Of course . We have a deal ? Nothing hidden on either side ? " " Okay . " Rosemont went to the safe and unlocked it . " One good turn deserves another . " He found the file he was looking for , took out some papers , put the file back and relocked the safe . " Here , these 're photocopies . You can have ' em . " The photocopies were headed " Freedom Fighter " dated this month and last month . Crosse went through them quickly and whistled from time to time . They were espionage reports , their quality excellent . All the items dealt with Canton , happenings in and around that vital capital city of Kwantung Province : troop movements , promotions , appointments to the local presidiums and Communist Party , floods , food shortages , the military , numbers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores . " Where 'd you get these ? " he asked . " We 've a cell operating in Canton . This 's one of their reports , we get them monthly . Shall I give you a copy ? " " Yes . Yes thank you . I 'll check it out through our sources for accuracy . " " They 're accurate , Rog . Of course top secret , yes ? I do n't want my guysblown like Fong-fong . We 'll keep this between you'n me , okay ? " " All right . " The American got up and put out his hand . " And Rog , I 'm sorry about the raid . " " Yes . " " Good . As to this joker , Lim , we 'll find him . " Rosemont stretched wearilythen went and poured himself another drink . " Rog ? "  |p829  " No thanks , I 'll be off , " Crosse said . Rosemont stabbed a blunt finger at the letters . " About those , thanks . Yeah , thanks but . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage . " SometimesI 'm so sick to my stomach what our own guys ' 11 do for goddamn dough even if it 's a goddamn pile of goddamn gold I 'd like to die . You know what I mean ? " " Oh yes ! " Crosse kept his voice kind and gentle but he was thinking , How naive you are , Stanley ! In a moment he left and went to police HQ and checked out the fingerprints in his private files , then got back into his car and headed haphazardly toward West Point . When he was sure that he was not being followed , he stopped at the next phone booth and dialed . In a moment the phone was picked up at the other end . No answer , just breathing . At once Crosse coughed Arthur 's dry hacking cough and spoke in a perfect imitation of Arthur 's voice . " Mr. Lop-sing please . " " There 's no Mr. Lop-ting here . Sorry , you have a wrong number . " Contentedly Crosse recognized Suslev . " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same voice that both he and Jason Plumm used on the telephone , both of them finding it very useful to be able to pretend to be Arthur whenever necessary , thus further covering each other and their real identities . When the code was complete , Suslev said , " And ? " Crosse smiled thinly , glad to be able to dupe Suslev . " I 've read the material . So has Our Friend . " Our friend was Arthur 's code name for himself , Roger Crosse . " Ah ! And ? " " And we both agree it 's excellent . " Excellent was a code word meaning counterfeit or false information . A long pause . " So ? " " Can our friend contact you , Saturday at four ? " Can Roger Crosse contactyou tonight at io:oo P.M. at safe phones ? " Yes . Thank you for calling . " Yes . Message understood . Crosse replaced the receiver . He took out another coin and dialed again . " Hello ? " " Hello , Jason , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh hello , Superintendent , this 's a pleasant surprise , " Plumm replied . " Is our bridge game still on for tomorrow ? " Did you make the intercept of the AMG files ? " Yes , " Crosse said , then added casually , " But instead of six could we make it eight ? " Yes , but we 're safe , no names were mentioned . There was a great sigh of relief . Then Plumm said , " Shall I tell the others ? " Do we meet tonight as arranged ? " No , no need to disturb them tonight , we can do that tomorrow . " No . We 'll meet tomorrow.  |p830  " Fine . Thank you for calling . " Crosse went back down the crowded street . Very pleased with himself , he got into his car and lit a cigarette . I wonder what Suslev  --  or his bosses  --  would think if they knew I was the real Arthur , not Jason Plumm . Secretswithin secrets within secrets and Jason the only one who knows who Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious . They do n't like secrets they 're not party to . And they 'd be even more furious if they knew it was I who inducted Plumm and formed Sevrin , not the other way around . It had been easy to arrange . When Crosse was in Military Intelligence in Germany at the tail end of the war , information was whispered to him privately that Plumm , a signals expert , was operating a clandestine transmitterfor the Soviets . Within a month he had got to know Plumm and had established the truth of this but almost immediately the war had ended . So he had docketed the information for future use  --  to barter with , or against a time he might want to switch sides . In espionage you never know when you 're being set up , or betrayed , or being sold for something or someone more valuable . You always need secrets to barter with , the more important the secrets the safer you are , because you never know when you or an underling or overling will make the mistake that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly . Like Voranski . Like Metkin . Like Dunross with his phony files . Like Rosemont with his naive idealism . Like Gregor Suslev , his fingerprints from the glass now on recordwith the CIA and so in a trap of my own choosing . Crosse laughed aloud . He let in the clutch , easing out into the traffic . Switching sides and playing them all off against each other makes life exciting , he told himself . Yes , secrets really do make life very exciting indeed.  |p8319:45  P.M. : Pok Liu Chau was a small island southwest of Aberdeen , and dinner the best Chinese food Bartlett had ever had . They were on their eighth course , small bowls of rice . Traditionally rice was the last dish at a banquet . " You 're not really supposed to eat any , Line ! " Orlanda laughed . " That sort of dramatizes to your host that you 're full to bursting ! " " You can say that again , Orlanda ! Quillan , it 's been fantastic ! " " Yes , yes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose beautifully . " The restaurant was beside a small wharf near a fishing village  --  drab and lit with bare bulbs and furnished with oilcloth on the tables and bad chairs and broken tiles on the floor . Behind it was an alley of fish tanks where the daily catch of the island was kept for sale . Under the proprietor'sdirection they chose from what was swimming in the tanks : prawns , squid , shrimps , lobster , small crabs and fish of all kinds of shapes and sizes . Gornt had argued with the proprietor over the menu , settling with what fish they could agree on . Both were experts and Gornt a valued customer . Later they had sat down at a table on the patio . It was cool and they drank beer , happy together , the three of them . All knew that at least duringdinner there was a truce and no need for guards . In moments the first dish had arrived  --  mounds of succulent quick-fried shrimps , sea-sweet and as delicious as any in the world . Then tiny octopus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the East . Then some chicken wings deep fried which they ate with sea salt , then the great fish steamed with soy and slivers of fresh green onions and ginger and laid on a platter , the cheek , the delicacy of the fish , given to Bartlett as the honored guest . " Jesus , when I saw this dump , sorry , this place , I figured you were putting me on . " " Ah , my dear fellow , " Gornt said , " you have to know the Chinese . They are n't concerned with the surroundings , just the food . They 'd bep832very suspicious of any eating place that wasted money on decoration or tableclothsor candles . They want to see what they eat  --  hence the harsh light . Chinese are at their best eating . They 're like Italians . They love to laugh and eat and drink and belch .... " They all drank beer . " That goes best with Chinese food though Chinesetea 's better  --  it 's more digestive and breaks down all the oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . She was sitting between them . " No reason . It 's just that you really know how to eat here . Say , what'sthis ? " She peered at the dish of fried rice mixed with various kinds of fish . " Squid . " " What ? " The others laughed and Gornt said , " The Chinese say if its back faces heaven it 's edible . Shall we go ? " As soon as they were back on board and out to sea , away from the wharf , there was coffee and brandy . Gornt said , " Will you excuse me for a while ? I 've got some paper work to do . If you 're cold , use the forward stateroom . " He went below . Thoughtfully Bartlett sipped his brandy . Orlanda was across from him and they were lounging in the deck chairs on the aft deck . Suddenly he wished that this was his boat and they were alone . Her eyes were on him . Without being asked , she moved closer and put her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently and expertly . " That feels great , " he said , wanting her . " Ah , " she replied , very pleased , " I 'm very good at massage , Linc . I took lessons from a Japanese . Do you have a regular massage ? " " No . " " You should . It 's very important for your body , very important to keep every muscle tuned . You tune your aircraft , do n't you ? So why not your body ? Tomorrow I 'll arrange it for you . " Her nails dug into his neck mischievously . " She 's a woman , but not to be touched , heya ! " " Come on , Orlanda ! " " I was teasing , silly , " she told him at once , brightly , taking away the sudden tension easily . " This woman 's blind . In olden days in China and even today in Taiwan , blind people are given a monopoly on the art and business of massage , their fingers being their eyes . Oh yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who pretend to have knowledge but do n't , not really . In Hong Kong you soon know who 's real and who is n't . This is a very tiny village . " She leaned forward and brushed her lips against his neck . " That 's because you 're beautiful . " He laughed . " I 'm supposed to say that . " He put his arm around her , bewitched , and gave her a little hug , very conscious of the captain at the helm ten feet away . " Would you like to go forward and see the rest of the ship ? " she asked . He stared at her . " You a mind reader too ? "  |p833She  laughed , her lovely face a mirror of joy . " Is n't it the girl 's part to notice if her . . . if her date 's happy or sad or wanting to be alone or whatever ? I was taught to use my eyes and senses , Linc . Certainly I try to read your mind but if I 'm wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if I 'm correct . . . does n't that make it grander for you ? " And so much easier to ensnare you beyond escape . To control you on a line you can so easily break if you wish , my art being to make the too thin line like a steel mesh . Oh but that was not easy to learn ! Quillan was a cruel teacher , oh so cruel . Much of my education was done in anger , Quillan cursing me , " For chrissake ca n't you ever learn to use your bloody eyes ? It should have been crystal clear when I came here that I was feeling rotten and had a rotten day ! Why the hell did n't you get me a drink at once , touch me gently at once and then keep your bloody mouth shut for ten minutes while I recoup  --  just tender and understanding for ten bloody minutes and then I 'd be fine again ! " " But Quillan , " she had whimpered through her tears , frightened by his rage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th  --  " " I 've told you fifty times not to be upset just because I 'm bloody upset ! It 's your job to take the tension out of me ! Use your bloody eyes and ears and sixth sense ! All I need 's ten minutes and I 'm docile again and putty . For chrissake , do n't I watch over you all the time ? Do n't I use my bloody eyes and try to defuse you ? Every month at the same time you 're always edgy , eh ? Do n't I take care to be as calm as possible then and keep you calmed ? Eh ? " " Yes but d  --  " " To hell with but ! By God , now I 'm in a worse temper than when I came in ! It 's your bloody fault because you 're stupid , unwomanly , and you of all people should know better ! " Orlanda remembered how he had slammed out of the apartment and she had burst into tears , the birthday dinner she had cooked ruined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calm now , and had taken her into his arms and held her tenderly as she wept , sorry for the row that she agreed was unnecessary and her fault . " Listen , Orlanda , " he had said so gently . " I 'm not the only man you 'll have to control in this life , not the only one on whom you 'll depend  --  it 's a basic fact that women depend on some man , however rotten and evil and difficult . It 's so easy for a woman to be in control . Oh so easy if you use your eyes , understand that men are children and , from time to time  --  most of the time  --  stupid , petulant and awful . But they supply the money and it 's hard to do that , very hard . It 's very hard to keep supplying the money day after day whoever you are . Moh ching moh meng . . . no money no life . In return the woman 's got to supply the harmony  --  the man ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always cheer her man if she wants to , can always take the poison out of him . Always . Just by being calm and loving and tender and under/standing for such a short time . I 'll teach you the game of life . You 'll have a Ph.D . in survival , as a woman , but you 've got to work ... " Oh how I worked , Orlanda thought grimly , remembering all her tears . But now I know . Now I can do instinctively what I forced myself to learn . " Come on , let me show you the forward part of the ship . " She got up , conscious of the captain 's eyes , and led the way confidently . As they walked she slipped her arm momentarily in Linc 's , then took the railing of the gangway and went below . The stateroom was big , with comfortable chaises and sofas and deep chairs fixed to the deck . The cocktailcabinet was well stocked . " The galley 's forward in the fo'c'sle with the crew quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hong Kong . " A small corridor led forward . Four cabins , two with a double bunk , two with bunks one over the other . Neat and shipshape and inviting . " Aft 's Quillan'smaster stateroom and the master suite . It 's luxurious . " She smiled thoughtfully . " He enjoys the best . " " Yes , " Bartlett said . He kissed her and she responded , fully responded . His desire made her limp and liquid and she let herself go into his desire , matching his passion , certain that he would stop and that she would not have to stop him . The game had been planned that way . She felt his strength . At once her loins pressed closer , moving slightly . His hands roved her and hers responded . It was glorious in his arms , better than she had ever known with Quillan who was always teacher , always in control , always unsharable . They were on the bunk when Bartlett backed off . Her body cried out for his , but still she exulted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him say , his voice throaty . Corot crossed the fine stateroom and went into the master suite and locked the door behind him . The girl was sweetly asleep in the huge bed under the light blanket . He stood at the foot of the bed , enjoying the sight of her before he touched her . She came out of sleep slowly . " Ayeeyah , I slept so well , Honored Sir . Your bed is so inviting , " she said in Shanghainesewith a smile and a yawn and stretched gloriously as a kitten would stretch . " Did you eat well ? " " Excellently , " he replied in the same language . " Was yours equally fine ? " " Oh yes , delicious ! " she said politely . " Boat Steward Cho brought the same dishes you had . I particularly liked the octopus with black bean and garlic sauce . " She sat up in the bed and leaned against the silk pillows , quite naked . " Should I get dressed and come on deck now ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bed and reached out and touched her breasts and felt a little shiver run through her . Her Chinese hostess name was Beauty of the Snow and he had hired her for the eveningfrom the Happy Hostess Night Club . He had considered bringingp835Mona Leung , his present girl friend instead , but she would be far too independentto remain below happily and only come on deck at his whim . He had chosen Beauty of the Snow very carefully . Her beauty was extraordinary , in face and body and the texture of her skin . She was eighteen , and had been in Hong Kong barely a month . A friend in Taiwan had told him about her rarity and said that she was about to join the Happy Hostess Night Club from the sister club in Taiwan . Two weeks ago he had gone there and made an arrangement that had proved profitableto both of them . Tonight when Orlanda had told him she was dining with Bartlett and he had invited them aboard , at once he had called the Happy Hostess and bought Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurried her aboard . " I 'm playing a game on a friend tonight , " he had told her . " I want you to stay here in this cabin , in this place , until I bring you on deck . It may be an hour or two but you are to stay here , quiet as a mouse , until I fetch you . " " Ayeeyah , in this floating palace , I am prepared to stay a week without charge . Just my food and more of the champagne . . . though pillowing would be extra . May I sleep in the bed if I wish ? " " Certainly , but please shower first . " " A shower ? Bless all gods ! Hot and cold water ? That will be paradise  --  this water shortage is very unhygienic . " Gornt had brought her tonight to taunt Orlanda if he decided he wanted to taunt her . Beauty of the Snow was much younger , prettier , and he knew that the sight of her wearing one of the elegant robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spasm . All through dinner , he had chortled to himself , wondering when he should produce her for maximumeffect : to excite Bartlett and to remind Orlanda that she was already old by Hong Kong standards , and that without his active help she would never get Bartlett , not the way she wanted . Do I want her married to Bartlett ? he asked himself , bemused . No . And yet , if Orlanda were Bartlett 's wife he would always be in my power because she is and ever will be . So far she has n't forgotten that . So far she 's been obedient and filial . And frightened . He laughed . Oh revenge will be sweet when I lower the boom on you , my dear . As I will , one day . Oh yes , my dear , I have n't forgotten the snickers of all those smug bastards  --  Pug , Plumm , Havergill or Ian bloody Dunross  --  when they heard that you could n't wait to leap into bed with a stud half my age . Should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Orlanda was thirteen her Shanghainese mother had come to see him . " Times are very hard , Lord , our debts to the company are huge and your patience and kindness overwhelm us . " " Times are bad for everyone , " he had told her . " Unfortunately , since last week , my husband 's department no longerp836exists . At the end of the month he is to leave , after seventeen years of service , and we can not pay our debts to you . " " Eduardo Ramos is a good man and will easily find a new and better position . " " Yin ksiao ship ta , " she had said : We lose much because of a small thing . " Joss , " he had said , hoping the trap was sprung and all the seeds he had sown would , at long last , bear fruit . " Joss , " she had agreed . " But there is Orlanda . " " What about Orlanda ? " " Perhaps she could be a mui jai . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creditor forever , in settlement for debts that could not otherwisebe paid  --  to be brought up as the creditor wished , or used or given away as the creditor wished . It was an ancient Chinese custom , and quite legal . Gomt remembered the glow he had felt . The negotiations had taken several weeks . Gornt agreed to cancel Ramos 's debts  --  the debts that Gornt had so carefully encouraged , agreed to reinstate Ramos , giving the man a modest guaranteed pension and help in setting up in Portugal , and to pay for Orlanda 's schooling in America . In return the Ramoses guaranteed to provide Orlanda to him , virgin and suitably enamored , on or before her eighteenth birthday . There would be no refusal . " This , by all the gods , will be a perpetual secret between us . I think , too , it would be equally betterto keep it secret from her , Lord , forever . But we know and she will know where her rice bowl lies . " Gornt beamed . The good years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved . Everyone gained , he told himself , and there is enjoyment yet to come . Yes , he thought and concentrated on Beauty of the Snow . " Life is very good , " he said , fondling her . " I am happy you 're happy , Honored Sir . I am happy too . Your shower was a gift of the gods . I washed my hair , everything . " She smiled . " If you do n't want me to play the prank yet on your friends , would you care to pillow ? " " Yes , " he said , delighted as always by the forthrightness of a Chinese pillow partner . His father had explained it early : " You give them money , they give you their youth , the Clouds and the Rain and entertain you . In Asia it 's a fair and honorable exchange . The more their youth , the more the laughter and gratification , the more you must pay . That 's the bargain , but do n't expect romance or real tears  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pillowing . Do n't abuse the fairness ! " Happily Gornt took off his clothes and lay beside her . She ran her hands over his chest , the hair dark , muscles sleek , and began . Soon she was making the small noises of passion , encouraging him . And though shep837had been told by the mama-san that this quai loh was different and there was no need to pretend , instinctively she was remembering the first rule of being a pillow partner to strangers : " Never let your body become involved with a customer for then you can not perform with taste or daring . Never forget , when with a quai loh , you must always pretend to enjoy him greatly , always pretend to achieve the Clouds and the Rain , otherwise he 'll consider that somehow it 's an affront to his masculinity . Quai loh are uncivilized and will never understand that the yin can not be bought and that your gift of coupling is for the customer 's enjoyment solely . " When Gornt was finished and his heart had slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the bathroom and showered again , singinghappily . In euphoria he rested and put his hands under his head . Soon she came back with a towel . " Thank you , " he said and dried himself and she slid in beside him once more . " Oh I feel so clean and marvelous . Shall we pillow again ? " " Not now , Beauty of the Snow . Now you can rest and I will let my mind wander . You have settled the yang very favorably . I will inform the mama-san . " " Thank you , " she said politely . " I would like you as my special cus-tomer . " He nodded , pleasured by her and her warmth and sensuousness . When would it be best for her to come on deck ? he asked himself again , quite confident that Bartlett and Orlanda would be there now and not in bed as a civilized person would be . A chuckle went through him . There was a porthole beside the bed and he could see the lights of Kowloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The enginesthrobbed sweetly , and in a moment he got out of the bed and went to the cupboard . In it were some very expensive nightdresses and underthingsand multicolored robes and rich lounging housecoats that he had bought for Orlanda . It amused him to keep them for others to wear . " Make yourself very pretty and put this on . " He gave her a yellow silk , floor-length chong-sam that had been one of Orlanda 's favorites . " Wear nothing underneath . " " Yes , certainly . Oh , how beautiful it is ! " He began to dress . " If my prank works you may keep it , as a bonus , " he said . " Oh ! Oh , then everything will be as you wish , " she said fervently , her open avarice making him laugh . " We 're going to drop my passengers Hong Kong side first . " He pointed out of the porthole . " You see that big freighter , the one tied up at the wharf with the Hammer and Sickle flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ill-omen ? I see it now ! " " When we are broadside please come on deck . " " I understand . What should I say ? "  |p838  " Nothing . Just smile sweetly at the man and the woman , then at me and come below again and wait for me here . " Beauty of the Snow laughed . " Is that all ? " " Yes , just be sweet and beautiful and smile  --  particularly at the woman . " " Ah ! Am I to like her or hate her ? " she asked at once . " Neither , " he said , impressed with her shrewdness , ecstatically aware that they would both loathe each other on sight . In the privacy of his cabin aboard the Sovetsky Ivanov , Captain Gregor Suslev finished encoding the urgent message , then sipped some vodka , rechecking the cable . " Ivanov to Center . Arthur reports the files may be counterfeit . His friend will supply me with copies tonight . Delighted toli it report Arthur 's friend also intercepted the carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had extra copies sent by mail to Bangkok for the pouch , also London and Berlin for safety . " Satisfied , he put the code books back into the safe and locked it , then picked up the phone . " Send me the duty signalman . And the first officer . " He unbolted the cabin door then went back and stared out the porthole at the carrier across the harbor , then saw the passing pleasure cruiser . He recognized the Sea Witch . Idly he picked up his binoculars and focused . He saw Gornt on the aft deck , a girl and another man with his back toward him sitting around a table . His high-powered lenses raked the ship and his envy soared . That bastard knows how to live , he thought . What a beauty ! If only I could have one such as her on the Caspian , berthed at Baku ! Not so much to pray for , he told himself , watching the Sea Witch pass , not after so much service , so profitable to the cause . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group . Another girl came up from below , an Asian beauty , and then there was a polite knock on his door . " Evening , Comrade Captain , " the signalman said . He accepted the messageand signed for it . " Send it at once . " " Yes sir . " The first officer arrived . Vassili Boradinov was a tough , good-looking man in his thirties , captain , KGB , graduate of the espionage department of Vladivostok University with a master mariner 's ticket . " Yes , Comrade Captain ? " Suslev handed him a decoded cable from the pile on his desk . It read : " First Officer Vassili Boradinov will assume Dimitri Metkin 's duties as commissar of the Ivanov but Captain Suslev will be in complete command on all levels until alternate arrangements are made . " " Congratulations , " he said.  |p839Boradinov  beamed . " Yes sir . Thank you . What do you want me to do ? " Suslev held up the key to the safe . " If I fail to contact you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the package marked Emergency One . ' They will tell you how to proceed . Next . . . " He handed him a sealed envelope . " This gives two phone numbers where I can be reached . Open it only in an emergency . " " Very well . " Sweat beaded the younger man 's face . " No need to worry . You 're perfectly capable of taking command . " " I hope that will not be necessary . " Gregor Suslev laughed . " So do I , my young friend . Please sit down . " He poured two vodkas . " You deserve the promotion . " " Thank you . " Boradinov hesitated . " What happened to Metkin ? " " The first thing is he made a stupid and unnecessary mistake . Next , he was betrayed . Or he betrayed himself . Or the god-cursed SI tailed him and caught him . Or the CIA pegged him . Whatever happened , the poor fool should never have exceeded his authority and put himself into such danger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole security . Stupid ! " The first officer shifted nervously in his chair . " What 's our plan ? " " To deny everything . And to do nothing for the moment . We 're due to sail on Tuesday at midnight ; we keep to that plan . " Boradinov looked out of the porthole at the carrier , his face tight . " Pity . That material could have jumped us forward a quantum . " " What material ? " Suslev asked , his eyes narrowing . " Did n't you know , sir ? Before Dimitri left , the poor fellow whispered he 'd heard that this time we were to get some incredible information  --  a copy of the guidance system and a copy of their armament manifest , includingatomics  --  that 's why he was going himself . It was too important to trust to an ordinary courier . I must tell you I volunteered to go in his place . " Suslev covered his shock that Metkin had confided in anyone . " Where did he hear that ? " The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presume the American sailor told him when Dimitri took the call at the phone box to arrange the drop . " He wiped a bead of sweat away . " They 'll break him , wo n't they ? " " Oh yes , " Suslev said thinly , wanting his subordinate suitably indoctrinated . " They can break anyone . That 's why we have to be prepared . " He fingered the slight bulge of the poison capsule in the point of his lapel and Boradinov shuddered . " Better to have it quickly . " " Bastards ! They must have been tipped to capture him before he did it . Terrible . They 're all animals . " " Did . . . did Dimitri say anything else ? Before he left ? " " No , just that he hoped we 'd all get a few weeks ' leave  --  he wanted to visit his family in his beloved Crimea . " Satisfied that he was covered , Suslev shrugged . " A great pity . I liked him very much . "  |p840  " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so soon . He was a good man even though he made such a mistake . What will they do to him ? " Suslev considered showing Boradinov one of the other decoded cables on his desk that said in part : " . . . Advise Arthur that , following his request for a Priority One on the traitor Metkin , an immediate intercept was ordered for Bombay . " No need to give away that information , he thought . The less Boradinov knows the better . " He 'll just vanish  --  until we catch a bigger fish of theirs to use as an exchange . The KGB looks after their own , " he added piously , not believing it , knowing that the younger man did not believe it either , but the saying of it was obligatory and policy . They 'd have to exchange me , he thought , very satisfied . Yes , and very quickly . I know too many secrets . They 're my only protection . If it was n't for what I know they 'd order a Priority One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So would I if I was them . Would I have bit my lapel as that stupidturd should have done ? A shudder went through him . I do n't know . He sipped his vodka . It tasted very good to him . I do n't want to die . This life is too good . " You 're going ashore again , Comrade Captain ? " " Yes . " Suslev concentrated . He handed the younger man a note he had typed and signed . " You 're in command now . Here 's your authority  --  post it on the bridge . " " Thank you . Tomorr  --  " Boradinov stopped as the ship 's intercom came on and the urgent voice said rapidly : " This 's the bridge ! There 're two police cars converging on the main gangway filled with police . . . " Both Suslev and Boradinov blanched . " . . about a dozen of them . What should we do ? Stop them , repel them , what do we do ? " Suslev jerked the sending switch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ship 's intercom . " All hands : Emergency , Red One . . . " This order meant : " Hostile visitors are coming aboard . Radio and radar rooms : arm destructs on all secret equipment . " He switched the sender off and hissed at Boradinov , " Go on deck , down the gangway , greet them , delay for five minutes then invite the leaders aboard , only them if you can . Go on ! " " Surely they dare n't come aboard to sear  --  " " Intercept them  --  now ! " Boradinov rushed out . Once alone Suslev armed the secret destruct on his safe . If anyone but him tried to open it now its incendiary napalm would obliterate everything . He tried to put his panicked mind at ease . Think ! Is everything covered against a sudden search ? Yes . Yes we 've done the Red One drill a dozen times . But God curse Roger Crosse and Arthur ! Why the devil did n't we get a warning ? Was Arthur caught ? Or Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ab  --   |p841His  eyes caught the pile of coded and decoded cables . Frantically he scooped them into an ashtray , cursing himself for not doing it earlier , not knowing if there was enough time now . He found his lighter . His fingers were trembling . The lighter flamed as the intercom crackled on : " Two men 're coming aboard with Boradinov , two men , the rest 're staying below . " " All right , but delay them . I 'll come on deck . " Suslev doused the flame with a curse and stuffed the cables in his pocket . He grabbed a half-empty vodka bottle , and took a deep breath , put a broad beam on his face and went on deck . " Ah , welcome aboard ! What 's the trouble , eh ? " he said , a slight slur now in his voice , keeping up his well-known cover . " One of our sailors has himself in trouble , Superintendent Armstrong ? " " This is Mr. Sun . May we have a word with you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suslev said with a forced joviality he did not feel . He had never seen the Chinese before . He examined the cold-eyed , sallow , hate-filled face . " Follow me please , " he said , then added in Russian to Boradinov who spoke perfect English , " You too , " then again to Armstrong with continuing forced good humor , " Who 's going to win the fifth race , Superintendent ? " " I wish I knew , sir . " Suslev led the way to the small wardroom that adjoined his cabin . " Sit down , sit down . Can I offer you tea or vodka ? Orderly , bring tea and vodka ! " They came quickly . Expansively Suslev poured vodka even though the two policemen refused politely . " Prosit , " he said and laughed jovially . " Not what 's the trouble ? " " It seems that one of your crew is engaged in espionage against Her Majesty 's Government , " Armstrong said politely . " Impossible , tovarich ! Why joke with me , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Government is really quite upset . " " This is a peaceful freighter , trading . You 've known us for years . YourSuperintendent Crosse has watched us for years . We do n't deal in espio-nage . " " How many of your crew are ashore , sir ? " " Six . Now listen , I do n't want any trouble . I 've had enough cursed trouble this voyage already with one of my innocent seamen murdered by unkn  --  " " Ah yes , the late Major Yuri Bakyan of the KGB . Very unfortunate . " Suslev pretended sullen anger . " His name was Voranski . I know nothing of this major you talk about . I know nothing about that , nothing . " " Of course . Now , sir , when are your sailors back from shore leave ? " " Tomorrow , at dusk . " " Where are they staying ? " Suslev laughed . " They 're ashore , on leave . Where else should they be but with a girl or in a bar ? With a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not all of them are , " Armstrong said coldly . " At least one is very miserableright now . " Suslev watched him , glad that he knew Metkin was gone forever and they could not bluff him . " Come now , Superintendent , I know nothing about any espionage . " Armstrong put the eight-by-ten photos on the table . They showed Metkingoing into the restaurant , then under guard , then being hustled into the Black Maria , then a mug shot of him , tenor in the face . " Kristosl " Suslev gasped , a consummate actor . " Dimitri ? It 's impossible ! It 's another false arrest ! I will have my gov  --  " " It 's already been reported to your government in London . Major NicoliLeonov admitted espionage . " Now Suslev 's shock was real . He had never expected Metkin to break so quickly . " Who ? Who did you say ? " Armstrong sighed . " Major Nicoli Leonov of your KGB . That 's his real name and rank . He was also political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . yes that is true but his . . . his name is Metkin , Dimitri Metkin . " " Oh ? You have no objection if we search this ship ? " Armstrong began to get up . Suslev was aghast , Boradinov equally . " Oh yes I object , " Suslev stuttered . " Yes , Superintendent , so sorry but I formally object , and I mu  --  " " If your ship is not engaged in espionage and is a peaceful freighter why should you object ? " " We have international protections . Unless you have a formal search warrant th  --  " Armstrong 's hand went into his pocket and Suslev 's stomach turned over . He would have to comply with a formal warrant and then he would be ruined because they would find more evidence than even they could ever hope for . That god-cursed son of a whore hitch Metkin must 've told them something vital . He wanted to shout in rage , the decoded and coded messages in his pocket suddenly lethal . His face had gone white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket with only a pack of cigarettes . Suslev 's heart began again though his nausea still almost overwhelmed him . " Matyeryebyets ! " he muttered . " Sir ? " Armstrong asked innocently . " Is anything the matter ? " " No , no , nothing . " " Would you care for an English cigarette ? " Suslev fought for control , wanting to smash the other man for tricking him . Sweat was on his back and on his face . He took the cigarette shakily . " These things are . . . are terrible , eh ? Espionage and searches and threats of searches . " " Yes . Perhaps you 'd be kind enough to leave tomorrow , not Tuesday . " " Impossible ! Are we being hounded like rats ? " Suslev blustered , notp843knowing how far he dare go . " I will have to inform my government and th  --  " " Please do . Please tell them we have intercepted Major Leonov of the KGB , caught him in an espionage act , and that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped the sweat off his face , trying to stay calm . Only the knowledge that Metkin was probably dead now kept him in one piece . But what else did he tell them , he was shrieking in his head , what else ? He looked at Boradinov who was standing beside him , white-faced . " Who 're you ? " Armstrong asked sharply , following his glance . " First Officer Boradinov , " the younger man said , his voice strangled . " Who 's the new commissar , Captain Suslev ? Who took over from your Mr. Leonov ? Who 's the senior Party man aboard ? " Boradinov went ashen and Suslev was thankful that some of the pressure was turned off him . " Well ? " Suslev said , " He is . First Officer Boradinov . " At once Armstrong put his icy eyes on the younger man . " Your full name please ? " " Vassili Boradinov , first officer , " the man stuttered . " Very well , Mr. Boradinov , you 're responsible for getting this ship under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally warned we have reason to believe there might be an attack on you by triads  --  by Chinesebandits . The rumor is the attack 's planned for the early hours of Monday  --  just after midnight Sunday . It 's a very strong rumor . Very . There are lots of Chinese bandits in Hong Kong , and Russians have stolen lots of Chinese land . We are concerned for your safety and health . I suggest it politic . . . eh ? " Boradinov was ashen . " Yes , yes , I understand . " " But my . . . my repairs , " Suslev began , " if my repai  --  " " Please see they 're completed , Captain . If you need extra help or a tow outside Hong Kong waters , just ask . Oh yes , and would you be kind enough to appear at police headquarters at zo:oo A.M. Sunday  --  sorry about the weekend . " Suslev blanched . " Eh ? " " Here 's your formal invitation . " Armstrong handed him an official letter . Suslev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second copy , wrote in Boradinov 's name . " Here 's yours , Commissar Boradinov . " He shoved it into his hand . " I suggest you confine the rest of your crew aboard  --  with the exception of yourselves of course  --  and bring your shore party back right smartly . I 'm sure you 'll have lots to do . Good night ! " he added with startling suddenness , got up and went out of the wardroom , closing the door behind him . There was a stunned silence . Suslev saw Malcolm Sun get up and lei/surely head for the door . He got up to follow but stopped as the Chinesewhirled on them . " We 'll get you , all of you ! " Sun said malevolently . " For what ? We 've done nothing , " Boradinov gasped . " We 've d  --  " " Espionage . Spying ? You KGB think you 're so clever , matyeryebyets ! " " You get to hell off my ship , " Suslev snarled . " We 'll get you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Abruptly Malcolm Sun switched to fluent Russian . " Get out of our lands , hegemonists ! China 's on the march ! We can lose fifty million soldiers , a hundred and still have double that left . Get out while you 've time ! " " We 'll blast you off the earth ! " Suslev bellowed . " We 'll atomize all China . We 'll to  --  " He stopped . Malcolm Sun was laughing at him . " Your mother 's tit in your atomics ! We 've our own atomics now ! You start we finish . Atomics , fists , ploughshares ! " Malcolm Sun 's voice dropped . " Get out of China while you 've the chance . We 're coming out of the East like Genghis Khan , all of us , Mao Tse-tung , Chiang Kai-shek , me , my grandsons , their grandsons , we 're coming and we 'll clean you off the earth and take back all our lands , all of them ! " " Get off my ship ! " Suslev felt his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurl himself at his tormentor , Boradinov as well . Unafraid , Malcolm Sun came back a pace . " Yeb tvoyu mat ' Turdhead ! " Then in English , " Hit me and I 'll arrest you for assault and impound your ship ! " With a great effort the two men stopped . Choked with rage , Suslev stuffed his fists into his pockets . " Please , you will . . . you will leave . Please . " " Dew neh loh moh on you , your mother , your father and the whole of your turd-eating Soviet hegemonists ! " " You  --  will  --  leave  --  now . " Equally enraged , Sun cursed them in Russian and shouted back , " We 're coming out of the East like locusts . . . . " Then there was a suddennoisy altercation outside on deck and a slight dull boom . At once he turned and went for the door , the other two rushing after him . Appalled , Suslev saw that now Armstrong was standing at the doorway of the radio room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst open , the two frightened operators staring at the Englishman , aghast , paralyzed deckhand guards nearby . Already the beginning of smoke was welling from the innards of the radio equipment . Red One ordered the senior radio man to trigger the destruct on the secret scrambling device the instanta hostile opened the door or tried to break the lock . Armstrong turned to face Suslev . " Ah , Captain , so sorry , I stumbled . So sorry , " he said innocently . " I thought this was the loo . " " What ? " " The toilet . I stumbled and the door burst open . So sorry . " The police/man glanced back into the radio room . " Good God ! It seems there 's a fire . I 'll call the fire brigade at once . Malcolm , get th  --  " " No . . . no ! " Suslev said , then snarled in Russian to Boradinov and the deck crew , " Get the fire out ! " He jerked a fist out of his pocket and shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his decoded cables and it fell on to the deck . Smoke was pouring out from behind one of the complex radio panels . Already one of the deckhands had a fire extinguisher . " Dear oh dear ! What could have happened ? You 're sure you do n't want assistance ? " Armstrong asked . " No , no thank you , " Suslev said , his face mottled with rage , " thank you , Superintendent . I 'll . . . I 'll see you Sunday . " " Good night , sir . Come along , Malcolm . " In the growing confusion Armstrong headed for the gangway but stooped and before Suslev realized what was happening picked up the piece of paper and was halfway down the gangway , Malcolm Sun following him . Appalled , Suslev 's hand went to his pocket . Forgetting the fire he rushed into his cabin to check which cable was missing . Below on the wharf , uniformed police had long since fanned out , coveringboth gangways . Armstrong was getting into the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MI-6 were dark-rimmed and his suit a little rumpled but he was icily alert . " Well done , you two ! Yes . I imagine that 'll interrupt their communications for a day or so . " " Yes sir . " Armstrong began rummaging in his pocket for his lighter , his heart pounding . Sinders watched Malcolm Sun get into the driver 's seat . " What 's the matter ? " he asked thoughtfully , seeing his face . " Nothing , nothing really , sir . " Malcolm Sun craned around , the sweat on his back , his heart hurting and the sick-sweet excitement rage-fear taste still in his mouth . " When . . . when I was conducting delaying tactics for the superintendent I . . . they got me going , those two bastards . " " Oh ? How ? " " Just . . . they started cursing , so I . . . I just cursed them back . " Sun faced the front , settled himself , not wanting Sinders 's penetrating eyes on his . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pity one of them did n't hit you . " " Yes , yes I was ready . " Sinders glanced at Armstrong briefly as the big man clicked the lighter on , lit a cigarette and , under the light of the flame , peered at the paper . Sinders glanced up at the ship above . Once more Suslev was standing at the head of the gangway staring down at them . " He looks very angry indeed . Good . " The flicker of a smile went over him . " Very good . " With Sir Geoffrey 's approval he had ordered the sudden arrival and attempt to disruptthe Ivanov 's communications  --  and complacency  --  to put pressure onp846Arthur and the Sevrin moles , hoping to flush them out . " And our police mole , " Sir Geoffrey had added grimly . " It 's impossible that Brian Kwok 's the spy mentioned in the AMG papers . Eh ? " " I agree , " he had said . Armstrong clicked the lighter off . In the semidarkness of the car he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Malcolm . No need to waste any more time here . All right , Mr. Sinders ? " " Yes . Yes we can go now . " Obediently Malcolm Sun left . Armstrong was watching Suslev on the deck . " You , er , you read Russian , do n't you sir ? " " Yes , yes I do . Why ? " Carefully Armstrong passed over the paper , holding it by the edges . " This fell out of Suslev 's pocket . " Equally carefully Sinders took the paper but his eyes never left Armstrong 's . " You do n't trust senior agent , Sun ? " he asked softly . " Yes . Oh yes . But Chinese are Chinese and it 's in Russian . I do n't read Russian . " Sinders frowned . After a moment he nodded . Armstrong lit the flame for him . The older man scanned the paper twice and sighed . " It 's a weather report , Robert . Sorry . Unless it 's in code , it 's just a meteorological report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creases . " The fingerprintsmight be valuable . Perhaps it 's code . Just for safety I 'll pass it on to our cipher fellows . " Sinders settled back more comfortably in the car . The paper had read : " Advise Arthur that , following his request for a Priority One on the traitor Metkin , an immediate intercept was ordered for Bombay . Second , the meeting with the American is brought forward to Sunday . Third and final , the AMG files continue to be Priority One . Maximum effort must be made by Sevrin to achieve success . Center . " Now which American ! Sinders asked himself patiently , and is it Arthur 's meeting or whose ? Captain Suslev ? Is he as innocent as he appears ? Which American ? Bartlett , Tcholok , Banastasio or who ? Peter Marlowe  --  **29;8145;TOOLONG with his curious theories ? Did Bartlett or Tcholok make contact with Center in June in Moscow when they were there , with or without Peter Marlowe , who also happened to be there when a highly secret meeting of foreign agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all but someone who lives here in Hong Kong ? Is it Rosemont ? Or Langan ? Both would be perfect . So much to wonder about . Like who 's the fourth man ? Who 's the VVIP above Philby ? Where will those threads lead ? Into Burke 's Peerage ? Perhaps to some castle , or even a palace ?  |p847Who  's this mysterious Mrs. Gresserhoff who took Kiernan 's second call and then vanished like a smoke ring ? And what about those bloody files ? What about bloody AMG and bloody Dunross trying to be so bloody clever ... . It was getting toward midnight and Dunross and Casey were sitting happily side-by-side in the glassed-in forward section of one of the Golden Ferries , which swerved confidently toward its berth Kowloon side . It was a good night though the clouds still scudded low . Canvas storm panels still closed in and protected the open part of the decks , but here where they were , the view was good and a fine sea-salt breeze came through one of the open windows . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breaking their comfortable silence . " Oh yes . But I certainly hope the heavy stuff stays away till late tomorrow afternoon . " " You and your races ! Are they that important ? " " To all Hong Kong yan , oh yes . To me , yes and no . " " I 'll put my entire fortune on your Noble Star . " " I would n't do that , " he said . " You should always hedge a bet . " Casey glanced across at him . " Some bets you do n't hedge . " " Some bets you ca n't hedge , " he said , correcting her with a smile . Casuallyhe lifted her arm and linked his with hers and settled his hand back in his lap . The contact pleased both of them . It was their first real touch . All during their stroll from the Mandarin Hotel to the ferry Casey had wanted to take his arm . But she had fought back the impulse and now she pretended not to notice their interlinking though , instinctively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you never finished your story of George Toffer  --  did you fire him ? " " No , no I never did , not as I thought I would . When we 'd won control I went to his boardroom .

He just waved one of my letters about the money he owed me in my face and shouted that I 'd never get that back , never . " She shrugged . " I never did , hit I got his company . " " What happened to him ? " " He 's still around , still cheating someone . Say , can we stop talking about him , it gives me indigestion . " He laughed . " Perish that thought ! Terrific night , is n't it ? " " Yes . " They had dined impeccably in the Dragon Room atop the skyscraperhotel .

" " Murtagh agreed to try . " It had taken just a few seconds to fix the terms based on the bank 's agreeing to the financing that Casey had laid out as possible : 120 percent of the cost of both ships , a 50 million revolving fund . " Everything covered by your personal guarantee ? " Murtagh had asked . " Yes , " he had said , committing his future and his family 's future . " We , er , I figure with Struan 's great management you 'll make a profit so our money 's secure and . . . but Mr. Dunross , sir , we got ta keep this secretas hell . Meanwhile , I 'll give it the old college try . " Murtagh was trying to hide his nervousness . " Please do , Mr. Murtagh . The very best old college try you can . How about joining me for the races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch , I 'm crammed to the gills and overbooked , but here , here 's a pass if you 're free to join us from 2:30 on . " " Oh Jesus , tai-pan , you mean it ? " Dunross smiled to himself . In Hong Kong an invitation to a steward 's box was like being presented at court , and just as useful . " Why the smile , tai-pan ? " Casey asked , shifting slightly , feeling his warmth . " Because all 's well , at the moment , in the world . At least all the various problems are in their compartments . " Going ashore and out of the ferry terminal he explained his theory that the only way to deal with problems was the Asian way : to put them into individual compartments and take them up only when ready for them . " That 's good , if you can do it , " she said , walking close beside him but not touching now . " If you ca n't you 'll go under  --  ulcers , heart attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A woman cries , that 's her safety valve . She cries and then she feels better . . . . " Casey had wept earlier , before leaving the V and A to meet him . Because of Linc Bartlett . Part rage , part frustration , part longing , and part need  --  physical need . It was six months since she had had one of her rare , very casual and very short affairs . When the need became too strong she would go away for a few days , skiing or sunning and she would choose whom she would allow into her bed . Then , as quickly , she would forget him . " But oh , is n't it very bad , Ciran-chek , " her mother had once said , " to be so callous ? " " Oh no , Mama darling , " she had told her . " It 's a fair exchange . I enjoy sex  --  I mean I enjoy it when I 'm in the mood , though I try to keep the mood as infrequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I th  --  " " How can you love him and go to bed with someone else ? " " It 's , it 's not easy , in fact , it 's awful . But Mama , I work hard for Lincp849all hours , weekends and Sundays , I work hard for all of us , for you and Uncle Tashjian and Marian and the kids , I 'm the wage earner now that Marian 's on her own and I love it , truly I enjoy it , you know I do . But sometimes it all gets too much so I just go away . And that 's when I choose a partner . Honestly , Mama , it 's just biological , there 's no difference that way between us and men , and now that we 've the God-blessed pill we can choose . It 's not like in your day , thank God , my darling . . . " Casey stepped aside to avoid a phalanx of oncoming pedestrians and bumped Dunross slightly . Automatically she took his arm . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon and had been turned down . . . No , that 's not fair , Casey , she told herself . Ian did n't turn me down , he just gave me the truth from his point of view . From mine ? I do n't know . I 'm not sure . But the one thing I 'm not is a fool and so tonight I dressed carefully , a little differently , and put on perfume and made my makeup more definite and tonight I bit my tongue three to thirty times and held back , not giving measure for measure , playing it more conventionally , saying sweetly , " That 's interesting ! " And most times it was . He was attentive , entertaining and receptive and I felt marvelous . Ian 's certainly one helluva man . Dangerous and oh so tempting . The wide marble steps up to the V and A were ahead . Discreetly she let go of his arm and felt nearer to him because of her understanding . " Ian , you 're a wise man . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if you do n't love them ? " " Eh ? " He was startled out of the pleasantness . Then he said lightly , " Love is a Western word , lady . Me , I 'm China-man ! " " Seriously . " He laughed . " I do n't think it 's time to be serious . " " But do you have an opinion ? " " Always . " They went up the stairs into the foyer , crowded even this late . At once he felt many eyes and recognition which was why he had not left her on the steps . Every little helps , he thought . I must seem calm and confident . The Noble House is inviolate ! I will not and can not allow myself the luxuryof normal fear  --  it would spill over and wreck others and do untold damage . " Would you like a nightcap ? " she asked . " I 'm not sleepy . Maybe Linc 'll join us if he 's in . " " Good idea . Tea with lemon would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty table . " Evening , tai-pan . " " Evening , Nighttime Gup . " " Tea and lemon 's fine with me too , " she said . A waiter scurried away . " I 'll just check my messages . " " Of course . " Dunross watched her walk away . Tonight , from the fastp850moment in the Mandarin foyer , he had noticed how much more feminine she had seemed , nothing discernible , just a subtle change . Interesting woman . A sexuality that 's waiting to explode . How the devil can I help her to get her drop dead money quickly ? Nighttime Gup was bustling around and he said quietly in Cantonese , " Tai-pan , we certainly hope you can deal with the stock market and SecondGreat House . " " Thank you . " Dunross chatted awhile , exuding confidence , then his eyes strayed back to Casey at the front desk . Nighttime Gup 's shrewd old eyes twinkled , " The gun-runner 's not in the hotel , tai-pan . " " Eh ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. , I 'd just come on duty , " the neat old man said airily . " The gun-runner was dressed very casually . For a sail I imagine . A girl was with him . " Dunross concentrated now . " There are many girls in Hong Kong , Nighttime Gup . " " Not like this one , tai-pan . " The old man guffawed carefully . " Once she was the mistress of Black Beard . " " Eeeee , old man , you have sharp eyes and a long memory . Are you sure ? " " Oh very sure ! " Nighttime Gup was delighted with the way his news was received . " Yes , " he added loftily , " since we hear the Americans may be joining the Noble House if you can extricate yourself from all those other fornicators it might be good for you to know that . Also that Golden Pubics has moved her ro  --  " " Who ? " Nighttime Gup explained the reason for the nickname . " Can you imagine , tai-pan ? " Dunross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's changed her room ? " " Oh yes , it 's along the corridor , 276 , on the same floor . Eeeee , tai-pan , I heard she was weeping in the night , two nights ago , and again this evening before she left . Yes . Third Toiletmaid Fung saw her crying tonight . " " They had a row ? She and the gun-runner ? " " Oh no , not a row , no shoutings . But , oh ko , if Golden Pubics knows about the Orlanda flower that 's cause enough for dragons to belch . " NighttimeGup smiled toothily at Casey as she came back , a sheaf of cables and messages in her hand . Dunross noticed that now there was a shadow in her eyes . No message from Line Bartlett , he surmised , getting up . NighttimeGup solicitously pulled a chair away for her , poured her tea , continuingin his gutter Cantonese , " Never mind , tai-pan , Golden Pubics or not it 's all the same in the dark , heya ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her papers . " Trouble ? " " Oh no , just more of the same . " She looked at him directly , " I 've gotp851them all compartmentalized for tomorrow . Tonight 's mine . Line 's not back yet . " She sipped her tea , enjoying it . " So I can monopolize you . " " I thought I was doing the monopolizing . Is n't  --  " He stopped as he noticedRobert Armstrong and Sinders come in through the swing doors . The two men stood at the entrance , looking for a table . " Your police work overtime , " Casey said , and , as the men 's gaze fell on them , waved back half-heartedly . The two men hesitated , then went to a vacant table at the other end of the room . " I like Armstrong , " she said . " Is the other man police ? " " I imagine so . Where did you meet Robert ? " She told him . " Still nothing on the smuggled guns . Where they came from or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like a brandy ? " " Why not ? One for the road , then I must be going . Waiter ! " He orderedthe drinks . " The car 'll be here tomorrow at twelve sharp to pick you up . " Thank you . Ian , the invitation read , Ladies Hats and Gloves . ' Do you really mean that ? " " Of course . " He frowned . " Ladies have always worn hats and gloves at the races . Why ? " " I 'll have to buy a hat . I have n't worn one in years . " " Actually , I like ladies in hats . " Dunross glanced around the room . Armstrong and Sinders were watching him covertly . Is it a coincidence they 're here ? he wondered . " You feel the eyes too , tai-pan ? Everyone here seems to know you . " " It 's not me , it 's just the Noble House and what I represent . " The brandy came . " Health ! " They touched glasses . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's yes . " He swirled the brandy in the glass and inhaled it . " Yes what ? " Abruptly he grinned . " Yes nothing , yes it 's not fair but yes it happens all the time and I 'm not going to get into one of those lovely self-analyzing Have you stopped beating your wife recently ? ' things , though I do hear that most ladies like being beaten occasionally but with great care , with or without hats ! " She laughed and most of her shadows vanished . " It depends , does it ? " " It depends ! " He watched her , his calm , easy smile on his face and he was thinking and she was thinking it depends on who and when and where and timing , circumstance and need , and right now it would be grand . He reached out with his glass and touched hers . " Health , " he said . " And here 's to Tuesday . " She smiled back and lifted her glass , her heart quickening . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? "  |p852  " Yes . Yes , I hope so , Ian . " " Well , I 'll be on my way . " " I had a lovely time . " " So did I. " " Thanks for inviting me . Tomorr  --  " She stopped as Nighttime Gup bustled up to them . " Excuse me , tai-pan , telephone . " " Oh , thank you . I 'll be right there . " Dunross sighed . " No peace for the wicked ! Casey , shall we ? " " Sure , sure , tai-pan . " She got up too , her heart beating strongly , a sad sweet ache possessing her . " I 'll take care of the check ! " " Thanks , but that 's already done . They 'll just send it on to the office . " Dunross left a tip and guided her toward the elevator , both of them conscious of the eyes following them . For a second he was tempted to go upstairs with her just to set the tongues wagging . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding me already , he thought . " Good night , Casey , see you tomorrow and do n't forget cocktails 7:3o to 9:00 P.M. Give my best to Linc ! " He waved cheerily and walked for the front desk . She watched him go , tall , immaculate and confident . The elevator doors closed . If this was n't Hong Kong you would n't escape , not tonight , Ian Dunross . Oh no , tonight we 'd make love . Oh yes , yes we would . Dunross stopped at the front desk and picked up the phone . " Hello , this is Dunross . " " Tai-pan ? " " Oh hello , Lim , " he said , recognizing his majordomo 's voice . " What 's up ? " " Mr. Tip Tok-toh just phoned , sir . " Dunross 's heart picked up tempo . " He asked me to try to reach you and would you please call him back . He said you could call him any time before two o'clock or after 7:00 A.M. " " Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said she 's settled your guest ... " There was a rustle of paper . " . . . Mrs. Gresserhoff at the hotel and that your appointment in your office at r z : oo A.M. 'S confirmed . " " Good . Next ? " " Missee called from London  --  everything fine there  --  and a Dr. Samson from London . " " Ah ! " Kathy 's specialist . " Did he leave a number ? " Lim gave it to him and he scribbled it down . " Anything else ? " " No , tai-pan . " " Is Number One Daughter back yet ? " " No , tai-pan . Number One Daughter came in about 7:oo P.M. for a few minutes with a young man and then they left . " " Was it Martin Haply ? " " Yes , yes it was . "  |p853  " Thanks , Urn . I 'll call Tiptop then get a ferry home . " He hung up . Wanting more privacy , he went to the phone booth that was near the stationer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized Tiptop 's voice . " Good evening , this 's Ian Dunross . " " Ah , tai-pan ! Just a minute . " There was the sound of a hand being put over the mouthpiece and muffled voices . He waited . " Ah , sorry to keep you waiting . I 've had some very disquieting news . " " Oh ? " " Yes . It seems your police once again are like dog 's lungs and wolf 's heart . They have falsely arrested a very good friend of yours , SuperintendentBrian Kwok . He  --  " " Brian Kwok ? " Dunross gasped . " But why ? " " I understand he 's been falsely accused of being a spy for the PRC , an  --  " " Impossible ! " " I agree . Ridiculous ! Chairman Mao has no need of capitalist spies . He should be released at once , at once  --  and if he wishes to leave Hong Kong he should be permitted to do so and go wherever he wishes to go . . . at once ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiptop said the man called Brian Kwok was to be released at once and permitted to leave Hong Kong if he wished , then Brian was a PRC spy , one of their spies , and that was impossible impossible impossible . " I . . . I do n't know what to say , " he said , giving Tiptop the opening he required . " I must point out Old Friends could hardly be expected to consider assisting Old Friends when their police are so errored . Heya ? " " I agree , " he heard himself saying with the right amount of concern , his mind shouting , Christ almighty , they want to trade Brian for the money ! " I 'll . . . I 'll talk to the authorities first thing torn  --  " " Perhaps you could do something tonight . " " It 's too late to call the governor now but . . . " Then Dunross rememberedSinders and Armstrong and his heart leaped . " I 'll try . At once . I 'm sure there 's some mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In any event I 'm sure the governor will be helpful . And the police . Surely such a ... a mistake could be handled satisfactorily  --  like the Victoria 's request for the temporary use of the illustrious bank 's cash ? " There was a long silence . " It 's possible that could be done . It 's possible . Old Friends should assist Old Friends , and help correct mistakes . Yes , it could be possible . " Dunross heard the unsaid when left hanging and automatically continuedthe negotiation , most of his mind still beset by what he had been told . " Did you happen to get my note , Mr. Tip ? I 've taken care of everything else . By the way , the Victoria will certainly assist the financing of thep854thorium . " He added delicately , " Also most other further requests  --  at advantageousterms . " " Ah yes , thank you . Yes , I received your note and your very kind invitation . So sorry that I was unwell . Thank you , tai-pan . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was possible ? " " I imagine thirty days would be more than enough , perhaps even two weeks . But it 's the Victoria , Blacs and the other banks and not the Hong Kong Government . I could tell you that tomorrow . Do we have the privilege of seeing you at the races for lunch ? " " I regret not for lunch but perhaps after lunch , if that 's possible . " Dunross smiled grimly . The perfect compromise . " Of course . " " Thank you for calling . By the way , Mr. Yu was most impressed with you , tai pan . " " Please give him my regards . I look forward to seeing him soon . In Canton . " " I was astonished to read your brother-in-law 's comments about the Middle Kingdom . " " Yes . So was I. My wife and her brother have been estranged for years . His views are alien , enemy and totally misguided . " Dunross hesitated . " I hope to neutralize him . " " Yes . Yes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone went dead . Dunross hung up . Christ ! Brian Kwok ! And I 'd almost given him the AMG papers . Christ ! Collecting his wits with a great effort , he went back into the foyer . Armstrong and Sinders were still there . " Evening , may I join you a mo-ment ? " " Of course , Mr. Dunross . This is a pleasant surprise . May I offer you a drink ? " Tea , Chinese tea . Thanks . " Their table was away from others and when it was safe Dunross leaned forward . " Robert , I hear you 've arrested Brian Kwok , " he said still hoping it was n't true . The two men stared at him . " Who told you that ? " Armstrong asked . Dunross recounted his conversation . Both men listened noncommittally though from time to time he saw them glance at one another . " Obviously it 's a trade , " he told them . " Him for the cash . " Sinders sipped his hot chocolate . " How important 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sooner the better . " Dunross mopped his brow . " The cash will completely stop the bank runs , Mr. Sinders . We 've got t  --  " He stopped , aghast . " What is it ? " Sinders asked . " I  --  I suddenly remembered what AMG wrote in the intercepted report . That the ... police mole may or may not be part of Sevrin : Is he ? " " Who ? " " For chrissake , do n't play with me , " Dunross said angrily , " this 's seri/ous . You think I 'm a bloody fool ? There 's a Sevrin plant in Struan 's . If Brian 's part of Sevrin I 've a right to know . " " I quite agree , " Sinders said calmly though his eyes had become very flinty . " The moment the traitor 's uncovered you may rest assured you 'll be informed . Have you any idea who it could be yet ? " Dunross shook his head , controlling his anger . Sinders watched him . " You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , Mr. Dunross ? " " We 've got to get that cash at once . What 's Brian done ? " After a moment Sinders said , " Banks do n't open till Monday . So Monday'sD Day ? " " I imagine the banks will have to get the money before then  --  to open and have the money in the tills . What the devil 's Brian done ? " Sinders lit a cigarette for himself and for Armstrong . " If this person Brian actually has been arrested I do n't think that 's really a very discreet question , Mr. Dunross . " " I 'd 've bet anything , " the tai-pan said helplessly , " anything , but Tiptop'dnever suggest a trade unless it was true . Never . Brian must be bloody important but Christ , what 's the world coming to ? Will you handle the trade or will Mr. Crosse  --  I suppose the governor 's approval will be needed . " Thoughtfully the chief of MI-6 blew the tip of his cigarette . " I doubt if there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? The money 's more impor  --  " " That 's a matter of opinion , Mr. Dunross , if this Brian Kwok actually is under arrest . In any event , Her Majesty 's Government could hardly be subject to blackmail . Very poor taste . " " Quite . But Sir Geoffrey will agree at once . " " I doubt it . He impressed me as being much too clever to do that . As to trading , Mr. Dunross , I thought you were going to give us the AMG files . " Dunross felt an ice pick in his stomach . " I did , this evening . " " For chrissake , do n't play with me , this 's serious ! You think I 'm a bloody fool ? " Sinders said in exactly the same tone that Dunross had used . Abruptly he laughed dryly and continued with the same chilling calm , " You certainly gave us a version of them but unfortunately they just do n't compare in quality with the one intercepted . " The rumpled man 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change . " Mr. Dunross , your subterfuge was deft , commendable but unnecessary . We really do want those files , the originals . " " If those do n't satisfy you , why not go through AMG 's papers ? " " I did . " Sinders smiled without humor . " Well , it 's like the old highwaymansaying , The money or your life . ' Possession of those files may be lethal to you . You agree , Robert ? " " Yes sir . "  |p856Sinders  puffed his cigarette . " So , Mr. Dunross , Your Mr. Tiptop wants to trade , eh ? Everyone in Hong Kong wants to trade . It 's in the air . Eh ? But to trade you have to give value for value . I imagine if you want concessionsto get concessions from the enemy . . . well , all 's fair in love and war , they say . Is n't it ? " Dunross kept his face guileless . " So they say . I 'll talk to the governor first thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've talked to him . Night . " They watched him walk through the swing doors and disappear . " What do you think , Robert ? Did Dunross switch the files on us ? " Armstrong sighed . " I do n't know . His face said nothing . I was watchingclosely . Nothing . But he 's as sharp as a tack . " " Yes . " Sinders pondered a moment . " So the enemy want a trade , eh ? I 'd say we have possession of this particular client for twenty-four hours at the most . When do you do his next interrogation ? " " 6:30 A.M. " " Oh ! Well if you 've an early start we 'd better be going . " Sinders called for the check . " I 'll consult with Mr. Crosse but I know what he 'll say  --  what in fact London has ordered . " " Sir ? " " They 're very concerned because the client 's been party to too many secrets , the General Staff Course , the Royal Canadian Mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , Robert , now irrespective of what Mr. Dunross does our only course is to step up the debriefing . Yes . We 'll cancel the 6:3o interrogation , continue with the hourly schedule , providing he 's medically fit , and into the Red Room . " Armstrong blanched . " But si ... " " I 'm sorry , " Sinders said , his voice gentle . " I know he 's a friend , was a friend , but now your Mr. Tiptop and your Mr. Dunross have taken away our time . "  |p8599:32  A.M. : The JAL jet from Tokyo came in low over the sea and touched down perfectlyat Kai Tak with a puff of smoke from its wheels . At once its engines went into reverse thrust and it howled toward the airport complex , decelerating . Passengers , aircrew and visitors were milling in the busy terminal , Customsand Immigration and waiting areas . Outward-bound was easy . Incomingwas mostly easy . Except for Japanese nationals . Chinese have long memories . The years of the Japanese war occupation of China and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious to forget . Or to forgive . So Japanesenationals were checked more thoroughly . Even members of the JAL crew now going through , even the pert , pretty , polite air hostesses , some of whom were hardly alive when that occupation had ended , they too were given back their travel documents with a frigid stare . Next to them in line was an American . " ' Morning , " he said handing his passport to the official . " ' Morning . " The young Chinese flipped the book open and glanced at the photograph and at the man and leafed through to find the visa . Unnoticed , his foot touched a hidden switch . This alerted Crosse and Sinders who were in a nearby observation office . They went to the one-way mirror and looked at the man waiting at immigration in front of one of the six crowded lines of passengers . The passport , a year old , said , " Vincenzo Banastasio , male , born New York City , August 16 , 1910 . Hair gray , eyes brown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : England , Spain , Italy , Holland , Mexico , Venezuela , Japan . He stamped the dull gray book , handed it back noncommittally . Banastasio walked through to Customs , an expensive crocodile briefcase under his arm , carrying duty-free liquor in a gaudy plastic carrier , camera swinging off his shoulder . " Good-looking fellow , " Sinders said . " He takes care of himself . " Theyp860saw him disappear into the crowds . Crosse clicked on the portable CB . " Do you have him covered ? " he asked into it . " Yes sir , " came the instant answer . " I 'll keep monitoring this frequency . Keep me advised . " " Yes sir . " To Sinders , Crosse said , " We 'll have no problem tailing him . " " No . Glad I 've seen him . I always like to see an enemy in the flesh . " " Is he ? Enemy ? " " Mr. Rosemont thinks so . Do n't you ? " " I meant our enemy . I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure he 's tied into Intelligence . " Sinders sighed . " You 've checked the bugs ? " " Yes . " Late last night a team of SI experts had secretly put bugs into the bedroom Banastasio had booked at the Hilton . Also the office and privatesuite of Photographer Ng , Vee Cee Ng . They waited patiently . On the table the CB hissed and crackled slightly . After a pause Sinders said absently , " What about our other client ? " " Who ? Kwok ? " " Yes . How long do you think it 'll take ? " " Not long . " Crosse smiled to himself . " When do you put him into the Red Room ? " " I thought noon might be rather apt . Before if he 's ready . " " Armstrong 'll do the interrogation ? " " Yes . " " Armstrong 's a good man . He handled himself very well at the Ivanov . " " Next time would you mind keeping me advised ? After all , this is my area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision by London . " " What 's the idea ? About the Sunday summons . " The minister is sending special instructions . " Sinders frowned . " Brian Kwok 's records say he 's strong . We do n't have too much time . He'll 've been well indoctrinated to be hidden so deep , so long . " " Oh yes . But I 'm quite confident . Since I had the room built I 've experimentedon myself three times . The most I 've ever stayed was five minutes and each time I was sick as a dog  --  and that was without any disorientationscheduling . I 'm confident we 'll have no problem . " Crosse stubbed out his cigarette . " It 's very effective  --  an exact pattern of the KGB prototype . " After a moment Sinders said , " Pity these methods have to be used . Very dicey . Disgusting really . I preferred it when . . . well , even then , I supposeour profession was never really clean . " " You mean during the war ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there was no hypocrisy on the part of some of our leaders  --  or the media . Everyone understood we were at war . But today when our very survival 's threatened we  --  " Sindersp861stopped , then pointed . " Look , Roger , is n't that Rosemont ? " The American was standing with another man by the exit door . " Yes , yes it is . That 's Langan with him . The FBI man , " Crosse said . " Last night I agreed to a joint effort with him on Banastasio though I do wish those bloody CIA 'd leave us alone to do our job . " " Yes . They really are becoming quite difficult . " Crosse picked up the CB and led the way outside . " Stanley , we 've got him well covered . We agreed last night that on this operation we handle this part , you handle the hotel . Right ? " " Sure , sure , Rog . ' Morning , Mr. Sinders . " Grim-faced , Rosemont introducedLangan who was equally taut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bum is one of our nationals . That 's not the reason we 're here . I 'm just seeing Ed off . " " Oh ? " " Yes , " Langan said . He was as tired and gaunt as Rosemont . " It 's those photocopies , Rog . Thomas K. K. Um 's papers . I 've got to deliver them personally . To the Bureau . I read part to my chief and his pots blew and he began to come apart at the seams . " " I can imagine . " " There 's a request on your desk to let us have the originals and th  --  " " No chance , " Sinders said for Crosse . Langan shrugged . " There 's a request on your desk , Rog . Guess your brass 'll send orders from heaven if ours really need them . I 'd better get on board . Listen , Rog , we ca n't thank you enough . We  --  I owe you one . Those bastards . . . yeah we owe you one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarmac . " Which piece of information blew the seams , Mr. Rosemont ? " " They 're all lethal , Mr. Sinders . It 's a coup for us , for us and the Bureau , mostly the Bureau . Ed said his folk went into hysterics . The political implications for Democrats and Republicans are immense . You were right . If Senator Tillman  --  the presidential hopeful who 's in town right now  --  if he got hold of those papers , there 's no telling what he 'd do . " Rosemont was no longer his usual good-humored self . " My brass telexed our South American contacts to put an all-points on Thomas K. K. Lim so we 'll be interviewing him pretty damn soon  --  you 'll get a copy do n't worry . Rog , was there anything else ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " With these choice pieces , were there others we could use ? " Crosse smiled without humor . " Of course . How about a blueprint for financing a private revolution in Indonesia ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about photostats of arrangements for payments into a French bank account of a very important Vietnamese lady and gentleman  --  for specific favors granted ? " Rosemont had gone chalky . " What else ? "  |p862  " Is n't that enough ? " " Is there more ? " " For chrissake , Stanley , of course there 's more , you know it , we know it . There 'll always be more . " " Can we have them now ? " Sinders said , " What can you do for us ? " Rosemont stared at them . " Over lunch we 'll to  --  " The GB crackled into life . " The target 's got his bags now and he 's walking out of Customs , heading for the taxi rank . . . Now he 's .. . Now he 's . . . ah , someone 's meeting him , a Chinese , good-looking man , expensive clothes , do n't recognize him . . . . They 're going over to a Rolls , registration HK. . . . ah , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Into the sender Crosse said , " Stay on this frequency . " He switched frequencies . Static and muffled traffic and noise . Rosemont brightened . " You bugged the limo ? " Crosse nodded . " Great , Rog . I 'd 've missed that ! " They listened , then clearly , " . . . good of you to meet me , Vee Cee , " Banastasio was saying . " Hell you shouldn't 've come all this wa  --  " " Oh it 's my pleasure , " the cultured voice replied . ' We can chat in the car , perhaps that 'll save you coming to the office and then in Ma  --  " " Sure . . sure , " the American voice overrode the other man . " Listen , I got something for you , Vee Cee . . . " Muffled sounds then a sudden highpitchedwhine that totally dominated the airwave , completely obliterating the clarity and voices .

"  |p86310:52  A.M. : " Tai-pan , Dr. Samson calling from London . He 's on line three . " " Oh thank you , Claudia . " Dunross punched the button . " Hello , Doctor . You 're up late . " " I 've just come back from the hospital  --  sorry not to call before . You were calling about your sister , Mrs. Gavallan ? " " Yes . How is she ? " " Well , sir , we 've begun another stringent series of tests . Mentally , I must say she 's in very good shape . I 'm afraid physically not so good .... " Dunross listened with a sinking heart as the doctor went into detail about multiple sclerosis , how no one really knew much about it , that there was no known cure and that the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve structure had taken place it was not possible with present medications to climb back to the previous level . " I 've taken the liberty of calling in Professor Klienberg from the clinic at UCLA in Los Angeles for a consultation  --  he 's the world expert on the disease . Please rest assured we will do everything we can for Mrs. Gavallan . " " It does n't sound as if you can do anything at all . " " Well , it 's not quite as bad as that , sir . If Mrs. Gavallan takes care , rests , and is sensible , she can have a normal life for many years . " " How long is many years ? " Dunross heard the long hesitation . Oh Kathy , poor Kathy ! " I do n't know . Many times this sort of problem 's in the hands of God , Mr. Dunross . Patients do not follow the same time patterns . In Mrs. Gavallan 's case I could answer you better in six months , perhaps by Christmas . Meanwhile , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " No . She should be a private patient , Dr. Samson . Please send all bills to my office . " " Mr. Dunross , there 's no difference in the quality of service I give top864her . She just has to wait a little while in my waiting room and be in a ward , not a private room at the hospital . " " Please make her a private patient . I would prefer it , so would her hus-band . " Dunross heard the sigh and hated it . " Very well , " the doctor was saying . " I have all your numbers and I 'll call you the instant Professor Klienberghas made his examination and the tests are concluded . " Dunross thanked him and replaced the phone . Oh Kathy , poor dear Kathy . Earlier when he had got up at dawn he had talked to her and to Penelope . Kathy had said how much better she felt and how Samson was most encouraging . Penn had told him later that Kathy was looking very tired . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any chance you could come here for a week or two before October i o ? " " Not at the moment , Penn , but you never know . " " I 'm going to take Kathy to Avisyard as soon as she gets out of the hospital . Next week at the latest . She 'll be better there . The land will make her better , do n't worry , Ian . " " Penn , when you get to Avisyard , would you go out to the Shrieking Tree for me ? " " What 's the matter ? " He heard the concern in her voice . " Nothing , darling , " he told her , thinking about Jacques and Phillip Chen  --  how can I explain about them ? " Nothing particular , just more of the same . I just wanted you to say hello to our real Shrieking Tree . " " Our Jacaranda there 's no good ? " " Oh yes , she 's fine , but not the same . Perhaps you should bring a cuttingback to Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . Then you have to come home , do n't you , Ian ? " " Can I make a bet for you this afternoon ? " Again a pause . " Ten dollars on the horse you choose . I 'll back your choice . I 'll always back your choice . Call me tomorrow . Love you .. . ' bye . " He remembered the first time she had said , I love you , and then , later , when he had asked her to marry him , all the refusals and then eventually , through shattering tears , the real reason : " Oh Christ , Ian , I 'm not good enough for you . You 're upper class , I 'm not . The way I talk now , I acquired . It was because I was evacuated at the beginning of the war to the country  --  my God I 'd only been outside London twice in my whole life till then , just to the seaside . I was evacuated to a wonderful old manor house in Hampshire where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , Byculla was its name . There was a mix-up , Ian , my whole school went somewhere else , just me to Byculla , and it was only then that I found I talked different , differently  --  there , you see I still forgetp865sometimes ! Oh God , you 've no idea how awful it was to find out so young that . . . that I was common and talked common and that there are such limitless differences in England , the way we talk  --  the way we talk so im-portant ! " Oh how I worked to imitate the others . They helped me and there was one teacher who was so wonderful to me . I hurled myself into the new life , theirs , and I swore to better myself and never go back , never , never , never , and I wo n't . But I ca n't marry you , my darling  --  let 's just stay lovers  --  I 'll never be good enough . " But in time , her time , they had married . Granny Dunross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the Shrieking Tree , alone . She had never told him what she had said . I 'm lucky , Dunross thought . She 's the best wife a man could have . Since coming back from the track at dawn he had worked steadily . Half a hundred cables . Dozens of international phone calls . Countless locals . At 9:30 he had called the governor about Tiptop 's proposal . " I 'll have to consultthe minister , " Sir Geoffrey had said . " The earliest I could call him would be four this afternoon . This must be kept entirely secret , Ian . Dear oh dear , Brian Kwok must be very important to them ! " " Or perhaps just another convenient concession for the money . " " Ian , I do n't think the minister will agree to a trade . " " Why ? " " Her Majesty 's Government might consider it a precedent , a bad one . I would . " " The money 's vital . " " The money 's a temporary problem . Precedents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes sir . " " How 's the form ? " " They all looked in fine fettle . Alexi Travkin says Pilot Fish 's our main opposition and the going will be soft . Noble Star 's grand though she 's never raced in the wet . " " Will it rain ? " " Yes . But perhaps we 'll be lucky , sir . " " Let 's hope so . Terrible times , Ian . Still , these things are sent to try us , eh ? Are you going to John 's funeral ? " " Yes sir . " " So am I. Poor fellow . . . " At the funeral this morning Dunross had said kind words about John Chen for the face of the House of Chen and for all the Chen forebears who had served the Noble House so long and hard . " Thank you , tai-pan , " Phillip Chen had said simply . " Again , I 'm sorry . " Later he had said to Phillip Chen privately , " Sorry is sorry but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your son , and you , put us into . Or solve bloody Four Fingers and the third coin . "  |p866  " I know , I know ! " Phillip Chen had said , wringing his hands . " I know , and unless we can get the stock back up we 're ruined , we 're all ruined ! Oh ho , after you 'd announced the boom I bought and bought and now we 're ruined . " Dunross had said sharply , " We 've got the weekend , Phillip . Now listen to me , damnit ! You will claim every favor you 're owed . I want Lando Mata and Tightfist Tung 's backing by Sunday midnight . At least zo mil-lion . " " But , tai-pan , don  --  " " If I do n't get that by Sunday midnight , have your resignation on my desk by 9:00 A.M. , you 're no longer compradore , your son Kevin 's out and all your branch is out forever and I 'll choose a new compradore from anotherbranch . " Now he exhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably Jacques deVille  --  had betrayed their trust . He went to the coffee tray and poured himself some coffee . Today it did not taste good to him . The phones had been incessant , most of the calls about the looming collapseof the market , the banking system . Havergill , Johnjohn , Richard Kwang . Nothing from Tightfist or Lando Mata or Murtagh . The only bright spot had been his call to David MacStruan in Toronto : " David , I want you here for a conference on Monday . Can you g  --  " He had been swamped by the bellow of joy . " Tai-pan , I 'm on my way to the airport . Goo  --  " " Hang on , David ! " He had explained his plan about transferring Jacques to Canada . " Och , laddie , if you do that I 'm your slave forever ! " " I 'm going to need more than slaves , David , " he had said carefully . There was a long pause and the voice on the other end hardened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything . " Dunross smiled , warmed by the thought of his distant cousin . He let his eyes drift out of the windows . The harbor was misted , the sky low and dark but no rain yet . Good , he thought , so long as it does n't rain till after the fifth race . After four o'clock it can rain . I want to smash Gornt and Pilot Fish and oh God let First Central come up with my money , or Lando Mata or Tightfist or Par-Con ! Your bet 's covered , he told himself stoically , every way you can . And Casey ? Is she setting me up like Bartlett ? And like Gornt ? What about .. . The intercom clicked on . " Tai-pan , your eleven o'clock appointment 's here . " " Claudia , come in a second . " He took an envelope out of his drawer with the $i , 000 in it and gave it to her . " Betting money , as promised . " " Oh thank you , tai-pan . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smile . " You 're in Phillip 's box ? "  |p867  " Oh yes . Yes , Uncle Phillip invited me . He . . . he seems very upset , " she said . " It 's John . " Dunross was n't sure if she knew . She probably does , he thought , or soon will . There 're no secrets in Hong Kong . " What do you fancy ? " " Winner 's Delight in the first , Buccaneer in the second . " " Two outsiders ? " He stared at her . " You 've inside info ? " " Oh no , tai-pan . " A little of her normal good humor came back . " It 's just the form . " And in the fifth ? " " I 'm not betting the fifth , but all my hopes 're on Noble Star . " Claudia added worriedly , " Is there anything I can do to help , tai-pan ? Anything ? The stock market and . . . we have to slaughter Gornt somehow . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fang-pi . " The Canton obscenity was picturesque and she laughed . " Now show in Mrs. Gresserhoff . " " Yes , yes tai-pan , " Claudia said . " And thanks for the h'eung yau ! " In a moment , Dunross got up to greet his guest . She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen . " Ikaga desu lea ? " he asked in shock , his Japanese fluent  --  How are you ?  --  astounded that she could have been married to Alan Medford Grant whose name , God help us , was also supposed to be Hans Gresserhoff . " Genki , tai-pan . Doing . Genki desul Anatawa ? " Fine , tai-pan , thankyou . And you ? " Genki . " He bowed slightly in return and did not shake hands though he noticed her hands and feet were tiny and her legs long . They chatted for a moment then she switched to English with a smile . " Your Japanese is oh very good , tai-pan . My husband , he did not tell me you were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thank you ... but oh please let me get it for you too . " Before he could stop her she had gone to the coffee tray . He watched her pour delicately . She offered him the first cup with a little bow . " Please . " Riko Gresserhoff  --  RikoAnjin  --  was barely five feet , perfectly proportioned with short hair and lovely smile and she weighed about ninety pounds . Her blouse and skirt were auburn silk , well cut and French . " Thank you for the expense money Miss Claudia gave me . " " It 's nothing . We owe your , your husband 's estate about 8,000 pounds . I 'll have a cashier 's check for you tomorrow . " " Thank you . " " You have me at a disadvantage , Mrs. Gresserhoff . You kn  --  " " Please call me Riko , tai-pan . " " Very well , Riko-san . You know me but I know nothing about you . " " Yes . My husband said I was to tell you whatever you wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had made sure you were the tai-pan , then I was to give you an envelope I have brought from him to you . May I bring it later ? " Again the little interrogative smile . " Please ? "  |p868  " I 'll come back with you now and collect it . " " Oh no , that would be too much trouble . Perhaps I can bring it to you after luncheon . Please . " " How big is it ? The envelope ? " Her tiny hands measured the air . " It is an ordinary envelope but not so thick . You could put it easily into your pocket . " Again the smile . " Perhaps you 'd like to . . . I tell you what , " he said , charmed by her presence . " In a minute or two I 'll send you back by car . You can fetch the envelope and come right back . " Then he added , knowing it would ruin the seating arrangements but not caring , " Would you join us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . but I would have to change and . . . oh thank you but no , it would be too much trouble for you . Perhaps I could deliver the letterlater , or tomorrow ? My husband said I was only to put it into your hands . " " No need to change , Riko-san . You look lovely . Oh ! Do you have a hat ? " Perplexed she stared at him . " Please ? " " Yes , it 's , er , yes , it 's our custom that ladies wear hats and gloves to the races . Silly custom but do you ? Have a hat ? " " Oh yes . Every lady has a hat . Of course , " A wave of relief went through him . " Good , then that 's settled . " " Oh ! Then if you say so . " She got up . " Shall I go now ? " " No , if you 've time , please sit down . How long were you married ? " " Four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said firmly , " Hans told me to tell you , but you alone , if ever he was to die and I was to come as I have come , to tell you that our marriage was of convenience . " " What ? " She reddened a little as she continued . " Please excuse me but I was to tell you . It was a convenience to both of us . I obtained a Swiss citizenship and passport and he obtained someone to care for him when he came to Switzerland . I . . . I did not wish to marry but he asked me many times and he . . . and he stressed that it would protect me when he died . " Dunross was startled . " He knew he was going to die ? " " I think so . He said the marriage contract was for five years only but that we should have no children . He took me to an advocate in Zurich who drew up a contract for five years . " She opened her purse , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an envelope . " Hans told me to give you these . They 're copies of the contract , my , my birth and marriagecertificate , his will and birth certificate . " She took out a tissue and pressed it against her nose . " Please excuse me . " Carefully she untied the string around the envelope and took out a letter . Dunross accepted it . He recognized AMG 's handwriting . " Tai-pan : This will confirm my wife , Riko Gresserhoff  --  Riko Anjin  --  is who she says she is . I love her with all my heart . She merits and merited far better thanp869me . If she needs help . . . please please please . " It was signed Hans Gresserhoff . " I do not merit better , tai-pan , " she said with a sad , small confident voice . " My husband was good to me , very good . And I 'm sorry he is dead . " Dunross watched her . " Was he ill ? Did he know he was going to die from an illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me . One of his asks before I . . . before I married him was that I would not question him or question where he went , why , or when he was to return . I was just to accept him as he was . " A small shiver went through her . " It was very hard living thus . " " Why did you agree to live like that ? Why ? Surely it was n't neces-sary ? " Again Riko hesitated . " I was born in Japan in 1939 and went as an infantwith my parents to Berne  --  my father was a minor official in the JapaneseEmbassy there . In 1943 he went back to Japan but left us in Geneva . Our family is  --  our family comes from Nagasaki . In 1945 my father was lost and all our family was lost . There was nothing to go back to and my mother wanted to stay in Switzerland , so we went to live in Zurich with a good man who died four years ago . He . . . they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy family . For many years I knew they were not married though they pretended and I pretended . When he died there was no money , or just a little money . Hans Gresserhoff was an acquaintanceof this man , my , my stepfather . His name was Simeon Tzerak . He was a displaced person , tai-pan , a stateless person from Hungary who had taken up residence in Switzerland . Before the war he was an accountant , he said , in Budapest . My mother arranged my marriage to Hans Gresserhoff . " Now she looked up from the carpet at him . " It was ... it was a good marriage , tai-pan , at least I tried very hard to be whatever my husbandwanted and my mother wanted . My giri , my duty was to obey my mother , neh ? " " Yes , " he said kindly , understanding duty and giri , that most Japanese of words , most important of words that sums up a heritage and a way of life . " You have performed your giri perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your giri now ? " " My mother is dead , tai-pan . When my stepfather died she did not wish to live . The moment I was married she went up the mountain and skied into a crevasse . " " Terrible . " " Oh no , tai-pan , very good . She died as she wished to die , at a time and place of her choosing . Her man was dead , I was safe , what more was there for her to do ? " " Nothing , " he told her , hearing the softness of her voice , the sincerity , and the calm . The Japanese word wa came to his mind : harmony . That 's what this girl has , he thought . Harmony . Perhaps that 's what 's so beautifulabout her . Ayeeyah that I could acquire such walp870One of his phones sounded . " Yes , Claudia ? " " It 's Alexi Travkin , tai-pan . Sorry , he said it was important . " " Thank you . " To the girl he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sorry to interrupt , tai-pan , but Johnny Moore 's sick and he wo n't be able to ride . " Johnny Moore was their chief jockey . Dunross 's voice sharpened . " He seemed all right this morning . " " He 's running i o3-degree temperature , the doctor said it might be food poisoning . " " You mean he 's been tampered with , Alexi ? " " I do n't know , tai-pan . I only know he 's no good for us today . " Dunross hesitated . He knew he was better than the rest of his jockeys though the extra weight Noble Star would have to carry would load the deck against the horse . Should I or should n't I ? " Alexi , schedule Tom Wong . We 'll decide before the race . " " Yes . Thank you . " Dunross replaced the phone . " Anjin 's a curious name , " he said . " It means pilot , just pilot , or navigator , does n't it ? " " The legend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmanwho became a samurai and advisor to the Shogun Yoshi Toranaga , oh very many years ago , long long ago . We have many stories but they say first he had a fief in Hemi , near Yokohama , then went with his family to Nagasaki as inspector general of all foreigners . " Again the smile and the shrug and the tip of her tongue moistened her lips . " It is just legend , taipan . He is supposed to have married a highborn lady called Riko . " Her chuckle filled the room . " You know Japanese ! A gai-jin , a foreigner , marryinga highborn lady  --  how could that be possible ? But anyway , it is a pleasingstory and an explanation of a name , neh ? " She got up and he got up . " I should go now . Yes ? " No , he wanted to say . The black Daimler pulled up outside the V and A , the Struan arms discreetly on the doors . Casey and Bartlett waited at the top of the stairs , Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillbox hat and white gloves , Bartlett broad-shouldered , wearing a blue tie to match his well-cut suit . Both were set-faced . The chauffeur approached them . " Mr. Bartlett ? " " Yes . " They came down the steps to meet him . " You our limo ? " " Yes sir . Excuse me sir , but do you both have your badge tickets , and the invitation card ? " " Yes , here they are , " Casey said . " All , good . Sorry but without them . . . My name 's Lim . The , er , the custom is for the gentlemen to tie both badges through the hole in their lapels and the ladies usually have a pin . " " Whatever you say , " Bartlett said . Casey got in the back and he fol/lowed . They sat far apart . Silently they began to fix the small , individuallynumbered badges . Blandly Lim closed the door , noticing the frigidity , and chortled inwardly . He closed the electric glass partition window and switched on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , sir , just use the microphone above you . " Through his rear mirror he saw Bartlett use the switch momentarily . " Sure , thank you , Lim . " Once Lim was in the traffic he reached under the dash and touched a hidden switch . At once Bartlett 's voice came through the speaker . .. going to rain ? " " I do n't know , Linc . The radio said it would but everyone 's praying . " A hesitation , then coldly , " I still think you 're wrong . " Lim settled back happily . His trusted older brother Lim Chu , majordomoto the tai-pans of the Noble House , had arranged for another younger brother , an expert radio mechanic , to install this bypass switch so that he could overhear his passengers . It had been done at great cost to protect the tai-pan and older brother Lim had ordered it was never to be used when the tai-pan was in the car . Never never never . It never had been . Yet . Lim felt queasy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  of course to protect  --  overcame their anxiety . Oh oh oh , he chortled , Golden Pubics is certainly in a rage ! Casey was seething . " Let 's quit this , Linc , huh ? " she said . " Since our breakfast meeting you 've been like a bear with a sore ass ! " " And what about you ? " Bartlett glared at her . " We 're going with Gornt  --  the way I want it . " " This 's my deal , you 've said that fifty times , you promised , you 've alwayslistened before . Jesus , we 're on the same side . I 'm only trying to protectyou . I know you 're wrong . " " You think I 'm wrong . And it 's all because of Orlanda ! " " That 's a crock ! I went through my reasons fifty times . If Ian gets out of the trap then we 're better off to go with him than Gornt . " Bartlett 's face was cold . " We 've never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote your shares , I 'll vote mine and your ass 'll be in a vise before you can count to ten ! " Casey 's heart was thumping . Ever since their breakfast meeting with Seymour Steigler , the day had been heavy going . Bartlett was adamant that their best course lay with Gornt and nothing she could say would dissuadehim . After an hour of trying she had closed the meeting and gone off to deal with a pile of overnight telexes , then , remembering suddenly at the last moment , had rushed out in a panic and bought her hat . When she had met Bartlett in the foyer with great trepidation , wanting the hat to please him , she had begun to make peace but he had interruptedher . " Forget it , " he had said . " So we disagree . So what ? "  |p872She  had waited and waited but he had n't even noticed . " What do you think ? " " I told you . Gornt 's best for us . " " I meant my hat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what 's different ! Hey , it 's okay . " She had felt like tearing it off and hurling it at him . " It 's Parisian , " she had said half-heartedly . " It says hats and gloves on the invitation , remember ? It 's a crock but Ian said that la  --  " " What makes you think he can get out of the trap ? " " He 's clever . And the tai-pan . " " Gornt 's got him on the run . " " It looks that way . So let 's forget it for now . Maybe we 'd better wait outside . The car 's coming at noon promptly . " " Just a minute , Casey . What have you got cooking ? " " What do you mean ? " " I know you better than anyone . What do you have on the burner ? " Casey hesitated , unsure of herself , wondering if she should reveal the First Central ploy . But there 's no reason to , she reassured herself . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first to know . Ian promised . Then Linc can cover his 2 million with Gornt and they can buy back in to cover their selling short and make a huge profit . At the same time Ian , Linc and I get in at the bottom of the market and make our own killing . I 'll be the first to know after Murtagh and Ian . Ian promised . Yes , yes he did . But can I trust him ? A wave of nausea went through her . Can you trust anyone in business here , or anywhere ? Man or woman ? At dinner last night she had trusted him . Influenced by the wine and food she had told him about her relationship with Linc , and about the bargain they had made . " That 's a bit rough , is n't it ? On both of you ? " " Yes , yes and no . We were both over twenty-one , Ian , and I wanted so much more than being just Mrs. Line Bartlett , a **55;8176;TOOLONG a left-at-home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're always left . At home . So home becomes a prison in the end , and it drives you mad , being trapped until death do us part ! I 've seen it too many times . " " Someone has to look after the home and the children . It 's the man 's job to make the money . It 's the wife 's j  --  " " Yes . Most times . But not for me . I 'm not prepared to accept that and I do n't think it 's wrong to want a different sort of life . I 'm the wage earner for my family . My sister 's husband died so there 's my sister and her kids , and my Ma and uncle are getting on . I 'm educated and good and better than most in business . The world 's changing , everything 's changing , Ian . " " I said before , not here thank God ! "  |p873Casey  remembered how she had readied to return measure for measure , but had bitten back the old Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hag ? How did she do it ? What was her secret ? How did she become more equal than anyone ? " " She kept her hands on the purse strings . Absolutely . Oh she conceded outward position and face to Culum and following tai-pans but she kept the books , she hired and fired through him  --  she was the strength of that family . When Culum was dying , it was easy to persuade him to make her tai-pan . He gave her the Struan chop , family chop and all the reins and all the secrets . But , wisely , she kept it all very secret and after Culum she only appointed those she could control , and never once gave any one of them the purse strings , or real power , not until she herself was dying . " " But ruling through others , is that enough ? " " Power is power and I do n't think it matters so long as you rule . For a woman  --  after a certain age  --  power only comes with control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hong Kong 's the only place on earth you can get it to keep it .

I think it 's been good for I , inc  --  oh how I hope so . He 's our tai-pan and I 'm not trying to become one . I just want to succeed as a woman . He 's helped me tremendously , of course he has . Without him I 'd never have . made it . So we 're in business together , until my birthday . November 25 this year . That 's D Day . That 's when we both decide . " " And ? " " 1 do n't know . I honestly do n't know . Oh I love Linc , more than ever , but we 're not lovers . " Later , coming back on the ferry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had decided not to . " Perhaps I should have , " she muttered out loud . " Eh ? " " Oh ! " She came out of her reverie , finding herself in the limo on the car ferry en route to Hong Kong . " Sorry , Linc , I was daydreaming . " She looked at him and saw that he was as handsome as ever , even though now he stared back coldly . You 're more attractive to me than eitherpan or Quillan , she thought . And yet , right now , I 'd prefer to pillow with either of them than with you . Because you 're a bastard . " Do you want to have at it ? " he said . " You want to vote your shares against mine ? " Casey stared back at him , enraged . Tell him to go screw , the devil half of her screamed , he needs you more than you need him , you 've got the reins of Par-Con , you know where the bodies are buried , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other half of her urged caution.  |p874She  remembered what the tai-pan had said about this man 's world , and about power . And about the Hag . So she dropped her gaze a moment and allowed tears to seep . At once she saw the change in him . " Jesus , Casey , do n't cry , I 'm sorry ... " he was saying and his arms reached out for her . " Jesus , you 've never cried before . . . Listen , we 've been through the mill a dozen times , hell , fifty times , there 's no need to get so uptight . We 've got Struan 's and Gornt locked into battle . There 's no difference in the end . We 'll still be the Noble House , but up front , up front Cornt 's better , I know I 'm right . " Oh no , you 're not , she thought contentedly , warm in his embrace.  |p87512:32  P.M. : Brian Kwok was screaming and beyond terror . He knew he was in prison and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane world was an instantof never-ending blinding light , everything blood-colored , the cell walls floor ceiling blood-colored , no doors or windows , and the floor awash with blood , but everything twisted and all upside down for somehow he was lying on the ceiling , his whole being in torment , frantically trying to claw his way down to normality , each time falling back into the mess of his own vomit , then the next instant once more in the blackness , grinding pulsating voices laughing , drowning out his friend , drowning out Robert who pleaded with the devils to stop stop for the love of God stop , then once more the eye-tearing head-exploding bloodlight , seeing the blood waters that would not fall , groping desperately , stretching down for the chairs and table that sat in the blood water but falling back , always falling hack , floor meeting ceiling everything wrong upside sideways madness madness the devil 's invention . . Bloodlight and darkness and laughter and stench and blood again , on and on and on . . He knew he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begging them to let him go , swearing he would do anything but let him go , that he was not the one they sought , not due for hell . . . It 's a mistake , it 's all a mistake , no it 's not a mistake I was the enemy who was the enemy what enemy ? Oh please let the world turn right side up and let me lie where I should be lying up there , down there , where oh Jesus Christ Robert Christ help , help meeeeee . . . " All right , Brian . I 'm here . I 'm putting everything right . I am . I 'm puttingeverything right ! " He heard the compassionate words come soaring out of the maelstrom , drowning the laughter . The enveloping blood went away . He felt his friend 's hand , cool and gentle , and he clutched it , terrified lest it was another dream within a dream within a dream , oh Christ Robert do n't leave me ... .  |p876Oh  Jesus it 's impossible ! Look there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm here , I 'm lying on the bed where I should be and the room 's dim but soft where it should be , everything 's clean , flowers , blinds drawn but flowers and the water properly in the vase and I 'm right side up , I 'm right side up . " Oh Christ , Robert ... " " Hello , chum , " Robert Armstrong said gently . " Oh Jesus Robert thank you thank you , I 'm right side up oh thank you thank you . . . " It was hard to talk and he felt weak , his strength gone , but it was gloriousjust to be here , out of the nightmare , his friend 's face misted but real . And smoking , am I smoking ? Oh yes . Yes I think I remember Robert left me a packet of cigarettes though those devils came and found them and took them away last week . . . thank God for smoke . . . When was it , last month , last week , when ? I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret drag last month , was it last month ? " Oh that tastes so good , so good and the peace , no nightmare , Robert , not seeing blood up there , the ceiling awash , not lying up there but down here not in hell oh thank you thank you ... " " I must go now . " " Oh Christ do n't go they may come back no do n't go sit and stay please stay . Look , we 'll talk , yes , that 's it , talk , you wanted to talk . . . do n't leave . Please talk ... " " All right , old friend , then talk . I wo n't go while we talk . ' What do you want to tell me , eh ? Certainly I 'll stay while you talk . Tell me about Ning-tok and your father . Did n't you go back to see him ? " " Oh yes , I went back to see him once , yes , just before he died , my friends helped me , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me . . . that , that was so long ago .... " " Did Ian go with you ? " " Ian ? No it . . . was it Ian ? I ca n't remember . . . Ian , the tai-pan ? Someone went with me . Was it you , Robert ? Ah , with me in Ning-tok ? No it was n't you or Ian it was John Chancellor from Ottawa . He hates the Soviets too , Robert , they 're the great enemy . Even in school , and devil Chiang Kai-shek and his assassins Fong-fong and . . . and . . . Oh I 'm sotired and so pleased to see you .... " " Tell me about Fong-fong . " " Oh him . He was a bad man , Robert , him and all his spy group they were against us , the PRC , and pro-Chiang , I know ; do n't worry as soon as I read the . . . What are you asking me , eh ? What ? " " It was that rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and I almost fainted when he knew I was . . . I .. . where was I oh yes but I stopped Fong-fong at once . . . . Oh yes . " " Who did you tell ? " " Tsu-yan . I whispered it to Tsu-yan . He 's back in Peking now . . . Oh he was very high up , though he did n't know who I really was , Robert , Ip877was all very hush-hush .... Yes then it was in school , my father sent me after old Sh'in was murdered . . . thugs came and flogged him to death in the village square because he was one of us , one of the people , one of Chairman Mao 's people , and when I was in Hong Kong I stayed with ... with Uncle ... I went to school . . . and he schooled me at night . . . . Can I sleep now ? " " Who was your uncle , Kar-shun , and where did he live ? " " I do n't . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I must go . Next week I 'll come ba  --  " " No wait , Robert , wait , it was Wu Tsa-fing , on . . . on Fourth Alley in Aberdeen . . . number 8 , lucky 8 , fifth floor . There , I can remember ! Do n't go ! " " Very good , old chum . Very good . Were you at school long in Hong Kong ? " Robert Armstrong kept his voice soft and kind and his heart went out to his friend that once was . He was astonished that Brian had broken so easily , so quickly . The client 's mind was open now , ready for him to take apart . He kept his eyes on the shell of the man who lay on the bed , encouraging him to remember so that the others who listened secretly could record all the facts and figures and names and places , the undercover truths and half-truths that were spilling out and would continue to spill out until Brian KarshunKwok was a husk . And he knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or become impatient or angry or pretend to want to leave or curse the jailer away who would interrupt , if necessary . With Crosse and Sinders monitoring the in-depth debriefing , he was just a tool like Brian Kwok had been a tool for others who had used his mind and talents for their own purposes . His job was just to be the medium , to keep the client talking , to bring him back when he rambled or became incoherent , to be his sole friend and his sole prop in this unreal universe , the one who brought the truth forth  --  like John Chancellor of Ottawa , who 's he ? Where does he fit ? I do n't know yet . We 'll get everything the client has now , he thought . We 'll get all his contacts , his mentors , enemies and friends . Poor old Fong-fong and the lads . We 'll never see them again  --  unless they turn up as agents of the other side . What a rotten filthy business this is , selling out your friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enslaved. ... in Vancouver it was wonderful , wonderful , Robert . There was a girl there who . . . Yes and I almost married her but Sensible Tok , Sensiblewas my 489 , he lived . . . he lived on . . . oh yes it was Pedder Street in Chinatown and he owned the Hoho-tok Restaurant . . . yes Sensible Tok said I should honor Chairman Mao before any quai loh .... Oh how I loved her but he said it was the quai lohs who raped China for centuries .... You know that 's true that 's true . . . " " Yes that 's true , " he said , humoring him . " Sensible Tok was your only friend in Canada ? "  |p878  " Oh no Robert I have dozens . . . . " Armstrong listened , astounded by the wealth of information about the inner workings of the Canadian Mounted Police , and the extent of ChineseCommunist infiltration throughout the Americas and Europe and particularly on the Western seaboard  --  Vancouver , Seattle , San Francisco , Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop or businessexisted there was the potential of pressure , of funds and most of all of knowledge . " . . and the Wo Tuk on Gerrard Street in London 's the Center where I . . . when I was . . . Oh my head aches I 'm so thirsty .... " Armstrong gave him the water that contained stimulant . When he or Crosse considered the moment correct , the client would be given the thirst-quenching , delicately flavored Chinese tea that was his favorite . This contained the soporific . Then it was up to Crosse and Sinders what happened , whether it was more of the same , more of the Red Room or the end of the exercise and then , carefully , the gradual bringing back of the client to reality , with great care , so that no permanent damage was done . It 's up to them , he thought . Sinders was right to put on the pressure while we 've time . The client knows too much . He 's too well trained , and if we 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that would have been irresponsible . We 've got to keep ahead . Armstrong lit two cigarettes and inhaled his own deeply . I 'll give up smoking for Christmas . I ca n't now , not with all this horror . It was Brian Kwok 's wailing screams so soon , barely twenty minutes after being put into the room for the second time that had shattered him . He had been watching through spyholes with Crosse and Sinders , watching the insanityof trying to reach the ceiling that was the floor that was the ceiling , astonishedthat someone so strong , so well trained as Brian Kwok would break so quickly . " It 's impossible , " he had muttered . " He may be faking , " Sinders said . " No , " Crosse had said . " No . It 's real , for him . I know . " " I do n't believe he 'd break so easily . " " You will , Robert . " And then when Brian Kwok had been carried out to be brought to this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mopped dean , Roger Crosse had said , " All right , Robert , try it , then you 'll see . " " No , no thanks . It 's like something out of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari , " he had muttered . " No thanks ! " " Please try it , just for a minute . It 's an important experience for you . You may be caught by them , the other side , some day . You should be prepared . One minute might save your sanity . Test it , for your own safety . " So he had agreed . They had closed the door . The room was totally scarlet , small but everything tilted , the lines all wrong , angles all wrong , thep879floor meeting the ceiling in one corner , perspectives all wrong , no angles ordinary . The tilted ceiling far above was a sheer sheet of scarlet glass . Above the glass , water washed down to be recycled and come down again . Attached to this tilted glass ceiling surface were scarlet chairs and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarlet cushions on the chairs , making it seem the floor , a false door nearby , almost ajar .. . Sudden blackness . Then the blinding strobe and the stunning impact of the scarlet . Blackness , scarlet , blackness , scarlet . Involuntarily he groped for the reality of the table and chairs and the floor and door and stumbled and fell , unable to get his bearings , water above , the glass vanished , just insane scarlet water on the floor above . Blackness and now voices poundingand again blood-colored hell . His stomach told him that he was upside down though his mind said it was just a trick and to close your eyes it 's a trick it 's a trick it 's a trick .. . After an eternity , when at length normal lights came on and the real door opened , he was lying on the real floor , retching . " You bastard , " he had snarled at Crosse , barely able to talk . " You said a minute , you lying bastard ! " His chest heaved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand or to stop vomiting . " Sorry , but it was only a minute , Robert , " Crosse said . " I do n't believe it . . . " " Honestly , it was , " Sinders said . " I timed it myself . Really ! Extraordinary . Most effective . " Again Armstrong felt his chest heave at the thought of the water above and the table and chairs . He put those thoughts away and concentrated on Brian Kwok , feeling that he had let the client ramble enough , and it was now time to bring him back . " You were saying ? You passed over our dossiers to your friend Bucktooth Lo ? " " Well no , it was n't . . . I 'm tired , Robert , tired . . . what ar  --  " " If you 're tired I 'll leave ! " He got up and saw the client blanch . " Next month I 'll se  --  " " No . . . no . . . please do n't go . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleassssssse ! " So he sat back , continuing the game , knowing it to be unfair , and that with the client so totally disoriented he could be made to sign anything , say anything at whim . " I 'll stay while you talk , old friend . You were sayingabout Bucktooth Lo  --  the man in Princes Building ? He was the go-be-tween ? " " No . . . not . . . yes in a way . . . Dr. Meng . . . Dr. Meng would pick up any package that I left . . . Meng never knew that I ... that it was me ... the arrangements were by phone or by letter . . . he would take them to Lo who was paid . . . Bucktooth Lo was paid to give them to another man , I do n't know who . . . I do n't know ... " " Oh I think you do , Brian , I do n't believe you want me to stay . " " Oh Christ I do . . . I swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . or perhaps Ng , Vee Cee Ng , Photographer Ng , he 's on our side , he 's on our side Robert . . . Ask him , he 'll know . . . he was with Tsu-yan importing thoriums ... " " What 're thoriums ? " " Rare earths for . . . for atomics , for our atomics . . . oh yes we 'll have our own A-bombs and H-bombs in a few months . . . . " Brian Kwok went into a paroxysm of laughter . " The first in a few weeks . . . our first explosionin just a few weeks now oh of course not perfect but the first and soon an H-bomb , dozens , Robert , soon we 'll have ours to defend against those hegemonists who threaten to wipe us out , in a few weeks ! Christ , Robert , think of that ! Chairman Mao 's done it , he has , he 's done it .. . yes and then next year H-bombs and then Joe , yes we 'll get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out theirs . . . we will , Joe 's going to help , Joe Yu 's going to . . . Oh we 'll stop them now , stop them we 'll stop them and take our lands back . " His hand reached out and he held Robert Armstrong 's arm but his grip was weak . " Listen , we 're at war already , us and the Soviets , Chung Li told me , he 's my emergency . . . em , em contact . . . there 's a war , a shooting war going on right now . In the north , divisions , not patrols near the Amur they 're they 're killing more Chinese and stealing more land but . . . but not for long . " He lay back weakly and began to mumble , his mind wandering . " Atomics ? Next year ? I do n't believe it , " Armstrong said , pretending to scoff , his mind blown as he listened to the continued outpouring that was giving chapter and verse and names . Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world 's been told that 's ten years away . China with AandH-bombs ? Carefully he let Brian Kwok peter out and then he said casually , " Who 's Joe ? Joe Yu ? " " Who ? " He saw Brian Kwok turn and stare at him , eyes strange , different , boringinto him . Instantly he was on guard and he prepared . " Joe Yu , " he said even more offhand . " Who ? I do n't know any Joe Yu . . . no . . . . What , what . . . what am I doing here ? What is this place ? What 's happening ? Yu ? Why .. . why should I know him ? Who ? " " No reason , " Armstrong said , calming him . " Here , here 's some tea , you must be very thirsty , old chum . " " Oh yes . . . yes I am . . . where . . . yes . . . Christ what 's happ .. . happening ? " Armstrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and further calmed him . In a few moments Brian Kwok was again deeply asleep . Armstrong wiped his palms and his forehead , exhausted too . The door opened . Sinders and Crosse came in . " Very good , Robert , " Sinders said excitedly , " very good indeed ! "  |p881  " Yes , " Crosse said . " I felt he was coming back too . Your timing was per-fect . " Armstrong said nothing , feeling soiled . " My God , " Sinders chortled , " this client 's gold . The minister will bedelighted . Atomics in a few months and a shooting war going on right now ! No wonder our Parliamentary Trade Commission made such marvelousprogress ! Excellent , Robert , just excellent ! " " You believe the client , sir ? " Crosse said . " Absolutely , do n't you ? " " I believe he was telling what he knew . Whether it 's fact , that 's another matter . Joe Yu ? Does Joe or Joseph Yu mean anything to you ? " The others shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Chung Li ? " Armstrong said , " There 's a Chung Li who 's a friend of Br  --  the client 's , a car enthusiast  --  Shanghainese , big industrialist  --  could be him . " " Good . But Joe Yu , that triggered something in him . Could be important . " Crosse glanced at Sinders . " Proceed ? " " Of course . "  |p8821:45  p.M. : A roar of excitement went up from fifty thousand throats as the seven entriesfor the first race , jockeys up , came up the ramp out from under the stands to prance and skitter to the owners ' paddock where trainers and owners waited . The owners and their wives were dressed in their very best , many of the wives laden and over-minked , Mai-ling Kwang and Dianne Chen among them , conscious of the envious stares of the multitudecraning to see the horses  --  and them . Either side of the soggy grass paddock and winner 's circle , the packed mass of the crowds went down to the white sparkling rails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post was opposite and beside it , on the other side of the track , was the huge totalizator that would carry the names of the horses and jockeys and odds , race by race . The totalizator was owned and operated by the Turf Club , as was the course . There were no legal bookmakers here or outside or any legal offcoursebetting places . This was the only legal form of betting in the Colony . The sky was dark and forbidding . Earlier there had been a few sprinklesbut now the air was clear . Behind the paddock and winner 's circle , on this level , were the jockeys ' changing rooms and the offices of the officials  --  food concessions and the first banks of betting windows . Above them were the stands , four terraced tiers , each cantilevered floor with its own bank of betting windows . The first tier was for nonvoting members , next for voting members , and the two top floors set aside for the private boxes and radio room . Each box had its own private kitchen . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there were some permanent ones : first his Excellency the governor , patron of the club ; then the commander-in-chief ; one each for Blacs and the Victoria . And last , Struan 's . Struan 's was in the best position , exactly opposite the winning post . " Why 's that , tai-pan ? " Casey asked  |p883  " Because Dirk Struan began the Turf Club , set the rules , brought out a famous racing expert , Sir Roger Blore , to be the first secretary of the club . He put up all the money for the first meeting , money for the stands , money to import the first batch of horses from India and helped persuade the first plenipotentiary , Sir William Longstaff , to deed the land to the Turf Club in perpetuity . " " Come now , tai-pan , " Donald McBride , the track steward for this meeting , said jovially , " tell it as it happened , eh ? You say Dirk helped persuade ' ? Did n't Dirk just order ' Longstaff to do it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had hosted , Casey , Hiro Toda and McBride , who had just arrived to visit . There was a bar and three round tables in the box , each seating twelve comfortably . " I prefer my version , " he said . " In any event , Casey , the legend is that Dirk was voted this position by popular acclaim when the first stands were built . " " That 's not true either , Casey , " Willie Tusk called out from the next table . " Did n't old Tyler Brock demand the position as the right of Brock and Sons ? Did n't he challenge Dirk to put up the position on a race , man to man , at the first meeting ? " " No , that 's just a story . " " Did those two race , tai-pan ? " Casey asked . " They were going to . But the typhoon came too soon , so they say . In any event Culum refused to budge so here we are . This 's ours while the course exists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his happy smile . " The Noble House deserves the best . Since the very first stewards were elected , Miss Casey , the tai-pan of Struan 's has always been a steward . Always . By popularacclaim . Well , I must be off . " He glanced at his watch , smiled at Dunross . With great formality he said , " Permission to start the first race , tai-pan ? " Dunross grinned back at him . " Permission granted . " McBride hurried off . Casey stared at Dunross . " They have to ask your permission to begin ? " " It 's just a custom . " Dunross shrugged . " I suppose it 's a good idea for someone to say , All right , let 's begin , ' is n't it ? I 'm afraid that unlike Sir Geoffrey , the governors of Hong Kong in the past have n't been known for their punctuality . Besides , tradition is not a bad thing at all  --  gives you a sense of continuity , of belonging  --  and protection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse me a moment , I must do a few things . " " Have fun ! " She watched him go , liking him even more than last night . Just then Peter Marlowe came in and Dunross stopped a moment . " Oh hello , Peter , good to see you . How 's Fleur ? " " Getting better , thank you , tai-pan . " " Come on in ! Help yourself to a drink  --  I ' 11 be back in a moment . Put your money on number five , Excellent Day , in the first ! See you later . "  |p884  " Thanks , tai-pan . " Casey beckoned to Peter Marlowe but he did not see her . His eyes had fixed on Grey who was with Julian Broadhurst out on the balcony , ha-I ranguing some of the others . She saw his face close and her heart leaped , remembering their hostility , so she called out , " Peter ! Hi , come and sit down . " His eyes unglazed . " Oh ! Oh hello , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be fine . " " She certainly appreciated your going to see her . " It was a pleasure . Are the kids okay ? " " Oh yes . You ? " " Fantastic . This is the only way to go to a race ! " Lunch in the Struan box for the thirty-six guests had been a lavish buffet of hot Chinese foods or , if they preferred , hot steak-and-kidney pie and vegetables , with plates of smoked salmon , hors d'oeuvres and cold cuts , cheeses and pastries of all kinds and as a topper , a meringue sculpture of the Struan Building  --  all prepared in their own kitchen . Champagne , with the best red and white wines , liqueurs . " I 'm gon na have to diet for fifty years . " " Not you . How goes it ? " She felt his probing eyes . " Fine . Why ? " " Nothing . " He glanced off at Grey again , then turned his attention to the others . " May I introduce Peter Marlowe ? Hiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist-screenwriter from Hollywood . " Then all at once his book rushed into her mind and Changi and three and a half years as a prisoner of war and she waited for the explosion . There was a hesitation between both men . Toda politely offered his business card and Peter Marlowe gave his in return , equally politely . He hesitated a momentthen put out his hand . " How 're you ? " The Japanese shook it . " This 's an honor , Mr. Marlowe . " " Oh ? " " It 's not often one meets a famous author . " " I 'm not , no , not at all . " " You 're too modest . I liked your book very much . Yes . " " You 've read it ? " Peter Marlowe stared at him . " Really ? " He sat and looked at Toda , who was much shorter than he , lithe and well built , more handsome and well dressed in a blue suit , a camera hanging on his chair , his eyes equally level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you find it ? " " In Tokyo . We have many English bookshops . Please excuse me , I read the paperback , not the hardback . There was no hardback on sale . Your novel was very illuminating . " " Oh ? " Peter Marlowe took out his cigarettes and offered them . Toda took one . Casey said , " Smoking 's not good for you , you both know that ! " They smiled at her . " We 'll give them up for Lent , " Peter Marlowe said.  |p885  " Sure . " Peter Marlowe looked back at Toda . " You were army ? " " No , Mr. Marlowe . Navy . Destroyers . I was at the Battle of the Coral Sea in ' 42 , then at Midway , sub-lieutenant , later at Guadalcanal . I was sunk twice but lucky . Yes , I was lucky , apparently more lucky than you . " " We 're both alive , both in one piece , more or less . " " More or less , Mr. Marlowe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Toda puffed his cigarette . " Sometime , if it would please you and not hurt , I would like to talk about your Changi , about its lessons and our wars . Please ? " " Sure . " " I 'm here for a few days , " Toda said . " At the Mandarin , back next week . A lunch , or dinner perhaps ? " " Thank you . I 'll call . If not this time perhaps next . One day I 'll be in Tokyo . " After a pause the Japanese said , " We need not discuss your Changi , if you wish . I would like to know you better . England and Japan have much in common . Now if you 'll excuse me , I think I should place my bet . " He bowed politely and walked off . Casey sipped her coffee . " Was that very hard for you ? Being polite ? " " Oh no , Casey . No , it was n't , not at all . Now we 're equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and Koreans  --  I hated were the ones with bayonets and bullets when I had none . " She saw him wipe the sweat off , noticing his twisted smile . " ' Mahlu , I was n't ready to meet one here . " ' Mahlu ? What 's that , Cantonese ? " " Malayan . It means ' ashamed . " He smiled to himself . It was a contractionof puki mahlu . Mahlu ashamed , puki a Golden Gulley . Malays grant feelings to that part of a woman : hunger , sadness , kindness , rapaciousness , hesitancy , shame , anger  --  anything and everything . " No need to be ashamed , Peter , " she said , not understanding . " I 'm astonishedyou 'd talk to any of them after all that POW horror . Oh I really liked the book . Is n't it marvelous that he 'd read it too ? " " Yes . That threw me . " " May I ask you one question ? " " What ? " " You said Changi was genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Changi changed everyone , changed values permanently . For instance , it gave you a dullness about death  --  we saw too much of it to have the same sort of meaning to outsiders , to normal people . We 're a generationof dinosaurs , we the few who survived . I suppose anyone who goes to war , any war , sees life with different eyes if they end up in one piece . " " What do you see ? " " A lot of bull that 's worshipped as the be-all and end-all of existence . So much of normal , civilized ' life is bull that you ca n't imagine it . For us exChangi-ites  --  we'relucky , we 're cleansed , we know what life is really allp886about . What frightens you , does n't frighten me , what frightens me , you 'd laugh at . " " Like what ? " He grinned at her . " That 's enough about me and my karma . I 've a hot tip for th  --  " He stopped and stared off . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Riko Gresserhoff . She 's Japanese . " " Which one 's Mr. Gresserhoff ? " " She 's a widow . " " Hallelujah ! " They watched her go across the room , out onto the terrace . " Do n't you dare , Peter ! " His voice became Olympian . " I 'm a writer ! It 's a matter of research ? " " Baloney ! " " You 're right . " " Peter , they say all first novels are autobiographical . Who were you in the book ? " " The hero of course . " " The King ? The American trader ? " " Oh no . Not him . And that 's quite enough of my past . Let 's talk about you . You sure you 're all right ? " His eyes held hers , willing the truth out of her . " What ? " " There was a rumor that you were in tears last night . " " Nonsense . " " Sure ? " She looked back at him , knowing he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . " A hesitation . " Sometime , sometime I might need a favor . " " Oh ? " He frowned . " I 'm in McBride 's box , two down the hall . It 's quite okay to visit if you want . " He glanced off at Riko . His pleasure faded . Now she was talking to Robin Grey and Julian Broadhurst , the Labour MPs . " Guess it 's not my day , " he muttered . " I 'll be back later , got to bet . See you , Casey . " " What 's your hot tip ? " " Number seven , Winner 's Delight . " Winner 's Delight , an outsider , won handily by half a length over the favorite , Excellent Day . Hugely pleased with herself , Casey joined the line in front of the winner 's pay window clutching her winning tickets , well aware of the envious stares of others who walked along the corridor outside the boxes . Agonized bettors were already putting down their money at other windows for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quinella . To win a quinella they had to forecast the first and secondrunners in any order . The double quinella put the second race together with the fifth that was today 's big race . The double quinella payout would be huge , the odds against forecasting four horses immense . The minimum bet was 5 HK . There was no maximum . " Why 's that , Linc ? "  |p887she  had asked just before the race , craning over the balcony watching the horses in the gate , all Hong Kong yan with their binoculars focused . " Look at the tote . " The electronic numbers were flashing and changing as money went onto different horses , narrowing the odds , to freeze just beforethe off . " Look at the total money invested on this race , Casey ! It 's better than three and a half million Hong Kong . That 's almost a dollar for every man woman and child in Hong Kong and it 's only the first race . This 's got ta be the richest track in the world ! These guys are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starters ' gate opened . She had looked at him and smiled . " You okay ? " " Sure . You ? " " Oh yes . " Yes I am , she thought again , waiting her turn to collect her money . I 'm a winner ! She laughed out loud . " Oh hello , Casey ! Ah , you won too ? " " Oh ! Oh hello , Quillan , yes I did . " She moved out of her place back to Gornt , the others in the line all strangers to her . " I only had ro on her but yes I won . " " The amount does n't matter , it 's the winning . " Gornt smiled . " I like your hat . " " Thank you . " Curious , she thought , both Quillan and Ian had mentioned it immediately . Damn Linc ! " It 's very lucky to pick the first winner , first time at the track . " " Oh I did n't . It was a tip . Peter gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marlowe . " She saw his eyes change slightly . " You 're still on for tomorrow ? " " Oh . Oh yes . Is it weather permitting ? " " Even if it 's raining . Lunch anyway . " " Great . The dock at ten sharp . Which 's your box ? " She noticed an instantchange which he tried to hide . " I do n't have one . I 'm not a steward . Yet . I 'm a fairly permanent guest at the Blacs box and from time to time I borrow the whole place for a party . It 's down the corridor . Would you care to come by ? Blacs is an excellentbank an  --  " " Ah but not as good as the Vic , " Johnjohn called out good-naturedly as he passed . " Do n't believe a word he says , Casey . Congratulations ! Good joss to get the first . See you both later . " Casey watched him thoughtfully . Then she said , " What about all the bank runs , Quillan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not happening , the stock market 's not crashing , and there 's no pending doom . " Gornt laughed , conscious of the ears that were tuned to their conversation . " Today is race day , a rarity , and tomorrow will take care of tomorrow . Joss ! The stock market opens ro:oo A.M. Monday and next week willp888decide a lot of fates . Meanwhile every Chinese who could get his money out , has it in his fist , here today . Casey , it 's your turn . " She collected her money . 15 to one . 150 HK . " Hallelujah ! " Gornt collected a vast bundle of red notes , 15,000 . " Hey , fantastic ! " " Worst race I 've ever seen , " a sour American voice said . " Hell , it was fantastic they did n't bust the jockey and disallow the win . " " Oh hello , Mr. Biltzmann , Mr. Pugmire . " Casey remembered them from the night of the fire . " Bust who ? " Biltzmann stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection a mile wide . Coming into the straight out of the last bend you could see ExcellentDay 's jockey pull the bejesus out of her . It was a fix  --  he was n't trying . " Those in the know , the very few , smiled to themselves . The whisper in the jockeys ' rooms and trainers ' rooms had been that Excellent Day was n't to win but Winner 's Delight would . " Come now , Mr. Biltzmann , " Dunross said . Unnoticed , he 'd heard the exchange as he was passing and had stopped . " If the jockey was n't trying , or if there was any tampering , the stewards would be on to it at once . " " Maybe it 's okay for amateurs , Ian , and this little track but on any professionaltrack at home , Excellent Day 's jockey 'd be banned for the rest of his life . I had my glasses on him all the time . " Biltzmann sourly collected his place winnings and stomped off . Dunross said quietly , " Pug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't watch the race myself . " " No , no I did n't . " " Anyone ? " Those nearby shook their heads . " Seemed all right to me , " someone said . " Nothing out of the ordinary . " " None of the stewards queried anything . " Then Dunross noticed the large roll of notes in Gornt 's hand . He looked up at him . " Quillan ? " " No . But I must tell you frankly I find that berk 's manner appalling . I hardly think he 'd be a proper addition to the Turf Club . " Just then he saw Robin Grey go past to place a bet and smiled at a sudden thought . " Excuse me , will you ? " He nodded politely and walked off . Casey saw Dunross watching the roll of notes that Gornt put into a pocket and was inwardly aghast at the momentary look on his face . " Could Biltzmann . . . could he 've been correct ? " she asked nervously . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fixing happens everywhere . That 's really not the point . There 's been no objection from any of the stewards or jockeys or trainers . " His eyes were slate gray . The small vein in his forehead was pulsating . " That 's not the real point at issue . " No , he was thinking . It 's a matter of bloody manners . Even so , calm yourself . You have to be very cool and very calm and very collected this weekend . All day he had had nothing but trouble . The only bright moment had been Riko Anjin Gresserhoff . But then AMG 's last letter had once morep889filled him with gloom . It was still in his pocket and it had told him that if by chance he had not destroyed the original files , to heat a dozen specified pages that were spread throughout , the secret information written in invisibleink on these pages to be passed privately to the prime minister or the current head of MI-6 , Edward Sinders , personally  --  and a copy given to Riko Anjin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to admit the files I gave him were false , he thought , weary of AMC , espionage and his instructions . Goddamnit , Murtaghdoes n't arrive till later , Sir Geoffrey ca n't call London till 4:00 P.M. about Tiptop and Brian Kwok and , Christ Jesus , now some rude bastard calls us all amateurs . . . which we are . I 'll bet a hundred to a bent hatpin Quillan knew before the race . At a sudden thought he said casually , " How did you pick the winner , Casey ? With the proverbial pin ? " " Peter gave it to me . Peter Marlowe . " Her face changed . " Oh ! Do you think he heard it was fixed ? " " If I thought that for a moment , the race would have been set aside . There 's nothing I can do now . Biltzmann . . . " Suddenly he gasped as the idea hit him in all its glory . " What 's the matter ? " Dunross took her arm and led her aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to gamble ? " he asked softly . " Sure , sure , Ian , if it 's legal . But gamble what ? " she asked , her innate caution uppermost . " Everything you 've got in the bank , your house in Laurel Canyon , your stock in Par-Con against 2. to 4 million within thirty days . How about it ? " Her heart was thumping , his obvious excitement sweeping her . " Okay , " she said and then wished she had n't said it , her stomach fluttering . " Jesus ! " " Good . Stay here a second . I 'll go and find Bartlett . " " Wait ! Is he part of this ? What is this , Ian ? " He beamed . " A modest business opportunity . Yes , Bartlett 's essential . Does that make you change your mind ? " " No , " she told him uneasily , " but I said I wanted to get my . . . my stake outside of Par-Con . " " I have n't forgotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found Bartlett and brought him back , led the way down the bustling corridor to the Struan kitchen , greeting people here and there . The kitchen was small , busy and sparkling . The staff paid no attention to them . A door opened into a tiny private room , carefully soundproofed . Four chairs , a table and phone . " My father had this constructed during his tenure  --  lots of business is done at the races . Sit down please . Now "  --  he looked at Bartlett  --  " I 've a business proposal for you , for you and Casey as individuals , outside of our Par-Con deal , nothing to do with the Par-Con  --  Struan proposal . Are you interested ? "  |p890  " Sure . This a Hong Kong scam ? " " Do you mind ? " Dunross beamed . " It 's an honest-to-God Hong Kong business proposal . " " Okay , let 's have it . " " Before I lay it out there are ground rules : It 's my game , you two 're bystandersbut you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shared equally between you two . Okay ? " " What 's the full game plan , Ian ? " Bartlett asked cautiously . " Next : You put up $z million U.S. by Monday 9:0o A.M. into a Swiss bank of my choosing . " Bartlett 's eyes narrowed . " Against what ? " " Against 49 percent of the profit . " " What profit ? " " You put up $2 million for Gornt , no paper , no chop , no nothing exceptagainst potential profit . " Bartlett grinned . " How long have you known about that ? " Dunross smiled back . " I told you , there 're no secrets here . Are you in ? " Dunross saw Bartlett glance at Casey and he held his breath . " Casey , you know what this 's all about ? " " No , Linc . " Casey turned to Dunross . " What is the scam , Ian ? " " First I want to know if I get the z million advance free and clear  --  if you go for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Casey asked " $4 to $12 million . Tax free . " Casey blanched . " Tax free ? " " Free of any Hong Kong taxes and we can help you avoid States taxes if you want . " " What 's . . . what 's the payout period ? " Bartlett asked . " The profit 'll be set in thirty days . The payout will take five to six months . " " The $4 to $12 million 's the total , or our share only ? " " Your share . " " That 's a lot of profit for something completely , twenty-four-carat legal . " There was a great silence . Dunross waited , willing them onward . " $2 million cash ? " Bartlett said . " No security , no nothing ? " " No . But after I 've laid it out you can put up or pass . " " What 's Gornt to do with this ? " " Absolutely nothing . This venture has nothing to do with Gornt , Rothwell-Gornt , Par-Con , your interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally outside , whatever happens  --  my word on that . And my word beforeGod , that I 'll never tell him you 've put up this $2 million , that you two are my partners and in for a piece  --  or , by the way , that I know about the three of you selling me short . " He smiled . " That was a very good idea by the way . "  |p891  " The deal 's swung by my $2 million ? " " No . Greased . I have n't $2 million U.S. cash as you know , otherwise you would n't be invited in . " " Why us , Ian ? You could raise 2 mill from one of your friends here , easy , if it 's so good . " " Yes . But I choose to sweeten the lure to you two . By the way , you are held to Tuesday at midnight . " Dunross said it flat . Then his voice changed and the others felt the glee . " But with this  --  this business venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rothwell-Gornt , how much more exciting it 'll be being associated with us than him . You 're a gambler , so am I. Raider Bartlett they call you and I 'm tai-pan of the Noble House . You gambled a paltry $z million with Gornt , with no chop , why not with me ? " Bartlett glanced at Casey . She gave him neither a yes or a no though he knew the lure had her in spades . " Since you 're setting the rules , Ian , answer me this : I put up the $z million . Why should we share equally , Casey and I ? " " I remember what you said over dinner about drop dead money . You 've got yours , she has n't . This could be a device to get her hers . " " Why 're you so concerned over Casey ? You trying to divide and rule ? " " If that 's possible then you should n't be in a very special partnership and business relationship . She 's your right arm , you told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Par-Con so she 's entitled to share . " " What does she risk ? " " She 'll put up her house , her savings , her Par-Con stock  --  that 's everything she has  --  alongside yours . She 'll sign it all over for a half share . Right ? " Casey nodded , numb . " Sure . " Sharply Bartlett glanced at Casey . " I thought you said you knew nothing about this ? " She looked at him . " Couple of minutes ago , Ian asked if I 'd gamble my all to get some drop dead money , big money . " She gulped and added , " I said okay and already wish I had n't . " Bartlett thought a moment . " Casey , blunt : You want in or you want out ? " " In . " " Okay . " Then Bartlett beamed . " Okay , tai-pan , now who do we have to kill ? " Nine Carat Chu , who was a sometime gold coolie for the Victoria Bank and also the father of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's occasional friend and Wisteria who was John Chen 's mistress , whose joss was to be trampled to death outside the Ho-Pak at Aberdeen  --  waited his turn at the betting window.  |p892  " Yes , old man ? " the impatient teller said . He pulled out a roll of money . It was all the money he had and all the money he could borrow , leaving only enough for three inhalations of the White Powder that he would need to see him through , his night shift tonight . " The double quinella , by all the gods ! Eight and five in the second race , seven and one in the fifth . " The teller methodically counted out the crumpled bills . 728 HK . He pressed the buttons of those numbers and checked the first ticket . It was correct : five and eight  --  second race ; seven and one  --  fifth race . Carefully he counted 145 tickets , each of 5 HK , the minimum bet , and gave them to him with 3 HK change . " Hurry up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out . " Are your fingers in your Black Hole ? " " Be patient ! " the old man muttered , feeling faint , " this is serious business ! " Carefully he checked his tickets . The first , three random ones and the last were correct , and the number of tickets correct , so he gave up his place and pushed his way out of the press into the air . Once in the air he felt a little better , still nauseated but better . He had walked all the way from his night shift of work at the construction site of the new high rise up above Kotewall Road in Mid Levels to save the fare . Again he checked his tickets . Eight and five in this race and seven and one in the fifth , the big race . Good , he thought , putting them carefully into his pocket . I 've done the best I can . Now it is up to the gods . His chest was hurting him very much so he fought through the crowd to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke from the bubbling White Powder . In time he felt better and went outside again . The second race was already on . Beside himself with anxiety he pushed and shoved his way to the rails , careless of the curses that followed him . The horses were rounding the far bend , galloping toward him into the last straight for the winning post , now past in a thundering blur as he strained his rheumy old eyes to find his numbers . " Who 's leading ? " he gasped but no one paid any attention to him , just shouted their own choice on to victory in a growing seething roar that was all possessing , then vanished as the winner won . " Who won ? " Nine Carat Chu gasped , his head exploding . " Who cares ! " someone said with a stream of curses . " It was n't mine ! All gods piss on that jockey forever ! " " I ca n't read the tote , who won ? " " It was a photo finish , old fool , ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fornicate all photo finishes ! We must wait . " " But the numbers . . . . what are the numbers ? " " Five and eight and four , Lucky Court , my horse ! Come on you son of a whore 's left tit ! Four and eight for the quinella by all the gods ! " They waited . And waited . The old man thought he would faint so he put his mind on to better things , like his conversation with Noble House Chen this morning . Three times he had called and each time a servantp893had answered and hung up . It was only when he had said " Werewolf " that Noble House Chen himself had come to the phone . " Please excuse me for mentioning the terrible slayers of your son , " he had said . " It was n't me , Honored Sir , oh no . I am just the father of your late honorable son 's mistress , Wisteria Su , to whom he has written his undyinglove in the letter that was printed in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies . Do you think I 'm a fool to be squeezed by any dog meat caller ? Who are you ? " " My name is Hsi-men Su , " he had said , the lie coming easily . " There are two more letters , Honorable Chen . I thought you might wish to have them back even though they 're all we have from my poor dead daughter and your poor dead son who I considered like my own son over all the months that he an  --  " " More lies ! The mealy-mouthed strumpet never had any letters from my son ! Our deadly police put forgers in jail , oh yes ! Am I a peasantheadedmonkey from the Outer Provinces ? Beware ! Now I suppose you 'll produce an infant that you 'll claim my son sired ? Eh ? Eh ? " Nine Carat Chu almost dropped the phone . He had discussed and arrangedthat very ploy with his wife and his sons and Lily . It had been easy to find a relation who would lend a babe in arms for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " am I a liar ? Me who fairly , for modest cash , gave his only virgin daughter to be your son 's whore and only love . " He used the English words carefully , his daughter Lily having coached him for hours so that he could say it properly . " By all the gods we 've protectedyour great name at no charge ! When we went to claim my poor daughter 's body we did not tell the deadly police who desire , oh ko , yes , who desire to find out who the writer was to trap the Werewolves ! All gods curse those evil sons of whores ! Have n't four Chinese papers already offered rewards for the name of the writer , heya ? It is only fair I offer the letters to you before collecting the newspapers ' reward , heya ? " Patiently he had listened to the stream of invective that had begun the negotiation . Several times both sides had pretended they were going to put the phone down , but neither side broke off the bargaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the other letters was sent to Noble House Chen as proof that it and the others were no forgery , then " it might be , Honorable Su , the other letters  --  and this one  --  might be worth a very modest amount of Fragrant Grease . " Nine Carat Chu chortled to himself now . Oh yes , he thought contentedly , Noble House Chen will pay handsomely , particularly when he reads the parts about himself . Oh if those were printed surely it would hold him up to ridicule before all Hong Kong and take his face away forever . Now , how much should I settle fA sudden roar surrounded him and he almost fell over . His heart began pounding , his breath short . He held on to the rails and peered at the distanttote . " Who . . . what axe the numbers ? " he asked , then screechedp894over the noise and tugged at his neighbors . " The numbers , tell me the numbers ! " " The winner 's eight , Buccaneer , the gelding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tai-pan leading him into the winner 's circle now ? Buccaneer 's paying 7 to i . " " The second ? Who was the second horse ? " " Number five , Winsome Lady , 3 to r for a place . . . . What 's wrong , old man , have you a palsy ? " " No . . . no . . . " Weakly Nine Carat Chu groped away . At length he found a small empty patch of concrete and spread his racing form on the wet concrete and sat down , his head on his knees and arms , his mind sweeping him into the ecstasy of winning the first leg . Oh oh oh ! And nothing to do now but wait , and if the time of waiting is too long I will use one more of the White Powders , yes , and that will leave me the last to see me through tonight 's work . Now , all gods concentrate ! The first leg was won by my own shrewdness . Please concentrate on the fifth ! Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winner 's circle the stewards and owners and officials clustered . Dunross had intercepted his horse and congratulated the jockey . Buccaneer had run a fine race and now as he led the gelding into the winner'scircle amid another burst of cheering and congratulations he kept his exuberance deliberately open . He wanted to let the world see his pleasure and confidence , very aware that winning this race was an immense omen , over and above the fact of winning . The omen would be doubled and tripledif he won with Noble Star . Two horses in the double quinella would absolutely set Cornt and his allies back on their heels . And if Murtagh works his magic or if Tiptop keeps his bargain to swap the money for Brian Kwok or if Tightfist or Lando or Four Fingers .. . " Hey , Mr. Dunross , sir , congratulations ! " Dunross glanced at the crowd on the rails . " Oh hello , Mr. Choy , " he said , recognizing Four Finger Wu 's Seventh Son and supposed nephew . He went closer and shook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes sir , sure , I 'm with the Noble House all the way ! We 're on the doublequinella , my uncle and me . We just won the first leg five and eight , and we 've seven and eight in the fifth . He 's got ro , 000 riding , me , my whole week 's salary ! " " Then let 's hope we win , Mr. Choy . " " You can say that again , tai-pan , " the young man said with his easy American familiarity . Dunross smiled and walked over to Travkin . " Are you sure Johnny Moore ca n't ride Noble Star ? I do n't want Tom Wong . " " I told you , tai-pan , Johnny 's sicker than a drunken cossack . " " I need the win . Noble Star is to win . "  |p895Travkin  saw Dunross look at Buccaneer speculatively . " No , tai-pan , please do n't ride Noble Star . The going 's bad , very bad and very dangerousand it 'll get worse as they hack up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to ride her more . " " My future could ride on that race  --  and the face of the Noble House . " " I know . " Angrily the gnarled old Russian slapped the switch he carried perpetually against his ancient jodhpurs , shining with use . " And I know you 're better than all the other jockeys but that turf 's danger  --  " " I do n't trust anyone in this , Alexi . I ca n't afford any mistake . " Dunross dropped his voice . " Was the first race fixed ? " Travkin stared back levelly . " They were n't doped , tai-pan . Not to my knowledge . The police doctor has put the fear of God into those who might be tempted . " " Good . But was it fixed ? " " It was n't my race , tai-pan . I 'm only interested in my horses and my races . I did n't watch that race . " " That 's convenient , Alexi . Seems that none of the other trainers did ei-ther . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Me . I 'll ride Noble Star . " Dunross 's eyes narrowed . He glanced at the sky . It was darker than before . There 'll be rain soon , he thought and there 's much to do before the rain . Me or Alexi ? Alexi 's legs are good , his hands the best , his experience immense . But he thinks more of the horse than of winning . " I 'll consider it , " he said . " After the fourth race I 'll decide . " " I 'll win , " the older man said , desperate for the chance to extricate himself from his agreement with Suslev . " I 'll win even if I have to kill Noble Star . " " No need to do that , Alexi . I 'm rather fond of that horse . " " Tai-pan , listen , perhaps a favor ? I 've a problem . Can I see you tonight or Sunday , Sunday or Monday late , say at Sinclair Towers ? " " Why there ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . But if it 's not all right the day after . " " You 're going to leave us ? " " Oh no , no it 's not that . If you 've time . Please . " " All right but it ca n't be tonight , or Sunday or Monday , I 'm going to Taipei . I could see you Tuesday at to:oo P.M. How 's that ? " " Fine , Tuesday 's fine yes , thank you . " " I 'll be down after the next race . " Alexi watched the tai-pan walk for the elevators . He was near tears , an overwhelming affection for Dunross possessing him . His eyes went to Suslev who was in the general stands nearby . Trying to appear casual he held up the prearranged number of fingers : one for tonight , two for Sunday , three Monday , four Tuesday . His eyes were very good and he saw Suslev acknowledge the signal . Matyeryebyets , hep896thought . Betrayer of Mother Russia and all us Russians , you and all your KGB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for me and all Russians if the truth be known . Never mind that ! I 'm going to ride Noble Star , he told himself grimly , one way or another . Dunross got into the elevator amid more congratulations and much envy . At the top floor Gavallan and Jacques were waiting for him . " Is everythingready ? " he asked . " Yes , " Gavallan replied . " Gomt 's there , and the others you wanted . What 's cooking ? " " Come along and you 'll see . By the way , Andrew , I 'm switching Jacques and David MacStruan . Jacques will take over Canada for a year , David  --  " Jacques 's face lit up . " Oh thank you tai-pan . Yes , thanks very much . I 'll make Canada very profitable , I promise . " " What about the changeover ? " Gavallan asked . " Do you want Jacques to go there first or will David come here ? " " He arrives Monday . Jacques , you hand over everything to David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple of weeks . You go via France , eh ? Pick up Susanne and Avril , she should be well enough by then . There 's nothing urgent in Canada at the moment  --  it 's more urgent here . " " Oh yes , ma foil Yes , yes thank you , tai-pan . " Gavallan said thoughtfully , " It 'll be good to see old David . " He liked David MacStruan very much but he was still wondering why the change , and did this mean that Jacques was out of the running to inherit the taipan'smantle and David in and his own position changed , changing or threatened  --  if there was anything left to inherit after Monday . And what about Kathy ? Joss , he told himself . What is to be will be . Oh goddamn everything ! " You two go on ahead , " Dunross said . " I 'll get Phillip . " He turned into the Chen box . By ancient custom the compradore of the Noble House was automatically a steward . Perhaps for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't deliver help in the form of Four Finger Wu , Lando Mata , Tightfist or something tangible by Sunday at midnight he 's blackballed . " Hello , Phillip , " he said , his voice friendly , greeting the other guests in the packed box . " You ready ? " " Oh yes , yes , tai-pan . " Phillip Chen was looking older . " Congratulationson the win . " " Yes , tai-pan , a marvelous omen  --  we 're all praying for the fifth ! " Dianne Chen called out , trying equally hard to hide her apprehension , Kevin beside her , echoing her . ' Thank you , " Dunross said , sure that Phillip Chen had told her aboutp897their meeting . She wore a hat with bird of paradise feathers , and too many jewels . " Champagne , tai-pan ? " " No thanks , later perhaps . Sorry , Dianne , have to borrow Phillip for a moment or two . Wo n't be long . " Outside in the corridor he stopped a moment . " Any luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've talked to all the . . . all of them . They 're meeting tomorrowmorning . " " Where ? Macao ? " " No , here . " Phillip Chen dropped his voice even more . " I 'm sorry about ... about all the mess my son 's caused ... yes , very sorry , " he said , meaning it . " I accept your apology . If it had n't been for your carelessness and treachery , we 'd never have become that vulnerable . Christ Jesus , if Gornt gets our balance sheets for the last few years and our interlocking corporatestructures , we 're up the creek without a paddle . " " I . . . I had a thought , tai-pan , how to extract our  --  how to extract the House . After the races , could I . . . a little time , please ? " " You 're coming for drinks tonight ? With Dianne ? " " Yes , if . . . yes please . May I bring Kevin ? " Dunross smiled fleetingly to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karma . " Yes . Come along . " " What 's this all about , tai-pan ? " " You 'll see . Please say nothing , do nothing , just accept  --  with great confidence  --  that you 're part of the package , and when I leave follow me , spread the word and good cheer . If we fail , the House of Chen fails first , come hell , high water or typhoon ! " He turned into the McBride box . There were more immediate congratulations and many said it was great joss . " Good God , tai-pan , " McBride said , " if Noble Star wins the fifth , would n't it be marvelous ! " " Pilot Fish will beat Noble Star , " Gornt said confidently . He was at the bar with Jason Plumm getting a drink . " ro , 000 says he 'll finish ahead of your filly . " " Taken , " Dunross said at once . There were cheers and hoots of derision from the thirty-odd guests and once more Bartlett and Casey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes ago to visit Peter Marlowe , were inwardly staggered at the festive air and Dunross 's high-flying confidence . " How 're you doing , Dunstan ? " Dunross asked . He paid Casey and Bartlett no attention , concentrating on the big florid man who was more florid than usual , a double brandy in his hand . " Very well , thank you , Ian . Got the first , and Buccaneer  --  made a bundleon Buccaneer , but blew my damned quinella . Lucky Court let me down . "  |p898The  room was the same size as the Struan box but not as well decorated , though equally well filled with many of the Hong Kong elite , some invited here a moment ago by Gavallan and McBride for Dunross . Lando Mata , Holdbrook  --  Struan 's in-house stockbroker  --  Sir Luis Basilio  --  head of the stock exchange  --  Johnjohn , Havergill , Southerby  --  chairman of Blacs  --  Richard Kwang , Pugmire , Biltzmann , Sir Dunstan Barre , young Martin Haply of the China Guardian . And Gornt . Dunross looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last race too ? " " No . I did n't fancy any runner . What 's all this about , Ian ? " Gornt said , and everyone 's attention soared . " You want to make an announcement ? " " Yes , as a courtesy I thought you should know , along with other VIPs . " Dunross turned to Pugmire . " Pug , the Noble House is formally contesting the American Superfoods takeover of your H.K. General Stores . " There was a vast silence and everyone stared at him . Pugmire had gone white . " What ? " " We 're offering $5 a share more than Superfoods , we 'll further improve their bid by making it 30 percent cash and 70 percent stock , everything done within thirty days ! " " You 've gone mad , " Pugmire burst out . Did n't I sound everyone out first , he wanted to shout , including you ? Did n't you and everyone approve or at least not disapprove ? Is n't that the way it 's done here for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the races , over a private dinner or wherever ? " You ca n't do that , " he muttered . " I already have , " Dunross said . Got ta said harshly , " All you 've done , Ian , is to make an announcement . How are you going to pay ? In thirty or three hundred days . " Dunross just looked at him . " The bid 's public . We complete in thirty days . Pug , you 'll get the official papers by 9:30 A.M. Monday , with a cash down payment to cement the tender . " Momentarily he was drowned out as others began talking , asking questions , everyone immediately concerned how this astonishing development would affect them personally . No one had ever contested a prearranged takeover before . Johnjohn and Havergill were furious that this had been done without consultation , and the other banker , Southerby of Blacs , who was merchant-banking the Superfoods takeover , was equally upset that he had been caught off balance . But all the bankers , even Richard Kwang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal and Struan 's stock at its normal level , the Struan bid could be very good for both sides . Everyone knew that Struan 's management could revitalize the rich but stagnant hong , and the acquisition would strengthen the Noble House immeasurably , put their end-of-year gross up at least 20 percent and of course increase their dividends . On top of all that , the takeover would keep all the profits in Hong Kong , and not have them trickle away to an outsider . Particularly Biltzmann . Oh my God , Barre was thinking with vast admiration and not a littlep899envy , for Ian to make the tender here , in public , on a Saturday , with never the breath of a rumor that he was contemplating the unthinkable , with nothing to give you an inkling so that you could have bought in quietly last week at bottom to make a fortune with one phone call , was brilliant . Of course Pug 's General Stores shares will soar first thing on Monday . But how in the hell did Ian and Havergill keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd known , perhaps I still can ! The rumors about the Victoria not supporting Struan 's is obviously a lot of cobblers ... . Wait a minute , Sir Luis Basilio was thinking , did n't we buy a huge block of General Stores last week for a nominee buyer ? Good God , has the tai-pan outsmarted all of us ? But Madonna , wait a minute , what about the run on his stock , what about the market crashing , what about the cash he 'll have to put up to fix the tender , what about .. . Even Gornt was counting , his mind flooded with fury that he had not thought of the ploy first . He knew the bid was good , perfect in fact , that he could not top it , not at the moment . But then , Ian ca n't complete . There 's no wa " Can we go to press on this , tai-pan ? " Martin Haply 's incisive Canadian voice cut through the excited uproar . " Certainly , Mr. Haply . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends what they are , " Dunross said easily . Looking at the penetratingbrown eyes , he was grimly amused . We could use a right rotten young bastard in the family  --  if he could be trusted with Adryon . " What had you in mind ? " " This 's the first time a takeover 's ever been contested . May I ask why you 're doing it at this time ? " " Struan 's have always been innovative . As to timing , we considered it perfect . " " Do you consider this Sat  --  " Biltzmann interrupted harshly , " We have a deal . It 's set . Dickie ? " He whirled on Pugmire . " Eh ? " " It was all set , Mr. Biltzmann , " Dunross said crisply . " But we 're contesting your tender , just as it 's done in the States , according to Americanrules . I presume you do n't mind a contest ? Of course we are amateurs here but we enjoy trying to learn from our peers . Until the stockholders ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " " Yes , but . . . but it was set ! " The tall gray-haired man turned to Pugcnirc , hardly able to speak he was so angry . " You said it was all agreed . " " Well , the directors had agreed , " Pugmire said uneasily , conscious of everyone listening , particularly Haply , one half of him ecstatic with the vastly improved offer , the other furious that he , too , had had no advance warning so he could have bought in heavily . " But , er , but of course it has to be ratified by the stockholders at the Friday meeting . We had no ideap900there 'd be a . . . Er , Ian , er , Chuck , do n't you think this is hardly the place to dis  --  " " I agree , " the tai-pan said . " But at the moment there 's little to discuss . The offer 's made . By the way , Pug , your own deal stands , except that it 's extended from five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board for the same period . " Pugmire 's mouth dropped open . " That 's part of the tender ? " " We 'd need your expertise , of course , " Dunross said airily , and everyoneknew Pugmire was hooked and landed . " The rest of the package as negotiated by you and Superfoods stands . The papers will be on your desk by 9:30 . Perhaps you 'll put our tender to your stockholders on Friday . " He went over to Biltzmann and put out his hand . " Good luck . I presume you 'll be coming back with a counteroffer at once . " " Well , er , I have to check with head office , Mr. , er , tai-pan . " Biltzmann was flushed and angry . " We ... we put our best foot forward and .. . That 's a mighty fine offer you made . Yes . But with the run on your stock , the run on the banks and the market going down , that 's going to be kinda hard to close , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dunross said , gambling everything that Bartlett would not renege on the promise of cash , that he would close with Par-Con , extricate himself from Gornt and put his stock back into its rightfulplace by next weekend . " We can close with no trouble at all . " Biltzmann 's voice sharpened . " Dickie , I think you 'd better consider our bid carefully . It 's good till Tuesday , " he said , confident that by Tuesday Struan 's would be in a shambles . " Now I 'll make me a bet on the next race . " He stalked out . Tension in the box went up several decibels . Everyone began talking but Haply called out , " Tai-pan , may I ask a question ? " Again attention zeroed . " What is it ? " " I understand it 's customary in takeovers for there to be a down payment , in cash , a measure of good faith . May I ask how much Struan 's is putting up ? " Everyone waited breathlessly , watching Dunross . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoying the excitement , knowing everyone wanted him humbled , almost everyone , except . . . except who ? Casey for one , even though she 's in the know . Bartlett ? I do n't know , not for certain . Claudia ? Oh yes , Claudia was staring at him , white-faced . Donald McBride , Gavallan , even Jacques . His eyes stopped on Martin Haply . " Perhaps Mr. Pugmire would prefer to have that detail in private , " he said , leading them on . " Eh , Pug ? " Gornt interrupted Pugmire and said , as a challenge , " Ian , since you 've decided to be unorthodox , why not make it all public ? How much you put down measures the value of your tender . Does n't it ? " " No . Not really , " Dunross said . He heard the distant muted roar of the off for the third race and was sure , watching the faces , that no one heardp901it except him . " Oh , very well , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. , with the papers at 9:30 Monday ? In good faith . " A gasp went through the room . Havergill , Johnjohn , Southerby , Gornt , were aghast . Phillip Chen almost fainted . Involuntarily Havergill began , " Ian , do n't you think we , er , th  --  " Dunross wheeled on him . " Oh , do n't you consider it enough , Paul ? " " Oh yes , yes of course , more than enough , but , er . . . " Havergill 's words trailed off under Dunross 's gaze . " Oh for a moment . . . " Dunross stopped , pretending to have a sudden thought , " Oh , you need n't worry , Paul , I have n't committed you without your approval of course . I have alternate financing for this deal , external financing , " he continued with his easy charm . " As you know , Japanese banks and many others are anxious to expand into Asia . I thought it better  --  to keep everything secret and prevent the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce . Fortunately the Noble House has friends all over the world ! See you all later ! " Ile turned and left . Phillip Chen followed . Martin Haply started for the phone and then everyone was talking and saying I do n't believe it , Christ if Ian 's got that sort of external funds . . In the hubbub Havergill asked Johnjohn , " Which Japanese bank ? " " I wish I knew . If Ian 's got finance for this ... my God , $2 million t I.S. 's twice as much as he needed to offer . " Southerby , who was alongside them , wiped his palms . " If Ian pulls this off it 'll be worth $ro million U.S. the first year at least . " He smiled sardonically . " Well , Paul , now it looks as though we 're both out of this particularpie . " " Yes , yes it does , but I just do n't see how Ian could . . . and to keep it so quiet ! " Southerby bent closer . " Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what about Tiptop ? " " Nothing , nothing yet . He has n't returned my calls , or Johnjohn 's . " Havergill 's eyes fell on Gornt who was now talking privately with Plumm . He turned his back on him . " What will Quillan do now ? " " Buy first thing Monday morning . He has to . Has to now , too dangerous to hold on , " Southerby said . " I agree , " Sir Luis Basilio added , joining them . " If Ian can toss that sort of cash around , those who 've been selling him short better watch out . Come to think of it , we 've been buying General Stores for nominees this last week . Probably Ian , eh ? He has to have taken a position , lucky devil ! " " Yes , " Johnjohn muttered . " For the life of me I ca n't figure . . . Good sweet Christ , and now if he wins with Noble Star ! With joss like that he could turn his whole mess about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gornt said , butting in , startling them . " But thank God we 're not all Chinese . We 've yet to see the cash . " " He must have it  --  must have it , " Johnjohn said . " Matter of face . "  |p902  " All , face . " Gomt was sardonic . " 9:30 A.M. , eh ? If he 'd really been smart he would have said noon , or 3:00 P.M. , then we would n't know all day and he could 've manipulated us all day . As it is now . . . " Gornt shrugged . " I win either way , millions , if not control . " He glanced across the noisy box , nodded noncommittally to Bartlett and Casey , then turned away . Bartlett took Casey 's arm and led her on to the balcony . " What do you think ? " he asked softly . " About Gornt ? " " About Dunross . " " Fantastic ! He 's fantastic . Japanese bank '  --  that was a stunning red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put this whole group into a tailspin , you could see that , and if this group , the whole of Hong Kong . You heard what Southerby said ? " " Sure . It looks like we 've all got it made  --  if he can squeeze out of Comt 's trap . " " Let 's hope . " Then she noticed his smile . " What ? " " You know what we just did , Casey ? We just bought the Noble House for the promise of 2 million bucks . " " How ? " " Ian 's gambling I will put up the 2 . " " That 's no gamble , Linc , that was the deal . " " Sure . But say I do n't . His whole pack of cards collapses . If he does n't get the 2 he 's finished . Yesterday I told Gornt I might jerk the rug Mondaymorning . Say I withdraw Ian 's 2 before the market opens . Ian 's down the tube . " She stared at him , appalled . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become the Noble House . Look what Ian did to Biltzmann , what they all did to him That poor bastard did n't know what hit him . Pugmire made a deal but reneged to take Ian 's better offer . Right ? " " That 's different . " She looked at him searchingly . " You 're going to renege after making a deal ? " Bartlett smiled a strange smile , looked down at the packed crowds and at the tote . " Maybe . Maybe that depends on who does what to whom over the weekend . Gomt or Dunross , it 's all the same . " " I do n't agree . " " Sure , Casey , I know , " he said calmly . " But it 's my $2 million and my game . " " Yes , and your word and your face ! You shook on the deal . " " Casey , these guys here would eat us for breakfast if they got the chance . You think Dunross would n't sell us out if he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You 're saying a deal 's never a deal , no matter what ? "  |p903  " You want $4 million tax free ? " " You know the answer to that . " " Say you 're in for 49 percent of the new Par-Con  --  Gornt company , free and clear . It 's got to be worth that . " " More , " she said , afraid of this line of talk and for the first time in her life suddenly not sure of Bartlett . " You want that 49 percent ? " " In return for what , Linc ? " " In return for getting in back of Gornt  --  Par-Con roo percent . " Her stomach felt weak and she looked at him searchingly , trying to read his mind . Normally she could , but not since Orlanda . " Are you offering that ? " He shook his head , his smile the same , his voice the same . " No . Not yet . " She shivered , afraid she would take the deal if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess , yes , I 'm glad . " " The point 's straight and simple , Casey : Dunross and Gornt play the game to win but for different stakes . Why this box would mean more to both of them than $2 or $4 million . We came here , you and I , to profit and to win . " They both glanced at the sky as a few raindrops spattered . But it was from the roof overhang and not a new shower . She began to say something , stopped . " What , Casey ? " " Nothing . " " I 'm going to circulate , see what the reaction is . See you back in our box . " " What about the fifth ? " she asked . " Wait for the odds . I 'll be back before the start . " " Have fun ! " She followed him with her eyes , out of the door , then turned and leaned on the balcony to hide from him and everyone . She had almost blurted out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , before Orlanda  --  before Hong Kong  --  I 'd never have needed to ask that question . Linc would never go back on a deal before . But now , now I 'm not sure . Again she shivered . What about my tears ? I 've never pulled that one before , and what about Murtagh ? Should I tell Linc about Murtagh now  --  or later  --  because he must be told , certainly before 9:30 Monday . Oh God , I wish we 'd never come here . The patter of rain splashed the stadium and someone said , " Christ , I hope it does n't get any worse ! " The track was already scarred and muddy and very slippery . Outside the main entrance the road was slicked , pud/died , traffic heavy and many late-coming people still hurried through the turnstiles . Roger Crosse , Sinders and Robert Armstrong got out of the police car and went through the barriers and the checkpoints to the members ' elevator , their blue lapel badges fluttering . Crosse had been a voting member for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steward this year . Every year the commissioner of police suggested to the stewards that the police should have their own box and each year the stewards agreed enthusiasicallyand nothing happened . In the members ' stand Armstrong lit a cigarette . His face was lined , his eyes tired . The huge , crowded room went half the length of the stands . They went to the bar and ordered drinks , greeting other members . " Who 's that ? " Sinders asked . Armstrong followed his glance . " That 's a little of our local color , Mr. Sinders . " His voice was sardonic . " Her name 's Venus Poon and she 's our top TV starlet . " Venus Poon was wearing a full-length mink and surrounded by an admiringgroup of Chinese . " The fellow on her left 's Charles Wang  --  he 's a film producer , multimillionaire , cinemas , dance halls , nightclubs , bars , girls and a couple of banks in Thailand . The small old man who looks like a bamboo and 's just as tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  smuggling 's his life 's work and he 's very good . " " Yes , " Crosse said . " We almost caught him a couple of days ago . We think he 's into heroin now  --  of course gold . " " Who 's the nervous one in the gray suit ? The fellow on the outside ? " " That 's Richard Kwang of the Ho-Pak disaster , " Armstrong said . " The banker . He 's her current , or was her current  --  what 's the word  --  patron ? " " Interesting . " Sinders concentrated on Venus Poon . Her dress was lowcutand saucy . " Yes , very . And who 's that ? Over there  --  the one with the European . " " Where ? Oh . That 's Orlanda Ramos , Portuguese which usually means Eurasian here . Once she was Quillan Gornt 's mistress . Now , now I do n't know . The man 's Line Bartlett , the gun-runner . " " Ah ! She 's unattached ? " " Perhaps . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed . " Delectable , but expensive . " " I 'd say very , " Crosse told him distastefully . Orlanda Ramos was with several middle-aged women , all couturier dressed , around Bartlett . " Rather overdone for my taste . " Sinders glanced at him , surprised . " I have n't seen so many smashers in years  --  or so many jewels . Have you ever had a raid here ? " Crosse 's eyes soared . " In the Turf Club ? Good God , surely no one 'd dare . " Armstrong smiled his hard smile . " Every copper who does duty here ,  |p905from  the high to the low , spends most of the time trying to work out the perfect heist . The final day 's take must be 15 million at least . It 's baffled us all . Security 's too tight , too clever  --  Mr. Crosse set it up . " " Ah ! " Crosse smiled . " Would you like a snack , Edward ? Perhaps a sand-wich ? " " Good idea . Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . If you do n't mind I 'll study the form and see you later . " Armstrong was achingly aware that after the seventh race , they were due to return to HQ where Brian Kwok was scheduled for another session . " Robert 's a serious punter , Edward . Robert , do me a favor , show Mr. Sinders the ropes , where to bet , and order him a sandwich . I 'd better see if the governor 's free for a moment  --  I 'll be back in a few minutes . " " Glad to , " Armstrong said , hating the idea , the envelope with 40,000 h'eung you dollars that he had taken from his desk on an impulse now a never-ending fire in his pocket . Christ , do I or do n't I ? he asked himself over and over , grimly trying to decide and all the while trying to push away the horror of his friend Brian and the next session  --  no , no longer his friend but a committed , highly trained foreign asset and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Robert , " Crosse said , keeping his voice deliberately kind , " you 've done a very good job today . Very good . " " Yes , " Sinders agreed . " I 'll see the minister 's aware of your help , and of course the CP . " Crosse went for the elevator . Wherever he went nervous Chinese eyes followed him . On the top floor he bypassed the governor 's box and went into Plumm 's . " Hello , Roger ! " Plumm greeted him affably . " Drink ? " " Coffee would be fine . How 're things ? " " Lost my shirt so far , though a number of us have the first leg of the quinella . You ? " " I 've just arrived . " " Oh , then you missed the drama ! " Plumm told Crosse about Dunross 's takeover bid . " Ian 's thrown a monkey wrench into Pug . " " Or given him a great offer , " someone volunteered . " True , true . " Plumm 's box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatter and laughter , drinks and good food . " Tea 'll be up in half an hour . I 'm just going along to the stewards ' committee room , Roger . Would you like to stroll with me ? " The committee room was at the end of the corridor , through guarded swing doors . It was small with a table and twelve chairs , a phone , goodp906windows over the track and a tiny balcony . And empty . At once Plumm 's easygoing facade vanished . " I talked to Suslev . " " Oh ? " " He 's furious about the raid on the Ivanov last night . " " I can imagine . That was ordered by London . I was n't even told till this morning . Bloody Sinders ! " Plumm became even grimmer . " They could n't be on to you , could they ? " " Oh no . It 's routine . Just Special Branch , MI-6 and Sinders flexing their wings . They 're a secretive lot and quite right , nothing to do with SI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came that he 'd be by a phone booth . " Plumm handed him a slip of paper . " Here 's the number . He 'll be there exactly at the off of the next three races . Please call him  --  he said it was urgent . What the hell was the raid for ? " " Just to frighten all the KGB aboard , to frighten them enough to flush out Sevrin . Pressure . Same as the order for Suslev and the new commissar to appear at HQ on Sunday . It was just to frighten . " " Suslev 's frightened all right . " A sardonic smile flickered over Plumm 's handsome face . " His sphincter 's out of joint for ten years at least . They 'll all have some explaining to do . When Armstrong ' happened ' to bust open the radio room , Red One operated and they dutifully and unnecessarily wrecked all their scramble and decoding equipment , along with their classified radar scanners . " Crosse shrugged . " The Ivanov 's leaving and they 've got plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or ours . We can send a report telling Center what happened . If we want . " Plumm 's eyes narrowed . " If ? " " Rosemont and his CIA thugs picked up a glass in their raid on SinclairTowers . Suslev 's prints are all over it . " Plumm went white . " Christ ! Now he 's on file ? " " Has to be . He 's in our files as you know , not as KGB , and I think I 've the only copies of his fingerprints existing . I removed them from his dossieryears ago . I 'd say it 's only a matter of time before the CIA are on to him , so the sooner he leaves Hong Kong the better . " " You think we should tell Center ? " Plumm asked uneasily . " They 'll throw their book at him for being so careless . " " We can decide over the weekend . We knew Voranski over a number of years , knew he was to be trusted . But this man ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his contact with Suslev was recent , the same as Plumm 's . " After all , is n't he only a minor KGB officer , a jumped-up courier . He 's not even Voranski 's official replacement and we 've ourselves to think of . " " True ! " Plumm hardened . " Maybe he 's a real berk . I know I was n't fol/lowed to Sinclair Towers . And as to the decoded cable  --  Cod stone the crows ! " " What ? " " The decoded cable  --  the one he dropped and Armstrong picked off the Ivanov 's deck . We 've got to decide about that . " Crosse turned away to hide his shock and fought for control , appalled that neither Armstrong nor Sinders had mentioned any cable . He pretended to stifle a yawn to cover . " Sorry , I was up most of the night , " he said , making a major effort to keep his voice matter-of-fact . " Did he tell you what was in it ? " " Of course . I insisted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he tell you was in it ? " " Oh ? You mean he might be lying ? " Plumm 's anxiety showed . " It went something like : Inform Arthur that following his request for a Priority One on the traitor Metkin an immediate intercept was ordered for Bombay . Second , the meeting with the American is brought forward to Sunday . Third and final : The AMG files continue to be Priority One . Maximumeffort must be made by Sevrin to achieve success . Center . " Plumm licked his lips . " Is it correct ? " " Yes , " Crosse said , gambling , almost wet with relief . He began weighingodds on Armstrong and Sinders . Now why , deliberately , why did n't they tell me that ? " Terrible , eh ? " Plumm said . " Yes , but not serious . " " I do n't agree , " Plumm said irritably . " It absolutely ties the KGB to Sevrin , absolutely confirms Arthur 's existence and Sevrin 's existence . " " Yes , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason , we 're quite safe . " " Are we ? There 've been too many leaks for my liking . Far too many . Perhaps we should close down for a time . " " We are closed down . It 's only those bloody AMG files that are causing us any grief . " " Yes . At least that bugger Grant was n't completely accurate . " " You mean about Banastasio ? " " Yes . I still wonder where the hell he fits in . " " Yes . " In AMG 's intercepted file Banastasio had been named erroneouslyas Sevrin 's American connection . It was only after the file that Crosse had learned from Rosemont who Banastasio actually was . " The fellow who met him was Vee Cee Ng , " Crosse said . Plumm 's eyebrows soared . " Photographer Ng ? How does he connect ? " " I do n't know . Shipping , ships , smuggling . He 's into all kinds of shady deals . " Crosse shrugged . " Could that writer fellow 's theory work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KGB be doing an op in our territory without telling us ? "  |p908  " Possible . Or it could be an utterly different department , perhaps GRU , instigated in America by the KGB or GRU there . Or just a coincidence . " Crosse was back in control now , the fright of the cable wearing off . He was thinking much clearer . " What 's Suslev want that 's so urgent ? " " Our cooperation . Koronski arrives by the afternoon plane . " Crosse whistled . " Center ? " " Yes . There was a message this morning . Now that the Ivanov 's equipmentis wrecked I 'm the go-between . " " Good . What 's his cover name ? " " Hans Meikker , West German . He 's to stay at the Seven Dragons . " Plumm 's anxiety increased . " Listen , Suslev said Center 's ordered us to prepare to snatch Ian an  --  " " They 've gone mad ! " Crosse exploded . " I agree but Suslev says it 's the only way to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if so , where they 're hidden . He claims Koronski can do it . In a chemical debriefing , well , Ian 's memory can be . . . can be emptied . " " That 's madness , " Crosse said . " We 're not even sure if the files are counterfeit . That 's a complete supposition for God 's sake ! " " Suslev says Center told him , we can blame it on the Werewolves  --  those buggers snatched John Chen so why would n't they go after the big money , the tai-pan ? " " No . Too dangerous . " Plumm wiped his hands . " To snatch Ian now 'd put the tai-pans and Hong Kong into a furor . It could be a perfect time , Roger . " " Why ? " " The Noble House would be in total disarray and with all the bank runs and the stock market disaster , Hong Kong 'd be down the sewer and that 'd send all China into shock . We 'd jump the Cause forward ten years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Christ , Roger , are n't you sick of just sitting and being a messenger ? Now we can fulfill Sevrin with hardly any risk . Then we close everything down for a time . " Crosse lit a cigarette . He had heard the tension in Plumm 's voice . " I 'll think about it , " he said at length . " Leave it for the moment . I 'll call you tonight . Did Suslev say who the American in the cable was ? " " No . He just said it was n't anything to do with us . " Crosse 's voice hardened . " Everything here 's to do with us . " " I agree . " Plumm watched him . " It could also be a code word , a code for anyone . " " Possible . " " I have a wild one for you . Banastasio . " Why him ? " Crosse asked , having jumped to the same conclusion . " I do n't know why , but I 'll bet that whole scam , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or assisted . It 's classic Sun Tzu : using the enemy'sp909strength against himself  --  both enemies , the U.S. and China . A strong unified Vietnam 's guaranteed militantly anti-Chinese . Eh ? " " Possible . Yes , it all fits , " Crosse agreed . Except one thing , he thought : Vee Cee Ng . Until Brian Kwok had blurted out , " Vee Cee 's one of us , " he had had no inkling that the man was anything other than a swinging photographer and trader-shipping capitalist . " If Banastasio 's the American , we 'll know . " He finished his cigarette . " Was there anything else ? " " No . Roger , consider Dunross . Please . The Werewolves make it pos-sible . " " It 's considered . " " This weekend would be perfect , Roger . " " I know . " Orlanda was watching the horses through her high-powered binoculars as they broke out of the starting gate for the fourth race . She stood in a corner of the members ' balcony , Bartlett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was watching her , the curve of her breasts under the silk , the angle of her cheekbones and the intensity of her excitement . " Come on , Crossfire , " she muttered , " come on ! He 's lying fifth , Linc , oh come on , you beauty , come on ... " He chuckled , Orlanda oblivious . They had arranged to meet here between the third and fourth race . " Are you a voting member ? " he had asked her last night . " Oh no , my darling , I 'm just going with friends . Old friends of my family . Another drink ? " " No , no thanks  --  I 'd better go . " They had kissed and again he had felt her overpowering welcome . It had kept him unsettled and on edge all the way back across the harbor home and most of the night . Much as he tried , he found the wanting of her difficult to contain and to keep in perspective . You 're hooked , old buddy , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching her lips , her eyes concentrating , everything forgotten but her $50 on the nose of the big gray , the favorite . " Come on . . . come . . . oh he 's moving up , Linc . . . oh he 's second . . . " Bartlett looked at the pack galloping now into the last stretch : Crossfire , the big gray well placed to Western Scot , a brown gelding who was slightly in the lead , the going very slow  --  one horse had fallen in the third race . Now a contender made his dash , Winwell Stag , a gelding belonging to Havergill that Peter Marlowe had tipped to win , and he was coming up strong on the outside with Crossfire and Western Scot neck and neck just ahead , all whips out now in the gathering roar . " Oh come on come on come on Crossfire . . . oh he 's won , he 's won ! "  |p910Bartlett  laughed in the pandemonium as Orlanda 's glee burst out and she hugged him . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another roar as the winning numbers were flashed up on the tote board , confirming their order . Now everyone waited for the final odds . Another great cheer . Crossfire paid 5 to 2 . " That 's not much , " he said . " Oh but it is it is it is ! " Orlanda had never looked prettier to him , her hat cute , much better than Casey 's  --  he 'd noticed it at once and complimentedher on it . She moved forward and leaned on the railing and looked down at the winner 's circle . " There 's the owner , Vee Cee Ng , he 's one of our Shanghainese trader-shipping millionaires . My father knew him quite well . " She gave him the glasses . Bartlett focused . The man leading the garlanded horse into the winner 's circle was expensively dressed , a beaming , well-set Chinese in his fifties . Then Bartlett recognized Havergill leading in his Winwell Stag , second , defeated by a nose . In the paddock he saw Gornt , Plumm , Pugmire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails talking to a smaller man . The governor was walking from group to group with his wife and aide . Bartlett watched them , envying them a little , the owners standing there with their caps and raincoats and shooting sticks and expensive women and girl friends , greeting one another , all members of the inner club , the powerhouse of Hong Kong , there and in the boxes above . All very British , he thought , all very clever . Will I fit in better than Biltzmann ? Sure . Unlessthey want me out as much as they wanted him out . I 'll be a voting member easy . Ian said as much . Would Orlanda fit there ? Of course . As wife or girl friend , it 's all the same . " Who 's that ? " he asked . " The man talking to Ian ? " " Oh that 's Alexi Travkin , he 's the tai-pan 's trainer . . . . " She stopped as Robert Armstrong came up to them . " Afternoon , Mr. Bartlett , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " " No , no I lost this one . May I introduce Miss Ramos , Orlanda Ramos , Superintendent Robert Armstrong , CID . " " Hello . " She smiled back at Armstrong , and he saw her immediate caution . Why are they all frightened of us , the innocent as well as the guilty ? he asked himself , when all we do is try to enforce their laws , try to protect them from villains and the ungodly . It 's because everyone breaks some law , even a little one , every day , most days , because a lot of laws are stupid  --  like our betting laws here . So everyone 's guilty , even you , pretty lady with the oh so sensual walk and oh so promising smile . For Bartlett . What crime have you committed today , to snare this poor innocent ? Sardonicallyhe smiled to himself . Not so innocent in most things . But against someone trained by Quillan Gornt ? A beautiful , hungry Eurasian girl with no place to go but down ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places ! Yes , you with your guns , money , birds like Casey and this one andp911meetings with the offal of the world like Banastasio , oh yes  --  I 'd give ten years of my life , more , because today I swear to God I loathe what I have to do , what only I can do for good old England . " Did you back the favorite too ? " she was asking . " No , no unfortunately . " " This 's her second winner , " Bartlett said proudly . " Ah , if you 're on a winning streak , who do you fancy in the fifth ? " " I 've been trying to decide , Superintendent . I 've no tips  --  it 's wide open . What 's yours ? " " Winning Billy 's tipped , I hear . I ca n't make up my mind either . Well , good luck . " Armstrong left them , heading for the betting windows . He had put 500 on the third-placed horse , covering his other bets . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , hoping to come out ahead . Most times he did . This afternoon he was a little behind , but he still had n't touched the 40,000 . In the corridor he hesitated . The Snake , Chief Inspector Donald C. C. Smyth , was turning away from one of the crowded winning windows , a roll of money in his hand . " Hello , Robert . How 're you doing ? " " So-so . You 're in the big time again ? " " I try . " The Snake bent closer . " How is everything ? " " Proceeding . " Once more Armstrong felt nauseated at the thought of more of the Red Room , then sitting there , letting Brian Kwok 's mind spill out his most secret secrets , working against the clock that was ticking away  --  all of them aware that the governor was asking London for permission to trade . " You 're not looking so good , Robert . " " I do n't feel so good . Who 's going to win the fifth ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The word is Pilot Fish . He did tip Buccaneer in the first , though with this going anything could happen . " " Yes . Anything on the Werewolves ? " " Nothing . It 's a dead end . I 'm having the whole area combed but with this rain it 's almost hopeless . I did interview Dianne Chen this morningandJohn Chen 's wife Barbara . They gave me sweet talk . I 'd lay a fiver to a bent hatpin they know more than they 're telling . I had a brief talk with Phillip Chen but he was equally uncooperative . Poor bugger 's pretty shook . " The Snake looked up at him . " By chance did Mary have any clue about John ? " Armstrong looked back at him . " I have n't had a chance to ask her . Tonight  --  if they give me any peace . " " They wo n't . " Smyth 's face crinkled with a twisted smile . " Put your 40 on Pilot Fish . " " What 40 ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown your coop  --  to mix metaphors . " The smaller man shrugged . " Do n't worry , Rob/ert , have a flutter . There 's plenty more where that came from . Good luck . " He went away . Armstrong stared after him , hating him . The bugger 's right though , he thought , his chest hurting . There 's plenty more but once you take the first , what about the second and though you give nothing , admit nothing , guarantee nothing , there will come a time . As sure as God made little apples there 's always a return payment . Mary . She needs that holiday , needs it so much and there 's the stockbroker'sbill and all the other bills and oh Christ , with this market gone crazy I 'm almost wiped out . God curse money  --  or the lack of it. 40 on a winning quinella 'd solve everything . Or do I put it all on Pilot Fish ? All or half or none . If it 's all , there 's plenty of time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the betting lines . Many recognized him and those who did , feeling their instant internal fear , wished the police had their own box and own windows and did not mix with honest citizens . Four Finger Wu was one of these . Hastily he put 50,000 on a quinella of Pilot Fish and Butterscotch Lass and fled back to the members ' room , gratefully to sip his brandy and soda . Dirty dogmeat police to frighten honest citizens , he thought , waiting for Venus Poon to return . Eeeee , he chortled , her Golden Gully 's worth every carat of the diamond I promised her last night . Two Clouds and Rain before dawn and a promise of anotherbout on Sunday when the yang recovers his juA sudden roar from outside diverted his mind . At once he shoved his way through the crowds packing the balcony . The names of the fifth racehorsesand their jockeys were coming up on the board , one by one . Pilot Fish , number one , got a full-bellied cheer ; then Street Vendor , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripple of excitement went through her many backers . When Noble Star , seven , flashed up there was a great roar and when the last , number eight , the favorite , Butterscotch Lass , there was an even greater roar . Down by the rail Dunross and Travldn were grimly inspecting the turf . It was torn and slippery . The nearer the rail , the worse it was . Above , the sky was blacker and lowering . A sprinkle started and a nervous groan slipped from fifty thousand throats . " It 's rotten , tai-pan , " Travkin said , " the going 's rotten . " " It 's the same for everyone . " Dunross let his mind reestimate the odds a last time . If I ride and win , the omen will be immense . If I ride and lose , the omen will be very bad . To be beaten by Pilot Fish would be even worse . I could be hurt easily . I ca n't afford . . . the Noble House ca n't afford to be headless today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or finishes behind Pilot Fish that would be bad but not as bad . That would be joss . But I wo n't get hurt . I 'll win . I want this race more than anything inp913the world . I wo n't fail . I 'm not sure about Alexi . I can win  --  if the gods are with me . Yes but how much are you prepared to gamble on the gods ? " Eeee , young Ian , " Old Chen-chen had told him many times , " beware of expecting help from the gods , however much you petition them with gold or promises . Gods are gods and gods go out to lunch and sleep and get bored and turn their eyes away . Gods are the same as people : good and bad , lazy and strong , sweet and sour , stupid and wise ! Why else are they gods , heya ? " Dunross could feel his heart thumping and could smell the warm , acrid , sweet-sour horse sweat , could sense the mind-blinding , spirit-curdling motioning , hands gripping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far straight , now into the last corner , the aching , grand sweet terror of speed , wielding the whip , jamming your heels in , outstretched now , carefully bumping Pilot Fish into the rails , putting him off his stride , and now into the straight , ripping into the straight , Pilot Fish behind , winning post ahead . . . come on come on . . . winning ... . " We have to decide , tai-pan . It 's time . " Dunross came back slowly , bile in his mouth . " Yes . You ride , " he said , putting the House before himself . And now that he had said it he put the rest aside and clapped Travkin warmly on the shoulders . " Win , Alexi , win by God . " The older man , gnarled and leathery , peered up at him . He nodded once , then walked off to change . As he went he noticed Suslev in the stands watching him through binoculars . A tremor went through him . Suslev had promised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be allowed to join him in Hong Kong  --  and stay in Hong Kong  --  at Christmas . If he cooperated . If he cooperated and did what was asked . Do you believe that ? No . No , not at all , those matyeryebyets are liars and betrayers but maybe this time ... Christ Jesus why should I be ordered to meet Dunross at Sinclair Towers by night , late at night ? Why ? Christ Jesus , what should I do ? Do n't think , old man . You 're old and soon you 'll be dead but your first duty is to win . If you win , the tai-pan will do your bidding . If you lose ? If you win or lose , how can you live with the shame of betraying the man who befriended you and trusts you ? He went into the jockeys ' room . Behind him Dunross had turned to glance at the tote . The odds had shortened , the total amount at risk already two and a half million . ButterscotchLass was 3 to I , Noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilot Fish 5 to i , Golden Lady 7 to I. Early yet , he thought , and so much time left to gamble . Travkin will shorten the odds . A cold shaft took him . I wonder if there 's a deal going on right now , a deal among the trainers and jockeys ? Christ , we all better be watching this one very carefully indeed . " Ah Ian ! " " Oh hello , sir . " Dunross smiled at Sir Geoffrey who came up to himp914then looked at Havergill who was with the governor . " Pity about WinwellStag , Paul , I thought he ran a grand race . " " Joss , " Havergill said politely . " Who 's riding Noble Star ? " " Travkin . " The governor 's face lit up . " Ah , very good choice . Yes , he 'll make a good race of it . For a moment , Ian , I was afraid you might be tempted . " " I was . Still am , sir . " Dunross smiled faintly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , I 'm riding her . " " Well , for the sake of all of us and the Noble House , let 's hope that does n't happen . We ca n't afford to have you hurt . The going looks terrible . " Another swirl of rain came and passed by . " We 've been very lucky so far . No bad accidents . If the rain starts in earnest , it might be worthwhileconsidering abandoning . " " We 've already discussed it , sir . We 're running a little late . The race 'll be delayed ten minutes . So long as the weather holds for this race most people will be satisfied . " Sir Geoffrey watched him . " Oh by the way , Ian , I tried the minister a few minutes ago but I 'm afraid he was already in meetings . I left word and he 'll call back the moment he can . It seems the ramifications of this damned Profumo scandal are once more tearing at the very roots of the Conservative government . The press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been breaches of security . Until the Commission of Enquiry comes out next month , settling once and for all security aspects and rumorsthat others in the government are implicated or not , there 'll be no peace . " " Yes , " Havergill said . " But surely the worst 's over , sir . As to the report , certainly it wo n't be adverse . " " Adverse or not , this scandal will wreck the Conservatives , " Dunross said soberly , remembering AMG 's forecast in the last report . " Good God , I hope not . " Havergill was aghast . " Those two twits , Grey and Broadhurst , in power amongst all the other Socialist shower ? If their press conference was any indication , we might as well all go home . " ' We are home , and it all comes home to roost . Eventually , " Sir Geoffrey said sadly . " Anyway , Ian made the correct decision , not to ride . " He glanced at Havergill and his gaze sharpened . " As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be a very poor show if the HoPak'sdepositors were wiped out , perhaps just because of poor judgment by Richard Kwang and the lack of a benevolent decision by those who could avoid such a disaster if they wished  --  perhaps to great profit . Eh ? " " Yes sir . " Sir Geoffrey nodded and left them . Dunross said , " What was that about ? " " The governor thinks we should rescue the Ho-Pak , " Havergill said offhandedly . " Why do n't you ?  |p915  " Let 's talk about the General Stores takeover . " " First let 's finish the Ho-Pak . The governor 's right , it would benefit all of us , Hong Kong  --  and the bank . " " You 'd be in favor ? " " Yes , of course . " " You 'll approve , you and your block will approve making the takeover ? " " I do n't have a block but certainly I 'll support a reasonable takeover . " Paul Havergill smiled thinly . " I was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dunross whistled . " That 's not much . " " By Monday night he 'll have zero . He 'll probably settle for that  --  his holdings would give the bank control . We could easily stand surety for zoo percent of his depositors . " " He 's got that amount of securities ? " " No , but with the normalization of the market and our judicious management , over a year or two it 's true the acquisition of the Ho-Pak could greatly benefit us . Oh yes . And there 's a desperate need to restore confidence . Such a takeover would help immeasurably . " " This afternoon would be a perfect announcement time . " " I agree . Anything on Tiptop ? " Dunross studied him . " Why the sudden change around , Paul ? And why discuss it with me ? " " There 's no change around . I 've considered the Ho-Pak very carefully . The acquisition would be good bank policy . " Havergill watched him . " We 'll give him face and offer him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors about the Big Bank are true ? " " Not to my knowledge , " the banker said coldly . " As to why discuss it with you ? Because you 're a director of the bank , presently the most importantone , with substantial influence on the board . That 's a sensible thing to do , is n't it ? " " Yes , but . " Havergill 's eyes became colder . " The interests of the bank have nothing to do with my distaste for you , or your methods . But you were right about Superfoods . You made a good offer at a perfect time and sent a wave of confidence soaring through everyone here . It 's bound to spread over all Hong Kong . It was brilliant timing and now if we follow it up and announcewe 've assumed all the Ho-Pak responsibilities to its depositors , that 's another immense vote of confidence . All we need to do is get back confidence . If Tiptop comes to our assistance with his cash , Monday is boom day for Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we buy Struan 's heavily . By Monday evening we 'll assume control . However I 'll make you a deal right now : we 'll put up the 2 million for General Foods in return for half your bank stock . " " No thanks . " ' We 'll have it all by next weekend . We 'll guarantee that 2 million
