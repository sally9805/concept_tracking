For 22 years Sir Rudolf Bing ran a great opera house as if it were his own home . Of sharp tongue and sharper mind , Sir Rudolf tended to every detail at New York City 's Metropolitan Opera  --  planning the season 's repertoire , hiring ( and firing ) conductors , checking the seamstresses as they worked on costumes . And the divas ! Bing did not suffer singers gladly , and prided ) himself on his ability to control prima donnas , cajoling Montserrat Caballe or flaying Maria Callas with equally imperious vigor . In the years immediately following his retirement as general manager in 1972 , Bing could still be spotted around town , often dressed in white tie and tails and always in the best company . <P> Sir Rudolf Bing was spotted in the Caribbean last week , but this time occasionally mumbling " What day is it ? " and in the company of a woman with a troubled past . His mind enfeebled by Alzheimer 's disease , Bing , now 85 , has been living for the past week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Carroll Douglass , fortyish , whom he met last year . If she is to be believed , the two are " totally in love " and on their honeymoon ; if Bing 's court-appointed protectors are to be believed , Bing , a widower and childless , is being victimized by a mentally confused woman . Whatever the legal resolution may be , the beach tableau of this forlorn couple in their palm- fringed haven , with meager funds and not many friends , seemed ineffably sad . <P> Sometimes Douglass claims Bing introduced himself to her at a Met performance of Parsifal ; at other times she says they met in the lobby of his Manhattan apartment building . Bing , whose mental acuity apparently started to decline seriously after his wife of 54 years died in 1983 , began writing checks to Douglass . The spending caught the eye of Lawyer Paul Guth , a longtime associate whom Bing once designated to be in charge of his personal affairs in the event he became incapacitated . Concerned , Guth filed a petition to declare Bing incompetent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's estimated assets of $900,000 were frozen . <P> By this time the couple had slipped out of New York and married in Virginia . The new Lady Bing , as she calls herself , fled with her husband by Trailways bus to Florida , then headed to Anguilla . There , questioned by reporters last week , she gave her life story , but the versions began to multiply . Had she been married before ? No . Well , in fact it turned out she had been , twice . Second Husband William Rickenbacker , investment counselor and son of World War I Flying Ace Eddie Rickenbacker , told the New York Daily News that she was " quite mad . " <P> He is not alone in thinking her mentally disturbed . In 1982 a District of Columbia judge appointed Douglass 's brother and sister conservators of her affairs on the ground that , among other things , she " had acquired a romantic and unreasonable fixation for the person of the Pope . " According to court documents , she once tried to become the Pontiff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
