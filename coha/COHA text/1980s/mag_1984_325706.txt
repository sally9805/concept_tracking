An election hinges on death squads , land reform and gringos <P> His way cleared by eight bodyguards , Salvadoran Constitutional Assembly President Roberto d'Aubuisson struck an aggressive pose last week as he approached a specially erected platform in the remote Salvadoran farming cooperative of Parra Lempa . D'Aubuisson wore white and a .38-cal. revolver , an emblem by which he is familiarly known . " Some people write that we are barbarians and bloody , " he shouted to an audience of some 400 campesinos . " But today , you have seen that we stand for land reform . In return for your vote , we Nationalist Republicans promise to work for the people . " The crowd cheered , and for good reasons . Just after his speech , D'Aubuisson presented the agricultural workers with formal title to the lands they had farmed for years as propertyless tenants . <P> D'Aubuisson 's populist rhetoric contrasted sharply with his reputation as a right-wing extremist . The boyish-looking onetime Salvadoran police major , now 40 , has consistently tried to delay implementation of U.S.-sponsored efforts at land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused an entry visa to the U.S. , a rebuff linked to his alleged ties to the country 's nefarious right-wing death squads . For the present , however , he wishes to appear a man of the people , and is running hard in a long-awaited presidential-election campaign that is crucial both to his country 's future and to the foreign policy aims of the Reagan Administration . <P> With only two months remaining until the March 25 elections , campaign fever is high in El Salvador , despite the continuing violence of the government 's war against some 10,000 members of the <P> Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( F.M.L.N. ) . Along the highway leading out of the capital of San Salvador , trees are beribboned with the red-white-and-blue emblems of D'Aubuisson 's Nationalist Republican Alliance , known by its Spanish acronym of ARENA . Sidewalk intersections are spray-painted with the green fish symbol of ARENA 'S chief rival in the eight-party presidential race , the centrist Christian Democrats led by Jose Napoleon Duarte . On El Salvador 's four television channels , political advertisements exhort voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . <P> The differences between the two chief rivals for the presidency are pronounced and profound . At his own campaign rallies around the country , the Christian Democrats ' Duarte stresses conciliation and optimism as the answer to El Salvador 's bloody woes . If elected , Duarte promises to speed up the progress of Salvadoran land reform and begin negotiations that would bring members of the F.M.L.N . insurgency within the legitimate political process . Duarte has also vowed to rid El Salvador of human rights violations , which are among the worst in the hemisphere . He proposes to eliminate the country 's 2,500-member Treasury Police , the ill-trained and thuggish force that is believed to serve as a major reservoir of talent for the murderous death squads , who have added thousands to the estimated toll of 40,000 Salvadoran civilians killed since 1979.
