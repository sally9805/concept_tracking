Blacks and a chicano are blockbusters in white rock ' n ' roll <P> The trouble started , intones the singer , when he noticed " Too many faces that are/ Not just like mine . " Around the corner . Down the block . Next door . Think what their front yards will look like . Imagine the kind of music they will play . You can understand the singer 's feelings when he stubbornly insists : " I ai n't moving out for no Carol and Bob/ The inner city is too close to my job . " You may admire the vehemence of his stand even as you sense its moral blindness and recognize its hopelessness , just as the singer does when he moans , " There goes the neighborhood/ The whites are moving in . " <P> This stinging , slap-happy cartoon of contemporary race relations is one of the standout tunes on one of the year 's standout albums , Minimum Wage Rock &; Roll , by a brash new Los Angeles band called , with appropriate bemusement , the Bus Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicano drummer , its excursions through the realms of brotherhood come as naturally as a walk around the block , and are sometimes just as risky . KKK announces a fearless ambition guaranteed to turn both sides of the color line to a common , angry red : " I am bigger than a nigger/ Wan na be an all American man/ Wan na join the Ku Klux Klan/ Play in a rock ' n ' roll band . " Wielding lyrics that take wide swipes at the collective social conscience , the Bus Boys are a much needed addition to the contemporary rock music scene , which goes light on social issues and white on rhythm . There goes the neighborhood , indeed ; and a good thing too . <P> Keyboard Player Brian O'Neal , 24 , and his bassist brother Kevin , 19 , who wrote Minimum Wage 's eleven songs and swap most of the lead vocals , share a gift for flipping stereotypes into comic contortions . Kevin 's Respect is part Rodney Dangerfield , part Aretha Franklin . Brian 's Johnny Soul 'd Out is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of music he wants , not what is expected of him ( " Johnny soul 'd out . . . / He 's into rock ' n ' roll and he 's given up the rhythm blues " ) . <P> The Bus Boys ' lyrics and their seismic live shows , which feature goofy choreography and express-train velocity , are reminiscent of the Coasters , the great clown princes of ' 50s R &; R. Their music , however , owes more to the hipster rhythms of Sly Stone and the blistering aggression of the punks . " People assume the way a black group would go is rhythm and blues , " Kevin O'Neal reflects . " But rock ' n ' roll has more avenues and more freedom . It is about rebellion and change . " Adds Brian : " In one sense , our album acknowledges the white influence on black music . " <P> The Bus Boys may not see the big bucks for a while . Although the album is selling well enough , it is not a huge commercial hit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere near the Top 40 . Stevie Wonder assured the Bus Boys of his enthusiasm but warned that other blacks might not share the sentiment . " I 'm not worried about blacks liking this , " Brian insists . " And I 'm not worried about whom we offend . Most themes for black contemporary music are party-love-dance . I think we will hit black audiences hard . "
