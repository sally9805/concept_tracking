Paul Taylor burst upon the dance world in 1957 , but not quite in the way he had hoped . At 27 he was a member of Martha Graham 's troupe and already experimenting on his own . Specifically he was trying to strip away the " dancerly " elements in the modern style , to get down to the basics . He and his hardworking group of three performed the results at the YM-YWHA in Manhattan , and a few weeks later Louis Horst in the influential Dance Observer weighed in with the definitive review : four inches of blank space followed by the author 's initials . <P> Thirty years later the master choreographer still glowers in behalf of the novice he once was : " The review was n't even very long , " he fumes . But the showman in Taylor is able to put it in perspective . " There is , " he remembers , " what no amount of paid advertising could have brought  --  immediate notoriety . " The two coexisting reactions  --  of the egocentric artist and the canny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Private Domain Taylor has written one of the best and most candid theater books to appear in a long time . <P> There have been several dance autobiographies recently , many of them extolling or punishing George Balanchine along the way , but none is as intelligent or funny or shrewd as this one . Taylor 's insights on fellow artists  --  Graham , Balanchine , Robert Rauschenberg  --  are unusually trenchant and fresh . The book is blessedly free of the cleaned-up quality that such memoirs often have , which inevitably makes the childhood chapters the only interesting , trustworthy ones . Talk about warts and all ! For readers who want to hear about pressures and strains on the professional dancer  --  the drugs , the drink , the penury  --  they are all here , far more eloquently stated than in the lurid confessions of Gelsey Kirkland 's Dancing on My Grave . <P> Today Taylor is probably America 's greatest living choreographer . He has received most of the major awards , including a MacArthur " genius grant . " He has a town house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforts came decades of very hard scrambling . He was born near Pittsburgh in the depths of the Depression , and his parents separated when he was a small boy . Mama was too busy managing hotel dining rooms to spend much time with her son . Still , he recalls , " I do n't remember ever being lonely  --  I had health , privacy , and a mother I was wild about . " Early on he recognized the " beautiful curse " of solitude , " the one without which I doubt all other patterns would have grown . " <P> Taylor discovered his vocation while at Syracuse on a swimming scholarship . It came as an inexplicable flash , " telling me that I 'm to become a dancer  --  not any old dancer , but one of the best . " The flash was tardy ; college is dangerously late to start serious dance training . But Taylor worked on technique , pushing his " instrument "  --  as modern dancers like to call their bodies  --  ruthlessly , and he was soon studying with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful influence . Much to Taylor 's approval , she called her instrument the " bodaah , " and he was transfixed by her witchy pronouncements and " oracular eyes . "
