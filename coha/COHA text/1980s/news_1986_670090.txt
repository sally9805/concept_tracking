First Boston Corp. said it plans to sell $3. 2 billion of securities backed by General Motors Corp. low-interest car loans , the largest underwritten offering ever in the U.S. capital markets . The offering would be the second-largest internationally and is the first to apply a structure that revolutionized the mortgage-backed bond market to bonds backed by other types of assets . The idea , which may be widely copied , would add a new level of sophistication to the rapidly growing asset-backed securities market , allowing issuers to tailor offerings more specifically to a wider range of investors . The bonds , which First Boston calls asset-backed obligations , are modeled on collateralized mortgage obligations . Rather than simply passing principal and interest payments through to bondholders , as previous asset-backed offerings have done , First Boston ' s offering splits that cash flow into three separate securities with different maturities . All three get interest payments , but principal payments are made in sequence , first to the shortest-term security , then to the intermediate one , and finally to the long one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average life slightly over one year , $460 million of bonds with a 2. 2-year average life , and $1. 025 billion of three-year-plus bonds . The securities , which are expected to get triple-A ratings from both Standard &; Poor ' s Corp. and Moody ' s Investors Service Inc. , are being issued by a special-purpose subsidiary of First Boston . The subsidiary bought the loans from General Motors Acceptance Corp . , GM ' s lending arm . While GMAC has promised to buy back as much as 5% of non-performing loans in the pool  --  a promise backed by a letter of credit from Credit Suisse  --  investors can essentially look only to the loans for repayment . They don ' t have any recourse to First Boston or to GMAC . First Boston is able to offer the securities at market interest rates even though the loans carry below-market rates , because the firm bought them from GMAC at a discount . The face value of the loans is actually $3. 4 billion . About 60% of the pool is 2. 9% loans and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priced and offered next week . In addition , First Boston is trying to take advantage of a positively sloping yield curve , where longer-term rates are higher than shorter-term rates . The bulk of the offering is the one-year portion , where rates are lowest . By pushing as much as possible of the pool into that short-term piece , First Boston lowers its overall rate . Unlike earlier asset-backed securities , First Boston ' s offering has a set payment schedule . Ordinarily , since car loans , like mortgages , can be paid at any time , investors risk getting their principal back sooner than they expect . On this offering , First Boston is assuming that risk . The firm ' s studies have shown that car loans prepay at a much more consistent level than mortgages , First Boston officials say . In addition , consumers are generally less likely to prepay below-market loans . The issue is arousing an extraordinary amount of interest , investment bankers said . Anthony V. Dub , a managing director at First Boston , said , " It ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although First Boston plans to issue more asset-backed obligations , he added , the fixed-payment feature , which investment bankers say should be especially attractive to investors , works best with below-market loans and might be hard to duplicate . " There ' s a good chance this could be a one-of-a-kind deal , " Mr. Dub said . The largest offering ever made was a $4 billion Eurobond offering for the United Kingdom last month .
