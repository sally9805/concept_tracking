Japan has long been renowned for its procession of bestselling products : cars and cameras , radios and record players , steel and semiconductors . In the future it will also be an important source of a more basic commodity : money . As Japan 's trade surplus mushrooms , the country is raking in much more money than it spends at home . As a result , the Japanese are sending the funds back overseas by making loans , buying foreign stocks and bonds , and building factories in countries around the globe . Once merely a master manufacturer , Japan is on the way to becoming the world 's premier investor and creditor . Its economic and financial clout could eventually rival the power held by Britain in the 19th century and the U.S. after World War II . <P> In 1984 , Japan ran a trade surplus of about $44 billion , up from $20 billion in 1981 . In trade with the U.S. alone last year , Japan had a $30 billion surplus . One reason for that startling imbalance is the lofty value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates , the dollar has risen 30% against the yen since 1978 . That has made Japanese imports cheaper for U.S. shoppers , and American exports more expensive in Japan . Economists think the dollar may decline a bit over the next year or two , but not nearly enough to erase Japan 's surplus . In fact , some Japanese trade experts predict that their country 's favorable balance of trade with the U.S. could balloon to $75 billion by 1990 . <P> Japanese holdings overseas are now worth about $70 billion more than the investments that foreigners have made in Japan . That total should reach $100 billion this year , moving Japan past the U.S. ( $95 billion ) and Britain ( $81 billion ) into the top spot among international investors . Nobumitsu Kagami , chief economist of Nomura Investment Management in Tokyo , projects that Japan 's overseas investment surplus will rise to $500 billion by 1992 . Says Hiroshi Takeuchi , a managing director of Japan 's Long-Term Credit Bank : " Our country could become a permanent capital exporter . " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep American interest rates , Japanese investors poured about $25 billion last year into U.S. Government securities . That windfall financed a sizable chunk of the $175 billion federal budget deficit . Without Japanese money , interest rates on Treasury securities , which now range to 11.66% on a 30-year bond , would be even higher . <P> Japan also exports capital in the form of loans and grants to its neighbors in the Pacific region . The Philippines , staggering under a $26 billion foreign debt and deep in recession , received a grant of about $240 million from the Japanese government three months ago . Last July the Japanese government gave Thailand loans and grants worth about $300 million . Japan hopes that economic aid will strengthen its neighbors and increase trade and prosperity throughout the whole Pacific region .
