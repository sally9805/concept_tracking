Officially , China is a champion of black-African interests . The government has denounced South Africa 's policy of apartheid and devoted the lion 's share of its scanty foreign aid to assisting 45 friendly African states . Beijing also gives scholarships to 1,600 black students each year to study at Chinese universities . Unofficially , though , many Chinese consider blacks racially inferior and question their government 's aid to Africa when citizens at home are tightening their belts . <P> Last week those resentments flared into a weeklong upheaval involving some 5,000 demonstrators in the eastern city of Nanjing . The turmoil began on Christmas Eve , when a fracas broke out between a small group of African students and a security guard at the gate of Hehai University , which has the most black students of any Nanjing campus . According to official accounts , which were contested by foreign students , the Africans refused to register the names of their Chinese dates at a party . Chinese students heard a false report that the foreigners had killed the security guard and rampaged through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture . At least 13 people were injured in the melee . The Chinese then went on a hunt for the black students , filling the streets and shouting , " Beat the black devils ! " <P> On Christmas Day , 70 Africans sought  --  and got  --  police escorts to the Nanjing train station so they could file complaints with their respective embassies in Beijing . As they marched through the streets , the Africans rallied foreign students from campuses of other universities along the way . At the station , riot troops herded roughly 150 foreign students , including four Americans , onto buses and confined them in a hotel 50 miles away . At week 's end they were being held incommunicado while diplomats negotiated with Beijing officials for their release . Meantime , some demonstrators demanded that provincial-government leaders " punish the ruffians to promote the country 's honor , " while other Chinese students marched on the railway station , not knowing the foreigners had already been taken away . <P> Racial trouble has been brewing at Hehai since last November , when the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly to " protect " the foreigners and their possessions from theft by jealous Chinese students . The Africans objected in a letter to university officials , denying any need for protection . Then they tore down the wall . The Chinese deducted the cost of the damages from the $75 state stipends that the black students collect each month . In reply , 54 African students occupied the campus bank that handled the penalty transaction , dispersing only after the university president promised full reimbursement . <P> Late in the week the mass protests showed some signs of subsiding . Officials denied the incidents had anything to do with racial discrimination , but the scars from the confrontation could prove to be lasting . " I 'm actually glad I saw this side of China before I go , " said Elizabeth Morrison , one of four American students released from the hotel in response to U.S. pressure . " Otherwise I would have left with a completely different impression of the country . "                @ @ @ @ @
