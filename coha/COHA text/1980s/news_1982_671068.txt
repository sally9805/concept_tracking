This is a comprehensive encapsulation of the world of Greek tragedy , history and myth , and an opportunity for Mark Lamos and his co-director , Mary B. Robinson , to disclose their conceptual ingenuity. // The John Barton-Kenneth Cavander adaptation was first staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1980 . In a severely cut version , " The Greeks " was presented last summer at the Williamstown Theater Festival with an all-star cast. // At the Stage Company , the script is restored to almost its full length , omitting only Euripides ' s " Andromache " from the Shakespeare company version . While one is aware of omissions and distortions in reducing the works to manageable playing proportions - and also the shortcomings of some of the Hartford performances - there is no denying the ambitiousness of the event. // " The Greeks " compensates in clarity for what it loses in density . One major criticism of the cycle is that it is simply not long enough . It is a chronological collage that condenses six plays by Euripides , one each by Aeschylus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Iliad " ( the least successful of the sections ) . Each play is introduced and linked to the others , with the text of each pared to an average of 45 minutes. // Naturally the result is something of a hybrid of styles . There is , however , a dramatic arc to the trilogy , divided into The War , The Murders and The Gods , sweeping from the sacrifice of " Iphigenia in Aulis " all the way to the restitution of " Iphigenia in Tauris. " // By the end of the trilogy , we have lived through several explosive decades of Greek history and have observed a complex emotional canvas . Major figures such as Agamemnon , Menelaus and Clytemnestra are studied in depth at various junctures . Clytemnestra , for example , is seen not only as the monster of " Electra " but also as the deceived mother of " Iphigenia " and the humiliated wife of " Agamemnon. " // Although theatergoers are invited to see individual sections of the cycle , for the greatest effectiveness , it is advisable to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motifs , refrains of regret and humanizing contradictions of character - the waste of youth , the sufferings of women , the shifts of guilt to the gods. // After the second part , I overheard two women in the audience comparing their catharses with some degree of disappointment . They should have waited until the end of the long evening , and the reuniting of Iphigenia and Orestes . We first saw the two of them almost 11 hours earlier , Iphigenia as a sacrifice to the gods and Orestes as an infant in the arms of Clytemnestra . Embracing , the two siblings bond together in a tearful and purgative proclamation of hope and conciliation. // The cycle takes us from the siege of Troy through the horrors in the house of Atreus , telescoping action so that events tumble after one another in a kind of domino effect . Everything affects something else ; nothing happens in isolation. // On one level , this is the liveliest and the most lucid performance of Greek tragedy one has seen , although some poetry has been sacrificed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which adds to the briskness of performance and also the work ' s adaptability to an American company. // Wisely , the co-directors have individualized the speakers in the chorus . Nothing is intoned . The chorus is entirely composed of women , emphasizing the fact that we are seeing ancient Greece from the female point of view . It is the women who are brave , selfsacrificing and godlike and the men who are deceitful , hypocritical and cowardly . The chorus becomes a unified voice protesting male domination. // The two directors , the set designer , John Conklin , and the lighting designer , Pat Collins , are a creative ensemble . Mr. Conklin has backed the broad open stage with a long stonelike wall that serves as the gates of Troy , a sea bulwark and an entrance to a palace . Through artful lighting , the scene changes its complexion. // Stage pictures add immeasurably to the impact of the event : the captive Trojan women huddled behind barbed wire awaiting slavery ; the chorus lurking in deep shade outside Agamemnon ' s house like watchful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light leaping out of an open door and impaling an act of matricide. // There are 27 actors in the Hartford cast , many of them doubling in roles , an admixture of experienced professionals and neophytes . The trilogy stretches , and , in some instances , strains , the actors. // Alan Mixon is a stalwart but less than commanding Agamemnon . Jennifer Harmon turns Electra into an overwrought vixen . Others are simply overworked . However , Richard Council and Robert Jason increase in stature , and there are a number of outstanding performances harnessed toward a single goal - Mary Layne as the two faces of Iphigenia ( saintly in Aulis , demonic in Tauris ) , Jean Smart lending a womanliness to her roles as Clytemnestra and Helen , and Kevin Conroy as a furious Orestes. // The inspiration of the cast is Margaret Phillips . Deceptively slight of stature , this powerful and mature actress , too rarely seen on the stage , enrobes Hecuba with her velvet voice and assertive presence . She becomes the heart and conscience of " The Greeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the chorus. // With his Hartford productions of " Undiscovered Country , " " Cymbeline " and " Kean , " Mr. Lamos demonstrated his dauntlessness and his ability to realize drama on a grand scale . " The Greek " is a challenging adventure - for theatergoers as well as the Hartford Stage Company . <> <> The Cast <> THE GREEKS , nine plays presented as a trilogy ; adapted by John Barton and Kenneth Cavander , original translation by Mr. Cavander ; directed by Mark Lamos and Mary B.
