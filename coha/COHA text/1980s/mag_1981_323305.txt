Soft-selling on cable TV <P> It seemed to lumber ponderously down the runway for years , but now cable television is definitely airborne . A quarter of the nation 's 77.8 million TV homes are hooked up to one of the 4,600 local cable companies that pipe into living rooms everything from first-run movies , hard-sell religion and soft-core porn shows to kiddie programs and the proceedings of Congress live . Cable-systems owners , present or prospective , are as hot on Wall Street as genetic engineering firms , and advertisers are beginning to eye cable TV as a promising vehicle for commercials . Though at present a mere $45 million in cable-television revenue comes from advertising , in contrast with more than $11 billion for over-the-air television networks and stations , that amount is expected to leap to $1.5 billion by the end of the decade . Says Carl Ally , chairman of the Ally &; Gargano ad agency in New York City : " While the big three networks are chewing at each other , cable and other technologies will eat at them from the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a more specialized audience at a fraction of the cost of time on regular shows . A 30-second ad on one of the three dozen or more national networks that have grown up to service local cable channels costs only about $500 , while the three major networks charge an average of $70,000 in prime time . And since cable TV can easily provide viewers with programs on 100 or more channels that carry only sports , for example , an advertiser can make a longer pitch on a single subject . <P> Cable TV ads are , so far , usually just the same frenetic 30-second spots seen on the mainline channels . Cable News Network , Ted Turner 's 24-hour all-news channel from Atlanta , carries the standard commercials for Quaker Oats , Holiday Inns and others . <P> Leading advertisers , though , are testing a totally new type of commercial , or " informercial " as they call them , that will soon be used widely on cable television . These will range in length from 30 minutes to four hours . Sears , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain how to redecorate a porch , with Sears paint and Craftsman tools , of course . Ads comparing brand-name products , extolling the merits of one over the other , could be dealt with in laborious detail . Says Michael Dann , senior program adviser to ABC 's Video Enterprises : " The advertiser who wants to spell out the differences between Phillips ' Milk Of Magnesia and Pepto-Bismol is going to get a hell of a lot more time to do it . " <P> Some informercials are already being carried on the Home Shopping Show by the Modern Satellite Network . The weekly half-hour program , which reaches 3.8 million households in every state , consists of nonstop commercials in a talk show format . Advertisers normally buy nine minutes of air time to discuss their product or explain how it works . This week Revlon will tape its first informercial , which demonstrates how to give its Realistic Instant Styling permanents at home . Other advertisers on the show include Pillsbury , Mr. Coffee and Encyclopaedia Britannica . <P> A public long accustomed to ads on regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A survey by the New York ad agency Benton &; Bowles showed that almost half of those who do not now have pay cable television said they would gladly hook up , when the system is offered , even if it carried ads.
