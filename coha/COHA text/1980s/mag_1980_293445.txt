A DAY IN HOLLYWOOD/ A NIGHT IN THE UKRAINE <P> Book and Lyrics by Dick Vosburgh <P> Music by Frank Lazarus <P> Directed and Choreographed by <P> Tommy Tune <P> One can almost hear Louella Parsons saying , " Hello to all of you from Haw-ley-wood . " This saucy , stylish , frolicsomely funny show is an affectionate spoof of the golden age of the silver screen . <P> Act I is a takeoff on 1930s movie musicals . Using Grauman 's Chinese Theater as aspic , it captures the clichs , the formulas , the juicily idiotic emotional punch lines of the period . Singing with slyly ironic comic abandon , Jeanette MacDonald ( Peggy Hewett ) fondles a life-size cardboard cutout of Nelson Eddy , never the most mobile of performers . <P> The show-stopper of A Day in Hollywood is a dance number called " Famous Feet . " Tommy Tune , who brings an irrepressible humor to his choreography as well as dauntless invention , has devised a narrow , mirror-backed bridge span of a stage high above the stage proper . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Albert Stephenson ) are visible . By their styles and their shoes , ye shall know them . Some feet ! Fred and Ginger , naturally , as well as Garland , Chaplin , Dietrich and , believe it , Mickey and Minnie . <P> In A Night in the Ukraine , Groucho lives . So do Chico , Harpo and that lady of the formidable embonpont , Margaret Dumont . The program note says that this exercise in dementia is " loosely based on Chekhov 's The Bear . " Groucho ( David Garrison ) is the shysterish Samovar the Lawyer . Chico ( Frank Lazarus ) is a larcenous tongue-in-cheeky footman to the imperious Mrs. Pavlenko ( Hewett ) , the Dumont role . Perfectly at ease as Harpo , Priscilla Lopez is a creature from another planet , who at one wonderfully zany moment plucks out the inevitable harp solo on the spokes of an upside-down bicycle . <P> Every type of cherished ploy from the classic Marx canon is here , the inane non sequiturs , the sappy puns and the bedlam chases , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollhouse of a set . Dick Vosburgh splices his own lines into the action as if he had collaborated on the films . To use a song title from the show : Hooray for Hollywood .
