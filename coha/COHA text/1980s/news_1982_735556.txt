txt A New Jersey brokerage firm has quit making a market in over-thecounter stocks because of its failure to meet industry net-capital requirements . R.E . Bolton &; Co. , Jersey City , last week notified the Securities and Exchange Commission of the problem . Richard Bolton , the firm 's president , declined to be more specific about the nature of the violation or explain how it occurred . But he said he intended to " make the capital base right " by raising additional money " quickly . " Mr. Bolton said he did n't know whether he would resume making a market in over-the-counter securities . " The SEC is still in here poring over the books , " he said late last week . " The SEC auditors have agreed with our calculations " about net-capital violation . Security-industry rules require brokerage houses to maintain a minimum amount of capital to trade securities . John Pinto , senior vice president , surveillance , for the National Association of Securities Dealers said " you can conclude at this point that Bolton is n't making markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-the-counter securities . " We 're looking at the capital of the firm . " Mr. Pinto noted that " there are other market-makers " to handle the securities traded by the Jersey City firm . The problem first became public when two companies last week announced that Mr. Bolton 's company had stopped making a market in their shares . In the over-thecounter market , a securities dealer will provide bid and asked prices for securities in which it makes a market ; the market is competitive and a buyer or seller will seek the most attractive price . Two companies said the price of their company 's shares had been affected by Bolton 's problems . " The price plummeted , dropped like a rock , " said William R. Jernigan , vice president , finance , of Petrosystems International Inc. , Nashville . The situation " caused quite a bit of panic in our stock . " He said the stock , which went public in November 1981 , hit a record low of $2.50 last week due to Bolton 's troubles . On Thursday , it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Petrosystems , said that despite the confusion the company is " minding our own business . We 're on the same game plan . " Ralph Wienshienk , chairman of Resort &; Urban Timeshares Inc. , New York , said " we 're seeking additional firms ( to make a market ) so we do n't have a problem anymore . " Last week , Resort &; Urban had attributed a " significant drop " in its share price to the Bolton situation . On Wednesday , the stock was bid about $4.50 a share after trading about $10.75 a share earlier in the week . Mr. Bolton said his firm had been making a market in several other stocks including Patient Technology . Industrial Electronic , Nord Resources Corp. , Chronar Corp. , Biotech Research Laboratories Inc. and Private Screenings Inc.
