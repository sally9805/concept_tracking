S T 0 R Y THE HILLS AND THE CREEKS ( ALBANY , 1850 ) By William Kennedy Iwas bewildered . Nothing in my fourteen-year-old brain seemed to conclude . I was in the midst of a whirlwind panorama of violence and mystery , of tragedy and divine frenzy that mocked every effort at coherence . My family had been swept away by the cholera in the summer of ' 47 , and I had gone to stay with Emmett Daugherty , my father 's great friend , I lived out the summer and winter there at Emmett 's house beside the canal , and I cried a good deal over my sister and my lost parents . I also stopped going to church . I did n't know what to make of things , but I knew I had to do something for myself and that I had no more time to be a child . And so in the spring of ' 48 , when Emmett heard that a canaler named Masterson needed a helper , I asked for a job and got it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst months of my life . He beat me like a mutt and refused to pay me wages . I ran off when I saw how to get away clean , and found work on the skiff of John the Brawn , and together we worked the river out of Albany as ferrymen and haulers , water rats who 'd go anywhere with anything between Albany , Troy , West Troy , and Greenbush . Then , on a late day in December 1849 , a day of hellfire and flood , ice and lunacy  --  the very day that flying sparks ignited the bonnet of Bridie Conroy , sending her on a crazed run and tumble into a shed full of hay , thus igniting what history would call The Great Fire  --  on this day , I say , I saved a child from drowning William Kennedy is the author of lronweed . His new novel , Quinn 's Book , will be published in May by Viking . when a boat capsized in the Hudson 's icy waters .

Our deeds were described as heroic in the pages of the Albany Chronicle , a sheet of considerable power and political brash , founded and edited by Will Canaday , the man who would become my mentor in journalism and language . But it was Maud who directed us to our haven on the night of high tragedy . The haven I speak of was the grandest mansion in Albany , the home of Hillegond Staats , widow of Petrus Staats , whose family came to the New World from the Netherlands in 1638 , and who , before dying the richest man in Albany , had joined the Yankee Lyman Fitzgibbon in establishing an ironworks and foundry , a place of high significance to the story at hand . The Staats family embraced my life , on that icy night , in the person of the great Hillegond , and thereafter I was enveloped by Staats power , which was very old power , and reeked of money and leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of madmen , dead whores , and children of the wild river . " Come in , come in , my frozen dear , " the great crone had said to me as I entered into the grand entrance hall , dwarfed by the unknown , which billowed crazily through the mansion like the lovely heat that was already warming my soul . Her words beyond that I can not precisely recall , for the degree of their welcomeness crowds out their sound and shape from my memory . I was to become a dweller in this grand villa of life , but I the knocker sounded and I turned to the foyer to see Capricorn , the black servant , admitting , to my great surprise , a most serious-visaged Emmett Daugherty , and with him a weeping girl of perhaps eight years , a boy somewhat younger than myself who was tilting his head back and blotting his nose with a filthy and bloody rag , and a woman , the children 's mother , in a state as wretched as womanhood can inhabit . Hillegond was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we stared at these representatives of a gravely negative unknown . Emmett led the woman and children to a sofa in the foyer , then asked to speak with Lyman Fitzgibbon , who had come to the mansion for the soiree . Lyman heard Emmett 's request and rose from his seat in the music room . I followed but kept my distance , seeing Matty , another of the black servants , run to the kitchen and return with a wet towel to clean the boy 's bloody face , take the old rag from him , and lay him full-length on a bench with his head back . " It 's a tragic thing , " Emmett said , " Alfie Palmer , one of the moulders let go in the layoff , he did this to them . " " Why do you bring them here ? " Lyman asked . " It 's a foundry matter , Lyman , " said Emmett . " And it 's your foundry . " " Does Harris know about this ? " Lyman asked , Harris being the Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've no use for that man , Lyman . It 's his layoffs began this trouble . Your good self is what 's needed . None other . Alfie was always a hard-luck man , and with the layoff he had no doctor money when his son got sick , and he could only watch the boy die . It maddened him , as it would any man , and he took to the drink , though I do n't know where he got money for that . And there 's been fights  --  dozens  --  between the new hired men and the old let go , and Alfie in more than his share of those . But he went beyond a punch-up tonight . He followed Toddy Ryan home when Toddy left the foundry , giving him heat , do n't you know . But Toddy 's only the half-pint , with no health to him at all , and he knew if he fought Alfie he 'd be killed sure as sure is , and so he ran to his shack and barred the door , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ax handle . Then he went after young Joey here , and it looks like he broke the lad 's nose . Toddy 's wife throws the boilin ' tea in Alfie 's face , gets the children out , and brings them to the foundry to find me . But her Toddy 's dead on the floor and there 's no peace for it now , Lyman , no peace . Alfie 's on the run and the men are in camps , the old and the new . They 'll fight in bunches , and they 're forming already . There 'll be blood in the streets by morning . " Emmett , his craggy face overgrown with two days ' stubble of beard , was a scolding presence . He was foreman at Lyman 's North End foundry , the largest stove-making foundry in the city , and had risen in eleven years , despite his lung ailment , from apprentice to moulder to chief grievance spokesman , a voice of righteous reason from below . His rise in status began when he hired on as coachman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adirondack region for a new railroad line . Animosity toward the venture was strong , the natives convinced the railroad would before long destroy their pristine world ( and so it would ) , and the animus peaked when half a dozen mountain men set upon Lyman and his lawyer with plans to tar and feather both . While Lyman contemplated probable death by absurdity , Emmett garroted one of the attackers and bargained the man 's breath for the two captives , an act of bravery that ensured not only his own security ever after through Lyman 's gratitude , but also the education of any Daugherty heir not yet born , or even conceived , on this night of tribulation in the foyer of Hillegond Staats 's mansion . not only does the city shun them but the constabulary and the posses meet them at the docks and on the turnpikes to herd them together in encampments on the city 's great western plain . Keep them moving is the edict of the city 's leaders , and with obscene pleasure the Albany wharf rats and river scum ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out this edict by stoning the canal boats that try to unload newcomers here . It is no wonder the greenhorns grow feral in response , finding in this new land a hatred as great as that which drove them out of Ireland , that suppurating , dying sow of a nation . Looking at the Ryans one could believe them carriers of any perniciousness : defeated , low in spirit , clad in rags , their skin flaked , pale , and dirty , their hair matted , their eyes raw with the disease of all victims . Who would invite their like ? Who would give them bread or bed ? None in this city today , and yet not quite none , for Hillegond is telling Capricorn to find them street- and bedclothes ; telling Matty to cook for , cleanse , and accept them on their night of trouble here in this haven for ravaged souls . People were breaking into groups now in the mansion . In the east parlor Will Canaday , here too for the music , was in dark communion with Lyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom I had most in common : Joey Ryan of the bleeding nose  --  but bleeding no more seated now at the kitchen table eating Matty 's chicken soup and corn bread . I told him I was sorry for his trouble and that my father was dead also , and at least he had his mother with him , but that my mother was dead and so was my sister , from the cholera . " You 're an orphan , then , " he said . " 1 am . " " What do they do to orphans ? Do they kill them ? " " I 've never heard of that , " I said , " and they have n't killed me yet . But sometimes they put them in orphan homes , and sometimes they let them run loose . " " I 'd fancy to run loose , " he said . " Run loose till I grow up enough to solve the man who killed me father . " " How will you solve him ? " " I 'll break his skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll get bigger and find him and break his skull like he broke me father 's . " " They 'll hang you . " " Do they hang orphans ? " " They hang you for breaking a man 's skull . " " Will they hang the man that killed me father ? " " If they catch him they might . " " I 'll hang him meself , and then I 'll cut off his head . " The Ryan boy was only a little fellow , but vengeance burned in his eye , and if he did n't break one man 's skull before long , he 'd break another 's . Anger had taken seed in him farther back than the clubbing of his father , as I learned when I asked where he came from in Ireland . " From a ditch near Cashel , " he said . " The landlord tumbled our house and put us off our land , and me father piled all we owned in a cart and we pushed it till we could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used the wagon as a roof . We could see the Galty Mountains from the ditch . They tumbled our house to make room for the landlord 's cows . They 're in grave need of pasture , ' the landlord told me pa . Then we left the ditch , threw things away to lighten our load , and the three of us hauled the cart up the mountain , a terrible high mountain of four hundred feet it was , and me sister settin ' the block at the wheel . We done it at last and got over the mountain , but goin ' down the back side was near as troublesome as goin ' up the front , and we almost lost the cart two or three assorted times . We begged food , and when we could n't get any we stole it , or we ate grass . Then we went to me uncle 's place on the road to Tipperary , and he took us in and paid for Pa to go to America . Pa himself is all of us that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake for his leavin ' , with me ma keenin ' for hours over his goin ' . ' Ye wo n't come back for us , ' she kept saying . It was near to bury him , is what it was . But he sent remittances and got us all over here , me and me sister and me mother . And did n't we all come to this town of Albany , because we could n't fit in New York in the wee room Pa lived in . We was here just a few weeks and no money left when he got the foundry job , and then , a little after that , they broke his skull , the man did , the bastard man . " I talked more with the boy , but it was so painful I soon left him and thought of going to bed , for I could find no one else to talk to . People were all over the house talking of the coming fight and how awful it would be , and I knew I would watch it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capricorn brought the news before sunrise from the foundry would invade this grand home to kill children . As for Joey , he kept himself busy through the night creating a slungshot , a bludgeon fashioned from a rock wrapped in oilcloth and wound tight with string . I saw him in an upstairs hallway flexing his creation cleverly : slapping it with thuds against his left palm . When I saw his mother , Margaret Ryan , and his sister , Molly , at morning , they looked no less affrighted than they had the previous evening , but immeasurably more comely with clean skin and hair and fresh clothing . The tea was steeping in the kitchen , ' ' fatty was taking bread from the oven , and our cluster of souls was gathering near the warmth of the fire . The good feeling among us all seemed inappropriate with a death struggle in the offing , but I attest that thirteen years hence the same feelings would prevail in me when , as a correspondent in the war , I 'd speak with soldiers and other journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rankest order and convince each other it was fitting nectar for those about to conquer , or die , or both , or neither . I must convey now that the fated stroke that aligned Alfie Palmer against the Ryans was an event of historical moment in Albany , for it defined boundaries , escalated hatreds , and set laboring men of near-equal dimension and common goal against each other . In years to come , periodic battles would be waged anew as a consequence of what was about to happen this day . These battles , which invariably took place on Sundays , when men were off work and free to maim one another , raged for hours without interference from the constabulary . The battles ( the first was called the Ryans against the Palmers ) were in time called the Hills against the Creeks , the Hills being the neighborhood to which Alfie Palmer , and others like him , had risen : high ground that represented a social ascendancy from where the Creeks lived  --  the low-lying slums , the mean and fetid nest of hovels on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shacks of the Irish erupted overnight like anarchic mushrooms and where the killing of Toddy Ryan took place . Will Canaday returned to the mansion after breakfast , and he and Lyman , who had stayed the night , made ready to leave . I followed behind , and Joey Ryan behind me . " No , no , " Will said to us . " You stay here . Down there is no place for children . Take care of the boy here , " and he pointed to Joey . " It would he good for my education to see such a thing , " I said . " I want you alive to get an education , " said Will as he and the others climbed into the carriage . Hillegond stood in the doorway as the animal , and more fit than I for such a run , which was two miles or more across open fields , down the gully , and over the footbridge that spanned the Patroon 's Creek , then up the hill on the far side , where I lost sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would head for Canal Street , where he lived , and it was toward that notorious thoroughfare that I headed . Bells welcomed me to the populated city , and I saw women and children walking  --  toward church , I presumed . People were also moving into a vacant field that began the long slope eastward toward the canal and the river . At the crest of the field I saw forty or more men below me , standing , talking , many with clubs in hand . I sensed what they were about and that they would not be likely to give allegiance to Toddy Ryan . I kept walking south and approached Canal Street , with its creek coursing beside it . This was the neighborhood called Gander Bay , named after the sassy fowl the Irish kept in the Foxenkill . It was a place of dread and danger , of woe and truculence . Its dirt pathways , which became deep and pervasive mud when it rained , were narrow , crooked , and violable by the sudden erection of hovels that would force a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been thrown together in a day , an upthrust of uneven boards with no windows , buttressed by sod or raw earth . Looming up among them was the occasional giant of an ordinary house , half a century old , built when this was open space and the crowd had not yet arrived . I 'd been in the area before , but not often . It gave no welcome to strangers . In one of the big houses near the creek lived two old brothers , Dinny Reilly , who collected grease from neighbors to make soap ( for a certain amount of grease he 'd give you a bar of soap ) , and Johnny Reilly , called Johnny the Cats , who went to jail at cholera time for throwing dead cats into the Foxenkill . Johnny won his name by living with four dozen cats , and the neighborhood rhyme about the men was known all over town : Pitty-pat , sugar and fat , Old Dinny Reilly and Johnny the Cats . Children were running free , and women were doing their washing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gander Bay 's early sunlight . A man sat astride a backless chair in the doorway of one shanty , arms folded , pipe in teeth , back stiff and straight : prepared for events . Around him lay half a dozen cats and took him to be Johnny of the thyme . " Good morning , sir , " I said . " It 's a good morning if ye think it is , " he said . " Do you know where the Ryans live ? " " There 's Ryans the world over . " " A boy . Joey Ryan . His father was Toddy . " " Aaah , those Ryans . Ye 'd best stay away from that house . " " I know Joey , I want to help him . " " Then folly your nose that way and ye wo n't miss it . " My nose led me along a dirt lane , soft from the previous day 's moderate rains , to a turning where I saw a crowd of people , and above them the head and shoulders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wagon , haranguing the crowd with vibrant oratory : " This is what comes of bein ' an Irish workin ' man , " and he turned his gaze downward , then up again to the crowd . " A good man . . alive with the family last night ... then murdered in front of his children .. Toddy Ryan gone today ... who 'll go tomorrow ? " The silent crowd was with the man , nodding its reverence . Children on the edge moved away when his pause broke their attention . A gray-haired woman in a threadbare shawl pushed forward , her hair tight in a bun , her jaw jutting out with anger . " I knew Toddy Ryan , " she said . " He was a good man and he deserves better than you 're givin ' him . Look at him there , shameful . " ( We all looked toward the wagon , but I could see nothing because of intervening bodies . ) " Bring the man indoors and wake him properly . It 's sacrilegious , this is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the man in the wagon . " They 'll be after you next , and then after your children . " " Where 's this fight you 're talkin ' about ? " a man in the crowd asked . " We start at the foot of Lumber Street , " came the answer . " There 'll he clubs there for all . We 'll move in a body and meet the divvil himself if he 's a mind to fight us . " Satisfied with the answer , the questioner nodded and moved away . Others followed him , leaving an opening that let me see the wagon .. Toddy Ryan lay on three boards nailed together , tied down with a rope around his waist so he would n't slide off , the boards slanted to allow us full view of his final image : hands folded on his chest , toes of his shoes too long and turned up , ill-fitting clothes full of stains and holes  --  a runt of a man who , in addition to being horridly dead , had died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wound were the unforgettable focus of the cautionary tableau he offered us : Here lies a dead Irishman , The speaker resumed his harangue and some in the crowd fell away . But newcomers kept arriving in a steady stream , and I learned that Toddy , since daybreak , had been on tour of all Irish neighborhoods in the city 's north and west ends , a traveling theater piece : drama in the flesh . I asked a woman beside me where the dead man had lived . " Over there , is n't it ? " she said , pointing to a board shanty . I went to it and saw the door and wooden latch Alfie Palmer had kicked in . I called Joey 's name but got no answer , then saw the interior was dark and barren , lit only by the light from the open door , and on the floor a broken clay pot and rusty tin cup . Whatever else of life 's things the Ryans once owned had been removed by scavengers . Sunlight shone across the large bloodstain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . I considered what I should do in this place , then stepped fully inside , closed the door , and shut out the day . The room became blackness of a deep order . I breathed the smell of earth and tried to imagine the life of the Ryans in this tiny room , then tried to imagine them living in a ditch with their wagon as a roof . Poor as we Quinns had been ( and we had gone weeks without money , our food all charity from relatives ) , never were we dirt-poor , nor ever before had I understood the meaning of that phrase : to live day and night inhaling the odor of raw earth . I felt like a burrowing animal , and thought how the Ryans must have cursed all things and people that had brought them to this condition , and how they must have envied all who lived above it . Istepped back into the sunlight and saw that sleeves , vibrant in their gestures , anticipating the greater vibrancy of battle . A dozen or two smaller boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being handed out from a wagon . I knew a few of the men : Walter White and Petey Carey from Van Woert Street ; Midge McTigue , who had worked at the lumberyard with my father . I guessed that my father would have been with these men had he been alive . I could not find Joey Ryan but I saw Emmett , still unshaven , probably sleepless , and looking gravely upset as he grabbed two men by their shirts . I heard his words : " It 's madness to fight uphill ... madness to fight at all this way . " " Too late for that jabber , Emmett , " one man said , knocking Emmett 's hand from his shirt . Emmett pushed through the head of the crowd to yell to them all , " Do n't do this , men ... we 'll have a dozen corpses among us before the day is out ... " One hoarse voice called out , " By the Christ , let 's get on with it , " and at that the men , numbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them pocketing stones as they went . And then came the rap of the clubs on the cobblestones in steady tattoo : rap , step , rap , step , rap , step , rap  --  this in march cadence , which the men 's feet found compatible ; and they moved to it . Emmett saw me , came to me , grabbed my arm . " You 're not in this , boy . I say you 're not . " " I was looking for Joey Ryan . He 's out to get Alfie Palmer . " " That puny little thing after Alfie ? " " He wants to cut his head off . " Emmett shook his head . " Madness everywhere , " he said . Then he looked at the men moving up the hill . " I 've got to get with them . " " Are you going to fight , Emmett ? " " Not if I can help it . But maybe I can do some good . " " I 'll go with you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then see it , but stay on the sides . " I had no animosity toward Alfie Palmer , whom I did n't know ; nor did I feel it my responsibility to champion the cause of Toddy Ryan beyond keeping track of Joey . I walked with Emmett and we caught up with the men as they turned a corner . Spectators joined us : old men , young men , women and children  --  all on the run from other streets as word of the battle spread ; and we moved like a Roman parade , marching the gladiators to the arena . The men kept themselves a tight body as they marched , but when they sighted the enemy waiting two blocks up Colonie Street hill , some behind barricades , their cries went up : " Kill the bastards ... go now ... get ' em , " and they broke ranks and with wordless screams ran forward . The Ryans , doing themselves no favor running uphill , ran into a hail of stones and paving blocks . They returned them in kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity and raised clubs , flung their bodies at the uphillers and felled sixteen into varying states of unconsciousness , losing only half a dozen of their own number in that opening charge . The smack of fists on flesh , the whap of club on skull collided with the curses and whoops of the warriors . Iron bars came into use , though the dominant fashion was the club , either of these tools cumbersome in close combat and some quickly discarded so as to allow fighting with fists and teeth , the battlers rolling and tussling into the proper position to gouge an eye , chew an ear . The battle opened itself and tumbled down new streets and into the pasture that sloped toward Van Woert Street , the growing mob of spectators ringing the fighters , moving with the most vicious , cheering them on to ever grander gouging and bashing . There exists in the spectacle of a mass of men in fistic battle a love of punishment and pain , a need to be smashed in the mouth by life or else risk losing sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would see much worse , but I 'd seen nothing before to equal the violence of this day : the ripped shirts , the bloody faces , the noses and ears bitten half off , the torn and bloody fists with their naked bones , men spitting out teeth , men unable to stand , one man shot but the pistol never found , a dozen men stabbed , two dozen with fractured heads , and some to die of these things and be buried in secret , one of the Palmers stabbed in both arms and never the same after . I saw Emmett remove from the fray the man who did that stabbing , a Ryan , but one not to Emmett 's liking , and so he punched him , bur once , on the side of the bead , and the man fell like ten pounds of liver . Emmett took the man 's dirk from his hand and rolled him down the hill . Women ministered to fallen battlers , blotting their wounds , pulling them to safer turf . I spied a man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorch in full bloom , and I wondered , was this Alfie Palmer ? The raw look of him just might have come from a bath in boiling tea . ( How had the Ryans boiled their tea in that closed shack ? I saw no chimney , nor any opening for one . Did they live amid smoke ? ) Such was Palmer 's face ( and it was his ) that it could not have heretofore eluded me , and I concluded he was a latecomer to the battle . But that face was known , and when it appeared , it magnetically convened the Ryan lust for vengeance , Alfie quickly . ringed by more men than could possibly reach him with club or fist . He knocked down two Ryans with his club before he went under : under by choice , I must now think , for what reason other than guilt or suicidal madness could have compelled him to enter this battlefield of hate as a willful target ? He went down and felt the rain of kicks by Ryan brogans until a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal Palmer of the day they could not ; for while other Ryans heat the Palmers back , a man all in Albany would come to recognize from this instant forward as Horse Houlihan , a lumber handler of immense size and girth , picked up the inert Al-fie and , with great strength and unerring method , broke both his arms and both his legs , cracking each arm over bent knee , stepping on each leg and then snapping it upward , the reverse of its natural flex . The pain of the first break revived Alfie into a scream , but he then lapsed back into his coma and accepted the other fractures without a whimper . The battle moved in splintered struggles away from the useless Alfie , the last of his reduction being the gob of spit Horse Houlihan loosed on him . And there he lay , a man of spoiled body and soul , a testament 10 what ? To an incomplete understanding of the forces that had been unleashed through his loss of job and death of son ; of even less comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengeance on the tragic Toddy . Madness was insufficient designation for what had come of it , for what arose among the battlers was not pathology but something more conscious of itself : the final horrific begetting now blossoming in Joey Ryan , who came out of the crowd after the spectators had shifted with the flow . He found himself standing alone , moving slowly forward and then kneeling to perform with stunning malice the final coda of Alfie 's saga : pummeling the near-dead face of his father 's murderer with his slungshot as he shouted " Bastard man , bastard man " over and over , until I pulled him away and was , myself , struck by inadvertence with the weapon , no less painfully for Joey 's lack of intent . My intervention came too late , for the slungshot had created bloody craters on Alfie 's face and permanently blinded his right eye , a total blinding having been Joey 's intention from the moment he espied the inert form . l cuffed Joey and flung his weapon away from him , pulled him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion , and we left all Ryans and Palmers behind us . The Ryans , after several retreats , regroupings , and two hours of blood , finally routed the Palmers . Alfie Palmer survived to become the half-blind cripple of Arbor Hill , spent four years in jail after confessing the murder of Toddy Ryan , and lived out his remaining days as drunken beggar and infamous martyr to the unfathomable rhythms of rage . Newspapers reported on the battle , calling it a feud between Papists and Americans , between the Irish and the Know-Nothings ( who numbered in their political ranks the enraged nativists and assorted hybrid-haters bent on shaping a balance in this republic of equals by expelling the unequals ) . Will Canaday , in a departure from reasonableness , noted that a number of probable deaths , and an unmeasurable maiming of heads , had been effected in the battle , and he concluded : " It is not enough . Let them keep at it until there are no more of their heads to be broken . " Will 's view was widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that the mob at fury 's peak has no politics , no ethnic allegiance , no religion , but is a rabid beast with bloody claws , and must be neutralized. 0 n the Monday after the battle I went to
