THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE will not swear to it , but we think that what 's bothering us started several seasons ago with an announcer for a National Football League game  --  it could have been an announcer for any of the three television networks . Whatever its origin , it has now spread like smog across the entire sporting horizon . It is the phrase " coming off " ( or , sometimes , " coming off of " ) . Obviously , " coming off " can be used in any number of apt ways and in several time-honored senses ; for instance , " The election is coming off as scheduled " or " The candidate is coming off well in his campaign appearances " or " My hat keeps coming off my head . " What we are objecting to is the use of " coming off " to mean " to have just finished " or " to have just recovered from " or simply " to have . " Joe Klecko , the defensive end for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second game of the football season just ended , and before long the announcers were telling us that he was " coming off a knee injury . " Around the calendar , baseball players are coming off slumps ; tennis players are coming off victories at Wimbledon ; basketball teams are coming off poor seasons ; hockey teams are coming off winning streaks . Enough is enough . Come off it . APORTLY middle-aged friend reports : My New Year 's resolutions generally hold up pretty well during the first part of January . Toward the end of the month , however , they tend to lose momentum ; they lumber through a few final orbits and plunge harmlessly into the sea . This year , starting January 1st , I swore to abandon my standard diet ( peanut butter ; coffee cake ; cheeseburgers ; fudge sundaes ; beer ; chopped-liver and turkey sandwiches ; Raisinets ; spaghetti carbonara ; jelly beans ; Brie ; chocolate-covered cherries ; cashew nuts ; and chicken corn ) in exchange for a regimen largely devoid of calories , and dominated by ' green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerator , stocked up on celery and cans of consomm ? , and , for the fortnight following , did my best . Late on a miserable evening in mid-January , however , the effort came to an end . I must have sugar , and now . I raced to the refrigerator : soggy lettuce ; wilted celery ; a puckered cantaloupe . At this hour , all the local stores were closed , and outside the rat-ding window an icy rain was thrashing the trees . I ransacked the apartment , opening drawers , slamming them shut . Circling the room like a caged beast , I found myself back at the refrigerator , opened it , and saw  --  lodged hi a shelf on the door  --  an old box of brown sugar . Brown sugar ! I tore open the box and its plastic bag , and discovered a hunk of brown sugar the size of a baseball . Trembling with gratitude , I picked up a teaspoon and dipped into the bag . Clink ! The sugar was not only the size of a baseball but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bag , picked up a carving knife , and tried to cut a slice . No luck . I sawed at it No use . I held the nugget in the palm of my hand and rapped it smartly with the knife handle . Then I tried grinding at it , using a corkscrew as a drill . I picked up a squash racquet and began whacking with that ; the only effect was a fine brown spray of sugar settling on the furniture . I wrapped the meteorite in a towel and slammed it against the wall . Nothing . Frenzy was closing in . I opened a cabinet and found a hammer . I took the hammer and the brown sugar into the bathroom . I put the petrified lump on the tiled floor , knelt down , and began pounding it with the hammer . The noise was thunderous . Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! The entire building seemed to shudder . Boom ! Boom ! After a while , I paused to rest , gasping and panting  --  the lump was still intact  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What would they think ? Incoming artillery rounds ? The building being demolished by a giant crane ? Gas mains exploding ? Bowling balls bounding down the stairs ? The one thing they would never imagine , I realized with some relief , was that a fat middle-aged neighbor was kneeling on the cold floor of his bathroom in the middle of the night attacking a hunk of brown sugar with a hammer . Bookshop ON a cold , sunny day last week , we went up to visit the arcade of the brand-new Park Avenue Plaza office building , which has entrances on Fifty-second and Fifty-third Streets between Madison and Park . We particularly wanted to check reports that had been floating around about a sighting in the arcade of a nearly extinct species  --  a small independent bookstore , not part of Megabooks , Inc. , or the Volume Volume Company , or Bookvend , a wholly owned subsidiary of Gargantua International . A real . bookshop has n't opened in mid- town in many , many years . The Park Avenue Plaza less steel all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator bank and a cafe on the other , along with Ficus trees and other " plantings , " to make you feel you 're in Nature ? only , it 's a weird kind of nature , because there are escalators in it and surveillant closed-circuit-TV cameras dangling from the trees . We went along the shop side and found the dinosaur : Chartwell Booksellers , with a handsome display of old and new books in one window and a big piece of blank white paper in the other , along with a sign on the door in between indicating that the shop wo n't open until March 15th . But mission accomplished anyway , we figured happily , and we went wandering toward the cafe side , pausing now and then to turn around in little , astonished circles or to look up at the simulated skylight and try to figure out where an eerie electronic-sounding beep was coming from . We were standing almost immobilized in the middle of this vast modernistic architectural space when a trim young man who looked like Richard Gere with a revisionist Devo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singer , the manager of Chartwell Booksellers , and said he 'd noticed our interest in the shop . He also remarked on our dazed condition , and invited us to join him and Stanley Lewis , the book-buying consultant for the shop , at one of the caf ? ' s graterdisc-like tables ( they 're round and made of steel and have holes in them ) close to the arcade 's east wall , which is covered with copper shingles , and down which , almost deafeningly , water cascades . More nature . Mr. Singer , who is twenty-five , had on a red V-necked sweater with a blue shirt underneath , gray-blue wool slacks , and rimless round glasses . Mr. Lewis , who used to manage Books &; Co. , on Madison Avenue , and , before that , owned Parnassus  --  a wonderful little bookshop on the upper West Side , which he had to close in 1976 ? is in his forties . He is bald , has a red beard going gray at the chin , and smiles like Mayor Koch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , and gray slacks . At the table , Mr. Lewis said of the bookshop , " We 're trying for a combination of ? " " the best of the old and the new , " Mr. Singer said . " The shop was the idea of Mr. Richard Fisher , who is one of the owners of the building , " Mr. Lewis said . LEWIS : We 'll have hooks on architecture , fashion , photography , and history and biography in a big way . MR . SINGER : And current fiction , but nothing schiocky . MR . LEWIS : It 's a small shop , and we 're going to stock it --  MR . SINGER : ? according to our own dictates , if you will . MR . Law 's : We 'll have antiquarian books as well as new ones . We 'll be featuring " The Vatican Frescoes of Michelangelo , " the seven-thousanddollar limited-edition Abbeville book , to coincide with the Vatican exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum . MR . SINGER : We want to get to know our clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEWIS : To cultivate accounts that will he with us for years . MR . SINGER : Chartwell is the name of Winston Churchill 's country house . MR . Lrwts : Mr. Fisher is a big Churchill man . Ma . SINGER ! We hope that people will hear about the store or just stumble on it , and we hope that the people who work in the building will patronize it , too , of course . MR . LEWIS : Though we 're not sure what bankers read . MR . SINGER : Would you like to see the place ? MR . LEWIS : It 's not much to look at right now , but .. . We accompanied Mr. Lewis and Mr. Singer back across the arcade and into what will soon be Chartwell Booksellers . It was a shell of plywood and floorboards covered with plaster dust , and there were ducts and wires and cables exposed where the ceiling will soon be . " At least , you can see that it 's going to he on two levels , like an English shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lewis said . " Hand-carved , " Mr. FEBRUARY 7,1983 We went back outside , because the workmen in the shop were making quite a racket moving their ladders around . " You can also see that Elizabeth Arden has a store and a display right next to us , " Mr. Lewis said . " It does n't exactly fit in with what we 're trying to do , " Mr. Singer said . Conversation UDR a moment , forget the Stray 1 . Cats and Adam Ant . Put The Police and Men at Work on hold . Tune in to Helen O'Connell singing her sultry version of " Tangerine " and Betty Hutton belting " Arthur Murray Taught Me Dancing in a Hurry . " That 's what we did the other evening when we dropped by the Grand Hyatt Hotel to watch " Jukebox Saturday Night , " a nostalgic look at pop music of the thirties and forties , which WNET was taping before seven hundred and fifty invited guests . The show , whose m.c. was Eddie Albert , and which will be telecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whiting , Helen Forrest , Keely Smith , Helen O'Connell , Betty Hutton , Jack Leonard , Bea Wain , and Herb Jeffries ) , one quartet ( the Modernaires ) , and a cool jazz band ( Bob Crosby 's Bobcats , who were celebrating their forty-eighth year in the business ) . Backstage at intermission resembled a 1940 high-school reunion . Helen O'Connell , tall , blond , and beautiful in a flowered white chiffon dress , embraced Betty Hutton , who was wearing black chiffon , and said , " You could n't have done better . No way . " " I was pretty scared , " said Miss Hutton , who was shaking slightly , " but I did sing an encore . " Herb Jeffries and Jack Leonard were comparing notes on current engagements ; Bob Crosby was drinking coffee with three of his white-haired musicians , whom we identified as Yank Lawson ( trumpet ) , Eddie Miller ( saxophone ) , and Bobby Haggart ( bass ) ; and Helen Forrest , a tiny strawberry blonde in a red-sequinned dress , was joking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ve talked to Margaret Whiting and Keely Smith , who told us they had recently done a show with Betty Hutton in Hackensack , New Jersey . " Keely 's singing at Marty 's , and I have a new album out , " said Miss Whiting . " We all take care of ourTHE NEW YORKER selves , we 're singing well , and it seems that our time has come back again . " Helen O'Connell told us she was off on a cruise to Hong Kong with her group called Four Girls Four , and Bea Wain said that she and her husband , Andr ? Baruch , were re-creating " Your Hit Parade " as a syndicated radio show ( " We pick a week and a year and play the top songs " ) . Jack Leonard , the vocalist who preceded Frank Sinatra with Tommy Dorsey 's band , told us that Dorsey 's famous arrangement of " Marie , " which he was singing in the show , had been inspired by the Sunset Royal Serenaders , a black hand that had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it over , I sang the lead and the band sang the patter , and over the years we sold three million records , " he said . Bob Crosby told us that " Big Noise from Winnetka , " one of his great hits , had been invented during a tea dance at Chicago 's Blackhawk restaurant in 1938 . " We 'd played our whole library one afternoon , and when the kids from Northwestern sat down on the dance floor and hollered for more I turned in desperation to Bobby Haggart , my bass player , and Ray Baudur , my drummer , and asked them to vamp , " he said . " Bobby , who has a hole between his front teeth , started to whistle , and Ray soloed on the drums . Then Ray beat on Bohhy 's bass , and Bobby fingered a blues melody . We thought it was funny at the time , but it 's still so popular that Bobby 's playing it tonight . " Toward the end of the evening , we heard the Bobcats play " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parade . " When the audience gave them a standing ovation , the band responded with " At the Jazz Band Ball , " trading solos back and forth with the easy precision of musicians who have worked together for a very bong time . Afterward , Mr. Crosby said , " You know , jazz is basically conversation , and when it happens the way it did here tonight it 's the most exhilarating thing in the world . " Few Seconds with /Indy Rooney A r : : DREw A. ROONEY cruised into the New Year with his " A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney " happily perched at the top of the paperback-best-seller lists and with its sequel , " And More by Andy Rooney , " at the top of the hardcover roost . We paid a brief call on the recipient of these impressive honors at nine one morning at his office , in the CBS News building , on West Fifty-seventh Street , where he puts together his " 60 Minutes " bits and writes his syndicated column  --  he has two standard typewriters there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is sixty-three  --  to find out how his uncommon primacy has affected him . " It 's incredible , " Rooney said . " My publishers at Atheneum tell me that the first book has sold over four hundred thousand in hardcover by now and that the second is apparently headed toward six hundred thousand . It 's all a publishing phenomenon that , I gather , nobody seems quite able to understand , and I certainly do n't understand it myself . Of the half-dozen books I 've written over the last thirty-five years or so , a couple sold pretty well , but there was never anything like this . Where were all those readers back when I needed them ? " Rooney , who has been a prolific writer of radio and television scripts since 1949 , said he is trying not to let success change his habits . " I live in the same house , in Rowayton , that my wife and I bought for about twenty-nine thousand dollars thirty years ago , " he said . " It 's a Victorian house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button , the heat comes up . And the roof is pretty tight . True , my wife complains that it 's not big enough for us to entertain more than ten people at a time , but I 'd just as soon be down in the basement anyway . I 'm a big woodworker , when I have time for that . I 'm lucky , I guess , because I do n't need much sleep . I 'm in my office here at seven-thirty every morning , and that means I have to get up at five-forty . But I sleep on the train going home , and I also take naps after lunch . I 'm a quick napper . If I can lose consciousness for three minutes , I 'm refreshed . I once read that Thomas Edison was like that . I usually turn in at home no later than eleven-thirty , and when I wake up I hop right out of bed . It 's one of the things that surprise me about myself . I see no reason to alter my routine . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to be rich without acting as the rich act ' ? I do n't know now whether that 's true or not . I 've been invited lately to parties I was never invited to before  --  a new bunch of interesting , rich people  --  but I generally do n't go . A writer should be in the position of observing , not of being observed . Television had made me somewhat observable even before the books came out , of course , and that was bad enough . I like to be at the side of the room watching other people dance instead of performing in the middle of the ballroom floor . It 's hard to resist enjoying it when people come up and say , ' I love your book , ' but when they ask for your autograph that 's too much . Oh , well , this wo n't last . I 've seen what 's been happening to me happen to so many people so many times , and before long they are forgotten . " Rooney said that so far he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to make . " I refuse to go out and sell my books , " he said . " It 's a disgraceful thing for a writer to do . Atheneum had me hooked on the Johnny Carson show and ' Today , ' and they were shocked when I begged off . I said , ' I 'm sorry , I want the books to be a success , too , but I wo n't do that . ' And I wo n't go on the lecture circuit , either . I get ten or twelve requests a day now to do that ; it ties up the phone something terrible . Of course , one can always make exceptions to one 's rules . A while ago , I was asked to give a talk in Hawaii in wintertime , five thousand dollars , bring out your wife for a week , all expenses paid , and I said to my assistant here , Jane Bradford , ' Jane , I think I 'll make this one last exception . ' Then , just the other day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bring your wife for a week , all expenses . I was a little embarrassed to hear myself saying , ' Jane , I think I can once more make this one last exception . ' Anyway , I 'm not sure I 'm a popular speaker , because I have a couple of obsessions . First , the preference that Americans seem to have for not facing the truth about anything . Look at our bookstores . Most of the best-sellers are cookbooks and diet books  --  how not to eat it after you 've cooked it . Second , the dominance of salesmanship in the American market . We 're constantly selling things better than we 're making them . I find this sad . I 'm very suspicious of automobile companies whose presidents have come out of sales rather than engineering . When I try these themes out in front of an audience , I FEBRUARY 7,1983 seem to be more interested in them than anybody I 'm talking to . " Rooney told ' us that his publishers have been after him to put together yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing me ! " he said . " But I 'm in no hurry to do another book that , like the last two , is a collection of TV and newspaper pieces , though I have enough stuff on hand for one right now  --  when you do three newspaper columns a week , it adds up . I 'd like to do an eating book one of these days  --  not a recipe book but a book about observing the eating scene . Atheneum wants me to sign a contract for some kind of book , but I do n't want to . Why should I make a promise on a piece of paper ? if I write another book , I 'll just give it to them . Although I must say I can remember when I was glad to get any kind of advance . " Shortly before Christmas , Rooney was heard to say on " 60 Minutes " ? some auditors thought not altogether unself-promotionally ? " My advice is this : just give everyone a good book . " ? Ve asked him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , how . " I did give one of my kids Robert Caro 's ' Johnson , ' " he said . " I do n't read any fiction , so 1 did n't give any fiction . I bought myself Antony Flew 's ' Introduction to Western Philosophy , ' and I hope to get around to reading it . I buy more books than I read . I 'm a sort of reader in bed  --  mostly the classics . I 'm really not a big reader ; my wife says I 've written more books than I 've read . " Moving Day ANEW-CAR smell persisted in the disinfected air ; the silence was broken only by the distant noise of men installing the last few telephones ; sunlight blazed in through big windows on dozens of never-been-slept-in beds . At 7 A.M. last Saturday , Rita Conyers , a vice-president of St. Vincent 's Hospital , gave us a tour of the hospital 's new John A. Coleman Pavilion , on Seventh Avenue between Eleventh and Twelfth Streets : sixteen stories of pastel decor and shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reTHE NEW YORKER ceiving its first two hundred and twenty-five patients  --  transfers from other hospital buildings . We were captured by the thought that , hospitals being what they are , the rooms and hallways we were wandering through would never again he as still  --  not at night , not on weekends , not on holidays , not ever until the day when this brand-new building had become antique and was dosed . The seventh floor of the hospital 's Smith/Raskob Building , right next door , could n't have been much more crowded or much busier than it was that morning . As soon as breakfast  --  orange juice , eggs , Danish , and coffee  --  was cleared away , all the patients on the floor ( which consisted of private and semiprivate rooms ) would move , via wheelchair or stretcher , to the new building . Hospital workers jammed into the nurses ' station , a small glassed-in room , and lined the corridor outside  --  aqua-coated nutrition aides , blue-suited orderlies , white-uniformed dietitians , white-jacketed interns , and a great many nuns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I guess we really ca n't jam breakfast down their throats , " said one nun , with a smile . Moving several hundred hospital patients takes more planning than moving several hundred armchairs , say . Armchairs do n't require oxygen from tanks , or a steady supply of intravenous medication , or occasional assurances that , yes , they 've almost reached their new quarters . The planners of this particular move had been gathered in the hospital boardroom , on the ground floor of an adjacent building , since six-thirty that morning , and , armed with walkie-talkies , coffee cake , and very detailed schedules , they seemed to be enjoying themselves . The game plan had been decided on weeks in advance  --  eventually , right down to computer printouts specifying which patients needed bolsters for their pillows  --  and it was now simply a question of execution . Only one problem had cropped up : a relay had blown , rendering the new hank of elevators about as speedy as a midtown cab at lunchtime , and this meant that some heavy equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . The rest of the hitches were minor . Returning from a check of a ward in another of the buildings , William Wilson , St. Vincent 's vice-president for management services , smiled widely and reported , " On Spellman three , all the patients are relaxed . And they 're eating better than ever . " At about seven-thirty , the big shift got under way . Lines of patients in wheelchairs , each one pushed by a gold-coated transporter and accompanied by a pink-clad volunteer who was charged with carrying personal belongings , began forming outside the Coleman elevators to wait their turn . An enormous cart rolled by , holding all the flowers from one floor in the old building . A priest , Father Donald Poulin , was the first patient to reach his new room , on the twelfth floor of Coleman . He expressed pleasure at his unobstructed view of lower Manhattan but seemed doubtful whether the vista quite compensated for the lack of a television set ( the necessary fixtures had yet to he installed ) , especially considering the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days away from open-heart surgery , surveyed the Hudson from the window of his room , nearby . " I never thought I 'd enjoy looking at New Jersey , " he said . Glancing around the ultra-modern room , lie added , " I feel as if I were in one of those movie hospitals . " The nurses seemed delighted with their new quarters . On Coleman seven , they were busy testing the lights above the doorway to each room , which blinked white in an emergency , green if a nurse was needed , and amber to call an aide . By this time , the seventh floor of Smith/Raskob , which for several generations had contained scores of sick people and their healers , was deserted . Its rooms will someday be renovated to look as modern as those in Coleman , but that Saturday there was very much a feeling of history . In room after room , crucifixes stared clown at mattresses . On the blackboard in the old nurses ' station someone had written " The End " in large letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hi Gang " sort of postcard from a nurse who had spent Christmas in the Virgin Islands . " I guess it just goes to show that it 's the people who make a hospital , and not the buildings , " said a nun as she tried to turn off a broken call light that was summoning a nonexistent nurse to a bare room .
