The river Ybbs rises in central Austria and winds north through the foothills of the Alps . It skirts the town of Lunz am Zee , flows south to G ? stling , curves up toward Waidhofen and then finally joins the Danube near the city of Ybbs. // Like many European countries , Austria is very protective of its fish , and rivers  --  good rivers at any rate  --  can not be fished without a license . All rivers fall into one of two categories  --  trout rivers and slow rivers  --  and two licenses are required to fish rivers in either category . The first , a Fischerkarte , is a government permit that is good for a year . The second , a club membership , is equivalent to a daily fishing fee . // The Ybbs costs 550 schillings a rod , or roughly $36 a day , more than most Americans pay for a year of fishing . But I did n't mind because I had long wanted to fish there . I was thrown , however , when the license clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather , asked me whether I wanted a " high-boot or low-boot section . " // " What ? " I asked , thinking I had misunderstood the German phrase . // " Low boot or high boot ? " he repeated , touching his calf , then moving his hand to his thigh . // " What 's the difference ? " // " The difference , " he said carefully , " is that you may wear high boots in one river section and low boots in another . " // " But what does it mean ? How are they different ? " // " The low-boot river is easier to fish and is slower . The high-boot river has more trees along its border . " // The difference still was n't quite clear to me , but I nodded and selected a low-boot section of the Ybbs . I paid my $36 , which , combined with the regional fishing card , ran my bill to approximately $60.1 asked the license clerk if the fishing was good . // " Ja , very good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your money back . If the river is too swollen , you just come back and we 'll give you a refund . " That seemed reasonable , and I thanked him and left . // I went home and picked up my wife , who was as excited as I about our expedition into the countryside . Although we had lived in Vienna for three months , we were not prepared for the beauty of the surrounding region . Mountains loomed beside the road , and green pastures were dotted with farmhouses . // We arrived in St. Leopold am Wald the night before my license became valid . Friends had recommended an inn in the center of the village , and I had phoned for reservations . Cowbells sounded as we climbed out of the car , and the chilly air smelled of laurel and summer fields . // We had dinner at the inn 's restaurant , which specialized in wild game . A man in lederhosen played an accordion and sang Austrian ballads , and after dinner the innkeeper gave us each a glass of schnapps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind from the mountains called to the inn . // The next morning I said goodbye to my wife , who planned to spend the day hiking , and drove past Waidhofen and the villages of Gstadt and Opponitz , until I picked up the Ybbs . I saw no fishermen . Instead I saw farmers riding tractors into their fields and women out early feeding chickens or hanging laundry . In the corner of every field I saw deer blinds , built like small tree houses six or seven feet above the ground . Each blind commanded a clear view of the spruce forests , from which deer emerged and browsed at dawn and sunset . // My license permitted me to fish between G ? stling and Lunz am Zee , a section extending about 15 kilometers . I parked midway between the two villages , not too far from a railroad crossing , and worked my way down to the river . // The Ybbs turned out to be about 30 yards wide , fast moving and clear . The water appeared to be five feet deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring melt . The water moved too swiftly to make upstream presentation feasible . I tied on a sinking Muddler Minnow , a deer-hair streamer that can be mistaken by a trout for a grasshopper or a sculpin minnow , and began to roll cast . // Back home in Rhode Island , I would have stepped into the water wearing chest-high waders . But here , with boots only ankle high , I had to stand on the bank and roll cast under clumps of maple and linden , and I was not graceful . I snagged a cast on the bushes behind me and rolled one directly into a submerged log . I lost the first Muddler , tied on another , lost that one on a willow sapling by the side of the river and then switched to a Royal Coachman streamer , because the Muddler seemed a bit too willing to take to the trees . // On my third cast with the Coachman I had a strike . It was very tentative , and at first I was n't sure if I had actually felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire pool , but nothing else happened . I brought in the line and cast again , this time making sure the fly drifted through the swirls at the bottom of the run . As sometimes happens with trout , I could sense the fish was going to hit an instant before it did . The strike was hard and fast . The trout took the streamer and shot off downstream , bent back and jumped . It jumped again before running straight away , back to the swirls . Playing the line by hand , I let the fish run until it weakened . I needed a minute or two to land the trout , a rainbow . // Austrian regulations prohibit taking rainbows before May 1 , so I released it . I moved down the bank and cast up and across , again making sure the fly would drift through the swirls . This time the fly was taken before it entered the spirals on either side of the main channel . At the first jump I saw I had a grayling . // I had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have hooked one here . I played the fish cautiously because even though it was no more than 10 inches long , its high sail-like dorsal fin seemed to make any turn more violent than a similar maneuver by other species of trout . I played the line by hand once again . The fish was dark under the water and beautiful . // As I landed it , I heard a voice behind me and turned to see a heavy , red-faced man walking across the field toward me . " Kontrolle , " he called . He pushed his lapel to one side , and I saw the insignia of the fishing club I belonged to , if only for the day . I would not have taken the man for a ranger . He looked like a guy who sometimes sits out in leftfield at American Legion games , a beer cooler by his lawn chair . // " Kontrolle , forellen trout kontrolle , " he said . // I released the grayling and dug into my fly jacket for the two licenses . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed him the licenses , and he inspected them . He wrote something on one and then asked if I had caught anything . // " Nothing to keep , " I told him . // He asked where I was from , and when I said the United States , he threw his hands apart to indicate the length of a fish and said , " Montana ! " He moved his hands a few inches farther apart and said , " Wyoming ! " Finally , with his arms open wide , he all but shouted , " Alaska . " // " Ja , Ja , " I said repeatedly , inordinately proud that I came from a land where such monsters are common . It was slow going but we established a bond . The ranger told me to move downstream about a quarter of a mile where the fishing was better . He left me , crossing the field again to his car . He waved as he got in . I waved back . // As I moved downstream , I did n't know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would be easier . Here at last was the low-boot section . The trees had been cut away . Below the three-foot bank was a beautiful stretch of ideal trout water . It ran in a steady flow , only occasionally doubling back on itself around large rocks . Natural pools formed everywhere . Under the glaze of sunlight , I saw trout holding their positions in the stream . // By noon I had caught about 15 fish . All of them were healthy and vibrant . An hour later , I stopped for a lunch of local cheese , fresh bread and beer . As I stood in the shade of a stand of birch , drinking a second beer , I could almost see the last of the snow melting on the mountains . // After lunch I worked downstream , and if anything , the fishing was too good to be challenging . I changed flies several times , attempting to see if the fish would be selective , but they rose to any enticement . The competition among the fish was so intense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Marabou , and dries  --  Duns , Wulffs and Quill Gordons . Almost all the trout were 10 to 12 inches long . I felt like Midas . // I drove back to the inn at St. Leopold . The owner met me at the door and led me into the kitchen . There the chef cleaned the trout , while the owner poured me a glass of schnapps . I selected the vegetables I wanted served with the trout , and the owner suggested a wine . // My wife returned from her hike around five , and by six we had showered and were ready for a meal . The trout were served beautifully , with small boiled potatoes , spinach and a white wine from the Wachau , an area outside of Vienna along the Danube . We ate and listened to the accordion player . Guests at a table next to us began singing an old ballad . It was cool enough to have a fire in the lounge , and someone lit one in a large fireplace that had been hung with antelopes ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time , but it was hard to stay awake . We went to sleep at nine , the sound of singing rising softly from several floors below us.
