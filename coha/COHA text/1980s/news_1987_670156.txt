Can a drama about a teen-age werewolf become a hit television series ? Fox Broadcasting Co. certainly hopes so . Tomorrow , Fox kicks off its second night of prime-time programming with " Werewolf , " the story of a handsome young man who is running away from the law because he periodically turns into a werewolf . " We think the show has breakthrough potential , essentially ( to be ) a hit , " says a Fox spokesman . Perhaps . But if the past is any guide , Fox ' s new Saturday night lineup , which eventually will also include three other new shows , faces an uphill battle . Fox ' s well-publicized first night of prime-time programming , on Sundays , has turned in disappointing ratings performances so far . And media executives say Saturday ratings may be even lower , as fewer young people  --  Fox ' s targeted audience  --  are at home on Saturday nights . " Sunday night hasn ' t worked satisfactorily so far , and you have to assume . . . that Saturday will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant and former programming executive for CBS Inc. and National Broadcasting Co . Concedes Jamie Kellner , Fox ' s president and chief operating officer : " It ' s going to be a long and difficult journey to convince the American people that there are four ( TV channel ) choices instead of three on the weekends . " The new shows from Fox will appear on the network ' s 113 affiliate stations reaching about 84% of all homes with TV sets . " The New Adventures of Beans Baxter , " which makes its debut July 18 , is a half-hour comedy about a high-school boy who is also a secret agent . July 18 is also the debut of " Karen ' s Song , " a half-hour comedy starring Patty Duke as a middle-aged woman dating a 28-year-old man . The following Saturday , the full lineup will be in place with the addition of " Down and Out in Beverly Hills , " a half-hour sitcom based on the movie . Fox initially had planned to introduce its Saturday lineup on May 30 . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a great disparity between the performance of our ( Sunday ) shows market to market , " says Mr. Kellner . " In some cities we needed more time " for Sunday shows to become established . But he adds that he is " delighted " with the overall performance of the Sunday lineup . Mr. Kellner apparently is easily delighted . Fox had guaranteed advertisers in its Sunday lineup a 6 rating nationally ; the actual rating has been only 3. 7 . ( One rating point equals 874 , 000 homes . ) Fox ' s lowest-rated program , " The Tracey Ullman Show , " starring the British actress and comedian , has only had about a 2. 9 rating nationally despite critical acclaim . " I don ' t think the American public has accepted her , " says Joel Siegel , executive vice president for television for Ted Bates Worldwide advertising . Even Fox ' s most popular show , " 21 Jump Street , " about undercover cops fighting high-school crime , has only garnered a 4. 3 rating . To put that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks , " West 57th Street , " had a 4. 1 rating for the week ended July 5 . ( The figures aren ' t exactly comparable ; " 21 Jump Street " reaches only about 84% of homes with television sets , while " West 57th Street " reaches virtually all homes with televisions . ) Fox ' s late-night talk show , " The Late Show , " has performed even worse than its Sunday entries . When Joan Rivers left the show as permanent host in May , after months of tension between her and Fox executives , ratings had slipped to 2. 5 from 3. 0 the previous October . However , since Ms. Rivers ' s departure , ratings have slipped even further , averaging only about 2 . Part of the problem with Fox ' s fourth network is that , of its 113 stations , only 18 are on VHF frequencies ; the remainder are UHF channels which are harder to find and which sometimes have very weak signals . As a result , " there ' s only a 50% awareness level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says Fox has spent $25 million so far on advertising and promotion , " and our budget is in excess of that next year . " Despite Fox ' s mixed record so far , advertisers remain interested in the fledgling network . One reason is that the cost to reach 1 , 000 Fox viewers is only about 75% of the cost to reach 1 , 000 established network viewers . Also , Fox ' s audience has the kind of demographic makeup that advertisers love : It is heavily populated by young adults who spend a lot of money on advertisers ' products . And , while the big-three networks are reportedly asking for some substantial increases in commercial prices for next year , Fox ' s prices are expected to stay the same or increase only slightly . Advertisers say a 30-second commercial spot on a Fox show will cost as little as $35 , 000 for next season . That ' s about a third of what a prime-time network spot typically costs and only about one-tenth the price of a spot on " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in , " says Marc Goldstein , senior vice president and director of network and programming for Ogilvy &; Mather New York , a unit of ad agency holding company Ogilvy Group Inc . He adds , however , that the increase is primarily attributable to the fact that next season Fox will have two nights of programming rather than one , and its programming will run for 12 months rather than six . Advertisers are also intrigued by Fox ' s efforts to " counterprogram , " or to deliberately run a show that is completely different from the networks ' offerings in a particular time slot . For example , " Werewolf , " which Fox describes as a half-hour horror show , is scheduled to run at 9 p. m . Eastern time against NBC ' s sitcom " The Golden Girls . " Fox has also stirred up advertiser interest because it has performed well in some markets , especially big cities like New York and Washington where it owns and operates stations . In Washington , " 21 Jump Street " has been the No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Mr. Kellner . " Married With Children " has regularly scored higher than one or two of the offerings on the three networks , he adds . In New York , some Fox programs have also garnered higher ratings than shows on the three networks . Mr. Kellner says that Fox ' s sale of advertising time for next season is " going sensationally . We have positioned ourselves below the networks . " He adds that all of the Sunday shows except the sitcom " Mr. President " have been renewed for next season . " Mr. President , " a late entry into the Sunday lineup , is expected to be renewed next week . Meanwhile , media executives say that Fox should slow down and digest before coming up with a third night of programming . Mr. Kellner says the network plans to introduce its third night by the second quarter of 1988 , but may put it off  --  the way it put off the second night  --  if it feels the audience isn ' t ready . " Our philosophy is to gradually roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework regarding timing , " he says . " We will learn to crawl before we walk , and walk before we run.
