My father drank . He drank as a gut-punched boxer gasps for breath , as a starving dog gobbles food ? compulsively , secretly , in pain and trembling . I use the past tense not because he ever quit drinking but because he quit living . That is how the story ends for my father , age sixty-four , heart bursting , body cooling , slumped and forsaken on the linoleum of my brother 's trailer . The story continues for my brother , my sister , my mother , and me , and will continue as long as memory holds . In the perennial present of memory , I slip into the garage or barn to see my father tipping back the flat green bottles of wine , the brown cylinders of whiskey , the cans of beer disguised in paper bags . His Adam 's apple bobs , the liquid gurgles , he wipes the sandy-haired back of a hand over his lips , and then , his bloodshot gaze bumping into me , he stashes the bottle or can inside his jacket , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we both pretend the moment has not occurred . " What 's up , buddy ? " he says , thick-tongued and edgy . " Sky 's up , " I answer , playing along . " And do n't forget prices , " he grumbles . " Prices are always up . And taxes . " In memory , his white 1951 Pontiac with the stripes down the hood and the Indian head on the snout lurches to a stop in the driveway ; or it is the 1956 Ford station wagon , or the 1963 Rambler shaped like a toad , or the sleek 1969 Bonneville that will do 120 miles per hour on straightaways ; or it is the robin's-egg-blue pickup , new in 1980 , battered in 1981 , the year of his death . He climbs out , grinning dangerously , unsteady on his legs , and we children interrupt our game of catch , our building of snow forts , our picking of plums , to watchin silence as he weaves past us into the house , where he drops into his overstuffed chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a cigarette he has left smoldering in the ashtray . All evening , until our bedtimes , we tiptoe past him , as past a snoring dragon . Then we curl fearfully in our sheets , listening . Eventually he wakes with a grunt , Mother slings accusations at him , he snarls back , she yells , he growls , their voices clashing . Before long , she retreats to their bedroom , sobbing -- not from the blows of fists , for he never strikes her , but from the force of his words . Left alone , our father prowls the house , thumping into furniture , rummaging in the kitchen , slamming doors , turning the pages of the newspaper with a savage crackle , muttering back at the late-night drivel from television . The roof might fly off , the walls might buckle from the pressure of his rage . Whatever my brother and sister and mother may be thinking on their own rumpled pillows , I lie there hating him , loving him , fearing him , knowing I have failed him . I tell myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly , an ache I must have caused by disappointing him somehow , a murderous ache I should he able to relieve by doing all my chores , earning A 's in school , winning baseball games , fixing the broken washer and the burst pipes , bringing in the money to fill his empty wallet . He would not hide the green bottles in his toolbox , would not sneak off to the barn with a lump under his coat , would not fall asleep in the daylight , would not roar and fume , would not drink himself to death , if only I were perfect . I am forty-four , and I know full well now that my father was an alcoholic , a man consumed by disease rather than by disappointment . What had seemed to me a private grief is in fact , of course , a public scourge . In the United States alone , some ten or fif-teen million people share his ailment , and behind the doors they slam in fury or disgrace , countless other children tremble . I comfort myself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an ice pack against a bruise . Other people have keener sources of grief : poverty , rac-ism , rape , war . I do not wish to com-pete to determine who has suffered most . I am only trying to understand the corrosive mixture of helplessness , responsibility , and shame that I learned to feel as the son of an alco-holic . I realize now that I did not cause my father 's illness , nor could I have cured it . Yet for all this grown-up knowledge , I am still ten years old , my own son 's age , and as that boy I struggle in guilt and confu-sion to save my father from ( - .1 pain . .... Aonsider a few of our synonyms for drunk : tipsy , tight , pickled , soused , and plowed ; stoned and stewed , lubricated and inebriated , juiced and sluiced ; three sheets to the wind , in your cups , out of your mind , under the table ; lit up , tanked up , wiped out ; besotted , blotto , bombed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or looped , boozy , woozy , fuddled , or smashed ; crocked and shit-faced , corked and pissed , snockered and sloshed . It is a mostly humorous lexicon , as the lore that deals with drunks ? in jokes and cartoons , in plays , films , and television skits ? is largely comic . Aunt Matilda nips elderberry winefrom the sideboard and burps politely during supper . Uncle Fred slouches to the table glassy-eyed , wearing a lampshade for a hat and murmuring , " Candy is dandy , but liquor is quicker . " Inspired by cocktails , Mrs. Somebody recounts the events of her day in a fuzzy dialect , while Mr. Somebody nibbles her ear and croons a bawdy song . On the sofa with Boyfriend , Daughter Somebody giggles , licking gin from her lips , and loosens the bows in her hair . Junior knocks back some brews with his chums at the Leopard Lounge and stumbles home to the wrong house , wonders foggily why he can not locate his pajamas , and crawls naked into bed with the ugliest girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wobbles to the nursery , where he vomits in Baby 's shoe . It is all great fun . But if in the audience you notice a few laughing faces turn grim when the drunk lurches onstage , do n't be surprised , for these are the children of alcoholics . Over thegrinning mask of Dionysus , the leering face of Bacchus , these children can not help seeing the bloated features of their own parents . Instead of laughing , they wince , they mourn . Instead of celebrating the drunk as one freed from constraints , they pity him as one enslaved . They refuse to believe in vino veritas , having seen their befuddled parents skid away from truth toward folly and oblivion . And so these children bite their lips until the lush staggers into the wings . My father , when drunk , was neither funny nor honest ; he was pathetic , frightening , deceitful . There seemed to be a leak in him somewhere , and he poured in booze to keep from draining dry . Like a torture victim who refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drop , not even in his last year , when . he seemed to be dissolving in alcohol before our very eyes . I never knew him to lie about anything , ever , except about this one ruinous fact . Drowsy , clumsy , unable to fix a bicyMEMOIR 69 cle tire , balance a grocery sack , or walk across a room , he was stripped of his true self by drink . In a matter of minutes , the contents of a bottle could transform a brave man into a coward , a buddy into a bully , a gifted athlete and skilled carpenter and shrewd businessman into a bumbler . No dictionary of synonyms for drunk would soften the anguish of watching our prince turn into a frog . Father 's drinking became the family secret . While growing up , we children never breathed a word of it beyond the four walls of our house . To this day , my brother and sister rarely mention it , and then only when I press them . I did not confess the ugly , bewildering fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to . Recently , on the seventh anniversary of my father 's death , I asked my mother if she ever spoke of his drinking to friends . " No , no , never , " she replied hastily . " I could n't hear for anyone to know . " The secret bores under the skin , gets in the blood , into the bone , and stays there . Long after you have supposedly been cured of malaria , the fever can flare up , the tremors can shake you . So it is with the fevers of shame . You swallow the bitter quinine of knowledge , and you learn to feel pity and compassion toward the drinker . Yet the shame lingers and , because of it , anger . For a long stretch of my childhood we lived on a military reservation in Ohio , an arsenal where bombs were stored underground in hunkers and vintage airplanes burst into flames and unstable artillery shells boomed nightly at the dump . We had the feeling , as children , that we played within a minefield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father was drinking , the house , too , became a minefield . The least bump could set off either parent . The more he drank , the more obsessed Mother became with stopping him . She hunted for bottles , counted the cash in his wallet , sniffed at his breath . Without meaning to snoop , we children blundered left and right into damning evidence . On afternoons when he came home from worksober , we flung ourselves at him for hugs and felt against our ribs the telltale lump in his coat . In the ham we tumbled on the hay and heard beneath our sneakers the crunch of broken glass . We tugged open a drawer in his workbench , looking for screwdrivers or crescent wrenches , and spied a gleaming six-pack among the tools . Playing tag , we darted around the house just in time to see him sway on the rear stoop and heave a finished bottle into the woods . In his good-night kiss we smelled the cloying sweetness of Clorets , the mints he chewed to camouflage his dragon 's breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodore Roethke 's lines about his own father : Such waltzing was hard , terribly hard , for with a boy 's scrawny arms l was trying to hold my tipsy father upright . For years , the chief source of those incriminating bottles and cans was a grimy store a mile from us , a cinderblock place called Sly 's , with two gas pumps outside and a mangy dog asleep in the window . Inside , on rusty metal shelves or in wheezing coolers , you could find pop and Popsicles , cigarettes , potato chips , canned soup , raunchy postcards , fishing gear , Twinkies , wine , and beer . When Father drove anywhere on errands , ? Mother would send us along as guards , warning us not to let him out of our sight , And so with one or more of us on board , Father would cruise up to Sly 's , pump a dollar 's worth of gas or plump the tires with air , and then , telling us to wait in the car , he would head for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us go with you ! " " No , " he answered . " I 'll be back in two shakes . " " Please ! " " No ' . " he roared . " Do n't you budge or jerk a knot in your tails ! " So we stayed put , kicking the seats , while he ducked inside . Often , when he had parked the car at a careless angle , we gazed in through the windowroads and in the country schools and cramped Methodist churches of Ohio and Tennessee , I never heard the word alcoholic , never happened across it in books or magazines . In the nearby towns , there were no addiction-treatment programs , no community mental-health centers , no Alcoholics Anonymous chapters , no therapists . Left alone with our grievous secret , we had no way of understanding Father 's drinking except as an act of will , a deliberate folly or cruelty , a moral weakness , a sin . He drank because he chose to , pure and simple . Why our father , so playful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and punish his family we could not fathom . Our neighborhood was high on the Bible , and the Bible was hard on drunkards . " Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and valiant men in mixing strong drink , " wrote Isaiah . " The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink , they are confused with wine , they err in vision , they stumble in giving judgment . For all tables are full of vomit , no place is without filthiness . " We children had seen those fouled tables at the local truck stop where the notorious boozers hung out , our father occasionally among them . " Wine and new wine take away the understanding , " declared the prophet Hosea . We had also seen evidence of that in our father , who could multiply seven-digit numbers in his head when sober but when drunk could not help us with fourth-grade math . Proverbs warned : " Do not look at wine when it is red , when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adder . Your eyes will see strange things , and your mind utter perverse things . " Woe , woe . Dismayingly often , these biblical drunkards stirred up trouble for their own kids . Noah made fresh wine after the flood , drank too much of it , fell asleep without any clothes on , and was glimpsed in the buff by his son Ham , whom Noah promptly cursed . In one passage it was so shocking we had to read it under our blankets with flashlights ? the patriarch Lot fell down drunk and slept with his daughters . The sins of the fathers set their children 's teeth on edge . Our ministers were fond of quoting St. Paul 's pronouncement that drunkards would not inherit the kingdom of God . These grave preachers assured us that the wine referred to in the Last Supper was in fact grape juice . Bible and sermons and hymns combined to give us the impression that Moses should have brought down from the mountain another stone tablet , bearing the Eleventh Commandment : Thou shalt not drink . The scariest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one about the lunatic and the swine . We knew it by heart : When Jesus climbed out of his boat one day , this lunatic came charging up from the graveyard , stark naked and filthy , frothing at the mouth , so violent that he broke the strongest chains . Nobody would go near him . Night and day for years , this madman had been wailing among the tombs and bruising himself with stones . Jesus took one look at him and said , " Come out of the man , you unclean spirits ! " for he could see that the lunatic was possessed by demons . Meanwhile , some hogs were conveniently rooting nearby . " If we have to come out , " begged the demons , " at least let us go into those swine . " Jesus agreed , the unclean spirits entered the hogs , and the hogs raced straight off a cliff and plunged into a lake . Hearing the story in Sunday school , my friends thought mainly of the pigs . ( How big a splash did they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought of the redeemed lunatic , who bathed himself and put on clothes and calmly sat at the feet of Jesus , restored ? so the Bible said ? to " his right mind . " When drunk , our father was clearly in his wrong mind . He became a stranger , as fearful to us as any graveyard lunatic , not quite frothing at the mouth but fierce enough , quick-tempered , explosive ; or else he grew maudlin and weepy , which frightened us nearly as much . In my boyhood despair , I reasoned that maybe he was n't to blame for turning into an ogre : Maybe , like the lunatic , he was possessed by demons . If my father was indeed possessed , who would exorcise him ? If he was a sinner , who would save him ? If he was ill , who would cure him ? If he suffeted , who would ease his pain ? Not ministers or doctors , for we could not bring ourselves to confide in them ; not the neighbors , for we pretended they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussed and pleaded but could not budge him ; not my brother and sister , who were only kids . That left me . It did not matter that 1 , too , was only a child , and a bewildered one at that . 1 could not excuse myself . 0 n first reading a description of help but see my own father 's mutation from sober to drunk . Even today , knowing better , I am attracted by the demonic theory of drink , for when recall my father 's transformation , the emergence of his ugly second self , I find it easy to believe in being possessed by unclean spirits . We never knew which version of Father would come home from work , the true or the tainted , nor could we guess how far down the slope toward cruelty he would slide . How far a man could slide we gauged by observing our back-road neighbors the out-of-work miners who had dragged their families to our corner of Ohio from the desolate hollows of Appalachia , the tightfisted farmers , the surly mechanics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , whiskey-soaked Mr. Jenkins , who beat his wife and kids so hard we could hear their screams from the road . There was Mr. Lavo the wino , who fell asleep smoking time and again , until one night his disgusted wife bundled up the children and went outside and left him in his easy chair to burn ; he awoke on his own , staggered out coughing into the yard , and pounded her flat while the children looked on and the shack turned to ash . There was the truck driver , Mr. Sampson , who tripped over his son 's tricycle one night while drunk and got mad , jumped into his semi , and drove away , shifting through the dozen gears , and never came back . We saw the bruised children of these fathers clump onto our school bus , we saw the abandoned children huddle in the pews at church , we saw the stunned and battered mothers begging for help at our doors . Our own father never beat us , and I do n't think he beat Mother , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more terrible in His rage . Eyes blazing , voice booming , Father would pull out his belt and swear to give us a whipping , but he never followed through , never needed to , because we could imagine it so vividly . He shoved us , pawed us with the back of his hand , not to injure , just to clear a space . I can see him grabbing Mother by the hair as she cowers on a chair during a nightly quarrel . He twists her neck hack until she gapes up at him , and then he lifts over her skull a glass quart bottle of milk , the milk spilling down his forearm , and he yells at her , " Say just one more word , one goddamn word , and I 'll shut you up ? " I feat she will prick him with her sharp tongue , but she is terrified into silence , and so am I , and the leaking bottle quivers in the air , and milk seeps through the red hair of my father 's uplifted arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head jerked hack , the club raised . When the drink made him weepy , Father would pack , kiss each of us children on the head , and announce from the front door that he was moving out . " Where to ? " we demanded , fearful each time that he would leave for good , as Mr. Simpson had roared away for good in his diesel truck . " Someplace where I wo n't get hounded every minute , " Father would answer , his jaw quivering . He stabbed a look at Mother , who might say , " Do n't run into the ditch before you get there , " or ' Good riddance , " and then he would slink away . Mother watched him go with arms crossed over her chest , her face closed like the lid on a box of snakes . We children bawled . Where could he go ? To the truck stop , that den of iniquity ? To one of those dark , ratty flophouses in town ? Would he wind up sleeping under a railroad bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mummied in rags like the bums we had seen on our trips to Cleveland and Chicago ? We bawled and bawled , wondering if he would ever come back . He always did come back , a day or a week later , but each time there was a sliver less of him . n Kafka 's Metamorphosis , which opens famously with Gregor Samsa waking up from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed into an insect , Gregor 's family keep reassuring themselves that things will be just fine again " when he comes back to us . " Each time alcohol transformed our father we held out the same hope , that he would really and truly come hack to us , our authentic father , the tender and playful and competent man , and then all things would be fine . We had grounds for such hope . After his tear-ful departures and chapfallen returns , he would sometimes go weeks , even months , without drinking . Those were glad times . Every day without the furtive glint of bottles , every meal without a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such bliss might go on forever . Mother was fooled by such a hope all during the forty-odd years she knew Greeley Ray Sanders . Soon after she met him in a Chicago delicatessen on the eve of World War II and fell for his butter-melting Mississippi drawl and his wavy red hair , she learned that he drank heavily . But then so did a lot of men . She would soon coax or scold him into breaking the nasty habit . She would point our to him how ugly and foolish it was , this bleary drinking , and then he would quit . He refused to quit during their engagement , however , still refused during the first years of marriage , refused until my older sister came along . The shock of fatherhood sobered him , and he remained soberthrough my birth at the end of the war and right on through until we moved in 1951 to the Ohio arsenal . The arsenal had more than its share of alcoholics , drug addicts , and other varieties of escape artists . There 1 turned six and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just in time to see my father begin sneaking swigs in the garage . He sobered up again for most of a year at the height of the Korean War , to celebrate the birth of my brother . But aside from that dry spell , his only breaks from drinking before I graduated from high school were just long enough to raise and then dash our hopes . Then during the fall of my senior year ? the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis , when it seemed that the nightly explosions at the munitions dump and the nightly rages in. our household might spread to engulf the globe ? Father collapsed . His liver , kidneys , and heart all conked out . The doctors saved him , but only by a hair . He stayed in the hospital for weeks , going through a withdrawal so terrible that Mother would not let us visit him . If he wanted to kill himself , the doctors solemnly warned him , all he had to do was hit the bottle again . One binge would finish him . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next fifteen years . It was an answer to prayer , Mother said , it was a miracle . I believe it was a reflex of fear , which he sustained over the years through courage and pride . He knew a man could die from drink , for his brother Roscoe had . We children never laid eyes on doomed Uncle Roscoe , but in the stories Mother told us he became a fairy-tale figure , like a boy who took the wrong turn in the woods and was gobbled up by the wolf . The fifteen-year dry spell came to an end with Father 's retirement in the spring of 1978 . Like many men , he gave up his identity along with his job . One day he was a boss at the factory , with a brass plate on his door and a reputation to uphold ; the next day he was a nobody at home . He and Mother were leaving Ontario , the last of the many places to which his job had carried them , and they were moving to a new house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mississippi , Father sold Coca-Cola during dances while the moonshiners peddled their brew in the parking lot ; as a young blade , he fought in bars and in the ring , winning a state Golden Gloves championship ; he gambled at poker , hunted pheasant , raced motorcycles and cars , played semiprofessional baseball , and , along with all his buddies ? in the Black Cat Saloon , behind the cotton gin , in the woods he drank hard . It was a perilous youth to dream of recovering . After his final day of work , Mother drove on ahead with a car full of begonias and violets , while Father stayed behind to oversee the packing , When the van was loaded , the sweaty movers broke open a six-pack and offered him a beer . " Let 's drink to retirement ! " they crowed . " Let 's drink to freedom ! to fishing ! hunting ! loafing ! Let 's drink to a guy who 's going home ! " At least I imagine some such words , for that is all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand trembling in midair to Father 's treacherous stomping ground , my wife and I visited them in Mississippi with our four-year-old daughter . Mother had been too distraught to warn me about the return of the demons . So when I climbed out of the car that bright July morning and saw my father napping in the hammock , I felt uneasy , and when he lurched upright and blinked his bloodshot eyes and greeted us in a syrupy voice , I was hurled back into childhood . " What 's the matter with Papaw ? " our daughter asked . " Nothing , " I said . " Nothing ! " Like a child again , I pretended not to see him in his stupor , and behind my phony smile I grieved . On that visit and on the few that remained before his death , once again I found bottles in the workbench , bottles in the woods . Again his hands shook too much for him to run a saw , to make his precious miniature furniture , to drive straight down back roads . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in jail , in the treatment center . Again he shouted and wept . Again he lied . " I never touched a drop , " he swore . " Your mother 's making it up . " I no longer fancied I could reason with the men whose names I found on the bottles ? Jim Beam , Jack Daniel 's ? but I was able now to recall the cold statistics about alcoholism : ten million victims , fifteen million , twenty . And yet , in spite of my age , I reacted in the same blind way as I had in childhood , by vainly seeking to erase through my efforts whatever drove him to drink . 1 worked on their place twelve and sixteen hours a day , in the swelter of Mississippi summers , digging ditches , running electrical wires , planting trees , mowing grass , building sheds , as though what nagged at him was some list of chores , as though by taking his worries upon my shoulders I could redeem him . I was flung back into boyhood , acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only I were perfect . I failed of perfection ; he succeeded in dying . To the end , he considered himself not sick but sinful . " Do you want to kill yourself ? " I asked him . " Why not ? " he answered . " Why the hell not ? What 's there to save ? " To the end , he would not speak about his feelings , would not or could not give a name to the beast that was devouring him . In silence , he went rushing off the cliff . Unlike the biblical swine , however , he left behind a few of the demons to haunt his children . Life with him and the loss of him twisted us into shapes that will be familiar to other sons and daughters of alcoholics . My brother became a rebel , my sister retreated into shyness , I played the stalwart and dutiful son who would hold the family together . If my father was unstable , I would be a rock . If he squandered money on drink , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only when drunk ? I would not let myself weep at all . if he roared at the Little League umpire for calling my pitches balls , I would throw nothing but strikes . Watching him flounder and rage , I came to dread the loss of control . I would go through life without making anyone mad . I vowed never to put in my mouth or veins any chemical that would banish my everyday self . I would never make a scene , never lash out at the ones I loved , never hurt a soul . Through hard work , relentless work , I would achieve something dazzling in the classroom , on the bas-ketball court , in the science lab , in the pages of books ? and my achievement would distract the world 's eyes from his humiliation . I would become a worthy sacrifice , and the smoke of my burning would please God , It is far easier to recognize these twists in my character than to undo them . Work has become an addiction for me , as drink was an addiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a placard for the wall : WORKAHOLIC . The labor is endless and futile , for I can no more redeem myself through work than I could redeem my father . I still panic in the face of other people 's anger , because his drunken temper was so terrible . I shrink from causing sadness or disappointment even to strangers , as though I were still concealing the family shame . I still notice every twitch of emotion in those faces around me , having learned as a child to read the weather in faces , and I blame myself for their least pang of unhappiness or anger . In certain moods I blame myself for everything . Guilt burns like acid in my veins . Iam moved to write these pages sponsible ; he feels there must be something he can do to spring me from depression , to fix my life . And that crushing sense of responsibility is exactly what I felt at the age of ten in the face of my father 's drinking . My son wonders if I , too , am possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light what eats at me ? the fear , the guilt , the shame ? so that my own children may be spared . I still shy away from nightclubs , from bars , from parties where the solvent is alcohol . My friends puzzle over this , but it is no more peculiar than for a man to shy away from the lions ' den after seeing his father torn apart . I took my own first drink at the age of twenty-one , half a glass of burgundy . I knew the odds of my becoming an alcoholic were four times higher than for the children of nonalcoholic fathers . So 1 sipped warily . I still do once a week , perhaps , a glass of wine , a can of beer , nothing stronger , nothing more . I listen for the turning of a key in my brain .
