THE ANNOTATED HUCKLEBERRY FINN , edited , with an introduction , notes and bibliography by Michael Patrick Hearn . Illustrated . Clarkson Potter . 378 pp. $25 . Here is another publishing event comparable to the recent reissuing of " Moby Dick " for which we must be grateful . We are grateful . Mark Twain ' s wonderful and , yes , complicated novel was first published in 1884 . Twain spent seven years on it and when it was done he said , " Modesty compels me to say it is rattling good . " He was right . " Huckleberry Finn " is an extended monologue on the subject of irrationality . It is turbulent , intense , unstoppable , often absurd , and to an incredible point fraught with coincidence . There is no sense of doom or blood madness as in Faulkner , just a southern imagination festering with the word nigger flaunted twice a page . Dialect , dialect . Different kinds . And fools . It is about surviving , a subject that has been an American novelistic favorite since Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comics all the way down to the characters of Joseph Heller and Thomas Pynchon . Its most used adjective is lonesome . That ' s what people were in the 19th century and are in the 20th , which is part of the book ' s undeniable attraction , and so appealing is it that we call it a classic . Well , yes it is . Though it ' s no " Oresteia . " Huck and Jim ( the nigger ) floating down the Mississippi is a captivating romance . Yet there are questions . This is literature because the story is enthrallingly told , except that the end ( and if I have to tell you what it is why are you reading this ! ) will not wash and would be given plaudits only by the Hannibal , Mo. , Daily Bugle . There are questions too about Mark Twain , the dichotomized Mr. Clemens . And about American life . Our self-deluding notions of equality , for instance . There is no equality in " Huckleberry Finn . " The nigger Jim is by far a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke ( whites ) who are dreadful specimens , but Jim must stay " tied up " on the raft while the other two are off fleecing the feckless citizens of whatever town they have landed at as they float south . As a political concept democracy is theoretically intended to mean that a portion of equality is involved . But equality is not an idea that penetrates " Huckleberry Finn . " Tom Sawyer with his self- serving romanticism about " saving " Jim ( Tom shows up in the last few pages ) is not one of nature ' s noblemen . He is a boob . Huck is a realist who is not exactly driven mad by Tom ' s absurd schemes . He should have shoved Tom into the Mississippi and taken Jim north ( to freedom ) on his own , but he lacked the confidence that comes with class , or for what passed for it in Missouri back aways . Of course , as the whole world knows , Huck ' s adventures turned out all right , and because of his love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a profession of annotation , to which I don ' t object , because so , in a way , do I. This is a lovely book . You don ' t have to read the annotations , or even the long introduction , though all of this material is interesting . And in spite of the steep price it is worth every word .
