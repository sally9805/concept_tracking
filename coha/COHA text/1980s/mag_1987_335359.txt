Skeptics already call it the " lame-duck summit " because so many of the participants are in the waning stages of their elected tenures . There is also worry about lameness of another kind , a fear that the heads of the world 's leading industrial democracies may be powerless to make the kind of daring compromises demanded by a perilous imbalance in world trade and by the threat of global recession . Indeed , there are plenty of signs that a gondola ride through troubled waters lies ahead for the leaders of the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada when they gather in Venice for their 13th annual economic summit next week. * <P> The most frustrated leader of all may be Ronald Reagan , who is hobbled by the Iranscam tangle and the increasing welter of problems arising from the U.S. 's foreign and domestic indebtedness . Not only the President but also the U.S. itself are widely seen as weaker abroad , a perception that is reflected in a declining American ability to lead the way on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major challenges of the summit : How can allies long accustomed to U.S. leadership find solutions to their economic problems at a time when the U.S. is becoming , at best , first among equals ? <P> The danger of coming away with no answer to that question , however , may prove to be the best spur to productive talks at the three-day session . The No. 1 worry for the seven leaders is the rising potential for global recession along with a painful end to five years of sustained economic growth . To help prolong that expansion , the leaders must try to make stronger commitment to resist the lure of protectionism , which is beginning to cast a dangerous pall over world trade . Another summit priority will be taking further steps to ease the international debt crisis , which is simmering once again with the decision by Citicorp and other big U.S. banks to set aside billions of dollars for anticipated Third World loan losses . <P> The low expectations attendant on the Venice gathering are in sharp contrast to the high hopes that preceded last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which President Reagan cheerfully reviewed as the " most successful of the six I have attended , " Treasury Secretary James Baker helped to win endorsement of an ambitious plan to control the volatile relationship between the U.S. dollar and other currencies through tighter coordination of economic policies ( see box ) . The agreement was easy to reach , but the goal proved difficult to accomplish : despite a spate of follow-up meetings among economic leaders , market forces sent the dollar on a roller-coaster plunge in relation to the Japanese yen and the West German mark .
