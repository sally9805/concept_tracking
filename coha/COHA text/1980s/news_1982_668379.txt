By Brian F. Murphy Innsbruck , Austria - In Tyrol , a local adage professes that Austria has a ceiling . Austria , they say , terminates at 1000 meters above the sea . Any point higher than the imaginary border is no longer part of the nation crushed between Germany and Italy . Above 1000 meters , it is the Alps . Indeed , the Alps are a geographic paradox . A few hundred meters in elevation can nullify a century of technological progress . A mountain farmer can be gouging open a field with an iron plow and oxen team and be in sight of power lines and the high speed Austrian autobahn . Literally , a hiker can spend a day strolling through an isolated glacier and return to town for an early dinner . The Alps , here , are accessible . To everyone . Without question , the best - and many times the only way - to see the Alps is by foot . Nearly every village in Tyrol , the state which encompasses most of the Austrian Alps , coordinate daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tours offered by many mountain hiking groups , it is possible for even the most sedentary individuals to enjoy a walk above the timberline . For visitors , the center for alpine hiking is Innsbruck , the largest city in Tyrol . The Innsbruck Mountaineering Program , initiated between local alpineclubs and Innsbruck tourist officials , was created in 1974 in an attempt to dispell the intimidating feeling most visitors have toward the Alps . The notion that the Alps are beautiful to gaze at but treacherous to touch is consistently disproved at Innsbruck . The mountaineering program offers 20 tours . The most gentle , a two-hour hike through meadows flecked with the deep indigo buds of native gentien and red alpine roses , is complemented by relatively strenuous hikes along glacier- scarred slopes and into bogs of stunted shrubs , lichen and wild - quite edible - berries . Except for the most challenging tours , sneakers or standard walking shoes are acceptable . In Innsbruck , and nearly every Tyrolean village , hiking shoes and walking sticks can be rented for a nominal fee , usually about $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , participants in the mountaineering program are taken by bus from the Kongreshaus , a modern downtown convention center , to Iglis , a medieval hamlet located on a plateau above Innsbruck . Each group of hikers , accompanied by a certified mountain tour guide , is desposited at the trail head which corresponds to their tour . Following the hike , return transportation is provided by a free bus . However a more pleasant journey back to the city is the 30-minute voyage on the " Igler , " a narrow gauge steam train which meanders between Igls and Innsbruck several times daily . A guide boarding the bus in Innsbruck merely shrugged when questioned on the severity of a particular hike by several members of a Scottish walking group . " Moderate , " he said , elongating each syllable for emphasis . I decided to stay with the Scots . Leaving Igls , our tour followed a path carved deep into a steep slope . The rooftops of Innsbruck and the cloudy green ribbon of the Inn River were visible through breaks in the dense forest which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were led up a narrow incline which opened into a series of small farms . After a light lunch , we rambled through the fields back to Igls , stopping occasionally to pick a handful of strawberries . The number of hikers in each tour is largely contingent on the weather and the difficulty of the trip . Normally , the shorter , easier hikes attract nearly two dozen participants . The lengthy tours are usually conducted with less than 10 people , including a guide . The mountaineering program is provided at no cost to visitors who stay in Innsbruck more than three days , yet the hikes are available to anyone at a small charge . The program ' s motto - " Take to the mountains , and come back safe and sound " - is dutifully practiced by the hiking tour guides . Each guide actively encourages hikers to remain in a tight pack , and re- strains individuals possessed with an inordinate curiosity toward areas off the designated trail . Frequent rest periods are also practiced during the hikes , which are gratefully appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined conversationalists . A guide can chat endlessly on the variety of alpine flora , and easily transgress into a verbal essay on the distillation of schnopps . A favorite tale of the Innsbruck mountain guides concerns a topic of considerable local pride . In 1819 , a small band of farmers lead by Andreas Hofer , armed with only pitchforks , hoes and a few muskets , resisted a seige by the Napoleonic army in tghe ridges around Igls . Curiously , each guide has a unique rendition of the battle events , which slightly embellishes most historical accounts . Despite the imposing height of the Alps , hikers consistently stumble upon amenities which they thought were left behind in the valleys . Remote is a wordrarely used in reference to the Alps . With the recent increase in ski lift construction , restaurants , lodges and inns now flourish in areas which were previously considered wilderness . The Gastof Netererboden , a 600-year- old farm house converted to a restaurant , is typical of the unexpected pleasures found in the Alps . Nearly lost in a grove of Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the midway stop for several tours . Before dining on bacon dumplings and sauerkraut , a local specialty , hikers can relish potent Tyrolean beer and homemade schnopps flavored with wild roots and berries . Like the rest of Austria , restaurant prices are remarkably reasonable . A three course lunch - including soup and an exceedingly rich dessert - costs approximately $5 . Lunches at the Gastof Nattererboden are occasionally punctuated by the appearance of a rotund man , half covered by a grease spotted apron , who enjoys card tricks and brief dances with unsuspecting female patrons . And he ' s the cook . Albert Oswald , a renown European chef with numerous Parisian culinary awards , exemplifies the boisterous lifestyle of the Alps , which derives mischievous enjoyment in temporarily converting rather staid visitors . Oswald beams as a slightly intoxicated British tourist makes a first attempt at yoddling . For hikers preferring solitude , wandering alone in the Alps is possible . In fact , it ' s difficult to become lost . Nearly every valley has at least one village , and each village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently melted - between mid-April and late May - the clientele of the ski lifts becomes hikers . Few trials ascend the mountains from the base , therefore hikers are carried to the high elevations by lift . Because of the nearly unbelievable number of ski lifts which scale the Austrial Slps , it is completely possible to spend an entire day hiking and never lose sight of a ski lift providing downhill transportation . Most chairlifts carry hikers for approximately $1 . Prices for gondolas range between $2 to $3 . To equate United States and Austrian ski areas is possible . Unlike the expansive US ski slopes with acres of parking areas and dozens of retail ski shops , the Alpine areas are unpretentious . Most lifts in the Alps are constructed on natural passages up the mountains . Hikers seeking wilderness will find their quest aided , not spoiled , by the ski lifts . There is also no difficulty in spending the night above the timberline . Alpine huts , plentifully scattered throughout the entire Tyrol region , are the traditional accommodations for local mountaineering groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by foreign visitors . The huts , efficiently maintained by the Austrial Alpine Society , are similar to a rustic ski lodge and found at predetermined locations - usually a three to four-hour hike - along every major hiking trail in the Alps . Each hut is unique . Many provide only spartan accommodations - usually a simple table and chairs , fireplace and woodstove . Other huts resemble hotels , with an innkeeper arranging rooms and a full restaurant serving meals . Reservations are required at the more luxurious huts , but no one is ever turned away from a full hut . The policy is not simply alpine etiquette . It was created with respect for the unpredictable mountain weather . Even in mid- summer , the weather in the higher elevation can degenerate from a cloudless sky to a snowstorm in half a day . A section of floor may be a welcome haven during an approaching storm . The unattended huts are more common . Prior to beginning a hike , keys for the surrounding huts can be obtained through the local Alpine Society chapter . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file your proposed route with local alpine officials . Because of the changeable weather , tent camping , while not prohibited , is emphatically discouraged . Prices for an overnight stay at a hut range from $2 to $3 for Alpine Society members , and $4 to $5 for non-members . Membership can be easily attained by writing the Alpine Society in Innsbruck . Mayrhofen , a relatively large village in the Ziller Valley near the Brenner Pass , is the base for many hut hopping excursions . To reach the alpine region , a gondola near the center of the village carries hikers to the Penkenjoch Summit , which provides a panoramic view of the Tyrolean peaks and the northern Dolomite Range in Italy . On windless days , a melody of cowbells can be heard echoing from the valley . Near the Penkenjoch summit , a hearty sauerkraut dish is served at a small restaurant named Viori , which translates to Victoria , the hostess . Garnished with knockwurst , the sauerkraut is mixed with roux , a thick white sauce . Like many who are apt to overindulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penkenjoch . The trail from the summit to Mayrhofen is well marked , but tedious . After seemingly endless switch backs , the trail eventually ends near a foot bridge about a mile from the village . The frigid water of the Ziller River , which runs through the center of the valley , however , is a pleasant reward for aching feet . A popular hut hopping trip begins at Penkenjoch , where hikers take the Katzenmoos ski lift to Vorderlanersbach , at the base of the Tuxer valley . Hikers normally spend two days walking through the string of mountain villages to reach Hintertux , the training site for the United States and Austrian ski teams . In Kitzbuehel , near the center of Tyrol , I visited a series of huts several miles from the starting gate of the Hanenkamp , the precipitous downhill ski run where Austrian hero Franz Klamer won a gold medal in the 1976 winter Olympic games . The huts we discovered were well-insulated cabins , nearly engulfed with cut firewood . Inside , the multi-lingual graffitti served as both an unofficial guest register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps can easily be negotiated without a guide , most native Tyroleans have spent their entire life in one village and are bursting with information on the immediate area . While a travel brochure can relate that many of the hiking trails were carved by Italian prisoners during World War II , only a guide can recall how local girls used to smuggle home-brewed beer to the workers on their lunch break . The guides are also well versed in practical suggestions ; such as which snow ledges are likely to collapse under the summer sun and can distinguish between which mountain streams are safe to drink and what ones had experienced close contact with an excessively fertile cow pasture . If , as many Tyroleans insist , Austria has a 1000 meter ceiling , then it ' s possible to hike in the world ' s most picturesque attic . The Alps .
