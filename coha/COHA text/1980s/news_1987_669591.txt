Despite Iran ' s acquisition of Silkworm missiles from China , Gulf shipping is in no greater danger now than it has been since 1984 when Iraq began its so-called tanker war . Iraq has been responsible for seventy percent of the attacks on Gulf shipping in its effort to strangle Iran economically and internationalize the war . So far , Iran has not fallen into this trap. // Despite serious economic hardships caused by Iraqi bombing and the Saudi oil price war last year , Iran has not interfered with the passage of ships through the Strait of Hormuz . It has responded to Iraq ' s naval warfare by searching ships suspected of carrying war materiel to Iraq . Iran has also been careful not to provoke the United States and has neither seized nor attacked any US ships ; Iran has done both to Soviet ships. // // Thus the US decision to increase its military presence in the Persian Gulf has not been prompted primarily by a desire to protect shipping ; it results from a basic change in US policy towards the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tried to achieve two seemingly conflicting objectives in the Gulf war . On the one hand , it wants to prevent Iraq ' s collapse and to protect Persian Gulf Arabs against any potential Iranian threat . On the other hand , the US has tried to achieve these goals while preventing a close Soviet-Iranian relationship and keeping open the option of being reconciled to Iran someday. // Yet there has always been a school of thought , inside and outside the US government , that has favored more active and unquestioned support for Iraq , even at the risk of foreclosing future options with Iran . Since the debacle of the ill-conceived and ill-executed sale of arms to Iran , proponents of the Iraqi option have been in the ascendant. // Kuwait ' s request to the US to reflag its ships gave proponents of the Iraqi option a further chance to show US commitment to the Gulf Arabs and reassure them that the US has foreclosed any dealings with Iran for the foreseeable future . This group also believes that a clear show of US support for Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval presence in the Persian Gulf , will bolster Iraq ' s morale and help prevent an Iranian victory. // There is nothing wrong with Washington ' s trying to reassure its Arab allies and prevent Iraq ' s collapse . Yet how far is the US willing to go to achieve these goals ? Are the costs worth any potential gains ? These questions lead to two more : Does the US want to become directly involved in the war , going as far as to attack Iran militarily ? And how strong must a US military attack be to have a significant impact on the course of the war ? // Reflagging Kuwaiti ships brings the US perilously close to a state of active belligerency . Kuwait is not neutral in the Iran-Iraq war . It supports Iraq financially and is a principal conduit of war materiel . Iraq has even used Kuwaiti territory for attacks against Iran , leading to Iranian complaints at the United Nations. // More important , US protection for Kuwaiti ships might not deter Iran . And an Iranian attack on a US vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident - would require a US military response , because of domestic pressures and the negative impact that inaction would have on US credibility and prestige. // Yet a mild US military riposte might not have much effect . After all , Iran has been taking a bad beating from the Iraqis . A mild response that did not eliminate its naval forces or oil installations might even embolden Iran. // Furthermore , even a mild US attack would delay US-Iranian reconciliation for years , regardless of who rules in Iran . It would strengthen those elements in Iran who argue for patching up differences with the USSR - including the question of Afghanistan - and moving closer to the Soviets and the East Europeans . A mild US response would also not affect the course of the Gulf war , because Iraq ' s lack of success has not stemmed from Iran ' s military superiority. // By contrast , a massive US strike against Iran would have one of three consequences . It might lead to chaos and the collapse of central power in Iran . To be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a bad thing , because it could lead to a change of government in Iran and the possible installation of a pro-US government that would sign a peace treaty with Iraq. // More likely , however , Iran would plunge into turmoil and civil war that would create opportunities for the USSR to determine Iran ' s fate . No doubt , the USSR prefers to avoid a superpower confrontation in the Persian Gulf . But it is foolish to think that Moscow would stand by and watch the US reassert control over Iran by military means or let the US incorporate Khuzestan into a US-sponsored Arab coalition . The Soviets have not abandoned the 1921 treaty that allows them to move troops into Iran . Under chaotic circumstances , Iran would not be able to oppose Soviet military action . Indeed , some elements in Iran might invite the Soviets in. // Alternatively , a US strike against Iran might not cause it to collapse politically . But Iran might turn to the USSR for help . Kuwait has already used the Soviet factor in dragging the US into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kuwait has apparently put pressure on Pakistan to be more flexible on the Afghanistan issue . Iran , which has two million Afghan refugees and common borders with both Pakistan and Afghanistan , has more valuable bargaining chips. // In fact , the US has taken Iran ' s historic anti-Soviet attitudes for granted , thus enabling Washington to embark on a dangerous gamble . Yet under US military pressure , Iran would have no choice but to play its Soviet card more effectively. // Moreover , a massive strike against Iran would have negative implications for US interests throughout the Muslim world . Regardless of what the West thinks of Iran and despite its many flaws , Islamic Iran is a significant symbol for many Muslims . The US would pay a price in its relations with the Muslim world just as the Soviets did when they invaded Afghanistan . Ironically , a US strike against Iran could , in the long term , exacerbate the Gulf Arabs ' internal problems and undermine their image in the Arab world by stressing their dependence on the US , the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the Persian Gulf is fraught with serious dangers . To defend freedom of shipping and try ending the Gulf war are worthy goals . But they should be achieved by means other than by succumbing to the manipulation of local powers and rushing warships to the Persian Gulf . Shireen T.
