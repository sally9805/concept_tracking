GERTRUDE STEIN A story . by Tova Reich OME YEARS AGO in Washington , D.C. , Gertrude Stein , who preferred to be known as Trudy , attended a reception at the embassy of a now defunct black African country . The invitation seemed to drop from nowhere and landed with a thin slap on her gray metal desk in the outer chambers of the Office of Education . With not the slightest riff in the stream of her typing , her eyes glided from the memo at her left elbow to the black hand that was now receding into its dazzling scarlet winged sleeve . " Come , " said a deep voice above her hair . " Come , come , " the chant went on , as , typing steadily , she watched him pass down the aisles between the rows of identical desks , distributing his largesse to one and to all . As it happened , her father , the old general practitioner , Louis Stein , was out of town that night at a toymakers ' convention , so it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . In fact , this was a service he had never requested of her , but it was one that she accepted as her burden soon after her mother died , when she was eleven , and in time her father came to expect it , too . Dr. Tova Reich is the author of Mara , a novel ( Farrar , Straus and Giroux ) . Stein 's office was in the basement of their modest home in Silver Spring . It had grown shabby over the years , as his ambition and his clientele had waned , but a core of faithful old women who believed in his diagnostic powers still made their sighing way down the broken steps for his touch . He had a tender way of comforting them in their ailments , knowing there was no cure . He did not cultivate the aura of those smug young specialists , who pranced about as if they alone would be spared the common and mortal afflictions . To fill the gaps that lengthened between patients , Dr. Stein busied himself inventing elaborate games for children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the worn green leather sofa , the ladies still enjoyed a good gossip about Louis Stein 's wife . " A difficult woman , " they all agreed . " He was mad about her . " But for Gertrude , the memory of her mother was through smoke . There was that sepia photograph on her father 's bedside table of a sleek , fading stranger , wan and romantic . As a child Gertrude had been admonished to tread lightly outside her mother 's door until noon . As long as the sun shone her mother lay stretched out in discontent on the living room couch . When Louis Stein trudged up the stairs in the evening , she would turn her negligeed back to him . He would pour some cold cereal into a bowl and this would be his meal . Sometimes her mother would seize her in such a woeful embrace that Gertrude experienced it more as invasion and doom than love . Her mother suffered from a heart damaged by rheumatic fever in childhood . It was well known that her very life dangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gertrude . The baby was plucked out unnaturally , like a weed , in a Caesarian section . Gertrude 's mother spent the next eleven years recuperating . In general , Gertrude preferred not to associate with the other secretaries at work . The reason for this was simple . She had nothing in common with them . They were a dull , minimally schooled group , G.S . threes and fours in the civil service , clerk-typists , actually , whereas she was a five , having completed her education at American University , with a major in early childhood . Their presence in front of a typewriter represented a move upward from households where the men labored with callused hands and sweated in their armpits . They were not even blue collar ; they were shirtless . The women went down on their knees to scrub the tiles on other people 's bathroom floors . For Gertrude , on the other hand , this position was clearly a descent , but she chose it because it left her soul intact . " It 's just a job to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only woman in the office with whom she had become close . " It 's pin money . It does n't play havoc with my spirit . My spirit is free . " Bunny understood . She had had some college and read Irish fairy tales with swimming eyes . Bunny was already married and , although she did not yet know it , in the first hours of her first pregnancy . Her husband was a cartographer who had just been dispatched to Saigon . In 1963 , within a year after this incident , Bunny was gone , having settled with her daughter , Deirdre , in a plain bungalow in Miami 's Coconut Grove . Gertrude and Bunny spent their lunch hours together , at a sandwich counter or shopping the sales at Garfinckel 's and Woodies . They shared a few good laughs over tuna on whole wheat . " The language , God ! " Bunny would explode , sending a rosette of soggy crumbs over the Formica table . " Were you there the other day ? " she cried . " Sandy ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberta is cascading . ' " " Oh , no ! " Gertrude gasped . Then , suddenly sober , she added , " Well , Roberta is pretty far gone . She wo n't be able to hide it much longer . " Bunny shrugged . " Poor Roberta , " Gertrude said . " She sits there listening to the Dictaphone , typing away , struggling , struggling . Every time Dr. Pollack says ' milieu ' she types ' mill you . ' Rhymes with kill you . Unfortunately for Roberta , milieu is a very hot word in the education business . " In short , the two women kept themselves apart . They would not even apply makeup in the same mirror as the others . They allowed the impression that they were above the common vanities . In the bathroom one day Gertrude rubbed a smudge of green eyeshadow into her lids . She sucked in her cheeks and arched her eyebrows , composing herself in the mirror in that special private look she considered her most beguiling . It was already too late when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , splitting sunflower shells with bladelike teeth . She had been caught in the act . Roberta opened her mouth and laughed , spraying Gertrude with wet seeds . T WAS a humid Thursday in late August when the invitations fell their way . The air had to be parted in order to pass through , the dark clouds were teasing . Nevertheless , during their lunch hour , Gertrude and Bunny set out on a long walk up Connecticut Avenue , propelled by the hunting noontime masses , and found themselves at an African boutique , with nothing particular in mind . Phlegmatically , they pushed the garments along the racks . Gertrude pulled out a kaftan in shades of brown and gold . " This would be a great thing to wear to the party tonight , " she remarked . " Do n't tell me you 're going ! " said Bunny . " No , of course not . " Still , Gertrude carried the robe into the dressing room and slipped it on over her clothing . The only stranger she had ever undressed before was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping forays , Bunny seldom caught even a glimpse of Gertrude 's bra strap . " It 's nice , " Bunny said , " very ethnic , like a costume . " " Hmm , " said Gertrude , smoothing the cloth along her flanks , " I suppose it would be all right to go if one thought of it as a masquerade . " " I 'm not so sure , " Bunny said . Gertrude stared at herself , as at a rival . Bunny straddled a wicker stool . " Before he left , Perry told me to go out once in a while . ' Do n't sit at home every night moping and missing me , ' he said . ' I do n't want to come back to a depressed wife . ' " " Do you think he was kidding ? " Gertrude wondered . Bunny sighed . " Well , he 's probably relieving himself of his loneliness over there , one way or another , " she said . " Oh , what the hell ! " said Gertrude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the shop , as Gertrude was completing the transaction , Bunny fingered a strand of wooden beads . " How much ? " she asked . The clerk examined the tag . " I do n't know , it 's hard to read . Forty dollars , I think . " ' Forty dollars ! " Bunny exclaimed . " That 's ridiculous . " " Well , you certainly have expensive tastes , " said Gertrude . " Maybe it 's from a bewitched tree . " " Wait a minute , " the salesgirl said . She looked at it again . " I 'm sorry , forty cents . " Bunny bought the 48 necklace . The two women agreed to meet in front of the embassy at seven . " We 'll just drop in , see what it 's like , " said Bunny . " It 's insignificant , " Gertrude said . She felt secure in the knowledge that she had washed her hair the night before . A forked vein of lightning flashed in the sky , a reminder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to come down hard . Gertrude and Bunny set their pocketbooks on top of their heads and ran inside . The embassy was in a townhouse on a side street off Massachusetts Avenue . In later years Gertrude passed by it many times without recognizing it . She also preserved a very faint recollection of what its interior was like . There was a rush of crimson and gold , and a memory of large murals of black men with formidable biceps and raised fists . As soon as they entered they were handed paper cups filled with a pink liquid . Gertrude tipped hers back recklessly , emptying it without once releasing its brim from her lips . She had been fasting from the moment she had made the decision to attend this reception , for she valued the gaunt look as her most striking . The drink was cold and sweet . The alcohol rose to the roots of her hair and spread to the tips of her fingers . By the time she finished her second cup , two black men in dashikis had claimed them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weightlessness , of emigration , and then the fall . " Passed out , " said a person in the distance , perhaps Bunny . The two men , with Bunny 's collapsing assistance , dragged Gertrude into the front ball . " I will take her home , " said one of them . His voice had a lilt to it , a tune that kept Gertrude locked in her trance . " Where is her car , please ? " He began rummaging through Gertrude 's purse for the keys . " I do n't know if we should be doing this , " Bunny protested , but she could n't stop giggling . She slumped against the one who had now become officially designated as hers . That one laid an arm across her shoulder . " Relax , honey , everything will be beautiful , " he said . " He is my friend . I am ready at this time to vouch for him . He is a model husband and father . He is a top executive . He signs all his letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so sure it 's all right , " Bunny said . " Just be a nice girl , see , and give my friend here directions , " said her man . Bunny was refusing , shaking her head from side to side , but then she became so enchanted by the pattern of her movement that she began to use her head to draw greater and greater circles in the soupy air . Soon her entire self danced away into the storm . " Never mind , I have her number , " said Gertrude 's man . He was waving what appeared to be a credit card or a driver 's license . " Now take it slow , " he said to Gertrude 's sodden body . " Just hold on tight to Daddy . That 's my good girl . " And he carried her over the threshold . HE NEXT MORNING Gertrude awoke in her own bed with a disastrous headache and the taste of death in her mouth . Her shoes and panties were on the floor . Her new kaftan was bunched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although her breasts had been pushed out from under the cloth . There was a whitish paste on her thighs and blood on her sheet . When she finally got up to smile at herself in the mirror , the white paste cracked over her lips . Gertrude looked at the clock . " Oh , my God , after nine ! " She smacked her forehead with the heel of her palm , Then she sat down to call the office . She wanted to speak to Bunny . Bunny had not yet arrived , she was told . She asked for Roberta . " Hi , baby , " Roberta answered cheerily . " I 've been held up , " Gertrude said with clenched formality . " I 'll be a bit late . Could you sign in for me ? " " Sho ' thin ' , baby . Mornin ' sickness , you fancy ? " She laughed again . Gertrude hung up . She stepped into the shower and expunged it all , down the drains , into the sewers , into the seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before , stuffed them in the washing machine , and set the dial . When she finished dressing , she began to search for her pocketbook . Maybe I left it in the car , she thought . She went out into the driveway . Blank space had replaced her car . She walked across the lawn toward the little post with the sign LOUIS STEIN , M.D. Even as a small girl , after an invigorating feud with the kids on her block , she and those on her side had always regrouped around that pole . It was home base , it recharged her . But it , too , was gone . Gertrude returned to the office the following Monday and sat down briskly at her desk without greeting anyone . She avoided Bunny purposefully , and she continued working even when the rumble of the coffee wagon could be heard in the corridor , announcing a minor social event and evoking that pleasantly unsettling feeling of something that needed to be done to get the day moving . Dr. Pollack strode in wearing a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women appraised this outfit coldly . Dr. Pollack sat down on a chair beside Gertrude 's desk and crossed her legs . There was the embarrassingly unprofessional hiss of nylon-encased thighs sliding against each other and sealing . She was holding a grade school textbook . " We missed you on Friday , " she said to Gertrude . " Were you sick ? " Gertrude shook her head , " Is everything all right ? " Dr. Pollack inquired . " I was robbed , " said Gertrude . " They took everything . " Helen Pollack shook her head . Briefly , she described the burglary some months back of her own home in Northwest . " I felt violated , " she said . " It took quite a while before I could once again feel that what I had was really mine . " Gertrude nodded . Dr. Pollack asked Gertrude to reserve a seat for her on a flight to Georgia . " I 've got to jump down there immediately to wake those old boys up , " she explained . " Civil rights is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the birds and the bees . If they want the dole , they 'd better hop to it . " She opened the book on her lap . " Just look at this ! " she declared , tapping a picture of a group of children at play . There were S three whites in the illustration and one black , but the black child had pink arms . " Very cynical stuff , would n't you say ? They can do better than that , those lousy publishers . It 's a disgrace . " She waited , testing Gertrude 's reaction . " I have a special job for you , " she told Gertrude , " It 's obvious that you 're a cut above the other girls in this office . With time and effort , and , of course , with my support and encouragement , you can even be fitted into the slot of administrative assistant , a seven or maybe even a nine . I have no doubt . Trudy , did you notice that huge pile of textbooks in my office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Check each and every illustration . The rule is , every picture showing a bunch of children must contain one black face , and not only the face . A black in every family , that 's our motto . " Helen Pollack grinned . She rose efficiently . She had the look of a busy person who was taking time out to perform an amenity . Gertrude could only be grateful . " You know , Trudy , " she said , " I 'm really sorry about what happened to you . But there 's nothing like plunging yourself into work to get your mind off your troubles . It 's the best therapy , believe me , especially if the work is for a noble cause . " Bunny took to leaving cute little notes on Gertrude 's desk . " Hi there . Remember me ? " ; " Let 's be friends . Okay ? " ; " I 'm lonely . Wish you were here . " ; " Do n't be cruel to a heart that 's true . " The last was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with flowers and smiling faces . Gertrude crumpled them up audibly and tossed them into the wastebasket , where they unfolded slightly , as if they were alive . Then one day Bunny stepped into the toilet cubicle alongside the one in which Gertrude was sitting . " I know you 're in there , Trudy , " she said . " I recognize your shoes . We bought them together at Hahn 's . " Gertrude tried to halt the flow of her stream . " This is it , Trudy , " said Bunny . " You 'd better talk to me or I 'm going to crawl under and look at you . " " Just leave me alone , " said Gertrude . " I do n't want to have anything more to do with you . " " Why ? What did I do ? Tell me what I did and I 'll never bother you again . " Gertrude was in the midst of an episode that was , " she said . Bunny said , " Sure I know . You 're in tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix with us inferiors , right ? " " You 're out of your mind , Bunny . " " I 'm warning you , " said Bunny , " I 'm going to climb up on this toilet seat right now and peek . " " We ca n't talk about it here , " Gertrude said . " Somebody might be listening . " " I do n't give a damn , " Bunny cried . She ran out of her booth and set her body against Gertrude 's door . " Talk fast or you 're stuck in there for life . " Gertrude tried to squeeze under the partition , but there were puddles on both sides . She soon gave up . She noticed a pair of swollen black ankles at the far end of the row . " Okay , okay , " said Gertrude in a grief-stricken whisper . " It 's just that I ca n't believe a true friend would ever have thrown me to the dogs the way you did . " " What are you talking about ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You allowed that Negro from the embassy to take me home when I was helpless , knocked out cold . He stole my car , he stole my purse , he stole my father 's signpost . And I 'll tell you something else , he raped me as part of the package . " " How do you know ? " " Look , Bunny , " and here Gertrude laughed bitterly , " a rape is a rape is a rape . There were certain unmistakable signs . I do n't want to go into it . " And for your information , " Gertrude went on , her voice rising jaggedly , " I was in my fertile period . I took my temperature that morning and it was elevated . If I get pregnant , whom will I have to blame ? I 'm already three weeks late , and it 's your fault , Bunny , your fault ! have to commit suicide , or maybe , if I 'm lucky , my father will find out and he 'll do me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessly , flushing the toilet again and again to drown her wails . N THE WAY back from the toy-makers ' convention , Louis Stein passed right by his own home . His natural absentmindedness had run rampant over the years , and without the signpost , upon which he had always relied , he failed to recognize the house . He scratched his head and instructed the taxi driver to go on . " I do n't know , " he said self-mockingly , " it used to be here somewhere . It 's funny , but I think I 'm lost . " They circled the area for a while until finally he gave up and requested to be dropped off at an unfamiliar corner . He opened his wallet and checked his ad-dress on his identification card . In one hand he was carrying his old plaid canvas satchel and in the oth-er a pink plastic attache case with the words " Barbie Is Off on a Career . " It was a promotional item dis-tributed by Mattel , and it was filled with giveaways and samples that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniature mental ward devised by a company that had made its fortune in doctor sets . He was so engrossed in displaying the loot to his daughter that he scarcely paid attention when Gertrude reported the robbery . " My car , my bag , your signpost , everything , " she said softly . What he felt was a dim sadness that Gertrude was not sharing his enthusiasm over the treasures . But when he finished he looked at her face for the first time and noticed the two long strands of tears . " What happened , Gertie ? Tell me , " he cried , utterly alarmed . She repeated her tale . " It 's nothing , nothing , " he said consolingly , restraining himself from embracing her , for , after all , she was already a mature woman . " They 're just things . What do things matter anyway ? Things can be replaced . We might even be insured . I 'll have to check . The main point is you were n't hurt . Now smile for me , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Dr. Stein zipped open his suitcase . " Look what I have ! " he said . He was holding up a large shingle , stained in wood tones and painted with garlands of brightly colored flowers . " See what it says , " Dr. Stein exclaimed . Gertrude saw : " Papa Louie Stein , Toy-maker . " She smiled . " That 's better , " her father said . " I never cared for that pompous old signpost anyhow ! " Last of all he pulled out a red stocking cap with a fluffy white porn-pom at the tail and drew it down low over his brow . " Makes me look like Santa Claus , right ? " Gertrude laughed out loud . But as the days passed it was clear to Louis Stein that his daughter was not happy . She slept too much and ate too little . Classical symptoms , Dr. Stein concluded . Well , who is happy on this planet ? But for his own child he had hoped for better . Her unhappiness was a calamity , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years , but it had not been easy with no woman in the house . He was an innately diffident man , and even after a lifetime of medical practice , and after years of being entrusted with the most shameful secrets , the color still rose to his cheeks when it became necessary , in the course of taking a history , to ask the most intimate of questions . So around the time that he figured his daughter should begin menstruating , he would discreetly leave little pamphlets on her dresser , which had been sent to him by the drug companies specializing in painkillers . Let the professionals explain it to her , he reflected with relief . " Very Personally Yours , " they were called , or " Now You Are a Woman , " and their covers were illustrated with a single long-stemmed red rose . Very feminine , Dr. Stein assumed . He was never sure Gertrude was wearing the right sort of underwear . Who was there to guide her ? She had been wretched and overweight as a teenager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice her walking down the street , slowly , aimlessly , joylessly gobbling down one chocolate bar after another . He hid in a doorway . His heart was broken . On the rare occasions that she would confide in him he tried earnestly to help her . Once she had told him that Molly , a school pal , was tormenting her with stories of a mad telephone caller who would declare in a frightening accent , " Inform your friend Gertrude Stein that she has a preposterous name and that I am going to kill her immediately if not sooner . " Then there would be a click and morbid stillness . Dr. Stein had said , " Just tell Molly to ask this idiot to call you directly so you can discuss what he has against you . Then , while you 're keeping him busy on the phone , I 'll run to the corner , get hold of the police , and have them trace the call . " This miserable drama dragged on for weeks . " Molly said the man agreed to call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stein house never came , and Molly continued with her grim account of these nightly threats . " Tell Molly that he phoned you , " Dr. Stein had finally advised . A week later Gertrude glumly announced that , according to Molly , the calls had ceased . Father and daughter concluded that the entire affair had been brewed in Molly 's vengeful imagination . But secretly Louis Stein wondered if it had not all been the pathetic fiction of his own child , her perverse gift to him to pacify his entreaty that she share her problems with him . Or perhaps she was punishing him for calling her Gertrude , after his mother . It was such an unfashionable name , and , coupled with Stein , it was nothing less than a joke . " Do n't worry , " he used to reassure her , " you 'll get married someday and your last name will be changed . " Now , after the robbery , she was sadder and more reclusive than ever . There were mornings when he could hear her in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running water . " What 's wrong , Gertie ? " he would plead from behind the door . " I want to help you . " " I 'm all right , " she would reply . " Just go away . " HERE WAS no one for Gertrude to turn to in her plight but Bunny . The friendship was patched up with troubled threads . Their lunch hours were spent together on the cooling autumnal grass of Lafay-ette Park , chewing and rechew-ing the catastrophe . " The main thing is to find out for sure , " Bunny kept saying . But Gertrude just shook her head . " I 'm not married . It would be too humiliating , " she said . " You could use a pseudonym . " " Like Gertrude Stein , for instance ? " " Look , Trudy , this mess is partly my fault , " said Bunny . " I was soused , true , but I still feel guilty , " She offered to deliver a bottle of Gertrude 's urine to be tested at a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own name , " said Bunny . " I 'm married , after all . I 'm legit . " Gertrude reluctantly agreed . The next day she handed Bunny a brown paper bag containing a jar wrapped up in nearly half a roll of toilet paper , filled with her first voiding of the morning . Bunny , who was also experiencing certain symptoms , opened the bag with her nose averted and placed a bottle of her own alongside her friend 's . Sentence was passed a few days later : positive . Their lunchtime meetings became more and more frantic and desperate . What was there to be done ? She could mysteriously disappear for the duration of her pregnancy , have the baby , and then surrender it for adoption , or dump it in a trash can , or abandon it as a foundling on a prosperous doorstep . But who would cherish such a black bundle ? Or she could confine herself to her home until her hour drew near and postpone for the meanwhile the decision of how to dispose of the suffering protoplasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H.E.W. , embarrassing her superiors and littering the sidewalk . Each of these options was rejected . Each would drive a spike through her father 's heart . The Iast resort was to seek out an abortionist in the dismal alleys of the city . This was both terrifying and criminal , but it was the only course available to them . That afternoon the two women followed Roberta 's waddle to the ladies ' room . " Roberta ! " Bunny called out in a strained voice . Startled , the black woman swiveled around , clutching her swelling belly . " Don ' evah do dat agin ' , you heah ? " Roberta cried . " You scare da shit outta me . My kid gon na come out wid a big ugly white spot on his ass , shape of a spider . " " We 're sorry , " said Gertrude , " but we need to talk to you . " " Well , you just gon na haveta wait . Junior here is campin ' on my pee sack . I got ta go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time Gertrude and Bunny stood like petitioners outside her door , enduring her groans as part of the fee . " That sho ' was a good one , " Roberta sighed when she finally reappeared . Gertrude hung back while Bunny briefly sketched the outline of the case . Roberta 's laughter rebounded off the tiles . " Oh , my Lord , you sho ' got knock up but good . Who da lucky guy ? " But Gertrude merely shook her head . Roberta said , yes , she was acquainted with an abortion lady , her own aunt , as a matter of fact , name of Virtue . " That ain ' her real name , course . " " Why do n't you use her ? " Bunny dared to ask . Roberta seemed shocked . " Oh , Virtue , she high class . She don ' do it for us colored folk , " said Roberta . A baby-blue Cadillac picked Gertrude up at the designated street corner somewhere near St. Elizabeths Hospital . She was sped blindfolded along a curved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other through what she surmised was the southeast section of the city . The car stopped and she was shoved out violently and steered up several flights of creaking stairs by what felt like a man 's large hand propping up her rump . She heard a door slam behind her . The cloth was removed from her eyes . Before her sat a blurry , massive woman with only a few coils of hair on her head and two or three yellow teeth in her mouth . This was Virtue . Her bloated feet were resting on the lap of a man with a stocking drawn grotesquely over his face . Black or white , Gertrude could not distinguish . " Footstool , " Virtue called him . His was the role of go-between . All communication had to be filtered through him . His voice was muffled and there was a wet stain on the nylon where his mouth must have been . The room contained a long , low table scarred with knife cuts and carved with hearts and initials . Along the peeling walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathtub , " to drown the little ' F , ' " the man said , " in case he comes out kicking . ' F ' stands for fetus . You 're here to murder , " he said , " and do n't you forget it ! " She was ordered to hand over her purse . It was turned upside down and all its contents dumped and displayed on the floor . Footstool kicked aside her personal effects , found the five hundred dollars agreed upon in advance , and passed them to Virtue , who lifted one haunch slightly , expelled some gas , slipped the bills underneath , and resettled herself on top of them . Gertrude was told to strip and lie down on the table with her butt at the edge . Footstool lowered Virtue 's legs and pushed the table up to the old woman . He set a chair on either side of Virtue and placed one of Gertrude 's legs on each , with the knee bent . " You just get used to that position , " Footstool said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sustenance . " He brought over a bowl of gruel . Virtue lowered her head and mumbled what must have been grace , or perhaps it was a prayer for guidance and forgiveness . Footstool began to feed the woman , one patient spoonful after another . When Virtue was finished eating , Footstool squatted down alongside Gertrude . " Pick your poison , " he said . He showed her what seemed to have once been a coathanger , another object that resembled a poker , and a plastic bag filled with a liquid that looked , to Gertrude 's dazed eyes , as if it had guppies swimming inside . " Saline solution , " Footstool explained . " Our deluxe model . Smokes the little critter out in no time . Suffocates ? hirn , whammo ! Cuts off his lifeline  --  very elegant-like . " There was nothing for Gertrude to say . " Okay , " said Footstool , " we 'll let the experts decide . Now slide down the table and keep those legs apart . " Gertrude could feel Virtue 's husky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the old woman 's wheezing stopped . Could she have dropped dead at such a time ? Gertrude wondered . There was a knock at the door . Gertrude made out the heavy tread of several men . Three or four , maybe . Footstool rose and offered them some beer . They stood around behind her head , drinking , joking , belching , conversing in deep tones . She could not make out what they were saying . Every once in a while , Footstool would turn to Gertrude 's zone and admonish her , " Now do n't start letting those legs swing together . " One of the men suggested a quick game of poker . Gertrude could hear the slapping of cards and the jingling of coins . When they were gone Footstool turned his attention HARPERVAUGUST 1982 back to Gertrude . He said , " Before she begins the dirty work , Miss Virtue wants to know how it happened . " Gertrude whispered the information in a single word . " Rape , " Footstool shouted in Virtue 's ear . Just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , well , well , how 've you been ? . It 's been a long time for sure ... How 's Thelma doing ? How 're the little ones ? ... Good , good ?

Did I get them all right ? And how 's Coco ? . . . And Shorty ? ... And Wilbur ? ... Edgar ? Calvin ? . ? . Arthur ? Obie and Desdemona ? Still together ? ... Milly ? .. . Yvette ? ... " When he hung up at last Footstool said to Gertrude , " Miss Virtue wants all the disgusting details . " So Gertrude summarized her story . " Embassy party , dead drunk , " he relayed in a scream . Footstool said , " Miss Virtue wants to know which embassy . " Gertrude mumbled some words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Developing country . " Footstool said , " Miss Virtue wants to know if the perpetrator was of the Negro persuasion . " Gertrude nodded her head . " One of ours , " he yelled in the old woman 's deaf ears . Footstool said , " Miss Virtue says to grab your clothes and get the hell out of here . She do n't kill black babies . Only whites . " ERTRUDE fled , holding her despised rags over her nakedness . She dressed in panic in the stairwell . Outside , in the dangerous streets , she waited a long while before a passing cab would stop for her . When it reached her home she ran inside and brought out the money to pay the fare . She went to the medicine cabinet and took out a bottle of Darvon . She counted out thirty pills and lined them up in a straight row on her bed . Then she fell asleep beside them , fully clothed . Her father entered her room and removed her shoes . He collected the tablets and then proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ropes , and every possible instrument of annihilation . He sat down at her schoolgirl 's desk . " My poor child , what can I do for you ? " he wrote . " Anything , anything at all . Just tell me and I will do it . This is the reason : I love you . " He left the note on her pillow , and beside it a small toy , a glass globe with a frozen skater inside . When you shook it the spell broke . The snowflakes tumbled , the bells tinkled , and the girl danced in bliss . Gertrude 's sleep was raucous with dreams . She was standing on top of a hill , holding the hand of a small girl . Was it on the Mall ? But she could not remember ever having seen a hill there . Still , something resembling the Washington Monument shot up in the distance . The little girl called it the big pencil . Who was this girl ? Herself , the child ? All around them men and women were flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the shape of a bat . The child mounted it . Gertrude began to run , unraveling the string . The kite soared higher and higher , over the treetops , into the clouds . " Let her go , " the child sang . The kite vanished into the pale shadow of the moon . She woke up , moaning and bereft . Sleep devoured her again . Her father was in a playground . It looked like Candy Cane City , but not exactly . He was swinging on a swing . She was pushing him , or perhaps it was not she , perhaps it was Bunny Newman . " Pump ! Pump ! " she shouted at him . The chains of the swing began to wind around the horizontal peppermint-stick bar , until her father was perched gleefully on top . " Come on up , " he called to her . " The air is breezy with the flapping of moth wings . " " No , no , " she cried out loud , casting herself into wakefulness . Again she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her job was to examine every volume . She could hear Dr. Pollack 's clipped voice : " Do n't miss a single one . Equal time , fair play , balance , balance . " Whenever Darwin 's theory of evolution was expounded in a textbook and there was an accompanying picture of an ape , her task was to check and make sure that the facing page showed a scene from the six days of creation . Aha ! Here was an offender  --  a solitary simian . She stared at it a long time . Its top lip lifted , baring the gum , displaying stained teeth . It looked almost human , grimacing , like Roberta in the glass . Gertrude called in sick the next morning . " You bet yo ' life , " Roberta said . She spent the entire day downstairs in her father 's office , furiously tidying up , scrubbing the walls and floors , lathering the furniture , sweeping the cobwebs off the ceilings , dusting and polishing . It reminded her of a time in her childhood when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's night during the polio plague , before the development of the vaccine . Everywhere children were succumbing . Her own cousin was locked up in an iron lung , dangling between death and a life of paralysis . Gertrude awoke complaining of a stiff neck . Her father hurried to her bedside , and his worry and concern were so palpable that she escalated her cries and embellished her distress . He wrapped her neck in towels soaked in alcohol and wintergreen . He sat beside her , stroking her arm , cooing in her ear . It was such a comfort , the sweet reward of sickness , she could have made a career of it . By dawn , when he was ready to lift her up and carry her like a baby to the hospital , she admitted that the pain had disappeared . The next day , in expiation , she cleaned the entire house from top to bottom . Even fewer patients than usual visited Dr. Stein that day . There was one woman whose eye had erupted with blood as she sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had endured a night of aggravation , and so she came sim-ply to have her blood pressure checked . It was high , and she left elated . And there was a little black boy who had been kicked in the groin by a playmate . His penis was bleeding . Gertrude listened as her father pointed out the danger of infection . " It would be best to circumcise it , " she heard him say . She watched as he performed the surgery and then dressed the wound with what he called a " magical bandage . " It consisted of seven layers . The beginning of a suspenseful story , featuring supernatural creatures , was written and illustrated on the top layer . Dr. Stein instructed the child to remove one layer each day to uncover the next episode . By the seventh day he would learn what happens at the end , " and your yo-yo will be good as new . " After the boy and his mother left , Louis Stein turned to his daughter . " And what can I do for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of demeanors . Gertrude sat down in the patient 's chair . " There 's no cure for me , Dr. Stein , " she said . " Oh , I have a bag full of tricks , Miss Stein , the likes of which you 've never seen . " " No , Dr. Stein , it 's just too awful to talk about . " " Miss Stein , I assure you , whatever is said in this room remains sealed in here forever . You 're protected by the sacred rules of confidentiality that govern the relations between the physician and his patient . " " I just ca n't talk about it , Dr. Stein . It 's too hideous . I 'm too ashamed . You 've never heard a more terrible tale . " " I 've heard plenty in my time , Miss Stein . Why do n't you try me ? " So Gertrude told him the whole story . It had formed a crust over all her words and actions for nearly three months , yet it took less than a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head down on his desk , wept and wept and could not be consoled . Louis Stein raised his hand to pat her hair , but then withdrew it . " Miss Stein , " he said , " pull yourself together . I 'll need a few days to consider the options and to decide upon the best therapeutic course . In the meantime , remain calm and do n't do anything foolish . Come back on this day . " He scribbled a date and time on an appointment card . Then he rose and shook her hand . Gertrude left at once . IIREE DAYS later , promptly at the designated hour , Gertrude re-turned to his office . She was wear-ing her coat and carrying her pocketbook , and she entered from the outside instead of descending the stairs from the kitchen . " Ring bell and walk in , " the little plaque said . She did so , and sat down in the empty waiting room leafing through copies of Redbook magazine , which were more than three years old . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said , 53 and stood aside to allow her to pass before him into the inner chambers . When they were seated across the desk from each other , Louis Stein began . " Miss Stein , I have been in this business a good many years . I have seen people born and I have seen them die . I 've done my best to help them at each end . At least I have tried to do no harm . There were times , and I tell you this in confidence , that I 've done things that were not strictly legal . 1 have pulled plugs and let them go in peace . I have killed monstrous infants . I have performed abortions . . . 1 think this might be such a time . " He paused . " Are you in agreement ? " Gertrude closed her eyes . " Good . " He handed her a folded white bedsheet . " Go into the next room and get undressed . Empty your bladder . Lie down on the table and place your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . be in in a few minutes . " He was wearing a surgical gown , a cap , and a mask when he entered the narrow examining room . He lowered the sheet and exposed the breasts , palpating them while looking away . Slightly swollen , perhaps , but not significantly so . Then he turned his eyes upon them . There was no vascular engorgement , secondary areola , or enlargement of the circumlacteal sebaceous glands worth noting . He drew a rubber glove over his hand and sat down on the stool at the foot of the table . " Please bear with me , miss , " he said . " Do n't let those legs swing together . " He pushed aside the sheet that fell between her legs , like a diaper . He looked at the vagina . There was no cyanosis , but perhaps it was still too early . He inserted a finger into the vaginal canal , flexing the fundus at the same time . There was no real softening of the cervix at the tip or at the uterine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The signs , Ladin 's , Hegar 's , McDonald 's , Von Fernwald 's , were not particularly evident . He took an instrument from his table . " This may hurt a little , " he said . " Please try to cooperate . " He struggled to dilate the cervix to No. 20 Hanks , but it was extremely tight . Gertrude let out a scream . The sweat on Louis Stein 's brow was running into his eyes . He inserted a curette , systematically exploring the entire uterine cavity . There were no irregularities  --  no tumors , septa , scarred regions , or recesses . There were no tissue fragments or blood clots . There were no polyps or myomas . There were no animals , vegetables , or minerals . There was no earth , water , fire , or air . There was no Tom , Dick , or Harry . There was no word , written or spoken . There was no song or laughter . No Jack or Jill . No Baby Blue . " Get it out , get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He inserted an open dry sponge to wipe out the walls of the uterine cavity , twisting it as he removed it . There was nothing there , a barren icescape and forgotten . " Oh , Mama , Mama , " Gertrude cried , " when will it be over ? " " It 's over , poor girl , " said Louis Stein . " You can get up . The baby is out . It 's all over . " ? HARPERS/AUGUST 1962
