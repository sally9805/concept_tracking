His total of 19-under-par 261 for four rounds was the lowest score on the PGA Tour since Johnny Miller shot 260 in the 1975 Phoenix Open . Gilder also broke the Westchester Classic record of 269 , also by Miller , in 1974 when the par was 72. // Toward the end , Gilder said , he was emotionally drained from the excitement of winning and from the double-eagle 2 he had made Saturday , and from a cold he was battling . All he wanted to do , he said , " was to get in without tripping over my own feet. " // " I was pretty high the first 15 holes , feeling pretty strong , " Gilder said of the final round . " But after the 16th my cold started catching up with me , and my body felt drained. " // As a result he ended the tournament on an anticlimactic note , taking a three-putt bogey 6 at the 18th , the same par-5 hole where he had scored 2 on Saturday by holing a 3-wood shot of 251 yards from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win , leading every round , " said Gilder . " I got hot , made a lot of putts and hit the ball as well as I could hit it. " // For the fourth straight day Gilder broke the par of 70 for the Westchester Country Club course , shooting a 69 to follow rounds of 64 , 63 and 65 . He ran off three straight birdies on the seventh , eighth and ninth holes , and for a while it looked as if he was in position to tie or break the tour record for 72 holes , 257 . That was set by Mike Souchak in the 1955 Texas Open on Brackenridge Park , a municipal golf course in San Antonio. // Gilder needed 65 to tie the mark , and he seemed to be on his way after the three consecutive birdies . But when he missed a 4-foot birdie putt at the ninth hole his chances were slim because , over all , the back nine of Westchester does not readily give up birdies . He tapered off with two bogeys on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // While Gilder was strolling away with the victory his two playing partners , Peter Jacobsen and Tom Kite , were competing for second place . Kite birdied the 18th hole to clinch a tie with Jacobsen . Kite and Jacobsen finished at 266 . Jacobsen scored 66 today and Kite 68. // Jacobsen said it was ironic that he had been helped by some tips from Kite . On the practice tee a couple of days ago , Kite made some suggestions that helped Jacobsen groove his swing better. // This was Gilder ' s second victory of the 1982 season , and , for the second time , Gilder ' s wife , Peggy , made a nighttime cross-country flight to see the finale. // On the Saturday night before he won the Byron Nelson Classic in Dallas , Gilder asked his wife if she would like to join him the next day to see him win . She said she would , and she took a late-night flight from Portland , Ore. , to join him. // Saturday night Mrs. Gilder did it again . She took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , arriving at Kennedy International Airport at 3 : 30 A.M. <> <> Gilder Prefers Privacy // Gilder , who is 31 years old and a 1973 graduate of Arizona State , lives in Corvallis , Ore. , and he and his wife have three children. // Gilder has said that he does not want to be a superstar because it would cost him his privacy . His preference is to make a good livelihood on the golf tour and to enjoy as much time as possible with his family. // This afternoon he modified that stance a bit . " I want to be recognized as a great player , " he said , " but they don ' t want to make you a superstar until you win a major tournament . So I am looking forward to the P.G.A. championship in August. " // Today ' s victory was Gilder ' s fourth on the tour , which he joined in the fall of 1975 . His previous victories before this season were the Phoenix Open in 1976 , in his second start as a professional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth multiple winner this season , which qualifies him to play in the World Series of Golf in August . Today ' s purse of $72 , 000 is nearly as much as he won in all of last season , $74 , 756 . It increased his winnings for this season to $196 , 704 . That comes close to the goal Gilder says he had set at the start of this season , $200 , 000. // His career winnings on the PGA Tour now total $769 , 505 . Gilder has made the cut in all 18 of his starts this season . Before the Byron Nelson victory his best placement was fourth in the Tucson Open. <> was not nervous , I felt comfortable , " he said . " At first I was thinking about Souchak ' s record , but the putts were not falling , and you can ' t force it to happen . Toward the end I was thinking , ' How did he do it , anyway ? ' " // When today ' s round started the standing was : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jacobsen , 10 under . Gilder began his birdie string at the par-5 fifth , where he pitched to 5 feet . On the 133-yard sixth he hit a wedge to 10 feet and sank the putt . Then he birdied from 12 feet on the seventh. // The 15th , a par 4 of 470 yards , had not treated Gilder well this week . Today he bogeyed it for the second time after driving into the rough. // When Gilder came to the par-5 18th , where he had shot the double eagle 2 Saturday , he was emotionally tired . His drive was about 25 yards shorter than Saturday ' s . He said there were no " flashbacks " to Saturday ' s second shot . All he wanted to do this time , he said , was to get it near the green with the same 3-wood . But Gilder dropped the shot into a sand trap beside the green . He blasted out poorly , 40 feet from the flagstick , and from there he took three putts for bogey. // Kite played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by playing the nine in two under . There was a two-shot swing as Kite bogeyed the 10th and Jacobsen birdied . Jacobsen reached 14 under with a birdie at the 17th . Kite , 11 under after 13 holes , reached 14 with birdies at 14 , 16 and 18. // " Tom has a pretty big heart , " Jacobsen said of Kite . " He ' s had a bad rap from the media about not winning . But remember when Tom Watson was finishing so often in the top 10 without winning . With a little more seasoning , you ' ll see a string of wins as big as Watson ' s. " //
