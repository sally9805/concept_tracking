In his memoir , For the Record , former White House Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan wastes no time before dropping his biggest bombshell . " Because actions that would otherwise bewilder the reader can not be understood in its absence , " writes Regan in a foreword , " I have revealed in this book what was probably the most closely guarded domestic secret of the Reagan White House . " <P> The secret : First Lady Nancy Reagan 's reliance on a San Francisco astrologer to determine the timing of the President 's every public move . This was more than a charming eccentricity shared with the 50 million or so other Americans who , casually or in dead earnest , look to the alignment of the stars for guidance . As White House chief of staff for two years , before he was forced to resign in February 1987 , Regan was in a position to see how the First Lady 's faith in the astrologer 's pronouncements wreaked havoc with her husband 's schedule . At times , he writes , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House . <P> Donald Regan never knew the name of the " Friend , " as Nancy Reagan referred to her astrologer . But TIME learned last week that she is Nob Hill Socialite Joan Quigley , sixtyish , a Vassar graduate who has written three books on astrology ( see story on page 41 ) . <P> As the sensational tip of Regan 's revelatory iceberg broke into the headlines last week , it evoked titillation among Washington insiders and an angry response from Ronald Reagan . " I would have preferred it if he decided to attack me , " he said on Friday . " From what I hear , he 's chosen to attack my wife , and I do n't look kindly on that at all . " <P> Nor is he likely to look kindly on his former aide 's portrayal of the Reagan White House . Regan shows the President as immensely likable but disturbingly passive and vulnerable to manipulation . And he paints a surprisingly dark , meanspirited First Lady , whose meddling became the " random factor in the Reagan presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the first four as Secretary of the Treasury , details how Nancy , and not her husband , stage-managed his ouster . His profile of her in For the Record , which Harcourt Brace Jovanovich is publishing this month and TIME is excerpting in the following pages , constitutes Exhibit 1 in the defense of Donald T. Regan . <P> Nancy Reagan has long been known for her shrewdness and her readiness to step in when she believes others are " taking advantage of Ronnie . " For the most part , she has used humor and self-deprecation to parry charges that she was interfering unduly in affairs of state . " This morning I had planned to clear up U.S.-Soviet differences on intermediate-range nuclear missiles , " she told a publishers ' luncheon in New York City last year . " But I decided to clean out Ronnie 's sock drawer instead . " <P> The First Lady dabbled in astrology as far back as 1967 . In 1981 Quigley made Nancy a believer by showing how the astrologer 's charts could have foretold that the period on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous for the President . On that day a bullet from John Hinckley Jr . ' s handgun gravely wounded the President . From then on , Nancy , obsessed with her husband 's safety , was convinced of her Friend 's power to protect him . And from then on , no presidential public appearance was slated without the Friend 's say-so .
