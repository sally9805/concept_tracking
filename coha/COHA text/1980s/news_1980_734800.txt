txt Allegheny Ludlum Industries Inc. plans to sell its basic specialty steel unit to a group led by Dallas financier Clint W. Murchison Jr . The company , which has been moving to cut its dependence on the cyclical specialty steel business , said the Texas group is offering about $195 million in cash , preferred stock and a note for the unit , Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp . The specific amounts were n't disclosed . That sum is about $20 million below the steel unit 's book value and as a result , Allegheny Ludlum Industries said the sale would be reflected on its company-wide income statement as a net loss from discontinued operations of about $24 million . Sale of the unit has been rumored for some time . Last February , Allegheny Lud- ? him Industries Chairman Robert Buckley ' ' said in a statement that potential buyers had approached the parent company but did n't get far , " largely because the parties showing interest ( did n't ) have the means to justify a discussion . " That apparently is n't the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties and the Dallas Cowboys football team . Mr. Murchison could n't be reached for comment and one of his executives declined to explain the financier 's interest in the specialty steel company . But a business associate , expressing surprise at Mr. Murchison 's offer , asked , " Are you sure he bought a steel company or was it the ( Pittsburgh ) Steelers ? " But if Mr. Murchison 's interest in the company came as something of a surprise , Allegheny Ludlum 's interest in getting out of the specialty steel business was expected , industry sources agreed . While specialty steel once constituted the core of Allegheny Ludlum , analysts estimate that in 1979 it represented only about 30% of the company 's total operating profit . In 1979 , Allegheny Ludlum had net income of $71.5 million , or $7.30 a share , on sales of $1.55 billion . The company noted that it is n't getting out of the steel business entirely . Excluded from the proposed sale , it stressed , are other portions of its metals group , including alloy rods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cyclical as the stainlesssteel business we 're getting out of and they 've been the most profitable parts of our metals business , " a spokesman said . Analysts agreed that Allegheny Ludlum 's decision to dump its specialty steel business may be a wise one . " With the recession it has been a very bad business to be in and it certainly has n't been a great part of Allegheny Ludlum , " said one analyst . Another company follower noted that the proposed sale " fits in with the changes Allegheny Ludlum has been going through . They 're trying to diversify and eliminate cyclical businesses , " he said . Indeed , in recent years , Allegheny Ludlum has acquired such companies as Cheme ? tron Corp . and this year it acquired Wilkinson Match Ltd. of London . Allegheny Ludlum said its plan to sell the steel unit will be submitted to holders for approval at a special meeting Dec. 23 . Closing of the purchase agreement with Mr. Murchison is expected on or before Dec. 28 , with a cash payment to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or delivered , in January 1981 , the company added .
