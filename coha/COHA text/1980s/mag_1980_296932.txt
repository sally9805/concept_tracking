This was no ordinary bus . Anybody could tell as much from the fact that folks are being welcomed aboard by a human-sized cat of polka-dotted green . The mimic cat , it turns out , is named Readmore . And he-or she , or it-is part of the crew of this onetime school bus that the Indiana department of public instruction has dressed up as a roving Read-A-Rama , or bookmobile . The rig has rolled into leafy Claypool ( pop . 464 ) , the smallest of 102 cities and towns on its route , to stir up interest in reading by giving some books away . <P> Claypoolers straggle through the 40-ft. bookmobile for 2 hours-young and middle-aged adults , children with and without parents , and a good many grandparents .

The townspeople jostle amidst the shelves , teasing and badgering one another to decisions . <P> The first aboard , Gladys Yarian , assistant cashier at the Claypool branch of the First National Bank of nearby Warsaw , Ind. , ambles back to her job across Main Street clutching The Call of the Wild . In her wake , Bank Teller Cindy Leslie carries off Little Women . The Rev. Steve Cain , 30 , a Van Gogh beard and casual garb offering no hint that he is pastor of Claypool 's United Methodist Church , chooses Marathon Man on the assumption , he says , that this nasty little spy thriller is about running .

Year before last , as part of a book-reading contest in the first grade , she was able to dash through 150 volumes , including Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's These Happy Golden Years . <P> Outside in the harsh sunshine , bookmobile workers ply everybody with posters and pins promoting-what else ? - reading . Postal Carrier Wendell Brown emerges blinking at the cover of Louis L'Amour 's The Burning Hills and waits for his wife Pat , who steps out bearing another L'Amour , The Lonely Men . Says Pat : " I got it for him . " A well-fed matron waddles off with the Joy of Cooking .
