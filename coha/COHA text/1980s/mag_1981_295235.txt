The remarks that forced Office of Management and Budget Director David Stockman to offer his resignation to President Reagan appeared in a 24-page article in the December issue of the Atlantic Monthly . Among Stockman ' s striking comments : <P> On Reaganomics : " The reason we did it wrong-not wrong , but less than the optimum-was that we said , Hey , we have to get a program out fast . .. We were working in a 20-or 25-day time frame , and we did n't think it all the way through . We did n't add up all the numbers . " In another part of the article : " The pieces were moving on independent tracks-the tax program , where we were going on spending , and the defense program , which was just a bunch of numbers written on a piece of paper .. . But , you see , for about a month and a half we got away with that because of the novelty of all these budget reductions . " <P> On tax cuts : " The hard part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 to 50%-the rest of it is a secondary matter . The original argument was that the top bracket was too high , and that 's having the most devastating effect on the economy . However to make this palatable as a political matter , you had to bring down all the brackets . But , I mean , Kemp-Roth was always a Trojan horse to bring down the top rate . .. It 's kind of hard to sell ' trickle-down , ' so the supply-side formula was the only way to get a tax policy that was really ' trickle-down . ' Supply-side is ' trickle-down ' theory . " <P> On the Administration 's budget estimates and economic forecasts : " None of us really understands what 's going on with all these numbers . You 've got so many different budgets out and so many different baselines and such complexity . .. people are getting from A to B and it 's not clear how they 're getting there . It 's not clear how we got there . One deficit estimate was reached " by hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On defense spending : " The whole question is blatant inefficiency , poor deployment of manpower , contracting idiocy .. . Hell , I think there 's a kind of swamp of $10 to $20 to $30 billion worth of waste that can be ferreted out if you really push hard . But the Pentagon got a blank check . . . they got so goddamned greedy that they got themselves strung way out there on a limb . " <P> On Congressional reception of tax cuts : " Do you realize the greed that came to the forefront ? The hogs were really feeding . The greed level , the level of opportunism , just got out of control . The Administration 's basic strategy was to match or exceed the Democrats , and we did . " <P> On what was achieved by the Administration 's spending reductions : " There was less there than met the eye ... Let 's say that you and I walked outside and I waved a wand and said , I 've just lowered the temperature from 110 to 78 . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artificial CBO Congressional Budget Office base . That 's why it looked so big . But it was n't . " <P> On his recommendations for cuts in Social Security benefits : " Basically I screwed up quite a bit . "
