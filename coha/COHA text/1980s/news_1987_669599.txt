' ' What he has proposed is something very near treason , ' ' says Elias Zananiri , editor of the pro-Palestine Liberation Organization East Jerusalem weekly , Al-Awdah. // These are harsh words about a man who , two years ago , was acceptable to the PLO , Jordan , the United States , and Israel as a member of a planned Jordanian-Palestinian peace negotiating team. // Mr. Siniora is the first Palestinian to run for the city ' s 31-seat municipal council since Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and annexed it despite international outcries . Running for the municipal council , nationalists argue , implies Palestinian acceptance of Israel ' s continued rule over East Jerusalem. // // ' ' If there is any danger , Mr. Siniora is responsible for putting himself in such a position , ' ' Mr. Zananiri says. // By the end of last week , Siniora appeared to be back-tracking somewhat on his proposed candidacy , after the PLO issued a statement saying it ' ' categorically rejected ' ' the idea . Siniora then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Europe whether his candidacy for the municipal council would imply the relinquishment of Palestinian claims to sovereignty over East Jerusalem . If the experts advised him that it would endanger Palestinian claims , Siniora said , he would ' ' freeze ' ' his proposal. // Meanwhile , Zananiri and other Palestinian nationalists say they have been disenchanted with Siniora for months and argue that he never represented a majority Palestinian view . The dissatisfaction with Siniora turned to outrage after the June 5 announcement of his candidacy. // Siniora himself says that he does not accept Israeli annexation and would incorporate into his political platform a demand that East Jerusalem be returned to Arab sovereignty and eventually be made the capital of a Palestinian state. // ' ' Siniora ' s announcement threatens the national cause of our people , ' ' Zananiri maintains . ' ' It threatens a core issue - Jerusalem. ' ' // Siniora is weathering the storm of criticism from across the Palestinian political spectrum with outward calm. // ' ' There is a political stalemate now , ' ' he said in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did it because I care for the future of my people , to focus the issue on the crucial point that will make or break any peaceful resolution of the Palestine conflict - the future of Jerusalem . I wanted to show Israelis that there are not 135 , 000 ghosts in East Jerusalem - there are Palestinian people and they will use tools to exert their political influence if Israel continues to hold on to Jerusalem. ' ' // ( Though most Arab residents of Jerusalem have retained Jordanian citizenship , they are eligibile to vote . Many have refused to do so in protest against what they view as Israeli occupation. ) // Siniora ' s plan to enter the Israeli political system and work from within to wrest concessions from Israel was first floated last year by Sari Nusseibeh , a Palestinian philosophy professor . Dr. Nusseibeh is dismissed by most Palestinian activists as an academic dreamer. // Nusseibeh suggested that the 1. 4 million Palestinians in the occupied territories should first push for Israeli annexation of the areas , then insist on full citizenship rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nusseibeh held , once Palestinians achieved the vote , they soon would be able , in effect , to vote the Zionist state out of existence. // Nusseibeh ' s theory was regarded as a purely intellectual exercise . But Siniora is seen by some Palestinian nationalists as a more threatening figure because he has been the focus of foreign and Israeli media interest since being named by the PLO two years ago to a proposed Jordanian-Palestinian peace negotiating team. // Siniora ' s appointment was accepted by then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres . Siniora came to be regarded by the press and middle-of-the-road Israelis as the sort of ' ' authentic ' ' Palestinian Mr. Peres was seeking , one who could sit with Israel in peace talks with the PLO ' s backing. // But the soft-spoken , bespectacled **30;47292;TOOLONG - a member of the tiny Palestinian Roman Catholic community - never had a base of support within the factionalized Palestinian community . In the past two years , Siniora has been criticized by Palestinian nationalists who thought his views were growing unacceptably moderate . The announcement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last straw . It has left Siniora isolated and under attack . A pro-Jordanian East Jerusalem newspaper quoted a respected sheikh denouncing Siniora ' s idea as an attack on Islam ' s claim to Jerusalem . Even Rashad Shawa , mayor of Israeli-occupied Gaza , who has broken with nationalist consensus in the past and criticized the PLO , denounced the plan. // The last time Palestinian nationalist circles have shown such outrage , one Palestinian journalist remarked , was in 1977 when then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat flew to Jerusalem . Sadat eventually paid for that initiative with his life , when he was assassinated by Islamic fanatics opposed to the 1979 peace treaty he signed with Israel. // ' ' I really believe that Hanna sees himself as some sort of Sadat , ' ' says a Palestinian journalist . ' ' Not on the same scale , of course , but a leader as Sadat was a leader . There was stalemate in the region when Sadat decided to break ( it ) and come to Jerusalem . Hanna thought he could break the stalemate that exists now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own people , and he has aborted the idea before it was born. ' ' // In Palestinian politics , the most cherished and elusive goal is consensus , normally achieved by seeking the lowest common denominator among views ranging from Islamic fundamentalist to Marxist . Perhaps Siniora ' s biggest miscalculation has been to flout that consensus. // ' ' Siniora knew in advance that his suggestion would not be accepted by the Palestinians , ' ' Zananiri wrote in Al-Awdah . ' ' That is why he resorted to a different tactic of mobilizing support for himself . He resorted to the Israeli and world media , choosing to bypass his own people. ' ' // Siniora says he did discuss his idea with other Palestinians before launching it at a meeting between Palestinian , Israeli , and foreign journalists to discuss the impact of 20 years of Israeli occupation on Palestinians . But had he waited for consensus , he says , the idea would never have gotten off the ground. // ' ' We have been in the same cycle for too long . I hope my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' I could have stayed silent many times , followed the official ( PLO ) line and safeguarded my position. ' ' // But , he continues , ' ' I made up my mind that I would undertake to inject something new . Staying silent is being negligent of your national duties to start some change. ' ' // //
