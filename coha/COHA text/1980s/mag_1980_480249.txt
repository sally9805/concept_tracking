are once again upon us . They do not yet rage openly , but beneath the surface of recent American events can be felt the gathering strength of attitudes and emotions that permit us to think about war in ways that were impossible even a year ago . We hear almost daily the militant pronouncements of our political candidates and news of escalating appropriations for arms . We seem to be witnessing the remilitarization of America , a process that has not yet brought us to the brink of war , but has already established in many minds the groundwork for war : a revitalized sense of our moral superiority , a heightened fear of the malevolent forces surrounding us , and a belief in our capacity to temper our use of violence . Whether it be the Nicaraguan revolution , the hostage crisis , the rise in OPEC prices , the Russian invasion of Afghanistan , or the fighting in Iraq and Iran , our inability to control events and our inept response to them have demanded from us a rethinking of our political and moral relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , we have lapsed happily into the familiar attitudes that marked the Cold War in the Fifties and the Asian debacle of the Sixties : we clench our fists and mutter comforting platitudes to ourselves , cheerfully lost among the same illusions that proved so disastrous a decade ago . It is fashionable now , in some circles , to see this renewed military hubris as both inevitable and necessary . We are told that we are merely leaving behind , as we must , guilt that paralyzed us for a decade after the war in Vietnam . But that , I think , misstates the case . What paralyzed us was not simply the guilt felt about Vietnam , but our inability to confront and comprehend that guilt : our refusal to face squarely what happened and why , and our unwillingness to determine , in the light of the past , our moral obligations for the future . In short , we spent a decade denying and evading guilt rather than using it to our advantage . Yet the moral quandaries remain . Vietnam is with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eating at others , pushed out of sight but present in the various shames we feel as we look at the flag , in our naive dreams of easy peace or our violent fantasies of virtue and power . Sometimes , for a moment , one gets glimpses of the barely hidden anger and guilt . When , for instance , California 's Gov . Jerry Brown appointed Jane Fonda to the state 's arts council and the state senate refused to ratify the appointment , the air was filled suddenly with violent response . To the senators , Ms. Fonda was " a traitor " ; to her , Peter Marin recently received a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation . He is currently at work on a book to be called Conscience and the Common Good . they were fascists . One could feel the sudden , brutal , and still unresolved memory of the war . The same volatility appears in private conversations . Mention Vietnam , the veterans , guilt , or responsibility , and the air becomes rife with accusations , defenses , justifications , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also within each one of us : each of us lives with the sense of having left undone a series of tasks we can neither name nor understand , but which we know with a terrible intensity constitute the war 's legacy . None of us has faced the specter of his own culpability ? not Nixon 's , not Kissinger 's ? but the way in which each one of us , actively or passively , contributed to the killing , the taxes we paid , officials we elected , lessons we taught in the classroom , obedience we taught , the endless round of incipient and explicit influences that made countless young men willing to kill for the worst of causes in the worst of ways . We have skirted the sort of passionate and open self-investigation that members of a democratic society must conduct to protect others from themselves , a rethinking of values and allegiances that have had brutal effects . In setting the war aside we have failed to push ourselves far enough , failed to raise the crucial questions about ourselves that we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stories about veterans that are now in vogue with the newspapers , the stories that dissect the veteran 's psyche as if prying apart a laboratory frog ? patronizing stories written by style-section reporters who know all there is to know about chocolate mousse , ladies ' fashions , and the wonderful desserts that can be made with simple jello . I weary of seeing veterans analyzed and diagnosed and explained by people who share nothing with veterans , by people who , one feels intuitively , would regard it as a harrowing experience to be alone in a backyard . Week after week the mousse authorities tell us what is wrong with the veteran . The veteran is badly in need of adjustment , they say ? lacks balance , needs fine tuning to . to confront . We have failed to indicate that we will be much different from what we have been in the past . We have had our texts , that is true . Book after book about the war has come off the presses , placing blame , analyzing causes , condemning Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But most of these seem to have missed the point , ascribing to the war political errors or the excess of a few men , as if all of us in America had somehow been fooled into fighting . That was not the case at all , of course . Though resisted from the start , the war was a popular one ; we reelected Nixon in the middle of it , and we were led further into it not so much by lies as by our nationalistic sense of unsullied virtue and by the difficulty we have in seeing the reality of events , the justice of others ' causes , or the suffering we inflict upon them . Few of the books on Vietnam raise the questions we should have faced : the full extent of the atrocities committed and the participation in those atrocities of ordinary soldiers , ordinary citizens , and ordinary children . The Vietnam novels seem even more completely encapsulated in American myths , even when the war is seen in all its absurdity . No novelist seems yet to have been willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . What we have here , all agree , with omniscience and veiled condescension , is a victim : The press loves a victim . The veteran has bad dreams , say the jello writers , is alienated , may be hostile , does n't socialize well ? is n't , to be frank , quite right in the head . But perhaps it is the veteran 's head to be right or wrong in , and maybe it makes a difference what memories are in the head . For the jello writers the war was a moral fable on Channel Four , a struggle hinging on Nixon and Joan Baez and the inequities of this or that . I ca n't be sure . The veterans seem to have missed the war by having been away in Vietnam at the time and do not understand the combat as it raged in the internecine cocktail parties of Georgetown . Still , to me Vietnam was not what it was to the jello writers , not a ventilation of pious simplisms , not the latest literary interpretation of the domino theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine . It was the slums of Truong Minh Ky , where dogs ' heads floated in pools of green water and three-inch roaches droned in swelterconfront , directly , the realities of the war , or to have considered it , at least in part , from the Vietnamese point of view ? in terms of their suffering rather than ours . The same cultural bias that has traditionally marked our attitudes toward other races seems to be still at work . The novels , for the most part , are jumpy and surrealistic ; it is difficult , for example , to distinguish the tone or setting of Tim O'Brien 's Going After Cacciato from Joseph Heller 's Catch-22 or Richard Hooker 's MASH . The books reveal something about our soldiers ' states of mind and about the corruption of our institutions , but they seem to be the work of distraught and alienated men who are unable to locate any sort of vision or binding values . Though they issue from men of obvious sense and feeling , they seem almost universally lacking in both tragic dimension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than stick-figures in an American dream . It is hard , reading them , to find in oneself much hope for an American future , save the skepticism and irony about authority that has become a national characteristic and saving grace . There are exceptions to all this , of course : Gloria Emerson 's Winners and Losers , Frances FitzGerald 's Fire in the Lake , or Ron Kovic 's Born on the Fourth of July . Yet none of thesebooks , for all their obvious passion and truth , suggests a way out of our present moral predicament or confronts the reader with his own responsibilities . Only Gloria Emerson , inconsolable in her rage and grief , manages to communicate that we , as a people , have no right to move on without confronting our past and , in its context , determining our future . There are , too , the veterans among us , enigmatic and for the most part silent , harboring the truths the rest of us do not want to hear . We have statistics on their suicide rate and the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality behind those figures , with what the vets saw and did , or were asked to do , and how the permutations of guilt ( the guilt they feel , the guilt we deny ) are at work within them . Here , too , silence reigns , perhaps in large part because we discourage the vets. from speaking by refusing to listen . Even when the vets protest or speak out , they have little to say about the war itself . They almost always voice their own grievances : how they were treated , the paucity of their benefits , the refusal of their countrymen to pay attention to them . Their protests against Agent Orange are solely personal ; they never remind us ( nor do we care to remember ) what the poison must also have done and be doing to generations of Vietnamese .

The mousse authorities do not remember this . I remember the villa on Monivong in Phnom Penh , with Seailacek , the balding Australian hippie , and Naoki , the crazy freelance combat photographer , and Zoco , the Frenchman , when the night r jumped and flickered with the boom of artillery and we listened to Mancini on shortwave and watched Nara dance . Washington 's elite did not know Nara . They know much of politicians and of furniture . If I try to explain what Vietnam meant to have n't for years , and never will again ? they grow uneasy at my intensity . My God , their eyes say , he sounds as though ? he liked it over there . Something in the experience clearly snapped an anchoring ligament in his mind and left him with odd cravings , a perverse view of life ? nothing dangerous , of course , but .. . . The war did that to them , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may have something there . When you have seen a peasant mother screaming over three pounds of bright red mush that , thanks to God and a Chicom 107 , is no longer precisely her child , you see that Sherman may have been on to something . When you have eaten fish with Khmer troops in charred Cambodian battlefields , where the heat heats down like a soft rubber truncheon and a wretched stink comes from shallow graves , no particular leap of imagination is necessary to notice that war is no paradise . I can not say that the jello writers are wrong in their understanding of war . But somehow I do n't like hearing pieties about the war from these sleek , wise people who never saw it . It offends propriety . There were , of course , veterans and veterans . Some hated the war , some did n't . Some went around the bend down in IV Corps , where leeches dropped softly down collars like green ; sausages and death erupted unexpected from the ungodly foliage . To they avoid , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to terms with what went on in Vietnam ? the killing and the attendant guilt ? and the fact that neither they nor we know how to respond to those realities . The distortions of film IS WITH ALL OF that in mind that I began , a year or two ago , to go to each of the Vietnam films produced by Hollywood . I did not expect to find much there , of course . But some of the films were being made by serious men and women with aesthetic skills and some political insight ; more important , Americans were apparently taking them seriously . Even intellectual critics and commentators were treating the films as if they would not only reveal to us something about ourselves and the way we see ourselves , but would also define for us , at a popular level , our memories and attitudes about the war . The films seemed to have a certain importance as texts ; that is , they seemed , on the surface , to have been prepared with as much the men in the elite groups ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who spent years in the Khmer bush , low to the ground where the ants bit hard ? the war was a game with stakes high enough to engage their attention . They liked to play . To many of us there , the war was the best time of our lives , almost the only time . We loved it because in those days we were alive , life was intense , the pungent hours passed fast over the central event of the age and the howling jets appeased the terrible boredom of existence . Psychologists , high priests of the mean , say that boredom is a symptom of maladjustment ; maybe , but boredom has been around longer than psychologists have . The jello writers would say we are mad to remember fondly anything about Nixon 's war that Kennedy started . They do not remember the shuddering flight of a helicopter high over glowing green jungle that spread beneath us like a frozen sea . They never made the low runs a foot above treetops along paths that led like rivers through branches that clawed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception as the best books about the war . With film , at least , we might break our shared silence , forcing ourselves ? en masse ? to look at the past we had previously avoided . The texts might be in a way popular stations of the cross , stages on our ambiguous journey toward the truths of Vietnam . I saw perhaps a dozen films , among them Apocalypse Now , Dog Soldiers , Go Tell the Spartans , Heroes , The Boys in Company C , Coming Home , The Deerhunter , Who 'll Stop the Rain , and Taxi Driver ( which , though not classed as a Vietnam film , more successfully communicates the war 's continuation at home than any other film ) . There were perceptive moments in almost all of them . Heroes , for instance , had a few marvelous scenes of vets back at home together ; The Boys in Company C was dominated by a black street hero ? something relatively rare and generous ; and a few prebattle conversations in Go Tell the Spartans echoed , convincingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part , the films owe more to other films than they do to the war . It is , in fact , difficult to remember while watching them that there actually was a war , or that its causes and consequences might have something to do with one 's own life . The most significant Vietnam films were Apocalypse Now , The Deerhunter , and ? to a and bubbling swamps of sucking snake-ridden muck . They do not remember monsoon mornings in the highlands where dragons of mist twisted in the valleys , coil- ; rig lazily on themselves , puffing up and swallowing whole villages in their dank breath . The mousse men do not remember driving before dawn to Red Beach , when the headlights in the blackness caught ghostly shapes , maybe VC , thin yellow men mushroom-headed in the night , bicycling along the alien roads . As nearly as I can tell , jello writers do not remember anything . Then it was over . The veterans came home . Suddenly the world seemed to stop dead in the water . Suddenly the slant-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild drunken nights in places that the jello writers ca n't picture . Suddenly the veterans were among soft , proper people who knew nothing of what they had done and what they had seen , and who , truth to be told , did n't much like them . Nor did some of us much like the people at home ? though it was not at first a conscious distaste . Men came home with wounds and terrible memories and dead lesser degree ? Coming Home . These were not necessarily the best or most intelligent films . But they were more than films ; they were events . Despite the fact that they failed to confront the moral issues of the war , they were treated with the same seriousness and granted the same attentiveness that we ordinarily reserve for important books ; many regarded them as summary statements about the war , which tells us something about ourselves , if not about Vietnam . The Deerhunter 's faults were immediately visible and well-documented . Most notable among them were director Michael Cimino 's intentional misrepresentations of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or brutality , and a xenophobia and racism as extravagant as anything to be found on the screen since our secondworld-war films about the Japanese . And yet , for all of that , certain parts seem to me more moving and memorable than any of the other films about the war . Cimino shows more humanity , more respect and generosity , toward his American characters than one can find , for instance , in either Coming Home or Apocalypse Now . Somehow his vision , despite the reactionary politics behind it , has a tenderness missing from those films that are more strongly against the war . friends to be eeted by that squalling she-ass of Tom Hayden 's , to find a country that viewed them as criminals . Slowly , to more men than will admit to it , the thought came : These are the people I fought for ? And so we lost a country . We looked around us with new eyes and saw that in a sense the mousse people could never understand , we had lost even our dignity . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wounds healed , had to run errands for the nurses , last year 's co-eds . " A hell of a bust , " he said with the military 's sardonic economy of language . " Machine gunner to messenger boy . " It was n't exactly that we did n't fit . Rather , we saw what there was to fit with , ? and recoiled . We sought jobs , but found offices where countless bureaucrats shuffled papers at long rows of desks , like battery hens awaiting the laying urge , their bellies billowing over their belts . Some of us joined them but some , in different ways , fled . A gunship pilot of my acquaintance took to the law , and to drink , and spent five years disco , ing that he really wanted to be in The best parts of the film are those set in America , in and around the Pennsylvania steel town that is home to three friends ( Robert DeNiro , Christopher Walken , John Savage ) preparing to leave for Vietnam . Something powerful and lovely comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking , hunting , and celebrating together : Cimino 's respect and love for his characters , a clarity of perception that brings persons and landscape sharply alive . Cimino has a fine eye and is faithful to what he sees ; he captures the slant of light on a deserted avenue , or a tavern 's interior , or the startling purity of the hills outside of town . One feels , suddenly , the poignant and bittersweet pleasures of American lives led far from the centers of power : their loveliness , their loneliness , their fundamental innocence . Cimino 's central subject , after all , is innocence ? his characters ' and our own . His film confers upon his viewers a sort of absolution for Vietnam , returning to them precisely the illusion of superior virtue that ought to have been wiped away by the war . He has organized his film cunningly around the traditional literary theme of innocence versus decadence , small-town and wilderness virtues opposed to urban corruption . It is a familiar theme , one to which we respond without Rhodesia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard old rules still held . I drifted across Asia , Mexico , Wyoming , hitchhiking and sleeping in ditches a lot until I learned that aberrant behavior , when written about , is literature . The jello writers were quickly upon us . We were morose , they said , sullen . We acted strangely at parties , sat silently in corners and watched with noncommittal stares . Mentally , said the fashion experts , we had n't made the trip home . It did n't occur to them that we just had nothing to say about jello . Desserts mean little to men who have lain in dark rifle pits over Happy Valley in rainy season , watching mortar flares tremble in low-lying clouds that flickered like the face of God , while in the nervous evening safeties clicked off the wire and amtracs rumbled into alert idles , coughing and waiting . Once , after the GIs had left Saigon , I came out of a bar on Cach Mang and saw a veteran with a sign on his jacket : VIET NAM : IF YOU HAVE N'T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just maybe , he had something . thought , and Cimino 's use of it is both intelligent and perverse . His comforting moral equations mask the truths of the war by reversing them completely ; innocent Americans become the war 's only victims , and the Vietnamese ? in reality an agrarian , village people ? become the big-city villains , smiling devils , corrupt gamblers , street-wise pimps and whores . The irony is that the very same virtues Cimino ascribes to Americans ? those in whose name America tried to destroy Vietnam ? lie at the heart of the culture we brutalized . It is not clear whether Cimino is oblivious to this , or is lying about it intentionally . What is at work here is probably a simple form of aesthetic ignorance or greed : the notion that if something " works " it must be all right , for there is no other standard of judgment . Cimino has the talent almost to bring it off . He makes us forget , as we watch his film , that things were other than they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when one considers the actual causes of the war and the film 's brute blindness to all but white American Christianity , that the extent of the film 's cruelty ? not only to the Vietnamese , but to the Americans Cimino supposedly loves ? becomes clear . A decade from now , in foreign nations whose names we barely know at the moment , where death is real , young men like those in Cimino 's film will die again , in part because of the myth he has manufactured in privileged safety . F THOSE ON THE political Right can be simpleminded and reductive in their pursuit of virtue , so can those on the Left . The smugness and self-satisfaction at work in Coming Home , for which both director Hal Ashby and actress Jane Fonda are responsible , are almost as destructive to genuine thought or feeling as elements in The Deerhunter . Nancy Dowd , who wrote the film 's screenplay , was reportedly outraged by what was done to her script , and one can see why . What may well have begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems of returning veterans is reduced to a ritualized love story and a vehicle for Ms. Fonda 's perpetual moral posturing . Ms. Fonda plays a young housewife married to a patriotic army officer ( Bruce Dern ) anxious to be shipped to Vietnam . When hegoes overseas , she volunteers to work in a veterans ' hospital and meets a paraplegic vet ( Jon Voigt ) vehemently opposed to the war . They argue at first , then grow closer , and finally become lovers . A sexual metamorphosis begins : Ms. Fonda 's hair comes down ; her pantsuits give way to jeans ; she has marvelous orgasms and turns against the war . Then Dern returns , slightly wounded and disillusioned by the war , and learns he has been cuckolded . Inconsolable , he kills himself by swimming out to sea . At the film 's end we find Voigt , who will now live happily ever after with Ms. Fonda , lecturing a high-school class about the evils of war . There are a few shots in the film that ring eerily true : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few wounded vets argue about the war ; a scene or two on an army base , where officers and wives carry on in the foolish innocence that accompanies American brutality ; and , when Dern returns home , a scene at an airfield with bodies stacked high in bags and a forklift ready to handle them . But such moments are washed away by what surrounds them ; everything else in the film seems thin and contrived , unrelentingly smug , a cross between Hollywood tripe and Chinese opera ? villains punished , virtue rewarded , and the lovers riding ? or rather one riding , the other pushing ? into the sunset . One finds every event and issue oversimplified , distorted by a peculiar greed for virtue and the need to be wholly right ? as if good were never partial , or motive and consequence never ambiguous . This is not only bad art ; it is also bad politics . In the name of goodness it feeds precisely the wrong hungers in the audience , makes no real demand upon it , renders fantastical the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral realm to a set of smug attitudes and banalities . ND WHAT CAN ONE make of Apocalypse Now , supposedly the ultimate Vietnam film ? It is hard to get at the film itself , so surrounded has it been by Coppola 's self-congratulating pronouncements about its significance . I have friends who think the film is marvelous and that as time passes it will become a classic . But it seems to me to be morally inert at its center , morally stupid ? not a " failed masterpiece , " as its critics have classed it , but an essentially unintelligent investigation of themes too complex for Coppola to handle ; not the emperor without clothes , but all the clothes with no emperor inside . Loosely patterned after Joseph Conrad 's novel Heart of Darkness , the film is an attempt to use the novel 's themes , structure , and narrative devices to create what Coppola has called " a moral fable , " not only about the war , but about every confrontation between " civilized " and " primitive " cultures . Lieutenant Willard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Conrad 's narrator , Marlowe ) is ordered by his superiors in Saigon to travel upriver into what is apparently Cambodia and assassinate a Colonel Kurtz ( Marlon Brand ? ) , a brilliant officer who has turned renegade and surrounded himself with an army of local tribesmen . Traveling first by helicopter and then by boat , Willard passes through a series of disconnected adventures , each of which reveals a different aspect of the war . With the sole surviving member of the boat 's crew , he reaches Kurtz 's compound and finds him alternately lucid and mad , reciting T. S. Eliot , reading The Golden Bough , and talking a sophomoric line of philosophy hard for the viewer ? but not for Willard ? to take seriously . Supposedly caught between admiration and revulsion for Kurtz , Willard eventually kills him ? not for his superiors ' reasons , but for his own . At the film 's end we see him starting on his long journey home . presumably to deliver to Kurtz 's young son the message Kurtz has sent him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful images , a few sequences in which Coppola captures the hallucinatory and dreamlike quality of the war , a conceptual sweep that sometimes breaks into a brilliant and savage clarity , and technical proficiency in camera work and sound effects that has awed many people in the film industry . There are moments when Coppola , obviously in his element , is like an obsessed painter at work , using the screen and his technical mastery to create memorable effects that convince one , for a moment , that one is watching a great film . But Coppola 's technical skills and his eye for detail are not matched by his moral imagination . Something is missing here : the depth , coherence , and generosity of vision that mark the great moral texts of the sort that Coppola hoped to make . The best moments of the film are depreciated by sudden shifts of tone or attitude and lapses of intelligence ; one can feel , behind the film , Coppola struggling with his footage and his ideas , trying to piece together from four years of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused aspect of his attitude toward the war . We are given , essentially , a kind of sampler , a variety show of Coppola 's talents : bits and pieces of successive scripts , fragments of John MMus 's originally hawkish screenplay , Michael Herr 's antiwar narrative added late in the day , set pieces of surreal exaggeration derivative of Catch-22 or MASH , mawkish images of the Vietnamese , and , finally , the entire last convulsive third of the film , a pastiche of borrowed meanings and second-hand myths , in which Coppola , striving to locate the significance of his work , loses his way completely . The film is crippled by a morally incoherent attitude toward the war and its attendant issues . What supposedly holds the film together is the narrative explanation delivered by Sheen and accompanying the action . But this device , borrowed from Conrad , is as ineffective as it is desperate ; if one listens carefully to it , it seems sophomoric and silly , pasted onto the action like a label onto a bottle , a way of trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought nor the film 's implications . What obsessed Conrad was not only the visible nature of men 's acts but the struggle men waged inside themselves to remain decent or to find something substantial and worthy of respect : virtue or truth to hold against the darkness . Coppola recognizes the pertinence of this theme to the American experience in Vietnam , but he fails to understand how Conrad makes it work , and nowhere is this more evident than in the film 's last third . Here , for the film to work at all , its moral meanings must deepen and extend themselves , enveloping the audience , locating themselves finally not only in the war , nor even in something as abstract or general as the human heart , but in each one of us , in our actual lives , in the battle living men and women wage against their own savagery . Coppola never manages this shift ; one wonders whether he knows it is supposed to occur . In the last part of his film he borrows wildly : from Conrad , from Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he discovered midway through the film . Even the most powerful images in this section seem derivative , reminiscent of those in Werner Herzog 's Aguirre , the Wrath of God , a film with similar themes handled more imaginatively . But all of these sources , which have in their original versions a force of their own , seem emptied here of moral significance ; they fail to touch or move us , or to have much to do with the real world or our actual lives . S IT TOO MUCH , I wonder , to demand from cinema what one would from books : seriousness and depth of vision equal to both their subjects and the possibilities of human nature ? The truly great films about war do far more than the directors attempt or accomplish in the films in question here . Jean Renoir 's Grand Illusion or the film of Erich Maria Remarque 's All Quiet on the Western Front not only educate us to the horrors of war but also offer us something be . lievable and real to hold against them : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a vision of the possibility of human allegiances more worthy of a man 's devotion than the passions of war or the powers of the state . The vision , the humanity , one finds at the heart of such films is far more restorative and profound than anything at work in our Hollywood films . One thinks of the scene in All Quiet on the Western Front in which the narrator-soldier , having bayoneted a Frenchman , sits all night with him in a trench as he dies , gradually becoming obsessed with the idea of somehow taking the Frenchman 's place after the war , as if in atonement for the human solidarity he has violated by killing . Or one thinks of the friendships conveying the main themes of Grand Illusion : between French and German officers , between French aristocrat and working-class Jew . In both cases one is offered as an alternative to war the possibility of a human allegiance or solidarity that reaches across the boundaries established by war and replaces the arrogance of certitude with a humbler sense of partial truths , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great moral art , as well as to a nation 's moral life , is the capacity to understand two elusive truths : first , that our actions occur in a real world and have immeasurable consequences for countless others , and , second , that those suffering others are also real ? not emblems , not symbols , not abstractions , not even merely " Vietnamese " or " Iranians " or " Communists " or " militants " ? but concrete persons in specific situations , men and women with lives and needs as real as our own . Yet that , precisely , is what seems missing from these films : the capacity to stretch the aesthetic imagination far enough to include within the moral realm actual others in a real world . They are , instead , examples of what I would call an " imperial " art , one befitting the citizens of a powerful , declining empire by allowing us the luxury of " facing " reality while covertly and consolingly denying our role within it . Supposedly challenged , we are secretly soothed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how happy we are to see the progress blacks have made , how self-satisfied now that we have had a program about them , and how oblivious , still , to the ghetto horrors in our midst . The real problem with these films , I suspect , has something to do with the inadequacy of the visual image in dealing with political , historical , and , especially , moral matters . The interiority of events ? both their inner , subjective significance and their concrete political meanings ? is ordinarily preserved or created through language ; but it is often lost when , as in these films , events are reduced to the merely visual . As Susan Sontag has argued in her work on photography , the reduction of experience to image tends somehow to bleed it of value and reflective power . Photography 's flattening of moral content and its confusion of made objects with " reality " is intensified in cinema by the size of the screen , the verisimilitude of the action , and the increased possibilities for manipulation . Cinema tends toward the hypnotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medium , film almost always neutralizes the audience 's capacity for skepticism and moral reflection ? this is particularly true in films attempting to deal with history directly . ITHOUT LANGUAGE history becomes meaningless . The proper vehicle for moral meaning and concern is speech ; it is not only the words themselves but our sense of the human speaker that remind us in the midst of events of their human significance . In the great moral texts , whether book or film , it is only the believability and power of the human voice that engage us completely in the work . One thinks of the great war novels : War and Peace , Parade 's End , The Cluzrterhouse of Parma , All Quiet on the Western Front . The meaning of all these books inheres not only in action and plot ; it is , far more , the quality and tone of language , the narrative voice , and our sense of a speaker ( either the narrator or the characters ) that create in each of us a resonance or a response . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Hiroshima , Mon Amour or All Quiet on the Western Front it is the human voice that somehow breaks the fictional and imagistic frame of reference ; it seems to issue simultaneously from a world outside the film and inside ourselves , reminding us of a human reality larger than the film , one we ourselves inhabit ? not as an audience , but as moral participants . But the verbal absurdities of the Vietnam films amount to a kind of moral muteness in which the reality of events and the humanity of those involved vanish completely . If one listens to as well as watches these films , one discovers that nothing within them spoken or thought is intelligent enough to be taken seriously . People " say " things , of course . But what they say- is so infantile , so manipulative , or so obviously present merely to move the plot along that we are demeaned as we watch . There is something both tragic and ironic in this , for rarely has an American experience been marked by as much reflection , clarity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Side by side with America 's acceptance of the war , and behind the mass demonstrations of protest , lay something altogether different and equally important : the willingness of many Americans ? most of them very young ? to determine for themselves the answers to the most serious questions human beings can face , those pertaining to obedience and rebellion , others ' lives and deaths , the pull of conflicting allegiances , and the nature and cost of moral life . It was a decade of genuine moral heroism , serious moral speech , not only in the endless conversations among comrades and peers or the spoken and printed criticism of the war and the state but also in the inward debates men hold with themselves about what it is just or best to do . That was true not only of those who resisted the war but also of those who fought in it . Though many young men participated mindlessly , countless others , even in the middle of battle , made anguishing moral choices , the nature of which ? given our present silence ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of fear but in disgust ; others refused orders ; a few went over to the other side . A few sabotaged our side : vets have told me about firing continuously and intentionally over the enemy 's heads . Everywhere in the war , even among many of those who determined for themselves that it was right to fight , one found genuine moralanguish , genuine moral seriousness , and a depth and clarity of reflection that put to shame the theatrical , vacuous moral imagination one finds in the Vietnam films . ND THE SAME moral seriousness prevails among the vets . In the past several months , trying to find ways - to assess these films , I talked at length to many of them about the war . Not all of them wanted to say much about it , and most omitted the details . But time and again a few reluctant or cautious words about grief , anger , or fear revealed more about the specific nature of the war and its particular horrors than could the sound and fury of all these films . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his return to the States . He had been a part of what he called an " assassination squad , " spending long periods of time on his own , out of touch with both his superiors and comrades , apparently working independently on his assigned tasks . He described coming home in a series of almost surrealistic vignettes : being lectured in the airport by an officer for playing cards with his buddies and " giving the service a bad name " ; being asked by the first civilian he had met in months about " them niggers in the army , the ones too chicken-shit to fight " ; falling asleep in his seat and then waking from a nightmare of war , shaking and sweating , to find that everyone close to him had moved several seats away ; and , finally , meeting his parents at the airport and finding it impossible to speak . They drove home in silence and then sat together in the kitchen , and his mother , in passing , apologized for there being " nothing in the house to eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went from cupboard to cupboard , shelf to shelf , flinging doors open , pulling down cans and boxes and bags , piling them higher and higher on the table until they spilled over onto the floor and everything edible in the house was spread out in front of them . " I could n't believe it , " he said , shaking his head as he told me . " I 'd been over there for years , killing those poor bastards who were living in their tunnels like rats and had nothing to eat but mud and a few goddamn moldy grains of rice , and who watched their kids starve to death or go up in smoke , and she said nothing to eat , and I ended up in the kitchen crying and shouting : Nothing to eat , nothing to eat ! " This story is not particularly special ; I might have recounted a dozen others like it , some about the war itself , and more dramatic . But the point would be the same . No image , no technical effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and meaning of one man speaking quietly , telling the truth of his experience . The guilt-bearers among us T IS INEVITABLE , then , that we come to the veterans themselves . If two of the keys to the comprehension of the past and the creation of the future are memory and speech , it is in their memories , and in the possibilities of their speech , that the antidotes to our silence and fantasy lie . It is their voices ? real voices , grounded in the real that may have the power to call us back from our illusions to the discomforting concreteness of our acts . The questions of silence and speech , which remain for the rest of us abstract and theoretical questions , are for our veterans personal quandaries , sources of personal pain ; at least some of them are forced by the circumstances of their lives to struggle inwardly , and apparently endlessly . with the problems all of us should but do not confront . The real issue , to put it bluntly , is guilt : how , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determine what it requires of us . We must concern ourselves with the discovery of fact , the location of responsibility , the discussion of causes , the acknowledgment of moral debt and how it might be repaid ? not in terms of who supposedly led us astray , but in terms of how each one of us may have contributed to the war or to its underlying causes . The " luirror " of war is really very easy to confront ; it demands nothing of us save the capacity not to flinch . But guilt and responsibility , if one takes them seriously , are something else altogether . For they imply a debt , something to be done , changed lives ? and that is much harder on both individuals and a nation , for it implies a moral labor as strenuous and demanding as the war that preceded it . Decades ago Karl Jaspers , the German philosopher who fled his country during the second world war , returned to Germany once the war was over and gave several lectures underthe title " The Question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people nor to find particular men to blame , but simply to establish the realms of discourse and thought in which , collectively and individually , they were responsible for reviewing their past acts and determining their future behavior . There are obvious differences between the Germans ' situation and our own , but Jaspers 's work is relevant to us , especially because we have spent so little time thinking about guilt productively . We , like the Germans , fought a war marked by racism , atrocities , and what many called genocide ; we too , as a people , actively supported or tolerated the annihilation of a civilian population ; we too watched our neighbors , brothers , and children devastate a nation in our name ; we too elected our leaders knowingly , welcomed their small reassuring lies , applauded the suppression of dissent at home , and were more concerned with our power than the suffering it caused ; and , finally , we too , in the war 's aftermath , have denied responsibility for what occurred , have pleaded ignorance , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Jaspers , are responsible for the acts of war , accountable for the personal and social acts that contribute to war long before it has begun : the distractions , evasions , failures of nerve and resistance , mindless enthusiasms and neutralities with which we replace our responsibilities as citizens , as moral agents . In this regard each of us is guilty or , at least , guilty enough to share the burden of guilt that we happily assign , after the war , to those leaders and soldiers we ourselves produced . Jaspers distinguished among four kinds of guilt : criminal , political , moral , and metaphysical . The first two types are essentially simple . Criminal law involves civil law ; judgment is made by a judge or jury . Political guilt involves the collective crimes of a state , its leaders or its citizens ; these are judged ? as at Nuremberg ? by the war 's victors in accordance with international conventions . But the second two kinds of guilt ? moral and metaphysical ? are far more complicated , for they involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is these judgments , made privately and communally , that determine a nation 's moral nature . It is quite possible , in Jaspers 's eyes , and sometimes necessary . for men who might be innocent in criminal and political terms to find themselves morally and metaphysically guilty , and to struggle to restore to themselves and to their community what they find missing from their moral lives . RAL GUILT , FOR Jaspers , involves the responsibility of all persons for all of their acts and the consequences of their acts ? even under orders , even in the midst of war . " It is never true , " he writes , " that ' orders are orders . ' Every deed remains subject to moral judgment . " He means every deed : not only the acts of those who gave or took orders but even the apparently innocuous acts of those who in civilian life contributed in any way to the institutions and social attitudes that made such violence possible . Even those not directly responsible for the war , even those who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country 's victims and their fellow-citizens ; to create a moral climate in which all individuals can examine the complexities of guilt and the nature of their moral obligations . " Moral guilt , " Jaspers writes , " can only truthfully be discussed in a loving struggle between men who maintain solidarity among themselves . " Metaphysical guilt , for Jaspers , has to do with the relation of man to God and the ways in which men have somehow betrayed their given covenant with Him . It refers to our fundamental failure , at work not only in war but ubiquitously , to extend our own sense of human reciprocity or responsibility past the ordinary limits of family or nation to include those unlike ourselves . With metaphysical guilt , as with moral guilt , the power of judgment belongs to each man in relation to himself ; he is answerable to both his own conscience and to God , and he remains responsible ? at the heart of his own privacy ? for setting right what he himself perceives as wrong . One might argue with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line between moral and metaphysical guilt is not as easily drawn as it is for Jaspers . But such arguments are not important . What is important is the fact that Jaspers takes guilt seriously and understands it as a natural and inevitable consequence of all human activity . Guilt has , for him , little to do with breast-beating and weeping , sackcloth and ashes . He does not see it , as we do in America , as a condition to be escaped or denied ; it has nothing to do with punishment . It is , rather , a kind of awareness , a form of acknowledgment , a way of so clearly seeing one 's relation to the past , and one 's past actions , that one is moved by reason and conscience to rethink and remake the nature ofone 's moral life . It is a practical matter , a kind of perceived debt requiring and impelling further action . It is , in a sense , a question men pose to themselves and which they answer with what they do with their lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with absolution or atonement . The dead , after all , remain dead . The maimed remain maimed . It is no more possible to " absolve " oneself of guilt than it is to bring the dead back to life or erase the suffering one has caused . But it is possible to live in the future in a way that makes sense of the past , and to restore to one 's life the moral legitimacy that has been lost . No man can determine for another precisely what it is that the other , in his own privacy , may find he must do ; but one can say that the legitimacy of all moral life depends on the willingness of men to struggle with such questions before they decide what to do . All men , like all nations , are tested twice in the moral realm : first by what they do , then by what they make of what they do . A condition of guilt , a sense of one 's own guilt , denotes a kind of second chance ; men are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to repay to the living what it is they find themselves owing the dead . Conscience endangered T IS OBVIOUS THAT these notions ? taken seriously would require from us much more , as individuals , than we have so far been willing to accept as part of the debt conferred upon us by the war . We would have to consider , above all else , the institutions , attitudes , and systems of authority that made possible both our actions in Vietnam and the willingness of our young men to partake in them . We would have to ask ourselves about the extent to which we were responsible not only for the war but for the schooling we give our young and the ways we encourage obedience and the suspension of moral judgment ? the violence and incipient racism at work in our streets and minds ; the myths and distractions of media that wrap us endlessly in dreams and fantasies ; the caste and class blindnesses that teach us , continuously , an indifference to all those unlike ourselves ; the tendency at work everywhere among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue and moral superiority for oneself , while casting one 's opponents as knaves ; and the failure of both our artists and thinkers to place at the heart of their concerns a passion for conscience or justice . Finally , in terms of " metaphysical " guilt , we would have to consider precisely what we believe one person owes another , or what he owes to which others , and how responsible each of us must be in relation to moral choice , especially in the face of what our country asks us to do . But these questions , which hung in the air for the war 's duration and ought now to inform the heart of every private existence , have ceased for most of us to have any power . The notion of conscience itself has become almost exotic ; genuinely moral concerns , genuinely moral lives , have become so rare among us that they seem eccentric . I remember once talking to a psychologist who worked for the Veterans ' Administration . I asked him how he and his colleagues dealt with the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " It does not exist for us . For us , everything is a problem in adjustment . " How different would it be anywhere else in our culture ? What has changed radically in the last several decades is not so much our behavior , but how we think about it : the ways we measure action and its consequences , and how we hold ourselves or one another responsible for things . One can search in vain these days ? not only in therapeutic texts , but in those dealing with morality or politics ? for the word conscience . Our philosophers long ago reduced ethical questions to problems in epistemology , and even oui . religions have ceased to offer us much in this realm , concerned as they are with the problems of salvation rather than the complexities of concrete moral life in the real world . The veterans ' private wars HIS , IN PART , IS what makes our veterans so important . The vets know conscience exists ; they are immersed in it . They face daily , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions that at best remain abstract for the rest of us . In a sense , they are still walking point for us , confronting a landscape as alien as anything they faced in Vietnam , still doing for the rest of us the dangerous tasks that we pretend do not exist . Guilt , I know , is not the only possible explanation for the pain and rage they feel . Obviously , they suffer not only the alienation experienced by the participants of any war but also problems unique to the war in Vietnam : their disappointment at their treatment at home ; their anger at the absence of gratitude , attention , respect , or aid ; their resentment at having risked their lives and seen men die in a war now regretted or forgotten . But behind all of that , and mixed inextricably with it , is something more , something perhaps not even privately admitted : the anger of the veterans at themselves , their grief at having fought and killed in the wrong war , for the wrong reasons , in the wrong way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus troubled . Despite everything written about it , the war remains , still , a mystery for most of us . We can not know precisely what went on , how frequently atrocities occurred , bow many men and women were wantonly slaughtered or raped , how many villages were carelessly destroyed ? or how many of our soldiers were directly involved . But certainly all of that plays a part in what many of our veterans now suffer . I am thinking not only of the outspoken and angry veterans such as the Vietnam Veterans Against the War but also about all those others in whom shame and guilt may take a disguised and unrecognizable form : the suicides reported and unreported ; the cases of addiction , criminality , depression , schizophrenia , and all those other conditions that may be in part maladies of conscience ; the drifters and drinkers and compulsive talkers and weepers one can find in the cheap hotels and taverns of any American city ; the armed and angry vets one finds in southern and mountain states awaiting Armageddon and hating both their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps especially ) the " well-adjusted " who go about their daily business without apparent doubt or dread or drama , who never speak about the war but who wake alone in the dark dreaming of war , caught in its terrors still . No doubt complex forces are at work in all of these instances , but who can doubt that in all of them conscious or unconscious guilt plays a part ? Even in the cases in which vets deny feeling guilty , how can one tell how much of that is true , and how much they may be hiding from themselves ? The past , after all , has not held still ; it has pursued us these last several years even as we have tried to leave it behind . Almost every bit of information we have had about the war since its end has called its legitimacy into question and revealed the cupidity of those who oversaw it . Devastating as this information ought to have been to all Americans , it has certainly disturbed many of our vets even more ; and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to discover retrospectively the truths of the war find themselves in the predicament of Oedipus ; every step they take toward the truth brings them closer to their own guilt . The real issue , for each of the veterans , is not whether it was a just war , or if he belonged there in the first place ; it is , rather , the way the war was fought : the wholesale slaughter of innocents , the devastation of the countryside , and the extent and nature of our atrocities ? which have never been and may never be fully known . THINK , AS I WRITE , of several conversations I have had with vets in recent months . There is no way , really , in a few words , to describe the range of feelings and reactions that come into play in their voices and faces as they speak . Often what passes across their faces is at odds with the words ; one feels as if one is listening to two voices at once , or as if they desperately want to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall , in particular , the way vets describe their reception in America after the war . They were shocked , they explain , to find themselves treated by their countrymen as if they were at fault . This was especially true on college campuses , where they were spat upon , ostracized , and called baby-killers or murderers . Something more than injury or confusion creeps into their voices : something plaintive , yearning . The words baby-killer and murderer become in their mouths a kind of self-accusation , as if the savagery they ascribe to their critics is a part of their own inner life for which they seek absolution . At such times one finds oneself wanting to reach out to smooth away their pain . But how is one to do that ? Many vets , actually , find themselves more guilty than they appear to other members of society ; they judge themselves more harshly than they are judged by others . Yet their feelings about themselves , as painful as they are , may well be morally accurate . The guilt they feel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many killed out of ignorance ; but though others may forgive them , many men , as they grow older and learn moreabout the past , can not forgive themselves . Here one hesitates , of course . There are areas in which no man can adequately judge another ; even though some sort of general guilt exists , who can say of any particular man , this is how much he must feel or suffer ? Every vet had his own situation , his own war . Some , of course , killed gladly , arbitrarily . But others killed reluctantly , or in a hallucinatory fog , distanced from their actions by music or drugs . Still others killed against their will , lacking the courage or foolishness to resist ; and others killed because they had been trained to do it , or for the reasons at work in almost any of us : because they were there , or were told to kill , or because others were trying to kill them . There are so many different stories , so many different motives , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations , provisos , disclaimers . Three such forms of extenuation come to mind , which ought to enter into every judgment ? about ourselves or others ? that we make about guilt . First , there is the complexity of guilt , the difficulty in separating out individual responsibility in the midst of war from the more general responsibility of a people or a nation . " Shee-it , " a vet said to me once , " I come from Dallas , man . What in hell did I know back then ? Even in ' 68 , everyone I knew was for the war : teachers , parents , clergymen even . Dissenters ? They were just dirty northern hippies to us . I was just doin ' right . " Behind the shared guilt for the war lies a deeper and more general guilt , one that includes all the other forms of obvious or incipient violence at home or abroad that prepare the way for war . Daily , even in supposed " peace , " we are complicitous in distant places with brutality and murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing goes on here at home in those quarters of our cities we carefully avoid . If our boys in Vietnam were not trained to kill throughout their lives , they were at least readied for it through the mix of national pride , obedience , superiority , and racism we teach in our schools and encourage in our communities . In a way , few of the men who fought in Vietnam were ever really there , ever really saw the place and their enemies . They were locked , still , in our classrooms , in our national dreams , in our old Hollywood films , living out , almost like robots , the pervasive national myths of virtue , prowess , and power . Second , there is the nature of the war itself . It was , after all , a civil war , a guerrilla war . Though Coppola is partly right in seeing it in terms of advanced technology pitted against native innocence and faith , down on the ground , in hand-to-hand combat , our young troops were often out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also by an entire civilian population that saw them as intruders , invaders ? a situation for which nothing had prepared them . For many of our troops the war was like a perpetual Halloween Night grown brutally real . A sense of trespass and illegitimacy shrouded every moment ; they were like grown children in the wrong place , always in someone else 's garden , ready to fire or flee in an instant . Even innocuous objects took on a malevolent life of their own . Viet Cong tripwires made each twig and stone a threat . Our soldiers carried bits of wire to fit over the mouths of soft-drink bottles to protect themselves from the glass shards planted by the Viet Cong ; they held the bottles up to the light to make sure they were not half-filled with gasoline . Vets have told me about whores in Saigon who lined their vaginas with razor blades to mutilate GIs . And I remember a vet who said to me ( not without awe ) : " It was the Viet Cong women scared me the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would use the chance to escape . But the women ! They 'd come out to where you were and cut off your head or your balls . " Are such stories true ? It almost does not matter . What does matter is that Americans believed them and that they reveal to us a bit of the nightmare landscape Vietnam became for our vets . " It was like the goddamn West , " a vet once said to me . " I was more frightened of other Americans than of the Viet Cong . Guns everywhere , everyone armed . I got so used to it I carried a piece for months back in America , and I was ready to use it ? not on the enemy but on Americans . " At times supplies were so short that vets traded the scavenged parts of enemy bodies in the Saigon markets for the very same supplies intended for them in the first place : weapons , boots , or rain gear . Others became so disgusted with the perpetual theft of their food that they wrote to American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent directly to them . " I was from the city streets . " a young man said to me , " and so I was used to it all ? the graft , the theft , the crooked authority . I knew all about American corruption . But the farm kids ! Christ , when they saw all that , it damn near blew them away . It was worse than combat , to see their own country 's shabbiness . " No doubt this was intensified by the effects upon our troops of what they saw in the midst of their own army : the stupidity and dishonesty of their leaders and the cupidity and corruption pandemic behind the lines . Every vet I know has stories to tell about vanishing supplies , open theft , drug trafficking , black-marketeering , and gangsterlike confrontations that extended into Vietnam the normal life of American city streets . ND THERE IS , Finally , human nature itself , the apparent need and even the right of men to forget after a war what they have done or seen in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing for individual men , a kind of soothing boon that allows them to recover from the past . There are certain acts so terrible that only their victims can afford to remember them ; those who have committed them must forget , if only to stay sane . I remember reading about a German ex-officer discovered years after the end of the second world war hundreds of miles deep in the African bush in a house on stilts at a river 's edge , where he lived with his native wife and five children . When his captors asked him whether he was the man they were seeking , he said : " I am another . " And perhaps he was . Nature has its own forms of absolution , and they have little to do with justice . Memory 's power is countered by another power , perhaps as strong : the capacity to sunder the present from the past . One thinks of Lt. William Calley under house arrest , so typically American : baby-faced , soft-toned , with his southern-belle sweetie beside him , his evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His banality was equal in its small way to Adolf Eichmann 's : no sorrow , no shame , not even the visible signs of memory or a sense of what it might be that was so disturbing to those condemning him . Horrible , one thinks at first . But is it ? If it is horrible , it is also fully human , almost universal ? and understandable . We have already seen the effects of the past on those of our veterans who can neither forget nor stand its memory . For every man who succeeds in making something of the past , several ? who knows how many ? ? come to grief . Without the community of loving others about whom Jaspers spoke , those others whose burdens ease one 's own , forgetfulness may be nature 's kindest gift , and something that all men must be allowed , for perhaps nothing else will heal their wounds . ti A collective confession ND YET DESPITE the universality of guilt and the extenuations of war , it seems just that the war belongs to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean of its statistics , or of the analysis of its causes or the particulars of blame ; these will be pursued by others , scholars who come later , dissecting the war , laying out its details at a safe distance . But the nature of the war , and the fact and feel of it ? the conflicts and private struggles of conscience , the horrors that exist simultaneously outside and inside a man ? all of these belong to the vets , for who else has it in their power to keep us straight , and who else has the knowledge required to do it ? I remember , a few years ago in Michigan , accompanying a woman to a graduate seminar in psychology given by a friend of hers . The students were supposed to be discussing conscience and ethics , but they were not up to it . They were young , inexperienced , over-schooled . All value , they kept insisting , was relative , arbitrary ; truth was what anyone believed it was ; who were we , asked one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews ? It must have seemed right at the time . Only one man among them was different . Black , older than the rest , he had been in Vietnam . Reluctantly , only because I asked , he described his experiences there : how he had awakened one morning , after months of combat , weeping and shivering , unable to continue , frightened and ashamed of the killing he had done , full of self-hatred . Those in the room fell silent suddenly ; reality had intruded upon them . But they were not up to it ; they had to evade it . " Just shell shock , " the army doctors had told the vet , and now the students had a similar explanation . " Conditioning , " they said ? that was all . First taught not to kill , then asked to kill , he had been caught between two arbitrary orders . I still remember the look on the vet 's face . He smiled at me and shook his head , as if to say : You see it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I respond ? That what he had said needed saying , whether they heard it or not ? That it was precisely because the others did not understand that it needed saying ? Thathe must keep faith with the dead even if the living kept no faith with him ? The vets must speak ? both for our good and their own . They know firsthand ? as most of us should but do not ? that guilt is real , and that men can not be fully human or whole without coming to terms with their relation to suffering others . Will the vets speak ? Some of them , I suppose , have no choice . They are unable either to forget the past or come to terms with it without speaking . Every war , whatever its nature , is followed by a sort of lag time , a period of assimilation and silence during which , as most men forget the past , a few mine from the past what they later speak into the world . Both of the films I have mentioned here ? Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade and a half after the end of the first world war . And it has taken European film makers nearly forty years to confront the complex moral issues of the holocaust . Perhaps something similar will happen with Vietnam . Our great texts , and a period of rich understanding , may yet be ahead of us ; new books ? still working in the minds of silent men ? and new films may , a decade from now , confront us with the truth of the past in a way we have not yet learned to manage . The problem with that , of course , is that it may come too late to do much good . Even our young seem , at the moment , affected by our appetite for war . A few days ago a veteran I know who teaches a high-school class told me about an experiment he conducted : " I like to set up mock elections in historical contexts , " he said . " Last week I chose the later stages of the Vietnam war , just about the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dove who promised to end the war . The other was a hawk who wanted not only to mine the harbor but also to use nuclear weapons . " " And who won ? " I asked . " The hawk , " he said , " in a landslide . " I have little doubt we will come fully round , as nations usually do , to where we were before , perhaps a bit wiser , but not much , and subject continuously each one of us and each of our children to the pressures , influences , and conditioning that lead men everywhere to war . We are not much worse in America than people anywhere , but we are not much better either , and our shared national moral life ( and therefore the destinies of countless others affected by our choices ) hangs perpetually in a kind of uneasy balance , slanted toward violence but checked by decency . All that protects us from the worst aspects of our nature is simply a humility grounded in the consciousness of our past fallibility and the mem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not arguing here for a pure pacifism ? though given the human capacity for error there is an argument to be made on that count . What I am arguing for here is simply the minimal moral ground for any just society : the willingness of all men and women to accept absolute responsibility for the nature of their acts and their consequences , especially in those matters involving others and life and death . It is individual judgment , choice , and responsibility that leaven and define the nature of shared moral life . Nations and national leaders must be constrained and circumscribed by ethical standards passionately maintained by every private citizen : the capacity to see others clearly , to understand the relationship of one 's life to theirs , and to judge the demands of the state and resist its power and propaganda in accordance with one 's best and private sense of justice . It has fallen to the vets to remind us of this , and what we owe them in return is everything we can do to make that task easier . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our own culpability , but also a willingness to begin the reexamination and re-creation of the debauched moral landscape in which their struggles occur . As it now stands , those veterans who take guilt seriously are set apart from others , isolated by their seriousness . But it is , ironically , their guilt that joins them to others , thrusts them violently into the human world . They must understand not only that they may be guilty but that they are guilty too , in the same way that other men are guilty ? not necessarily in a special way but simply in a more obvious way . Their guilt derived from the war is not so different , really , from the guilt of the man who has two coats while another has none , or the guilt of the overfed in a hungry world , or the guilt of those who remain oblivious and protected by privilege in a world of impermissible pain . Only when all of us take seriously the possibility of our own culpability will the vets understand that their guilt , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rather than monstrous . Yet , having said all that , I must add that it is not likely to occur . For the most part the vets will be left to confront their guilt on their own . The only other Americans to confront their own guilt may well be those who stumble accidentally ? and almost unwillingly ? into its acknowledgment . I am thinking , as I write , of something that happened later that night in Michigan . After the seminar my friend and I sat in the kitchen with the wife of her professor-friend , as she told us what he had neglected to explain himself ? that he had become a member of a Charismatic Catholic sect , now spoke in tongues , and was convinced that all human evil could be traced to possession by the devil , and had little to do with choice . Later , we went down the street to a neighborhood bar . it was the night of the first Ford-Carter election debate , the one in which the equipment failed . As we sat at our tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two figures voiceless at their lecterns , a young man came over and talked to us . He was a veteran ? hair in a ponytail , wearing an army jacket , carrying a guitar case . He set it down and introduced himself and launched into a soliloquy the kind one sometimes hears from disturbed veterans : brilliant , schizzy , disjointed , heartbreaking , shifting from his childhood to the war to America to God to Carter to Ford to his parents to the army doctors to the powers who ran the country to the CIA 's plot to cheat him of sleep and drive him insane . He proceeded lucidly for a while , and then suddenly his language came apart . Flashes of madness appeared ; one could hear , behind the words , bomb blasts and rifle fire and the dead falling around him . And when he had finished he put one hand on my friend 's arm and one on mine . " I do n't know you , " he said , " but you 're all right . I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . " Outside on the street , my friend , remembering the seminar and the professor 's wife and the vet , put her head on my shoulder and wept . " I did not think , " she said , " that it had come to this . " Yet it had come to " this , " though my friend , like the rest of us , had trouble grasping the pain and death incumbent upon us , or the cost to others of our careless posturing , arrogance , and rage . Weeping , I know , solves nothing ; morality is an activity , not a sentiment ; and yet there was something in my friend 's weeping , as there was in the black veteran 's tears in the midst of war , that seems to me to hold the key to the re-creation of ethical life . It was as if , in relief , she had set free the stirring of memory , the raw beginning of speech : the angers and sympathies and griefs and regrets that form the human center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her weeping meant . And if it did , God grant her , as well as the rest of us , the courage and tenacity to see through to its end the ethical journey such weeping begins .
