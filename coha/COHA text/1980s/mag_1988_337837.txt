In Texas , troubled banks are becoming almost as common as tumbleweed . Last week Dallas-based First RepublicBank , the state 's largest bank holding company ( assets : $33.2 billion ) , skidded to the brink of failure and was forced to go , ten-gallon hat in hand , to the U.S. Government . Within two days the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation advanced $1 billion to keep First RepublicBank 's 73-member banks in business . At the same time , Houston 's ailing First City Bancorp , the fourth largest banking company in the state , reported that its plan for returning to financial health was in jeopardy . The problems encountered by both companies dramatized once again just how badly the Texas oil and real estate busts have damaged the state 's economy and financial system . <P> The travails at First RepublicBank began last year , when the company , then called RepublicBank , acquired another Dallas firm , InterFirst , which was on the verge of collapse . InterFirst seemed salvageable , but its loan portfolio was in worse shape than RepublicBank assumed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . Says Paul Horvitz , a professor at the University of Houston : " The merger may turn out to have been the worst business decision ever made . " Worried First RepublicBank 's depositors have pulled some $2 billion out of their accounts this year . If First Republic were to fail , it could cost the FDIC $5 billion to restore the bank 's financial health . That would make the rescue more expensive than the $4.5 billion bailout of Continental Illinois in 1984 . <P> Federal officials are still trying to work out a successful rescue package for First City . Under a plan announced last September , the FDIC said it would pump $970 million into First City , but only if holders of the bank 's bonds agreed to sell their securities for up to 45 cents for every $1 of face value . Noteholders were supposed to exchange 90% of the bonds for cash by March 8 . But many of them are demanding a better deal , and when a one-week extension passed last week , only 51% of the securities had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to March 29 . Frank Anderson , an independent banking analyst , likens the maneuvering between First City and its bondholders to " a high-stakes poker game in which neither side is willing to give in . " <P> The only major Texas bank that has not yet shown up at the bailout window is the state 's second largest financial institution , Dallas-based M Corp . It lost $258 million last year and , like its competitors , has a host of bad real estate and energy loans . But the bank 's executives are convinced that they can solve their problems without turning to Uncle Sam for help .
