One is the character she plays : a loose-living Texan named Juanelle , who couldn ' t be more different from Eleanor Roosevelt or the other respectable types Alexander has played in pictures like ' ' Testament ' ' and ' ' All the President ' s Men. ' ' // The other surprise is her credit as executive producer of the film - marking a major step forward in her career as a developer of new projects for movies and TV. // ' ' Square Dance ' ' is the story of a teen-age girl ( Winona Ryder ) who lives with her fussy grandfather ( Jason Robards ) on a Texas farm . Itching to spread her wings a bit - and curious about her mother , Juanelle , who left her to Grandpa ' s care years ago - she abruptly goes to the big city and moves in with her long-lost parent. // // She soon learns a few hard lessons about life , partly from a mentally backward young man ( Rob Lowe ) who becomes her best friend . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times . But director Daniel Petrie and screenwriter Alan Hines treat their material with clear sincerity , and the performances are all solid . When she visited New York recently to launch the picture , I asked Miss Alexander what attracted her to the story. // ' ' I was very touched by this little girl ' s odyssey , ' ' she replied , ' ' and by her desire to find out who she was . She thought she ' d find some answers when she spent time with her mother . But what she finds is a woman who has very little maternal instinct and is quite narcissistic and egocentric ! ' ' // As an executive producer , Alexander felt this situation would make for strong drama . As an actress , she was fascinated by the idea of playing a character like Juanelle. // ' ' I get offered a lot of films that have a noble woman pursuing a noble cause , or something like that , ' ' she acknowledges . ( A review of her latest TV vehicle appears on the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , usually . But after a while , to get offered something like Juanelle - wild , self-centered , not sympathetic - was a lot of fun. ' ' // Alexander made thorough preparations for the task. // ' ' I bought different makeup , dyed my hair red , put on false nails , and went to the honkytonks in Texas every other night ! ' ' she reports . ' ' And it didn ' t take but one night before I met a lot of Juanelles. ' ' // Alexander enjoyed her evenings in these music joints and learned from them . ' ' I know women and men who go six or seven nights a week , ' ' she says . ' ' It ' s not to pick up people , it ' s to dance ! And it ' s for the companionship of other people who love to dance. . . // ' ' I love to dance , ' ' she continues . ' ' I frequented discos and stuff like that in my youth - what they call ballroom dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the country-and-western dances , which I love , but the fact that a woman can go into these places by herself and nobody gives two hoots about it . She ' s just like any guy walking in . And she can ask guys to dance ! You don ' t even talk half the time , on the dance floor . Then the dance is over , and that ' s it . It ' s like the old days , probably in our grandparents ' times . . . ' ' // Alexander always does research before playing a part , although her methods are more ' ' haphazard ' ' than ' ' methodical , ' ' she says. // ' ' I love research , ' ' she asserts . ' ' Probably my favorite reading is biographies . I love to look at pictures , if it ' s a famous person - and their letters , home movies , whatever . For a character like Juanelle , who ' s fictional , I just go to the haunts that she ' d go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The aim of this research is authenticity . ' ' I think authenticity is extremely important for storytelling , ' ' says the star . ' ' I ' m not suggesting all storytelling , because fantasy has to be part of it , too . But for actors , I think it helps enormously to have some core of authenticity - not only of behavior , but of emotion , as well. ' ' // Which is more important in acting : the externals - gestures , expressions , clothing , and so forth - or what the performer feels inside ? // ' ' Boy , that ' s a tough one , ' ' Alexander answers . ' ' But I ' ve always felt that if I ' m feeling something very , very strongly - particularly on film , in closeup - you pick up an awful lot right through the eyes . It ' s a weird thing . But you can look at people , even if you don ' t know them very well , and you can tell if they ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ' s amazing just what human expressions will read if you ' re feeling something inside. ' ' // Along with acting , Alexander has been active in production work for about seven years . ' ' Square Dance ' ' is her first feature film in that capacity . ' ' I ' ve got about seven things in development , ' ' she reports , ' ' in features and television and sitcoms. ' ' // What sort of script is she likely to commission or produce ? ' ' Stories that have to do with relationships , like ' Square Dance , ' or stories that have to do with some social or political issue that I find interesting or attractive to explore . ' ' But her criteria aren ' t rigid . ' ' One ( current project ) is a big adventure film ! ' ' she says with a smile. // Alexander has been involved with the Amnesty International organization and with nuclear disarmament issues in her off-screen life , and she acknowledges that it would be ' ' a natural outgrowth ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her projects. // Alexander is excited about the prospect of making high-quality independent films that couldn ' t - or wouldn ' t - be done in the hotly competitive atmosphere of Hollywood or network TV . She feels the time is right for a flowering of independent production. // ' ' If you look at what ' s happened with the marketing of studio pictures in the past two to three years , ' ' she says , ' ' you see they really can ' t support smaller stories . . . Because of their overhead , which is significant , they need to do blockbuster films - action , adventure , sci-fi , comedies - with major stars , for the most part. // ' ' So the rise of independents is not an accident . This year the number of independent films surpassed that of studio pictures . They certainly didn ' t surpass studio pictures at the box office - studios still rake in more than 85 percent . But something new is happening in the film market. ' ' // None of this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burner . She ' s still busy in front of movie and TV cameras , and she tries to keep some contact with the stage . But the stage aspect of her career has been hard to maintain because of a slowdown in meaningful opportunities. // Theater is at a critical juncture , Alexander thinks. // ' ' Theater itself is never going to die , ' ' she says , ' ' because you ' re never going to kill that one-to-one dimension . It only takes two people to do that : one to perform and one to watch . And there ' s plenty of street theater going on , and the rise in community theater across the country has been extraordinary. . . // ' ' But the professional theaters are very , very sick dogs because it takes so much ( money ) to maintain them at this time . That ' s going to be a never-ending spiral downward , I ' m afraid . The stories are being told in . . . other media , so I ' m not worried about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some kind of verbal skills that the playwrights gave to us .
