 | Democrats , shakily united behind their ground-breaking ticket of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro , are rallying for a fall campaign in which many acknowledge only faint hopes of upsetting Ronald Reagan . Led by Mondale 's chief rivals , Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson , party leaders voice enthusiastic determination to come from behind with the first national ticket offering a woman for Vice President . Yet the private mood of many Democrats leaving their national convention was heavily laced with gloom by weaknesses exposed in what they had hoped would be a flag-waving campaign kickoff . Many talked openly of prospective candidates for 1988 , as if this year were already a lost cause . Behind the dark outlook : Blunders by the Mondale organization and aggravated old enmities among major factions that the Democrats must weld together to regain the Presidency . Mondaie tried to put spark in his troops for the uphill battle by accepting the nomination in an aggressive speech designed to attack Reagan head-on while refuting his own reputation as a dull campaigner . Fighting words . " I heard you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the party got the voters ' message when the Democrats were ousted from power in 1980 ? and had changed . " We are a mirror of America . . . . Over the next 100 days , in every word we say , in every life we touch , we will be fighting for the future of America . " He later renewed his challenge to Reagan to meet in six debates . Ferraro , 48 , who is likely to get at least as much attention during the campaign as Mondale , set a combative tone for the struggle in declaring : " Americans everywhere want to live by the same set of rules . But under this administration , the rules are rigged against too many of our people . " Despite all the bold rhetoric , the party faces a tough job in healing feelings bruised by a rough battle for the presidential nomination and an often chaotic convention . Hart , although pledging to " devote every waking hour and every ounce of energy " to beating Reagan , left Mondale 's lieutenants seething over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his rival . The Colorado senator urged delegates not to " hand out this nomination like a gold watch for being a good , loyal Democrat . " And he clearly was labeling Mondale an old-style politician  | when he declared : " Promises are cheap , rhetoric is hollow and nostalgia is not a program . " Tenacious try . Hart , though trailing badly , fought for delegates right up to the roll call . Mondale supporters accused him of stretching out his appearance at the podium so long that it was after 10 p.m . Pacific Coast time , when much of the nation was asleep , before a delayed vote by the New Jersey delegation put Mondale over the top . Party strategists now are wondering how much of an effort Hart , who left no doubt he intends to run for President again in 1988 , will make to deliver his constituency of independentminded , young urban professionals . Jackson , who said the party " must now speak with one voice , " brought tears to the eyes of white and black delegates alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologized for his campaign excesses . Said the civil-rights activist , whose unexpectedly strong campaign antagonized many Jews and others while energizing black voters across the nation : " If in my low moments , in word , deed or attitude , through some error of temper , taste or tone , I have caused anyone discomfort , created pain or revived someone 's fears , that was not my truest self . " Jackson , however , made fresh demands on Mondale by calling for more  | black representation on the party 's national committee and in the Mondale campaign , more top federal posts if Mondale wins and more money to help elect blacks to Congress from districts in the South . Like Hart , Jackson hinted at another run for the White House . That , plus complaints by his supporters that they were disenchanted with Mondale and their treatment at the convention , raised the danger of a lack of zeal among blacks in the fall campaign . One black delegate from Philadelphia ? a Jackson supporter ? explained that he could not back the party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That kind of negative talk is a bad omen for Mondale , who will need overwhelming support from blacks if he is to overcome Reagan 's lead of 15 percentage points in the latest Gallup Poll . Without a heavy turnout of blacks ? some 19 million of whom are eligible to vote ? Mondale can not hope to carry several Southern states that are essential to his long-shot strategy . One more worry . The nation 's Hispanics , another crucial group with a potential voting strength of 9 million , are also a worry . Their acclaim for the ticket was far from thunderous . Arnold Torres , a Hispanic lobbyist in Washington , said that Mondale has " a brown gap . " The chief complaint of Hispanics is that Mondale has not pressured Democrats in Congress who support an immigration-reform bill that Hispanics consider discriminatory . Even organized labor , whose leaders broke precedent by endorsing Mondale before the primaries even began , may have trouble delivering its votes . Hart exposed that weakness by winning a large share of union members ' primary ballots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , Mondale will be going up against a Republican President who four years ago defied tradition by taking nearly half the blue-collar vote . Almost 50 percent of the nation 's union members are not even registered to vote . To correct that problem , the AFL-CIO is spending 1.5 million dollars on a registration drive this summer . Union views . Some labor leaders are displeased at the makeup of the Mondale campaign team , particularly with the new and controversial role of Bert Lance of Georgia as general chairman . Lance was rated an enemy of labor in the Jimmy Carter administration , and one union official complained of the appointment : " It was an insult to people who have gone the last mile for Mondale . " Such weak points in Mondale 's ranks will force the Democrats to lean even more heavily than usual on older citizens , the 28 million voters who comprise what Representative Claude Pep- per of Florida calls " the sleeping giant of American politics . " Issues to be raised against Reagan : Potential cuts in Social Security and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Democrats intend to make maximum use of what they call the " Ferraro factor " in appealing to women , who make up more than half of the electorate . Many expect Ferraro 's spirited personality and no-nonsense approach to compensate for what they perceive as Mondale 's lack of charisma . " I 'm not a softie , " she declares . " I 'm not going to let anyone run over me . " Using Ferraro as their main draw , the r ' Democratic National Committee hopes to add 3 million women to the voter rolls in a separate registration drive . With Mondale getting credit for making the historic move of naming a woman to run with him , a top official boasted that there will be " a new army of volunteers in the trenches against Reagan to remind women about the gender gap . " Representative William Ratchford of Connecticut said : " Ferraro will be helpful in our area , where there is a big Italian vote . " Representative Frank Guarini of New Jersey added that his campaign would be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferraro dealt directly with fears that she might not be an effective campaigner in the South by telling a meet- ing of Southern governors and party leaders : " If you want me to come into your states , I will . If you do n't think I can help in your states , I wo n't . " Several of the Southern officials denied that the congresswoman from New York would be unwelcome . One Mississippi delegate pinned a note to the hotel-room door of a Mondale campaign official , asking Ferraro to make a speech in his state . Some other Democrats , while declaring their personal support for Mondale and Ferraro , are wary of identifying too closely with them . Representative Sam Stratton of New York said he will " concentrate on my own district . " Representative Butler Derrick of South Carolina noted : " I 'll be running my own campaign ? that 's nothing new with me . " Publicly , the Democratic line is that even if Reagan wins re-election , he will have no coattails that pull in other Republican candidates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic incumbents out of Congress and state offices as it did in the 1980 victory over Jimmy Carter . Iffy issues . Apprehensions of party leaders were accented by questions of Mondale 's leadership and judgment that arose over the way he and his staff mishandled an internal party matter before the convention opened . Mondale privately informed party Chairman Charles Manatt of California that he would be replaced at the end of the convention by Lance , who had resigned as budget chief under Carter amid an investigation into his banking practices in Georgia . Word of the switch quickly leaked out , and there were howls of protest from supporters of Manatt and critics of Lance . Not only were labor leaders incensed , but many Jews objected on the ground that Lance has too many close business ties with Arabs . Within 48 hours , Mondale flipflopped by announcing that Manatt would remain in office and that Lance would assume a new title of general campaign chairman . A typical reaction came from Representative Robert Matsui of California : " Is Mondale indecisive ? Ca n't he say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and Fritz blinked . " Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina complained that Lance " left Washington under a cloud and is now back on the front pages . "  | The Democrats hit both high and low points on the convention floor during sessions that drew a disappointingly small television audience . The proceedings were so dull at one point that one network turned away from the convention to rerun an old drama . One of the highlights was a stemwinding keynote speech by New York 's Governor Mario Cuomo that brought delegates to their feet cheering . Attacking the President for leading a government based on survival of the fittest , he previewed the " fairness " theme that the Democrats will stress in the campaign . Cuomo 's charge . Mocking Reagan 's frequent reference to the U.S. as " a shining city on a hill , " Cuomo thundered : " The President is right . But the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city 's splendor . A shining city is perhaps all the President sees from the portico of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone seems to be doing well . " Another success was Mondale 's ability to work out compromises that averted a disruptive fight over the party 's platform . Although they did not please everyone , members of the Mondale camp conceded to Hart on a peace plank concerning use of U.S. military forces in world trouble spots and yielded to Jackson on the subject of affirmative action . Still , a warning signal of troubles ahead was sounded by the angry reaction of black delegates to defeat of another Jackson platform amendment that called for the abolition of runoff primary elections in the South . Feelings grew so heated that many blacks not only booed Andrew Young , black mayor of Atlanta , for defending Mondale but also jeered Coretta King , widow of assassinated civil-rights leader Martin Luther King , when she stood up for Young . As they left San Francisco , Democratic delegates tried to buck up each other with talk of being positive and " not hanging out the black crepe paper yet . " Even the most optimistic among them , however , conceded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for them to regain the White House .
