But after several weeks of a beginning photography course , where I learned to spelunk my way through the darkroom , my mercenary impulse changed . I couldn ' t set the change to words at the time , but what I was feeling was the power of the camera to simultaneously release and capture the eye. // // I actually started to make a little money from my pictures . Most of the photos I had to take for my articles were standard shots of the staff and the president and the office manager , with an occasional skewed-slant picture of the company sign . But they were good pictures to teethe on . They made me pay attention to simple but important details of composition like forehead shine and that strange intruding object on the periphery I hadn ' t noticed before. // But on another level it didn ' t matter that I made some money from pictures because I ' d found something more important . I started going out on ' ' shoots ' ' for myself , spending a day in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with children swirling around the lens . My frame of vision , my ability to frame a vision , changed , as it does with any photographer , from seeing with the eye to seeing with the camera . The world around me became a broadcast of collectible elements ; life became a series of scenes , of ' ' opportunities . ' ' At first this bothered me because it seemed to split the world into nothing but discrete objects ready to be tidied into a picture by ' ' ME , ' ' the photography god. // Taking more and more pictures made me realize how arrogant and mistaken that attitude is . The world allows me to take pictures by giving me such a rich chaos to chose from . I don ' t arrange anything . Or , maybe better , I can arrange a posture or an angle , but I can not fully harness the dancers . What finally emerges in a picture depends as much upon good fortune and quantum vibrations as it does preparation. // But it would be inaccurate to imply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' ve learned so far is that like any other artist I have to prepare myself for it . I have to ready myself for the wholly unknowable serendipitous moment when the universe commands me to ' ' Snap it ! ' ' Learning tools of the trade , the mechanics of f-stop and aperture and composition , goes along with ( borrowing a notion from Emerson ) tutoring my whole being to become an eye that absorbs light and turns it into commentary . Each informs the other with power so that when the universe says ' ' Look , there ! ' ' , the camera and the photographer , working as one eye and one thought , turn the language of light into the language of witness. // Sometimes the witness can be simply colloquial , the kinds of pictures my local newspaper likes : children with dripping ice-cream cones at the beach , a duck in the middle of a lake at sunset - in short , the ordinary ' s frozen moment. // But the witness can be more charged , and it ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my desk are two pictures , one focusing on the individual , the other on the political , and though they are unrelated , they share a similar verve of testimony . The first is of five office workers in Atlanta hanging out a sixth-floor window waiting to be rescued from a fire. // The photograph is taken looking up from the ground , and on their faces is a mixture of bewilderment and hope , exasperation and fear . What make this photo effective is the rich presentness of the moment . While bustling news-at-eleven video footage might give us the ' ' scene , ' ' it ' s the stillness of the arrested image that invokes our humanity . Because we get to look at their faces for more than a glance , we can read in their stark gazes what might have been our own feelings , our own fright and tension , and find empathy. // The second photo is more brutal . It ' s a picture , taken by a Chinese photographer , of soldiers beating a student to death in Beijing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gun butts . Other soldiers to the right and left of the tableau look on or look away . Gruesome , and utterly horrifying. // But this one photograph gives the lie to the story Chinese authorities have been proffering to the world . This one photograph makes truth the property of everyone who sees it , truth communicated in a more piercing way than any wire report . This picture will save us from doubt and apathy , fire up our desire for justice. // A recent example of the way photography can make Eudora Welty ' s ' ' fleeting moment ' ' spark and crackle is an exhibit traveling the country . Titled ' ' Photographs of the Powerless/Photographs by the Powerless , ' ' former UPI photographer Jim Hubbard has shot a portfolio of the despair of America ' s homeless . Among the charged pictures is one which shows effectively how the camera can sharpen what the eye might otherwise overlook. // IN the photograph , a group of homeless people sit at the base of the sign outside the Department of Justice in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Department of Justice ' ' so that they float over the group like some ironic Pentecostal flame . No commentary is necessary to underscore the injustice being done in the picture . An observer on the street watching the scene might miss the irony , or want to get past it as soon as possible . But the tight focus and selected border of the photo make that impossible . Forced to take notice , the observer can no longer feign indifference. // But providing witness through the camera has its snares . Taking pictures means intruding , and this can tempt the photographer to believe that he or she is exempt from the situation being photographed . When I was covering a demonstration at the Seabrook nuclear plant in June , I felt invisible and invincible behind my camera as the crowd moved closer to the line of police at the gate . Recording the events had the paradoxical effect of making me feel that I wasn ' t really a part of them , that I was immune to principle or danger. // It wasn ' t until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusion dropped away . But I saw how easy it would be to snap a picture of suffering and believe that the suffering was none of my concern , to save the photo and not the person . I learned that it was important to use the camera in the service of getting people to see what they might not be able to see , and resist the temptation to feed my own hubris. // It has been wonderful to discover that new ways of seeing are still available , to feel that I am participating in light , doing something that ' s an antidote to gravity and a balance weight to time. // //
