It was the kind of ecological disaster that environmentalists had been warning about since oil first began flowing from Alaska 's North Slope twelve years ago . And eerily , it struck last week , on the very day that the 3,100 residents of Valdez had planned to commemorate the 25th anniversary of another disaster : the great Alaska earthquake of 1964 , which sent a towering tidal wave smashing into Valdez , killing 131 people . After taking on 1.2 million bbl. of crude at the Valdez terminal , the southern end of the 800-mile Trans- Alaska Pipeline , the 987-ft. tanker Exxon Valdez headed out through Prince William Sound . Maneuvering to avoid icebergs , the tanker rammed into an ; underwater shoal called Bligh Reef . The vessel 's side split open and thick North Slope crude spewed into one of the most pristine bodies of water in the U.S. <P> The threat to local marine life quickly became apparent . As oil gushed out at the rate of 20,000 gal . an hour , emergency teams found ducks coated with crude and sea lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wreck . By the time the leak had slowed to a dribble a day later , an estimated 270,000 bbl. of oil had escaped , producing a slick 8 miles long and 4 miles wide . It appeared to be the largest spill , if not the worst in terms of ecological damage , in U.S. history . <P> The mishap could not have happened at a worse time . Besides being rich in whales , otters , seals , porpoises , dolphins and many species of birds , the waters around Valdez also contain some of the best commercial fishing grounds in Alaska . The harvest that was to begin this week , when fish such as herring and pink salmon start their annual springtime runs , could be endangered . <P> How the Exxon Valdez ran aground is a mystery . The accident occurred in extremely calm waters , and the captain , Joe Hazlewood , had been plying the area for a dozen years . Frank Iarossi , president of Exxon Shipping Co. , said the tanker was a mile off course even though its navigational systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of environmental conservation , said the captain 's effort to steer the Exxon Valdez back into the narrow shipping lane was like " trying to park a Cadillac in a Volkswagen spot . " <P> Emergency crews placed booms in the sound to contain the spill , and the Coast Guard dropped chemicals in an attempt to break up the slick . But local officials criticized Exxon and pipeline officials for responding slowly . Doug Griffin , city manager of Valdez , said the first teams to arrive waited for a leader to show up and take charge . <P> Aside from the damage to marine life , the spill seemed certain to have an impact in another area . Environmentalists will use the accident as ammunition in their fight against further oil development in Alaska , particularly U.S. plans to permit drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
