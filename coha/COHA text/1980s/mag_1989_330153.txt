BLAZE <P> Directed and Written by Ron Shelton <P> It was an affair made in tabloid heaven : stripteaser Blaze Starr ( " Miss Spontaneous Combustion , and I do mean bustion ! " ) and Earl K. Long , fine Governor of the great state of Louisiana . Long was too full of his princely power to be discreet about his indiscretions . Blaze could have told him  --  and in this lengthy , clever , depressing film she does  --  that " your political instincts are clouded by the aroma of my perfume . " By 1959 , when Long 's campaign slogan was the forthright " I ai n't crazy , " his liaison with the stripper was as controversial as his tax evasion and support for Negro voting rights . He lost . It was a little American tragedy , played as farce . <P> Ron Shelton ( Bull Durham ) directs Blaze with plenty of pungent wit , but from a high , disinterested view . He never gets steam into the affair . Paul Newman approaches Earl from the outside too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Lear . Lolita Davidovich , making the most of her first big break , plays Blaze as a sensible , loving career gal with an overripe body . But the picture is not mainly about sex or even love ; it is about an aging man 's loss of sexual , political and personal power . <P> The film ends with a great shot . Blaze walks out of the state house where Earl 's corpse lies , and the camera ascends to take in Long 's old domain . Randy Newman 's poignant song Louisiana 1927  --  a cracker 's lament about a devastating flood  --  reaches its apogee of symphonic paranoia with the line " They 're tryin ' to wash us away . " Just then , the camera discovers the Mississippi roaring past , washing away Earl and his wily , wild , pre-TV tradition of Southern politics . What has happened down there is that the wind has changed , and for its last three minutes Blaze finds potent film poetry to express that change . The rest of the movie lacks Earl 's heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaze 's spontaneous combustion .
