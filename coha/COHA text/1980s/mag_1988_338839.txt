As a child , Josh had listened to Scripture and learned ; as an adult , Josh is allowed to read from the Torah so that he can pass on his family 's faith to a new generation . <P> At 14 , Josh is astute enough to understand that his bar mitzvah was more a ceremonial aspiration than a sudden transformation . Between childhood and adulthood lies the ridiculous and treacherous territory of adolescence . It is a region full of dangers , brainless impulses , hormonal furies .

Sandy Maisel , 42 , is a professor of government who recently finished one year of teaching at Harvard . Usually Sandy teaches at Colby College in Waterville , where Josh was raised . Sandy took over full-time custody of Josh and his older sister Dana , now 16 , after the divorce .
