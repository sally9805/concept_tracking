The U.S. dollar resumed its upward course yesterday , hitting new highs against the British pound , the French franc and the Canadian dollar . In late New York trading the pound stood at $1. 3010 and the Canadian dollar , at 75. 18 U.S. cents , while the dollar was at 8. 72 French francs . The dollar also reached a six-month high of 2. 8420 West German marks , just under last January ' s 10-year high of 2. 8450 marks , and it exceeded this year ' s previous highs against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc . In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday , the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 242. 50 yen from 242. 25 in New York yesterday afternoon . Traders attributed the dollar ' s strength to a slight uptick in U.S. interest rates , which supported the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments look even more attractive . Gold plunged $4. 30 an ounce to a two-year low of $343. 50 as a result of the dollars renewed strength . The dollar ' s strength is continuing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities prices , Ira Epstein , a commodity analyst , said yesterday . Barry M. Wainstein , a vice president of BankAmerica International , New York , said the dollar " moved like a yo-yo " yesterday , rising to a high of more than 2. 84 West German marks in the morning on news that a British tanker had been struck by unidentified missiles in the Persian Gulf , and then falling back to about 2. 81 marks when the Federal Reserve injected reserves into the U.S. banking system by purchasing securities from dealers , who agreed to buy them back tomorrow . Purchases by the Fed add reserves because dealers place the proceeds into their bank accounts . These repurchase agreements can put downward pressure on U.S. interest rates , although they didn ' t have that effect yesterday . Mr. Wainstein also said there had been " some heavy buying " of dollars on the International Monetary Market division of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange late in the day , which helped the dollar to rise again . " The underlying sentiment in the market , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. interest rates . As things stand , the dollar is within spitting distance of modern highs against most major currencies  --  where it hasn ' t already reached them . " While the Canadian dollar touched a new low yesterday , he said , its drop has for the time being been stopped by the fact that Canadian interest rates now are " comfortably above U.S. rates . " Peter Rogers , an assistant vice president and assistant chief foreign exchange dealer of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co . , New York , said the British pound is suffering from the nationwide dockers strike  --  which is halting British exports  --  and from " the general weakness of the oil market and other factors . " Britain is a major oil producer and any weakness in oil prices tends to depress sterling . Mr. Rogers said the market expects that British interest rates will be boosted again , perhaps as early as today , in a further attempt to halt the pound ' s decline . But the impact of such a move may already have been mitigated by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers said , " the worst for the pound is possibly over . The Bank of England is very concerned to maintain the pound at certain levels , including $1. 30 against the dollar and 3. 7 marks , and it will do what is necessary to see that there isn ' t further slippage . " Mr. Rogers said he sees the dollar " holding up firmly for the remainder of the week . " If the dollar goes into Friday in a position of strength , and U.S. economic indicators due that day  --  including the June producer price index , retail sales and industrial production  --  are good , he added , " the dollar will strengthen even further . " Gary Dorsch , a currency analyst for the Chicago commodity brokerage concern of Oppenheimer Rouse Futures Inc. , said a major reason for the dollar ' s strength is continued buying of U.S. securities by foreigners in the wake of congressional repeal of the 30% withholding tax on interest paid from such securities to foreigners . Mr. Dorsch said the repeal of the withholding tax provision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another would be the possibility of " total anonymity , " he said . " Europeans wouldn ' t have to identify themselves when they cash in their bonds , " he added , " and that means that the secrecy that once made Switzerland so attractive would now extend to the U.S. So I expect a lot of money would flow from Swiss francs into U.S. securities . " On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for delivery this month fell to $343. 50 an ounce from $347. 80 Monday . Contracts for all deliveries amounted to a brisk five million ounces . In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday , gold was quoted at $339. 75 an ounce . Don Tierney , a metals analyst with the Comex member firm of Stanley Bell &; Co. , said , " gold resumed its downtrend due to the resurgence of the strong dollar and a further liquidation of positions .
