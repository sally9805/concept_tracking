Robert Holmes a Court , Australia 's first billionaire and one of the world 's most fearsome corporate raiders , was renowned at home as the Great Acquirer . In the U.S. , his targets were the giants USX and Texaco . But when he arrived in his gold-toned Rolls-Royce for a meeting of his corporate shareholders last month in Perth , Holmes a Court , 50 , had acquired a new identity : the Great Disposer . <P> Holmes a Court was not at the meeting to announce yet another daring takeover but to concede the end of his boldest dream . In just eight minutes , the raider crisply laid out plans for his Bell Resources company to sell  --  at a $206 million loss  --  most of its 28% stake in Broken Hill Proprietary , Australia 's largest company ( 1987 revenues : $6 billion ) . Holmes a Court had patiently stalked BHP , a vast mineral and energy conglomerate , for nearly five years , aiming to use the company as the foundation for a global natural- resources empire . His decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last October 's stock-market crash , in which Holmes a Court 's empire was perhaps the world 's single largest loser . <P> A week earlier , complying with a directive from Australian stock exchanges for all companies to disclose the damages they suffered in the crash , Holmes a Court gave a stunning account of his companies ' net losses , now estimated at $1 billion . Holmes a Court described how his principal companies  --  Bell Group , Bell Resources and J.N. Taylor Holdings  --  suffered an avalanche of falling stock prices in their wide holdings in energy , banking , mining and retailing . As the Holmes a Court companies took losses on these investments , their own shares collapsed as well . The stock-market value of the Holmes a Court corporations plunged from $4.1 billion to $850 million . " We found ourselves , " he told Bell Group shareholders last December , " in the eye of the cyclone . " <P> His empire had a critical weakness : it was constructed largely of passive investments in other companies ' stock , rather than outright ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bell Group 's pre-October assets of $1.8 billion , for instance , were made up of corporate shareholdings . " We were overexposed to the world 's stock markets , " Holmes a Court has conceded . Moreover , since the raider did not own controlling interest in those corporations , he was unable to tap their corporate credit lines to get infusions of new money . Said he : " Our money was tied up without getting cash flow or profits . " <P> Reeling from Oct. 19 's plunge , Holmes a Court suffered a devastating blow four days later when Merrill Lynch canceled plans to raise $720 million for him by issuing low-interest securities . In the days before the crash , the Merrill Lynch debt issue seemed destined to give Holmes a Court the buying - power to finance his planned intercontinental behemoth . Even after the crash , the money might have helped him hang on to the investments he had already acquired . But without the financing , he was forced to meet obligations by selling off stocks at the worst possible moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
