George Bush ' s image has had more face-lifts than the Gabor sisters . He started the year in the role he finds most comfortable-not so much veep as VIP . He campaigned in a posh cocoon of Air Force II , limos , set speeches and minimum press availability . Then along came Iowa . Suddenly he was peering out from windbreakers and gim me caps , as miscast as Boy George in the cab of an 18-wheeler . By Super Tuesday , he was Media Man , dealing in photo ops . Then back to the sanctuary of the most ceremonial sinecure this side of Buckingham Palace . Lately , with polls showing a surprising edge to Michael Dukakis , Bush recreated himself as moralist-critic , lecturing on issues . All this was calibrated to the last tousled hair by the most expert attitude-engineers money can buy . What polls said people wanted was what the persona tailors gave them . Yet much of it was self-defeating . Bush now is widely regarded as wishy-washy , a perception difficult to change because it ' s accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your man . He has been for and against civil rights , the Vietnam war , Reaganomics and abortion , to name a few . He craves office not because of policies and beliefs but because , like Everest , it ' s there . Now he approaches a moment of truth or at least a freeze-frame that will fix for the duration the face he presents to the American people . Once he emerges from the convention , he will find it difficult to don a new wig or mustache . The pressures on him and his staff as they face this reality are enormous . Republican technicians have become masters of lighting , camera angles , mood music and when to let go the balloons . George Herbert Walker Bush offers them a stern challenge . He needs to give a speech that borders on a theatrical miracle . Dukakis , after skillfully lowering expectations , was hailed as Rocky V for neither stuttering nor stumbling . Bush will be judged by how he compares with Dukakis , not by how he stacks up against his less-than-dazzling self . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a Teleprompter to a throng of partisans is not exactly wrestling a bear . Bush should have a dull , successful convention , get a bump in the polls and leave New Orleans on close to even terms for a tight and probably extraordinarily ugly campaign . With two unexciting candidates , well financed and staffed , the election will be decided late and , quite likely , by the debates . Conventions are stage props ; TV debates , pits for mortal combat . How Bush fares in the debates should be fascinating . Despite his well- punched resume , or perhaps because of it , there seems to be something missing in the man . It ' s revealed in the pleasure he takes in the hollow grandeur of the vice presidency-and even more by his supplicant pursuit of that vocational vacuum . No one ever sought this constitutional afterthought so desperately . Bush begged Gerald Ford for it twice and turned cartwheels in public while Ronald Reagan toyed with naming Ford . He renounced many of his views to become Reagan ' s court cheerleader and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has always been contemptuous of him . His technicians keep saying he ' s about to become his own man , but the question is whether there ' s one left to become .
