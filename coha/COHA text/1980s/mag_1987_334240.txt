While corporations have forged all sorts of improbable unions , none in recent years have tried to merge a railroad with an airline . Norfolk Southern , an East Coast railroad-holding company , may venture such a match . The company disclosed that it is considering acquiring Piedmont , the profitable North Carolina-based airline . Since 1981 Norfolk has owned more than 19% of Piedmont stock . It agreed five years ago not to buy more than 20.5% of the airline 's shares , but that pact expired last week . <P> Industry observers were hard pressed to see the merit of such a merger . But in announcing its interest in Piedmont , the railroad may attract other bidders for the airline . Norfolk might then walk away with a handsome profit on its investment without ever having flown into the turbulent airline business .
