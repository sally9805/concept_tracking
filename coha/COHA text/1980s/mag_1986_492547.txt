Summertime , and the fishing is . . . easy ? Sing that line around a group of seasoned fishermen and they 're likely to change your tune . It 's not easy to hit a lake or a reservoir and land a stringer of " keepers . " It takes time , patience , and practice to enjoy consistently great fishing . The experts are the first to admit it . In our May/June issue , Jerry McKinnis , the host of the television outdoor program " The Fishin ' Hole , " tipped off our readers on winning trout tactics . In this issue , Babe Winkelman , Al Lindner , Billy Westmorland , and Steve McCadams pass along their angling expertise on catching walleyes , bass , and crappie . No , successful fishing is n't easy . But with some inside tips from these outdoor champions , the sport may at least become a little easier . Largemouth Bass Mention " bass " at a board meeting or a town social , and you 're likely to turn more heads than E.F . Hutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a sporting phenomenon . The Bass Angler 's Sportsmen Society ( B.A.S.S. ) has , by 1986 estimates , more than 1,600 different chapters . This figure does n't include the noncompetitive bassin ' that takes place all over the country . Why all the attention ? The largemouth bass , a highly pugnacious fighter that becomes a water warrior when hooked , delivers a " reel " challenge to the angler . And bass offer a delicious , flaky white fillet . Al Lindner , the host of the popular " In-Fisherman " TV specials , has logged some long hours zeroing in on largemouth tactics . " Fish are always found around food sources , " Al says . " When you 're fishing a bay , a cover , or an underwater point , try to pick a place that hosts a constant presence of food sources around it . You can learn to read these factors on your depth finders or graphs . " If it has signs of life on it , fish it , " Al emphasizes . " If it does n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to successful largemouth angling demands an awareness of the immediate environment . " Youmust develop the ability to understand water clarity , " Al explains . " Generally speaking , fish that live in clear-water lakes are spookier . They like smaller lures and lighter line . Largemouth in clear water will hit free-running baits , like a deep-dive lip crank , more often than fish in dark , dirty water conditions . " Water clarity also affects the ideal time of day to catch the feisty game fish . " Fish in clear-water lakes are prone to being more active early in late- to low-light hours : early morning , late evening , and on overcast orwindy days , " AI says . " Go to dark , dirty water and it all changes  --  a lot ! The fish are active generally in the middle of the day , and night fishing is poor . You can use heavier lines and much bigger lure . " The magic lure  --  a fisherman 's dream  --  will remain an illusion . " There 's no such thing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al confirms . " Your spinner baits are the closest thing to a universal largemouth-bass lure . It 'll catch largemouth bass all year long . " Al warns : " Nothing in fishing is 100 percent . The tips I 'm mentioning here might nudge the odds to about 70 percent in your favor . And with those kinds of odds , you know you 're fishing right . " But the element that separates the good fisherman from the rest has nothing to do with the environment or the fish : " Confidence makes things happen on a lake for you , " Al Lindner believes . " It 's the strongest lure in your tackle box . The unfortunate fact is that probably 95 percent of the fishermen do n't really understand it . Confidence is the missing link . It determines the difference between a good fisherman and a great fisherman . " Smailmouth Bass If you 're fishing to pick a fight , hook a smallmouth bass and you 've got a big one on your hands . This spunky relative of the largemouth packs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge , Billy Westmorland , the featured host of the popular outdoor fishing program " Billy WestmorTHE // " The fish will strike better when the water temperature is in the mid-50s to upper 60s , " Billy says . Location is also important . " Small-mouth normally will be in deeper water than their cousins , the largemouth , " Billy says . " They prefer rocky shorelines and rocky points where crawfish are present . " Choose any bait small in size , such as crayfish , small minnows , and small eels . If you 're using artificial tackle , pick lures that simulate crayfish , he says . Catching a smallmouth takes skill , but for many an angler like Billy Westmorland , the knockdown fight is just plain fun . Walleye Ask Babe Winkelman what his fa-71 vorite fish is and he 's likely to reply , " Whatever I have on the end of my line . " But the author , educator , and star of the television program " Good Fishin ' " has a special spot in his heart for walleyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I grew up in the upper Midwest , where the walleye has always reigned as the No. 1 game fish . " Elusive and unpredictable , walleyes were once found only in the triangular area extending across Canada and south to Alabama . But thanks to widespread stocking , they are now found in almost every state and province . What is it about walleyes that garners so much enthusiasm ? Fishing for them is not nearly so action packed as some other types of fishing . The walleye , not a spectacular fighter , does n't perform the acrobatics of a largeland 's Diary , " has earned a reputation as one of the country 's leading stringers of the species . " Smallmouth bass sure are one of the hardiest fighters , " the avid sportsman says . Although some states have better fishing than others , smallmouths are largely accessible throughout the United States . " The smallmouth bass can be found in northern Alabama and throughout the central U.S. , as far west as Missouri and north to Canada , " Billy says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catch goes , while other states produce larger-size fish . " The best smallmouth lakes are clear and deep , " he says . " When fishing for smallmouth , use small lines , small lures , and lightweight rods and reels . " For a fisherman , the best time to fish is all the time . Billy thinks the seasons do make a difference , though . " Springtime in the Kentucky , Tennessee , and Alabama regions , between April and May , is the ideal season , because the fish are spawning . In the northern states , the species spawns in May , June , and July . " He looks forward , however , to old man winter in Tennessee , his home state : " We can fish here in winter months because there is no ice on the lakes , " the angler says . " They 're not as crowded , and the water temperature stays in the 47-to69-degree range for several weeks , from November through January . 72 mouth bass or match the brute force of a fighting musky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating quality , " Babe quickly points out . " Anyone who 's ever enjoyed a shore lunch of fresh walleyes and tasted the delicious , flaky white meat knows the walleye takes a back seat to no fish as a taste delight . " For Babe , however , there 's more to it than taste . " Walleyes offer the ultimate challenge , " the author admits . " The walleye has a unique personality among fishes . He 's a cool , calculating critter who defies the angler to outwit him on his own terms . He ca n't be provoked  --  he must be outsmarted . He 's not a glutton  --  he 's a connoisseur . Seducing a walleye does n't require brawn. . . it takes patience and skill . " Although there 's no way to condense the copious amount of research in his books and lectures , Babe offers some invaluable guidelines : " At night the big female walleyes will feed on perch until the perch are finished spawning . When the perch dissipate and spread throughout the lake , the walleye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking for other forage to capitalize on . " // As Babe explains , the season dictates the movements of the walleye 's food source : " In late May and June , larvae attract minnows , and when the larvae start turning into flies , more minnows congregate . Consequently , big fish congregate there . But as summer rolls around , bait fish hatched in the spring have grown large enough to catch the walleye 's attention . So the fish spend more of their time in deeper water , where temperatures are cooler and light levels more to their liking . " Walleyes have extremely light-sensitive eyes . As a rule , Babe advises , the best walleye-fishing occurs during the early morning and late afternoon , and at night . Stacking the odds in your favor always includes doing a little homework . When fishing a strange lake , contact several people in the region . " First , see a conservation officer . Talk to the owner of a bait shop , " Babe coaches . " He talks to dozens of fishermen every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish . But play your cards right . If you had a lake that was producing some nice fish , would you send hundreds of tourists out to ruin the fishing ? Talk as intelligently as possible , letting him realize that you are conservation conscious . If he suspects you 're a skilled fisherman and care about nature , he might just take you under his wing . " Check out the weather conditions , he says . Cloudy or rainy weather usually spells good walleye fishing , July/August ' 86 but thunderstorms will send the walleye to hide in the weeds or to move into deeper waters . A good , long storm can keep the fish from biting for two to three days . Overlooking the schooling tendencies of walleyes can result in very serious fishing errors . " Walleyes are curious . When one walleye hits the bait , the others out of a school are likely to follow , hoping to pick up some scraps , " Babe says . Once you find the fish , the presentation is the key to angling success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , " he emphasizes . " The keys to successful fishing are first , being versatile enough to experiment with different families of baits , and second , to have confidence that what you 're fishing will produce . One without the other is worthless . " How to know which lure is catching the fish ? " The best way I know to build confidence is from hands-on fishing  --  and catching  --  experience , " Babe relates . " Maybe you 're pretty accomplished with a Lindy rig , but have n't experienced much success with a jig . The next time you get into a good bit , cut off that rig , and try a jig . After catching a few fish , you 'll learn what it feels like when a walleye picks up a jig . You 'll discover when and how to set the hook . " My credo has always been , ' Ask the fish what they want on a particular day . ' If the fish are not responding to the bait , try something else . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill  --  these are the keys to tackling the walleye . " There 's an awful lot to fishing , in general , " Babe concludes . " It 's simple and yet complicated . It 's an absolute science and a learned science . It 's not something you 're born good at ; it 's something that you can learn to be good at . Anyone can . That 's the one thing that 's great about the sport of fishing . " Hey , besides that , " Babe says with a smile , " you can have an absolute blast at it , no matter what the fish are doing . " Crappie If you bump into Steve McCadams , you 're probably on Tennessee 's Kentucky Lake . Steve spends at least 240 days a year fishing for his piscatory partners . The rest of the year he continued on page 96 96 win , you 've got to strike out ten batters and almost pitch a shutout . " Then again , considering Gooden 's accomplishments to date , it 's difficult not to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season began , he had struck out ten or more batters in 26 of his 66 major-league starts . Eleven times he held the opposition scoreless for an entire game . Only once last season , and nine times overall , did he give up more than three earned runs in a single game . He averages more than one strike-out per inning . During his career , he has fanned more batters than have reached base on hits and walks combined . " He 's way ahead of any young pitcher in the history of the game , " // Johnson says . " Just write superlatives . " X Fishing with the Pros continued from page 72 lectures , speaks at seminars , writes outdoor articles , and serves as a professional guide  --  all in devotion to his favorite pursuit of finding and catching crappie . " Crappie are the king of panfish , " Steve proudly says . " They are found in every state , from small farm ponds to huge rivers , and are the most sought-after species of fresh-water game fish . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86 States , but the panfish feed consistently throughout the year . " Unlike their neighbors of the underwater world , like bass , catfish , and bluegill , crappie habits place them on a year-round feeding spree , " Steve explains . " They do n't fall into a dormant stage . Thus , sport fishermen capitalize on the crappie 's year-round feeding habitats , with techniques ranging from ice fishing in Minnesota to drifting patterns in Florida . Crappie will strike a bait every season of the year , but anglers must learn to change methods and move with the fish . " Crappie are closer to the shoreline during spring , he says . Spawning takes place then , and bank fishermen can harvest a full stringer , Steve suggests , by fishing around the roots and limbs of trees , bushes , and weed beds , where the fish are laying their eggs . " If hunting for the best lakes in the country , " Steve points out , " you 'll have to consider some of the larger , man-made reservoirs of the Tennessee Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mason-Dixon tine offer excellent crappie fishing . " What signs on a body of water hint at great crappie fishing ? " Some of the ingredients for the recipe of above-average crappie fishing are lakes with moderate climates , shallow-to-average depths of 8 to 12 feet , stained water , and an abundant habitat for spawning , " Steve says . Steve McCadams , no stranger to crappie success , follows some general guidelines when stalking the spunky sunfish : " Successful anglers know that versatility is the key for consistent angling . Moving with the fish and reading sonar equipment is very important , " Steve suggests . " Modern technology has drastically improved crappie fishing , as anglers begin to utilize electronic devices like sonar , graph recorders , and liquid-crystal screens to monitor movement of the fish and submerged structures , like brush and stump rows . " The type of bait used relates to the environment you are fishing . " From the strip pits of Indiana to the shallow grass beds of Florida 's Lake Okeechobee , a fisherman can utilize a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Steve says . " Rubber-skirted jibs , which mimic bait fish , are quite popular and continued on following page come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes . When live bait is the trick , shinier minnows are ideal in the two-to three-inch range . Light wire hooks and light tackle are the most popular , but the major reservoirs often require heavy line and strong tackle for working the thick , brushy areas where crappie seek refuge . " But do n't just listen to these fishermen gab . They all agree  --  practice makes perfect . A Monarch continued from page 43 fort a fire began to kindle in him again , and the slightest arch made itself apparent in his neck . Suddenly , at the sight of an arroyo , he slid down the sloping bank and for a time made his way along its tortuous course , while on either side a shadowy army trailed him , growling and yapping above him . At last he halted and stood bewildered . The arroyo had ended in serrated sandy walls , too steep for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hind legs dragging now . He slumped for a moment , sprawled , and rising , strove to turn back . Endurance was all but gone ; he sprawled again , and it seemed as if this action were a signal . Down the sides of the arroyo they came , from the right , from the left , and behind him . They leaped at him , snapped , and darted away . He felt the sharp blades of their teeth in his haunches . And with that the smoldering thing that had been growing anew within him for the last quarter of a mile burst into life . Con-flict ! It was what he had wanted and not known , what he had longed for and not realized , and what he had looked for with those old dim eyes . It was the thing that had sent him roaring to the bars without a knowledge of why he had gone there . It was what had caused his throat to fill with roarings when he had left the train . Conflict  --  conflict  --  one more thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new life . With one foreleg bracedupon the ground , he sent the other out in a swift half circle as a coyote leaped within his range ; instantly a form traveled high above him and crashed into the right wall of the arroyo , screaming and scrambling there an instant before death should silence it . Then another form flew away ; Old Joe 's other great forepaw had swept into action now , and a second enemy lay ten feet away , bleeding out its life . The lion roared and whirled . Skulking beasts , suddenly courageous with fear , had shot behind him and were striving to pull old Joe Dokes down from the rear . He swung three of them about , their teeth hooked into his flesh , as he shifted for newer battle ; Joe Pokes was old no longer . Again those forepaws lashed and circled , again beasts leaped and darted in their frenzied efforts to evade him ; some to succeed , two more to die . All at once , in a concerted effort at flight , the remnant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the arroyo . They slipped and scrambled , and in the instant of delay a black-maned monster drove them down again by sending a hurtling , disemboweled member of their pack among them . To the bottom they came , and then , their course blocked , ratlike desperation taking the place of their usual skulking July/August ' 86 natures , they swept forward in attack , five against one . The voice of Joe Dokes rose in tremendous crescendos , roar atop roar , and these mingled with the yowling and screaming of desperate cowards . Under him and over him , at his sides and at his rear , they tormented and struck and parried and thrust . They caught him in his tender flanks ; they rolled beneath his stomach , knifelike jaws cutting with the sharpness of vicious shears . They tangled in his greasy mane and screeched their anguish as short , jabbing blows of giant claw-fringed paws lashed out with the death blow . One rolled away and was silent . Then a second was felled , and a third and a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrambling as he strove to climb out of reach . But the fanlike claws of Old Joe Pokes cut him down , and then there was only the roaring of a triumphant lion . The smell of blood was in his nostrils ; the fires of victory warmed a soul no longer warped by age . His stance was straight and strong now , forelegs spread , ears flat against his head , hind legs braced as he raised his head and cupped his red-streaked jaws . The moon was just above him and shone between serrated wails . He roared to it , the thunderous , booming roar of the monarch he once had been and the monarch he had again become . A dozen times , a score of times , he sent forth his reverberations of victory . Then turning , he sniffed about him and began to strut from one gray form to another , nosed the still-warm bodies , and pawed them or scraped the rough fur with his filelike tongue . And at the salt taste of vanquished veins he roared anew . A monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually his step slowed . After a time , he halted , as with surprise and , doubling swiftly , licked at a long , jagged place in his side where teeth had torn deep into his flesh . Then another wound began to burn , and others . Old Joe Dokes settled
