General Motors is celebrating its 75th birthday this fall at a time when the legendary giant sorely needs a good boost to its morale . The world 's largest manufacturer of motor vehicles suffered heavy blows in recent years , and a big party saluting its illustrious history is welcome indeed at GM 's venerable grey Detroit headquarters . However pleased GM might be with itself for reaching 75 , it is currently going through a period of agonizing self-examination  --  what it must do to survive the toughest challenge it has faced in its entire history : world competition . The best bet is that GM will succeed because it has summoned a new determination and is already making sweeping changes in its diverse operations . At first look , GM appears as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar and as powerful as one of its high-compression engines . It is enjoying a cyclical rebound in 1983 , with profits sure to be higher than those of the record year , 1978 . Sales are running 18 percent above 1982 and account for 44 percent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its nearest competitor , Ford , which has 17 percent . Moreover , GM 's stock price has doubled since early 1982 . Its empire of 149 facilities stretching across 40 countries and employing 672,000 men and women is a 20th-century wonder to behold . Nothing in our time has seemed so certain as GM . In its 75 years , it has : survived financial crises in 1911 and 1920 that threatened to put the then young automaker under ; struggled to overcome the 13-1 sales advantage Ford held over Chevrolet going into the ' 20s ; managed to actually grow during the Depression ; totally converted to military production in World War II , and switched just as quickly back to successful civilian output afterwards ; and congratulated itself justifiably in 1967 when it built its 100 millionth U.S.-made vehicle . But GM lives in an entirely different world today than it did even as recently as Jimmy Carter 's // presidency . " Self-assurance at GM has been greatly reduced in the last four years , " says Howard H. Kehrl , vice chairman , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly respected Kehrl is typical of what is being said in the highest echelons of 53 GM these days . GM 's leadership can still exude the optimism so familiar in this industry , but it is leavened by the realization that it has its work cut out . The new brand of optimism is based on GM 's ability and willingness to make big changes , thus enabling it to meet the challenges that seem to be overwhelming the entire U.S. auto industry . In GM 's case , it is not its old adversaries , Ford and Chrysler , that are occupying its thoughts . No , GM now is confronted  --  as are the other U.S. automakers  --  with a plethora of obstacles . If Japan appears to be the foremost headache , the developing world auto market is the greatest challenge . For decades , Detroit enjoyed the reassurance that U.S. automakers outproduced the rest of the world 's nations put together . Then , in 1958 , U.S. and Canadian production fell below half the world 's total for the first time . The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to motorbikes , to that incredibly popular mode of free , personal travel  --  the automobile , of course . In the ' 60s , it was the traditional European automakers , primarily Volkswagen , that kept Detroit alert to the new reality . By 1970 , however , Japan was challenging the Europeans and reversing its reputation for poor workmanship . Drawing heavily on the research and advice of Dr. W. Edwards Deming , the American genius on industrial quality control , the Japanese amazed Detroit . Worse yet for Detroit , the lower wages , teamwork and productivity of Japanese auto workers made it possible for Japanese subcompacts to enter the U.S. with an estimated cost advantage of 52,000 over U.S. models . Indeed , by 1980 , Japan was the world 's leading producer of automobiles . Equally vexing for GM is the destabilizing effect of the supply andprice of gasoline , and the federal government 's requirements for CAFE ( Corporate Average Fuei Economy ) , which , by the end of 1983 , must be 27 miles per gallon . Until 1974 , Americans enjoyed extraordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars with spare power for acceleration . The 1974 energy crisis pushed many Americans into smaller cars ; but as fuel prices tapered off , they went back to their larger cars . A second oil shock in 1979 again sent Americans scampering to smaller cars ( which Detroit was short of because of consumer preference for larger ones ) , and Japan had them . Caught for the second time in five years by the gyrations of the gasoline market , Detroit and GM were roundly criticized for not having the " right " cars . Japan 's share of the U.S. market climbed to 22 percent by 1982 . Since Japan specializes in smaller cars , it does n't have to worry about CAFE as U.S. automakersdo , especially GM , which is enjoying brisk sales of larger cars in 1983 . Doomsayers began speculating on the demise of the U.S. auto industry , permitting , in their optimistic moments , the notion that GM might survive in shrunken form . Some even prophesied the end of American " smokestack " industries and urged the government to subsidize " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Such predictions are a joke , " says Kehrl . " There 's no smoke coming out of the stacks anymore anyway because of federal regulations . Those pessimists do n't understand that the auto industry , particularly GM , is utilizing a great deal of high technology itself . " In the ' 70s we responded to the safety , environmental , and fuel-economy regulations of the government . Now we are occupied with changing our plants , getting our employees to work in teams and making great improvements in technology and product . We 'll have the best . " If a person familiar with the GM of 20 years ago left and came back now , he would be startled with the enormous changes . GM is spending some $40 billion in the 1980s to build " megaplants , " is deeply involved in a " Factory of the Future " project designed to wring billions out of GM 's production costs , and is plunging even deeper into new automation , including a vigorous robotics program . " American industry was always better developing innovations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president in charge of the Advanced Product and Manufacturing Engineering staff . " Competition is changing  --  we 're implementing . " One implementation is to consolidate GM 's far flung manufacturing facilities into highly integrated car-making complexes like Buick City at Flint , Michigan . At a cost of $300 million , Buick is drawing its stamping and assembly plants close together and providing land C for outside suppliers , who will also move close in . The result will be lower inventories , improved productivity and lower manufacturing cost . Currently , a fender goes through 22 steps from stamping plant until attachment to the car . Buick City 's managers promise that will be cut to 6 and assembly time for cars will drop sharply from 48 hours to 19 . ( Editor 's note : As a counter movement to this effort , many U.S. suppliers are locating their efficient U.S. plants overseas in low-cost labor areas to compete for interchangeable " world car " parts . Indeed , U.S. car manufacturers can buy car parts from foreign suppliers , including sophisticated assemblies from Third World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eaton explains , " because if you have a quality problem , you can catch the offending part sooner . " Eaton also heads GM 's " No Car Year " program , an across-thecorporation effort to develop a small car that will compete in cost and quality with anything Japan exports  --  and knock off that $2,000 advantage . Eaton is under orders to continued on following page start with a clean piece of paper , forget about the deadline pressure of coming up with a car by a certain year and eliminate every cost excess to produce this small car . This project deals with our survival , " Eaton says . " Competition will get even tougher . If we do not substantially change our way of doing business , we wo n't be here . This is the most dramatic period of change this industry has ever seen . " Perhaps the most dramatic change evident at GM is the Quality of Work Life ( QWL ) program , firmly supported by the leadership from Chairman Roger B. Smith down to plant supervisors ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it be better to say across to the team coordinators ? Smith and other top officers eat in a common dining room with production workers ( now called " assistant team coordinators " ) whenvisiting plants that very likely have eliminated traditional management/ production employee distinctions in cafeterias , locker rooms , parking lots , badges and dress codes . Eaton explains it this way : " I do n't know how it takes what has happened in recent years to make usrecognize that we 've been running this business with one-third of the intelligence that 's available and using the other two-thirds of the people strictly for their hands . We 're no different from the rest of U.S. industry on this . " The teamwork system in the Japanese auto industry has become as famous as it is productive . U.S. industry can not borrow it entirely because Japanese culture is imbued with the teamwork ethic , while America fosters individualism , i.e. , do-your-own-thing . Still , personnel experts well versed in behaviorist psychology know there are ways to successfully motivate individualistic American workers . GM usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with the Japanese threat in a world demanding automobiles , it took the plunge , establishing new arrangements for its hourly workTHE // ers  --  arrangements giving them major participation in the decision-making and operation of plants  --  curing cases of " blue collar blues . " GM 's president F. James McDonald ( increasingly called " Jim " ) , a fervent believer in QWL , passed the word that managers had better get with the new arrangements . Autocratic supervisors and other General Patton types could either cooperate or be transferred . In fact , GM is spending much time and money training its managers in the new " participatory " system . Cadillac 's Livonia Engine Plant was ideal as an early site to try QWL because it was new and unrutted by old practices . Moreover , its manager , Bob Stramy , 42 , had experienced what he calls " a radical change " when he spent a year ( ' 77- ' 78 ) in the Stanford-Sloan Program for executives at Stanford University , where he became an evangelist for change in the lifestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his office , spends a great deal of time with the plant 's United Auto Workers QWL coordinator , Ralph Fanelli , and constantly promotes " egalitarianism . " " We are breaking down the adversarial relationship which too long existed between management and workers , " Stramy says earnestly . " Bureaucracies are built on power , prestige and turf protection . We 're trying for open relationships , away from win-and-lose , and on to teaching by example . " I try to be a situational manager , not holding to rigid rules . Treat others as you would want to be treated . I learned this in that Stanford year , lost 50 pounds and got a bit freaky by growing a beard . " It made me more human and also realize that the struc-ture of industry does n't allow you to be human . Fortunately , we had a top management at GM which believed in changing this . There were visionaries  --  Ed Cole ( former GM president , now deceased ) ; Jim McDonald ; Irving Bluestone , who continued on page 98 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So when the Livonia plant started up in 1981 , a committee consisting of two representatives of the UAW , two hourly-rated workers ( a white female and a black male ) , and eight management people were formed into a plant-planning team . Somewhere in a GM Valhalla , crusty old GM managers must have fumed , and Walter Reuther , who spent a lifetime trying to involve workers in planning and operation , must have smiled in appreciation . " The company must start such a process , " Stramy explains , " to show the union it is sincere . Then to build trust , you bring in an outside training firm so the union does n't think you 're trying to put something over . It creates credibility . " We posed questions to our planning team about what they think makes a good plant and acted accordingly . Now we have 15 teams of 10 to 20 workers ( assistant team coordinators ) in the problem-solving process . When an employee learns more jobs on the team , he or she gets a baseTHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the industry . Sure , if you give some people an inch they will take a mile , but under our system , their fellow workers take care of them now . That 's better management . " Results at Cadillac 's Livonia plant ? Customer complaints about engines cut 40 percent ; a 50 percent reduction in controllable cost per engine ; a 50 percent reduction in absentees ; 23 percent fewer injuries ; and $1.2 million saved in 1982 through worker suggestions . " They are n't saying we will treat you like a human being , " observed Bob Williams , an hourly-rated assistant team coordinator . " They are more or less showing that  --  I can see it for myself . " Some believed that GM 's problem with employee productivity would take years and years to resolve , but QWL has reduced the count from many to few . Similarly , insiders thought GM would have a long struggle getting suppliers to accept the statistical process control message of Dr. Deming , who is now every auto company 's guru on improving quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes into any automobile comes from suppliers . " There 's a new gospel for them , " says Donald H. McPherson , vice president in charge of the North American car group . " Some suppliers were negative , but we told them that if you do n't have the capability of running a quality check , you wo n't be certified to sell us . You know , it actually made them run their businesses better and saves them money . Our standards for supplier quality control held back some parts we needed in this year 's good market  --  but it 's worth holding the standard . Absolutely , this should have been put in years ago . " Another sign of the accelerating progress at GM is the intensifying of its robotics program . GM now uses more robots than any company in the world . In 1982 , it formed a joint venture with Japan 's Fujitsu Fanuc Ltd. to design , manufacture and sell robotic systems . Still , GM buys robots from 29 companies other than its own and is installing them in plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robots . In 1983 , it 's 2,500 , and it will be about 5,000 by 1985 . Robots now measure , paint , assemble , drill holes , rate increase ( " Pay By Knowledge " ) . " No more foremen , only team coordinators . One young General Patton type thought he was still a supervisor and insisted on wearing an old-style gold pin on his badge . We all wear the same 1 . D. badges . He changed when we told him he could be transferred . " No more executive dining room , so Stramy and his manager eat in the plant cafeteria . They use the same bathrooms , parking spaces and locker rooms as hourly employees . Nobody wears a coat and tie . " We were n't getting anywhere the old way , " Fanelli says . " Too much fighting and not enough production . Now there are few grievances and everybody feels better . " " If GM does one thing well , " says Stramy , " it 's to take up an opportunity , and that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the dirty foundry and forging jobs workers do n't like . They are more efficient on dull , boring jobs that tire humans . But when they make a mistake , they repeat and repeat and repeat . .. . Once , a GM robot became the " most efficient light-bulb buster-upper ever " by repeatedly smashing the bulb into the instrument panels . But late-generation robots can , in effect , say " Whoops , you missed , " and correct themselves . The UAW has no qualms about them , although some plant managers do . Robots are a flexible form of automation , and one day something even more sophisticated will replace robots . The payoff for GM 's comprehensive , strenuous effort to beat foreign competition in the United States continued on page 102 102 continued from page 98 and across the world is what comes out of the plant . At Pontiac 's Fiero plant , a new two-seat sports car is now being produced for its 1984 debut , and 30,000 have been sold in advance . The Fiero , the first American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver , has aroused more interest at GM this year than any other car except , perhaps , the hot-selling new Corvette . The Fiero is built on a 93.4-inch wheelbase , powered by a 2.5-liter engine ( 95 horsepower ) , and offers an estimated 48 miles per gallon on the highway , 27 in town . It is wrapped in a polyurethane material that is said to bend and snap back on minor impact and cut body repairs enormously . The Fiero plant is managed by Ernie Schaefer , 38 , a political conservative whose belief in the new school of employee relationships is expressed in the golf shirt he wears to work and his inclination to walk up to an assembly-line worker ( assistant team coordinator ) and say , kiddingly , " If you do n't watch it , I 'll have to show you how to do that . " The employee laughs and kids Schaefer back . It 's clear he has good rapport with the people who work on the Fiero . Schaefer and Jerry Lewis , the UAW 's Fiero representative , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee involvement , an atmosphere of trust , of mutual respect and human dignity so that we may achieve our common goals of high quality , mutual success , job security , and effective community relationsh ips . Fiero 's organizational chart shows six operating teams of hourly workers working with two resource teams of supervisors and " team coordinators , " and they in turn work with business and administration teams  --  also represented by hourly workers . It 's all very egalitarian , and Schaefer likes it that way . " 1 am convinced that the ArneriTHE // can worker is the most intelligent and creative anywhere , " he says . " This is n't the Japanese system , it 's the American system . A worker who feels he should shut down the line can do it here . He or she used to get fired for that . But now we know there must be a good reason for an employee to shut that line down . " This sort of new openness is generally found among such young GM professionals as Zara Rolfes , 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides helping make key decisions on what went into the 1984 Corvette , Zara played a major role in the effort to eliminate numerous squeaks and rattles in the Camaro . She also test drove Camaros and Corvettes to check the stabilizer-bar action . The daughter of an Indianapolis engineer , Zara got her mechanical-engineering degree from Purdue University in 1979 with a straight-A average . GM spotted Zara as a college freshman and hired her for summer work in product planning . She is completely sold on GM and is sometimes dispatched to project that enthusiasm to college audiences . " There is so much opportunity and so much needing to be done at GM , " Zara says . " If you have a goal you can tap the resources of the entire company . There is spectacular participation . We go to dinner with hourly workNovember ' 83 ers just to talk about the Camaro . " GM will need large quantities of this enthusiasm to go with its $50 billion reconstruction program and its new methods for operating plants and working with its people . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the auto markets outside the United States and Canada . GM has always lagged behind Ford in overseas operations , because Henry Ford was the first to see the world opportunity . In recent years , GM has nearly closed the gap with Ford by extending its sales operations to 100 countries . Europe , not the United States , is the world 's largest auto market , and in 1982 Europe recorded more new-car registrations than the United States and Canada combined . Therefore , GM is greatly encouraged that so far in 1983 it is only one percent behind the European car-sales leader , Italy 's Fiat . GM 's new complex at Zaragoza , Spain , can build a whopping 270,000 cars a year , and ranks among the most technologically advanced facilities in the world . The U.S. car market will grow , but not as fast as the world market , and the lessons GM learns as it revamps its U.S. plants will be extended to its growing complex of facilities overseas . People are peo- ple . And if there is anything constant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it celebrates its 75th birthday with open house events across the republic and 50 " Up With People " concerts , GM will be dipping into its history for guidance and even inspiration . Altogether , the rebuilding effort and the celebration should give GM a shot of its old confidence . " GM always responded to opportunities , " observes Thomas Aquinas Murphy , the retired chairman and chief executive of GM . " You know back in the ' 20s , our great people like Alfred Sloan , Pierre DuPont and Albert Bradley had to work hard to convince Wall Street that GM had staying power . Withcontinued on page 112 112 continued from page 102 out their effort , GM could have gone under . Sloan saw the opportunity to take this disconnected collection of auto companies and make it into a cohesive whole . " The big changes of today at GM are in keeping with the company 's philosophy . Alfred Sloan always believed in reward for performance . But unionization interfered with that philosophy . Direct dialogue with the work force would have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profit-sharing programs . They were overdue . So was our Quality For Worklife . " You know , GM is a product of the 20th century . When I came to the company in 1937 , we were n't even 30 years old  --  only 15 if you mark it from the end of the William Crapo Durant period . I 've been with the company 46 years ? am still on the board  --  and I regard GM as a young company . We are here to stay . " Murphy 's successor is Roger B. Smith , who took over as chairman in 1981 . As GM celebrated its 75th , Smith felt a bit expansive and took an optimistic look at the future that verged on being outright bullish . " It 's the 1990s , " Smith proclaimed . " Automobile manufacturers have just established new sales records for both North America and the world . In intense competition , GM has once again strengthened its position as the world 's leading producer . " Smith goes on to credit the " No Car Year " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars in the Nos. 1 , 2 and 4 spots on the U.S. best-car-sellers list . He sees North American new-car and - truck sales exceeding 20 million units for the first time . He sees highly flexible automation , and robots performing the tough , dirty tasks , and highly skilled employees working without direct supervision and with full authority and responsibility for their own operations . He refers back to the ' 80s as the time of " one of the most introspective looks GM // had ever taken at itself . " Whether Smith 's predictions are a harkening of things to come or izierely brave words when Japan is phasing out its voluntary restraints on exports to the United States  --  well , we wo n't have to wait 75 years to find out . At this point the smart money is riding on GM . ' A
