The strike was widespread and militant from the start . In Boston , 14 striking New England Telephone workers were arrested for blocking the company 's repair trucks . Customers in New York , New Jersey and California lost service when phone lines were sabotaged . In Van Nuys , Calif. , two striking Pacific Bell employees suffered injuries when they were bumped by cars crossing the picket lines . The drivers " got angry because we called them scabs , " claimed Marisa Rotondi , a shop steward for the local union . " Things are starting to get pretty bad out here . " <P> Nearly 160,000 telephone operators , installers and repair workers in 15 states launched strikes last week against three regional U.S. telephone companies : Bell Atlantic , NYNEX and Pacific Telesis . While direct-dial calls in the affected regions were handled smoothly by automatic switching equipment , customers encountered delays in getting directory assistance , repair service and phone installation . <P> The two striking unions , the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , are taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-stakes labor issue : medical benefits . In an era of rising health-care costs , companies are trying to shift more of the burden to employees . Workers , on the other hand , look upon their medical benefits as hard-won rights that have become essential to maintaining their standard of living . Declared picket signs last week : CUTTING OUR HEALTH BENEFITS IS SICK . <P> While wages have increased at an annual rate of 3.3% since 1983 , corporations have seen their health-care premiums jump 10% to 15% annually , to a current average of some $3,100 a worker . Economists expect that total U.S. health-care spending will exceed $600 billion this year , nearly 12% of the U.S. gross national product , up from 9.1% in 1980 . <P> Many employers have tried to attack the problem from two angles . Hoping to get better prices for service , companies have negotiated favorable rates for their employees at certain hospitals and health-maintenance organizations . To reduce outlays further , more than 70% of companies require employees to pay at least some of the costs of insuring themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negotiators for Bell Atlantic want the company 's employees , who currently pay a $150 deductible for nonhospital medical care , to take on a $150 deductible for hospitalization and an additional $200 deductible for any treatment outside a prescribed network of doctors and hospitals . " The whole idea is to make consumers thoughtful buyers and to stop rising health-care costs by asking them to put something at stake , " says Bell Atlantic spokesman Kenneth Pitt . <P> The problem with that approach , some health-care experts say , is that employees have even less control over medical costs than do corporations . " What can an ordinary phoneworker do about the prices that hospitals and physicians charge ? " asks Dale Hiestand , professor of corporate relations at the Columbia University School of Business . A better solution , union leaders argue , is to work harder to keep costs down . They point to a program at BellSouth in which managers and employees have joined forces to cut costs , enabling the Atlanta-based company to keep its generous health-care coverage intact .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
