Can you imagine turning in a spectacular 95 percent fund gain in your latest fiscal year and not being elated ? Well , that ' s the way I found Michael Steinhardt ; he showed up for dinner perplexed and worried . " My vision ' s unclear , " the Wall Street superstar told me , referring to his near-term outlook for the stock and bond markets . " It ' s hard for me to stay in cash . People are paying me to make a bet , but at the moment I don ' t feel smart enough to make a bet either way . . . . And at the current level of prices in both stocks and bonds , I don ' t think any serious bet is justified . " Surprising words indeed from the portly 41-year-old Steinhardt , a powerhouse in Wall Street because of the huge brokerage commissions he doles out , but little known to the public . As head of Steinhardt Partners , a three-fund $190 million money- management complex , Steinhardt is one of Wall Street ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell and sell short ( a bet on lower prices ) millions of dollars worth of stocks each day . But Steinhardt , nervously smoking one cigarette after another , tells me he refuses to be drawn into the buying stampede in either stocks or bonds . " If I had to guess the market between now and year- end , I ' d guess up , " he says . " But at current prices , the stock and bond markets are assuming an imminent and sustained recovery . And if that doesn ' t happen , you ' ve got real vulnerability . " In Steinhardt ' s view , doing nothing is also a judgment . And for the time being , he says , " the cream - and perhaps a lot of the milk , as well - is out of both markets . " Some Wall Streeters might be critical of Steinhardt for equivocating - but surely not his clients . They can ' t help but love him after his super performance in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 . That 95 percent gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steinhardt Partners ( assets : $90 million ) . And it was achieved on the success of a tremendously risky bet - the purchase in a heavily volatile interest-rate environment of $250 million worth of bonds , mostly five-year Treasuries , with only $55 million worth of assets . In other words , there was heavy use of leverage ( or borrowing power ) , immeasurably heightening the risk . There were days and probably weeks when Steinhardt undoubtedly regretted making that bet . At one point , for example , the fund ' s bond portfolio showed a wicked $10 million loss . And rumors were making the rounds that the 15-year- old firm was in trouble . But these rumors quickly died down as Steinhardt subsequently proved to be right on target on his thesis - namely , that the economy would weaken faster than expected , causing a healthy drop in interest rates and correspondingly a sharp rise in bond prices . Actually , the yields on those five-year Treasuries plummeted from 16 percent to 11 1/2 percent and that huge paper loss hanging over Steinhardt Partners turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 90 percent of the fund ' s fiscal 1982 gain . After giving effect to its partners ' fees - equivalent to $9 million , or 20 percent of roughly $45 million of profits - the fund ' s gain narrowed to 76 percent . In the same 12-month period , the Standard &; Poor ' s 500-stock index , after dividend inclusion , posted a 9.6 percent increase . Steinhardt ' s lack of clarity about where the stock and bond markets might be headed is clearly reflected in the firm ' s largely underinvested portfolio . Bond holdings , for example , have been shrunk to about $16 million . There ' s about $15 million in short sales and $14 million in longs ( stocks the fund owns ) . And the rest is in cash . " I ' ve always felt you can ' t make money without getting in the way of harm , " Steinhardt says . " But unless you perceive that the rewards justify the risks , you should - however uncomfortable - stay in cash . . .

Apple ' s management recently estimated a 70 percent gain in fourth- quarter profits ; nonetheless , Steinhardt views Apple as " a deteriorating company " in a highly competitive field . As for Baldwin-United , a sprawling financial conglomerate that earlier this year acquired MGIC Corp. , the nation ' s biggest private mortgage insurer , Steinhardt characterizes the firm as " a painfully leveraged ( heavily debt- ridden ) company whose financial reporting is beyond the understanding of this mere mortal . " Other Steinhardt shorts include MCI , Lockheed , Amdahl and General Instruments . On the long side , Steinhardt ' s current largest holdings are IBM , Kodak , Dresser Industries and International Minerals &; Chemicals .
