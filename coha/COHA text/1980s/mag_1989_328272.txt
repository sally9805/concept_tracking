He lived there for years , and New Yorkers even named a street in his honor . But these days would dapper Duke Ellington feel at ease taking the A train 2 1/2 miles north from midtown Manhattan to black Harlem ? Not if he believed the vision this New York City community conjures up in the minds of apprehensive whites : a postnuclear landscape of poverty and blight , where crack dealers plan gang wars in cratered tenements . To most Manhattanites from the wealthy southern part of the island , Harlem hardly exists , except as an old , obscure head wound  --  the beast in the attic , a maximum-security prison for the American Dream 's unruly losers . Why would a white person go to this Harlem , except to buy drugs ? <P> Now pose the question to a white European visiting New York City , and brace yourself for a surprise . He will inform you that black Harlem is one of the city 's main attractions ; that its 330 years echo with history , beauty and drama ; that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exuberant black metropolis that flourished in the 1920s ; that in no other New York City district can you find the vitality and graciousness of Harlem on a , good day . Maybe , too , the foreigner wants to brag to friends back home that he saw Harlem and survived .

They gasp at the area 's high and low life and attend a joyful church service . Typically , few of the tourists are black ; fewer are New Yorkers . On a recent trip , one of these few spoke with a librarian at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downtowner asked if many New Yorkers took such tours , the librarian smiled : " Honey , you 're about the first . " <P> Is the white American who avoids Harlem missing something ? Yes : for starters , a poignant and profound social textbook lying open for study in the heart of a great city . One gazes at block after block of abandoned brownstones  --  their fronts corked by arson , their doorways cemented shut , their empty windows gaping like a skeleton 's eye sockets  --  and realizes that agonizing irony is Harlem 's chief industry . Perhaps , then , the European tourists are seeing things . Yes , they are : spectacular things . Any tour of Harlem compresses into a few square miles the melodramatic contradictions of urban life . Horror dwells in the basement of propriety . Hope is just around the corner from drugs and decay .
