Of the many measures of fame , one of the more useful is the injury-report index . A star makes the papers by dying . A superstar need only be hospitalized : when Sinatra 's diverticula act up , you know about it . Higher up the celebrity scale are stars of a magnitude for which we have no adequate word and for whose well-being we can never have enough concern . Sitting monarchs and Presidents , for example . Two weeks ago Ronald Reagan incurred a " small , red bump " on his eyelid ( caused by a contact lens ) . You could read about it on page 3 of the Washington Post . A classic of the genre is an item that ran in the New York Times a couple of years ago : GLASS CUTS KISSINGER 'S NOSE . Only a nick really , and he 'd been out of power for nine years . <P> Today and for at least 15 more minutes , Ollie North is in that class . If he were to sustain a paper cut , presses would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most interesting and mysterious American institution is not the National Security Council or the congressional investigation but celebrityhood . Ollie North was made , as Gary Hart was unmade , in less than a week . Only in America can a man be created between two Sabbaths . And not just the man but the cult . The gavel has barely fallen on the last senatorial reproach to North and we already have Ollie dolls , an Ollie video , the " Ollie cut " and Ollie songs ( Hooray for Olliewood , Ollie B. Good ) . <P> This has offended many deep thinkers . Crucial constitutional questions of official secrecy , separation of powers , chain of command and the like were highlighted by North 's testimony . Deep thinkers are offended that the masses have lost sight of them in Olliemania . But these questions have hardly been neglected . For the past eight months the country 's op-ed pages have conducted a national seminar on the conflicting demands of secrecy , democracy and constitutionality . <P> Ollie 's rise has made grumpy those for whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glee . They are dismayed that the country will not focus on important matters , say , on whether the presidential finding authorizing the Israeli second arms shipment was in compliance with the Hughes-Ryan amendment . Such matters , often referred to as the " facts , " are overlooked while the nation takes in Ollie 's hair , his uniform , his smile , his glint , his hound-dog eyes and his patriotic speeches . Millions swoon . The sophisticates despair . <P> The congressional committees in particular were stunned by the media monster they created . Fitting punishment for their hypocrisy : first , the committees create a courtroom drama , complete with sharp lawyers shredding hapless witnesses on live television ; then the committees complain that America has been captivated by a witness 's manner instead of concentrating on his words and deeds . Ca n't have it both ways . Turn an inquiry into a spectacle and you can not protest that the audience is insufficiently attentive to the transcript . The Iran-contra committees could have modestly pursued their business off-camera , as did the Tower commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made public at the close of the investigation . Then there would have been no Ollie  --  only Colonel North , the slightly disreputable , if not discredited , " switching point " ( Poindexter 's phrase ) of the political scandal of the decade .
